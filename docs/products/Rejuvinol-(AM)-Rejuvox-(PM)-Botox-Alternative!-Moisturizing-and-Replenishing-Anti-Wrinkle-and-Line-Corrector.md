<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Based on clinical trial information I&#x27;ve been able to find, this product does, apparently, work and is priced below a lot of similar products.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth the several hundred dollars&#x27; savings over cosmetic procedures (unless you&#x27;re looking for REALLY dramatic results).  I am, however, always leery of \\&quot;consumer\\&quot; product reviews and would advise anyone to look into actual clinical research on a product before buying it.  What works for one person might not work for another, too, so be prepared for that possibility before spending this amount of money.  Oh, and there is no \\&quot;Dr. Gary Adell\\&quot; licensed to practice medicine in the state of Arizona, nor is there a \\&quot;Doctors Wellness Institute\\&quot; anywhere in the state.  Just another reminder that just because you read a product testimonial, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s an honest one.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these for the 26-34 year age group because that is the age bracket where you start really seeing lines on your face and are young enough to start preventing them from getting worse.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The younger you start a healthy skin practice the more youthful you&#x27;ll appear to people when u hit your 30&#x27;s. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am 33 and are always mistaken for 25-26 it&#x27;s a huge compliment. It&#x27;s not like I am fighting aging, I just want to look as young as I feel. I do watch my diet and exercise regularly to maintain an overall youthful image. I am very thankful to the makers of these wonderful products. They are right up there in my book!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have been using the rejuvinol am/pm product for over 30 days now and i must say that i am very happy with the product so far. my lines around my eyes have dimished to be almost non-existent! i wasnt that bad to start but i figured what the hell, let me give it a shot. i cant believe that this atually worked! i will continue to use this product and hopefully this will keep me looking younger and younger!  HEHEHE</li>
    <li> I am clearly amazed with this product. I was recommended these creams by a woman in her mid 40&#x27;s in my office...she looks amazing. &lt;br /&gt;I like the consistency and fragrance. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Rejuvinol and Rejuvox seem to be working for me. I have a friend that recommended these to me. I really value her opinion when it comes to beauty related treatments and products because of her esthetics background.</li>
    <li> I wrote a negative review regarding Rejuvinol. \\&quot;Someone\\&quot; pretending to me posted a message after my review apologizing and saying it was a mistake. I think it is obvious who would have done this. My real review stands as stated. I did not confuse the product. I was speaking of REJUVINOL by DERMALOGICS (Bodestore).  &lt;br /&gt;You are not reflecting well on your company or your product. Is there no tactic you will not stoop to? How incredibly unethical.</li>
    <li> An effective product deep lines are much less noticable and surface lines have all but disappeared. It comes in an AM and PM formula and applies very nicely. Fragrance is like a fresh tangerine.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

    <li> If you like the feel of paste on you face and a dry sensation all day or night, then this is the cream for you.  There doesn&#x27;t appear to be any moisturizing agent whatsoever in this.  Simply amazing that a company like Amazon would have such a product link. Don&#x27;t waste your time nor your money on this one.</li>
    <li> I heard alot about tihs product and decided to give it a try as i was skeptical. The first few days i didnt see much but by the first week i could really notice and FEEL a difference. I have been suing this for 3 weeks now and can honeslty say that this stuff really works!! I recommend this for anyone looking to hav smooth wrinkle free skin!!</li>
    <li> I have used these creams for over 2 weeks now and i really like how it works. My skin feels smooth and i think i can actually see the wrinkles near my eyes thinning out!! The cream is easy to apply and the morning formula smels great. I think this product is wonderful</li>
    <li> Hello. I have been using the Rejuvinol for 6 weeks and I love the results. My skin is smoother and the fine lines have all but disappeared. Product is fantastic. Will continue to use it and now my mom is hooked as well.</li>
    <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and beginning to show fine lines.  I tried this product- both am and pm cream for a month.  I did not notice a difference!  This was very disappointmenting, especially after reading all the rave reviews. A $100 is a lot to give up so think twice before you buy this product.  If your going to buy it, make sure you return it before the 30 day trial period if you are not happy with your results.  Based on my experience, this cream does not deliver as it advertises.</li>
    <li> How can anyone even think about giving this company money when they have to give themselves the raving reviews. Plus what&#x27;s up with the childish games they&#x27;re playing by copying and pasting and re-wording an actual review?</li>
    <li> This is the WORST product ever!  After using it EXACTLY as the instructions stated, my wrinkles were enhanced and my face was extremely dry.  There was no relaxing of the wrinkles, in fact, new ones appeared since the product dried my face so drastically.  I looked like I had aged 20 years in one month of use.  I only purchased the product due to the glowing reviews I had read on amazon.  I tried Rejuvinol and Rejuvox, HATED them and tried to return them.  The seller ignored me so I was unable to return the product. I wrote a negative review about the product on amazon. To add insult to injury, the seller changed my negative review into a positive review using my user name only minutes later after I posted my negative comment.  The seller is writing their own glowing reviews on amazon about this product which is AWFUL!!!! They could not do the right thing and let me return the junky product as I was within my return period.  Instead they ignored me and was hoping I would go away.    I complained to amazon but amazon did not want to get involved as they get commissions from the sale of this product.  Just watch, there will be a flood of positive postings on this product and they will also leave a bunch of blank spaces between all of the negative comments and their own positive reviews.  Also, if I was a betting person, I would expect that this review is removed so that all of the unsuspecting people will think that this product is a wonder product and they will at first hesitate to spend the money on this product and then after reading all of the glowing reviews written by this seller, they will spend the outrageous purchase price.  They will then learn what the rest of us burned population learned that this product is garbage and they will be sadly disappointed.  All I can say is learn from my expensive mistake and if you really want something that will relax your wrinkles, use botox! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Do NOT waste your money, do not purchase this product because if youdo, you will be very sorry!  Remember this review!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend Rejuvinol and Rejuvox to everyone. These are great products! They knocked years off my skin.</li>
    <li> For close to $100, I was expecting nothing shy of a miracle. I spent a lot of money for this cream and it doesn&#x27;t do anything, absolutely nothing. If anything it made me break out even more while I was on vacation with the humid air. I started getting really bad deep painful pimples and it wasn&#x27;t just 1, I ended up with 6 so I had to stop using it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the company/manufacturer needs to stop with the \\&quot;5 star reviews\\&quot; and let us, the consumer, write our own opinions.</li>
    <li> The evening cream isn&#x27;t too bad it&#x27;s the daytime cream that you have to \\&quot;cake\\&quot; on and it&#x27;s extremely overdrying. It&#x27;s alot of money to spend on a product where you can only use one part of it. The smell is pleasant but I&#x27;m upset about the cost and the fact I can use only one jar of it.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Who would have thought a stretch mark cream would turn out to be the anti-wrinkle breakthrough of the decade!\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a remarkable turn of events, arguably one of the strangest in the history of cosmetics, women across the country are putting a stretch-mark cream called Rejuvinol AM/PM on their face to diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and crows&#x27; feet. And, if consumer sales are any indication of a product&#x27;s effectiveness, Rejuvinol AM/PM is nothing short of a miracle. Women, as well as a growing number of \\&quot;Boomer\\&quot; men, are buying so much Rejuvinol AM/PM that finding a tube at your local cosmetic counter has become just about impossible. Has everyone gone mad? Well...not really.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scientific Breakthrough or Dumb Luck?  &lt;br /&gt;Although Rejuvinol AM/PM functional components were already backed by clinical trials documenting their ability to visibly reduce the appearance of existing stretch marks (prominent because of their depth, length, discoloration and texture)... the success of Rejuvinol AM/PM as an anti-wrinkle cream was \\&quot;dumb luck,\\&quot; says Rudy Gay, spokesperson for Dermalogics, Rejuvinol AM/PM manufacturer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When we first handed out samples of the Rejuvinol AM/PM formula to employees and customers as part of our market research, the sample tubes were simply marked \\&quot;topical cream\\&quot; with the lot number underneath,\\&quot; Mr. Gay explains. \\&quot;As the samples were passed to friends and family, the message became a little muddled and some people used this \\&quot;topical cream\\&quot; as a facial moisturizer. As we began to receive feedback from users, like \\&quot;I look 10 years younger\\&quot; and \\&quot;I can&#x27;t even notice my crows&#x27; feet\\&quot; we knew we had something more than America&#x27;s most effective stretch-mark cream. The point was driven home as store owners began reporting that almost as many people were purchasing Rejuvinol as an anti-wrinkle cream as were buying it to reduce stretch marks.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Steven Lebowitz, PhD, Dermalogic&#x27;s Director ofScientific Affairs, says, \\&quot;Clearly, people were seeing results, but we didn&#x27;t have a scientific explanation as to why this wrinkle-reduction was occurring. However, based on the incredibly positive reports, I started using it myself applying Rejuvinol to my face after shaving.\\&quot; Dr. Lebowitz adds, \\&quot;On a personal note, my wife tells me I haven&#x27;t looked this good in years.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dumb Luck Strikes Again!  &lt;br /&gt;Then, on Tuesday, July 2, 2003, at a meeting of the 20th World Congress of Dermatology in Paris, France, a series of studies detailing the superior wrinkle-reducing properties of a patented oligo-peptide \\&quot;called Pal-KTTKS\\&quot; versus retinol, vitamin C, and placebo, on \\&quot;photo-aged skin\\&quot; was presented.1,2 \\&quot;As luck would have it,\\&quot; Dr. Lebowitz states, \\&quot;the anti-wrinkle oligo-peptide tested in the breakthrough clinical trials turned out to be a key ingredient in the Rejuvinol cream.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the trials, subjects applied the patented peptide solution to the crows&#x27; feet area on one side of the face, and a cream containing either retinol, vitamin C, or a placebo to the other side.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Subjects in the Pal-KTTKS/retinol study applied the cream once a day for 2 months and then twice a day for the next 2 months. Using special image analysis, the study&#x27;s authors reported \\&quot;significant improvement\\&quot; in both the overall appearance of skin tone and wrinkles for those women using the peptide solution.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Better yet, at the 2-month halfway point, the peptide solution worked nearly 1.5 times faster than retinol \\&quot;in measured parameters,\\&quot; and without the inflammation retinol often causes in sensitive skin. As was expected, the results of the remaining studies confirmed that the Pal-KTTKS solution&#x27;s effectiveness at reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles far exceeded both vitamin C and placebo.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A smoother, younger complexion, with less irritation and faster results-all without expensive (and painful) peels, implants or injections.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Better than Retinol and Vitamin C, But Is Rejuvinol AM/PM Better than Botox?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jennifer Cifelli, PhD, RD, Director of Women&#x27;s Health at Minneapolis based Golden Sun Systems, exclusive distributor for Dermalogics, explains, \\&quot;Leading dermatologists agree that Botox is the preferred treatment for moderate to severe frown lines between the brow. But ever since it was discovered that Rejuvinol could reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and crows&#x27; feet... the kind of fine lines, wrinkles and crows feet that can add 10-15 years to your appearance and which costly medical treatments often leave behind... skin-care professionals have been recommending, and using, Rejuvinol.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In fact, researchers believe non-invasive alternatives are better, because, Dr. Cifelli continues, \\&quot;Topical creams and gels offer gradual, continual results, while the effects of injections, facial peels, and dermabrasions are rougher on the skin and wear off.\\&quot; In other words, Rejuvinol AM/PM helps give you a youthful, healthy, glowing complexion faster than retinol, far superior to vitamin C, and without irritation, needles, or surgery. Even better, many dermatologists and plastic surgeons recommend Rejuvinol AM/PM in conjunction with cosmetic procedures, including Botox.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, if you see someone applying an anti-stretch mark cream to their face, don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve gone off the deep end... they may be smarter than you think.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>

    <li> I got my bottles on Tuesday last ... and began using it that evening, and twice a day since then ... so 9 days, counting this morning.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, it should be realized that I have never used an \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; product before ... and I&#x27;m 54, with oil-prone skin [especially in my T-zone] that is both sensitive and prone to breakouts.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was only after I managed to get my face clear [via OCM ... thank you ladies] that I realized I had some \\&quot;catch up\\&quot; work to do in that area. So I&#x27;ve been using eye creams and Vitamin C serum since late August.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The wrinkles above my lip ... under my nose ... were fairly deep ... particularly around a scar I have from a dog bite I got about 2.5 years ago. [Long story ... very embarrassing ... Rolling Eyes ] At any rate ... I have rather deep wrinkling in that area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am, by nature, skeptical of these sorts of things ... and I was particularly skeptical that Rejubinol AM/PM would help with the lines around this scar. After all, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;normal\\&quot; wrinkling.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate \\&quot;softening\\&quot; but after two days, I was surprised to note that the \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; near the eye were almost non-existent ... and the deeper lines in that area had \\&quot;shortened\\&quot; and softened.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What was even more astonishing was that the lines near my scar [above my lip] were also softened! (Laughing)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought this was simply my imagination. After all ... you put a product onto an area and you hope/expect that it will do what it claims to do. (Laughing)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This morning, however, I looked more closely ... with my 12X magnifying mirror ... and sure enough ... fine lines have \\&quot;disappeared\\&quot; and my deeper lines have softened so much that it&#x27;s readily visible.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of the lines around the scarred area are \\&quot;gone\\&quot; ... while the deeper ones in this area have softened considerably as well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everywhere I have applied this product ... the fine lines ... gone. Deeper lines ... shorter and softer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I put this on, I don&#x27;t notice a \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; sensation so much as a \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; sensation. You do feel it working ... and now I know that it&#x27;s not just a sensation ... it&#x27;s actually working!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I now wish I&#x27;d figured out how to take my own picture \\&quot;before\\&quot; so that I could compare the photos ... but it&#x27;s not my imagination ... this stuff is truly marvellous!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank you again, for offering this wonderful product! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Who would have thought a stretch mark cream would turn out to be the anti-wrinkle breakthrough of the decade!\\&quot;     In a remarkable turn of events, arguably one of the strangest in the history of cosmetics, women across the country are putting a stretch-mark cream called Rejuvinol AM/PM on their face to diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and crows&#x27; feet. And, if consumer sales are any indication of a product&#x27;s effectiveness, Rejuvinol AM/PM is nothing short of a miracle. Women, as well as a growing number of \\&quot;Boomer\\&quot; men, are buying so much Rejuvinol AM/PM that finding a tube at your local cosmetic counter has become just about impossible. Has everyone gone mad? Well...not really.     Scientific Breakthrough or Dumb Luck?   Although Rejuvinol AM/PM functional components were already backed by clinical trials documenting their ability to visibly reduce the appearance of existing stretch marks (prominent because of their depth, length, discoloration and texture)... the success of Rejuvinol AM/PM as an anti-wrinkle cream was \\&quot;dumb luck,\\&quot; says Rudy Gay, spokesperson for Dermalogics, Rejuvinol AM/PM manufacturer.     When we first handed out samples of the Rejuvinol AM/PM formula to employees and customers as part of our market research, the sample tubes were simply marked \\&quot;topical cream\\&quot; with the lot number underneath,\\&quot; Mr. Gay explains. \\&quot;As the samples were passed to friends and family, the message became a little muddled and some people used this \\&quot;topical cream\\&quot; as a facial moisturizer. As we began to receive feedback from users, like \\&quot;I look 10 years younger\\&quot; and \\&quot;I can&#x27;t even notice my crows&#x27; feet\\&quot; we knew we had something more than America&#x27;s most effective stretch-mark cream. The point was driven home as store owners began reporting that almost as many people were purchasing Rejuvinol as an anti-wrinkle cream as were buying it to reduce stretch marks.\\&quot;     Dr. Steven Lebowitz, PhD, Dermalogic&#x27;s Director of Scientific Affairs, says, \\&quot;Clearly, people were seeing results, but we didn&#x27;t have a scientific explanation as to why this wrinkle-reduction was occurring. However, based on the incredibly positive reports, I started using it myself applying Rejuvinol to my face after shaving.\\&quot; Dr. Lebowitz adds, \\&quot;On a personal note, my wife tells me I haven&#x27;t looked this good in years.\\&quot;     Dumb Luck Strikes Again!   Then, on Tuesday, July 2, 2003, at a meeting of the 20th World Congress of Dermatology in Paris, France, a series of studies detailing the superior wrinkle-reducing properties of a patented oligo-peptide \\&quot;called Pal-KTTKS\\&quot; versus retinol, vitamin C, and placebo, on \\&quot;photo-aged skin\\&quot; was presented.1,2 \\&quot;As luck would have it,\\&quot; Dr. Lebowitz states, \\&quot;the anti-wrinkle oligo-peptide tested in the breakthrough clinical trials turned out to be a key ingredient in the Rejuvinol cream.\\&quot;     In the trials, subjects applied the patented peptide solution to the crows&#x27; feet area on one side of the face, and a cream containing either retinol, vitamin C, or a placebo to the other side.     Subjects in the Pal-KTTKS/retinol study applied the cream once a day for 2 months and then twice a day for the next 2 months. Using special image analysis, the study&#x27;s authors reported \\&quot;significant improvement\\&quot; in both the overall appearance of skin tone and wrinkles for those women using the peptide solution.     Better yet, at the 2-month halfway point, the peptide solution worked nearly 1.5 times faster than retinol \\&quot;in measured parameters,\\&quot; and without the inflammation retinol often causes in sensitive skin. As was expected, the results of the remaining studies confirmed that the Pal-KTTKS solution&#x27;s effectiveness at reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles far exceeded both vitamin C and placebo.     A smoother, younger complexion, with less irritation and faster results-all without expensive (and painful) peels, implants or injections.     Better than Retinol and Vitamin C, But Is Rejuvinol AM/PM Better than Botox?     Dr. Jennifer Cifelli, PhD, RD, Director of Women&#x27;s Health at Minneapolis based Golden Sun Systems, exclusive distributor for Dermalogics, explains, \\&quot;Leading dermatologists agree that Botox is the preferred treatment for moderate to severe frown lines between the brow. But ever since it was discovered that Rejuvinol could reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and crows&#x27; feet... the kind of fine lines, wrinkles and crows feet that can add 10-15 years to your appearance and which costly medical treatments often leave behind... skin-care professionals have been recommending, and using, Rejuvinol.\\&quot;     In fact, researchers believe non-invasive alternatives are better, because, Dr. Cifelli continues, \\&quot;Topical creams and gels offer gradual, continual results, while the effects of injections, facial peels, and dermabrasions are rougher on the skin and wear off.\\&quot; In other words, Rejuvinol AM/PM helps give you a youthful, healthy, glowing complexion faster than retinol, far superior to vitamin C, and without irritation, needles, or surgery. Even better, many dermatologists and plastic surgeons recommend Rejuvinol AM/PM in conjunction with cosmetic procedures, including Botox.     So, if you see someone applying an anti-stretch mark cream to their face, don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve gone off the deep end... they may be smarter than you think.</li>
    <li> This product has been described as the next best thing i see. I see so many good reviews from many satisfied customers and decided that i had to try the product for mysel;f after wasting so much money on other products which did nothing for me. Ofcourse i was speculative about the reviews and the price but i have read in ALOT of different places about this Rejuvinol product that it couldnt just be coincidence. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In my case, after 2 weeks of use, I have seen a difference in my wrinkles, and I had no breakouts! The Dermafreeze was the worst I have ever experienced but not Rejuvinol! Since then, I have done futher research on this product, and it seems like every study i find that has an ingredient that works i find out that it is being used in the Rejuvinol AM/PM formula. Needless to say i am very impressed!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you like the sound of this product, try to find independent reviews like i did and you&#x27;ll see that this is the real thing and is a must try!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;****ANOTHER REVIEW WRITTEN BY MY FRIEND REGINA**** &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I gave my skin a break for about a week in case it was just a matter of getting used to the product, then tried again. After 3 days I had noticed more reducing in wrinkles than before! all along my jawline (where I have never had luck before) and on both sides of my eyes. I had some pretty deep lines but they all seem to be getting lighter and lighter. In addition to the lines going away, I have seen an absolutely huge difference to my wrinkles around my forehead (frown lines), so all I can say is, THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I hope everyone who is in the market for a product like this will believe in me and my actual review. I can see there are some people who must have a chip on their shoulder or be from another company and be real jealous but try for yourself and you&#x27;ll be happy like me!</li>
    <li> I really like the rejuvinol cream and i think the am/pm creams were a great idea. i like the fact that i can use on in the morning and one at night. i do feel like my skin responds better to dffernt creams and so seperating them was good for me. i did not expereince and drying of the skin but did notice the lines going away somewhat. i also think these reviews are great and was a big reason why i bought this product.</li>
    <li> At first I felt like they were drying my complexion, but come to realize it was the \\&quot;freezing\\&quot; ingredient making that sensation occur.  &lt;br /&gt;I see a big difference in the fine lines and the over-all appearance of my skin. I will keep on using these products.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have found the Rejuvinol system to be excellent. I am experiencing great moisturiztion on the skin and an overall tighter and firmer complexion. I did research on the active ingredient argiriline and not surprisingly the medical information on it really good. It was quite surprising maybe you will find it helpful.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline is the name of the molecule acetyl hexapeptide-3. When applied topically, Argireline seems to have an effect similar to that of BOTOX? injections on the muscles of the face. Peptides are small fragments of proteins. Proteins are the main building blocks of nearly all living tissues. Argireline, acetyl hexapeptide-3, is a chain of six amino acids that are attached to the residue of acetic acid. Topical application of Argireline is the only method of delivery that as yet has been tested.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline relaxes facial tension, leading to the relaxation of facial muscles that contribute to lines and wrinkles. Researchers think Argireline works by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters released by the brain that tell these facial muscles to tense. The result is relaxed musculature and reduced wrinkles and lines. The Argireline&#x27;s effects are very similar to those of BOTOX? injections. But where the FDA only allows BOTOX? serum to be injected in limited areas of the face, Argireline may be applied wherever lines and wrinkles appear. One published study showed a 30% reduction in wrinkle size after only 30 days of using Argireline or its generic equivalent, acetyl hexapeptide-3.Yes. Argireline is one of the most exciting ingredients to come along in recent years. Argireline works on mechanical lines and tension-related wrinkles and therefore makes an excellent combination with other, more traditional, anti wrinkle ingredients that work by resurfacing and moisturizing the skin.Argireline is a favorable and promising alternative to botox injections and one that is highlyrecommended when found in anti aging skin care products that have additional effective ingredients. Look for Argireline or acetyl hexapeptide-3 in the ingredients before you buy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;To the previous poster, Lydie... THANK YOU for making my day. I was quite the unhappy camper when I decided to write a review here. Like some others, the creams didn&#x27;t do a thing for me amd I thought I must be the only oddball it didn&#x27;t work for. Your review got me laughing so hard that I forgot what I was going to write. And everything you said about what was going on with these reviews was right on the money. What&#x27;s even funnier is they just proved all your points by that flood of 5-star reviews after your post that contained everything you pointed out- all of the frantic rush of positive reviews were re-postings of previous posts, calling anyone who didn&#x27;t see results a jealous competitor and then post the dog bite review again for the 4th or 5th time? Talk about cutting off your own foot! Pleezze, at least find some new promotional material to post. By the way, does the fact that I&#x27;m now only using a cheap moisturising sunblock make me some kind of bitter competitor too?</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not one to believe the hype from people I do not know personally (as in reviewers) I am glad I did in reference to these amazing creams I purchased here at Amazon. &lt;br /&gt;I have had people actually ask me if I had Botox done because my lines have faded. &lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that these creams aren&#x27;t a permanent answer to removing the lines altogether. The creams are like daily maitenence. If u do microdermabrasion or acid peel treatments while using these creams religiously, u can achieve slowing down the signs of \\&quot;maturing\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The quest for a Botox alternative is a popular pursuit among both skin care manufacturers and consumers. While Botox is highly effective in reducing motion wrinkles, it is expensive, requires physician-administered injections, and occasionally leads to side effects, such as droopy eyelids. Not surprisingly, products touted as Botox alternatives keep popping up. Acetyl hexapeptide-3 (trade name Argireline and main ingredient in REJUVINOL) is one of the seemingly promising new Botox alternatives.     Argireline is manufactured by a Spanish company Lipotec and is a hexapeptide (a chain of 6 amino acids) attached to the acetic acid residue. It is believed to work by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters. When applied to the skin, Argireline supposedly relaxes facial tension leading to the reduction in facial lines and wrinkles with regular use. This remotely resembles the effect of Botox, which reduces facial tension and movement by paralyzing facial muscles. Note that Argireline is unrelated in its physiologic effect and mechanism of action to other bioactive skin peptides, such as palmitoyl pentapeptide.     So far, the evidence to support the benefits of Argireline is very promising. In a clinical study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science, acetyl hexapeptide-3 at a 10% concentration has been shown to reduce the depth of wrinkles up to 30% after 30 days of use and this is the amount used in the REJUVINOL formula. There are no other credible clinical studies to be found but many are being conducted. The benefits of long-term use, if any, are unknown but look good.     Is it worth a try? The rationale behind REJUVINOL is plausible enough and eventually it may be validated by research as a safe and effective wrinkle fighter. However, at this point neither its effectiveness nor safety can be considered even tentatively proven. Besides, Argireline-based products are not particularly cheap, even compared to Botox. However, I am not sure if theirprices reflect a large novelty-hype premium or high costs of the concentrated (10% or more is required) active ingredient. If it&#x27;s the former, the prices may eventually decline.     There is one more concern worth mentioning. Botox injections target specific muscles, whereas Argireline (if it indeed works) is likely to relax most of your face. And while Argireline may reduce wrinkles, it may also, in theory, increase facial sag because the neurotransmitters whose release Argireline inhibits, help maintain facial firmness. Notably, a popular firming skin care ingredient DMAE firms by stimulating the release of neurotransmitters and increasing facial tension, i.e. by producing roughly the opposite effect to Argireline. Whether Argireline may indeed contribute to facial sag has not been studied. Until further research is done it is concluded that Rejuvinol is one of the top anti-wrinkle creams on the market and should be around for years to come!</li>
    <li> I keep a month ahead stocked in my vanity area, I was first skeptical to order these because I didn&#x27;t know anyone personally that had used these creams however after reading the review I below I decided to try Rejuvinol and Rejuvox. I was considering doing a little cosmetic surgery before reading this:   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reviewer: Wanda Sykes - See all my reviews  &lt;br /&gt;What You Should Know about the Risks and Benefits of Plastic Surgery.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Topical treatments can help improve fine wrinkles and skin texture. However, rapid and dramatic improvements are more likely to be achieved with plastic surgery. But don&#x27;t rush to schedule your plastic surgery just yet. First, here are some facts you should know.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plastic surgery is expensive. In the US, a facelift costs from $6,000 to $12,000.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Any surgery is potentially dangerous, including plastic surgery. Complications are rare but they do occur, ranging from scarring to fatalities. Plastic surgery may be particularly risky if you have certain health conditions (e.g. diabetes).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different. Some people do much better than others, even when treated by the same plastic surgeon.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It may take several weeks or months before your face fully recovers from plastic surgery.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plastic surgery might adversely affect the physiology of your skin and underlying tissues, speeding up the aging process.  &lt;br /&gt;If you decide to undergo plastic surgery, keep in mind the following.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With plastic surgery, more is not necessarily better. For instance, too tight or too frequent facelifts may create a distorted, unnatural look. The result may be worse than having no plastic surgery at all.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Find a board certified surgeon with a vast experience in the plastic surgery. Search thoroughly, compare different plastic surgeons, talk to their former patients.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is somewhat more risky to have plastic surgery in a surgeon&#x27;s office than in a hospital. If you are having an in-office plastic surgery, make sure that the facility is accredited by AAAASF (The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plastic surgery does not slow down the aging of the skin but may actually accelerate it. Therefore, plastic surgery is not a substitute for skin rejuvenation measures discussed in various articles at Smart Skin Care Site. Actually, after a plastic surgery you should be even more diligent in preserving your skin&#x27;s youth.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before going for plastic surgery, give a few month try to topical skin rejuvenation treatments (see Treatments section of this site). The results may be dramatic enough to change your mind.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Ladies dont expect miracles if you&#x27;re over the age of 50. This product relaxes the fine lines on your face. It DOESN&#x27;T turn back the clock 20 years only maybe 5-10. For those of you who decided to start fighting the aging process after 50....good luck, find a reputable plastic surgeon because these products won&#x27;t perform that sort of miracle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Best wishes &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been using Rejuvinol AM/PM and Ocuderm for two weeks now. Absolutely love it. There is a noticeable change in my skin. The most dramatic change has been the skins firmness on face and neck. I lost 20 pounds and although I reached my ideal weight it did a number on my face (saggy). I am thrilled with this product and will continue to use it. When I started using the Rejuvinol AM/PM I did notice a acceleration in product results. As far as crows feet and forehead lines: They are still there but not nearly as noticeable. I want to see results several months down the road. My eyes: still have (fat deposits) but skin is much firmer. My upper lid is what thrills me most. I can see my eyelid again!!! The hooded eyelid is much firmer. Looking forward to a moisturizer in this line and Ocuderm ahs been great getting rid of this problem. Although I don&#x27;t need one in the summer months, I most likely will need it during the winter. I prefer to stay with the same product line. I better stop raving about your product. People will start thinking I work for the company. You have wonderful products!!!!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried various creams to fade the fine lines that have been developing since hitting my mid 30&#x27;s.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am happy to share my positive experience to all who care to pay attention to what I have to say: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is a little costly for something that isn&#x27;t permanent. but if u want a permanent alternative there are serious risks involved with plastic surgery which can run you thousands of dollars. As for me personally I would much rather have it the easy and painless way with Rejuvinol and Rejuvox. &lt;br /&gt;These creams used regularly relaxed the lines (typically refered to as Crows Feet) around my eyes.  It also faded the frown lines between my eyes and forehead. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t achieve some sort of immediate result is obviously using it along with other products that are countering the ingredients or are just ranting lunatics be cause these really work. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Proof is in the puddin&#x27; my lines are diminishing! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I was looking for a really good topical freezing cream or gel and these kept popping up all over the internet as a very successful duo.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I ordered them.</li>
    <li> There are NO miracle creams people however, these products are basicallly like makeu-up. They won&#x27;t help diminish the lines permanantly but when you are wearing them the top layer of skin seems to freeze therefore giving the illusion that the lines are gone, which technically they are. I personally am very happy with these products. In addition I am doing microdermabrasion monthly so while my lines are \\&quot;frozen\\&quot; while using Rejuvinol and Rejuvox, it&#x27;s is beyond a doubt that the combintion of the creams and microderm are helping them actually disappear. &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these creams.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever written a testimonial, but I just had to. I&#x27;ve used EVERYTING on the market today. I would get so excited only to be disapponted. But this wonderful product has exceeded all my expectations. When a long time friend looks at you and says, \\&quot;Your skin looks beautiful. And you have no wrinkles\\&quot;, you know the product is working. I&#x27;ve only used the Rejuvinol  for three weeks, but I&#x27;m sold. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the results. My complexion looksvery smooth and firm. Lines around my lips have significantly faded. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have found the Rejuvinol system to be excellent. I am experiencing great moisturiztion on the skin and an overall tighter and firmer complexion. I did research on the active ingredient argiriline and not surprisingly the medical information on it really good. It was quite surprising maybe you will find it helpful.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline is the name of the molecule acetyl hexapeptide-3. When applied topically, Argireline seems to have an effect similar to that of BOTOX injections on the muscles of the face. Peptides are small fragments of proteins. Proteins are the main building blocks of nearly all living tissues. Argireline, acetyl hexapeptide-3, is a chain of six amino acids that are attached to the residue of acetic acid. Topical application of Argireline is the only method of delivery that as yet has been tested.  &lt;br /&gt;Argireline relaxes facial tension, leading to the relaxation of facial muscles that contribute to lines and wrinkles. Researchers think Argireline works by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters released by the brain that tell these facial muscles to tense. The result is relaxed musculature and reduced wrinkles and lines. The Argireline&#x27;s effects are very similar to those of BOTOX injections. But where the FDA only allows BOTOX serum to be injected in limited areas of the face, Argireline may be applied wherever lines and wrinkles appear. One published study showed a 30% reduction in wrinkle size after only 30 days of using Argireline or its generic equivalent, acetyl hexapeptide-3.Yes. Argireline is one of the most exciting ingredients to come along in recent years. Argireline works on mechanical lines and tension-related wrinkles and therefore makes an excellent combination with other, more traditional, anti wrinkle ingredients that work by resurfacing and moisturizing the skin.Argireline is a favorable and promising alternative to botox injections and one that is highly recommended when found in anti aging skin care products thathave additional effective ingredients. Look for Argireline or acetyl hexapeptide-3 in the ingredients before you buy. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I got my bottles on Tuesday last ... and began using it that evening, and twice a day since then ... so 9 days, counting this morning.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, it should be realized that I have never used an \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; product before ... and I&#x27;m 54, with oil-prone skin [especially in my T-zone] that is both sensitive and prone to breakouts.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was only after I managed to get my face clear [via OCM ... thank you ladies] that I realized I had some \\&quot;catch up\\&quot; work to do in that area. So I&#x27;ve been using eye creams and Vitamin C serum since late August.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The wrinkles above my lip ... under my nose ... were fairly deep ... particularly around a scar I have from a dog bite I got about 2.5 years ago. [Long story ... very embarrassing ... Rolling Eyes ] At any rate ... I have rather deep wrinkling in that area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am, by nature, skeptical of these sorts of things ... and I was particularly skeptical that Rejubinol AM/PM would help with the lines around this scar. After all, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;normal\\&quot; wrinkling.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate \\&quot;softening\\&quot; but after two days, I was surprised to note that the \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; near the eye were almost non-existent ... and the deeper lines in that area had \\&quot;shortened\\&quot; and softened.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What was even more astonishing was that the lines near my scar [above my lip] were also softened! (Laughing)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought this was simply my imagination. After all ... you put a product onto an area and you hope/expect that it will do what it claims to do. (Laughing)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This morning, however, I looked more closely ... with my 12X magnifying mirror ... and sure enough ... fine lines have \\&quot;disappeared\\&quot; and my deeper lines have softened so much that it&#x27;s readily visible.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of the lines around the scarred area are \\&quot;gone\\&quot; ... while the deeper ones in this area have softened considerably as well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everywhere I have applied this product ... the fine lines ... gone. Deeper lines ... shorter and softer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I put this on, I don&#x27;t notice a \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; sensation so much as a \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; sensation. You do feel it working ... and now I know that it&#x27;s not just a sensation ... it&#x27;s actually working!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I now wish I&#x27;d figured out how to take my own picture \\&quot;before\\&quot; so that I could compare the photos ... but it&#x27;s not my imagination ... this stuff is truly marvellous!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank you again, for offering this wonderful product!</li>

    <li> All the positive reviews were submitted by the manufacterer and their sales people located all over the world. These sales people, through a contract, cannot be linked to the manufacterer. In my opinion, this is very unethical of them. I cannot tell you how it is that I know this. As for the product itself, it does nothing for the skin. Maybe psychologically, it makes one feel better but it has been proven to do nothing for the skin or the muscles.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled with the results of these creams.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My plastic surgeon that recommended these creams does my Botox  &lt;br /&gt;injections every 3-4 months. I maintain the results I achieve with Botox thanks to these products. They help relax the expression lines around my eyes and forehead. If only botox lasted forever!</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In a remarkable turn of events, arguably one of the strangest in the history of cosmetics, women across the country are putting a stretch-mark cream called Rejuvinol AM/PM on their face to diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and crows&#x27; feet. And, if consumer sales are any indication of a product&#x27;s effectiveness, Rejuvinol AM/PM is nothing short of a miracle. Women, as well as a growing number of \\&quot;Boomer\\&quot; men, are buying so much Rejuvinol AM/PM that finding a tube at your local cosmetic counter has become just about impossible. Has everyone gone mad? Well...not really.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scientific Breakthrough or Dumb Luck?  &lt;br /&gt;Although Rejuvinol AM/PM functional components were already backed by clinical trials documenting their ability to visibly reduce the appearance of existing stretch marks (prominent because of their depth, length, discoloration and texture)... the success of Rejuvinol AM/PM as an anti-wrinkle cream was \\&quot;dumb luck,\\&quot; says Rudy Gay, spokesperson for Dermalogics, Rejuvinol AM/PM? manufacturer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When we first handed out samples of the Rejuvinol AM/PM formula to employees and customers as part of our market research, the sample tubes were simply marked \\&quot;topical cream\\&quot; with the lot number underneath,\\&quot; Mr. Gay explains. \\&quot;As the samples were passed to friends and family, the message became a little muddled and some people used this \\&quot;topical cream\\&quot; as a facial moisturizer. As we began to receive feedback from users, like \\&quot;I look 10 years younger\\&quot; and \\&quot;I can&#x27;t even notice my crows&#x27; feet\\&quot; we knew we had something more than America&#x27;s most effective stretch-mark cream. The point was driven home as store owners began reporting that almost as many people were purchasing Rejuvinol as an anti-wrinkle cream as were buying it to reduce stretch marks.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Steven Lebowitz, PhD, Dermalogic&#x27;s Director of Scientific Affairs, says, \\&quot;Clearly, people were seeing results, but we didn&#x27;t have a scientific explanation asto why this wrinkle-reduction was occurring. However, based on the incredibly positive reports, I started using it myself applying Rejuvinol to my face after shaving.\\&quot; Dr. Lebowitz adds, \\&quot;On a personal note, my wife tells me I haven&#x27;t looked this good in years.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dumb Luck Strikes Again!  &lt;br /&gt;Then, on Tuesday, July 2, 2003, at a meeting of the 20th World Congress of Dermatology in Paris, France, a series of studies detailing the superior wrinkle-reducing properties of a patented oligo-peptide \\&quot;called Pal-KTTKS\\&quot; versus retinol, vitamin C, and placebo, on \\&quot;photo-aged skin\\&quot; was presented.1,2 \\&quot;As luck would have it,\\&quot; Dr. Lebowitz states, \\&quot;the anti-wrinkle oligo-peptide tested in the breakthrough clinical trials turned out to be a key ingredient in the Rejuvinol cream.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the trials, subjects applied the patented peptide solution to the crows&#x27; feet area on one side of the face, and a cream containing either retinol, vitamin C, or a placebo to the other side.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Subjects in the Pal-KTTKS/retinol study applied the cream once a day for 2 months and then twice a day for the next 2 months. Using special image analysis, the study&#x27;s authors reported \\&quot;significant improvement\\&quot; in both the overall appearance of skin tone and wrinkles for those women using the peptide solution.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Better yet, at the 2-month halfway point, the peptide solution worked nearly 1.5 times faster than retinol \\&quot;in measured parameters,\\&quot; and without the inflammation retinol often causes in sensitive skin. As was expected, the results of the remaining studies confirmed that the Pal-KTTKS solution&#x27;s effectiveness at reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles far exceeded both vitamin C and placebo.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A smoother, younger complexion, with less irritation and faster results-all without expensive (and painful) peels, implants or injections.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Better than Retinol and Vitamin C, But Is Rejuvinol AM/PM Better than Botox?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jennifer Cifelli, PhD, RD, Director of Women&#x27;s Health at Minneapolis based Golden Sun Systems, exclusive distributor for Dermalogics, explains, \\&quot;Leading dermatologists agree that Botox is the preferred treatment for moderate to severe frown lines between the brow. But ever since it was discovered that Rejuvinol could reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and crows&#x27; feet... the kind of fine lines, wrinkles and crows feet that can add 10-15 years to your appearance and which costly medical treatments often leave behind... skin-care professionals have been recommending, and using, Rejuvinol.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In fact, researchers believe non-invasive alternatives are better, because, Dr. Cifelli continues, \\&quot;Topical creams and gels offer gradual, continual results, while the effects of injections, facial peels, and dermabrasions are rougher on the skin and wear off.\\&quot; In other words, Rejuvinol AM/PM helps give you a youthful, healthy, glowing complexion faster than retinol, far superior to vitamin C, and without irritation, needles, or surgery. Even better, many dermatologists and plastic surgeons recommend Rejuvinol AM/PM in conjunction with cosmetic procedures, including Botox.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, if you see someone applying an anti-stretch mark cream to their face, don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve gone off the deep end... they may be smarter than you think.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a 10 star product! It really works and all you negative reviewrs know it. Your all just jealous you couldnt come up with one of your own and learn how to use the internet to take a piece of the pie. I know somebody it cured her big birth mark on one side of her face and bad burn scars all over the other side in oner week. And that&#x27;s the truth. If it don&#x27;t work for you you beyond help. If your so old your wrinkled as a prune take your shriviled lilly face to the docter and get a face lift!</li>
    <li> The previous poster has copied word-for-word information on this ingredient from another website. I cannot name it because this review will be blocked but this review has been copied repeately throughout this entire review area. It&#x27;s quite disturbing.</li>
    <li> I found the review below both interesting and informative: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The quest for a Botox alternative is a popular pursuit among both skin care manufacturers and consumers. While Botox is highly effective in reducing motion wrinkles, it is expensive, requires physician-administered injections, and occasionally leads to side effects, such as droopy eyelids. Not surprisingly, products touted as Botox alternatives keep popping up. Acetyl hexapeptide-3 (trade name Argireline and main ingredient in REJUVINOL) is one of the seemingly promising new Botox alternatives.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline is manufactured by a Spanish company Lipotec and is a hexapeptide (a chain of 6 amino acids) attached to the acetic acid residue. It is believed to work by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters. When applied to the skin, Argireline supposedly relaxes facial tension leading to the reduction in facial lines and wrinkles with regular use. This remotely resembles the effect of Botox, which reduces facial tension and movement by paralyzing facial muscles. Note that Argireline is unrelated in its physiologic effect and mechanism of action to other bioactive skin peptides, such as palmitoyl pentapeptide.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So far, the evidence to support the benefits of Argireline is very promising. In a clinical study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science, acetyl hexapeptide-3 at a 10% concentration has been shown to reduce the depth of wrinkles up to 30% after 30 days of use and this is the amount used in the REJUVINOL formula. There are no other credible clinical studies to be found but many are being conducted. The benefits of long-term use, if any, are unknown but look good.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is it worth a try? The rationale behind REJUVINOL is plausible enough and eventually it may be validated by research as a safe and effective wrinkle fighter. However, at this point neither its effectiveness nor safety can be considered even tentatively proven. Besides, Argireline-based products are not particularly cheap, even compared to Botox. However, I am not sure if their prices reflect a large novelty-hype premium or high costs of the concentrated (10% or more is required) active ingredient. If it&#x27;s the former, the prices may eventually decline.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is one more concern worth mentioning. Botox injections target specific muscles, whereas Argireline (if it indeed works) is likely to relax most of your face. And while Argireline may reduce wrinkles, it may also, in theory, increase facial sag because the neurotransmitters whose release Argireline inhibits, help maintain facial firmness. Notably, a popular firming skin care ingredient DMAE firms by stimulating the release of neurotransmitters and increasing facial tension, i.e. by producing roughly the opposite effect to Argireline. Whether Argireline may indeed contribute to facial sag has not been studied. Until further research is done it is concluded that Rejuvinol is one of the top anti-wrinkle creams on the market and should be around for years to come!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am amazed with the quality and consistency of these fine products. I have recommended these products to lots of people and I haven&#x27;t heard one negative complaint once. &lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work Amazon with providing us with quality beauty creams! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the past ten years I have had a problem with flaking near my nose and on my forehead. I have tried many different types of exfoliants to cleanse these areas. The result has always been the same. After application and drying, these area turn \\&quot;beat\\&quot; red....to the extent that I cannot leave the house. Instead of exfoliants, I have been using soap and water, then drying and applying a very liberal amount of moisturizer. However, no matter how little moisturizer I apply, within hours a slight crusting appears again.  &lt;br /&gt;Your Rejuvinol AM/PM product is amazing. Not only does it not leave me \\&quot;red\\&quot;....but it is self moisturizing without residue. My skin is smooth to the touch....problem solved. I also love the nighttime cream cause i wake up feelin nice and soft.  &lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the product.....it really works.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have very slight wrinkling on the corners of my eyes and just very mild creasing on the forehead. I have never spent over $10 for a face cream in my life. After seeing all the overjoyed customers writing on websites, I bought the creams. I can&#x27;t believe I did it because I tend to be cynical about miracle cures for anything. I used it for six weeks religuously morning and night. For that kind of money I would have expected some kind of difference. Even an iota of difference. It did nothing. I am only grateful my husband doesn&#x27;t know I spent that kind of money for nothing. They also must not have a sunscreen because my skin burned easily in the sun. Normally I never burn. If an antiaging product has no sunscreen isn&#x27;t it defeating its own purpose? &lt;br /&gt;After reading these comments, now I understand why it had no effect. I think the most bestt thought-out review was the one below. I would also add to his or her suggestions to add a sunscreen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Best review: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Reese Hurley: &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I think the reviewer who suggested using the search option \\&quot;most helpful reviews\\&quot; gave some very good advice. These reviews tell a story other than the 4-star rating this product indicates. Unfortunately, this is not the only seller on Amazon using customer reviews to increase their own rating. This seller is just more blatant &amp; rude than most (see review below and several others).Amazon has a disclaimer on what is written in these reviews and is not responsible. However, I do believe it will have an indirect impact on their own reputation, as negative blog sites regarding Amazon are beginning to appear.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To the manufacturer: (which I assume is the Bodestore, because there is no information regarding a company called Dermalogics using any search engine. If the Bodestore would like to correct this, please do so. You have that option).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would like to offer you some friendly advice:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The concensus withthe negative reviews (myself included--it had no effect for me) seems to include some or all of the following:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. The product does not contain enough moisturizer  &lt;br /&gt;2. The product has no effect &amp; does not live up to its claims  &lt;br /&gt;3. An exhorbitant return fee (indicating no faith in your own product)  &lt;br /&gt;4. Customers are turned off by the wordy, clincial-sounding reviews posted repeatedly and also the insulting nature of many of your responses.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suggest that if you would direct your efforts into improving the product itself, conducting yourself in a more professional manner, and providing more clinical evidence than one small study; you will be much more effective in building a successful business. Buying up 100 domain sites will only work in the short-term. Your negative methods so far make you appear (I&#x27;m sorry to say)like a fly-by-night operation, inexperienced and rude. This unfortunately has a more global effect on other more reputable internet marketers. Companies like yours are the reason people are skeptical of buying any products off the internet and we are all hurt by it. Thank you.\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also notice that something like 12 raving reviews were posted immedietely after his/her post. Some had already been posted before. I don&#x27;t buy a word of any of them and I hope nobody else does.    &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Rejuvanol has really made quite a noticable difference on my face.  I have been using it for about 4 weeks and the lines around my mouth and eyes and they have lessened considerably. I do like this product! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Rejuvinol and Rejuvox work better than Botox. Now I&#x27;m able to see a big difference in my whole complexion, not only just around my eyes and forehead. Not as expensive and without the use of painful needles!</li>
    <li> I really do like this product my first shipment the product jar was damaged. I liked it enough to continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I never was into anti-aging stuff till my late 20&#x27;s then I tried everything I could get my hands on...every procedure for my age range from microdermabrasion to BOTOX. Yes, call me a beauty-psycho or whatever I just want continue to look young while I still can. Obviously the reason for even bothering to write this is because I whole-heartedly believe in these 2 creams. I have seen such dramatic results. The fine lines around my eyes (crows feet?) have softened and the frown lines between my eyebrows are still there but much less noticeable. Rejuvinol and Rejuvox will always be in my bathroom cabinet for life!!!</li>
    <li> First time purchasing from AMAZON and the whole experience went well. Was always a little bit leery about purchasing online but I finally gave in. I purchased Rejuvinol on 10/17 and I have been  impressed by the results. Product applies light and smooth and smells great. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviews I had dry skin effect. My skin felt very tightening after using it and did not have its normal moist appearance. I had to use a moisturizer over top. I tried to write the company to ask if an extra moisturizer is supposed to be used with the product, but I receive no answer after three times emailed. I have not seen any improve in little lines after five weeks but maybe it takes longer time?</li>
    <li> I was excited to buy this product because I have premature wrinkling from working outdoors and thought I&#x27;d try a change from Strivectin. I got the same effects other reviewers described. A parchment look and feel to my face that was NOT flattering. I thought there must be something wrong with ME because of all the positive reviews. Then I did a little research and discovered the manufacturer had received an FDA warning for another of their products for misleading information and incorrect labeling. I think they better take a look at this product too   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have seen a complete change in my overall complexion :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been complimented like never before. At first it seemed as though my face was tightening and felt like it needed more moisture but I confused it with the fact that it contains the product argiriline which makes your face sort of freeze- causing lines to diminish....so for those of you that are as concerned as I was...do a little research before you spend your life savings.</li>
    <li> I gave a bottle of Rejuvinol AM/PM to my mother who is currently using it in combintation with a vitamin C serum. She has been using Rejuvinol AM/PM for the past three weeks or so and is also using the Ocuderm that is sold by Dermalogics. In the three weeks there has been a visible improvement in the vertical frown lines between her brows and also some of the horizontal lines on her forehead. While these lines are certainly not gone, they do look much better. This is particularly so for the lines between her brows which were quite deep to begin with. She has also commented that the texture of her skin (particularly her neck) has also improved. I know she (and I) have tried other products before but have been let down by all their hype. We have struggled to find a good quality cream that lives up to its reputation...well i think we finally found a winner in Rejuvinol</li>
    <li> I have found the Rejuvinol system to be excellent. I am experiencing great moisturiztion on the skin and an overall tighter and firmer complexion. I did research on the active ingredient argiriline and not surprisingly the medical information on it really good. It was quite surprising maybe you will find it helpful.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline is the name of the molecule acetyl hexapeptide-3. When applied topically, Argireline seems to have an effect similar to that of BOTOX injections on the muscles of the face. Peptides are small fragments of proteins. Proteins are the main building blocks of nearly all living tissues. Argireline, acetyl hexapeptide-3, is a chain of six amino acids that are attached to the residue of acetic acid. Topical application of Argireline is the only method of delivery that as yet has been tested.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline relaxes facial tension, leading to the relaxation of facial muscles that contribute to lines and wrinkles. Researchers think Argireline works by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters released by the brain that tell these facial muscles to tense. The result is relaxed musculature and reduced wrinkles and lines. The Argireline&#x27;s effects are very similar to those of BOTOX injections. But where the FDA only allows BOTOX serum to be injected in limited areas of the face, Argireline may be applied wherever lines and wrinkles appear. One published study showed a 30% reduction in wrinkle size after only 30 days of using Argireline or its generic equivalent, acetyl hexapeptide-3.Yes. Argireline is one of the most exciting ingredients to come along in recent years. Argireline works on mechanical lines and tension-related wrinkles and therefore makes an excellent combination with other, more traditional, anti wrinkle ingredients that work by resurfacing and moisturizing the skin.Argireline is a favorable and promising alternative to botox injections and one that is highly recommended when found in anti aging skin care productsthat have additional effective ingredients. Look for Argireline or acetyl hexapeptide-3 in the ingredients before you buy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m appalled by all the mumble jumble given out by lady from Minnesota, and I believe she is actually a man underneath everything (Dr. Suckme and I actually doubt she&#x27;s a doctor other than a doctor of a bunch of mumble-jumble) and it&#x27;s my understanding that it&#x27;s against Ebay&#x27;s policy for the customer to endorse a product that she has never used before. Only a down and out person would go into such boring detail of their hatred and boring life and its very sad really because it&#x27;s just non-stop. I did my research (after listening to this redundant lady for the product that works as well as gold) and the person who wrote the product works amazing...is RIGHT! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;[...] &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Please, the person that does not buy Rejuvinol and and those other names they go under, quit writing up your own boring reviews. It does nothing for your image, in fact, it does the quite opposite. I know of a lot of people who asked me \\&quot;why would such a loser spend so much time fighting a losing battle\\&quot;...and the only answer is that she lost a long time ago. Long live the state of Minnesota and live Jesse Ventura in our hearts forever! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> U da man, Kamau! Keep sellin that white cracker cream!! Black oil for the homies &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Let&#x27;s go we hit the hood slow &lt;br /&gt;Post up, set up shop and press four &lt;br /&gt;Who got the best flow, who got the most dough\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> For the past ten years I have had a problem with flaking near my nose and on my forehead. I have tried many different types of exfoliants to cleanse these areas. The result has always been the same. After application and drying, these area turn \\&quot;beat\\&quot; red....to the extent that I cannot leave the house. Instead of exfoliants, I have been using soap and water, then drying and applying a very liberal amount of moisturizer. However, no matter how little moisturizer I apply, within hours a slight crusting appears again.  &lt;br /&gt;Your Rejuvinol AM/PM product is amazing. Not only does it not leave me \\&quot;red\\&quot;....but it is self moisturizing without residue. My skin is smooth to the touch....problem solved. I also love the nighttime cream cause i wake up feelin nice and soft.  &lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the product.....it really works.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;My first mistake was believing all the outrageous claims about this product. My second mistake was never doing any research on the ingredients. My third mistake was just looking at the overall rating and only reading a couple reviews on this site before trying this product. After 2 months of diligently using it day and night, I was left with the same wrinkles plus a few new ones, a dry face, and $100 deeper in debt. I thought am I some kind of mutant? How can I be the only one that didn&#x27;t see any results?? I&#x27;m not 70 yrs old and wrinkled up like some shriveled hot dog and beyond help! I&#x27;m 38 and live healthily so I just have some minor wrinkles by my eyes! Laughing here.  &lt;br /&gt;Then I did an investigation on the ingredients after the fact. Or tried to anyhow. So far I&#x27;ve found only one small independent study on one of the most promoted ingredients. I found reviews from here reposted on several other sites. I finally read all the reviews on here in its entirity. The more I read the madder I got but in the end it turned out to be such a comedy I could only laugh. The same ong, wordy \\&quot;scientific\\&quot; reviews posted a half dozen times under different names, bad reviews altered slightly to become positive reviews using the negative reviewer&#x27;s same name, an identical dog bite tale posted by 3 different people from all over the country, weird blank spaces included in good reviews,,, for what? Hoping people don&#x27;t have the patience to read beyond and see the negative comments? LOL! Then there&#x27;s the wording. How many times can gushing reviews repeatedly spell the word \\&quot;definitely\\&quot; wrong the same way? It is not spelled \\&quot;definately\\&quot;!! Or how many times does a person have to read \\&quot;will always include in my skin care regime\\&quot;? Or \\&quot;It was recommended by a friend, coworker, my poodle, etc ecc? And when has anyone seen positive review customers attacking unhappy customers on any other customer review site?? My favorite is Doctor Harvey from Minnesota who says there&#x27;s been some talk of argirline causing facial sagging but until anybody proves it, just keep slathering it on!  &lt;br /&gt;OMG, this product, claims and reviews could be used in a Marketing 101 class in how NOT to market a product. OR an SNL comedy skit. &lt;br /&gt;Thank God I have the ability to laugh at myself or I&#x27;d feel like the most gullible and disgruntled woman in the world. Besides, all the laughs were almost worth the $100. :))) &lt;br /&gt;P.S. To the 3 different people with the identical dog bite story: You never mentioned what kind of dog you all shared? And did you consider a rabies check on the dog before applying this dog bite cure cream? :) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First of all I would like to put it out there that these are absolutely magnificent products and this is from a REAL REVIEWER of these creams.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried countless products to alleviate the fine lines (crow&#x27;s feet) I inherited from my father&#x27;s side of the family.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BY THE WAY........This is my FOURTH order placed.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been TREMENDOUSLY happy with the results. I am happy I took the chance on a product that I had never heard of before. No it doesn&#x27;t eliminate lines...nothing does except maybe a faclift however it DEFINATELY DOES \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; the top layer of skin therefore \\&quot;DIMINISHING\\&quot; the appearance... &lt;br /&gt;This stuff isn&#x27;t really that expensive compared to SEPHORA this is worth the price so if money is the problem, stay with the products you CAN afford. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m half way through a bottle of this so I thought it might be time to jot down some thoughts about this serum. I&#x27;m sure many of you know that my fave serum thus far has been the Vivier serum. I&#x27;m pretty sure you know this because you must be sick and tired of me butting in with posts about the Vivier when other people ask for opinions on vit C serums (sorry!) Bad Grin  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Cellex-C, the Skinceuticals, the CellularSkinRx the Vivier (for me) was the best in terms of texture. I have normal skin (sometimes combo) and found the first two felt drying while the CSRx felt a bit too oily. The Vivier was the best choice between those extremes. While I had an open mind, I was pretty sure that the Rejuvinol AM/PM would not win over the Vivier. Ok, that statement seems contradictory - guess I didn&#x27;t have an open mind after all Laughing  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, it turns out that there is something with even better texture (for my skin) than the Vivier - namely the Rejuvinol AM/PM (yeah, I&#x27;m as surprised as you are that I am making this statement!). This, texture wise, sits in between the Cellex-C/SC and the Vivier. It has less slip than the Vivier - it feels absolutely \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. You pat it in, it absorbs straight away, your skin feels like there is absolutely nothing on it. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel tight (had that with the straight Cellex-C and the SC serums), it doesn&#x27;t feel somewhat oily (had that with the CSRx), it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s been a bit moisturised (had that with the Vivier). It just feels like you&#x27;ve applied nothing. Anyway, you get the point - me impressed with texture Rolling Eyes Laughing  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before using the Rejuvinol (which I believe is 10% but comprised of 5% each of two different types of vit) I was actually using the 20% Vivier serum. Is the Rejuvinol just as good in the lower concentration? Well, that is very hard to say. I think that the Vivier 20% might have actually been a tad more effective but I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s very difficult to compare things like that. The Rejuvinol, so far, appears to be quite stable. It had a very slight marshmellow tinge to it when I started using it and still looks the same (IMO). I will update on this when I finish the bottle.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which one would I buy in the future? The Rejuvinol is half the size of the Vivier which makes it significantly more expensive. I would like to try the Vivier again and see what I think (luckily I have a sample of the Vivier to compare with Smile). If I really can&#x27;t see the difference between the two then my personal preference based on texture will be to get the Rejuvinol, if my wallet is doing the choosing then it&#x27;ll be the Vivier. If they were around the same price I would be going for the Rejuvinol no doubt.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, a little note about why I spend so much time c**pping on about the texture. Some people may agree and some people may disagree with this, but from my experience with vit serums I now believe that your skin type should largely decide which serum you should buy (assume they are all equally effective). If I had oily skin I&#x27;d be going with the Cellex-C or the Skinceuticals (unless I wanted to use the B5 gel over the top in which case both would be fine for drier skins anyway). If I had very dry skin I would go with the CellularSkinRx one. If I had dry skin it would be the Vivier. If I had normal to combo skin (well, I DO have normal to combo skin!) then I&#x27;d go with the Rejuvinol. Keep in mind, this is just MY preference based on MY experiences with these products. I know that there are people with oilier skins that use the CSRx and like it so I am certainly not saying that this is wrong. Everyone has tehir own skin and will have their own experiences so choose which is best for you. The Rejuvinol for me happens to be the best and I will spare no expense to make my skin look healthy and young!  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got my creams on Tuesday last ... and began using them that evening, and twice a day since then ... so 9 days, counting this morning.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, it should be realized that I have never used an \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; product before ... and I&#x27;m 54, with oil-prone skin [especially in my T-zone] that is both sensitive and prone to breakouts.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was only after I managed to get my face clear [via OCM ... thank you ladies] that I realized I had some \\&quot;catch up\\&quot; work to do in that area. So I&#x27;ve been using eye creams and Vitamin C serum since late August.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The wrinkles above my lip ... under my nose ... were fairly deep ... particularly around a scar I have from a dog bite I got about 2.5 years ago. [Long story ... very embarrassing ... Rolling Eyes ] At any rate ... I have rather deep wrinkling in that area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am, by nature, skeptical of these sorts of things ... and I was particularly skeptical that Rejubinol AM/PM would help with the lines around this scar. After all, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;normal\\&quot; wrinkling.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate \\&quot;softening\\&quot; but after two days, I was surprised to note that the \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; near the eye were almost non-existent ... and the deeper lines in that area had \\&quot;shortened\\&quot; and softened.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What was even more astonishing was that the lines near my scar [above my lip] were also softened! (Laughing)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought this was simply my imagination. After all ... you put a product onto an area and you hope/expect that it will do what it claims to do. (Laughing)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This morning, however, I looked more closely ... with my 12X magnifying mirror ... and sure enough ... fine lines have \\&quot;disappeared\\&quot; and my deeper lines have softened so much that it&#x27;s readily visible.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of the lines around the scarred area are \\&quot;gone\\&quot; ... while the deeper ones in this area have softened considerably as well.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere I have applied this product ... the fine lines ... gone. Deeper lines ... shorter and softer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I put this on, I don&#x27;t notice a \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; sensation so much as a \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; sensation. You do feel it working ... and now I know that it&#x27;s not just a sensation ... it&#x27;s actually working!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I now wish I&#x27;d figured out how to take my own picture \\&quot;before\\&quot; so that I could compare the photos ... but it&#x27;s not my imagination ... this stuff is truly marvellous!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank you again, for offering this wonderful product!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The quest for a Botox alternative is a popular pursuit among both skin care manufacturers and consumers. While Botox is highly effective in reducing motion wrinkles, it is expensive, requires physician-administered injections, and occasionally leads to side effects, such as droopy eyelids. Not surprisingly, products touted as Botox alternatives keep popping up. Acetyl hexapeptide-3 (trade name Argireline and main ingredient in REJUVINOL) is one of the seemingly promising new Botox alternatives.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline is manufactured by a Spanish company Lipotec and is a hexapeptide (a chain of 6 amino acids) attached to the acetic acid residue. It is believed to work by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters. When applied to the skin, Argireline supposedly relaxes facial tension leading to the reduction in facial lines and wrinkles with regular use. This remotely resembles the effect of Botox, which reduces facial tension and movement by paralyzing facial muscles. Note that Argireline is unrelated in its physiologic effect and mechanism of action to other bioactive skin peptides, such as palmitoyl pentapeptide.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So far, the evidence to support the benefits of Argireline is very promising. In a clinical study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science, acetyl hexapeptide-3 at a 10% concentration has been shown to reduce the depth of wrinkles up to 30% after 30 days of use and this is the amount used in the REJUVINOL formula. There are no other credible clinical studies to be found but many are being conducted. The benefits of long-term use, if any, are unknown but look good.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is it worth a try? The rationale behind REJUVINOL is plausible enough and eventually it may be validated by research as a safe and effective wrinkle fighter. However, at this point neither its effectiveness nor safety can be considered even tentatively proven. Besides, Argireline-based products are not particularly cheap, even compared to Botox. However, I am not sure if their prices reflect a large novelty-hype premium or high costs of the concentrated (10% or more is required) active ingredient. If it&#x27;s the former, the prices may eventually decline.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is one more concern worth mentioning. Botox injections target specific muscles, whereas Argireline (if it indeed works) is likely to relax most of your face. And while Argireline may reduce wrinkles, it may also, in theory, increase facial sag because the neurotransmitters whose release Argireline inhibits, help maintain facial firmness. Notably, a popular firming skin care ingredient DMAE firms by stimulating the release of neurotransmitters and increasing facial tension, i.e. by producing roughly the opposite effect to Argireline. Whether Argireline may indeed contribute to facial sag has not been studied. Until further research is done it is concluded that Rejuvinol is one of the top anti-wrinkle creams on the market and should be around for years to come! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Rejuvinol and Rejuvox were highly recommended to me by my dermatologiest. The results were immediate and I am very happy to share my experience with these wonderful wrinkle creams. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with these products. I&#x27;ll continue to use and recommend them to all my friends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> These creams really do work as long as you consistently use them regularly. There was a 4 week period that I didn&#x27;t use them and my wrinkles were obvious again. That&#x27;s only because of these marvelous creams not being applied on my aging face. Nothing on earth will make you permanently younger looking except maybe a face lift but then there is always a chance you might not turn out natural looking.  &lt;br /&gt;Over all these creams really work well....but be consistent.</li>

    <li> I highly recommend these for the 26-34 year age group because that is the age bracket where you start really seeing lines on your face and are young enough to start preventing them from getting worse.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The younger you start a healthy skin practice the more youthful you&#x27;ll appear to people when u hit your 30&#x27;s.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am 35 and are always mistaken for 25-26 it&#x27;s a huge compliment. It&#x27;s not like I am fighting aging, I just want to look as young as I feel. I do watch my diet and exercise regularly to maintain an overall youthful image. I am very thankful to the makers of these wonderful products. They are right up there in my book! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I just had to write and tell you what a fantastic product you have in Rejuvinol AM/PM! I&#x27;m a 45-year-old man who suffered with severe acne in my teens and 20s. Back in those days, dermatologists didn&#x27;t have nearly the arsenal of medications to prescribe as they do now, so needless to say, I was left with moderate to heavy scarring on my cheeks, on and around my nose, and behind my ears. I&#x27;ve tried many skin products over the years, but really felt nothing short of actual dermabrasion or chemical peeling would help--that is, until I found your product! I use it once or twice a week, takes just a couple of minutes, and the results have been very impressive. The depth of my scars has been reduced, their color more closely matches that of the surrounding undamaged skin, and my skin is visibly smoother. My only regret is that you didn&#x27;t come up with this stuff 20 years ago! Again, thank you very much for a product that actually does MORE than you claim!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The only drawback is that when u don&#x27;t use them the results go away :(  &lt;br /&gt;So basically it&#x27;s like make-up but I can live with that instead of costly surgery or botox!</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rejuvanol has really made quite a noticable difference on my face. I have been using it for about 4 weeks and the lines around my mouth and eyes and they have lessened considerably. I do like this product &lt;br /&gt;Deep lines are much less noticable and surface lines have all but disappeared. It comes in an AM and PM formula and applies very nicely. Fragrance is like a fresh tangerine.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these creams. They do exactly as they described. Fine lines on my forehead and crows feet around my eyes have somewhat dimisnished. These work as long as you are consistant with them...So stay stocked up on them!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with these day and night creams. I experienced immediate results with the fading of lines around my eyes. I will continue to purchase these through my trusted source, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just bought my third package of Rejuvinol and Rejuvox. When my husband and I cam to the US last year and I started my new job there was a lot of stress and after some time I saw the results of my new lifestile, since I gained lines and wrinkles. I am 34 and have been using Olaz products for years before and was always satisfied with those, but obviously at that point they were not strong enough to keep me from aging. I tried this product base on a web search during which I was looking for another product I had read about. Since, I am using it and over the time my lines definitely became less. Also, after some time my husband told me that my wrinkles and lines became almost invisible. The cream does not make you look like 20,and that was not what I expected. It however definitely stopped my wrinkles and I can recommend it without a doubt.</li>
    <li> this combo cream set was great for my fine wrinkles and skin texture. I could literally feel my complexion get better each time i used the creams. I am so glad these had a nice soft smell and were not overbearing like the others.</li>
    <li> August 17 2005  This product has been overhyped.  In fact, if you click on one of the rave reviews for this product, then click &#x27;view all reviews&#x27;, you will see that in some cases the reviews for some products are almost identical.  This made me wonder if people are being paid to write up rave reviews for several products.    In my case, after 2 weeks of use, I have seen no difference in my wrinkles, and I had an horrendous breakout, the worst I have ever experienced.  Since then, I have done futher research on this product, but all I can find are links that market the product, ie no &#x27;real&#x27; feedback from users.  I&#x27;m afraid I have been ripped off, and will be returning the product.    If you like the sound of this product, try to find independent reviews. So far I haven&#x27;t found any.    UPDATE ON 08 SEPT 2005    I gave my skin a break for about a week in case it was just a matter of getting used to the product, then tried again. After 3 days I had another severe breakout, all along my jawline (where I have never had spots before) and on both cheeks.  I&#x27;m talking 12 large acne spots and a lot of bumpy, pimply skin surrounding the acne.  In addition to the acne, I have seen absolutely no difference to my wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead (frown lines), so all I can say is, beware the over-zealous rave reviews.     I have wrapped up the parcel and returned it today, although unfortunately I don&#x27;t think I will get a refund as I am just 2 days past the 30 day deadline.  Please, if you are interested in this product, insist on a sample first. It&#x27;s a lot of money to throw away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for one month now (day and night) and I don&#x27;t see a big improvement. Also, it seems that I&#x27;m getting new fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth. From what I can see, the effects are temporary, your face is smoother for a few hours and then the effects wear out. I will continue using it for a couple of  weeks and if there are no drastic improvements, I will simply stop using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rejuvinol for the past 3 weeks and there has been a visible improvement in the frown lines between my eyes and on my forehead. Also the the texture of my skin has really gotten smoother. I would have given it a fifth star but I never received a tracking number with my confirmation email when I first placed the order. The seller could improve in this area of their business.</li>
    <li> This was an expensive disappointment!  It seems that these creams (almost identical to eachother..the am/pm is a marketing hype) only refresh and tighten the skin when you first put them on.  They absolutely do not moisturize!  I have oily skin and these creams made my makeup crack due to dryness and this only accentuated the wrinkles.  I kept thinking that I just needed to keep using them to see results.  After 30 days I gave up and stopped using.  Save your money, or better yet, go to a dermatologist and invest in real anti-aging products.</li>
    <li> Very happy and thoroughly satisfied with these products. I was recommended these by my dermatologiest who I totally trust with any skin care advice.  &lt;br /&gt;I get microdermabrasion to help fade (erase) the frown lines on my forehead and crow feet lines around my eyes. This skin care routine I have going has made my skin look years younger...and being that I just recently divorced, it a definate confidence boost. So I totally prefer Rejuvinol and Rejuvox over Botox. The price difference itself is a no-brainer because you achieve the same results!</li>
    <li> These moisterizers are very over drying and has the opposite affect of the what is claimed on the labels. I have 3 more sets of this and am concerned about returning it because they were not sealed when I received them. I have a feeling the distributor is going to say that I opened them and that they are going to charge me a 20% or 25% restocking fee.</li>
    <li> These moisterizers work phenomenally and have the positive affect of the what is claimed on the labels. I have 3 more sets of this and have no concerns about returning them because they work remarkably. I have a feeling the distributor is going to have tremendous success with these products!</li>
    <li> These creams worked wonders for my skin. I will continue to use these as a part of my daily beauy routine.</li>
    <li> As a satisfied customer, I must say that you may have one of the best and fastest shipping services on the internet. Any product I order from you--be it diet products, skin creams, lubricants, or woman&#x27;s products--I receive it within a couple of days, wonderfully packaged. I am always satisfied with every product, as well as your occasional discounts. Your search method is extremely helpful, and your product listing is unbelievably extensive. Keep up the good work! I am feeling so good these days and thnk you for it. I really dont understand the one person who keeps trying to talk bad about this product because Rejuvinol is great. I have recommended this to many friends who all love it. I would spend $500 on this cream because its worth it!!</li>
    <li> Plastic Surgery Facts   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What You Should Know about the Risks and Benefits of Plastic Surgery.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Topical treatments can help improve fine wrinkles and skin texture. However, rapid and dramatic improvements are more likely to be achieved with plastic surgery. But don&#x27;t rush to schedule your plastic surgery just yet. First, here are some facts you should know.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plastic surgery is expensive. In the US, a facelift costs from $6,000 to $12,000.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Any surgery is potentially dangerous, including plastic surgery. Complications are rare but they do occur, ranging from scarring to fatalities. Plastic surgery may be particularly risky if you have certain health conditions (e.g. diabetes).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different. Some people do much better than others, even when treated by the same plastic surgeon.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It may take several weeks or months before your face fully recovers from plastic surgery.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plastic surgery might adversely affect the physiology of your skin and underlying tissues, speeding up the aging process.  &lt;br /&gt;If you decide to undergo plastic surgery, keep in mind the following. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With plastic surgery, more is not necessarily better. For instance, too tight or too frequent facelifts may create a distorted, unnatural look. The result may be worse than having no plastic surgery at all.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Find a board certified surgeon with a vast experience in the plastic surgery. Search thoroughly, compare different plastic surgeons, talk to their former patients.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is somewhat more risky to have plastic surgery in a surgeon&#x27;s office than in a hospital. If you are having an in-office plastic surgery, make sure that the facility is accredited by AAAASF (The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plastic surgery does not slow down the aging of the skin but may actually accelerateit. Therefore, plastic surgery is not a substitute for skin rejuvenation measures discussed in various articles at Smart Skin Care Site. Actually, after a plastic surgery you should be even more diligent in preserving your skin&#x27;s youth.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before going for plastic surgery, give a few month try to topical skin rejuvenation treatments (see Treatments section of this site). The results may be dramatic enough to change your mind.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have been using the Rejuvinol cream for over 3 weeks now and i really like how my skin has responded. The lines around my eyes have dimished somewhat and my skin seems very supple and moist again. I didnt really have any crows feet but i did have some slight lines on my eyebrows which seem lighter too. The Rejuvinol was also very easy to apply and i did like the way it dried quick and with no scent. Someone said somewhere that it was a \\&quot;thin, watery\\&quot; cream but its not. The creams are thick and smooth. Very good! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews here, I ordered the Rejuvinol AM/PM fcial creams. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the adage \\&quot;Your skin will get worse before it gets better\\&quot; &#x27;cuz \\&quot;Who needs that?\\&quot; That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m always in search of the skincare regime that will completely convert me and never make me troll the boards again!! lol  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am 49 and I have to say in just one evening, my skin looked firmer, perkier and just all-around more healthy. Needless to say, I was excited to embark on day 2 of the regime. I liked the product even better the second day (I usually prefer gels, but I love the scent and feel of the Rejuvinol). And, no irritation...just younger looking, perkier (for lack of a better word) skin. On Day 3, stubborn scar from one obnoxious hormonal breakout is actually disappearing. I can&#x27;t believe it! This has been the most stubborn $#%%% in my whole life!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On Day 4, I go shopping and I buy 3 things because when I look in the mirror...my skin looks good!! This is usually so not the case! So, now Dermalogics has cost me even more money.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On Day 5, that&#x27;s it...I gotta go mortgage the house and go for the full system. And this is from a woman who has literally tried everything!! I have to admit...I really enjoy trying new products..so its my own fault. But, the train stops here. No kidding. These products gave me the fastest, best results of any product that I have ever used. I will usually try to shop around for savings but when it comes to my face and skin I have realized that i have wasted so much money on cheaper products that jsut dont work wo why not order the top of the line produycts that have proven results!?!?! Im sold......:) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half way through a bottle of this so I thought it might be time to jot down some thoughts about this serum. I&#x27;m sure many of you know that my fave serum thus far has been the Vivier serum. I&#x27;m pretty sure you know this because you must be sick and tired of me butting in with posts about the Vivier when other people ask for opinions on vit C serums (sorry!) Bad Grin  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Cellex-C, the Skinceuticals, the CellularSkinRx the Vivier (for me) was the best in terms of texture. I have normal skin (sometimes combo) and found the first two felt drying while the CSRx felt a bit too oily. The Vivier was the best choice between those extremes. While I had an open mind, I was pretty sure that the Rejuvinol AM/PM would not win over the Vivier. Ok, that statement seems contradictory - guess I didn&#x27;t have an open mind after all Laughing  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, it turns out that there is something with even better texture (for my skin) than the Vivier - namely the Rejuvinol AM/PM (yeah, I&#x27;m as surprised as you are that I am making this statement!). This, texture wise, sits in between the Cellex-C/SC and the Vivier. It has less slip than the Vivier - it feels absolutely \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. You pat it in, it absorbs straight away, your skin feels like there is absolutely nothing on it. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel tight (had that with the straight Cellex-C and the SC serums), it doesn&#x27;t feel somewhat oily (had that with the CSRx), it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s been a bit moisturised (had that with the Vivier). It just feels like you&#x27;ve applied nothing. Anyway, you get the point - me impressed with texture Rolling Eyes Laughing  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before using the Rejuvinol (which I believe is 10% but comprised of 5% each of two different types of vit) I was actually using the 20% Vivier serum. Is the Rejuvinol just as good in the lower concentration? Well, that is very hard to say. I think that the Vivier 20% might have actually been a tad more effective but I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s very difficult to compare things like that. The Rejuvinol, so far, appears to be quite stable. It had a very slight marshmellow tinge to it when I started using it and still looks the same (IMO). I will update on this when I finish the bottle.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which one would I buy in the future? The Rejuvinol is half the size of the Vivier which makes it significantly more expensive. I would like to try the Vivier again and see what I think (luckily I have a sample of the Vivier to compare with Smile). If I really can&#x27;t see the difference between the two then my personal preference based on texture will be to get the Rejuvinol, if my wallet is doing the choosing then it&#x27;ll be the Vivier. If they were around the same price I would be going for the Rejuvinol no doubt.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, a little note about why I spend so much time c**pping on about the texture. Some people may agree and some people may disagree with this, but from my experience with vit serums I now believe that your skin type should largely decide which serum you should buy (assume they are all equally effective). If I had oily skin I&#x27;d be going with the Cellex-C or the Skinceuticals (unless I wanted to use the B5 gel over the top in which case both would be fine for drier skins anyway). If I had very dry skin I would go with the CellularSkinRx one. If I had dry skin it would be the Vivier. If I had normal to combo skin (well, I DO have normal to combo skin!) then I&#x27;d go with the Rejuvinol. Keep in mind, this is just MY preference based on MY experiences with these products. I know that there are people with oilier skins that use the CSRx and like it so I am certainly not saying that this is wrong. Everyone has tehir own skin and will have their own experiences so choose which is best for you. The Rejuvinol for me happens to be the best and I will spare no expense to make my skin look healthy and young! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> These creams have by far been the best wrinkle prevention product I have found on the market...EVER. I consider myself to be a fairly high maintenance type of woman...but within a conservative budget.  These 2 creams certainly beat taking a painful needle full of Botox to the face!</li>
    <li> i have tried so many of these so called \\&quot;Anti-aging\\&quot; creams before and spent alot of money to avoid the cosmetic end of it. i heard from my beautician about these new Rejuvinol creams they were selling and so i decided to give them a try. I was impressed within the first week as my skin seems to take really well to the AM and PM formulas. I liked the idea of having two different creams because i always felt my face had different needs in the morning and the night. Rejuvinol seemed to address that. I think my lines ahve diminished a little and m yskin definatley feels very moist. I will keep using until something better comes along!</li>
    <li> Wow I am amazed at how fast the Rejuvinol worked! I had been travelling on business and gotten very little sleep so my face and eye area was looking a little worn. I got the rejuvinol the other day and the first night i tried it i woke up looking refreshed! I was amazed at how tight my skin looked! This was definately a great surprise and so worth every penny!!</li>

    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have found the Rejuvinol system to be excellent. I am experiencing great moisturiztion on the skin and an overall tighter and firmer complexion. I did research on the active ingredient argiriline and not surprisingly the medical information on it really good. It was quite surprising maybe you will find it helpful.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline is the name of the molecule acetyl hexapeptide-3. When applied topically, Argireline seems to have an effect similar to that of BOTOX injections on the muscles of the face. Peptides are small fragments of proteins. Proteins are the main building blocks of nearly all living tissues. Argireline, acetyl hexapeptide-3, is a chain of six amino acids that are attached to the residue of acetic acid. Topical application of Argireline is the only method of delivery that as yet has been tested.  &lt;br /&gt;Argireline relaxes facial tension, leading to the relaxation of facial muscles that contribute to lines and wrinkles. Researchers think Argireline works by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters released by the brain that tell these facial muscles to tense. The result is relaxed musculature and reduced wrinkles and lines. The Argireline&#x27;s effects are very similar to those of BOTOX injections. But where the FDA only allows BOTOX serum to be injected in limited areas of the face, Argireline may be applied wherever lines and wrinkles appear. One published study showed a 30% reduction in wrinkle size after only 30 days of using Argireline or its generic equivalent, acetyl hexapeptide-3.Yes. Argireline is one of the most exciting ingredients to come along in recent years. Argireline works on mechanical lines and tension-related wrinkles and therefore makes an excellent combination with other, more traditional, anti wrinkle ingredients that work by resurfacing and moisturizing the skin.Argireline is a favorable and promising alternative to botox injections and one that is highly recommended when foundin anti aging skin care products that have additional effective ingredients. Look for Argireline or acetyl hexapeptide-3 in the ingredients before you buy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I personally love these 2 creams. I am an avid Botox user. I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have been doing botox since it hit the market. Rejuvinol and Rejuvox help maintain the relaxed effect between my botox injections which can vary in price. I pay $550.00 every 6-8 months. I used to pay that ammount every 3-4 months. Thanks to these wonderful creams I am saving money between visits. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The quest for a Botox alternative is a popular pursuit among both skin care manufacturers and consumers. While Botox is highly effective in reducing motion wrinkles, it is expensive, requires physician-administered injections, and occasionally leads to side effects, such as droopy eyelids. Not surprisingly, products touted as Botox alternatives keep popping up. Acetyl hexapeptide-3 (trade name Argireline and main ingredient in REJUVINOL) is one of the seemingly promising new Botox alternatives.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline is manufactured by a Spanish company Lipotec and is a hexapeptide (a chain of 6 amino acids) attached to the acetic acid residue. It is believed to work by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters. When applied to the skin, Argireline supposedly relaxes facial tension leading to the reduction in facial lines and wrinkles with regular use. This remotely resembles the effect of Botox, which reduces facial tension and movement by paralyzing facial muscles. Note that Argireline is unrelated in its physiologic effect and mechanism of action to other bioactive skin peptides, such as palmitoyl pentapeptide.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So far, the evidence to support the benefits of Argireline is very promising. In a clinical study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science, acetyl hexapeptide-3 at a 10% concentration has been shown to reduce the depth of wrinkles up to 30% after 30 days of use and this is the amount used in the REJUVINOL formula. There are no other credible clinical studies to be found but many are being conducted. The benefits of long-term use, if any, are unknown but look good.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is it worth a try? The rationale behind REJUVINOL is plausible enough and eventually it may be validated by research as a safe and effective wrinkle fighter. However, at this point neither its effectiveness nor safety can be considered even tentatively proven. Besides, Argireline-based products are not particularly cheap, even compared to Botox. However, I am not sure if their prices reflect a large novelty-hype premium or high costs of the concentrated (10% or more is required) active ingredient. If it&#x27;s the former, the prices may eventually decline.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is one more concern worth mentioning. Botox injections target specific muscles, whereas Argireline (if it indeed works) is likely to relax most of your face. And while Argireline may reduce wrinkles, it may also, in theory, increase facial sag because the neurotransmitters whose release Argireline inhibits, help maintain facial firmness. Notably, a popular firming skin care ingredient DMAE firms by stimulating the release of neurotransmitters and increasing facial tension, i.e. by producing roughly the opposite effect to Argireline. Whether Argireline may indeed contribute to facial sag has not been studied. Until further research is done it is concluded that Rejuvinol is one of the top anti-wrinkle creams on the market and should be around for years to come!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have found the Rejuvinol system to be excellent. I am experiencing great moisturiztion on the skin and an overall tighter and firmer complexion. I did research on the active ingredient argiriline and not surprisingly the medical information on it really good. It was quite surprising maybe you will find it helpful.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline is the name of the molecule acetyl hexapeptide-3. When applied topically, Argireline seems to have an effect similar to that of BOTOX? injections on the muscles of the face. Peptides are small fragments of proteins. Proteins are the main building blocks of nearly all living tissues. Argireline, acetyl hexapeptide-3, is a chain of six amino acids that are attached to the residue of acetic acid. Topical application of Argireline is the only method of delivery that as yet has been tested.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline relaxes facial tension, leading to the relaxation of facial muscles that contribute to lines and wrinkles. Researchers think Argireline works by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters released by the brain that tell these facial muscles to tense. The result is relaxed musculature and reduced wrinkles and lines. The Argireline&#x27;s effects are very similar to those of BOTOX? injections. But where the FDA only allows BOTOX? serum to be injected in limited areas of the face, Argireline may be applied wherever lines and wrinkles appear. One published study showed a 30% reduction in wrinkle size after only 30 days of using Argireline or its generic equivalent, acetyl hexapeptide-3.Yes. Argireline is one of the most exciting ingredients to come along in recent years. Argireline works on mechanical lines and tension-related wrinkles and therefore makes an excellent combination with other, more traditional, anti wrinkle ingredients that work by resurfacing and moisturizing the skin.Argireline is a favorable and promising alternative to botox injections and one that is highly recommended when found in anti aging skin care products that have additional effective ingredients. Look for Argireline or acetyl hexapeptide-3 in the ingredients before you buy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews here, I ordered the Rejuvinol AM/PM fcial creams. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the adage \\&quot;Your skin will get worse before it gets better\\&quot; &#x27;cuz \\&quot;Who needs that?\\&quot; That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m always in search of the skincare regime that will completely convert me and never make me troll the boards again!! lol  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am 49 and I have to say in just one evening, my skin looked firmer, perkier and just all-around more healthy. Needless to say, I was excited to embark on day 2 of the regime. I liked the product even better the second day (I usually prefer gels, but I love the scent and feel of the Rejuvinol). And, no irritation...just younger looking, perkier (for lack of a better word) skin. On Day 3, stubborn scar from one obnoxious hormonal breakout is actually disappearing. I can&#x27;t believe it! This has been the most stubborn $#%%% in my whole life!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On Day 4, I go shopping and I buy 3 things because when I look in the mirror...my skin looks good!! This is usually so not the case! So, now Dermalogics has cost me even more money.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On Day 5, that&#x27;s it...I gotta go mortgage the house and go for the full system. And this is from a woman who has literally tried everything!! I have to admit...I really enjoy trying new products..so its my own fault. But, the train stops here. No kidding. These products gave me the fastest, best results of any product that I have ever used. I will usually try to shop around for savings but when it comes to my face and skin I have realized that i have wasted so much money on cheaper products that jsut dont work wo why not order the top of the line produycts that have proven results!?!?! Im sold......:)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have been using this system for over 2 months now. I have seen the small, fine laugh lines around my eyes disappear. I have also seen the deep groove on my forehead and around my mouth get more shallow. They are almost non-existent. I absolutely love the texture and fragrance. Two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I have to say that in the short time I&#x27;ve been using these face creams I can see a difference in my skins apprearance. It looks smoother. Definately not a complete line eraser but it lightened the lines that were already there.</li>
    <li> I am using the Rejuvinol for 7 weeks and I think it is fantastic. The smile lines and crows feet have but all disappeared. I just apply it each morning and then put on my makeup before I head out to work. I am a music teacher and to get compliments from the students about how great I look  really makes me feel good. The product is brilliant!</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;The quest for a Botox alternative is a popular pursuit among both skin care manufacturers and consumers.

    <li> I got my bottles on Tuesday last ... and began using it that evening, and twice a day since then ... so 9 days, counting this morning.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, it should be realized that I have never used an \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; product before ... and I&#x27;m 54, with oil-prone skin [especially in my T-zone] that is both sensitive and prone to breakouts.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was only after I managed to get my face clear [via OCM ... thank you ladies] that I realized I had some \\&quot;catch up\\&quot; work to do in that area. So I&#x27;ve been using eye creams and Vitamin C serum since late August.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The wrinkles above my lip ... under my nose ... were fairly deep ... particularly around a scar I have from a dog bite I got about 2.5 years ago. [Long story ... very embarrassing ... Rolling Eyes ] At any rate ... I have rather deep wrinkling in that area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am, by nature, skeptical of these sorts of things ... and I was particularly skeptical that Rejubinol AM/PM would help with the lines around this scar. After all, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;normal\\&quot; wrinkling.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate \\&quot;softening\\&quot; but after two days, I was surprised to note that the \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; near the eye were almost non-existent ... and the deeper lines in that area had \\&quot;shortened\\&quot; and softened.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What was even more astonishing was that the lines near my scar [above my lip] were also softened! (Laughing)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought this was simply my imagination. After all ... you put a product onto an area and you hope/expect that it will do what it claims to do. (Laughing)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This morning, however, I looked more closely ... with my 12X magnifying mirror ... and sure enough ... fine lines have \\&quot;disappeared\\&quot; and my deeper lines have softened so much that it&#x27;s readily visible.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of the lines around the scarred area are \\&quot;gone\\&quot; ... while the deeper ones in this area have softened considerably as well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everywhere I have applied this product ... the fine lines ... gone. Deeper lines ... shorter and softer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I put this on, I don&#x27;t notice a \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; sensation so much as a \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; sensation. You do feel it working ... and now I know that it&#x27;s not just a sensation ... it&#x27;s actually working!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I now wish I&#x27;d figured out how to take my own picture \\&quot;before\\&quot; so that I could compare the photos ... but it&#x27;s not my imagination ... this stuff is truly marvellous!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank you again, for offering this wonderful product!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Die drei Gebr&amp;uuml;der Berlin plus Cory Becker versuchen sich am gro&amp;szlig;en Rock&#x60;n&#x60;Roll - gepaart mit Politik. &amp;Uuml;brig bleibt der nette Versuch, die H&amp;ouml;rerschaft mit drei leidlich gelungenen Tracks am Anfang des Albums zu &amp;uuml;bert&amp;ouml;lpeln.&lt;br /&gt;Der Opener &amp;quot;Bombs Below&amp;quot; wartet mit einigen fragw&amp;uuml;rdigen politischen Ausagen, einer guten Gitarrendichte und einem eing&amp;auml;ngigen Refrain auf. &amp;quot;Bom Bom Bom&amp;quot; ist ebenso eing&amp;auml;ngig mit seinem Good Groove. Doch ansonsten gelingen der Band au&amp;szlig;er weiteren, schlechteren Variationen dieser Titel, die doch eigentlich noch okay sind, nichts nenneswertes mehr.&lt;br /&gt;Eine ungesunde Melange aus Poserrock, altbekannten Riffs und im Verlauf des Albums immer fragw&amp;uuml;rdigeren Texten &amp;uuml;ber USA und Politics machen dieses Album letztendlich doch ungenie&amp;szlig;bar. Netter Versuch, doch ziemlich &amp;uuml;berfl&amp;uuml;ssig.</li>
    <li> Ihave been a member of the Essential Skin Care Forum (username - trinalove) for a few months now and joined because I was looking for a skincare product that would actually work, as I was tired of wasting so much money on empty promises of \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot;, etc. It was via this forum that I first heard of Rejuvinol AM/PM.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After reading so many very enthusiastic recommendations of the Rejuvinol products, I decided to order the AM/PM combo for myself to try. (Just for your info, I am 39 years old with very dry skin and fine lines.)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Immediately after using the products for the first time, I noticed a firming effect on my skin. Not only that, the products left my terribly dry skin feeling comfortable and not at all irritated. This impressed me enough to buy the other facial products that Dermalogics sells (Lumnaderm and Ocuderm). To my absolute delight, continued use of these products over the last 5 to 6 weeks has made what can only be described as a miraculous difference to my skin all over. Not only is it firm now, but the \\&quot;11\\&quot; lines on my forehead have completely disappeared and my other lines seem to be less noticeable already. My skin is smooth and clear. The red blotchiness I used to have has faded and the very few blemishes I now get are cleared up fast. And this effect lasts! Even if I miss my  regime on the occasional evening when I apply fake tan to my face, the improvements are still maintained!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the first time in years, I feel comfortable enough with my skin to leave the house without wearing any make-up. I can&#x27;&#x27;t remember the last time it looked this good! My skin glows with health! Because I suffer from a form of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis, for which I have to take anti-inflammatory medication daily, my skin has suffered in the past - becoming very dry, dull and ashen. Dermalogics&#x27;s products have made a world of difference to me and given me back a lot of my old confidence. Over the last couple of weeks, people have even been telling me how great my skin&#x27;&#x27;s looking and if I&#x27;&#x27;ve been doing anything different to cause it to look that way. So, of course, I&#x27;&#x27;ve been recommending REjuvinol AM/PM to them all! Thank you for producing such brilliant products. I was a former sceptic about anti-aging skincare, but your company has changed my mind entirely. Dermalogics&#x27; products actually work! Your company can certainly count on my loyalty and I shall continue to spread the word about the amazing difference your products can make to skin. I really can&#x27;&#x27;t thank you enough. Please keep up the good work!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also have to laugh at some of these other reviews that are written by people who seem to all have the same \\&quot;agenda\\&quot;. I wonder if these reviews are from a disgruntled customer or a competing company? Either way they are so bogus its easy to see right through them. Enjoy Everyone! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have been using Rejuvinol AM/PM twice a day for almost three weeks and have seen a significant overall improvement in the appearance of my skin. It has softened the fine lines around my eyes and forehead area, my skin has a much tighter and smoother appearance. I am 34 years old and tried many differant products to maintain youthful skin, this product appears to be working well. I also use botox, restyline and perlane and this product seems to enhance the effects of these injectables. I have also noticed more limitation in the muscle contractions in my forehead therefore minimizing appearance of lines. I am told I look 25 and would never be singled out as over being 30! That is reason enough for me to continue a preventative regimen including Rejuvinol and botox to keep my skin looking young and prevent future damage instead of trying to fix it later. Good Luck to everyone in their youthful search! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I fall under the 30-something age bracket when age-defying creams are a big part of my beauty regime. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rejuvinol and Rejuvox pretty much ended the search for the Botox alternative I have combed the earth over for!</li>
    <li> I received my bottles of Rejuvinol AM/PM from Amazon. The delivery was so prompt- it came to Canada, no less, in a really short period of time. The recommended usage is 2 x per day so I am on my 5th application with no trouble at all. I have mild rosacea and combination skin somewhat thinned by retinol. Today it looks smooth &amp; even &amp; almost a little less wrinkled. I&#x27;m 52 so there are some definite creases in there that I really don&#x27;t expect a topical to rid, but the general appearance after 2 days looks pretty good. I topped it with Valmont 24 hour cream mixed with a little bit of foundation. I see an order for a full bottle in the future if this keeps up. And I was so very skeptical......WOW! I really love the fast shipping to Canada and the efectiveness of the Rejuvinol. Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> J&#x27;ai trouv le systme de Rejuvinol pour tre excellent. J&#x27;prouve le grand moisturiztion sur la peau et un teint plus serr et plus ferme global. J&#x27;ai fait la recherche sur l&#x27;argiriline de substance active et pas tonnamment l&#x27;information mdicale l-dessus vraiment bon. Il vous tonnait tout  fait peut-tre le trouvera utile.     Argireline est le nom de l&#x27;actyle hexapeptide-3 de molcule. Quand appliqu topique, Argireline semble-t-il avoir un effet semblable  celui de BOTOX ? injections sur les muscles du visage. Les peptides sont de petits fragments des protines. Les protines sont les modules principaux de presque tous les tissus vivants. Argireline, l&#x27;actyle hexapeptide-3, est une chane de six acides amins qui sont attachs au rsidu de l&#x27;acide actique. L&#x27;application topique d&#x27;Argireline est la seule mthode de livraison qui a t examine jusqu&#x27;ici.     Argireline dtend la tension faciale, menant  la relaxation des muscles faciaux qui contribuent aux lignes et aux rides. Les chercheurs pensent des travaux d&#x27;Argireline en empchant le dgagement des neurotransmetteurs libres par le cerveau qui indiquent ces muscles faciaux tendre. Le rsultat est musculature dtendue et rides et lignes rduites. Les effets de l&#x27;Argireline sont trs semblables  ceux de BOTOX ? injections. Mais o la FDA permet-elle seulement BOTOX ? le srum  injecter dans des secteurs limits du visage, Argireline peut tre appliqu partout o les lignes et les rides apparaissent. Une tude dite a montr une rduction de 30% de taille de ride aprs seulement 30 jours d&#x27;employer Argireline ou son quivalent gnrique, l&#x27;actyle hexapeptide-3.Yes. Argireline est l&#x27;un des ingrdients les plus passionnants  venir le long ces dernires annes. Argireline travaille sur les lignes mcaniques et les rides tension-connexes et fait donc une excellente combinaison avec autre, plus traditionnel, anti les ingrdients de ride qui fonctionnent  ct de reblanchir et de hydrater la peau. Argireline est une alternative favorable et prometteuse aux injections et  une de botox qui sont fortement recommandes une fois trouves dans les produits anti de vieillissement de soin de peau qui ont les ingrdients efficaces additionnels. Rechercher Argireline ou actyle hexapeptide-3 dans les ingrdients avant que vous achetiez.</li>

In a clinical study published in the International Journal of Cosmetic Science, acetyl hexapeptide-3 at a 10% concentration has been shown to reduce the depth of wrinkles up to 30% after 30 days of use and this is the amount used in the REJUVINOL formula. There are no other credible clinical studies to be found but many are being conducted. The benefits of long-term use, if any, are unknown but look good.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is it worth a try? The rationale behind REJUVINOL is plausible enough and eventually it may be validated by research as a safe and effective wrinkle fighter. However, at this point neither its effectiveness nor safety can be considered even tentatively proven. Besides, Argireline-based products are not particularly cheap, even compared to Botox. However, I am not sure if their prices reflect a large novelty-hype premium or high costs of the concentrated (10% or more is required) active ingredient. If it&#x27;s the former, the prices may eventually decline.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is one more concern worth mentioning. Botox injections target specific muscles, whereas Argireline (if it indeed works) is likely to relax most of your face. And while Argireline may reduce wrinkles, it may also, in theory, increase facial sag because the neurotransmitters whose release Argireline inhibits, help maintain facial firmness. Notably, a popular firming skin care ingredient DMAE firms by stimulating the release of neurotransmitters and increasing facial tension, i.e. by producing roughly the opposite effect to Argireline. Whether Argireline may indeed contribute to facial sag has not been studied. Until further research is done it is concluded that Rejuvinol is one of the top anti-wrinkle creams on the market and should be around for years to come!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rejuvinol and Rejuvox are magnificent. I was a bit hesitant on placing an order for these products online because the only thing I had to go by is the research I have done in reference to the ingredients. Alot of people wrote reviews on how great the products worked for them. I&#x27;m glad I tried these creams.  I will continue to use them religiously. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have nothing but good things to say about these products. They really work for me. Of course there are no miracle cures for wrinkles although these products come close. They work as long as u continue to use them regularly. It&#x27;s a topical freezing of the skin people. Not a permanant wrinkle solution. Unless you have the money to invest in the maintenence of your beautiful face, then stick to your usual.</li>
    <li> My sincere apologies for my previous review.  &lt;br /&gt;It was meant for a totally different product :)</li>
    <li> These creams really work.... &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with these products.</li>
    <li> I sent this to a military member in IRAQ-- where it&#x27;s 120+ and very dry. She loves the cream. I think part of the problem for some of the review types is: Your skin has years of sun and abuse; some of you smoke, most of us lack sleep. We can&#x27;t cure this in 30 minutes. It&#x27;s NOT a TV show!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different anti aging creams and this has been the best so far.  It was rated #1 by consumer reports so I assumed I could trust their un-biased review.  They were right!  You can see it working almost immediately and the long term effects are brilliant.  Even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey, it has turned out to be worth every penny.  I just turned 40 and recieved many compliments about how I look so much younger.  Ordering was easy and delivery was very efficient.  I live in Hawaii but the shipping time was much quicker than most other products. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rejuvinol  for about one month. Since starting to use this I have noticed that my skin is dramatically clearer and looks much younger.). No burning or irritation even on my sensitive skin. People comment how great my skin looks .  I Love  Rejuvinol</li>
    <li> I have tried countless different anti-aging remedies and over the counter products and can I just say these 2 creams deliverd dramatic results on my complexion. It&#x27;s much smoother and tighter than when I was using just Botox alone. I still use Botox along with these products. I have been \\&quot;Botoxing\\&quot; since before it was FDA approved. I have seen better results with the Botox since these creams. They go on smoothly and are easily absorbed. They worked wonders on me!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine and I both purchased this product. My skin is normally slightly oily and I would never have imagined a facial care product could have such an over-drying effect. I noticed an over-tightened, dry feeling the first time I used it that only increased the second and third time. I finally gave up and just threw it out. My friend had the same drying effect but she stuck it out longer and actually noticed an INCREASE in the fine lines around her eyes, plus a red, patchiness on areas of her face that developed after 10 days or so. She ended up going to her dermatologist who managed to undo the damage with an expensive prescription salve. I definitely would not recommend buying this product. Or at least use a trial version first if available to test for drying of skin or adverse skin effects.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Rejuvinol product for about 5 months now and the results live up to what they advertise. The moisturizer is very lightweight and has never given me any pimples/blemishes. You don&#x27;t need to cake it on either, a thin layer will keep you skin from drying out all day. I turned my Mom on to this stuff too because she&#x27;s a flight attendant and is always battling the dry skin from the air on the planes. She loves it too! It also solved her dry skin problems. I know it is a little costly but im sure thats because its quality stuff. I would never buy face cream for $20 because it cant be any good. Bottom line is that this worked for me and my mom and we are very satisfied</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe these reviews are real! I have tried innumerous creams and I must say that this is the worst ever, even a $7 dollar cream that you buy at Duane Reade is better than this!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;While La Mer, Strivectin and others did not deliver the miracles described all over the web they were very good creams and extremely moisturizing cream - you can feel the quality.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rejuvinol on the other hand feels weird (it sticks to your face one minute after you put it on). My face now is more prone to break outs and black heads and the skin still looks tired and dehydrated.  There has been 0 improvement and likely at least a 10% negative effect. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can tell the quality from the product even on the bottle - after one week the label was already fading.  Please do not waste your money - notice that unlike the other \\&quot;miracle creams\\&quot; this is not sold in any high end store and that is for a very good reason - it sucks! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This day and night cream combo was highly spoke of by a group of highly informed self preserving women in my office so I figured what the heck, if the plastic surgery junkies are raving about these creams they must really work. &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give them a try.</li>
    <li> For close to $100, I was expecting nothing shy of a miracle. I spent a lot of money for this cream and it worked it&#x27;s miracles. If anything it made me. I Must say it made a dramatic improvement immediately! &lt;br /&gt;No breakouts and beatiful soft supple skin...I love it!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And the company/manufacturer deserves absolute praise and recognition for the umbelievable products it has created!</li>
    <li> For the past ten years I have had a problem with flaking near my nose and on my forehead. I have tried many different types of exfoliants to cleanse these areas. The result has always been the same. After application and drying, these area turn \\&quot;beat\\&quot; red....to the extent that I cannot leave the house. Instead of exfoliants, I have been using soap and water, then drying and applying a very liberal amount of moisturizer. However, no matter how little moisturizer I apply, within hours a slight crusting appears again.  &lt;br /&gt;Your Rejuvinol AM/PM product is amazing. Not only does it not leave me \\&quot;red\\&quot;....but it is self moisturizing without residue. My skin is smooth to the touch....problem solved. I also love the nighttime cream cause i wake up feelin nice and soft.  &lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the product.....it really works.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;In a remarkable turn of events, arguably one of the strangest in the history of cosmetics, women across the country are putting a stretch-mark cream called Rejuvinol AM/PM on their face to diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and crows&#x27; feet. And, if consumer sales are any indication of a product&#x27;s effectiveness, Rejuvinol AM/PM is nothing short of a miracle. Women, as well as a growing number of \\&quot;Boomer\\&quot; men, are buying so much Rejuvinol AM/PM that finding a tube at your local cosmetic counter has become just about impossible. Has everyone gone mad? Well...not really.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Scientific Breakthrough or Dumb Luck?  &lt;br /&gt;Although Rejuvinol AM/PM functional components were already backed by clinical trials documenting their ability to visibly reduce the appearance of existing stretch marks (prominent because of their depth, length, discoloration and texture)... the success of Rejuvinol AM/PM as an anti-wrinkle cream was \\&quot;dumb luck,\\&quot; says Rudy Gay, spokesperson for Dermalogics, Rejuvinol AM/PM? manufacturer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When we first handed out samples of the Rejuvinol AM/PM formula to employees and customers as part of our market research, the sample tubes were simply marked \\&quot;topical cream\\&quot; with the lot number underneath,\\&quot; Mr. Gay explains. \\&quot;As the samples were passed to friends and family, the message became a little muddled and some people used this \\&quot;topical cream\\&quot; as a facial moisturizer. As we began to receive feedback from users, like \\&quot;I look 10 years younger\\&quot; and \\&quot;I can&#x27;t even notice my crows&#x27; feet\\&quot; we knew we had something more than America&#x27;s most effective stretch-mark cream. The point was driven home as store owners began reporting that almost as many people were purchasing Rejuvinol as an anti-wrinkle cream as were buying it to reduce stretch marks.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Steven Lebowitz, PhD, Dermalogic&#x27;s Director of Scientific Affairs, says, \\&quot;Clearly, people were seeing results, but we didn&#x27;t have a scientific explanation as to why this wrinkle-reduction was occurring. However, based on the incredibly positive reports, I started using it myself applying Rejuvinol to my face after shaving.\\&quot; Dr. Lebowitz adds, \\&quot;On a personal note, my wife tells me I haven&#x27;t looked this good in years.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dumb Luck Strikes Again!  &lt;br /&gt;Then, on Tuesday, July 2, 2003, at a meeting of the 20th World Congress of Dermatology in Paris, France, a series of studies detailing the superior wrinkle-reducing properties of a patented oligo-peptide \\&quot;called Pal-KTTKS\\&quot; versus retinol, vitamin C, and placebo, on \\&quot;photo-aged skin\\&quot; was presented.1,2 \\&quot;As luck would have it,\\&quot; Dr. Lebowitz states, \\&quot;the anti-wrinkle oligo-peptide tested in the breakthrough clinical trials turned out to be a key ingredient in the Rejuvinol cream.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In the trials, subjects applied the patented peptide solution to the crows&#x27; feet area on one side of the face, and a cream containing either retinol, vitamin C, or a placebo to the other side.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Subjects in the Pal-KTTKS/retinol study applied the cream once a day for 2 months and then twice a day for the next 2 months. Using special image analysis, the study&#x27;s authors reported \\&quot;significant improvement\\&quot; in both the overall appearance of skin tone and wrinkles for those women using the peptide solution.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Better yet, at the 2-month halfway point, the peptide solution worked nearly 1.5 times faster than retinol \\&quot;in measured parameters,\\&quot; and without the inflammation retinol often causes in sensitive skin. As was expected, the results of the remaining studies confirmed that the Pal-KTTKS solution&#x27;s effectiveness at reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles far exceeded both vitamin C and placebo.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A smoother, younger complexion, with less irritation and faster results-all without expensive (and painful) peels, implants or injections.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Better than Retinol and Vitamin C, But Is Rejuvinol AM/PM Better than Botox?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dr. Jennifer Cifelli, PhD, RD, Director of Women&#x27;s Health at Minneapolis based Golden Sun Systems, exclusive distributor for Dermalogics, explains, \\&quot;Leading dermatologists agree that Botox is the preferred treatment for moderate to severe frown lines between the brow. But ever since it was discovered that Rejuvinol could reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and crows&#x27; feet... the kind of fine lines, wrinkles and crows feet that can add 10-15 years to your appearance and which costly medical treatments often leave behind... skin-care professionals have been recommending, and using, Rejuvinol.\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In fact, researchers believe non-invasive alternatives are better, because, Dr. Cifelli continues, \\&quot;Topical creams and gels offer gradual, continual results, while the effects of injections, facial peels, and dermabrasions are rougher on the skin and wear off.\\&quot; In other words, Rejuvinol AM/PM helps give you a youthful, healthy, glowing complexion faster than retinol, far superior to vitamin C, and without irritation, needles, or surgery. Even better, many dermatologists and plastic surgeons recommend Rejuvinol AM/PM in conjunction with cosmetic procedures, including Botox.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, if you see someone applying an anti-stretch mark cream to their face, don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve gone off the deep end... they may be smarter than you think.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> First I would like to thank you for the great customer service you demonstrated during our phone conversation on June 16 regarding your product -Rejuvinol. The offer of the discount on shipping was a nice surprise. &lt;br /&gt;Secondly I wanted to write and let you know I received both samples earlier today and as of this email-you have 2 customers for life! I shared the product with my roommate and we both tried it immediately. It was amazing and it didn&#x27;t even take 10 minutes to see the incredible difference. We are both in our early forties and have those \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot; forehead creases (and no I never did believe they made us look wise:)) Within seconds of applying the product , they were dramatically reduced and by the time 10 minutes had past-basically they no longer existed.  &lt;br /&gt;First thing tomorrow morning I am heading for my nearest Costco to pick up a few jars for myself and one for my roommate. You can bet we both will be spreading the word about your fantastic cream. I like buying on amazon but Costco is right down the road from me so i can get it same day! &lt;br /&gt;Many thanks for having a product that really does what it says it will and with the added bonus of being most affordable . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rest assured you truly have a \\&quot;winner\\&quot; of product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I am still waiting for the lines to go away completely. Although they have certainly diminished I guess there&#x27;s no cure to aging.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about two weeks ago. I have be using it religiously and I love it! My skin feels great. I already see some results in my laughing lines! Plus my makeup goes on even smoother and doesnt wind up caking in between my lines! Try it, you too will love it!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product as an alternative to botox injections that I have researched. Great product all the way around!</li>
    <li> My second order placed. So very happy with these products. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with these creams! I saw immediate results upon application. Definately the most effective topical line freeze cream on the market.</li>
    <li> I am a Plastic Surgeon and part of being Board Cerified, a Plastic Surgeon is obligated to keep the patient&#x27;s best interest at heart. No Plastic Surgeon would ever perform Botox at 3-4 month interval because it takes at least a month for it to take full affect. Typically, Botox is performed in 6-9 month intervals, therefore, I am quite certain the previous poster has never had Botox and does not know what they are talking about. As for the recommending a facial cream, a Plastic Surgeon would NEVER recommend any specific facial cream, that would mean being biased which would lead to removable of our Certification. Also, performed enough times, it DOES become permanent. We offer generic suggestions designed for each individual need. In reference to Rejuvinol, it is my understanding through my colleages, that it does not do what it claims it does. It is a very expensive claim. I personally would never use it nor would I ever let my wife use it.</li>
    <li> These products are working miraculously for me.  I have placed my 3rd order and will continue to use.  &lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to fake I&#x27;m some kind of expert like so many of these ridiculus reveiws. It&#x27;s the most bogus bunch of nonsense Ive ever seen. I&#x27;m just an average customer who hit the dreaded age40 and wanted to do something for myself. I only wish I&#x27;d have read these reveiws before trying this. I not only ended up with the dry red face others got but I&#x27;m also seeing the facial sagging that was mentioned. There wasn&#x27;t a single sign of this sagging before using this cream for only two months. And the dry red affect just made the wrinkles worse. It doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me that someone would give it five stars but say it could cause facial sagging and it needs more than just one clinical trial to see if it works. Either I read that wrong or it sounds just plain nuts.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  I think people should follow the advice of other people and read all these reveiws before spending so much money for nothing. All I can say for me, is NEVER AGAIN.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> What You Should Know about the Risks and Benefits of Plastic Surgery.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Topical treatments can help improve fine wrinkles and skin texture. However, rapid and dramatic improvements are more likely to be achieved with plastic surgery. But don&#x27;t rush to schedule your plastic surgery just yet. First, here are some facts you should know.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plastic surgery is expensive. In the US, a facelift costs from $6,000 to $12,000.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Any surgery is potentially dangerous, including plastic surgery. Complications are rare but they do occur, ranging from scarring to fatalities. Plastic surgery may be particularly risky if you have certain health conditions (e.g. diabetes).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different. Some people do much better than others, even when treated by the same plastic surgeon.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It may take several weeks or months before your face fully recovers from plastic surgery.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plastic surgery might adversely affect the physiology of your skin and underlying tissues, speeding up the aging process.  &lt;br /&gt;If you decide to undergo plastic surgery, keep in mind the following.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;With plastic surgery, more is not necessarily better. For instance, too tight or too frequent facelifts may create a distorted, unnatural look. The result may be worse than having no plastic surgery at all.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Find a board certified surgeon with a vast experience in the plastic surgery. Search thoroughly, compare different plastic surgeons, talk to their former patients.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is somewhat more risky to have plastic surgery in a surgeon&#x27;s office than in a hospital. If you are having an in-office plastic surgery, make sure that the facility is accredited by AAAASF (The American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plastic surgery does not slow down the aging of the skin but may actually accelerate it. Therefore, plastic surgery is not a substitute for skin rejuvenation measures discussed in various articles at Smart Skin Care Site. Actually, after a plastic surgery you should be even more diligent in preserving your skin&#x27;s youth.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before going for plastic surgery, give a few month try to topical skin rejuvenation treatments (see Treatments section of this site). The results may be dramatic enough to change your mind.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have found the Rejuvinol system to be excellent. I am experiencing great moisturiztion on the skin and an overall tighter and firmer complexion. I did research on the active ingredient argiriline and not surprisingly the medical information on it really good. It was quite surprising maybe you will find it helpful.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline is the name of the molecule acetyl hexapeptide-3. When applied topically, Argireline seems to have an effect similar to that of BOTOX injections on the muscles of the face. Peptides are small fragments of proteins. Proteins are the main building blocks of nearly all living tissues. Argireline, acetyl hexapeptide-3, is a chain of six amino acids that are attached to the residue of acetic acid. Topical application of Argireline is the only method of delivery that as yet has been tested.  &lt;br /&gt;Argireline relaxes facial tension, leading to the relaxation of facial muscles that contribute to lines and wrinkles. Researchers think Argireline works by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters released by the brain that tell these facial muscles to tense. The result is relaxed musculature and reduced wrinkles and lines. The Argireline&#x27;s effects are very similar to those of BOTOX injections. But where the FDA only allows BOTOX serum to be injected in limited areas of the face, Argireline may be applied wherever lines and wrinkles appear. One published study showed a 30% reduction in wrinkle size after only 30 days of using Argireline or its generic equivalent, acetyl hexapeptide-3.Yes. Argireline is one of the most exciting ingredients to come along in recent years. Argireline works on mechanical lines and tension-related wrinkles and therefore makes an excellent combination with other, more traditional, anti wrinkle ingredients that work by resurfacing and moisturizing the skin.Argireline is a favorable and promising alternative to botox injections and one that is highly recommended when found in anti aging skin care products that have additional effective ingredients. Look for Argireline or acetyl hexapeptide-3 in the ingredients before you buy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read the reviews at this site before ordering.  Instead I did a google search on the best wrinkle repair creams and hit their site.  With the phenominal reviews from \\&quot;real\\&quot; people how could I resist?  The creams came in a small box, unsealed jars and no packing slip.  They do nothing as far as moisturizing and I&#x27;ve seen no improvement in my skin tone.  After reading the rediculious five star reviews here at amazon I&#x27;m embarassed and insulted they honestly think we buy one bit of the positive ratings.  What a sham.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half way through a bottle of this so I thought it might be time to jot down some thoughts about this serum. I&#x27;m sure many of you know that my fave serum thus far has been the Vivier serum. I&#x27;m pretty sure you know this because you must be sick and tired of me butting in with posts about the Vivier when other people ask for opinions on vit C serums (sorry!) Bad Grin  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have tried the Cellex-C, the Skinceuticals, the CellularSkinRx the Vivier (for me) was the best in terms of texture. I have normal skin (sometimes combo) and found the first two felt drying while the CSRx felt a bit too oily. The Vivier was the best choice between those extremes. While I had an open mind, I was pretty sure that the Rejuvinol AM/PM would not win over the Vivier. Ok, that statement seems contradictory - guess I didn&#x27;t have an open mind after all Laughing  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, it turns out that there is something with even better texture (for my skin) than the Vivier - namely the Rejuvinol AM/PM (yeah, I&#x27;m as surprised as you are that I am making this statement!). This, texture wise, sits in between the Cellex-C/SC and the Vivier. It has less slip than the Vivier - it feels absolutely \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. You pat it in, it absorbs straight away, your skin feels like there is absolutely nothing on it. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel tight (had that with the straight Cellex-C and the SC serums), it doesn&#x27;t feel somewhat oily (had that with the CSRx), it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s been a bit moisturised (had that with the Vivier). It just feels like you&#x27;ve applied nothing. Anyway, you get the point - me impressed with texture Rolling Eyes Laughing  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Before using the Rejuvinol (which I believe is 10% but comprised of 5% each of two different types of vit) I was actually using the 20% Vivier serum. Is the Rejuvinol just as good in the lower concentration? Well, that is very hard to say. I think that the Vivier 20% might have actually been a tad more effective but I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s very difficult to compare things like that. The Rejuvinol, so far, appears to be quite stable. It had a very slight marshmellow tinge to it when I started using it and still looks the same (IMO). I will update on this when I finish the bottle.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which one would I buy in the future? The Rejuvinol is half the size of the Vivier which makes it significantly more expensive. I would like to try the Vivier again and see what I think (luckily I have a sample of the Vivier to compare with Smile). If I really can&#x27;t see the difference between the two then my personal preference based on texture will be to get the Rejuvinol, if my wallet is doing the choosing then it&#x27;ll be the Vivier. If they were around the same price I would be going for the Rejuvinol no doubt.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, a little note about why I spend so much time c**pping on about the texture. Some people may agree and some people may disagree with this, but from my experience with vit serums I now believe that your skin type should largely decide which serum you should buy (assume they are all equally effective). If I had oily skin I&#x27;d be going with the Cellex-C or the Skinceuticals (unless I wanted to use the B5 gel over the top in which case both would be fine for drier skins anyway). If I had very dry skin I would go with the CellularSkinRx one. If I had dry skin it would be the Vivier. If I had normal to combo skin (well, I DO have normal to combo skin!) then I&#x27;d go with the Rejuvinol. Keep in mind, this is just MY preference based on MY experiences with these products. I know that there are people with oilier skins that use the CSRx and like it so I am certainly not saying that this is wrong. Everyone has tehir own skin and will have their own experiences so choose which is best for you. The Rejuvinol for me happens to be the best and I will spare no expense to make my skin look healthy and young!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> There have been several requests to Norstrom&#x27;s stores regarding the product \\&quot;Rejuvinol\\&quot;. Callers have indicated that a reviewer or reviewers made a claim on this site that Nordstrom&#x27;s sells and recommends \\&quot;Rejuvinol\\&quot; to its customers.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;NORDSTROM&#x27;S HAS NOT AT ANY TIME SOLD THIS PRODUCT IN THE PAST, DOES NOT CURRENTLY SELL THIS PRODUCT, AND WILL NOT BE SELLING THIS PRODUCT AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I see a big difference in my skin&#x27;s texture. My gal-pals are insisting that I did botox.  &lt;br /&gt;My complexion has definately improved. This sure beats the 500.00 people pay for the needle!</li>
    <li> I just had to write and tell you what a fantastic product you have in Rejuvinol AM/PM! I&#x27;m a 45-year-old man who suffered with severe acne in my teens and 20s. Back in those days, dermatologists didn&#x27;t have nearly the arsenal of medications to prescribe as they do now, so needless to say, I was left with moderate to heavy scarring on my cheeks, on and around my nose, and behind my ears. I&#x27;ve tried many skin products over the years, but really felt nothing short of actual dermabrasion or chemical peeling would help--that is, until I found your product! I use it once or twice a week, takes just a couple of minutes, and the results have been very impressive. The depth of my scars has been reduced, their color more closely matches that of the surrounding undamaged skin, and my skin is visibly smoother. My only regret is that you didn&#x27;t come up with this stuff 20 years ago! Again, thank you very much for a product that actually does MORE than you claim!!</li>
    <li> Your face cream is the best -- I&#x27;ve tried them all la mer, la prairie, clarins, kinerase and most recently lancome&#x27;s resolution. They are placebo&#x27;s compared to Rejuvinol.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I apply it to my face it fills in the cracks like some space age - age eraser and makes my skin smoother, vibrant and younger. It&#x27;s youth in a tube and alot cheaper and safer than a face lift. Thank you for this wonderful product.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have found the Rejuvinol system to be excellent. I am experiencing great moisturiztion on the skin and an overall tighter and firmer complexion. I did research on the active ingredient argiriline and not surprisingly the medical information on it really good. It was quite surprising maybe you will find it helpful.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline is the name of the molecule acetyl hexapeptide-3. When applied topically, Argireline seems to have an effect similar to that of BOTOX? injections on the muscles of the face. Peptides are small fragments of proteins. Proteins are the main building blocks of nearly all living tissues. Argireline, acetyl hexapeptide-3, is a chain of six amino acids that are attached to the residue of acetic acid. Topical application of Argireline is the only method of delivery that as yet has been tested.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Argireline relaxes facial tension, leading to the relaxation of facial muscles that contribute to lines and wrinkles. Researchers think Argireline works by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters released by the brain that tell these facial muscles to tense. The result is relaxed musculature and reduced wrinkles and lines. The Argireline&#x27;s effects are very similar to those of BOTOX? injections. But where the FDA only allows BOTOX? serum to be injected in limited areas of the face, Argireline may be applied wherever lines and wrinkles appear. One published study showed a 30% reduction in wrinkle size after only 30 days of using Argireline or its generic equivalent, acetyl hexapeptide-3.Yes. Argireline is one of the most exciting ingredients to come along in recent years. Argireline works on mechanical lines and tension-related wrinkles and therefore makes an excellent combination with other, more traditional, anti wrinkle ingredients that work by resurfacing and moisturizing the skin.Argireline is a favorable and promising alternative to botox injections and one that is highly recommended when found in anti aging skin care productsthat have additional effective ingredients. Look for Argireline or acetyl hexapeptide-3 in the ingredients before you buy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have been using Rejuvinol AM/PM and Ocuderm for two weeks now. Absolutely love it. There is a noticeable change in my skin. The most dramatic change has been the skins firmness on face and neck. I lost 20 pounds and although I reached my ideal weight it did a number on my face (saggy). I am thrilled with this product and will continue to use it. When I started using the Rejuvinol AM/PM I did notice a acceleration in product results. As far as crows feet and forehead lines: They are still there but not nearly as noticeable. I want to see results several months down the road. My eyes: still have (fat deposits) but skin is much firmer. My upper lid is what thrills me most. I can see my eyelid again!!! The hooded eyelid is much firmer. Looking forward to a moisturizer in this line and Ocuderm ahs been great getting rid of this problem. Although I don&#x27;t need one in the summer months, I most likely will need it during the winter. I prefer to stay with the same product line. I better stop raving about your product. People will start thinking I work for the company. You have wonderful products!!!!!</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have been a member of the Essential Skin Care Forum (username - trinalove) for a few months now and joined because I was looking for a skincare product that would actually work, as I was tired of wasting so much money on empty promises of \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot;, etc. It was via this forum that I first heard of Rejuvinol AM/PM.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After reading so many very enthusiastic recommendations of the Rejuvinol products, I decided to order the AM/PM combo for myself to try. (Just for your info, I am 39 years old with very dry skin and fine lines.)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Immediately after using the products for the first time, I noticed a firming effect on my skin. Not only that, the products left my terribly dry skin feeling comfortable and not at all irritated. This impressed me enough to buy the other facial products that Dermalogics sells (Lumnaderm and Ocuderm). To my absolute delight, continued use of these products over the last 5 to 6 weeks has made what can only be described as a miraculous difference to my skin all over. Not only is it firm now, but the \\&quot;11\\&quot; lines on my forehead have completely disappeared and my other lines seem to be less noticeable already. My skin is smooth and clear. The red blotchiness I used to have has faded and the very few blemishes I now get are cleared up fast. And this effect lasts! Even if I miss my regime on the occasional evening when I apply fake tan to my face, the improvements are still maintained!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the first time in years, I feel comfortable enough with my skin to leave the house without wearing any make-up. I can&#x27;&#x27;t remember the last time it looked this good! My skin glows with health! Because I suffer from a form of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis, for which I have to take anti-inflammatory medication daily, my skin has suffered in the past - becoming very dry, dull and ashen. Dermalogics&#x27;s products have made a world of difference to me and given me back a lot of my old confidence. Over the last couple of weeks, people have even been telling me how great my skin&#x27;&#x27;s looking and if I&#x27;&#x27;ve been doing anything different to cause it to look that way. So, of course, I&#x27;&#x27;ve been recommending REjuvinol AM/PM to them all! Thank you for producing such brilliant products. I was a former sceptic about anti-aging skincare, but your company has changed my mind entirely. Dermalogics&#x27; products actually work! Your company can certainly count on my loyalty and I shall continue to spread the word about the amazing difference your products can make to skin. I really can&#x27;&#x27;t thank you enough. Please keep up the good work!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also have to laugh at some of these other reviews that are written by people who seem to all have the same \\&quot;agenda\\&quot;. I wonder if these reviews are from a disgruntled customer or a competing company? Either way they are so bogus its easy to see right through them. Enjoy Everyone!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got my bottles on Tuesday last ... and began using it that evening, and twice a day since then ... so 9 days, counting this morning.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now, it should be realized that I have never used an \\&quot;anti-wrinkle\\&quot; product before ... and I&#x27;m 54, with oil-prone skin [especially in my T-zone] that is both sensitive and prone to breakouts.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was only after I managed to get my face clear [via OCM ... thank you ladies] that I realized I had some \\&quot;catch up\\&quot; work to do in that area. So I&#x27;ve been using eye creams and Vitamin C serum since late August.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The wrinkles above my lip ... under my nose ... were fairly deep ... particularly around a scar I have from a dog bite I got about 2.5 years ago. [Long story ... very embarrassing ... Rolling Eyes ] At any rate ... I have rather deep wrinkling in that area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am, by nature, skeptical of these sorts of things ... and I was particularly skeptical that Rejubinol AM/PM would help with the lines around this scar. After all, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;normal\\&quot; wrinkling.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any immediate \\&quot;softening\\&quot; but after two days, I was surprised to note that the \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot; near the eye were almost non-existent ... and the deeper lines in that area had \\&quot;shortened\\&quot; and softened.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What was even more astonishing was that the lines near my scar [above my lip] were also softened! (Laughing)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought this was simply my imagination. After all ... you put a product onto an area and you hope/expect that it will do what it claims to do. (Laughing)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This morning, however, I looked more closely ... with my 12X magnifying mirror ... and sure enough ... fine lines have \\&quot;disappeared\\&quot; and my deeper lines have softened so much that it&#x27;s readily visible.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Some of the lines around the scarred area are \\&quot;gone\\&quot; ... while the deeper ones in this area have softened considerably as well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Everywhere I have applied this product ... the fine lines ... gone. Deeper lines ... shorter and softer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I put this on, I don&#x27;t notice a \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; sensation so much as a \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; sensation. You do feel it working ... and now I know that it&#x27;s not just a sensation ... it&#x27;s actually working!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I now wish I&#x27;d figured out how to take my own picture \\&quot;before\\&quot; so that I could compare the photos ... but it&#x27;s not my imagination ... this stuff is truly marvellous!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Thank you again, for offering this wonderful product! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rejuvinol is a unique nutrient-rich moisturizer that nourishes, tones and rehydrates for firmer, more resilient skin.  &lt;br /&gt;Your skin will be protected from oxidation (aging), sun and environmental damage. Rejuvinol contains Hyaluronic Acid, a naturally occurring substance in the body, it is one of the most effective moisturizing agents available. Rejuvinol really rehydrates your skin. This powerful, advanced anti-aging formula has recently been touted for its amazing anti-aging and moisturizing qualities. It reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and leaves your skin firmer, younger-looking, more vibrant and healthier.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enhanced with advanced anti-oxidants and skin vitamins, Rejuvinol(tm) nourishes, tones, and deeply hydrates for a smoother, more youthful appearance.This luxurious formula will help improve collagen health for increased strength and elasticity.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;RejuvoxPM Formula contains the universally recognized Argireline from Lipotec S.A. The active ingredient in Argireline is acetyl hexapeptide 3 (AH3), a deep penetrating, powerful amino peptide that helps to relax the intensity and frequency of facial muscle contractions.  Within minutes you&#x27;ll notice a \\&quot;lifted\\&quot; feeling after applying  our formulation to your skin. Argireline® also deters the degeneration of collagen/elastin, smoothes the skin, and reduces the depth of lines and wrinkles.  Remarkably effective on forehead, around the eyes, between the brows and around the mouth. I personally use it on face, neck and cleavage area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> For many women, wrinkles and fine lines are the an unforgiving reminder of the ravages of time. Looking into the mirror and seeing a face filled with wrinkles, weathered skin, and fine lines can be psychologically difficult to deal with, but it&#x27;s all a part of getting older, right? I will fight it every step of the way....without going under the knife! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> There is no use of this cream. I bought this cream and applying the cream for last one month but of no use, even not a 1% difference in wrinkles is there. It seems that I have wasted my money on such a product. I was thiking of recomminding to my friends also about this cream. But after seeing the result, I think they are lucky that they have not wasted their money</li>
    <li> In the three weeks my mother  has been a visible improvement in the vertical frown lines between her brows and also some of the horizontal lines on her forehead. While these lines are certainly not gone, they do look much better. This is particularly so for the lines between her brows which were quite deep to begin with. She has also commented that the texture of her skin (particularly her neck) has also improved. I am very excited about trying Rejuvinol!</li>
    <li> was gonna buy alphaderma but found Rejuvinol instead. Saved alot of money and got a much better product. i read alot of bad reviews on alphaderma and rejuvinol seemed to be the best out there for the money. the creams work great and my skin looks great! i can actually see the \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; getting smaller!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Rejuvinol for 5 weeks and the results have been surprisingly good. The lines around my mouth are not as visible and my overall complexion has really changed for the better. I am very happy with the product and will purchase it again for sure. Question. Do you offer coupons for repeat customers?</li>
    <li> I Been using the Rejuvinol skin care product for like 5 weeks and i am very happy. The lines around my eyes are gone and around my mouth too. My friends all think I had a secret makeover or something because their like how come you are lookin younger and everything. It works better than good and i am going to keep taking it.     Only thing is the UPS man left the package at the door and never rang my bell. The seller should tell UPS to not be doing that. It could of gotten stolen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve literally stopped using Botox because I don&#x27;t need it since I started using Rejuvinol and Rejuvox. I get the same results now I&#x27;m saving a ton of money!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Rejuvinol package for over $130. I have been using the creams for about four days but stopped because the cream is competely ineffective. I have purchased many high end creams over the past including Strivectin which is very good but expensive on a maintenance basis but Rejuvinol has to be the biggest disappointment of any purchase. I feel completely ripped off - the cream is dry and waxy on my skin and not the least bit moisturising. I hope I can save someone else a waste of their hard earned money!</li>
    <li> My friends and co-workers are convinced I&#x27;ve been using Botox and I&#x27;m having a hard time convincing everyone I haven&#x27;t been under the needle. My skin looks smoother and more tone. I&#x27;m so happy with these products</li>
    <li> I am 43-years-old and I have been using Rejuvinol for just a few weeks. After the first week, the results were \\&quot;take another look\\&quot; noticeable. I have surprisingly had so many compliments, \\&quot;You look rested, happier, younger looking\\&quot;. I also see the dramatic difference and I am very pleased with the appearance of my skin. Additionally, I am most grateful for the health benefits my skin is receiving from Rejuvinol. My deep forehead lines, deeper upper lip lines, crow&#x27;s feet, and laugh lines are very hydrated and have smoothed out dramatically. I have used so many products, searching for age-prevention for my skin and hopeful improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance, and finally, I have found this with your product. Thank you. I am so excited about trying your other products.</li>
    <li> As a professional model and make-up artist for over 13 years I have used everything on the market. After using AlphaDerma CE for the first time I saw and felt instant results. I think this is liquid gold! In fact, I cannot be with out it. I highly recommend AlphaDerma CE to all my clients and celebrity friends.</li>
    <li> I  just wanted to tell you that I was amazed at the results I had with the first few applications of Rejuvinol. I saw the commercial a couple of times. I got online to see where I could get this product. I tried it, and was amazed at the results I had in 10 minutes.  &lt;br /&gt;I have had Botox a couple of times and it was about time to have it again. Needless to say the expense was getting to be too much for me.  I cant believe how great the lines between my brows look! They have always been a major concern for me. They were getting deeper and deeper and I thought Botox was the only way to improve them. I called my sister in law the next morning and I told her about my results with Rejuvinol, and that I just couldnt believe it. She was the one who had me try Botox for the first time.  She called me a few min&#x27;s ago and said I just bought some!!. I told her to call me as soon as she tries it. I will continue to tell people about it. If I havent said it enough, its AMAZING!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I have been using Rejuvinol AM/PM twice a day for almost three weeks and have seen a significant overall improvement in the appearance of my skin. It has softened the fine lines around my eyes and forehead area, my skin has a much tighter and smoother appearance. I am 34 years old and tried many differant products to maintain youthful skin, this product appears to be working well. I also use botox, restyline and perlane and this product seems to enhance the effects of these injectables. I have also noticed more limitation in the muscle contractions in my forehead therefore minimizing appearance of lines. I am told I look 25 and would never be singled out as over being 30! That is reason enough for me to continue a preventative regimen including Rejuvinol and botox to keep my skin looking young and prevent future damage instead of trying to fix it later. Good Luck to everyone in their youthful search!  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I am very happy I found these creams here at Amazon. I was a bit skeptical at first reading the very immature reviews posted here. It seems as though some scorned competitor is doing his/ her best to write enough bad things to stray potential customers from buying. It&#x27;s actually pretty pathetic. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As for my own personal experience I can honestly say that these creams used accordingly did what they were meant to: freeze the topical layer of skin therefore relaxing the lines and giving the appearance of smoother skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Every lady over 30 should use these products. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As I enter my 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant change in the overall appearence of my skin&#x27;s tone, texture and color. I read about Rejuvinol on the web and it received very positive reviews. Since using it I&#x27;ve noticed a few positive changes and a a few I&#x27;m not so pleased with.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The product is marketed as a moisturizing, replenishing wrinkle relaxer and line corrector. The active ingredient is Argireline, which is supposed to have a similar effect to Botox by relaxing facial muscles. I have been using this product for the recommended 30 days. I&#x27;ve noticed the the appearence of fine lines in my forehead have reduced (although I haven&#x27;t noticed that the muscles are more relaxed). One other positive is that my skin feels much softer than it has in months. A noticable draback is that my pore size has increased, it is quite noticeable.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a good product overall. I would recommend for minor skin issues.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I hate buying face cream. There are so many products that cost crazy amounts of money and whenever I try to buy face cream I feel like I&#x27;m in a sleazy used car dealership and will end up being suckered in somehow. I don&#x27;t know if this stuff really contains ingredients that will help minimize the effects of aging, etc. But in my case, this stuff works. I bought it once when I was in a splurge mood after having read about it. My skin was pretty good. When it ran out, I switched to a drugstore brand and in short order - my skin looked terrible. I came back purchased another round of this and my skin looks great again and today, I&#x27;m back buying more. I also get microdermabrasian and will ask a dermatogolist for future recommendations and opinion on this.  But right now this is my preferred skin cream. Also just so readers now - I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and a smoker - so skin care is a concern for me but I&#x27;ve been told by many (including interns I supervise) that I look like I&#x27;m in my 30s - so I must be doing/using something right.</li>
    <li> saved hundreds of dollars by using the Rejuvinol AM/PM system and my face is as smooth and silky as ever!</li>
    <li> Ordered Rejuvinol on 9/14 and I recieved the product in 2 days. The on-line ordering process was easy.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with the Rejuvinol product because it has really changed the overall ruddy and dry complexion of my face, it has worked especially well in eliminating the wrinkly lines around my esyes. My mother and grandmother have the same problem so it is expected. The fragrance of the product is great because it is a light tangerine smell and it applies very light and non-oily.</li>
    <li> It took a little time and consistency to gain results with these products. My lines are still there but the have definately softened considerably. I was a heavy smoker throughout my 20&#x27;s and I have those stupid little lines around my lips that make me appear a bit more older than I am and I could kick myself for even having the nasty habit of smoking because it shows on my skin. As for these day and night creams, all I can say is I am seeing results even though the damage to my skin has been done I can&#x27;t afford plastic surgery and these have been the best thing I have found on the market to help aging skin.</li>
    <li> Although it has only been 3 1/2 weeks since using it, I wanted others to know that this product is just a fabulous formula! It is creamy, moisturizing, and really makes my skin look radiant and dewy. I have normal to dry skin, with some fine lines around my eyes and forehead, and was looking for a formula with all of the important antioxidants and peptides, but without fragrance and essential oils! Rejuvinol AM/PM delivers, and comes with 2 - 1.7 oz jars which is just a very smart business move on their part! I also feel like I am getting a quality product and not just buying a lot of hype! (translation: getting ripped off!). Thank you for making such great fragrance-free products! Plus it will be moisturizing enough to wear alone in the summer and has the benefit of an al day moisturizier! I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> For the past ten years I have had a problem with flaking near my nose and on my forehead. I have tried many different types of exfoliants to cleanse these areas. The result has always been the same. After application and drying, these area turn \\&quot;beat\\&quot; red....to the extent that I cannot leave the house. Instead of exfoliants, I have been using soap and water, then drying and applying a very liberal amount of moisturizer. However, no matter how little moisturizer I apply, within hours a slight crusting appears again.  &lt;br /&gt;Your Rejuvinol AM/PM product is amazing. Not only does it not leave me \\&quot;red\\&quot;....but it is self moisturizing without residue. My skin is smooth to the touch....problem solved. I also love the nighttime cream cause i wake up feelin nice and soft. &lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the product.....it really works.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Ce produit est I umbelieveable vraiment comme l&#x27;effet global qu&#x27;il a sur mon teint.  Je crois ?galement que le prix est bon en valeur le produit.</li>
    <li> I am in total bliss since finding these wonderful creams. I highly recommend this to anyone who is as self absorbed as I am about defying the aging process.</li>
    <li> Husband is a dermatologist and he recommends this to all his patients who do the Botox treatments. I just started using these creams myself.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;One of his patients is who first introduced this to him. She has been using Rejuvinol and Rejovox for over a year now and she praises them to no end. I was never the type of person to fight the signs of aging (probably because I never had to.....until now). I am now doing everything short of plastic surgery to not stop the signs of aging but to slow them down. My friends all spend tons of money on beauty products. These are the only creams I find worth spending on! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> The long and short of it: They get an A+ for clever website marketing and an F for professionalism and product effectiveness. It didn&#x27;t work for me nor did it work for any of my clientele who&#x27;ve tried it. I also found the personnel at this company quite unprofessional in my conversations with them (be sure to read return policy on this product). In lieu of both the high return fee and the obvious company-created reviews, it would seem not even they believe their product can stand on its own merit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whee to begin my praise regarding these creams. I love the immediate results I achieved when I started to use it. Everyone I recommended it to has nothing but great things to say about it. Thank you for taking the time to read my 5 star review. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I am 61-years-old and this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a product from the internet. I lost my husband 20 years ago and recently I&#x27;ve met a nice gentleman. I always looked a little younger than my years and kept my figure pretty nice. But I sure don&#x27;t look like a 20-year-old debutante. I never overly-fussed about my looks until I met had this new man in my life. I started shopping for new clothes and my daughter-in-law told me about this new product that was getting such good reviews for the skin. I had a couple questions for the seller and they seemed very nice. They assured me that many of their customers are \\&quot;older\\&quot; ladies and it had changed their life. It sounded like the fountain of youth to hear them tell it. I was so convinced that I bought 3 sets of the lotions(I received an extra one for buying 3). The first problem I had was that it was so drying and hard to put on the face evenly. My face felt too tight so I then added the normal inexpensive cream I use. I was persistent and used it day and night for almost 30 days. I wanted to make sure if it didn&#x27;t work I could still get a refund. But because I used the product, I could not get a refund. I don&#x27;t know what I will do with the extra sets. My son has a good business on the internet and warned me about methods companies use to make their products look more desirable and are able to get a lot of people to their sites using important sounding names. He sells medical supplies from a well-known company. I tend to believe the unhappy customers on here are telling the truth because I had all the same problems as they did. I guess I am mainly writing this to warn senior citizens on fixed incomes to please think hard before buying some of these products. My mother always used to say the best thing for the skin was to stay out of the sun and eat healthy foods. I wish I&#x27;d have followed her wisdom. I think inexpensive creams work just as well. That is all. I hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After reading so many very enthusiastic recommendations of the Rejuvinol products, I decided to order the AM/PM combo for myself to try. (Just for your info, I am 39 years old with very dry skin and fine lines.)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Immediately after using the products for the first time, I noticed a firming effect on my skin. Not only that, the products left my terribly dry skin feeling comfortable and not at all irritated. This impressed me enough to buy the other facial products that Dermalogics sells (Lumnaderm and Ocuderm). To my absolute delight, continued use of these products over the last 5 to 6 weeks has made what can only be described as a miraculous difference to my skin all over. Not only is it firm now, but the \\&quot;11\\&quot; lines on my forehead have completely disappeared and my other lines seem to be less noticeable already. My skin is smooth and clear. The red blotchiness I used to have has faded and the very few blemishes I now get are cleared up fast. And this effect lasts! Even if I miss my regime on the occasional evening when I apply fake tan to my face, the improvements are still maintained!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the first time in years, I feel comfortable enough with my skin to leave the house without wearing any make-up. I can&#x27;&#x27;t remember the last time it looked this good! My skin glows with health! Because I suffer from a form of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis, for which I have to take anti-inflammatory medication daily, my skin has suffered in the past - becoming very dry, dull and ashen. Dermalogics&#x27;s products have made a world of difference to me and given me back a lot of my old confidence. Over the last couple of weeks, people have even been telling me how great my skin&#x27;&#x27;s looking and if I&#x27;&#x27;ve been doing anything different to cause it to look that way. So, of course, I&#x27;&#x27;ve been recommending REjuvinol AM/PM to them all! Thank you for producing such brilliant products. I was a former sceptic about anti-aging skincare, but your company has changed my mind entirely. Dermalogics&#x27; products actually work! Your company can certainly count on my loyalty and I shall continue to spread the word about the amazing difference your products can make to skin. I really can&#x27;&#x27;t thank you enough. Please keep up the good work!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also have to laugh at some of these other reviews that are written by people who seem to all have the same \\&quot;agenda\\&quot;. I wonder if these reviews are from a disgruntled customer or a competing company? Either way they are so bogus its easy to see right through them. Enjoy Everyone &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I think the reviewer who suggested using the search option \\&quot;most helpful reviews\\&quot; gave some very good advice. These reviews tell a story other than the 4-star rating this product indicates. Unfortunately, this is not the only seller on Amazon using customer reviews to increase their own rating. This seller is just more blatant &amp; rude than most (see review below and several others).Amazon has a disclaimer on what is written in these reviews and is not responsible. However, I do believe it will have an indirect impact on their own reputation, as negative blog sites regarding Amazon are beginning to appear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;To the manufacturer: (which I assume is the Bodestore, because there is no information regarding a company called Dermalogics using any search engine. If the Bodestore would like to correct this, please do so. You have that option).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would like to offer you some friendly advice: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The concensus with the negative reviews (myself included--it had no effect for me) seems to include some or all of the following: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. The product does not contain enough moisturizer &lt;br /&gt;2. The product has no effect &amp; does not live up to its claims &lt;br /&gt;3. An exhorbitant return fee (indicating no faith in your own product) &lt;br /&gt;4. Customers are turned off by the wordy, clincial-sounding reviews posted repeatedly and also the insulting nature of many of your responses. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suggest that if you would direct your efforts into improving the product itself, conducting yourself in a more professional manner, and providing more clinical evidence than one small study; you will be much more effective in building a successful business. Buying up 100 domain sites will only work in the short-term. Your negative methods so far make you appear (I&#x27;m sorry to say)like a fly-by-night operation, inexperienced and rude. This unfortunately has a more global effect on other more reputable internet marketers. Companies like yours are the reason people are skeptical of buying any products off the internet and we are all hurt by it. Thank you.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is no surprise that we live in a youth-oriented culture. It &lt;br /&gt;seems that every year the standard of beauty to which we are all &lt;br /&gt;exposed and aspire, gets younger and younger at the same time &lt;br /&gt;that Americans are growing older.  Because of the emphasis in &lt;br /&gt;prevention and treatment of disease, the American Baby Boomers, &lt;br /&gt;those 50 and over, are healthier and more fit than people of the &lt;br /&gt;same age in previous generations.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They have the stamina, energy and prowess of people half of &lt;br /&gt;their chronological age.  This causes many \\&quot;Baby Boomers\\&quot; to &lt;br /&gt;exhibit an intense interest in procedures and techniques to help &lt;br /&gt;them look as young and fit as they feel.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is the point at which many Americans consider plastic &lt;br /&gt;surgery.  Signs of aging on the face are the most common &lt;br /&gt;symptoms causing people to seek out plastic surgery.  The four &lt;br /&gt;most common facial complaints are:   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Loose skin:  The areas on the face where we see loose skin most &lt;br /&gt;often are the jowls, the neck and the skin around the eyes.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fine Lines: Tiny wrinkles on the face increase in number with &lt;br /&gt;time and are more plentiful in lighter skinned people.  The most &lt;br /&gt;common sites are around the mouth and eyes but they can also &lt;br /&gt;develop anywhere on the face. These lines are made worse by the &lt;br /&gt;sun. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bagginess around the eyes: Loose skin is only one of the causes &lt;br /&gt;of bagginess around the eyes.  Additionally, small fat pads &lt;br /&gt;around the eyes can move from the top and sides of the eye &lt;br /&gt;region and end up resting beneath the eyes.  Shadows emphasize &lt;br /&gt;the problem and if there is any inherited darkening of the skin &lt;br /&gt;the problem becomes even more noticeable.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Exaggeration of Features:  As we age, some of our features &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;continue to grow.  Although the rate of growth is unperceivable &lt;br /&gt;year toyear, eventually, over time  we can see that there is an &lt;br /&gt;actual lengthening of our earlobes and nose.  Our brow may have &lt;br /&gt;lowered and there is an increase of fat below the chin, and in &lt;br /&gt;the fold between the nose and upper lip.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All of these complaints can be addressed through plastic &lt;br /&gt;surgery.  The success, risks and benefits differ depending on &lt;br /&gt;the areas of the face and neck the surgery is to correct, as &lt;br /&gt;well as other factors such as the age of the patient and the &lt;br /&gt;severity of the problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What is a facelift? The facelift is the classical surgical &lt;br /&gt;response to aging problems of the face and neck. In a facelift &lt;br /&gt;the skin is separated from the underlying tissue and pulled &lt;br /&gt;upwards and backwards.  The excess skin is them removed &lt;br /&gt;resulting in a lifting and tightening of the appearance of the &lt;br /&gt;skin.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are varying procedures that go deeper, some as far down &lt;br /&gt;as the layer adjacent to the facial bones.  Surgeons determine &lt;br /&gt;how deep to go with the procedure based on the needs of the &lt;br /&gt;patient, on a case by case basis. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What results can you expect from a facelift?: A facelift will &lt;br /&gt;lift the areas of your face that are sagging, such as your &lt;br /&gt;cheeks and jowls.  It will also tighten the loose skin on your &lt;br /&gt;neck as well as remove excess fat from under your chin and &lt;br /&gt;alleviate that \\&quot;turkey neck\\&quot; look.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What about scarring? The scars from a facelift can be &lt;br /&gt;extensive, although not easily detectable.  Scars will more than &lt;br /&gt;likely extend from above the ear, down the front of the ear, &lt;br /&gt;around the ear lobe, up the back of the ear, and into the &lt;br /&gt;hairline behind the ear. There can be another incision beneath &lt;br /&gt;the chin.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most scars from a facelift are hard to see once they heal. &lt;br /&gt;Scars can be camouflaged with make-up within three weeks and &lt;br /&gt;should fade beyond detection in one to three months. &lt;br /&gt;What complications can occur? Some of the complications that &lt;br /&gt;can result from a facelift are: Hematoma, Skin death; facial &lt;br /&gt;weakness or paralysis; attached earlobe (pixie ear) and open ear &lt;br /&gt;canal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What about lines and wrinkles? Although the results of a &lt;br /&gt;facelift and other facial plastic surgery can be dramatic the &lt;br /&gt;signs of aging that a facelift will not alleviate are wrinkles &lt;br /&gt;and fine lines on your face. Additional procedures such as Botox &lt;br /&gt;Cosmetic(tm), laser resurfacing, chemical peels and dermabrasion of &lt;br /&gt;the face are needed to address lines and wrinkle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Is there a safer alternative to facelifts and other invasive &lt;br /&gt;procedures?  Amazing advances have been made recently in topical &lt;br /&gt;preparations to combat the signs of aging. These topical &lt;br /&gt;preparations are a safe alternatives to many of the invasive &lt;br /&gt;procedures detailed above.  One such preparation is Rejuvinol(tm) . &lt;br /&gt;It is a unique nutrient-rich moisturizer that nourishes tones &lt;br /&gt;and rehydrates for firmer, more resilient skin.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What benefits can be realized from Rejuvinol(tm)?  Users of &lt;br /&gt;Rejuvinol have reported a 50-90% reduction in the appearance of &lt;br /&gt;fine lines and wrinkles within minutes of application.  They &lt;br /&gt;report that the product diminish the appearance of forehead &lt;br /&gt;creases, droopy brows, crow&#x27;s feet, furrows, laugh lines, &lt;br /&gt;feathered lips, and more.  Additionally, it reduces the &lt;br /&gt;appearance of acne scars, stretch marks, Rosacea, and enlarged &lt;br /&gt;pores. It gives skin a plumper, more youthful appearance &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What are the side effects of using Rejuvinol(tm)?  There have been &lt;br /&gt;no reported side effects of using Rejuvinol(tm). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rejuvinol is a non-invasive answer to the question of what a &lt;br /&gt;person can do to look younger. In most cases of fine lines and &lt;br /&gt;wrinkles, Rejuvinol is as affective as Botox Cosmetic(tm),  &lt;br/&gt;dermabrasion and chemical peels with none of the risk of  &lt;br /&gt;invasive surgical procedures and injections, at a &lt;br /&gt;fraction of the cost of these procedures. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> My friends all think I am lying that I did NOT get botox. The lines on my face are not as noticable. These creams work as long as you are consistent.</li>
    <li> STOP! Do not buy this product based on these bogus reviews.  They are all mostly authored by representatives/sales people of this company.  I have seen these same reviews word for word on nearly every other site that I&#x27;ve researched.  They are cut and pasted here in an effort to increase sales of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so unethical and I can&#x27;t believe that Amazon hasn&#x27;t caught on and rectified this situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google - research - educate yourself before being taken in by these inaccuracies and false &#x27;positive, miracle&#x27; reviews.  We all want the &#x27;fountain of youth&#x27; and they know it.. save yourself $100 and do some more research before purchasing.  Best Wishes..</li>
