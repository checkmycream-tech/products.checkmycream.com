      <li>I have not tested anything but the tweezers and I am glad I picked up a separate tweezers set from another merchant as these ones do not work very well.</li>

      <li>Needed stainless steel, because everything rusts in a marine environment.  </li>
      <li>The tools weren&#x27;t as sharp and the box didn&#x27;t close easily.</li>
      <li>Sheek and classy.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a decent set for the price.</li>
      <li>Wish the file was a little bigger but for on the go it&#x27;ll do just fine.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, the case, while nice looking, is going to rust.</li>
      <li>Only about half of the items in the case were secure in slot all the other stuff was just flopping around in the package.</li>
      <li>After putting everything back into place the case just barely closes.</li>

<li> Beutifull case, poor elements</li>
<li> I was actually shocked that they worked.</li>

    <li> I bought this set to replace the one I gave my sister.  This set wasn&#x27;t as nice though.  The tools weren&#x27;t as sharp and the box didn&#x27;t close easily.</li>
    <li> The box that the product comes had been torn and when I opened up the box some of tools came falling out. Only about half of the items in the case were secure in slot all the other stuff was just flopping around in the package. After putting everything back into place the case just barely closes. I have not tested anything but the tweezers and I am glad I picked up a separate tweezers set from another merchant as these ones do not work very well.</li>
    <li> Beutifull case, poor elements</li>

    <li> The brushed steel is very dry, almost feels powdery while holding. The cuticle clippers are soooooo tiny I was actually shocked that they worked. Overall it is a decent set for the price.</li>
