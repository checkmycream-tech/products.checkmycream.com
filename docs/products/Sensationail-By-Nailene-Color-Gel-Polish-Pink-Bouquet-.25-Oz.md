    <li> This nail polish lasts up to the two weeks!  I am thoroughly impressed!  I have tried another color too and it works great too! Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> On my toes and it still looks like I just did it. Use the product as directed but I have the Sally Hansen UV LED light and it works great. adjust timing to mach this product&#x3D;2 30 second hits to cure the polish and I double the time on the final clear coat (2x30 seconds) and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> This is my only gel polish that will chip within days of painting them. And when I put it under the led lamp it looks different than other gel polishes...</li>
