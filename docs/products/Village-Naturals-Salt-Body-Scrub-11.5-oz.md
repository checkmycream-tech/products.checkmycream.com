      <li>Village Naturals Salt Scrub is always just right.</li>
      <li>Plan to use it in the shower when you are going to scrub the tub and launder your towel right away.</li>
      <li>Only problem I would find with it is the need to clean the shower more frequently, although I would expect that to be true of any product that cleans with oils.  </li>
      <li>i bought both the salt and sugar scrub, and prefer the salt, just because i like the smell better, but both work equally well  </li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Only available online.</li>
      <li>And beware, after using it your shower floor may be oily and very slippery.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really put my finger on what the scent is though.</li>
      <li>It has such a rich oil which I like because I use it in the shower and don&#x27;t feel the need to use lotion.  </li>
      <li>While this kind of product usually cost upward of $20, this one is about $5 per jar.  </li>
      <li>The smell reminded me of sherbet ice cream and as much as I love that flavor, I don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like a little girl that just ate a whole tub of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing, the scrub does do the job.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I used it not only on my hands and feet but also all over body for instant smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my skin very soft.</li>
      <li>I already used my first bottle and had to get a second one.</li>
      <li>It leaves this gross film on your skin and it smells ABSOLUTELY NAUSEATING.</li>
      <li>Your skin will feel soft and moisturized after using this.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my skin soft enough that I dont need to use lotion for a few days afterwards.</li>
      <li>And it also makes the bathtub really slippery, so be careful.</li>

    <li> To get the best use out of this product, pour the oil off the top first thing.  You don&#x27;t need it. Plan to use it in the shower when you are going to scrub the tub and launder your towel right away. It&#x27;s great for a weekly spa treatment. A bit of work, though.</li>
    <li> i bought both the salt and sugar scrub, and prefer the salt, just because i like the smell better, but both work equally well  my husband used the salt on his face, even though i warned him not to, but it worked like a charm and scrubbed off a lot of dead skin without being abrasive  it gets messy if you&#x27;re trying to mix it in the shower, because the oil and salt separate when it sits, but if you have a bit of patience, you shouldn&#x27;t spill any</li>

    <li> The product might be great, but they need a new way to package it. When I received it in the mail, half of it was spilled in the box. The papers inside the box were soaking wet, and the containers of product were half empty. I bought it as a gift, but couldn&#x27;t give it. A complete waste.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with psoriasis for years. I have tried every medicated shampoo on the market, to include prescription shampoo&#x27;s. None of them worked. I did some research to find that I have underactive oil glands..so I decided to wash my hair with oil &amp; seasalts, followed by T-gel shampoo. AMAZING!!! The itching is gone &amp; so is the red rashy looking, scaly dry skin.  I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> paid $60 for basically same product at the mall.   Love the way scrub leaves skin soft and shiny.   And especially love the price.  Cant find it in any stores.  Only available online.</li>
    <li> This is the best body scrub that I have found for such a great price.  I used it not only on my hands and feet but also all over body for instant smooth skin.  Seller got it too me within a weeks time.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a product that makes you feel like you just got a Deep Sea Salt Scrub from a spa... (without the crazy cost of it)... this is it. Since the first time I used it, I loved it. It makes my skin feel so smooth and the smell is so soft.  I got so many compliments about how &#x27;healthy and glowing&#x27; my skin looked after using it.  I highly recommend.  This is becoming one of my fave products.</li>
    <li> This scrub is really coarse. You shouldnt use it after shaving, because it stings badly. And it also makes the bathtub really slippery, so be careful. I love how it makes my skin soft enough that I dont need to use lotion for a few days afterwards.</li>
    <li> This is the best body scrub I have ever found. Leaves your skin so soft and it is really a great price.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and feels so nice on dry skin in the winter.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This body scrub is great. I&#x27;ve only scrubbed my hands with it so far, but it is an awesome product. At first it feels kind of greasy after rinsing the salt away, however wash your skin with regular soap, and it will feel fantastic. My hands feel smooth and buffed. I can&#x27;t wait to shower with this and use it on my feet. It has a relaxing feeling as well, with a light scent. This would be great for a massage. I can&#x27;t really put my finger on what the scent is though. Almost like an orange-tangerine-clementine scent. The scent of it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin, but it leaves a fresh and clean smell. Sort of like when you leave the spa and have a light crisp scent on you. I really searched around for a decent body scrub for a good price, because I don&#x27;t have a whole lot to spend on it. I&#x27;m glad I came across this. I&#x27;m going to try their sugar scrub next.</li>
    <li> I have used a number of products of this type, and all are about the same in providing a great scrub along with great oils for the skin.  What is different about this product is the cost.  While this kind of product usually cost upward of $20, this one is about $5 per jar.  Great product for exfoliation and perking up dry skin.</li>
    <li> Item is as described.</li>
    <li> I love this scrub.  It has such a rich oil which I like because I use it in the shower and don&#x27;t feel the need to use lotion.  Keeps my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> I used this one time and threw it away! It made my shower slick and oily, and stirring it while wet was just annoying and i dropped it since it was slippery. It leaves this gross film on your skin and it smells ABSOLUTELY NAUSEATING. It smells like a creamcicle and i feel like i just jumped in a bowl of sugar and buttery fake orange artificial flavor. its not citrus at all, its like sherbert. IT IS NOT WORTH A PENNY.</li>
    <li> Smells and kinda feels like butter to the skin. Not too greasy either. Your skin will feel soft and moisturized after using this. I&#x27;m glad I tried this one out. Now I have a new regimen. :)</li>
    <li> I wanted a salt scrub that would do a good job but that was inexpensive.  This one fits the bill perfectly.  There is a light citrus scent which I like, the salt scrubs well and the oil is moisturizing but isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.  I already used my first bottle and had to get a second one. Only problem I would find with it is the need to clean the shower more frequently, although I would expect that to be true of any product that cleans with oils.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like it because:&lt;br /&gt;Every time I went to use it I had to mix it around. The liquid will be at the top. I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to mix stuff and when you&#x27;re in a hurry some will eventually spill out. It is too oily. It left my skin feeling dirty and sticky. If you don&#x27;t want that you need to use body wash after. So it takes a while. And beware, after using it your shower floor may be oily and very slippery. The smell reminded me of sherbet ice cream and as much as I love that flavor, I don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like a little girl that just ate a whole tub of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing, the scrub does do the job. I noticed some improvement on my rough arms but not enough to stick with the product. In the end, the cons outweighed the pros for me.</li>
    <li> This item was just fine when we used it.  We were able to find more locally and that is why we did not buy more.</li>
