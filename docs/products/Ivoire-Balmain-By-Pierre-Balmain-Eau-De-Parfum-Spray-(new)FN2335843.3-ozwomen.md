### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>A beautiful fragrance!</li>
      <li>Arrived as promised and is a beautiful fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Good for every day, both work and for going out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the fragrance, and it makes me feel good to have it on.  </li>
      <li>Very sophisticated and subdued.</li>
      <li>Love the smell!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>40.&lt;br /&gt;You can be 30 and still have good taste in clean elegant perfumes and Balmain</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t be sure</li>
      <li>I love walking through Bergdorf</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>Still, I love it and do not mind refreshing it during the day.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>As always, it is my favorite.</li>
      <li>If you like clean elegant fragrance you will love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Going to see about getting a refund as it smells too strong.</li>
      <li>Worth more than I paid for it</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know how original one smells</li>
      <li>It is unique, elegant, feminine but not too sweet, and very very chic.</li>
      <li>That said, I love the modern twist Balmain has put on this version.</li>
      <li>It is light and fresh and just so feminine.</li>
      <li>It is really good but not good enough for me to be perfect!</li>
      <li>but this is my new to go.&lt;br /&gt;For now one of my favorite together with Prada de Iris , Dsquared2  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking it was exposed to too much heat and light.</li>
      <li>Just the right combination of ingredients.</li>
      <li>This is a reformulated version launched only recently; it&#x27;s important to know that it is NOT the original 1979 scent.</li>
      <li>Old perfumes are better, and has a classic touch.</li>
      <li>but it is most definitely out of my price range.</li>
      <li>If you like woody powdery fragrances clean and soft this one is one of them!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Not the amazing perfume from the 1980s that this was meant to be a recreation of, but a easing scent none the less.</li>
      <li>Good price on hard to find product.</li>
      <li>Recommend it highly!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the new bottle - it is short, squat, more masculine looking than feminine and is a little more difficult to hold in one hand than the original bottle.</li>
      <li>I am a user of Balmain perfumes and have used Ivoire for years, Now they have decided to change the fragrance, put the same name and simply dupe the customer that it could be the same fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Shame of the House of Balmain for really destroying an amazing fragrance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not too heavy or sweet.  </li>
      <li>Possibly too old on the shelf.  </li>
      <li>I love it, but giving it a 4 star review due to the fact that it does not have a very lasting staying power, at least with my chemistry.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been wearing this for years.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Lasts long time.</li>
    <li> While I think this product was a decent value for the size, it smells a little off from the one I tested in the store. Checked to see if the product was expired but it seems up to date. I&#x27;m thinking it was exposed to too much heat and light. Going to see about getting a refund as it smells too strong.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and is a beautiful fragrance.  It&#x27;s packaging has been updated so it is the same perfume but looks newer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the fragrance, and it makes me feel good to have it on.  It&#x27;s a mood lifter for me.</li>
    <li> This one I think was defective.  Possibly too old on the shelf.  They are sending me something else by Balmain.</li>
    <li> It is really good but not good enough for me to be perfect!(( Sorry! Anyway, I recommend it for women after 40.</li>
    <li> This is a reformulated version launched only recently; it&#x27;s important to know that it is NOT the original 1979 scent. That said, I love the modern twist Balmain has put on this version. It is unique, elegant, feminine but not too sweet, and very very chic. I love it, but giving it a 4 star review due to the fact that it does not have a very lasting staying power, at least with my chemistry. Still, I love it and do not mind refreshing it during the day.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  Not too heavy or sweet.  Amazon was the only place that I could find this fragrance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the new bottle - it is short, squat, more masculine looking than feminine and is a little more difficult to hold in one hand than the original bottle. It&#x27;s been a long time since I bought my last bottle so I can&#x27;t be sure but I do agree with another reviewer who said the scent had changed. I think it&#x27;s a small change, not quite as floral, but I still like it.</li>
    <li> I cant believe that the House of Balmain has actually put this product on the market. I am a user of Balmain perfumes and have used Ivoire for years, Now they have decided to change the fragrance, put the same name and simply dupe the customer that it could be the same fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Shame of the House of Balmain for really destroying an amazing fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;If they couldn&#x27;t reproduce it, then they should have let it die, But Change It? That is unaceptable.&lt;br /&gt;I actually received this product as a mistake. The seller decided to substitute it. but in a way I am glad, because I can now give first hand  review of this very bad product.</li>
    <li> A beautiful fragrance! Discovered it in Bergdorf Goodman in NY. They were giving a spritz and some info about it as I was walking by . I could not stop sniffing my wrist , had to have it. I love walking through Bergdorf but it is most definitely out of my price range. However I checked on Amazon and voila there it was at half the price. It is light and fresh and just so feminine. Recommend it highly! Signed , Perfume Freak.</li>
    <li> Love it! If you like clean elegant fragrance you will love this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how original one smells but this is my new to go.&lt;br /&gt;For now one of my favorite together with Prada de Iris , Dsquared2  She Wood.If you like woody powdery fragrances clean and soft this one is one of them!&lt;br /&gt;And i disagree with one of the comment that this is for woman after 40.&lt;br /&gt;You can be 30 and still have good taste in clean elegant perfumes and Balmain is def. one! loooooveee it!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.  Get lots of compliments when I wear it.  Worth more than I paid for it :)  Would reccomend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Old perfumes are better, and has a classic touch.</li>
    <li> As always, it is my favorite. Understated elegance and sense of cleanliness and well being. Good for every day, both work and for going out. Just the right combination of ingredients. Very sophisticated and subdued.</li>
    <li> The scent is not what I expected. One of the scents in this fragrance is supposed to be patchouli, but there is not even a hint of the patchouli scent. I have been spoiled by another perfume that I&#x27;ve been using, but I wanted to try something different. I definitely will go back to what I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> Good price on hard to find product.</li>
    <li> Not the amazing perfume from the 1980s that this was meant to be a recreation of, but a easing scent none the less.</li>
