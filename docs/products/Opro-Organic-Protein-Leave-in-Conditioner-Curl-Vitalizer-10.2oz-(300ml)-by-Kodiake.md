    <li> This curl vitalizer is great for my hair.  It leaves my hair pretty smooth and also allows for it to be curly. It does leave the hair stiff.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Makes my curls look soft, bouncy and defined. Smells good too and keeps the frizz down. HOWEVER.... I found this for only $4.99 at Tj-Maxx.</li>
    <li> Hi there :) I had found this product at a local TJ Maxx for $4.99 and it is awesome! Its just what I had been looking for in a hair product.   After washing my hair I dry it to dampish then put some in my hands and scrunch my hair... I can tie it up in one of those \\&quot;messy buns\\&quot; and when it dries I take it down to find pretty waves and it smells great too :) It&#x27;s not oily or greasy at all.. i have LONG hair and i use about 4 pumps 2-3x a wk and its lasted maybe 4-6 months?  I also bleach/dye my hair often and this really helps in maintaining/regaining moisture..  The only thing is... Im running low and need more but I don&#x27;t wanna pay $13+S&amp;H when i originally got it @ $5.... I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores and this is the 1st place I&#x27;ve found since. I would def. buy this product if it was a decent price.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I have short curly hair ... It is magic.  I shower, rub in some Opro, 5 seconds of pushing my hair around to look good, and I&#x27;m out the door.  My daughter has very long hair and likes this product also ... no frizz.  And no nasty chemicals!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, and I&#x27;ve had a problem with it getting very frizzy. I bought this for $6.99 at TJMaxx, and everyday when I get out of the shower I use a couple of pumps, scrunch my hair with it, and half blow dry it with a diffuser. After it&#x27;s air dried the rest of the way, I&#x27;m left with the best curls I&#x27;ve ever worn. They&#x27;re soft, defined, and shiny.</li>
    <li> I use it every day and I&#x27;m 20</li>
    <li> it is a very good product, which works even for my VERY thin hair! For a long time, i could not find such wonderful product, because of my hair. I have no even small hint of the conditioner! I get light, clean and manageable hair!</li>
    <li> Love this deep conditioner! I used it for my daughters hair and it gives her a shine and softens her hair.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY NIECES  LITTLE ONE.  SHE FIRST FOUND A BOTTLE OF THIS AT GOOD WILL&lt;br /&gt;SO I LOOKED ON AMAZON  AND FOUND IT.  SO I  GOT HER A  BOTTLE.  SHE  SAYS TO SA THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS PRODUCT  IT MAKE HAIR COMBING  NOT SUCH  A BATTLE ANY MORE&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODCUTS</li>
    <li> Makes wonderfully soft curls.</li>
    <li> Good produce and I likely will by again, but it is somewhat expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with type 3b hair. My hair is soft fine and thin. It holds style well straight or curly. But my hair does not do products well. A handful of any product leaves my hair limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The natural texture of my hair is tightly curled but it will S curl or loop curl which gives me a runaway look. My hair also frizzes out of control. This product handled all my problems. It brings all my curls into one type adds shine and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair flat. It also so far has not caked up. My hair is soft and bouncy.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have found for my difficult hair. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or clumpy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sending this right back. What a trick. this contains artificial fragrances and parabens, which mimic estrogen and are known to cause breast cancer. Off it goes, back to the seller. I bought a product by Alba Botanica instead. I have been SUPER pleased with their natural and quality products.</li>
    <li> Applied this product to wet and dry hair, without any distinguishing results.  It&#x27;s very creamy and comes in nice bottle size, but no real shine nor detangle solution.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good value for your money and leaves hair soft and smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> Really healthy product</li>
    <li> Love this product and recommend that anyone with unruly or dry hair - might try this product.  I love the silky feel.</li>
