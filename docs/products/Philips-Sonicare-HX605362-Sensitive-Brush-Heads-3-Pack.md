      <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>My gums love me for this switch.</li>
      <li>It was believed that the harsher the bristles, the better the cleaning.  </li>

      <li>Feels great on my sensitive gums.  </li>
      <li>It was initially much more comfortable to brush with this brush head, and in a week or so the tooth sensitivity had cleared up.  </li>

      <li>brush heads are also nice and soft, clean effectively without having to use too much pressure, and my dentist has commented on the great results I have been getting.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to change the heads every 3 months or sooner according to the literature.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Senstive brush head snaps easily onto the Sonicare brush.  </li>
      <li>Love the Philips Sonicare Healthy White and these are excellent brush heads for those with sensitive gums.  </li>
      <li>The Sonicare is a wonderful little device that helps to clean teeth much more efficiently than a manual toothbrush.</li>
      <li>they work just fine, and that&#x27;s what you want them to do.  </li>
      <li>yes it sounds funny maybe but try it, you&#x27;ll feel fresh with good breath.</li>
      <li>So I now have a years worth of brush heads. :)</li>
      <li>Fantastic toothbrush,makes my mouth feel</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same brush head for about 4 months and it still works great.</li>
      <li>But, if you&#x27;ve found that you haven&#x27;t been comfortable using a Sonicare, try these heads out.</li>
      <li>I like how easy it is to keep clean.</li>
      <li>There is nothing out there that gets the job done like a genuine Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I feel I am doing more good than harm with these brushes rather than the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; heads that come standard with the Sonicare.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Oral B brushes for years, but these are far superior.</li>
      <li>Also good for directly brushing the gums.</li>
      <li>So far, it has held up good after about a month of service.</li>
      <li>The clean is thorough and I find I actually enjoy brushing.</li>
      <li>The new brush head fits nicely into the sanitizer which is part of the Sonicare Elite.  </li>
      <li>I also clean my tongue with this brush,</li>
      <li>My son billed it as getting teeth so clean</li>
      <li>The softness of the brush does not differ between the medium bristle brush in terms of how clean they get your teeth.  </li>
      <li>I have a clean bill of health.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These brush heads will still get your teeth plenty clean, but they&#x27;re softer.  </li>
      <li>I received these Sensitive Brush Heads to review and handed them to her knowing if she liked them, anyone would.  </li>
      <li>The softer brush is much easier on my gums and I can brush better with it.</li>
      <li>I really was pleased with these refills.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums so use a soft brush, my mouth is fresh and feels extrat clean using this combo, my gums are in better shape and my Dentist is very pleased with how things look.</li>
      <li>They really are softer on my teeth and gums and do the same great job cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These sensitive brush heads just make a fantastic product even better.</li>
      <li>brush heads are easier for me, shaped more like a regular toothbrush, than the circular small kind favored by Braun for example.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Sonicare&#x27;s new brush head is so much better.  </li>
      <li>brush heads are very good and soft but still do the job without being rough on the gum line.</li>
      <li>so always worth keeping an eye on.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>I use extra soft brushes and they work great.</li>
      <li>They are much more comfortable to use than the standard brush heads.  </li>
      <li>and, like me, is probably going to keep right on buying them.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m perfectly fine with the normal Sonicare heads.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t want to spend for the higher end Sonicare Toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy Sonicare offers this sensitive version of their brush heads as all teeth are not equal in sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Why didn&#x27;t these brush heads come with the Sonicare in the first place?</li>
      <li>The service was great, I received the product earlier than was expected, the brush heads were the exact ones I needed.  </li>
      <li>I have no problem with the regular Sonicare brushes, but this softer brush head is a nice alternative for anyone with sensitive teeth or gums.  </li>
      <li>ya should already have a positive opinion of them.</li>
      <li>But now I&#x27;m older and wiser and doing the right thing, but can&#x27;t undo the damage I inflicted on my gums.  </li>
      <li>Many people think that you need firmer bristles to clean your teeth, but actually, softer ones are better for your gums, and remove just as much plaque as firm ones with the added benefit of being able to bend and reach harder to clean spots better than the firm bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>but overall I&#x27;m reall satisfied and would highly recommend</li>
      <li>As any dentist can tell you, this can lead to gum erosion and less effective tooth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The hole in the brush head is too large for the vibratory shaft, resulting in abnormal noise during brushing.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good product. Just as ordered.</li>
    <li> These allowed me to get used to my new Sonicare toothbrush without being too rough.  Soft / sensitive and still really massages the gums and cleans teeth.  There is nothing out there that gets the job done like a genuine Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Most people brush HARD. Unconsciously, we scour like a scrubbing pad, pressing hard on bristles to get &#x27;em cleaner and brighter by sheer force, it seems. As any dentist can tell you, this can lead to gum erosion and less effective tooth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about it -- bristles are long, and when you press hard, you are cleaning your teeth with the stems, not the tips, potentially scraping away precious gum tissue! Therefore a softer bristle is better than a hard one. My oral surgeon advised that all of us should use a soft head brush, and hold it loosely in one&#x27;s hand vs. gripping it. This will lead to less gum erosion (and thus less sensitivity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the sensitive brush head, you will have less chance of \\&quot;overdoing it\\&quot; with your tender gums (which do not regenerate tissue or grow back---once you&#x27;ve eroded them, that&#x27;s it. Forever gone unless you get a costly gum transplant).</li>
    <li> I have liked the Philips Sonicare toothbrush ever since I was given one for Christmas a couple years ago.  My son billed it as getting teeth so clean \\&quot;you feel like you just came from the dentist,\\&quot; and I agree.  On a few occasions I&#x27;ve had to go back to a manual brush, and the difference is very noticeable.  I have no problem with the regular Sonicare brushes, but this softer brush head is a nice alternative for anyone with sensitive teeth or gums.  In my opinion, the only drawback to these and to the entire Sonicare line is the expense.  Anyone looking at these brushes probably already knows that and, like me, is probably going to keep right on buying them.  They&#x27;re that good.  (Be sure to look at your brush carefully before buying; there are different styles of Sonicare brush heads, and they are not interchangeable.)</li>
    <li> A huge Sonicare fan these sensitive teeth brushes worked as well as any of the other Sonicare brush heads we have tried. A bit softer than some by feel, I&#x27;m not sure these felt any different than a standard brush once on the vibrating Sonicare unit. They did a good job though and I have no complaints other than I&#x27;m not sure this speciality head is required to get the full benefit of Sonicare&#x27;s superior cleaning performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, these aren&#x27;t at all bad, but I&#x27;m also not convinced they would help anyone whose teeth are too sensitive to currently use the Sonicare system. Being a bit softer doesn&#x27;t ameliorate the vibration that is what makes Sonicare work so well in the first place, but could be a problem for those with a very sensitive mouth.</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t these brush heads come with the Sonicare in the first place? The Sonicare takes some care to get used to, and these brush heads would certainly help with the transition. They are quite gentle, while still ensuring you are getting a good cleaning. I feel I am doing more good than harm with these brushes rather than the \\&quot;soft\\&quot; heads that come standard with the Sonicare. Very pleased with these. We&#x27;ll probably be sticking with these for our brushes from now on.  Downside - price! I just can&#x27;t get over how expensive these toothbrush heads are. And why not make a 4 pack?</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth! I use tooth paste for sensitive teeth, the &#x27;sensitive&#x27; setting on my Sonicare--basically, whatever I can find to make brushing more comfortable, and my teeth less sensitive.  The bristles on this Standard Sensitive Brush are softer than the regular bristles, and it feels like I&#x27;m getting a good cleaning, without hurting myself. One more tool in my arsenal of sensitive-tooth care!</li>
    <li> Electric toothbrushes are better for your dental hygiene, and Philips Sonicare is a great electric toothbrush. It can also be an uncomfortable one, which is why it gives you settings that allow you to work your way up to the full Sonicare experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads solve that problem. If you&#x27;ve hesitated to switch to an electric brush, you can give up that hesitation.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare is a wonderful little device that helps to clean teeth much more efficiently than a manual toothbrush. The \\&quot;Sensitve\\&quot; brush heads take this a step further and minimize trauma to the gums. I am getting older, and have been told by my dentist to be wary of making gum recession any worse. With these brushes, there has been no worsening of this recession over the past 3 years.</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush,makes my mouth feel like I&#x27;ve just bin to the dentist and it&#x27;s super soft on my gums,the only drawback is the 2minute timer...I prefer brushing a little longer so I usually go for two rounds of brushing but overall I&#x27;m reall satisfied and would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare Elite, which has a small brush head.  Sonicare&#x27;s new brush head is so much better.  Feels great on my sensitive gums.  This new brush is softer than the original Elite brush head yet stiff enough to get the job done.  The new brush head fits nicely into the sanitizer which is part of the Sonicare Elite.  In the end, I don&#x27;t need a new toothbrush w/sanitizer.  I&#x27;m simply changing heads.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve used and tested quite a few electric toothbrushes over the years, and keep coming back to the Sonicare range.&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are easier for me, shaped more like a regular toothbrush, than the circular small kind favored by Braun for example.&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are also nice and soft, clean effectively without having to use too much pressure, and my dentist has commented on the great results I have been getting.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to change the heads every 3 months or sooner according to the literature.&lt;br /&gt;Most of us if we&#x27;re honest make them last longer, as they can be expensive. This 3 pack is pretty good value, I would like to see them do a 4 or 6 pack, as my wife and I change the heads at the same time usually, so a 3 pack usually means a double order.&lt;br /&gt;Occasionally these get on a gold box deal, so always worth keeping an eye on.&lt;br /&gt;For me, still the best toothbrush out there. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My husband has sensitive teeth and I switched the brush head of his Sonicare from the regular one to these sensitive ones. And he likes them especially with Sensodyne. I compared the bristles and they do feel softer on my hand than the regular ones. I&#x27;m happy Sonicare offers this sensitive version of their brush heads as all teeth are not equal in sensitivity. I will purchase again and definitely recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush, but I was cautioned by my dentist against using a hard brush. Enter these beauties. They really are softer on my teeth and gums and do the same great job cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare, but every once in a while I grudgingly have to go back to a soft bristle brush for a few days. That bit of gum between my two front teeth (on the back side) gets very annoyed with too much brushing. Every once in a while it feels like it has separated from my teeth after I brush, and it is PAINFUL. These brush heads are wonderful! I run the top point behind my front teeth and my gums stay right where they should.</li>
    <li> I used a Sensitive head with Sensodyne toothpaste to deal with some sensitive teeth.  It was initially much more comfortable to brush with this brush head, and in a week or so the tooth sensitivity had cleared up.  I recommend the Sensitive heads for brushing sensitive teeth, or anyone who just prefers a gentler brushing experience.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the DiamondClean toothbrush which came with a DiamondClean brush head, it seemed just a bit stiff for my taste, so i thought I&#x27;d try these sensitive type heads... Big mistake. They&#x27;re pretty decent brushes when still new, however they tend to wear pretty fast. Considering the ADA states that toothbrushes should be changed every 3 months, one would expect the toothbrush to last nearly that long before showing significant signs of wear. I purchased a three pack of these brush heads and four months later I&#x27;m on my last one desperately in need of a new brush head AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the DiamondClean series toothbrush head considering that brush lasted a full 2 months before I even started contemplating buying a new brush head.</li>
    <li> For the past couple years I&#x27;ve been purchasing these replacement heads from Amazon. The price from Amazon, especially with subscribe and save, is 5-10 dollars cheaper than the local store. Shipping is usually free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the sensitive brushes because of my delicate gums but that doesn&#x27;t mean they won&#x27;t keep your teeth clean. I brush once a day and every dentist appointment I have a clean bill of health. The Sonicare brush itself is better than other competitors.</li>
    <li> The finest toothbrush I have found its so amazing and dentist recommended too, found it at good deal too. Amazon makes life easy!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush product is easy on the gums and enamel  - we receive not only great checkups, but have healthier mouths!!  Great product and service -</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using different makes of electric tooth brushes and find using this Standard sensitive brush head along with the Sonicare HealthyWhite Power Toothbrush it&#x27;s the best for my teeth. I have sensitive teeth and gums so use a soft brush, my mouth is fresh and feels extrat clean using this combo, my gums are in better shape and my Dentist is very pleased with how things look. I also clean my tongue with this brush, yes it sounds funny maybe but try it, you&#x27;ll feel fresh with good breath.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a dental professional, but I&#x27;ve been reading up on the subject a bit and it seems as if softer brush heads are generally recommended by the professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads will still get your teeth plenty clean, but they&#x27;re softer.  If you have sensitive gums, or if you simply prefer a softer brush head, these brush heads should do the trick for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that I preferred a slightly firmer brush head, but I might just start using these going forward.  I&#x27;m a bit surprised that Sonicare didn&#x27;t offer these before.</li>
    <li> Saw all the reviews, ordered 2 packages. They don&#x27;t fit properly on brush and keep falling off! The channel inside is too narrow. I don&#x27;t understand where all these fake 5 star reviews have come from. DONT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!! Beware!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for Philips Sonicare HX6732/02 HealthyWhite R732 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush</li>
    <li> Great head without the harshness.  It&#x27;s very soft so if you have sensitive gums or a receding gums or your dentist just tells you you brush too hard, this is for you.</li>
    <li> Good product met expectations.</li>
    <li> The softer brush is much easier on my gums and I can brush better with it. So far, it has held up good after about a month of service.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  It is very soft and it does great cleaning.  Very happy with it and the results at my dental appointments.</li>
    <li> A great unit for the right price. Didn&#x27;t want to spend for the higher end Sonicare Toothbrushes. This one cleans your teeth thoroughly without buildup under brush head. I&#x27;ve used Oral B brushes for years, but these are far superior. I&#x27;ve been using the same brush head for about 4 months and it still works great.</li>
    <li> Great can on get them here and always reordered !! Sensitive brush heads are always the best way to protect your gums and your tooth enamel-- ask your dentist !! This is a mist for sonicare users :)</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase and it is a great value. I would highly recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> Teeth have never let cleaner.  Bristles aren&#x27;t as soft as I thought they would be so I go extra gentle when brushing my teeth. Maybe it will soften up after a few uses</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that my sonicare toothbrush came with a regular brush and was wondering why my teeth and gums had become so sensitive.  I needed to order a supply of replacement brushes for the future anyway, so I made sure to look for the Sensitive style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d like different from these, if if these Sensitive brush heads were made in compact size to fit my mouth.</li>
    <li> Actually is easier on the teeth and gums than regular brushes.  This is my go-to toothbrush. I have it on auto-order!</li>
    <li> This Senstive brush head snaps easily onto the Sonicare brush.  It feels soft on sore teeth and gums and I like that it is full-sized.  A very good product for those with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really not much to say about these brush heads - they work just fine, and that&#x27;s what you want them to do.  They are a little softer than the bristles on the regular Sonicare heads, but they seem to do a good job.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with sensitive teeth, thankfully, but I like how these feel anyway.  They are sturdy enough that my teeth seem to get clean, but I&#x27;m not worried about scraping all the enamel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
    <li> What kind of review do you need? It&#x27;s brush heads for Sonic tooth brush. If you&#x27;re buying replacement brush heads ya should already have a positive opinion of them.</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than they work well.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery, great price</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and gums, and these new brush heads were just the ticket! They are much softer and still work as good, if not better than the standard brush heads. Many people think that you need firmer bristles to clean your teeth, but actually, softer ones are better for your gums, and remove just as much plaque as firm ones with the added benefit of being able to bend and reach harder to clean spots better than the firm bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be purchasing again when I need a new set!</li>
    <li> A good and effective way to keep your mouth healthy.</li>
    <li> Love the Philips Sonicare Healthy White and these are excellent brush heads for those with sensitive gums.  They are much more comfortable to use than the standard brush heads.  Now if Phillips would only make sensitive brush heads in the compact size!</li>
    <li> Using this feels like wiping your teeth vanilla-soaked cotton. The clean is thorough and I find I actually enjoy brushing. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Makes brushing enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I have never purchased anything from Amazon and was in need of the Sonicare brush heads and decided to go onto Amazon to make the purchase instead of driving to the store.  I have been using the Sonicare for over 2 years now and was tired of going to the store and trying to figure out which brush head was the correct one.  The service was great, I received the product earlier than was expected, the brush heads were the exact ones I needed.  I will definately be using Amazon services again in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product based on recommendation from my dentist. The product is quiet,,and brushes very evenly. The automatic turn off after two minutes is a good idea.</li>
    <li> It was an OEM replacement for about half the price of our local store. So I now have a years worth of brush heads. :)</li>
    <li> Great stuff, can&#x27;t live without it. I will buy it again, although I might consider getting s softer brush next time.</li>
    <li> I have LOVED my sonicare toothbrush for years! Yet, since my teeth &amp; gums are sensitive, I&#x27;ve always had trouble using the Maxcare setting until now! These sensitive brush heads just make a fantastic product even better. I can also use the massage feature that before, was just a little too rough with the standard brush heads. These are soft enough to allow me to use the strongest settings but still not hurt my gums/teeth.</li>
    <li> The dentists recommended my wife use a Sonicare several times over the years.  She&#x27;d always use it for a while then quite because she has sensitive gums and the vibration from the SonicCare along with the pretty firm heads just were more than she could handled.  I received these Sensitive Brush Heads to review and handed them to her knowing if she liked them, anyone would.  Well, she loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m perfectly fine with the normal Sonicare heads.  But, if you&#x27;ve found that you haven&#x27;t been comfortable using a Sonicare, try these heads out.</li>
    <li> item is as described. Ordered to replace old brushes</li>
    <li> I have been using the sensitive brushes for years and always get rave reviews from the hygenist and dentist.  They always comment on my great home care and tell me to keep it up.  These bristles, while softer than most, give me a great cleaning without harming my gums.  I&#x27;ve had a problem with gum recession all my life and I attribute it to the brushes I used when younger.  It was believed that the harsher the bristles, the better the cleaning.  But now I&#x27;m older and wiser and doing the right thing, but can&#x27;t undo the damage I inflicted on my gums.  Do yourself a favor and use softer brushes to prevent gum recession and make sure your young children do the same.</li>
    <li> A part of a very good toothbrush. I like how easy it is to keep clean. I use extra soft brushes and they work great.</li>
    <li> I love my Philip Sonicare toothbrush and brushes. I will never go back to a regular toothbrush; is just not the same.&lt;br /&gt;This brush heads are very good and soft but still do the job without being rough on the gum line. Your mouth will feel as it you just left the dentist office from a cleaning. Give them a try!</li>
    <li> The Sonicare tooth brush is a way to get a nearly dentist-clean feel (no bs--your teeth get the squeaky-clean feel.) These brush heads are nice in that they have the \\&quot;wave\\&quot; profile that helps get the tip in tight spots near gums, but I like the diamondhead version better because the brush gets wider in the middle with a narrow tips vs the ovular shape of this brush head.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tooth brush. Gentle on the teeth and gum.&lt;br /&gt;But it does not last for 3 months. The best I can get out of it before I have to&lt;br /&gt;replace it is 1.5 months.</li>
    <li> The softness of the brush does not differ between the medium bristle brush in terms of how clean they get your teeth.  Quite effective! My gums love me for this switch. I really was pleased with these refills.</li>
    <li> Great replacement head. I love the indicator stripe on the brush head that reminds me when I need to replace it. I would never remember without it!</li>
    <li> gentler than original/regular brushheads,  but just as effective at cleaning.  much better bargain here than at the drugstore or elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Have used the Philips Sonicare for years. Always order the sensitive heads online because they are not typically stocked in stores. However, the manufacturer&#x27;s qualty control on the last batch was sub-standard. The hole in the brush head is too large for the vibratory shaft, resulting in abnormal noise during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this is a one time issue.</li>
    <li> I immediately switched to this sensitive head. It allows me to clean slightly under the gums without fear. I am elated by how well these work.</li>
    <li> I actually like this product. It definitely lessens the brushing harshness that can be a part of brushing with an electric toothbrush. The price, regardless of where you can purchase it, is excessive.</li>
    <li> Works well with my sensitive teeth. Also good for directly brushing the gums. I recommend this for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Do not know how long this brush will last, but seems to be doing fine. I liked the feel of it and think it is a bit easier on my teeth alright, my last brush was too hard on my gums. They started to recede, this one does not seem to recede gums, but doubt that the brush will last long, built a little less quality than the regular brushes Phillip provided.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say - as promised.</li>
    <li> Great for those who brush too hard or have sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment, thank you, I like these heads better than all the other sonic care heads, the other ones are very stiff and aggressive, these clean very well and if your teeth are sensitive..these are a must have, great product with great results</li>
    <li> Good replacement brushes for my Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Disappointed with the noise that came out of using one of these. The other two seem okay, but not like the originals that came with the base.</li>
