      <li>I used tingle tanning lotions for years now and for the longest time I haven&#x27;t had a good one that has a \\&quot;burn\\&quot; to it.</li>

      <li>I have been using Ed Hardy Coconut Kisses tanning lotion, and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Friends had good experience with tingle lotions</li>
      <li>Good luck</li>
      <li>As a fair skinned girl, I started tanning with Ed Hardy Hollywood Bronze.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using tingles for years and decided to give this one a shot since I heard good things about it.</li>
      <li>I wish I wasn&#x27;t allergic because this gives really great quick results and smells good!</li>
      <li>I think its best to start off with some tingles that are mild and then move up to this.</li>
      <li>It smells good abd goes on smooth!!</li>
      <li>It has a very hot tingler in it and the bronzers great!!!</li>

      <li>Fade Protection is my favorite bronzing!</li>
      <li>and I love it !</li>
      <li>It reminds me more of a body lotion scent, which is pleasant to remain on your skin, rather than a chemical/floral after tan odor.</li>
      <li>This stuff is SOOO HOT!!!!</li>
      <li>and i get amazing color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got it in a few days but it left my skin blotchy, and red. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to buy this until you get a base tan.</li>
    <li> The only way I can explain this lotion is a tanning lotion on steroids! Never have I experienced a lotion quite like this, the very first time I used it I had instant results. And I only have to tan once a week and it takes almost two weeks to start notice it fading. However only use this if you have used tingle in the past and if you have a base tan already!</li>
    <li> Great lotion, but VERY HOTT!!!</li>
    <li> I love tingle lotions.Although I am not crazy about the after smell it gives me great dark tan and the price is really great.I will oder this lotion again.fast delivery from this company</li>
    <li> I love body shots. Don&#x27;t use it unless you like extreme tingle. And heat. I try to mix up my lotion. So I have to find something hotter. But you gotta try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning on and off for 4 years and I never found a lotion that got me to the level of darkness that I wanted to go.  Before I used Body Shots, I had a REALLY good base tan, so for those who do not have a base tan I would not recommend this product. I&#x27;m immune to tingles. I can&#x27;t feel a thing. It&#x27;s unfortunate because I was scared to try this lotion because everyone was saying it&#x27;s going to feel like my skins on fire!!! But when I got in the tanning bed I could not believe it....I was not feeling a bit of tingle!!! But lemme tell you.....within HOURS you WILL notice a huge difference in your skin color.   I believe that maybe because I have a good base tan I don&#x27;t feel the tingle, but if you want to take your tan to the next level I highly recommend this lotion!!!!  Not too crazy about the smell, but your tanning, youre not gonna smell like a basket of roses.</li>
    <li> I started off using this lotion twice a week for my tanning sessions.  I was as dark as I was over the summer when I was tanning everyday with a regular non-tingle non-bronzer.  HOWEVER, my hands turned orange no matter how much I cleaned them.  I used baby wipes that are offered in my salon to try and clean my nails and hands before I got in the bed.  It didn&#x27;t help at all.  After about 3 weeks I realized the color I was getting was a lot more orange than it was brown or red.  If you are looking to get fast color for an event this is a great product.  I would recommend buying the packets instead of the bottle though.  It&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re going to want to use regularly.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, was using the obnoxious before and im glad i stepped up to this one. Tungle nice and warm and i get amazing color. Wouldnt recomend unless experienced tanner.</li>
    <li> Too much tingle!  Works all day.  Bought all the others. Love them.</li>
    <li> Awsome lotion strong tingle</li>
    <li> I love it and will continue to buy ed hardy product. you the best. have found other things I am pleased with</li>
    <li> This is a very hot tingle!  More than one of my favorites \\&quot;Bombshell\\&quot;. So if you aren&#x27;t used to tingle,  you may start with something else.  I love this this lotion.</li>
    <li> If you like tingles this one is good. I am very experienced with tingles so I found this one to be a bit mild. But I&#x27;m sure others would disagree. It had a pleasant smell. Not my favorite lotion, but it was good.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell, and if u like tingle you will love this. Although I didnt care for The bronzer in it, I noticed that the palms of my hands were orange\\&quot;ish\\&quot; after laying so I don&#x27;t use it that often.</li>
    <li> Love it will order again soon. It smells soooooo goooood would almost use it just as lotion if it didn&#x27;t tingle</li>
    <li> Ed Hardy should have named this lotion \\&quot;Addicted.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s great!  What most lotions take 15 tanning sessions to do, this does in one.  Very strong tingle, so I would not recommend if you do not like the hot tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and I like trying new lotions regularly and I tried this one and I love it! The tingle didn&#x27;t bother me like I expected it to, but it still made me rather red for a couple hours. This is probably one of my favorite lotions and I highly recommend it if you like tingle and want a sun kissed looking tan. Ed Hardy makes amazing lotions so even if Body Shots isn&#x27;t for you, try something else Ed Hardy!</li>
    <li> hands down the best tingle lotion out there! after the first use I could already tell a deeper darker tan to my skin than I would get when I used other lotions</li>
    <li> i seriously think that the lotion was fake and had fake tanner in it..did not feel any kind of tingle and my hands would turn orange after every time I used it and even after bringing wipes for my hands they still would get orange.. I feel like i would get tan but after a shower I was much lighter.</li>
    <li> I have used John Hardy for a long time.  I have a good base, so I don&#x27;t get red or burn at all.  I do feel slight tingling , but nothing major.  FYI.. It will stain your hands a little on your palms etc. so wash or wipe off before tanning.  But I still highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> First off im gonna say i tried A LOT of tingle lotions for the past month and a half. I started out with pink diamonds (very low tingle, best for beginners), then i used jwow Mad hot, got slighty dark but nothing dramatical, then i used Risque Ritual and its ok but yet again, nothing dramatical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally bought this and it was worth every single penny! This is only my 2nd time using this and its the best tanning lotion if you want really dark results. The tingle is a little high so u must have a base tan and try other lower tingle lotions. But i love this tingle! I felt like i was in a sauna in the tanning bed. The tingle is hot but relaxing :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is OK, nothing great but not bad. Smells a little like citrus and smells like just an ordinary lotion. But thats alrights with me, i dont have complaints about the smell, its very mild anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from like a medium tan to a VERY dark tan in 2 sessions! Wow, and the bronzer in it never stained my clothes (i even wrote a white shirt and its still clean!). This is deff a MUST have if u want a DARK tan. All my other tingle lotions slowly got me dark but this one worked instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As i said, you must a experienced tanner to use this. I think its best to start off with some tingles that are mild and then move up to this. Otherwise if might overwhelm you. This is my #1 fav tanning lotion, and #2 being designer skin &amp;#34;bombshell&amp;#34;.  HIGHLY reccommend if you want to get darker :)</li>
    <li> First, I can&#x27;t comment on if this one (off amazon) is the real deal or not as I bought it from the salon I go to.  This left me red, tingle wasn&#x27;t too strong to me, but it definitely has a LOT of bronzers in it, which I love.  Just be careful wiping your hands after applying, be sure to wipe off any on your palms and between your fingers.  Pay lots of attention to putting it on evenly because if you don&#x27;t then the bronzing effect is splotchy, I speak from experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:  If you wear this to tan be careful with touching people for a few hours after.  About an hour after I tanned I was around my daughter, so of course I picked her up with out thinking and next thing I know she&#x27;s bright red everywhere my arms and upper chest area had touched her.  She&#x27;s too young to talk, so I don&#x27;t know if it hurt her, but I put her in a COOL bath and washed her really good.  Then put on a long sleeve shirt that covered my arms and up to my collarbones so there wasn&#x27;t anywhere that would touch her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr: Great lotion, didn&#x27;t buy from amazon, spread bronzer evenly, careful when touching others after using product.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this lotion after finishing my bottle of Designer Skin \\&quot;Betrayal\\&quot; and could not be more pleased. This lotion blows Betrayal clear out of the water! This is the most intense tingle I have ever used so if you&#x27;re a beginner tingler I would say hold off on it! But the results are out of this world and are well worth the 2 hours of redness you get afterward. The bronzers are excellent, a little orangy so make sure you wipe your hands after applying it but they complete the tan. It has a really nice orange-citrus candy scent. Best lotion I have ever used and I have tried all the expensive brands! This lotion does not disappoint!</li>
    <li> Before I Even begin to explain my experience with this product, I would like to state that I would only reccommend this lotion for EXPERIENCED tanners, who have used tingle in the past.     This is the STRONGEST tingle i have ever used in my life. My skin was still irritated 1 hour after applying the lotion. The bronzers in this lotion are surpeme, and the ATO is a delicious citrusy smell.     If you want a DARK tan, and dont mind the EXTREME tingle, then I would highly reccommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought and used a sample of this lotion today and WOW what awesome results!!  I love tingles and was looking to see if I could find a product that was hotter than Goddess and Insanely Black,other tingles that I use and love, but I was curious if there were other products that deliver the same or better tingle results so I tried Ed Hardy Body Shots.  This lotion is intense.  I will definitely buy a bottle of this lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using tingles for years and decided to give this one a shot since I heard good things about it. It deffinately is the hottest tingle I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, just give that itchy, sun burn feel. The bronzers in it are great. They deffinately boost your tan. I wouldn&#x27;t use this lotion every session though as it started to make me look orange. Has a very nice citrus smell to it and goes on smooth. Not too greasy.I will most likely buy again when the bottle runs out, however I still am leaning towards the Bombshell lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it worked really well.  I was very impressed and feel it is one of the best I have used.</li>
    <li> I am an experienced tanner, I like tingle lotions so I thought I&#x27;d try this one after reading the reviews. In the bed, it didn&#x27;t burn all over, just mostly my legs and yes I used it on my face (personal preference, I know it can be dangerous) but yeah my face got hot, as hot as it was (hottest I&#x27;ve tried but not completely unbearable) I wasn&#x27;t all that red afterwards, I was at least a shade darker when I left the tanning salon and within a few hours I was the DARKEST I&#x27;ve ever been, and Ive tried all the well known lotions, the ones on they say are the best of the year etc so I&#x27;ve been pretty dark but never this dark! It gave beautiful color! My only disappointment was that my color didn&#x27;t last but a day and a half- 2 days, but ill definently keep using this lotion, its amazing! Keep in mind though I did not buy from Amazon, I ordered a sample packet from ebay, which of course was sealed, so I know it was real. Good luck though, anyone buying bottles off amazon, I really hope you get the real body shots lotion because its absolutely one of the BEST tanning lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> I am a very experienced tanner, having tanned off and on since I was 16 (I&#x27;m now 33). I&#x27;ve used a lot of different lotions and even worked in a tanning salon for a while.   With that said, I&#x27;ll offer a warning to those of you who have never tried this: It&#x27;s intense. It should only be used by the most experienced tanners, particularly only those who have used tingle products before. Do not apply this in any sensitive areas, including your face.  I tanned with this (it was gifted to me as a sample) yesterday about noon. It was late into the night before the redness and burning of my skin subsided, and even a day later, I&#x27;m still sore to the touch and my skin is itching. I suspect I&#x27;ve had an allergic reaction.  If you use this lotion, beware! Use a small amount only! And if you&#x27;re a newbie, perhaps you&#x27;d be better off trying a different brand!</li>
    <li> So I work at a salon and am always looking for new lotions to try. Tingles are my absolute favorite so I was super excited to try it out. Got to my house in just 2 days so that was awesome. I used it the next day and I have to tag along with many of the other reviewers, this is an INTENSE tingle. I would not recommend it for beginners at all!! Like I said before, I love tingles and am pretty experienced with tanning so I was fine with the intensity. However, I do think there&#x27;s an ingredient in this that I am unfortunately allergic to :( I am going to do some comparing to my other tingles and see what&#x27;s in this one that isn&#x27;t in others because 3 days and multiple showers later I am still itching on my legs :( I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I would definitely not recommend this to people who do. I wish I wasn&#x27;t allergic because this gives really great quick results and smells good! Just be prepared!</li>
    <li> WARNING  this product has an extreme tingle.  So if not prepared for it you will want it off your body as soon as possible and some skin areas would not be suited for this to be used on period.  Too Much Tingle.  Will not use again.  BE WARNED</li>
    <li> I used tingle tanning lotions for years now and for the longest time I haven&#x27;t had a good one that has a \\&quot;burn\\&quot; to it. I think if you can&#x27;t feel it it isn&#x27;t working and it&#x27;s 100% true. This stuff is SOOO HOT!!!! I can see the difference in my tan once the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; wears off. LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Gauranteed to buy again!</li>
    <li> Do not buy! I have used Body Shots for over a year now and have even bought from this seller before. However upon opening this bottle the smell and color were different. While tanning I received no tingle sensation and had no color afterwards. I immediately contacted the seller and they were extremely rude telling me I was ridiculous. I was offered only a 50% refund minus shipping. The amount was so little I did not even bother. I am very disappointed with the product and customer service. I recommend you to never buy from this seller. You never kno what you will get.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome! Gets you dramatically darker in the first use! And the tingle factor is enough to set your soul on fire!</li>
    <li> This is the hottest tingle I&#x27;ve tried in a long time and I get unbelievably good results.  I get so dark using Body Shots.  It is super hot!  Smells nice before and after tanning.  There is no stinky after tan odor.  Beware using this if you have kids and pets.  I have to always wipe down any chairs I&#x27;ve sat in or things I&#x27;ve touched after using this.  Always wash your hands well after using this.  Do not apply to your face as it could cause tiny capillaries to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product but use with caution!</li>
    <li> Okay so let me start off by saying this was the first tingle lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It warns to test it if not used to extreme tingle lotion so I decided to put it on all of my legs from the thighs down. I went into the tanning bed at 430 and tanned in a 20 min low pressure bed. after about 5 mins I could start to feel the tingle and the sensation lasted until 2:30 am when I fell asleep.. I woke up in the morning and my legs were several shades darker than the rest of my body. I would beware using this if you have little kids because I picked my daughter up and she broke out with red blochy patches all over that itched/burned her badly until I bathed her. Bath yourself before you have contact with other people esp children. Bottom line: this is a great smelling, smooth spreading, extreme tingle lotion that leaves your body golden brown like you just got back from the beach!!</li>
    <li> love it most amazing  tingle ever! good tan! perfect for chilly dayz! hope you love it as much as me! i lovve the ed hardy line! 2012 Ed Hardy Black Elixir Silicone Bronzer Tattoo Fade Protection is my favorite bronzing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sizzle lotion addict and this is by far the hottest and most effect sizzle and bronzer on the market. My tan looks natural and I feel great about myself!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about buying this product, I know of alot of places who sell &amp;#34;discounted&amp;#34; lotions as a sale, but are really a fake lotion in an expensive bottle.. but.. I read alot about this product and it seems to be the real deal. The tingle was not as hot as I expected, but it was HOT believe that.. lol. I am a very experienced tanner. I normally use Designer Skin&#x27;s - Bombshell Tingle Bronzer, but I wanted to try something new since I have been using that product for a year, my skin becomes &amp;#34;immune&amp;#34; to it and you don&#x27;t tan as well.. which is why alot of salons or experienced tanners will tell you to switch it up time to time. So, I bought this with high expectations being I read all the reviews.. Now.. the lotion itself, the smell isn&#x27;t strong, the after smell isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pleasant&amp;#34; to most, but I&#x27;m weird and I like the after smell of the lotion on my skin. I was beat red after I got out of the tanning bed which mad me happy because then I know it worked, and that it wasn&#x27;t expired. I was a little worried and not too happy to find that the next day (today) after tanning, it seemed as though it worked like a &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; lotion would.. or a spray tan.. if you know how those are you may know what I mean when I say there were some blotchy spots, if you do not rub this in ALL THE WAY and perfectly, you will have some silly spots.. but for the most part, it gave me GREAT color, which is all I cared about because since I am fairly pale right now and working to get my tan back, I dont expect my tan to look that great with a black bronzer.. Of course i&#x27;m going to get iffy results.. but once I get darker, I know this lotion will work wonders for me. I love the price, fast shipping.. overall I am still pleased with this product!! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of various tanning lotions, brands, different tingle levels, tried formulas - including mixing some bronzers and maximizers with others to enhance color and moisture for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will undoubtedly claim thus far this is the most &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; a lotion has ever felt on my skin. Normally all the tingle/hot lotions are warm, cause some redness, but I never feel the intensity others (and the product) say it gives. I am a highly experienced tanner, and with naturally olive skin tone plus Native American heritage, I tan incredibly easy and fast. This doesn&#x27;t always work in my favor. I tend to hit the tanning plateau often, and am forced to mix up bulbs and lotions to keep seeing the darker and darker results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a lovely scent. It can seem powerful, but it stays &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; smelling, even after tanning. It reminds me more of a body lotion scent, which is pleasant to remain on your skin, rather than a chemical/floral after tan odor. I may not feel the heat of this lotion as intense as others, but I accept this is my tolerance and not the fault of the product, I get the results it is intended for! A deep, dark red that fades into a golden, glowing brown color is what it gives me every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this lotion only three times now, as I recently received it in the mail, but I tan often. As with anything - I expect to have to take a break from this and use a bronzer for a week, and then return to this, and repeat, to continue the results. This, again, is not the fault of the product but how the human body naturally builds a tolerance. This has been my new favorite hot lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who wants results, but perhaps this lotion could be too hot, try Glamour Goddess by Designer Skin. It has a coconut lime scent, ingredients similar to  Body Shots that help moisturize your skin, and delivers beautiful color. It was my previous favorite hot lotion until I tried a sample of Body Shots and purchased the full bottle.</li>
    <li> I received this on Saturday and used it for the first time that day .... this is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve used the tingle didn&#x27;t seem that strong but after you get out and the redness goes away I was unbelievably dark! I will definitely be ordering again !!!</li>
    <li> I love my new lotion! It works great. It exceeded my expectations. I will continue to shop with them and their great prices.</li>
    <li> Although this lotion nearly made me pass out, I loved the smell. I have now learned to mix it with another lotion that contains no tingle.</li>
    <li> This product is out of this world. This is the best dark tan I have ever gotten in a short period of time. I will only use this for now on.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of tingle but this product sets me on fire and I cannot wait to get home and wash it off.  Then I itch the next day after being washed off.</li>
    <li> Loved the lotion as it helped achieve a darker richer tan, however would recommend using gloves to apply as the lotion stains between your fingers!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this Lotion. I have used MANY tingles, as I use my Tanning bed almost daily, but Body Shots, has got to be my favorite tingle lotion that I have ever used. It is extremely HOT, no joke!. So if you have never used a tingle, don&#x27;t use this one first, ( I suggest using Swedish Beauty;s Pink Diamond tingle to start with, also gives AMAZING COLOR, still use it sometime for that color boost.) But Body Shots gives such a beautiful bronze brown color, after first getting outta the tanning bed, I do have that red tingle effect color, but unlike other tingles, it;s not Lobster red, its more reddish brown. The tingle feeling effect does last a little longer then some other&#x27;s i have used, but to me that isn&#x27;t a problem, as long as I see results, and with this I do, the color from this lotion is just amazing &amp; the color lasts longer then what most other tingles will.. I Haven&#x27;t had any problems with streaking or any orange coloring. But I also make sure I take my time to rub it in evenly, &amp; always use a paper towel to wash my palms, any tanning lotion with bronzer in it will turn your palms that funky color, but a paper towel &amp; little water, will prevent that from happening. I LOVE THIS LOTION, without a doubt will keep buying this lotion and keep it in my rotation. I bought it from Todays Couture and it arrived soo fast, &amp; they are who i will be ordering from again :)</li>
    <li> Great price and works great will be back to buy more when the time come to reorder. Great tanning product it does have a serious tingle factor</li>
    <li> Think product was old only used twice no tingle !think maybe it sat in warehouse where the climate was not controlled!!will not ever order from them again</li>
    <li> I have been using Ed Hardy Coconut Kisses tanning lotion, and loved it.  Was looking for something with a little more umph... so I purchased the Body Shots and couldnt be happier with it!!!  It tingles without being overly hot... takes just seconds before you feel it working!  Has given me a nice even tan, and never turned my hands orange as I saw other people complain about.  If you are not experienced with tinglers, I suggest you skip this lotion.  It is not for the inexperienced.  Love it and will continue using it, and will end up buying this again!</li>
    <li> Great Price, item was exactly as described and arrived quickly. It save me the trouble of having to travel to a shop or tanning salon to pick it up.</li>
    <li> Sure it works well as a tanning lotion (For my boyfriend 37 who had already been tanning for a while). He claims he felt no burn. However if you come in contact with anyone sensitive to tingle it will burn them bad. First after returning from a tan by boyfriend and I snuggled up briefly and in turn that caused me a tingle burn on my face and arm. Hours and I mean HOURS later- My son rubbed up against my boyfriend (rough playing as boys do) ended in my son being covered across his face in a tingle burn that is horrible that also caused raised skin bumps where the burns are. It has been ten minutes and he is still red. I have no clue how long this will end up lasting but I am very upset. Someone should have made a disclaimer on the bottle or advertisement that there is a possibility of the product lasting long enough on the skin to harm others.</li>
    <li> my favorite and I&#x27;ve been tanning several years,  don&#x27;t care much for the tingle but it&#x27;s worth it to me.​</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good product.  I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of it, but does the job as far as tanning is concerned. Just something about the smell is a turn off to me.</li>
    <li> You can definetely see the difference in color after using this lotion, but it really does leave the orange after color on your whole body.  I like the scent and tinglers.  I would not purchase again as I feel like there are better quality lotions to choose from.</li>
    <li> This is a very intense tingle lotion, not for beginners. Even though I am not a beginner, I did think that this lotion was a bit intense. The second time that I used the lotion, it made my hands super gross brown/orange and streaky. It almost seems like a lotion to not use very often unless you haven&#x27;t been tanning for awhile and need a quick tan look. I used it 3 times in a row and started looking orange. Not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> If you love tingle lotion, like I do, you will love this lotion. It&#x27;s one of the hotter tingle lotions that I have bought. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Its not joking when it says EXTREME tingles. I&#x27;ve only used tingles a few times before, so maybe it&#x27;s not as extreme as I&#x27;m making it out to be. I&#x27;m definitely darker than before I started using it and it didn&#x27;t smell bad after coming out of the booth.Will absolutely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product and will be getting more.</li>
    <li> It gives you Great Color. Love the HOT Tingle. The Best Tingle lotion ive ever used.</li>
    <li> Excellant tanning lotion.  Quick results,  strong tingling sensation. Highly recommended to others. Very cost effective.  Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Wife swears by this an only thing she will use an has for last 3 years . She also puts it on going out on the boat , swears it really deepend the Tan</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for those who already have a GOOD base tan and have used tingle before. The smell is okay. It Has a good tingle for those who have over used tingle lotions and are starting to become immune. The bronzer does have a orange to it, but if you have a good base tan it will not turn you orange, but only add to your bronze color. Washing hands immediately after putting on. I spray my hands with my homemade tanning bed cleaner and wipe my hands off with paper towel after applying. Make sure its completely rubbed in and streaking wont happen. Amazon has the best price on lotions, just make sure products are sealed in the description and when it arrives.</li>
    <li> I forgot my regular lotion at home and bought a couple of sample packs of this.  I am a regular tanner and I&#x27;m already very dark.  I had never used a tingle lotion before and I thought at one point I may burst into flames.  When I got out of the bed I was an extreme red color and the extreme tingle effect made it feel like I had a monster sunburn for about 3 hours.  When I woke up the next day I was astonished at how dark I was, I&#x27;m talking at least 2, maybe 3 shades darker.  I showed my coworkers and they couldn&#x27;t believe the drastic effect either.  The only set back was I was crazy itching, especially my legs for probably 2 days after.  I have used it once again since and again was dark dark dark!!  It&#x27;s all it&#x27;s cracked up to be and I will use this again but not daily, I can&#x27;t imagine what color I would be if I used this daily so I plan to use it every couple of weeks when summer comes back.</li>
    <li> Tans great but boy is it a Tingle!</li>
    <li> took forever to get it.. but was worth the wait.  Helps deepen tan in one use. I love it. will buy again</li>
    <li> Was not inpressed ....left streaks and orange in color.</li>
    <li> Ed Hardy Body Shots met my expectations to the fullest! I could see a difference after the first time tanning. One thing for sure is this product is for experienced tanners only!</li>
    <li> Definitely can feel the tingle! Love this stuff. Works great. So far this is one of my favorite lotions!</li>
    <li> Worst sizzler ever! I am an experienced tanner and have used many other sizzlers before, this one is the worst. I was super carefull and cleaned my hands after application with wet naps and I still got orange hands. The color is not a nice bronze I already had a good base tan and this made me a nasty Oompa Loompa orange. It felt nice during my tanning session but the pain started after. I felt like I had the worst sunburn all night and then was crazy itchy next day! Will never use again!</li>
    <li> I finally found a tingle lotion that actually tingles! I assumed I had become immune to the effects of tingle lotions after using them for so long, so I was expecting the same results with this lotion. I was so wrong! I love this lotion!!! It goes on so smoothly, has a pleasant smell, had a definite sizzle and I saw instant results. I think I&#x27;ve found my new favorite lotion!</li>
    <li> I buy this lotion every year. It is the best. This year I thought I would try some others. Wasted my money because I came right back to body shots. It is by far the best lotion out there with bronzer and tingle. No matter how expensive the lotion ... none beat the results that I get from body shots. I will buy it as long as they continue to make it.</li>
    <li> This lotion makes you dark instantly and the bronzer seems to last longer than several others I&#x27;ve tried! However it dies have HIGH TINGLE factor..so until you get used to it you will feel like you are on ♨️ and like your limbs are numb at the same time!! Awesome stuff though!</li>
    <li> Best tingler lotion I have used so far out of all of the tingler lotions I have tried. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I used it one time, and ive been tannin for years. I will probably never use this again, I was burning for at least 5 hours if not more. Did not see any color difference in myself. If youre just looking for a burn in the tanning bed, this is the stuff for you. If you want some burn and color use Ruby by designer skin</li>
    <li> This lotion is WONDERFUL! U seriously get immediate results, I love tingles it&#x27;s all I use and I&#x27;ve tried MANY. This one is one of my favorites. I do agree with other reviews about leaving ur palms orange but if u bring a wet nap with u and wipe ur palms right before jumping in the bed you&#x27;ll b fine. I think it&#x27;s defanitly worth it for the amazing color u get. However....I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars simply cuz the ATO....to me is NOT good! It smells OK before tanning but after...ugh all I smell is burnt skin and it sucks cuz u really shouldn&#x27;t shower for a few hours so the bronzers really sink in and I won&#x27;t even go in public till I shower cuz its a strooong smell. That&#x27;s my opinion, others seem to not b bothered at all. Basically, great lotion, gives amazing, instant color, yuk smell but worth it if ur only tanning a fee times a week!</li>
    <li> very very hot and great tingle and leaves a great tan for those who reach their limit, this will def help.  Would buy this product again</li>
    <li> This is defintly the BEST tingler i have ever used! Wouldnt reccomend this for inexperianced tanners as the \\&quot;burning affect\\&quot; and \\&quot;redness\\&quot; does last longer than usual tinglers, but other than that this stuff is the best.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few tingle lotions before (Bombshell, Trinity 3,&amp; Hempnotize), but Body Shots is the best one yet! I don&#x27;t reccommend it for your first experince with tingle, but if you want to move up from another tingle lotion I think you&#x27;ll be blown away. It has a great bronzer too and leaves me 2-3 shades darker everytime I use it. I only tan with tingle about once a week before it fades, but the difference is amazing! A WARNING though, some tanning parlors will encourage you to mix your lotions for different effects, DONT with this one unless you are feeling adventerous! I mixed this with JWoww lotion and had stains on the backs of my heels and insides of my wrists for a few days. I have never stained with this lotion by itself though and I am liberal applier, just wipe your palms good after applying. Also the smell of this lotion is a lot different and very pleasant compared to some other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. Bombshell for instance, has a coconutty weird smell and gives off that \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; smell after tanning, with body shots I don&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; scent, just the original light scent. If you don&#x27;t want to commmit to a whole bottle at least try the sample pack, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE REMEMBER TINGLE IS PRETTY INTENSE AND MAY NOT BE FOR EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> Although the lotion is much cheaper when ordered online its quality is not what you can expect from the salon. Since buying online my skin has started to break out because the product is not as good as what you would get if buying from your tanning salon. So you are getting what you pay for I suppose.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell and it left me with an orange uneven tan. I would recommend Obnoxious by Ed Hardy instead.</li>
    <li> This is an intense tingle lotion, which I did not realize when I purchased! Friends had good experience with tingle lotions so I decided to give it a try. It leaves my hands orange and I am not a fan of the smell. I can get the same dark results with other lotions.</li>
    <li> I have tried this hot lotion with my regular go-to lotion paint it black (50\50 mix) and while tanning it does burn slightly but not really at all. I think maybe paint it black has some type of canceling ingredients. I have tried other hot lotions and they work and tingle (even at 50/50 mix) and they even make me short of breath but this one doesn&#x27;t do much WHILE tanning but after you finished you&#x27;ll feel really warm and it feels good on chilly days or when blasting AC. I am in the highest pressure bed and I am to scared to go and use this lotion all out. Maybe ill try it on my legs or my face (just kidding not on my face ill look like a tomato)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint. This lotion will sometimes make you itch and if you try to scratch then it burns and it will make you itch even more. Your best bet is to not scratch/itch your skin at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you sleep on your arm then you&#x27;ll wake up with a red face. It may also make your tan blotchy.</li>
    <li> Omg!! This products just what it says, HOT!!&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars cause it really works but its way to hot&lt;br /&gt;For me! I can&#x27;t handle that much tingle, so if y&#x27;all&lt;br /&gt;Dare, u can try it if u want extreme heat.</li>
    <li> Good fragrance but extremely watery. Tried it out today but product seemed to have no tingle effects and I&#x27;ve tried all the best indoor tan tingling products on the market which makes me wondering if this bottle had water added. I really would like to know if this product is normally runny or watery with an extreme tingle effect?!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first ever tingle lotion. I was a little worried after reading about it but while in the tanning bed, it really isn&#x27;t that bad. For some reason, my forearms are the only part that seem to feel a little on fire but not anymore than the feeling of getting a little burnt by the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER using it, is when I start to feel more uncomfortable. It feels kind of like pins &amp; needles all over my body but it&#x27;s not unbearable or anything. Then I start itching like crazy! It could just be me... I&#x27;ve been known to get weird autoimmune skin problems. I find that if I shower immediately when I get home and scrub my body with soap, the discomfort all goes away within mintues. So yeah, it might be uncomfortable but if you can bear it long enough to make it home &amp; shower, the tan will probably be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as color change, I had plateaued for a while prior to using this, despite having a nice tanning lotion. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and I&#x27;ve gotten a few shades darker each time so it definitely works! Sometimes I look pretty blotchy for a couple hours after I use it but then it seems to even out. My legs look amazing lol can&#x27;t wait to show &#x27;em off. I have a hard time getting dark, but this lotion is really helping me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice lotion and worth the money paid.</li>
    <li> This is a hot tanning lotion and a great product! I can get SHADES darker in one 30 min session. However, my husband is highly sensitive to it so i cant rub up against him until i shower!</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever tried and ive been tanning for years now. It has a very hot tingler in it and the bronzers great!!! I will not use anything else but&amp;#34; body shots&amp;#34;! The ONLY thing I don&#x27;t care for it the scent of this lotion. I would recommend this product to anyone but NOT if you don&#x27;t like tingler.</li>
    <li> I have ordered once before and really liked it, that&#x27;s why I ordered it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best tingle lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s hot and has a great bronzer in it.  It&#x27;s currently my favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> Great results, Smells ok, nothing special, the tingle in this is BEYOND hot! But it does give you great color!</li>
    <li> Saw results that day and love it</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and I love this lotion. Only lotion I use in my bed.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gives you the prettiest color and quickly. It was twice as much at my tanning salon. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS LOTION AND I WOULD TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY ADVANCE TANNER. IF THEY LIKE TINGLE . THIS IS THE STRONGEST I EVER HAD USED.. FOR ADVANCE TANNERS ONLY..</li>
    <li> Great product!  But do not use if you are a beginning indoor tanner.  Extreme tingle factor, some may say uncomfortable.  A couple hours after tanning, you will notice a pink/red glow.  I never burn and I get pink from this. But it turns into a beautiful golden tan.  Highly recommend this product.  But not for people with out a good base tan.</li>
    <li> I like this tingle lotion it is my 3 favorite that I have found in the tingle. I&#x27;m so use to tingles this might be hot for others be sure to have a base tan before using any tingle lotion</li>
    <li> I bought this in the salon, and was extremely disappointed. It was streaky and orange. I would not recommend this lotion. I would however recommend pauly ds sexy swagg, it&#x27;s not a tingle lotion, but it wasmy streaky at all, and gives you a beautiful tan, with fast results! But don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, unless you like a streaky orange tan.</li>
    <li> Orange.  Streaks.  Massive tingle factor lotion. Love a good tingle lotion and fiery burn but a bit too intense and lasts for hours and hours.  .  Worst part about product is the Orange streaking.  Will look to find a better bronzer lotion.</li>
    <li> As a fair skinned girl, I started tanning with Ed Hardy Hollywood Bronze. Great lotion to get your base tan.&lt;br /&gt;I needed that next step. So, I started using Anything Goes. Before I finished the bottle, I needed a stronger lotion to get where I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I started mixing the Ed Hardy Body Shots with my Anything Goes, and immediately, after one tanning session, I saw major results. After mixing those two lotions for a few weeks, I started using the Body Shots alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have a base tan, this is the best lotion for you. Beautiful tan immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the tingler is an extreme one, so feeling like you&#x27;re burnt and coming out of the tanning bed is normal. The redness will go away shortly, leaving a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! Just got out of my tanning bed and I m BROWN and not burning at all.  I was a bit tingly under my armpits, but other than that, it was all at an appropriate level for a tingle bronzer for experienced tanners.  I have NO nasty after tanning burnt smell or that icky sticky slimy grimy feeling.  The smell is great and appropriate for both men and women. I don&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;I want to rush to shower because I feel gross sensation&amp;#34; since it feels good on my skin!  So I can actually wait the minimum 2 hours to shower without the funky smell and feel.  A+++++!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best dark tingle tanning lotion I have ever used. I get a nice even brown NOT ORANGE from using this lotion. I do not use it every day, the tingle is too strong for me to use on a daily basis but love to use it at least once a week! The smell is great, not too overpowering and this lotion goes on well, not streaky! Highly recommend this lotion if you are a fan of tingle!</li>
    <li> Tingle is strong, bronzers not so much...Its okay.  Gave me color, but nothing great</li>
    <li> This stuff made my skin feel like it was burning before I even got in the tanning bed! And no matter how long I was in there even just for a few minutes my skin would be beat red, fried, and painful to the touch! I even got a different brand, used it just fine, and when I had a good tan going tried this lotion again and fries ten times worse! This stuff is awful DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I was feeling brave and bought a sample packet of this lotion. I&#x27;m new to tingle lotions, and it may just be my skin, but the tingle didn&#x27;t seem that intense. I got a little red and itchy after but that faded after an hour. No ATO and got a great boost in my color right off the bat</li>
    <li> I love Ed Hardy Tingle! And I got the actual product. I had been warned that some lotions have been different from the ones in the salon, and only after purchasing do they find out. This did not happen to me, I got the actual Ed Hardy product!!  Ed Hardy tingle is a fire tingle and works well with my skin, but if you are sensitive, do not try it until you are sure you can handle the tingle!&lt;br /&gt;The only down fall to the whole thing is the top, it breaks easily, so I recommend a backup top to keep. I have already replaced mine seeing how the threads in the top were breaking down, but I learned the hard way, and now have replaced the top with a spare! Always have one on hand!!!! Other than the lid issue, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion on april 28th recieved it april 2nd pretty fast delivery! And I must say I love it. Its pretty intense but if thats what ur lookin for order this u want be dissapointed. .I am in love and it also has an amazing smell!!</li>
    <li> I tried this lotion for the first time today...i have been tanning almost everyday or every other day for 2 years and I have tried many diffrent lotions, nothing compares to this! I thought I reached my tanning plateu, but I am about 3 shades darker than I was, and I was already pretty dark! It feels awesome, It goes on smoothly, leaves your skin soft! It&#x27;s an intense tingle, so only use it if you&#x27;ve had expirenice with tingle, my last bottle I had was designer&#x27;s skin Betrayal and it dosent compare to this stuff. But after a couple uses its not so bad. The only downside to this lotion is it smells TERRIBLE. I usually don&#x27;t care about the smell, but afterwards it smells like lemony burnt grease. And it&#x27;s soo strong. Thank god I had the lotion I put on after I tan, the designer skin&#x27;s Angel in kiwi pear which covered up some of the awful smell. But this lotion works so well, Ive decided to keep using it. Happy tanning!(:</li>
    <li> The tingle sensation from this product is great; bronzer does tan but with extreme tan lines if you miss any spot.  would not purchase this for that reason as it was very noticable that a lotion had been applied.</li>
    <li> I dont usually use tingle lotions, and now I remember why! Itz crazy instense...it felt like I was on fire in my bed, i almost pressed the stop button. I came out red, and had a pretty decent base tan. The redness and tingling faded in about 2-3 hours. I am DARKER in 1 use with this lotion than i was tanning the last 27 months with others!!! Do NOT get on your face!!!! I accidentally rubbed my face against the shirt i wore after tanning &amp; now my face is on fire, red,  and blotchy! Wash hands thoroughly!!! And do NOT let others touch you...my boyfriend touched me and the tingle transfered to him and he wasnt happy :-)</li>
    <li> The best tingle lotion out there! It will make you EXTREMELY dark but if you never used tingle before I would mix some of this with normal lotion first. It is intense the first time, you will be red and hot when you get out of the tanning bed but it goes away after about 20 minutes. DO NOT USE OUTSIDE!</li>
    <li> I love all of ed hardy tanning lotions!! This is only for experienced tanners and who love tingle lotions!!  It smells good abd goes on smooth!! It&#x27;s the real deal I&#x27;ve had it before so I now the product I received from Amazon was the real deal!!</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of body shots by edhardy and I highly recommend this lotion especially if you love tingle factor lotions this one is my favorite and I love the smell. This product deserves a 5 star rating and it was shipped to me earlier than I had expected. Very pleased !</li>
    <li> I love the hot tingle, and this is Good but better if you use Insanely Black with this, every other day switch it up. Thanks</li>
    <li> Not sold on this product,Used it a few times with very little results.Would not recommend this lotion to anyone.Will not buy ED Hardy lotion again.</li>
    <li> I really liked this lotion, and would give it more stars if it weren&#x27;t for its after-tanning smell.  It gave me a really great color after only a couple of uses, but I just hated using it because I would smell so bad afterward.  It was also bad about staining my hands and fingernails, even after I made sure everything was rubbed in well. If you like tingle lotions, I wouldn&#x27;t make this one a first choice.</li>
    <li> Not for people that like the extreme heat but good lotion!</li>
    <li> I been tanning for 4 months now try this product and I got burned all over.  I do not like it wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> Tingle too much for me and makes me itch. Otherwise good product, just my taste.</li>
    <li> I love this Tanning Lotion. It tans really, really well. The tingle is a little extreme at first, but gradually gets lighter as you get used to it.  I feel that the tingle helps you tan quicker overall.  There is no orange color or worries of streaking.it goes on very smooth. The color it gives is a beautiful golden brown. The smell is good going on but it does have the &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; after smell that all others have. I have used other products in the past and was not near as satisfied. I have a real problem getting my legs and feet to tan as quickly as the rest of my body, with Ed Hardy they are just as dark as my stomach in the same amount of time!  I literally had a good base tan with this lotion in one week.  It has also lasted over a long period of time. After getting the base tan, I have been able to cut down my tanning time to two days a week. With a busy schedule, that is great for me! This lotion also leaves my skin moisturized and soft. I would highly recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion i have ever purchased.  gives me a nice deep color and has a wonderful smell, unlike other tingles.  Do yourself a favor and buy this.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for many (30) years, this was my 1st experience with Ed Hardy products, it was ok did help with getting a little dark, still waiting to find the lotion that helps get past the tanning plateaue.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning since &#x27;93 and this is the first tanning lotion I have ever used where I do not reach a plateau. This lotion is not for the weak though. It has an EXTREME tingle. Best Lotion out there in my opinion!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend to an experienced tingle tanner only! It&#x27;s an amazing product, best money I have ever spent, all Ed hardy line is awesome as I have used them .. But this item gets your tan a boost big time I&#x27;m on day 3 and my tan has more life! Thanks for an awesome product :)</li>
    <li> One of the best tanning lotions out there.  It will make you red and hot for about an hour after tanning. I tan about 4-5 times a week...now with this I can tan 2-3 times a week and maintain the same color.  GREAT lotion!!!!  It is better than most of the $100.00 lotions I have bought at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> great tingle good color smells good going on has a slight after tan odor its pretty hot i recommend u have a good base tan before use</li>
    <li> extreme tingler?no.medium tingle?no.small tingle when you first put it on?yes,,,a little.it has alot of bronzers,so make sure you wash your hands.recommended for a first time tanner. even a first time tingler.but somebody that has tanned for a few weeks,you dont need it.dont waste your money.get modern bombshell.trinity 3 dont even compare to modern bombshell.</li>
    <li> Second year buying this lotion and I love it ! People ask me how I get so dark and I tell them it&#x27;s this lotion !</li>
    <li> I found when I first applied the lotion it felt like velvet putting it on, but that did not last long. It feels like a very bad sun burn after a few seconds applying the lotion, but the results are amazing. I have been tanning for years so I find it works well for me. I really like the color that it gives. I would recommend it to anyone that is an experienced tanner.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I achieved a great base tan with in a week of using it. Leaves hands orange so be sure you wash after use, but other than that I was impressed!</li>
    <li> This lotion is pretty intense. I am a seasoned tanner for 6 six years now and have never encountered a tingle lotion as strong as this one. After 2 hours of using this lotion my legs were still red and warm. This lotion produces amazing color, I am well pleased and will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> An excellent tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> Works &amp;#34;Ok&amp;#34; but Im not a huge fan of the smell and I feel like it takes forever to start seeing results (unless you leave some in between your fingers then it stains to no end). I have an olive complexion and tan verily easily so was disappointed that it was taking so long to see anything.</li>
    <li> I have been tanning on and off for a few years. This year started using tingles and my first tingle ever was bombshell and that was hot for a first timer! I have used that and then bought this as my second tingle ever! It is hot and makes me burn and itchy but not unbearable. I love it !! It works so good and makes me wicked tan but I&#x27;m using five different lotions from designer skin right now! Using bombshell , body shots Ed hardy , luminary , conceited ,and phoesian ! Buy this!!</li>
