      <li>all I had to do was bend them to make sure they made contact.</li>
      <li>Quite satisfied.</li>
      <li>But I was happy to find that the process was much easier.  </li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes a good bit of disassembly to get them in, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Installation was OK but involves soldering and directions would have been helpful.</li>
      <li>I soldered this into my Norelco razor, charged it, and it has been running for a month without recharging which I believe is BETTER than the battery that came from the factory.  </li>
      <li>I was able to easily replace the batteries in my shaver, but one needs to be able to solder.</li>
      <li>NiCd Flat Top Rechargeable Battery Pack for Norelco electric shaver are amost a perfect fit for the Norelco 835RX.</li>
      <li>It worked great and gave new life to my 9 year razor.  </li>
      <li>this may be more than you want to take on, but I thought the installation was remarkably easy.</li>
      <li>Worked perfectly, has more capacity that the old one, and was very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Test the shaver to make sure it runs fine.</li>
      <li>The original series was for the most part outstanding.</li>
      <li>I love it, it is better than original</li>
      <li>So far after one month of use they are performing great.  </li>
      <li>It has always given me a more comfortable shave than the others.</li>
      <li>item as advertised, good price, fast delivery</li>
      <li>and I was able to replace my battery and have a shaver as good as new again for about $10.  </li>

      <li>Easy as pie.</li>
      <li>They were easy to install in my Norelco.  </li>
      <li>The availability of these batteries was more surprising, in a way, than finding matching heads for my old shaver.  </li>
      <li>and it should easily work.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend these batteries.</li>
      <li>The battery is working ok, nothing special</li>
      <li>Solder the new battery in, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They gave new life to an otherwise perfectly good razor.</li>
      <li>I guess the batteries are fine.</li>

      <li>one of them I installed in my Remington and this one is working fine.</li>
      <li>They work good - better than the last two sets of replacement batteries that I installed, and even better than the original batteries.</li>
      <li>1st the tabs wouldn&#x27;t fit through the circuit board, so I trimmed them &amp; soldered it all in place.</li>
      <li>Why mention that these batteries work for G270 if they don&#x27;t even fit?</li>
      <li>Initially, the batteries worked great.</li>
      <li>Solder tabs need trimming to fit circuit board.</li>
      <li>(no trouble doing so) I have been using these batteries for 20 months and their performance is still good.</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>I was really happy first of all that there is still batteries for these old shavers.</li>
      <li>The existing battery was cleanly and securely attached.  </li>
      <li>Quick and easy replacement for any rechargeable device that uses two AA batteries.  </li>
      <li>I was able to easily replace my shaver battery, and now my 19 year old shaver works as good as new!</li>
      <li>but something in the original charger seems to make it turn off, and something about the battery capacity triggers that.</li>
      <li>it is worth the price!</li>
      <li>I had to desolder the original battery pack from the shaver circuit board.</li>
      <li>Original batteries were only good for about 3 days then it would need recharging.  </li>
      <li>It just required a special tip to remove the screw and a soldering iron.</li>
      <li>Pushing the battery back into the plastic holder seemed to have made a good connection.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great copy and loved it. The original series was for the most part outstanding. Copy sent was in good shape.</li>
    <li> Brought my old Norelco shaver back to life. Been using them for several months and hold charge well</li>
    <li> Easy to install if you have the proper tools. Bought this and new heads. It&#x27;s like getting a new razor!  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> These batteries work great with my Norelco razor. These batteries appear to have larger capacity since its charge retention is better than the original (when new). I had a little trouble soldering the contacts as you need a lot of heat due to a lot of metal. But, I eventually got it. The batteries are marked + and - if you look closely, so no voltmeter is necessary.</li>
    <li> These batteries seem to hold a charge much longer than the Sanyo 800maH batteries that I installed last time.  So far so good.  This time I cut the terminals of the old batteries so that I would not have to unsolder from the pcb.  Worked great.  I used an alligator clip on the old terminal leads to heatsink the heat away from the pcb solder joint.</li>
    <li> I installed this battery using the unsoldered approach in April. It worked great and gave new life to my 9 year razor.  Thanks to all the folks who provided instructions.  It held a good charge until a few weeks ago. It dropped the charge to 0 when it showed 40% full. I&#x27;ve recharged it and it worked, only to drop the charge again. Now it drops the charge to 0 within an hour or so of fully charging.  The razor works fine when it&#x27;s plugged in. I suppose it could be something else, but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the battery.  4.5 months of life</li>
    <li> item as advertised, good price, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Not for everyone. I had to desolder the original battery pack from the shaver circuit board. Then had to trim the leads from replacement battery pack to fit through holes in PCB, then solder new leads to the PCB. Somewhat frustrating. The end result is the shaver has better than factory batteries and works like a dream. This resurrected a dead Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> I have three electric shavers but I keep coming back to my Norelco 7885XL. It has always given me a more comfortable shave than the others. A couple years ago, I had a shaver shop replace the original batteries when they finally failed. I drove across town, waited 40 minutes and then paid him $35. The batteries he installed lasted until recently, but then they also stopped holding a charge. I called the shaver shop again, and this time he said he would charge me $38. Instead, I bought these inexpensive connected Tenergy batteries for my Norelco 7885XL. I can&#x27;t solder worth a hoot so I figured I&#x27;d try the no-solder method that a few other reviewers described. I was able to pry one of the old leads off cleanly, but I had to leave a small part of the second lead on the old battery. Nevertheless, I folded the leads back, inserted the battery pack (carefully paying attention to the correct polarity), and the razor works perfectly -- with a tight fit, a good connection, and no soldering. Easy as pie. The batteries charge quickly. I&#x27;ve been using the razor with these batteries for several weeks now, and all is good.</li>
    <li> I did like another reviewer did and folded the long battery bus leads once and cut off about a quarter to a half inch of insulation on the leads coming off the top of the battery and made sure the battery was placed in the holder the same as the battery which came out in regard to positive and negative leads.  It made a good enough connection to the connectors in the spectra xl razor without soldering but I did anyway.  Be careful to not overheat the connectors, you could unsolder where they attach to the razor.  The battery is working ok, nothing special but I did like the long leads on this battery.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought these batteries for my norelco 905rx shaver. I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about 20 yrs. Replaced the batteries twice. I put these in mine. 1st the tabs wouldn&#x27;t fit through the circuit board, so I trimmed them &amp; soldered it all in place. Put it back together. Now, The shaver gets hot &amp; won&#x27;t charge the batteries!</li>
    <li> This product was mislabeled for positive and negative terminals.  I ended up not using the product because I damaged the razor while replacing the batteries.  It was old, so I just bought a new razor.  I would NOT recommend any product from this company.</li>
    <li> I have yet to determine the quality of the batteries, but as yet (six days) they work well and hold a charge.  Plus delivery was remarkably fast from China.</li>
    <li> I guess I was surprised to receive something with ZERO instructions.  If it weren&#x27;t for the previous reviewers, I wouldn&#x27;t have had a clue what to do.  CHECK your POLARITY!  I opened the case easily with a Torx screwdriver (2 screws).  The existing battery was cleanly and securely attached.  I tried the first tact of trying to pry the tabs using a flat head screwdriver, but it just seems as if I was bending stuff before the solder point, and making a mess.  I whipped out the ol&#x27; solder iron and attempted to remove the tabs from the battery, but only managed to melt some of the surrounding plastic (soldering was never my thing!).  I ended up carefully bending the metal tab as close the the battery as I could, until it broke.  I ended up with two tabs sticking up from the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I was a little confused with the plastic shrink tube covering on the battery tabs!  This has to be removed.  Because I wasn&#x27;t going to try my hand at soldering again, what I ended up doing is snipping the top part of the tabs off and using a very small flat head screwdriver, making a little insulated pocket.  On my shaver (7865XL), in order to get the polarity correct, the tabs had to be completely folder over the top of the battery.  I then pushed the tips on the shaver side, inside the pocket I created on the battery side,  so there was a metal-to-metal connection.  Pushing the battery back into the plastic holder seemed to have made a good connection.  Before screwing all back, I pushed the power button and got spinning heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery was weak, so I had to charge it, and it charged fine, and seems to be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars for value, but would have given 5 if there were some simple instructions.  This install is definitely not a \\&quot;Plug-n-play\\&quot; event, like changing batteries on your cordless phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I had no trouble replacing the battery in my old Norelco razor. I tried the no solder installation. The battery would not charge until I doubled the leads back. This forced a good contact, and I have had no trouble since. The razor has been going for 3 weeks now on the first charge. It is like a new razor!</li>
    <li> love it - restored my old norelco</li>
    <li> Replaced old leaky batteries in a Norelco razor a couple weeks ago. So far the batteries fully charge up and hold the charge. For about $8 it was like getting a new razor.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old batteries in my Spectra 8865xl.  These babies were great!  No soldering needed!  Charges last for weeks!  Love it!</li>
    <li> The battery works fine in my shaver (Norelco 6863 XL).&lt;br /&gt;The install was fairly easy, the hardest part was prying the solder tabs off the old battery. Once that was done this pack simply plugs in with no soldering required (the batteries sit in a battery holder with no movement possible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Note that I had previously installed 2 three year old duracell 2000mah nimh LSD batteries (supposed to be eneloops in a duracell wrapper). Shaver worked great with the duracells and a charge lasted much longer which is understandable given the mah rating and the very low self discharge of the duracells.</li>
    <li> I installed these in my old Norelco 6886XL (15 year old shaver).  They work good - better than the last two sets of replacement batteries that I installed, and even better than the original batteries. A little tricky to install - requires some mechanical skills - they should be soldered in-place, but can be wedged-in also. The shaver ran faster than ever and the batteries lasted without charging during a six-week-long travel trip where I shaved everyday. Wow! I strongly recommend these batteries.</li>
    <li> Unable to get a good solder connection.</li>
    <li> Just follow the directions of others for installing it without soldering. Works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Gave new life to an old razor that could barely make it through a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> My Norelco shaver works like new.  These batteries have powered my shaver for three weeks before needing recharged. Now I can travel without the cord !</li>
    <li> I was able to easily replace the batteries in my shaver, but one needs to be able to solder. I hope that this set holds a charge and has a capacity of more than the last set (different brand and seller). The last set would last about 2 weeks when new in my shaver. So far its been over a month since replacement and the shaver is still running strong.</li>
    <li> Good replacement for shaver battery. You must solder into shaver.</li>
    <li> Fit as expected and worked very well. Easy to install with no problems.  Holds charge well.  Sure is better than paying a shop 50 or 60 dollars for same results.</li>
    <li> Used the batteries to replace ones in my Dremel 4.8 V minimite; FANTASTIC Works better than when it was brand new.</li>
    <li> Solder tabs need trimming to fit circuit board.</li>
    <li> These work well for replacing Norelco razor batteries.</li>
    <li> The batteries arrived timely.  The installation went well after reviewing the YouTube video.  The installation was impeded because the solder tabs were too wide to go through the PCB slots.</li>
    <li> I had read in other reviews that I&#x27;d have to re-solder the new battery contacts after removing the old battery.  But I was happy to find that the process was much easier.  After carefully removing the old batteries by gently breaking the contacts away from the shaver, I was able to insert the replacement ones snugly enough to establish good contact.  No soldering needed.  With the new batteries and a blade sharpening kit, my shaver is good as new.</li>
    <li> New life for my favorite Norelco shaver. Since my batteries snap into a holder, I did not use the soldering method. I was able to break away the old tabs and just folded the new into a zig zag pattern. They seem to make good contact. Shaver works great!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product, perhaps even better than the original equipment. Replacement in your old equipment could be problematic requiring tools you may not have or extensive disassembly of internal sub-chassis. Check difficulty of battery replacement before you buy.</li>
    <li> I received the batteries in a timely manner. They were easy to install in my Norelco.  It didn&#x27;t take too long to charge. The first use lasted about 15 seconds and then the batteries were completely discharged.  New battery I thought; maybe they need a conditioning charge.  Recharged and got the same result, discharged in 15 or so seconds.  I ordered and installed a different brand of battery.  The different battery and my razor have been working well. The Tenergy batteries are on their way to be recycled.</li>
    <li> I bought this to bring life back to my Norelco G270. The two batteries are stuck together. This is clearly made for a different model, since the batteries don&#x27;t fit in the chamber. I hacked it, put the wires out of the chamber, wrapped them up in electrical tape (quite proud of myself), found that it worked as hacked, then discovered that the charger refuses to charge as hacked. It&#x27;s the same current, voltage, etc. but something in the original charger seems to make it turn off, and something about the battery capacity triggers that. I could poke around inside of the charger, but I think this is just ridiculous. Why mention that these batteries work for G270 if they don&#x27;t even fit?</li>
    <li> The availability of these batteries was more surprising, in a way, than finding matching heads for my old shaver.  They went in easily and the price was extremely low for the value.  My shaver is back to life!</li>
    <li> Item works very well with my old Norelco shaver.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is better than original anyway you have to know how to sadder and install battery.  Once again I love it</li>
    <li> Purchased 2/15 for my Norelco razor. The battery tabs had to be narrowed to use in my razor but no big deal. Initially, the batteries worked great. I was very impressed. Unfortunately, about a month ago the razor&#x27;s charge started lasting for a much shorter period, decreasing from 35 minutes to 6-8 minutes. I disassembled the razor and found that one of the cells could no longer be fully charged. The batteries have only been recharged a few times, and I&#x27;m careful to only charge NiCd batteries when fully discharged, so battery memory is not the cause. I probably just got a lemon set, but I won&#x27;t be buying these batteries again. The effort required to replace the batteries is a bigger issue than the cost, IMO.</li>
    <li> I have a Philips/Norelco 5865 which has had several rechargeable battery replacements.  This has become an increasingly expensive proposition.  When i discovered these batteries, though I have two left thumbs, I decided, for the price, it would be worth trying.  Removal was a little more involved than others have described and my contacts eventually broke.  Not a problem since the terminal tabs from these batteries were long enough to make contact and were held in place by the shaver body and brackets which negated the need to solder.  The batteries charged quickly and, after several uses, are maintaining the charge.  Quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> These batteries worked great for 2 months and 3 charges, then died. Won&#x27;t hold a charge. Kudos to the seller for accepting the refund even though it was past 30 days. But they are poor quality batteries and soldering them in and out is too much of a pain to try replacements from the same maker. I&#x27;m willing to spend a little more for OEM quality replacements that will last for years like the originals did.&lt;br /&gt;Due to poor quality they would get a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; but I upgraded to &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; for the good service accepting the return.</li>
    <li> Ordered from Battery Superstore and it arrived within a few days in padded envelope. My Norelco 7616X is 10 years old and the battery would barely hold charge to last 1-2 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal of the old battery was easy: remove two screws (one under the folding trimmer) with straight Phillips screwdriver. Slide out the back cover and remove the battery. Replace the new one and put the back cover on. Easy as pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: instead of de-soldering the old battery, just snip/cut the 2 metal leads with a wire cutter, at the points closest to the battery. That would leave these 2 leads on the battery chamber. Now strip/pull the rubber cover from the new battery leads, and just lay the new battery over the old leads. This arrangement is already secure enough. Test the shaver to make sure it runs fine. Lastly, tape the assembly to make it more secure.</li>
    <li> Desperately needed to replace the batteries in my Norelco Spectra 8825XL shaver. Batteries+Plus wanted $30 plus they wanted to keep the shaver a couple of days to do the work. These batteries, including shipping, were about $10. Replacement was simple AFTER getting the tabs welded to the original batteries cut off. I did use a knife (box cutter with a new blade) to cut them off the battery pack. Soldering the extra long flat conductors included with the new battery pack to the original tabs cut off the original battery pack was a snap using a 30 watt pencil iron. Do not dwell long when making the new solder joints. These batteries seem to be better than the originals. Thus far, they&#x27;ve lasted 21 days with no sign of slowing down on their first and only charge. I am very pleased with them...a perfect replacement. UPDATE: Got 35 great shaves out of the 1st charge. It actually probably had at least 10 more fine shaves left on that charge, but the speed had nearly imperceptibly dropped.</li>
    <li> The batteries seem to be fine powering my razor but I had problems installing them. The slots in the printed circuit board that receive the battery tabs are different sizes. One slot is wider than the other. The battery tabs are the same size as the larger slot. I had to trim one of the battery tabs down quite a bit for the installation to work.</li>
    <li> Have a Norelco 7735X shaver.  Original batteries were only good for about 3 days then it would need recharging.  Decided to give these a try.  Original batteries were around 700mAh so these were a higher capacity battery.  Opened the shaver and not having a decent small soldering iron, I opted to try something different.  Cut the solder tabs off the old batteries as close to the battery as possible and folded them down to act as contacts for the new batteries.  Cut the shrink wrap tubing off the new batteries and folded the solder tabs down as contacts.  Slipped the new batteries into the holder.  (Think I needed a thin piece of cardboard at the bottom of the new batteries to keep them tight to the contacts in the holder.)  Closed up the case and put it in the charger for 24 hours.  The first charge lasted about 30 days shaving once a day.  Second charge went a few days longer.  I&#x27;m now on the fourth charge (installed in Feb) and still going strong.</li>
    <li> I purchased this battery pack replacement for my older Norelco 955RX shaver.  The batteries hold a charge long, and are easy to install.</li>
    <li> This battery was just the thing my old shaver needed - revived so now it works almost like new!  The old battery was not charging and would only last a few seconds - this new one holds a charge and lasts much longer than needed to shave.  Installation was not that difficult with the right tools.  If you need a new battery for your electric shaver and this one will fit - I would recommend buying it - it is worth the price!</li>
    <li> This battery pack fit perfectly.  After working the connection strips off the old batteries, it was very easy to solder the strips to the new battery leads.  The original batteries lasted 12+ years, but they had worn down to about 12 days between charges.  The first cycle of this battery pack lasted 42 days of daily use.  Because of the memory effect of NiCad, I run the charge down to nothing before a recharge.  This means ignoring the device low battery beeps, and getting another dozen or so days use before a recharge. So I expect something else to break down before these batteries go bust.  And no, it is not Elaine using the shaver, but her hubby.</li>
    <li> Fixed my shaver with these.Work Great.</li>
    <li> I was really happy first of all that there is still batteries for these old shavers. After bending the old batteries back and forth to break off the original tabs I was expecting to solder the tabs to a pair of jumper wires, but because the batteries came with extra long tabs on them all I needed to do was to make three folds of the tab to act like a spring and just simply insert the batteries.  So far after one month of use they are performing great.  Would recommend these to everyone looking to save a few bucks on a new razor.</li>
    <li> Did not work, never could get it work no matter what I did, could not get to hold charge complete waste of money,</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, unit works like new</li>
    <li> Have used the Tenergy battery brand in the past and have been pleased with the high quality and durability of their products.  This one is certainly no exception.  The extra long leads on one end of the battery are covered in a non-conductive covering that is easily slipped off or trimmed to fit for your given application.  I have an old Norelco Model 7885XL electric shaver that I use for traveling.  The battery finally gave out making the razor inoperable.  I was going to throw it in the trash but decided to search that Web to see if anyone had a replacement battery pack.  Sure enough, Amazon listed a couple of choices.  This particular battery pack was the best bang for the buck.  I was able to complete the replacement without any soldering.  I followed the lead of an earlier reviewer that stated that all you had to do was very carefully pry the battery tabs loose from the weld points with a small screwdriver.  I took my time and this worked perfectly after bending the battery tabs back and forth a few times.  With the extra long length of the battery leads on the Tenergy  battery pack I simply took a small pair of long nose pliers and bent each tab end over end a few times which made each one function as a spring.  I slipped the new pack into the plastic battery pack holder in the electric razor and the battery tabs joined perfectly with the spring force of the terminals keeping it locked into place.  Reinstalled the cover and secured the two screws.  When I turned the device over I noted that the battery charge indicator was flashing on the LCD screen.  I plugged in the power supply and the new battery pack immediately began taking the charge.  If you are looking for an inexpensive way to give your old Norelco shaver new life, this is definitely that way to go.  Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> These solved my problem - that the old batteries wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a good bit of disassembly to get them in, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the batteries need to be soldered in. It tales a long tip professional solder station (mine is a Weller adjustable with sensing tips) to un-solder and then solder in the new ones so the small circuit board doesn&#x27;t get damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to have experience working on very small electronics to avoid ruining the Norelco.</li>
    <li> This item has restored my razor to like-new condition.  It was easy to install but did require soldering to ensure a good connection.</li>
    <li> Higher capacity and longer lasting replacement battery then others I have tried.  The Tenergy battery is a higher capacity quality replacement.</li>
    <li> These are bigger capacity than the original and caused my charger circuit in the shaver to burn out.  I think you only want to use 800 mAh.</li>
    <li> I own two older norelco shavers that has always work great, but then it was not taking the charge.With minor alteration on the tabs,the batteries have given my shavers a second live at little cost.</li>
    <li> This replacement battery pack worked well for me. It won&#x27;t go well unless you have soldering experience though. Once charged up the pack worked as good if not better than the original.</li>
    <li> I guess the batteries are fine. Time will tell.  As for the solder tabs, they are a joke.  They were to large to install on the PC board.&lt;br /&gt;Had to cut them off, and install the ones from the old batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does this company advertise these batteries as drop-in replacement.  No Way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jcr</li>
    <li> It came with only half capacity of the original battery with my shaver. My shaver has a capacity meter and it barely made to 60% when it was new. It dropped to 40% after a couple of months, and then 20%. It is totally dead after 6 months.</li>
    <li> These batteries work GREAT!!!  My Norelco had died several years ago and I was about to chunk it before I thought I&#x27;d take it apart and see what was up with the batteries.  I took the old corroded ones out and cleaned it up, found and ordered these, popped them in with only pressure on the contacts (no soldering done) and it works like a charm!  Holds a charge pretty well, it&#x27;s basically like new.  This saved me a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I do have some prior electrical experience and the original batteries were a pain in the butt to get out, but if you know how to replace them, these work very well.  Would buy again if/when these die.</li>
    <li> Worked fine ,,A little tricky getting old battery out ..This set up worked for my older mode shaver..Runs great now...</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite the simple repair I thought it would be.  I thought it would be remove and replace which was not the case.  Ended up cutting out the old leads and bend the new leads over the battery top and put it back in the razor.  Charged them up and they seem to be lasting okay.  Time will tell.  Would I purchase again.....YES.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy replacement for any rechargeable device that uses two AA batteries.  It has two tabs ready to be soldered into place and only takes a minute or two to install.  Although it says for Norelco shavers it can be used in most any brand of rechargeable shaver or hair clipper that uses 3 volts.</li>
    <li> Worked fine in my Norelco shaver,  I did need to do a little soldering but no problems.  Last much much longer between charges now</li>
    <li> I installed them into a Norelco razor. They charged up and I was able to use the razor as long as the razor was plugged in. When I unplugged the razor, however, the razor ran for about one second and the batteries were completely dead. They simply didn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
    <li> old battery was shutting down when only 20% used-abrupt stoppage. Tenergy battery fit perfectly. I was unable to pry the old leads off as others had. Had to use a pen style soldering iron. Otherwise not problem. As with others, note which lead is positive before you undo as the cradle is unmarked.</li>
    <li> I unsoldered the old battery pack from our Norelco electric razor and easily soldered this one in place.  It is better to do it yourself, if you are reasonably handy, as taking it to Norelco or some other repair shop may cost as much as another razor</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Remington shaver and had to file down the solder tabs slightly. (no trouble doing so) I have been using these batteries for 20 months and their performance is still good. I find them to be a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> The battery was somewhat difficult to install because the electrical connections in the shaver are so short, however, the tabs on the new battery were long enough to make it work.  This battery has more capacity than the original.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets. one of them I installed in my Remington and this one is working fine. The second set I installed in my norelco and battery runs out after 3 shaves. I did completely discharge the second set several times and still got similar results.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack to replace an old, failing pack in my Norelco Spectra.  I followed the instructions from one of the other reviewers on doing a non solder connection. I got the old soldered connection off and then just inserted the connections  into this battery pack leads after folding them over. Results were  perfect. I now have a new shaver.  What a slick way to renovate an old, throw away Norelco.</li>
    <li> I followed the advice from other reviews and I was able to replace my battery and have a shaver as good as new again for about $10.  Thanks for the help.  Anyone looking to save some money and keep their old razor should try this battery replacement.</li>
    <li> In a last ditch effort to save my Norelco, I tried a \\&quot;new\\&quot; battery. Would not hold a charge even after repeated charge ups and downs.  Gave up threw it away and ended up getting a blade.</li>
    <li> We tried to salvage an older shaver with these, but without success.  No problem or fault of the battery pack.</li>
    <li> I soldered this into my Norelco razor, charged it, and it has been running for a month without recharging which I believe is BETTER than the battery that came from the factory.  Installation was not complicated.  It just required a special tip to remove the screw and a soldering iron.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sons electric shaver which was used for a short time and then sat for over 6 years, in his closet. The shaver is still in a new condition. Thought I would just replace the battery to freshen it up. Looks just fine with tabs as pictured. Don&#x27;t think there will be a problem. Looking forward to installing it.</li>
    <li> These replacement batteries were much cheaper than a new shaver.  Two small phillips point screws allow access to the battery compartment.  Use diagonal clippers to snip out the old batteries, being careful to leave some leads showing.  Solder the new battery in, and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used a soldering iron this may be more than you want to take on, but I thought the installation was remarkably easy.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd battery purchase in a year from Amazon (previous one being a less expensive competitor) and the best for my old Norelco shaver model 5822XL. The battery last twice as long before a recharging (2+ weeks as ooposed to weekly).For those wondering abour re-soldering ...not necessary if you do&lt;br /&gt;1) remove old battery by cutting and leaving enough of the metallic leads to accept the replacement battery&lt;br /&gt;2) on the replacement battery, bend the leads to act as a spring&lt;br /&gt;3) insert so that the &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; leads on the replacement come in contact with the in-place leads&lt;br /&gt;4) may use a small jewelers flat head screwdrive to extend the leads to assure good contact&lt;br /&gt;5) screw on the razor back plate and it should easily work.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!  I was able to easily replace my shaver battery, and now my 19 year old shaver works as good as new!</li>
    <li> The batteries did what I wanted them to. They gave new life to an otherwise perfectly good razor. As many other reviews state, it helps to have some soldering know-how, or as in my case, someone with the tools and knowledge.</li>
    <li> This battery pack has the exact dimensions of the original, including the mounting tabs.  Buyer beware, this is NOT a drop-in replacement; it requires careful soldering. and should not be your first soldering job.  This part got my razor working again, but now 6+ months later I notice that it does not hold a charge as well as it did at first. Overall, I&#x27;d say that it is a reasonably priced replacement battery if you want to keep your old razor running.</li>
    <li> Works very well in my Norelco shave. Took some soldering skill to unsolder the old one. I had replaced the original one in this shaver before, so it complicated maters. This new one is lasting a long time between charges.</li>
    <li> Both leads are slightly wider, but trimmed them off some what, soldered them on board.  Shaver can be fully charged again.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> Worked Great.  Soldered directly to old solder tabs.  Replaced screws and was up and working in no time.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> These Battery cells were exactly the right size. I got directions from youtube on how to replace the&lt;br /&gt;rechargeable batteries in my dad&#x27;s shaver.</li>
    <li> This brought my 1998 razor back to life--with minimum effort on my part.  The batteries were pre-soldered on one end and all I had to do was take the black plastic off the two tabs shown on the left end to reveal the contacts.  I did not have to solder to the holder--all I had to do was bend them to make sure they made contact.</li>
    <li> Excellent battery pack.  fit perfectly in my old Norelco which now holds a charge for more than 7 long shaves.</li>
    <li> Several of the battery packs had an extremely short life span!  My new advice in battery selection is to pick the &amp;#34;higher price spread&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; :).  I got what I paid for!</li>
    <li> Disclosure: you need a soldering iron and solder sucker to remove the old battery cleanly and install the new one.&lt;br /&gt;Dismantling the shaver and re-assembling was not difficult, but you do need a T8 driver.&lt;br /&gt;Works great. Capacity at least as good as the original.&lt;br /&gt;I had dim and distant memories of the shaver running for almost three weeks on a single charge, and the motivation for the replacement was when the battery life fell to about one week.&lt;br /&gt;After the replacement, I ran the battery down to empty and charged it overnight - then went on vacation with it, then came back, then used it for ten more days.... You get the idea - holds its charge and lasts about three weeks again, just like new!</li>
    <li> Battery works great, the original battery is a 2.4v and 640mah. I am using it for a homedics clipper and it fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> My Norelco razor was getting 3 shaves from a charge (after 5 years). After installing these I get over a month, more than when the razor was new. Installation was OK but involves soldering and directions would have been helpful.</li>
    <li> These worked great as a replacement for my razor batteries</li>
    <li> This was used to replace batteries in my Wahl beard trimmer that would not hold a charge any longer. Worked perfectly, has more capacity that the old one, and was very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> These replaced the factory batteries in my Norelco shaver and now I am getting a week+ of shaves without recharging.</li>
    <li> 5-5-2013. The Tenergy AA 2.4V 1000mAh NiCd Flat Top Rechargeable Battery Pack for Norelco electric shaver are amost a perfect fit for the Norelco 835RX. The circuit board solder terminals have a smaller slot for the Positve Terminal battery lead and required removal of 1/16&amp;#34; from the width of the terminal lead to fit (a small pair of scissors worked well to trim it). Otherwise, it a perfect fit and seems to work well. Replacing the batteries and adding a new shaver head (Philips Norelco HQ56 Reflex Plus and Micro Action Electric Razor Replacement Heads), along with cleaning shaving debris from inside the unit and applying Super Lube Synthetic Grease with Syncolon Multi Purpose Lubricant (3 oz tube by Loctite) grease to the rotating pivots and gears on the head mechanism fully restored this shaver to life; almost like new. I can&#x27;t remember how many years I have had the 835RX, but it&#x27;s probably 15+ (my best guess) as I have now replaced the NiCad batteries  and shaving heads twice.</li>
