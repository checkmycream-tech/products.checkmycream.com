      <li>GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
      <li>It is the best razor replacement blade I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Excellent experience !</li>
      <li>Great product  !</li>
      <li>It continues to do and excellent job</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m thinking that anyone who buys this product will be a happy camper.  </li>
      <li>I was absolutely happy with my Mangroomer product up to the point when I had to replace the foil.</li>
      <li>Works well great trimmer</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I have loved my Mangroomer since I got it about a year ago.</li>
      <li>Amazon always has a good price for the foil, thus we keep returning.</li>
      <li>Prompt shipment, good product.</li>
      <li>Honestly, my father must have been a wookie, and my mother an Ewok.</li>
      <li>The supporting shaver is great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been through many of these.    </li>
      <li>this company made great shavers when they first started out, but now they make cheap junk</li>
      <li>This groomer started out great when it was new.</li>
      <li>Good product but wear out fast.</li>
      <li>Installed fine.</li>
      <li>My heads seem to cut fine</li>
      <li>Looks fine.</li>
      <li>Happy overall.</li>
      <li>It gives a firm and close shave and is especially good to handle.</li>
      <li>I purchased this after the foil came off of my original shaver head.</li>
      <li>and they are nothing like the original one I bought.</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of different groomers over the years and by far this is the best.  </li>
      <li>i was glad to see it was easy to install a new foil , since i broke the plastic on the original trying to remove it and clean the hair out without reading the instructions on day 2 .</li>
      <li>My original one lasted for years ( I dont use this shaver that much and the blade was fine until the foil broke)</li>
      <li>This replacement foil for the ManGroomer has a fresh trimmer edge too.</li>
      <li>It worked fine for about a month until the foil seperated from the new one as well.</li>
      <li>If you make it past that, you have probably have a good one so don&#x27;t touch it or clean it as it can&#x27;t take the abuse.  </li>
      <li>The latter unit is not as wide as I would have hoped for it to be and it costs a bit more, but does the job OK.</li>
      <li>But now it has gone down hill fast and doesn&#x27;t perform anywhere near as good.</li>
      <li>I ended up having to replace the razor which I actually really like, but refused to keep repurchasing faulty replacement heads.</li>
      <li>The foil was recessed on one side, it made a strange rattling sound when I turned it on</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>One might go 6 months before falling apart, but next falls apart right away.  </li>
      <li>It made my &#x27;groomer work like new.</li>
      <li>Thus you ahve to keep ordering new replacement heads.</li>
      <li>I thought about buying a whole new unit but figure it will do the same thing.</li>
      <li>They were the proper foils, installed easily, and work as well as can be expected.    </li>
      <li>It pulls like an old worn out razor blade.</li>
      <li>but I really don&#x27;t think that it is smart enough to distinguish a male hair from a female hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a little concerned as the razor work pretty flawlessly when new, but now it seems to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; the hairs, which is more painful and makes it difficult to use.    </li>

<li> When it was time to get a new foil, I thought I would get a SHARP one; my mistake!</li>
<li> It is easy when inserting the replacement foil into the shaver to push the foil screen into the replacement head (making it useless)  by just putting pressure on the the plastic sides trying to snap it into place.</li>
<li> It served me well and long.</li>
<li> It actually does trim all imaginable body parts (yes, even down there) quite painlessly</li>
<li> With this replacement blade, I can tame the hairiness and can actually see my lips on occasion.</li>
<li> and I was due to be changed.</li>
<li> Not sure if this is a problem with the foil, or the shaver overall.</li>
<li> (yes, I disposed of it BEFORE the new one arrived, so I know I did not get the two confused).</li>
<li> I have purchased 2 of these groomers thru far and the foil on the heads is secured poorly and my foil head keeps coming off.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t work, is not accurate, don&#x27;t waste your money and your time to buy this product, it&#x27;s not worth</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve replaced the head with little to no improvement.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never experienced any irritation and it holds power for long time.</li>
<li> #34;what can go wrong with a small bit like this, right?&amp;#34; As a result I am forced to discontinue the use of the Shaver altogether and after a rather long research switched to Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro.</li>
<li> Long hair, short hair - all it does is pulling it, which is incredibly painful and as you can imagine frustrating.</li>
<li> Expect a 40-50% failure rate before 2 weeks out of the gate.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s impossible to get them back in since they always seems to bend when they come out, making them impossible to put back in.</li>
<li> So when you get frustrated with ManGroomer product, look at Norelco next.</li>
<li> and I have no issues with the razor body itself - just the flimsy, poorly constructed foil screen on the heads...</li>
<li> I have repplaced 4 heads within 1 yr so far and am very disappointed.</li>
<li> Constantly fails.  </li>
<li> Sadly for me, I already disposed of the packaging material thinking &amp;</li>
<li> I bought the groomer at a Target about a year or 2 ago and have found it increasingly difficult to find replacement foils without going online as Target doesn&#x27;t seem to carry Mangroomer products anymore.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really disappointed that I&#x27;d get a defective product coming from the manufacture itself.</li>
<li> Really disappointed and in a quandary about what to do now!</li>

    <li> this company made great shavers when they first started out, but now they make cheap junk</li>
    <li> The foil on my shaver was damaged, and I ordered replacement foils.    They were the proper foils, installed easily, and work as well as can be expected.    I&#x27;m a little concerned as the razor work pretty flawlessly when new, but now it seems to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; the hairs, which is more painful and makes it difficult to use.    Not sure if this is a problem with the foil, or the shaver overall.</li>
    <li> Lets not be sexist.  This product works well for me but I really don&#x27;t think that it is smart enough to distinguish a male hair from a female hair so I&#x27;m thinking that anyone who buys this product will be a happy camper.  It actually does trim all imaginable body parts (yes, even down there) quite painlessly but you still need to realize which part of the trimmer that needs to be used.</li>
    <li> i was glad to see it was easy to install a new foil , since i broke the plastic on the original trying to remove it and clean the hair out without reading the instructions on day 2 .</li>
    <li> This groomer started out great when it was new. But now it has gone down hill fast and doesn&#x27;t perform anywhere near as good. I&#x27;ve replaced the head with little to no improvement. It pulls like an old worn out razor blade. I thought about buying a whole new unit but figure it will do the same thing. I&#x27;ve looked but nobody is selling anything like it so I&#x27;m stuck. Bummer!</li>
    <li> Honestly, my father must have been a wookie, and my mother an Ewok. With this replacement blade, I can tame the hairiness and can actually see my lips on occasion. It is the best razor replacement blade I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipment, good product. Happy overall. My husband uses the mangroomer and about once a year he replaces the foil.  Amazon always has a good price for the foil, thus we keep returning.</li>
    <li> I have loved my Mangroomer since I got it about a year ago. When it was time to get a new foil, I thought I would get a SHARP one; my mistake! The replacement was duller than the one I threw away (yes, I disposed of it BEFORE the new one arrived, so I know I did not get the two confused). Really disappointed and in a quandary about what to do now!</li>
    <li> Works well great trimmer</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, is not accurate, don&#x27;t waste your money and your time to buy this product, it&#x27;s not worth it believe me....</li>
    <li> Excellent experience !</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different groomers over the years and by far this is the best.  That is why i replaced the foil recently rather than buying another groomer.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> As someone who tried several body groom shaving products the MANGROMER Private shaver exceeded my expectations. It gives a firm and close shave and is especially good to handle. I&#x27;ve never experienced any irritation and it holds power for long time. Great product  ![[ASIN:B001A035V0 MANGROOMER Private Body Shaver]]</li>
    <li> I purchased this after the foil came off of my original shaver head. It worked fine for about a month until the foil seperated from the new one as well. I ended up having to replace the razor which I actually really like, but refused to keep repurchasing faulty replacement heads.</li>
    <li> The supporting shaver is great and I have had it for a while and I was due to be changed. It continues to do and excellent job so I endorse it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 of these groomers thru far and the foil on the heads is secured poorly and my foil head keeps coming off. I have repplaced 4 heads within 1 yr so far and am very disappointed. Seems if you put any pressure on these heads on curves like around the back of your knee, arms, etc, the foil cover pops out of the head and it&#x27;s impossible to get them back in since they always seems to bend when they come out, making them impossible to put back in. Thus you ahve to keep ordering new replacement heads. My heads seem to cut fine and I have no issues with the razor body itself - just the flimsy, poorly constructed foil screen on the heads...</li>
    <li> I was absolutely happy with my Mangroomer product up to the point when I had to replace the foil. It served me well and long. I ordered a replacement and it cost me between $15-$16 shipped. Installed fine. Looks fine. But there is a defect of a sort: it does not shave. Long hair, short hair - all it does is pulling it, which is incredibly painful and as you can imagine frustrating. Sadly for me, I already disposed of the packaging material thinking &amp;#34;what can go wrong with a small bit like this, right?&amp;#34; As a result I am forced to discontinue the use of the Shaver altogether and after a rather long research switched to Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro. The latter unit is not as wide as I would have hoped for it to be and it costs a bit more, but does the job OK. So when you get frustrated with ManGroomer product, look at Norelco next. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These things pull hair! I bought three and they are nothing like the original one I bought. Avoid these things!</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do but is not made that well. My original one lasted for years ( I dont use this shaver that much and the blade was fine until the foil broke) It is easy when inserting the replacement foil into the shaver to push the foil screen into the replacement head (making it useless)  by just putting pressure on the the plastic sides trying to snap it into place. So when you buy this, buy 2 in case this happens to you.</li>
    <li> The foil was recessed on one side, it made a strange rattling sound when I turned it on and then it CUT ME! I bought the groomer at a Target about a year or 2 ago and have found it increasingly difficult to find replacement foils without going online as Target doesn&#x27;t seem to carry Mangroomer products anymore. I&#x27;m really disappointed that I&#x27;d get a defective product coming from the manufacture itself. No product should HURT you! I will be looking into purchasing a unit from a different brand.</li>
    <li> These well made products are just what I was looking for. This is well made and arrived in short order. Thank You!!</li>
    <li> Constantly fails.  Hit and miss.  One might go 6 months before falling apart, but next falls apart right away.  Expect a 40-50% failure rate before 2 weeks out of the gate.  If you make it past that, you have probably have a good one so don&#x27;t touch it or clean it as it can&#x27;t take the abuse.  I&#x27;ve been through many of these.    At $20, this is double the price at mangroomer.com and walmart.com.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil for the ManGroomer has a fresh trimmer edge too. It made my &#x27;groomer work like new. I&#x27;ll have to remember to try to replace it every 6-8 months instead of every 2 years. Good product.</li>
    <li> Good product but wear out fast. Wish micro shield would last longer. Bought two this time for when it is time to replace.</li>
