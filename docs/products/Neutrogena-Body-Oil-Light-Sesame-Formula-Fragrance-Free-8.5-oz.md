<ol>
      <li>Wife and I are using it especially more often during the winter.</li>
      <li>Best to shop around for this one.  </li>
      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>Used immediately after a show and your skin will feel great!</li>
      <li>Feels great.</li>
      <li>It does not smell like sesame oil at all, which is good.</li>
      <li>Wonderful to have a fragrance free body oil that smells and feels good.</li>
      <li>Primarily, this is a great moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>This unscented, fragrance free oil, works great.  </li>
      <li>Nice to apply after a bath, but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing.</li>
      <li>Wish more good products were made for those of us allergic to fragrance.</li>
      <li>I do not use this kind of stuff because I am too macho (just kidding around)</li>
      <li>Lightyears more effective than baby oil or any lotion I&#x27;ve every tried (and I have tried them all).</li>
      <li>I love the Fragrance-Free version of this oil.</li>
      <li>4 Stars for Neutrogena Body Oil, Fragrance Free, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2) !</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>and I am alergic to many fragrances and am so pleased I can get it at Amazon most places carry the perfumed version</li>
      <li>It does not smell like food, so it will not interfere with your favorite fragrance.      </li>
      <li>It actually has a very pleasant sensual smell.</li>
      <li>Love this unscented oil for its silky, smooth and lightweight texture.</li>
      <li>I was glad to see it available from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Easy for after shower or to give massages.</li>
      <li>A very mild smelling, non-greasy moisturizing body oil.</li>
      <li>was that it is fragrance free and does not interfere with my cologne.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and penetrates quickly.  </li>
      <li>but I do realize that a smooth skin is much more pleasant than a dried one.</li>
      <li>so nice to have something for people who are sensitive to fragrance</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly ..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve added a few drops of fragrance oil - choose something safe for use on the body and that will not irritate your skin and you&#x27;ve created your own scented moisturizer.    </li>
      <li>Smooth and gentle oil for the skin, easily washed off and far from greasy.</li>
      <li>After many seasons of unsuccessful testing of various lotions, potions, creams &amp; such, I tried Neutrogena unscented/fragrance-free Body Oil - which when used after EVERY SINGLE shower/bath, is great.</li>
      <li>the product is excellente, the problem was that this item was sent packaged with a book and other stuff, the oil was not well sealled and liked inside and ruined the book the book is still usable</li>
      <li>And it washes out easily with my regular shampoo and does not leave my hair greasy.  </li>
      <li>This product is so basic, it&#x27;s easy to overlook in favor of others with fancier packaging and bolder claims.  </li>
      <li>It helps you to stay a little bit warm.</li>
      <li>This formula is so light, you can put it into a mister bottle so you can get your back without help!  </li>
      <li>This oil is thinner than baby oil, does not make my skin feel as moist and leaves my face really shiny, unlike baby oil.</li>
      <li>This is the best weekly or semi-weekly moisturizing mask for my hair - I use a spray bottle to help get it evenly from root to tip, and then I wrap my hair in a towel or slick it into a tight bun and let it sit for hours.  </li>
      <li>It is good as a bath oil too (well, if it&#x27;s a bathtub you either don&#x27;t share or religiously wash down after every use).</li>
      <li>I added a little bit of jasmine perfume oil and now i have two 8.5 ounces bottles of my favorite scent.</li>
      <li>It has become more and more difficult to find in the stores and I am thankful for not having to search store after store for a product that works so well for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but it is suposed to be a new item,</li>
      <li>My favorite use is for my incredibly dry hair - I have naturally curly hair that can be coarse and frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I suffer from mild eczema in wintertime, and if I do not keep &#x27;ahead&#x27; of it, it soon becomes \\&quot;less than mild\\&quot; requiring drugs which I loathe.</li>
      <li>I smooth a little of this on after a shower - it instantly hydrates and no oily residue</li>
      <li>Only complaint is that the oil is so fine that it leaks through the cap.</li>
      <li>I live in Taos which is very dry</li>

    <li> Love this unscented oil for its silky, smooth and lightweight texture. It absorbs quickly ..However it&lt;br /&gt;it difficult to find the unscented version...glad to have bought it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> the product is excellente, the problem was that this item was sent packaged with a book and other stuff, the oil was not well sealled and liked inside and ruined the book the book is still usable but it is suposed to be a new item,</li>
    <li> Smooth and gentle oil for the skin, easily washed off and far from greasy. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself.  Had used it several years ago and had trouble finding it locally.  Used immediately after a show and your skin will feel great!</li>
    <li> This body oil has been around for years and I have used it for years.  I was glad to see it available from Amazon.  It keeps skin well moisturized, even through winter when overheated rooms and outdoor chill take their toll.</li>
    <li> Big Mama likes it and claims it delivers the goods. I do not use this kind of stuff because I am too macho (just kidding around) but I do realize that a smooth skin is much more pleasant than a dried one. 4 Stars for Neutrogena Body Oil, Fragrance Free, 8.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2) !</li>
    <li> I suffer from mild eczema in wintertime, and if I do not keep &#x27;ahead&#x27; of it, it soon becomes \\&quot;less than mild\\&quot; requiring drugs which I loathe. After many seasons of unsuccessful testing of various lotions, potions, creams &amp; such, I tried Neutrogena unscented/fragrance-free Body Oil - which when used after EVERY SINGLE shower/bath, is great. Some seasons I manage not to get an outbreak at all. Lightyears more effective than baby oil or any lotion I&#x27;ve every tried (and I have tried them all). It is good as a bath oil too (well, if it&#x27;s a bathtub you either don&#x27;t share or religiously wash down after every use). I don&#x27;t like scent/perfume, but the sesame scent isn&#x27;t bad nor overpowering - and it costs less (grrr - because it is available in larger container), so I tend to mix them because I\\&quot;m cheap. My family objects to the sesame smell in shared bathroom, however.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years I love it and I am alergic to many fragrances and am so pleased I can get it at Amazon most places carry the perfumed version</li>
    <li> It does not smell like sesame oil at all, which is good. Not like the smell of food. It actually has a very pleasant sensual smell. Oil is not too thick. Nice to apply after a bath, but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing. Wife and I are using it especially more often during the winter. It helps you to stay a little bit warm. Helps your skin to keep it from drying. Not bad to use for massage, but kinda expensive for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Wonderful to have a fragrance free body oil that smells and feels good. Wish more good products were made for those of us allergic to fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because it was supposed to absorb into the skin. I use baby oil now but by the end of the day my skin feels dry again. This oil is thinner than baby oil, does not make my skin feel as moist and leaves my face really shiny, unlike baby oil. The only thing I did like about it was that it is fragrance free and does not interfere with my cologne.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years which was suggested by my doctor.  It has become more and more difficult to find in the stores and I am thankful for not having to search store after store for a product that works so well for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I added a little bit of jasmine perfume oil and now i have two 8.5 ounces bottles of my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> so nice to have something for people who are sensitive to fragrance</li>
    <li> I smooth a little of this on after a shower - it instantly hydrates and no oily residue</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and don&#x27;t want to do without it.  However, I meant to order 2 and ended up with 5 so I had to give several away.</li>
    <li> This is the only body oil I have found that does not cause an allergic reaction.  if you have dry skin and problems finding something that works I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is so basic, it&#x27;s easy to overlook in favor of others with fancier packaging and bolder claims.  This humble bottle of oil packs a lot of punch, do not estimate what it can do for you!  The fact that it is unscented makes it a versatile addition to your personal care routine.    Primarily, this is a great moisturizer.  You can apply it to damp skin.  It absorbs into one&#x27;s skin almost immediately.  Don&#x27;t forget those rough patches on your elbows and knees!  I have combination skin, so while I do not use it for an emulsifying cleanser, in the winter I do get dry patches at the corners of my mouth, and this fixes that little problem as well.    It does not smell like food, so it will not interfere with your favorite fragrance.      My favorite use is for my incredibly dry hair - I have naturally curly hair that can be coarse and frizzy.  This is the best weekly or semi-weekly moisturizing mask for my hair - I use a spray bottle to help get it evenly from root to tip, and then I wrap my hair in a towel or slick it into a tight bun and let it sit for hours.  I&#x27;ve even gone out to run errands with a neat little bun and the oil doing it&#x27;s thing, so convenient!  And it washes out easily with my regular shampoo and does not leave my hair greasy.  It helps with my itchy scalp, too.    This formula is so light, you can put it into a mister bottle so you can get your back without help!  I&#x27;ve added a few drops of fragrance oil - choose something safe for use on the body and that will not irritate your skin and you&#x27;ve created your own scented moisturizer.    Great stuff!</li>
    <li> A very mild smelling, non-greasy moisturizing body oil. The bottle lasts a long time as a little goes a long way. Keeps my skin from drying out - especially the lower legs. I also use it on my feet and massage it into my cuticles. I recommend Neutrogena body oil for anyone prone to dry skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for itchy skin. I live in Taos which is very dry so I needed something badly. Also, I don&#x27;t like fragrance and it was a delight to find fragrance-free and its not too oily. Use it after a shower while still wet and then pat dry or put it in the bath water. Feels great.</li>
    <li> I could not find this unscented body oil in the store. All the stores only carry the ones with fragrance.</li>
    <li> This unscented, fragrance free oil, works great.  It moisturizes without feeling too oily.  It&#x27;s light and penetrates quickly.  Easy for after shower or to give massages. Best to shop around for this one.  Prices vary at Walmart (in stores) and I&#x27;ve found it through drugstore.com as well, less expensive at both these places.</li>
    <li> I love the Fragrance-Free version of this oil. I use it instead of a skin moisturizer.  Only complaint is that the oil is so fine that it leaks through the cap.</li>
