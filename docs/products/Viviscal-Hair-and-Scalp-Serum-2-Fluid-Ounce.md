    <li> This product is amazing. I had a problem with hair loss related to stress and lost approximately 40% of my hair. At first I tried rogain for women, but it provoked more hair loss and I became desperate to try anything, something that would bring my hair back. I found Viviscal at the local pharmacy, and after a week of applying this product i stopped loosing hair. After two more weeks I can seek its of new hair. And I definitely buying more of this stuff, because it works for me like nothing else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the thickness and softness of my hair since I began using Viviscal Hair and Scalp Serum.  I really like the results.  I&#x27;m not losing as much hair as I was before, my hair has more volume and strength after using it for about two months.</li>
    <li> We all love this hair cream. Me, my husband, my two daughters and also my son, we all use this cream and we all are happy and satisfied with the outcome. Even though we have different types of skin and hair this product is equally effective. In the past we use to have different types of hair creams. Specially me and my daughters. But this product changed that eventually.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I can’t use many skin related applications because of my extra sensitive skin. But this all natural product do no harm at all. I didn’t even feel a scratch ever since I have begun to use this awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply too. I don’t even feel it over my hair throughout the day. The product is totally free of sticky stuffs. I hate hair creams with such effects. Such products leave greasy feeling. But with this product I have never felt it even after hours of work under the sun.&lt;br /&gt;This  all natural product is full of nutrients needed for a healthy hair. Our family is a living proof for that. We all have strong, healthy looking hairs. Anyway I highly recommend you to use this product as preciously as described. That way you shall have a optimum result.</li>
