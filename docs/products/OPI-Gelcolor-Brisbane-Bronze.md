      <li>I have a lot of OPI colors and tis one is my favorite.</li>

      <li>The color was a bit darker than the top.</li>
      <li>I mixed it with some coral gelcolor polish to create the perfect color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wear it most of the time.</li>

      <li>Easy to apply, and lasts/</li>
      <li>Overall it performs/wears great.</li>
      <li>Love the intense color.</li>
      <li>Highly regarded :)</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that the product needed special equipment to seal the polish.</li>
      <li>Definately worth the money for this product.  </li>
      <li>These are much thicker then the sensationail I tried but lasts much better and really strengthens my nails.</li>
      <li>OPI colors never disappoint, I bought a gel curing light and a few of OPI&#x27;s colors and have had beautiful gel manicures for the last 6 months...</li>
      <li>For some reason this polish doesn&#x27;t chip or peel as fast as other OPI gel polishes I own.</li>
      <li>So far this is my favorite neutral color-very frosty-hides imperfections and small chips-was able to go 3 weeks before changing.</li>
      <li>Such a sexy color and yet subtle enough to work in, what is not to love!</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a nice product to say the least.</li>
      <li>but I think I found my new polish.  </li>
      <li>I ordered a few colors and so far this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Regular nail polish barely lasted 2 days-what an improvement!</li>

<li> This is the nicest nail polish color I have purchased in a long time!</li>
<li> Really pretty color but takes about 4 thin coats to get desired color.</li>
<li> Get the base and top coat products.  </li>
<li> My complexion is brown so this presented as a little bland.  </li>
<li> It is expensive but the results last two weeks.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s more gold than the website shows, with a bit of glitter to it, so it&#x27;s quite neutral without being boring.  </li>
<li> but no more!</li>
<li> No more 30 plus tip at the nail salon!!  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive for one bottle of polish.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sad this one is going away.</li>

    <li> So far this is my favorite neutral color-very frosty-hides imperfections and small chips-was able to go 3 weeks before changing. These are much thicker then the sensationail I tried but lasts much better and really strengthens my nails. They have ridges and split lengthwise but no more! Longest they&#x27;ve ever been.Regular nail polish barely lasted 2 days-what an improvement! Love OPI</li>
    <li> This is a wonderfully versatile color.  It&#x27;s more gold than the website shows, with a bit of glitter to it, so it&#x27;s quite neutral without being boring.  Definitely good for day or evening.</li>
    <li> Really pretty color but takes about 4 thin coats to get desired color.</li>
    <li> This is Superior polish and the color is amazing. It&#x27;s long wearing and the color matches just about anything I wear.</li>
    <li> Color is a shimmery bronze neutral shade. I like it, fours stars given because to get the desired color saturation, I did have to apply 3 coats. (I prefer only two coats of gel color).</li>
    <li> Beautiful, rich color.  Easy to apply.  Wears the best of any gel polish on the market. Great price for a really great product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> U will love this product. It&#x27;s expensive for one bottle of polish. But it&#x27;s a nice product to say the least. Invest in the polish. Great addition to your polish collection ladies. Make sure you have a great uv curing lamp to accompany the polish.</li>
    <li> This is the nicest nail polish color I have purchased in a long time! Its really beautiful! I have a lot of OPI colors and tis one is my favorite. I wear it most of the time.</li>
    <li> Any polish by OPI exceeds expectations. I&#x27;m sad this one is going away.</li>
    <li> This color is amazing!!! The color on the monitor does it no justice.  It&#x27;s very shiny and builds well with a few layers.  I used gelish before but I think I found my new polish.  OPI gel is very easy to apply, the brush size was perfect and was a good size bottle as well.  I can&#x27;t wait to build my OPI gel color collection.  No more 30 plus tip at the nail salon!!  Definately worth the money for this product.  Highly regarded :)</li>
    <li> The color is as shown, which was too orange for me.  I mixed it with some coral gelcolor polish to create the perfect color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the OPI gelcolors last  longer than the CND shellacs.  I am going to buy the OPI basecoat next time and see if that extends the life of the polish even futher.</li>
    <li> Neutral but still a color.  Goes with everything.  Went on well and stays on.  Get the base and top coat products.  Don&#x27;t forget the OPI bonding agent.  It is expensive but the results last two weeks.</li>
    <li> Such a sexy color and yet subtle enough to work in, what is not to love! The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite out of all of the OPI gel colors I&#x27;ve tried. Color is great and staying power is even better. For some reason this polish doesn&#x27;t chip or peel as fast as other OPI gel polishes I own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started doing gel nails at home. I ordered a few colors and so far this is my favorite. Color very  true to the photo. Two coats covered well.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The consistency and application were both very smooth.  The line has a great reputation.  This was easy to put on and lasted well.  It was just not the best color for me.  My complexion is brown so this presented as a little bland.  Overall it performs/wears great.</li>
    <li> OPI colors never disappoint, I bought a gel curing light and a few of OPI&#x27;s colors and have had beautiful gel manicures for the last 6 months...huge savings over the salon!</li>
    <li> Just had my nail tech put this on my fingers &amp; toes.  It looks awesome and she swears it will last and last.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that the product needed special equipment to seal the polish.</li>
    <li> If you want a &#x27;guaranteed&#x27; gift for you wife, buy her 4 or 5 of her favorite colors along with the remover and the rest of the OPI kit. Trust me on this...there is good reason professionals use this stuff EXCLUSIVELY!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color and with a glitter polish on top is shines. Love the intense color.</li>
    <li> The color was a bit darker than the top. BUT I love it!!!! Great neutral color. Easy to apply, and lasts/</li>
