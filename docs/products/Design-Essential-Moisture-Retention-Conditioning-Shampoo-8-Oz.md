I am a mixed cuban mexican and my hair is so thick and curly and i relax it and i have to part my hair in sections just to wash it plus my hair is right below my shoulder blades.

    <li> I began using the product after watching several Loc videos by Damian Walter. He suggested trying his system which includes the shampoo and moisturizing conditioner.  I was hesitant at first because I had bought into the idea that Locs couldn&#x27;t be conditioned. I am so glad I decided to buy the product because not only have I seen a considerable amount of growth using his system by my Locs have grown a noticeable amount in the last month or so!!!! It is worth the money. The only issue I had initially is that it does not suds up like the drugs store brands on the first wash yet,, it feels cleaner; evermore so when I use a clarifying shampoo first.</li>
