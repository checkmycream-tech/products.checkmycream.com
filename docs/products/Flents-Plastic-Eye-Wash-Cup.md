      <li>I do not know if I received a new item vs being used or returned.</li>
      <li>The clear portion of the seal was completely open/broken and detached from the main package material.</li>

<li> They really don&#x27;t import any other thing of importance except our addiction to importation has made funds available to put together a military force which may mean the sinking of our aircraft carriers or shoot down of so-called spy planes or BOOMER nukes heading our way.  </li>

<li> The shape of the cup is wrong - it does not fit to the eye so that you would be able to wash the eye when you hold the head horizontaly - the liquid runs out of the cup.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are too stiff to fit the eyes contour.</li>
    <li> They work good and are solidly made. Useful to have in your medical kit just in case.</li>
    <li> Great product, just the right size.</li>
    <li> I tried using this tonight and it did not help as I wanted it to. I am still stuck with rinsing my eye with no help from this cup.</li>
    <li> Mainly i forget to use it every day . There in noting wrong with this product . that why its okay.regards shahla hajarian</li>
    <li> Every well- stocked medicine chest should contain an eye wash cup.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you only need it once, you will be so relieved that you had it.</li>
    <li> I needed this and will use - but given shipping it&#x27;s a wash on function/value.  I need these in multiple places for my dry eyes (and much cheaper than those rip and drip eye solutions.</li>
    <li> This eyecup did not fit tightly around my eye, and leaked solution all over my face. I threw it away after one use.</li>
    <li> This cup works better than the normal flat cups.  They can withstand hot water.  I bought this to go along with Dr. Christopher&#x27;s eye wash and we have to use boiling water to mix the tincture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product over any other eye cup.</li>
    <li> Fits the eye well, no leaks or drips. I like the tint, because when you tip it up, you are inevitably staring at your ceiling lights. Great purchase, I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong item</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a glass eye wash cup but couldn&#x27;t find it so I ordered another. Decided on this because of the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did!!! Upon first opening I dropped it on my hard floor. The glass probably would have broken but this didn&#x27;t . When I first used it I was very excited that it fit around my whole eye. Nothing leaked out either. I was used to doing it over the sink to catch all the leaking but it didn&#x27;t !!! Since it fit perfectly... It also didn&#x27;t suction either. Very pleased and would order again and recommend to anyone. Stuff can get in your eyes when you least expect it. I&#x27;ve gotten toothpaste. Pepper ( like salt and pepper) definitely worth having in the house</li>
    <li> Glad to find this product available through Amazon.  I was not able to find it locally and feel an eye wash cup is an important component for both our home and camping first aid kits.</li>
    <li> I believe an eye cup needs to fit within the eye socket to form a leak-proof seal.  This one is much too wide for my eyes.  Width of this cup is 1 7/8 inches.  An approximate measure of the width of my eye socket is 1 1/2 inches.  There is no way to move it around to make it fit as one reviewer suggests.  Perhaps a flexible plastic cup would be closer to the claim \\&quot;one size fits all.\\&quot;  I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> I got this one based on the reviews, but it doesn&#x27;t work very well for me and the water drips when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;I still use it as I haven&#x27;t found another one to replace it, but I wish they could imporve the design.</li>
    <li> The clear portion of the seal was completely open/broken and detached from the main package material. I do not know if I received a new item vs being used or returned.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye wash cup because sometime&#x27;s my husband get&#x27;s something in his eye&#x27;s while bike riding, good to have around the house to wash his eye&#x27;s out. Great item and very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great gadget for flushing eyes.  I always seem to have particles of mascara or eye liner in my eyes after removing makeup and this really helps to remove it.  It&#x27;s especially good for kids when they get something in their eyes since they usually can&#x27;t sit still long enough for parents to look.  Also, this is larger than the older, glass style I had years ago so it&#x27;s more comfortable to use and safer since it won&#x27;t shatter if dropped.  I have one in the medicine cabinet and one in the travel first-aid kit.</li>
    <li> I am really happy to be able to get these wash cup because I had a hard time looking all the pharmacies and non of them carry it.</li>
    <li> It works well. Gets a good seal. Jack like.</li>
    <li> This eyewash cup works okay. I have to widen my eye, as if I was going to put in a monocle, to help secure it around my eye. But then it sometimes still leaks. It seems like a soft plastic would work better, something that bends.</li>
    <li> Well this does the obvious and performs well. My review is basically to explain that it&#x27;s sturdy. Our puppy found the unopened envelope this was shipped in. She tore it apart. Along with the product packaging. The paper packaging parts were shredded. I was afraid the eye wash had been demolished as well but I found it four days later on the opposite side of the house in another room being batted about by one of our cats. I have no idea how it got there but there wasn&#x27;t a scratch, tooth mark, or crack on it. I have no carpet so it survived a beating.</li>
    <li> just perfect  for  my  eye</li>
    <li> It is hard to find eye cups but Amazon has a selection of them.  I use this plastic eye cup when I travel and it is perfect!</li>
    <li> I have given this eyecup to someone else who has eye problems to use as an eyewash with Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Eyebright formula.  Keep selling it.</li>
    <li> The shape of the cup is wrong - it does not fit to the eye so that you would be able to wash the eye when you hold the head horizontaly - the liquid runs out of the cup.</li>
    <li> These should be a must-have for every household, and if you happen to drop it, ( Its not glass ) !!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it was so difficult to find an eye wash cup. I went to multiple pharmacies and nobody had them. This one works fine and I like it although I still may buy a glass one if I find one as they can be sterilized. Otherwise, I recommend this. Don&#x27;t waste your time at pharmacies, just order one here from Amazon</li>
    <li> Perfect for cleaning eyes. Safe, secure around the eye and does exactly as it says it will. I recommend strongly....for any regular eye wash and to always have in a medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Perfect shape for me, although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the best fit for everyone.  Gets the job done and easy to clean. Durable, lightweight, better for traveling with than glass.</li>
    <li> just the right size also don&#x27;t go to wal mart for one they sell 6 in package at a hugh price.</li>
    <li> Fits my eye socket perfectly.</li>
    <li> Another Chinese made import.  It&#x27;s about time Chinese made products are forbidden to enter this country either through slight of hand via Canada or Mexico.  The only thing of importance is the Boeing wings (I think) being made in China for the 787.  They really don&#x27;t import any other thing of importance except our addiction to importation has made funds available to put together a military force which may mean the sinking of our aircraft carriers or shoot down of so-called spy planes or BOOMER nukes heading our way.  If we had never allowed ChiCom imports in the first place, they would still be a backward 4th world country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would also need to advise Japan no imports from you either if your products have ChiCom components.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i needed.Works as described. Perfect for the eyewash i bought. I like its shape and fits my eyes perfectly.</li>
    <li> This eye cup is ok but not great.  Unfortunately the shape makes it hard to hold to the eye just right and takes several tries before getting it right.  If they had done some testing before finalizing the design it would have been better.</li>
    <li> This really helps wash foreign material out of your eyes.</li>
    <li> Again, I was amazed that this product is not available at your local pharmacies.  I visited five to no avail in two states.  Seems to be made well and should last and work as purported.</li>
    <li> Perfect for eye wash. Your eye feels great after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;Great delivery and packaging from seller. Keep up the good work.</li>
