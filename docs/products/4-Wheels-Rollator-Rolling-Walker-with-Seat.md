      <li>Other companies sell the product for much more.</li>
      <li>she loves her new way of getting around , she is doing some real walking now....</li>
      <li>In looking at several of this type of thing, it seems that most use a similar braking system</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than more expensive walkers on site.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We were actually quite surprised in the quality and workmanship of this Rollator since we ordered over the internet and never saw it before we got it.  We normally like to see and touch things we buy and ordering this on line was a new experience for us.  My wife has had 4 major back surgeries and her mobility was almost nil, but once we received the Rollator she has been able to get around much better and she is up to about 1/2 mile each time we walk.  We ordered the one with the seat so she could rest along our walks, but the dynamics of the way it is built makes it so she can go a lot further between rests.  The last two walks she didn&#x27;t even have to sit down.  Our next purchase will probably be the cup holder for the Rollator so she can carry some water along on our walks.  Thank you for making such a wonderful product..</li>
    <li> Amazing buy and I love my walker.  It is so much better than the one I got in my physical therapy.  I got a better deal here than if I&#x27;d used my Medicaid at the medical supply pharmacy!</li>
    <li> Mom is 94 yrs old and 89 lbs and the cart is light and easy to pick up. will go places bigger ones will not. And the brakes work real good it is a plus for older people when they try to use it to help them get up from the couch</li>
    <li> With this, I can \\&quot;Walk\\&quot; without difficulty.  Easy to assemble; and I can turn corners \\&quot;On a dime\\&quot;.  I love it...  Also the vendor shipped quickly and I received it 3 days before  they forecast.....</li>
    <li> Let me get to the points.  Pros: It was easy for my husband to put together.         Lightweight     Cons: Wobbles (maximum weight is 225 and the person I bought it for is 200lbs)        The basket is underneath the seat so you have to get up to reach items in        basket.        When you fold the walker you have to remove the basket.        There is a string you have to pull when you want to close the walker              and then sometimes you have to hold onto the string so it won&#x27;t come              flying open.    Overall I would recommend buying this walker if you had to buy a cheap walker really fast. Otherwise spend a little bit more and invest in something else.</li>
    <li> thank you for making this so efficient and easy. my rollator came well packaged, in great shape and easy to assemble. it arrived as scheduled and gives me more options to be in the world. many thanks and peace.</li>
    <li> This walker was easily assembled, light weight and a good value for the money.  I took it to FL and carted it in and out of a van with ease. It is sufficiently sturdy to rely on to carry my weight both when sitting on it or pushing it.  I am very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still rolling and still very happy with this item.  Took it on a bus trip to West Coast and had much handling but still holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;11/20/12</li>
    <li> This is a great buy. It was everything that they said it would be. I was very impressed. It&#x27;s even better than I exepected. The price was great and it arrived very quickly. I did alot ofr comparison and this is a great buy. very easy to use and assembly is not to difficult, although it&#x27;s not super easy either.</li>
    <li> I like this walker for my husband but I would have thought it would have locking brakes.  I will have to make sure in the future that this is a feature.  People who use these walkers like to sit on them and there needs to be a locking mechanism so it doesn&#x27;t roll</li>
    <li> This seller sent out a product with a faulty weld so that it broke before anyone got the chance to use the item.  We wrote the seller, through Amazon, and asked them how they wished to handle this and they have never responded.  We wrote another email to them, again through Amazon, asking them not to ignore the problem and to please respond to our email.  They have not responded to that either. It is looking like we are just stuck.  One star is generous.    Item: Rollator with Dual Brakes by Rollators Light Weight in Burgundy</li>
    <li> Totally satisfied and happy with my new walker. I am pending spine surjury and this is a great relief to me and a huge improvement over the dinesaur one I had. I would highly recommend it. I love it! It has made my life easier already! Can&#x27;t wait to use it after the surjury , the seat is a well needed asset, I use it for a tray to transport my food and drinks on, as well as to sit and rest while walking.</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with this product.  It gives her a sense of control that she didn&#x27;t have before.  We needed some extra services from the supplier and were treated very, very well.  They were responsive and prompt in taking care of us.  We are considering buying another one for use on our second floor.  The rollator is lightweight and rather easy to transport.</li>
    <li> Item came very quick.  Rollator is beautiful and made with good quality parts.  Wheels very nice and quiet, plus very sturdy.  Really love it!!</li>
    <li> Other companies sell the product for much more. Thought it might be cheaply made due to the price. Quality product. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I did not need the large Rollator, this one is very wide; I know there are smaller width ones.  Other than that the product arrived safely and is good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for an old friend who needs help in walking. Works very well and is easy to work with. I had previously bought a heavy weight walker but it was a bit heavy to deal with in putting in car for trips. This light weight one works well. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition, in record time (next day).  Easy to assemble and my mother in law loves it.  Candy apple red, bucket seat, disc brakes and even built in storage!  Too bad Pontiac is only a memory, this will be the next generation GTO for us boomers.</li>
    <li> Good product---well priced; lower than many others I found online that were very similar.  I feel the tax and the shipping and handling were a bit high but, once again, the product is good.</li>
    <li> Walker arrived in a timely manner, and in perfect condition. Exactly as described. Best price I found anywhere. Some very easy assembly required.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my granny and we were both thrilled at the quality of the product and excellent service! We received free shipping and this product arrived within 2 days!! We were very impressed by the affordable price and incredible quality. I would highly recommend this product and company to all my friends and family and everyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, is little heavy, use a good space in the car and id so fragil with handlers (with brakes), not too practical for push the patient ( from the back) when you do that, you dont hit the patient feet.  Very nice color ( red) and is easy to handle by the patient and supports very good her weight.</li>
    <li> The item I ordered was for my sister.  It arrived, and she is very happy with product.        Thank you,    Dian D. Jones</li>
    <li> First of all the stated weight is incorrect, with the packaging it comes to 26 lbs as marked on the carton;  so the unit itself is not as lightweight as advertised, which could make a difference to someone unable to handle (fold up, put into car/trunk, etc) a heavier walker. Also, it states the brakes lock and we were unable to determine how that is possible (to lock the brakes). I would be interested in knowing if this was a problem for anyone else. Overall the unit was sturdy and the wheels rolled easily, but ultimately my Dad decided it was not for him. The return process was fairly simple.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the comfort of the seat and the rolling is a breeze. Recovering from back surgery made a stable platform a must, and this roller cart is well suited for this. The brakes hold well when properly adjusted and the acceessories are convenient.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are very pleased with this product.  It arrived within two days and was adjustable to the height we needed.  It is easy to manipulate and sturdy enough to be a good support</li>
    <li> good product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom who had knee and back problems. I was worried because she is a little heavy, but this chair has held up fine. She&#x27;s had it for a few months, and she takes it on the bus and throughout the house with no problems. I ended up getting her two: one for the house and one for travel. The deat is an extra bonus for when she needs to rest.</li>
    <li> Yes it is a Medline but Amazon has the \\&quot;Product Description\\&quot; as a 300 lb. weight capacity , Medline won&#x27;t accept the return because it was bought through \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot;, they said to call Medline for returns so its just a run around from both parties,the unit appears to be very nice itself just wanted a higher weight cap.</li>
    <li> WE got this for a friend that could not walk alone. now she is out and about with out help. she loves her new way of getting around , she is doing some real walking now....she is very happy with it...</li>
    <li> This is generally a nicely made product, quite sturdy. Good value, but, we ran into a problem with the brakes.  They work well in most circumstances but can be less effective when trying to lock them. Adjusting them several times helped but never fully resolved the problem. (The manual is of some help, the manufacturer was essentially unhelpful.)   In looking at several of this type of thing, it seems that most use a similar braking system so I don&#x27;t know if any other unit would be any better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this walker for my mother, who had recently fractured her hip.  It is a well designed and quality made walker with a seat attached which is a needed function.  It assembles easily and can be adjusted for height--it even has brakes!  My mother loves it and it enabled mobility immediately.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Was missing a bolt. Was able to buy a similar one at hardware store.  Not exact but works.</li>
    <li> a good household item. it&#x27;s very helpful when my lower back has the problem</li>
    <li> I bought this walker for my mother last Christmas (2011).  She loves it.  However, this year a couple of her neighbors asked why doesn&#x27;t hers have a back rest.  My son put it together and I was with him.  There were no other parts in the box, so we had no idea that it should have a back rest.  My mother checked the manual that came with it.  There were two pictures on it, the picture on the front showed the walker without the back rest.  The picture on the back showed it with the back rest.  When I looked up the discription on Amazon (where I purchased it) the discription said there is a back rest and of course it&#x27;s been a year so there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it except buy a back rest separately for $30.00 from the same company.  What a rip off.  The walker costed $73.00 already and nothing said that the back rest had to be purchased separately.  If I buy it I will not buy it from the company I got the walker from.  I was so upset when I found this out that I really only wanted to rate it with one star.  I only considered 3 stars because my mother does like it, eventhou she keeps complaining to me about it should have a back rest.  It&#x27;s sold by Eva Medical Group and shipped from JDC Supplies.  I will never again order from these companies.</li>
    <li> This walker is perfect for my 140 pound mom. She always seems to be on a mission and now she can get there a whole lot faster. I ordered it Tuesday morning and it was here by Wednesday afternoon. (I must live down the street from the shipping site as that is ridiculously fast...but not as fast as Mom.) It was easy to put together...no wobble...and all the pieces were included. The burgundy color is just sassy enough to make all the other old ladies a tiny bit jealous...or maybe it was the big orange flowers I duct taped on the thing so she wouldn&#x27;t lose it. In any case it&#x27;s a pretty sweet ride (glide?) for my sweet mom. Lucky. As far as I know she hasn&#x27;t taken it off any jumps but I&#x27;ll update if that happens. Trust me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than more expensive walkers on site. This is probably the best experience I&#x27;ve EVER had with Amazon!  And that&#x27;s saying a lot.  Product was better than I thought it worth be.  Shipping is super fast.  This exact item is $299.95 at the hospital supply store in my city.  I highly recommend this product. It makes my mom able to go where and when ever she wants.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 82 year old Dad.  Loves it!  Lightweight enough to lift in car, yet sturdy enough to push and &#x27;walk&#x27; (or practically &#x27;run&#x27;) behind!</li>
    <li> I wanted the best so I bought this Rollator. If you&#x27;re going to spend the money anyway, you should spend just a little more and get the best available. It&#x27;s a bad feeling when you realize you&#x27;ve got a second-class item when youj&#x27;ve spent almost what the best cost. The large wheels, sturdiness and ease of use makes this the one to have. An electric motor would be fun but it wouldn&#x27;t be a walker anymore, would it?</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and a great product.  I bought it for my mom who was a  little worried about using a walker but she fell in love with it and uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> I have been very lucky.  All items were superior quality</li>
    <li> Got his for my mother-in-law.  She used it everyday.  It is well made and comes fully assembled.  The brakes work good.  She likes the fact that she can also use it as a chair if she gets tired while moving around.  A good investment in safety and comfort.</li>
    <li> Love it I still used it I am very pleased.</li>
