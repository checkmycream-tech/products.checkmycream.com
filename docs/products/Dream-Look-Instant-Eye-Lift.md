      <li>I even like it more</li>
      <li>These are shiny and are more visible.</li>
      <li>Can be used much more than once.</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;m confident in time i can get them all sold</li>

      <li>Better diagrams would be helpful.</li>
      <li>am glad</li>
      <li>Okay, here&#x27;s the difference....</li>
      <li>I tried many times to apply these.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>it , you will love it too</li>
      <li>eyes are much more opened</li>
      <li>You must use the cream they give you to be able to move it a bit if needed.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well or if this product even works</li>
      <li>I just love this product...</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING!</li>
      <li>I have worn them for years, i think they make me look much more alert.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
      <li>(so you can easily see them on your eye lid) and they don&#x27;t stick as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are easy to afix and stay put.  </li>
      <li>And its easy@</li>
      <li>they are easy to use and easy to take off.</li>
      <li>THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST LITTLE PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED.  </li>
      <li>The strips are comfortable and you don&#x27;t know they are there.</li>
      <li>WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON, THEY SMOOTH OUT THE WRINKLE</li>
      <li>I have used the same eye lifts before and was happy with the results</li>
      <li>Good to use when you go out at night to places that are dim but not during the daytime because even putting make up on they are visible.</li>
      <li>its original texture.</li>
      <li>I takes practice to place them in the right place, but once you do, you will be amazed!</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;eye lifter\\&quot; tape is not really visible when you&#x27;re wearing it which is great, since I was concerned it would be noticeable to others that I had applied something to my eyelids.</li>
      <li>I will never understand why when one has a good product, they tinker with it in trying to improve it &amp; come out w/ a lesser version &amp; just go with it.</li>
      <li>When I put them on I can feel them and they are very visible without the makeup, even more so with makeup.</li>
      <li>It might work even better if they were just a bit longer, but overall I am pleased.</li>
      <li>This product works exactly like it claims!  </li>
      <li>but I feel that is because they are not doing it right.  </li>
      <li>If placed right in the crease of your eyelid...</li>
      <li>This product is exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>This seems to work pretty well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and love it.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try this product when it was first introduced.</li>
      <li>Tips: Make sure to put it in the crease and a bit too the outside.</li>
      <li>but I decided to buy as it was not expensive compared to eyelid</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be in a hurry the first time</li>
      <li>My right eye lid has a drooping problem, so it really needs to be lifted.</li>
      <li>I am starting to get those eyelids that come with getting older and this product is so much better than having eyelid surgery.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and definitely works.  </li>
      <li>Dream Look Instant Eye Lift has easy application and removal.</li>
      <li>These are so easy to use and work instantly.</li>
      <li>I agree that this is a pretty decent product.  </li>
      <li>My droopy eyelids really opened up once I applied the strips.  </li>
      <li>Wish I had the money for the real thing, but its just like putting lenses on.</li>
      <li>and really didn&#x27;t do much for my eyes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, stays on all day, and gives me back my eyelid crease; however, their advertising/marketing schemes are a joke.  </li>
      <li>The strip is very noticeable and doesn&#x27;t stay on well.</li>
      <li>I much prefer &amp;#34;Easy Lift&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I am really enamored by this product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have much hope for them.</li>
      <li>got a bunch from d supplier, not selling as fast as i thought</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t really figure out how to use these.</li>
      <li>Yes, they changed the material, and I like it less: the plastic is shiny and more visible.  </li>
      <li>I think these work just as well - or better - as the much more expensive lifts.  </li>
      <li>You changed the sticking element in which the older version worked well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes a few minutes to get the hang of it, but once you do - it is so different and makes you feel quite good about yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The first box (Dream Look Instant Lift) had thin, barely visible strips that held beautifully.</li>
      <li>-first box (from TV commercial) had the sticky bottom down on paper and the top of eye-lift  had a &amp;#34;matt&amp;#34; finish.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My right eye has a mono-lid and my left eye has a bi-lid, to avoid doing radical surgery to even them out</li>
      <li>I  like the new improvements.</li>
      <li>Live and learn I quess.</li>
      <li>Not a fan of the new consistency of *either* the gel OR the strips.  </li>
      <li>I must say - it actually works and at first, you keep looking at yourself because it widens your eyes and makes you look</li>
      <li>I think they&#x27;re just old!  </li>
      <li>-second box (ordered from internet) had sticky bottom down on paper and the top of eye-lift has a &amp;#34;shiny-stiff&amp;#34</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes practice to find the right spot at first but dont give up , for me it works ust below the crease line witht he round edge up.</li>
      <li>Either they wouldn&#x27;t stick, or you could see them clearly, under make up and all.</li>
      <li>NATURALLY YOU HAVE TO LEARN THEIR USE.  </li>
      <li>Need help now in my 60&#x27;s to hold up the old lids.</li>
      <li>but I received boxes of the old version, which would also explain why the glue does not stick as well.  </li>
      <li>Im young looking to start with</li>
      <li>AND it doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive eyes...</li>
      <li>The result did not look natural at all for me.</li>
      <li>In it&#x27;s first productions the strips were made of a thin comfortable paper.</li>
      <li>It left my eyes droopier than normal for a 50 year old.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> While this product technically works, it is a different material than the same product I had purchased elsewhere.  My previous ones were a matt finish and blended in with my lid well.  These are shiny and are more visible.</li>
    <li> product worked well as expected.  It&#x27;s undectable when applied correctly.  I even like it more everytime I use it.  Period!</li>
    <li> Instantly lifted the droopy eyelids. Doesn&#x27;t last with sweat or a long day though.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well or if this product even works but I am actually very pleased. The \\&quot;eye lifter\\&quot; tape is not really visible when you&#x27;re wearing it which is great, since I was concerned it would be noticeable to others that I had applied something to my eyelids. Also I am very pleased that it stays on and in place (doesn&#x27;t shift around). It gives your eye lids a little lift. I will be buying more when I run out. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it is a bit pricey for  basically a product made of sticky plastic. But again, it does work!</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use and work instantly. Can be used much more than once. Wouldn&#x27;t want to go without them! And affordable too!!</li>
    <li> I went to the company&#x27;s website to purchase the product and ended up spending $41 for nothing due to dishonest business practices. The website is set up to mislead you into double ordering, and the order is submitted before you have a chance to review your cart and notice you have just been billed for a double order with double postage/handling. I immediately called the company to cancel one of the orders, but was told to call back in 48 hours when the order showed up in the system. When I called back, I was told the order already shipped. The next day, I received a call from the company to confirm my shipment address -- meaning the order had not in fact shipped as I was told. Still, I was told I couldn&#x27;t cancel the extra order. When I finally received the product, I tried it, and was very disappointed. Yes, it lifts your lid as advertised, but in so doing it creates big, deep wrinkles on the side of your eye which look worse. I called to get authorization to return both but was told I would only get $29 back of the $70 I was charged (despite the money-back guarantee)!!!! I would avoid this product and company at all costs.</li>
    <li> I must say - it actually works and at first, you keep looking at yourself because it widens your eyes and makes you look so awake!&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few minutes to get the hang of it, but once you do - it is so different and makes you feel quite good about yourself.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it for a lot of different occasions if not just for every day because I like the way it makes me feel!!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried others but these are so thin they do the job better.  They are easy to afix and stay put.  I get a little lift but that is enough</li>
    <li> Yes, they changed the material, and I like it less: the plastic is shiny and more visible.  But it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. AND it doesn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive eyes...so it&#x27;s still a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This product works exactly like it claims!  I&#x27;ll keep buying it and would recommend it to friends and anyone who has droopy eyelids.</li>
    <li> My droopy eyelids really opened up once I applied the strips.  I takes practice to place them in the right place, but once you do, you will be amazed!</li>
    <li> I  like the new improvements. I  wear these every day.  they are easy to use and easy to take off. They  are an instant eye lift.  I  look younger and less tired.</li>
    <li> I suffered a CAD back in November (Carotid Artery Dissection). It left my eyes droopier than normal for a 50 year old. Im young looking to start with but the droopy eyes were causing me to be tired and very, very depressed.  I researched getting a lid lift, but I couldn&#x27;t afford it and insurance wouldn&#x27;t pay either. THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING! Tips: Make sure to put it in the crease and a bit too the outside. Its like putting stickers on. Wish I had the money for the real thing, but its just like putting lenses on.</li>
    <li> I love these!!! I have worn them for years, i think they make me look much more alert. And its easy@</li>
    <li> I just love this product...I know there have been some bad reviews but I feel that is because they are not doing it right.  If placed right in the crease of your eyelid...you cannot see it at all.  You must use the cream they give you to be able to move it a bit if needed.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes are much more opened and my eyelid is not drooping as bad as it was.&lt;br /&gt;I also wear eye shadows with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try...I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> These are horrible.  I tried many times to apply these.  Either they wouldn&#x27;t stick, or you could see them clearly, under make up and all.</li>
    <li> A little too shiny, tape needs to be duller. They work great keep lids up though. They last a while</li>
    <li> Good to use when you go out at night to places that are dim but not during the daytime because even putting make up on they are visible.</li>
    <li> I have used the same eye lifts before and was happy with the results however the boxes I recently received with my new order are not good.  The strips are shinier than the ones I&#x27;ve used before (so you can easily see them on your eye lid) and they don&#x27;t stick as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the change in the texture of the strips I received (shinier now), I think the company may have improved the strips and made them less noticeable (i.e. less shiny) but I received boxes of the old version, which would also explain why the glue does not stick as well.  I think they&#x27;re just old!  So now I&#x27;m stuck with 5 boxes of lifts that I cannot use.</li>
    <li> I will never understand why when one has a good product, they tinker with it in trying to improve it &amp; come out w/ a lesser version &amp; just go with it. You changed the sticking element in which the older version worked well. I could leave on for days! I now find the lifts moving&amp;having to remove them midday--will be looking to switch to a better product now!</li>
    <li> did not solve the problem.  everytime I blinked the lift became visible.  would not buy again and would not recommend</li>
    <li> I agree that this is a pretty decent product.  I think a lot of the unfavorable use reviews are from people that aren&#x27;t using it correctly-it does take a few tries and patience. (I suspect placing it too low below the crease, or on skin that already has a moisturizer)  It&#x27;s comfortable, stays on all day, and gives me back my eyelid crease; however, their advertising/marketing schemes are a joke.  I ordered on-line, when they had a BOGO offer.  After a couple of weeks, I got one box, not two.  When I contacted them, they said that people got confused because the 2nd order was in the same box as the first one, and that I should have received 8 strips.  I did not, I only got 4, and told them so.  They apologized, and said they would send the 2nd order.  Weeks later, it has not arrived. That&#x27;s bad customer service, and surely won&#x27;t cultivate a repeat customer base.</li>
    <li> i have them in my shop now for sale. got a bunch from d supplier, not selling as fast as i thought but i&#x27;m confident in time i can get them all sold</li>
    <li> Easy to use and definitely works.  I am starting to get those eyelids that come with getting older and this product is so much better than having eyelid surgery.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, stays on and doesn&#x27;t shift and best of all you don&#x27;t even feel you&#x27;re wearing anything on you lids.  I suggest reading the directions and having some time to get used to applying them.  Don&#x27;t be in a hurry the first time or you may get frustrated and give up.</li>
    <li> I tried these on a whim. I didn&#x27;t have much hope for them. I should have just saved my money. The stickers were easy enough to get on, you have to use a little gel before applying. The result did not look natural at all for me. I threw them in the trash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and love it.  My right eye lid has a drooping problem, so it really needs to be lifted.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reordered this several times. It takes a few times of practice before you know the right placement. However, once you do, you&#x27;ll see a big difference. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results of the Dream Look Instant Eye lift and would&lt;br /&gt;recommend said item to others.</li>
    <li> I am really enamored by this product. It works and&lt;br /&gt;takes years off my appearance. I would give it 5 stars,&lt;br /&gt;however the product appears to be somewhat &amp;#34;re-formulated&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;from its original texture. Not as great as the originals,&lt;br /&gt;but still really good. Great investment considering&lt;br /&gt;the alternative!! (eyebrow lift)</li>
    <li> I always use eye lift strips. Do work,plus,saves expense and money and discomfort if had to have plastic surgery on eyelids!!!! Can&#x27;t go out now without them as they make such a difference.No more hoody eyes!! :-)</li>
    <li> I have used these eye lifters for quite a while and found them very good.  But the last batch I received is worthless!  The glue doesn&#x27;t stick and the ends begin to peel off almost immediately.  I am very disappointed.  And for someone who may be wanting to experiment -- you will get a wrong impression about how well eye lifters work by trying this product as it currently is.  Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Despite numerous tries, I simply could not find a way to apply them that looked natural.  I am sorry I purchased them.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the new consistency of *either* the gel OR the strips.  They are far too difficult to work with in their current configuration.  I much prefer &amp;#34;Easy Lift&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> My right eye has a mono-lid and my left eye has a bi-lid, to avoid doing radical surgery to even them out I decided to try this product when it was first introduced. In it&#x27;s first productions the strips were made of a thin comfortable paper. I couldn&#x27;t feel that I had it on and I could wear makeup over it with no problem. But this time that I got them online I was extremely disappointed. They&#x27;re thicker, stiff, and the material is plastic. When I put them on I can feel them and they are very visible without the makeup, even more so with makeup. Now I&#x27;m looking towards other products in hopes of continuing to avoid surgery. :(</li>
    <li> I think these work just as well - or better - as the much more expensive lifts.  So glad I tried these.  Need help now in my 60&#x27;s to hold up the old lids.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST LITTLE PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED.  WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON, THEY SMOOTH OUT THE WRINKLE AND THEY STAY ON UNTIL YOU TAKE OFF.  NATURALLY YOU HAVE TO LEARN THEIR USE.  VERY EASY.  I COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT THEM.</li>
    <li> I tried this product before when I bought it at CVS and it worked great. CVS didn&#x27;t carry it anymore so I found, which I thought was the same product, online for a cheaper price.  That was a mistake because I am very disappointed.  It&#x27;s definitely not the same product.  The strip is very noticeable and doesn&#x27;t stay on well. Maybe what I was sent were rejects or the imperfect ones.The box was a little smaller but still had the same look and everything else looked the same. Unfortunately I threw the box away because I would definitely return the product.  Live and learn I quess.</li>
    <li> They changed the material from a paper tape to hard plastic material. Very disappointed in the new product and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I was so happy with my first purchase of this product that when they ran out I decided to order more. The first box (Dream Look Instant Lift) had thin, barely visible strips that held beautifully. Perhaps they had complaints about them being difficult to work with, but for some bizarre reason they have changed the plastic. It is now thick, has a texture to it, and are very, very visible. Do not buy this product unless you want everyone looking at you to see thick strips of textured plastic on your eyelids! Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> These did not work with my droopy fat eyelids...All day my eyelids kept sticking to each other felt like I had glue on, and really didn&#x27;t do much for my eyes.</li>
    <li> First negative review I have ever written.  You can see the tapes on the eyes.  I even cut them to thin slivers thinking it would have helped but you can still see them.  I tried covering them with makeup, etc. still visible.</li>
    <li> Diffocult to learn how to apply but work somewhat.  I&#x27;d buy again to help with the problem of saggy lids.</li>
    <li> They sort of do what they claim but they are shiny and so clearly visible when you blink or look down.</li>
    <li> I was not sure about this product due to the mixed reviews but I decided to buy as it was not expensive compared to eyelid surgery.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad i both it!! I use it every day and I cant believe my cooworkers think i had surgery .Lol&lt;br /&gt;The best way to apply is to put make up on your eyes first, then apply the strips (no cream needed)&lt;br /&gt;It takes practice to find the right spot at first but dont give up , for me it works ust below the crease line witht he round edge up. I know now where to apply so it takes me two seconds...&lt;br /&gt;Try it , you will love it too</li>
    <li> works great and great price!</li>
    <li> This seems to work pretty well. You do see a difference. The strips are comfortable and you don&#x27;t know they are there. They do seem a little small. It might work even better if they were just a bit longer, but overall I am pleased.</li>
    <li> The first box of Dream Look Instant Eye Life that I ordered from TV commercial back last summer are totally different from the ones I received (same name &amp; company) around Thanksgiving.  I still have some left over in the first box and compared them with ones in the second box.  Okay, here&#x27;s the difference....&lt;br /&gt;  -first box (from TV commercial) had the sticky bottom down on paper and the top of eye-lift  had a &amp;#34;matt&amp;#34; finish.&lt;br /&gt;  -second box (ordered from internet) had sticky bottom down on paper and the top of eye-lift has a &amp;#34;shiny-stiff&amp;#34; finish which&lt;br /&gt;  in my opinion, are made from different materials.  The ones I ordered from here are impossible to work with on the lid...&lt;br /&gt;  plain &amp; simple.  Threw them in the trashcan!!!&lt;br /&gt;With the &amp;#34;matt&amp;#34; finish, they were invisible once applied.  With the shiny-stiff film, you could see them on your lid at a distance.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as advertised.  I will purchase this product again. Dream Look Instant Eye Lift has easy application and removal.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t really figure out how to use these. They are hard to handle and hard to position. Better diagrams would be helpful.</li>
