<li> Jones store closed I could not find this perfume in any other of the local stores, not even in Walgreens or Walmart, years later, it wasn&#x27;t until this year that my daughter told me to check Amazon to see if it was still being sold because Amazon has everything and to my surprise</li>
<li> I suffer from allergies and this fragrance does not effect me negatively in any manner</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re gonna fake a perfume why fake such an inexpensive one.</li>
<li> She is in a nursing home and unable to find this product in any store in our area.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>

    <li> The bottle was hand written with a paper label Sand &amp; sable does not have a label like that. If you&#x27;re gonna fake a perfume why fake such an inexpensive one. I don&#x27;t get it Thought this was a safe purchase.</li>
    <li> 3/22/11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Sand and Sable since it came on the market \\&quot;many\\&quot; years ago now and WOULD NOT use another product.  I suffer from allergies and this fragrance does not effect me negatively in any manner whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia A. Ferguson</li>
    <li> This perfume holds a very special memory for me, this was the first perfume I had ever received and it was given to me by my Grandmother.  Every time I wear this perfume it reminds me of that moment with her. The sent suited me well she told me and I have loved this perfume ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jones store closed I could not find this perfume in any other of the local stores, not even in Walgreens or Walmart, years later, it wasn&#x27;t until this year that my daughter told me to check Amazon to see if it was still being sold because Amazon has everything and to my surprise it was.  The sent has slightly changed from when I first received it back in the 1980s, it has become a little bit more subtle, not a bad thing at all, the wonder bouquet of the floral scent is still there reminding me of that special time spent with My Grandmother.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Christmas present for an elderly relative.  She is in a nursing home and unable to find this product in any store in our area. It arrived in a timely manner and Amazon is the only place I could find it.  It is the Cologne she has used for a long long time and I thought we were not going to be able to find it.  Glad amazon has hard to find products.  It makes shopping easier.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE SCENT--MUCH EASIER TO BUY WHEN NEEDED--</li>
    <li> This is an old standby perfume for me. It has that woodsy musk smell. The product arrive undamaged. It was just like buying it from the store.</li>
    <li> Awesome, item arrived promptly and in good condition. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product this year.  I prefer to buy the model (like I did last May) but the price was GREAT on this model. I expected the fragrance to be the same as all other S&amp;S purchases I&#x27;ve made over the years, but it was not the same quality of frangrance.  I&#x27;m very disappointed therefore I will not purchase this model again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good price</li>
    <li> That fresh scent you can enjoy without being overwhelmed! Smooth and delicate scent.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift &amp; she loves it!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of buying fragrances. I don&#x27;t know what women like, but I do know what smells nice. My girlfriend loved it, and I sure your someone special will too.</li>
    <li> Although the perfume is good the bottle I received is not the one pictured here. It&#x27;s more of a straight up design and I would have been more happy with the design shown at the time I purchased as I am giving it as a gift.</li>
    <li> Sand &amp; Sable&#x27;s scent is light with overtones of gardenia.  The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to change when sprayed on the skin.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. Thank You!</li>
    <li> Amazing scent!  I just love it.  It&#x27;s light and airy, not too flowery, just romantically fresh and sweet.  If I had the money, I&#x27;d order a lifetime supply.  It is my very favorite cologne. Actually, all my favorites are by Coty:  Sand &amp; Sable, Emeraude, Chantilly.  Just ordered Stetson Sierra for my husband - his favorite, which his kids had given him.  Guess what - it&#x27;s also by Coty.</li>
    <li> I question if it really is the Sand &amp; Sable scent. DeliveryOK  but question validity of product.....</li>
    <li> Glad I was able to find it.</li>
    <li> This is my every day cologne. Just enough scent but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;i always receive compliments when&lt;br /&gt;i wear it.</li>
    <li> I only hope this fragrance stays around forever, because I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and it is the only one I use!  I&#x27;m always getting compliments!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years and am completely satisfied - it is getting tougher to find, however.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. Love the light flowery smell. Arrived fast.</li>
