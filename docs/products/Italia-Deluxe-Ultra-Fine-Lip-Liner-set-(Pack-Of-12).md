      <li>nothing a good lip balm can&#x27;t fix</li>
      <li>and they even taste good...</li>
      <li>even the consistency on the MAC was drying like this one (but again nothing a good lip balm can&#x27;t fix)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are some of the best lip liners i&#x27;ve ever ordered, they are true to color and go on extremely smooth plus these colors were perfect for me, i can easily see myself wearing all 12 colors</li>
    <li> Gave this to my wife and she loves it. She immediately used once of them and it looks good on her!</li>
    <li> Loved the colors and how I got so many for the price they are creamy</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a Lip Liner, because I am not very good at that,  and at my age, not likely to get much better, but I really was in need of a lip liner. It was hard not to try these pencils at the great price and in the colors available.  The shades are almost all within the colors I use for my lipsticks.  I was happy, and having also ordered the great lipsticks on the page, I have many combinations that work together.&lt;br /&gt;I have been working to improve my applications and using them daily.  They last longer than my lipsticks usually do. And the price cannot be beat. I am more than happy with my purchase.  I don&#x27;t know how they will fair when I have to sharpen them.</li>
    <li> Omg all makeup artist need this so smooth very pigmented!!! The best lip liners... I love the colors they work well with the normal lip colors I use daily... I&#x27;m so excited about this kit addition</li>
    <li> I just ordered them.. but i want the matching lip gloss too but I can&#x27;t find them :)</li>
    <li> Love them so much, the colors are beautiful  😍😍</li>
    <li> Perfect, seriously if you want a good set of lip liners this is your go to. First, the texture of the liners is amazing its creamy and more on the matte side so it&#x27;s not shiny. They work really well with overdrawing your lips to get that Kylie Jenner look and they last through anything, sweat, food, water they will last. I highly highly suggest purchasing this product it&#x27;s a great deal and the liners are of good quality.</li>
    <li> Got this today and I tried most of them on and I can honestly say they are amazing. Just like lip liner is supposed to be. The only complaint I have with them is I got a few that were really close to the same color. But overall a very good product!</li>
    <li> very nice!  lots of shades to choose from.  goes on easy, lasts well</li>
    <li> I REALLY love these colors and you can&#x27;t beat the price either! The natural beige is now my all time favorite. I actually put it all over my lips and use it alone.</li>
    <li> I love them because they give my lips a fuller look! Like Im pouting all the time! :) I can&#x27;t contain my happiness! I finally found lip liners that are suitable for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> To my surprise, I received 4 medium length and 8 long pencils.  The pencils shown online was 12 long pencils (8.oz); but I did not receive all long pencils.  I expect to get what I pay for.</li>
    <li> perfect and great price, so in love</li>
    <li> Fantastic deal. I have only tested out a few of the colors, and can&#x27;t really report on longevity, but the liners I&#x27;ve tried are easy to apply, just the right amount of creamy, and come in a great range of shades. For the price these really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> These are nice for the price. They are smooth when ur outlining but when you&#x27;re trying to fill in ur lips they feel a bit sticky or not as smooth.</li>
    <li> I love these Lipliners 😩💕. They can easily be used as a lipstick if you wanted. There very smooth and go onto your lips easily. Theres 6 full size pencils and the other 6 are about an inch or so shorter. A little goes along way with these! I will be buying more from this brand.</li>
    <li> I like the light colors but the dark colors I toss the out</li>
    <li> Best lip liner ever love love love</li>
    <li> Love Italia products, this is my second purchase from them. I had such a good experience with the Italia eye liners that I decided to try out these lip liners and they did not disappoint. They glide on very smoothly and are very pigmented.</li>
    <li> Love them easy to apply with no irritation.</li>
    <li> This set is inexpensive, but does not wear as such. I love the plethora of colors this set offers.</li>
    <li> Good does the job but breaks easily but that was expected for this price ))) beautiful colors similar to mac pencils love it</li>
    <li> These lip liners are sooo wavy. I love all of these colors!! Honestly these lip liners to me are on the MAC level! I think they are better than NYX lip liners! They are very pigmented and easy to apply! Very Moisturizing!! Therefore they aren&#x27;t matte. They&#x27;re are a lot more of the darker colors in the package.. So if you don&#x27;t like nudes, dark nudes, reds, and plum colors.. You might not want it.. Just saying. But nevertheless, you still have a couple of pinks and a orange color! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased when they were like $9! Such a steal!!!!</li>
    <li> I got these lip liners a couple days ago and I like them so far! The only down side is that the colors are so similar, there are like 4 pencils that look like they&#x27;re the same color so I do wish there was a more variety of colors but besides that these are beautiful!</li>
    <li> Like the colors that it has.</li>
    <li> a couple came broken, those intact are very pretty and apply easily, not drying.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, which by the way changes frequently, but i got SEVEN pencils that were shorter than the other FIVE! YES, OVER HALF of my pencils were shorter! Which means no matter what you pay, you don&#x27;t get what you pay for! And these pencils have NO lasting power at all, so whatever you put on top of it better!I would have felt better getting all shorter pencils, because not I feel deliberately scammed.</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors!  Stays on pretty well and was a great price.  Shipped fast, as well.</li>
    <li> Great liners in good colors.  The price you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
    <li> Love These Pretty Cute, Usually Get This Brand &amp;&amp; The Colors Are Perfect.</li>
    <li> Nicely pigmented for the price. Great product! I&#x27;m happy with it :)</li>
    <li> This product came in on time. I love them all such beautiful colors and well worth the money</li>
    <li> This is totally worth to buy, good item.</li>
    <li> I love it.the colors are amazing.they are perfect</li>
    <li> Very creamy, nice consistency! Long-lasting, pigmented colors! I love makeup so I was a little hesitant with purchasing these pencils but with the reviews and the price, I said what the heck! Great purchase. Would totally do again!!!#boom</li>
    <li> I love them! Definitely will order again.</li>
    <li> Love them just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> These are great quality &amp; look GREAT on the lips. The staying power is amazing &amp; any lipstick applied on top of this, seriously does not budge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, is that they have quite a funk, cheap scent to them. Which kinda sucks, but isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me, because I will still continue using them!</li>
    <li> The lip liners are amazing. The colors are beautiful, and they go on perfect. The only thing is five of them came smaller than the others but other than that I would recommend them for makeup lovers. I&#x27;ve attached a photo so you could see what they look like</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!! They are very creamy lip liners, they pretty much stay on all day as a lip liner and dont need to be reapplied, but i use them as lipsticks too and if you do that they need to be applied more often but look great with clear lip gloss over the top!</li>
    <li> HIGHLY I MEAN I MEAN HIGHLY pigmented on my dark brown skin tone. Very pretty colors well worth the price</li>
    <li> Love the liner. Thr colors are so vibrant and creamy like nyx lip liners.</li>
    <li> LOVING ALL OF THESE MY FAVORITES SO FAR ARE BROWN SUGAR &amp; MAUVE! Great colors and they stay on pretty well!</li>
    <li> They work great c: highly pigmented and go on nice and smooth</li>
    <li> They arrived so quick! I was very surprised but so excited. They were in perfect condition and are very bright and vibrant.</li>
    <li> I got my package very fast. Which is amazing because I live in Hawaii and packages don&#x27;t come for about a month here. Pencils are smooth, pretty, and have a weird but satisfying smell. Only concern is that the pens are all not the same size. I promise I&#x27;m not a bot! This product is actually wonderful.</li>
    <li> Fabulous lip liners!!!! They go on super smooth and stay put quite well! I even filled in my lips all the way and wore it as a matte lipstick. Perfect!</li>
    <li> These arrived today and what a nice surprise!  12 colors for a fraction of the price!  Yes a few of the pencils are shorter than others, but no big deal.  At less than $1 per pencil, just order another pack!  Will try their eye liner next.</li>
    <li> These are good liners.  My only complaint is the smell - it&#x27;s overpowering and smells like a concentrated berry exploded in your face!</li>
    <li> i love it. it is creamy and easy to apply</li>
    <li> 5 of the pencils are shorter than the other 7. Also the letters and barcode on the short one are not clear I have the pic and I don&#x27;t have time to print and send it back get refund sorry.</li>
    <li> I like them so far...</li>
    <li> Good selection of colors and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It came on time. Amazing for its price, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> GREAT colors and they even taste good...</li>
    <li> Beautiful but the colors not the same as a picture</li>
    <li> Great Product, Great price  it can be drying but nothing a good lip balm can&#x27;t fix and I recently bought a MAC lip liner and looks the same on my lips as one of the colors in the packet (specifically I bought spice from MAC and it looked like nude from this) even the consistency on the MAC was drying like this one (but again nothing a good lip balm can&#x27;t fix) I love them both but the difference lies in that I paid $16 for just that one product. Overall, I don&#x27;t like all colors in the packet but just liking one is a win with the price and I like most so I&#x27;m extremely pleased, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I really love these liners for the price, I bought a large pack because I was fairly new to using lip liners and wanted a variety of colors. There are a few that say they are different colors but go on the same as others close to it. However, they go on smooth you will not tear your lips off applying. Good for the price and some variation of color. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> The lip liners are very smooth and have good pigmentation. Value for money.</li>
    <li> these pencils came right on time the quality is great, none of the pencils were broken and they&#x27;re more than i could have hoped for.</li>
    <li> A variety of colors and good coverage.  Stays on pretty well throughout the day.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! they feel so good, not to dry, easy to apply!</li>
    <li> Love these lip liners. Bought these along with the princessa 12 pack and the colors match up perfectly!</li>
    <li> I never give reviews but this time I am so so happy with my lip liners that I had to give a review !! .... I love my products they are just amazing I love all the colors . They arrived sooner than I thought ,  Money well spend ! :) :) :)</li>
    <li> Love it, very creamy vibrant colors, not as big as some say they are, but still a very decent size like a regula #2 pencil size, excellent price, fast delivery!!!</li>
    <li> Wow! Great set of lip liners. Great value! There is a color for every shade of lipstick. They go on smooth and sharpen easily. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great product beautiful colors creamy texture amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Very pigmented and creamy. I am very happy i ordered these !</li>
    <li> Mine just came in the mail today on time. They are great. Very fine and pigmented....&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is I got a lot of dark colors and I mainly wanted the spice and neutral that I had seen on the customer photos.....</li>
    <li> Very creamy and super pigmented. Effortless application. I wish there was a bit more variety since most of them are in shades of brown but great value for the price! Used nude and hot cocoa in the picture and loved the results!</li>
    <li> Really smooth, high quality,great pigmentation Lon lasting!</li>
    <li> Beautiful set! Can&#x27;t wait to try em!</li>
    <li> In love 😍😘 they are all so pretty one of them I got 2 of the same color but I gave it to my sis ☺️ thank u so so much 😌</li>
    <li> Lemmie tell u. In my opinion these goes on better than my mac lip liners!!! Yes I said it. And also my nyx. These pencils r like butter. And they r very pigmented for the price!!!!!!!! I am surprise because there is not alotta rave about these pencils. I see other customers complaining that some r longer than some n they don&#x27;t last the whole day. Like which lipstick does???? No matter how expensive ur lip liners r they ain&#x27;t gonna last the whole day. Unless u don&#x27;t eat or something. N they r lip liners ppl, (not really ideal for wearing on its own last very long) for 10 dollars???? Come on yawl. I say this does it&#x27;s job n beyond. That&#x27;s all matters to me.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and I use it as lipstick most days. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> These lip liners are very creamy and the color pay off is good. They are definitely worth the price. I use these the same way I use my MAC liners.....for everything...lol! The packaging and shipping was also good. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Just received the set. Longer than the other sets I purchased. The pigmentation is great with a soft and smooth application. The variety of browns is good for me as I wear a lot of natural, nude lipsticks.  Love the Hot Red, Cabaret and Burgundy. I will purchase other sets from Italia.</li>
    <li> What a great deal for so many liners!! I have my favorites. I got all different colors ranging from brown nudes pinks and plum oh and one that could be paired with coral lipstick. A beautiful red as well!! These were a creamy consistency. They glide on your lips. No dragging or pulling. Yes you have to sharpen them but well worth it. These are extremely long pencils too!! I really love that I can experiment now with different color lipsticks. I got stuck in a nude color lipstick rut for a while. Now I can expand my horizons! These are wonderful pencils. I do love the nude same color as my lip the two pinks one a dusty rose also the color of my lip and hot pink which is a Barbie pink And a light nude brown which also just pops a little color on my lips. I am extremely pleased with the quality of these pencils. I have bought inexpensive lip liners and they tug across your lip ouch!! Not these!! I suggest if you want less touch ups a primer and a light dusting of your concealer powder on top then redraw the line. Works every time!!</li>
    <li> These liners are very vibrant and are so creamy I have it applied perfectly in seconds. One review I saw said that they don&#x27;t work on the full lip, but in my experience they can...very well. They also blend well so I can use them with either each other or a lip stick to create the perfect colour for the day. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very good, thick and dark so go light on it, but it is really nice.</li>
    <li> Omg I freaking love these lip liners they are so cute</li>
    <li> Very pigmented ! I Absolutely recommend this if you love lining your lips!!! Just as nice as any Mac or Sephora liner !</li>
    <li> Some colors are very strange...but I can find my perfect nude!</li>
    <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but after receiving this product, I just had to! I mean the pencils were creamy, so easy to apply and th colours were just perfect for my caramel skin tone (but they would suit any tone). They were so lovey, that family members took them from me! Will be ordering some more of these. Only issue is I&#x27;m from the UK and is in the US for bit, so I can&#x27;t recommend to my family and friends in the UK. Thank you to the sellers and manufacturers.</li>
    <li> I am not generally a makeup person, so keep that in mind as you read. Given my abysmal skills applying makeup, I bought these just to play around with...and expected pretty bad results as I have not had much good experience with liners.  Considering that these are less than a dollar a piece I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  These were very easy to use, and have a nice smooth application. Which surprised me as they are pencil---even when they are getting on the need to sharpen side they still are smooth.&lt;br /&gt;  The colors are great, and there is a good range with this set.  Yes some of the colors appear similar but I found when I apply them they have different undertones and look quite different when applied--especially when mixed with various colors of lipstick.  The only negative is that they are not long lasting, and reapplication happens.  But again given the low cost, this really is not a big deal.  Great bang for you buck!</li>
    <li> Excellent value! colors are great and give a great variety! I bought this to really launch my collection and i am very pleased with how easy they are to use. These will last me a very long time!</li>
    <li> The Toast color is a great dupe for KVD Lolita, matte, stays in place well, all the other colors are great too. So cheap I&#x27;m in shock and have formed a lip liner addiction as a result.</li>
    <li> although smooth to apply, the product is very dry once on</li>
    <li> I love all of them. I think some are matte...</li>
    <li> These lip liner pencils are exceptional! They glide on smooth and are pigment intense. The range of colors you get is very good. All in all these lip liner pencils are much better than most expensive name brands. What an amazing price for such quality!!!</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love these lip pencils. The variety of color is great, and these pencils glide on smooth.</li>
    <li> I honestly think these lip liners are amazing, they&#x27;re creamy and as soon as you put it on it drys and it stays for a long amount of time, doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re drinking or eating something, it will stay. Mine usually lasts all day long, I really recommend you to try them ❤</li>
    <li> awesome product. goes on smooth and the colors are bright. wipes off easy if you try, but stays on long if you leave it alone.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good product</li>
    <li> Well I was disappointed because I really was looking forward for the deep purple but it didn&#x27;t come with the pack also they were not all the same length which is weird. Other then that  I&#x27;m really happy with the product. Goes on smooth and the colors are beautiful.</li>
    <li> Not too much variety, but good for matching up different shades. It also applies very easily, and stays on well.</li>
    <li> Love them!!! They go on so smooth and stay on!</li>
    <li> LOVE the colors, they are gorgeous! If you eat/drink with these on you will have to reapply.</li>
    <li> So soft and good colors.</li>
    <li> I use these lip liners as lipstick most of the time!  (Easy to carry in my purse and take up little or no room!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have a nice creaminess to them which is much different than other lip liners I&#x27;ve bought. A few are a bit dryer, but I can still blend them without a problem.  And they don&#x27;t come off as easily as most lip sticks do.  All of the pencils are the size of a standard lead pencil and don&#x27;t shatter when sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The colors are rich, with a nice range,  and can be as bright as you&#x27;d like or very subtle - your choice. They also blend with each other nicely- I try to keep a matte look, so I use my finger to do the blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My only quibble is that some of the darker shades are nearly identical.  It would be nice if there had been a few more pinks/fuchsias instead of half of the pencils being dark,  but that is a minor matter I can work around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these are a versatile product and a fine addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup kit.</li>
    <li> Good nice worth the price and different nice colors</li>
    <li> Super soft and nice colors</li>
    <li> Excellent quality liners. Nice color assortment. Application was smooth and they also have a pleasant scent. Wore over entire lip and applied Bobbi Brown lip balm for a natural looking sheen. Looked nice and remained on the lip a good while.</li>
    <li> got this product in 2 days, and I swatched all of the colors right away. they have amazing pigmentation,and there creamy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;just use it on your entire lip, add a little bit of clear gloss and it looks outstanding.</li>
    <li> Loveeeeeeeeee these lip liners.  Not harsh on your lips and the colors are very rich.</li>
    <li> In all honesty, you get what you paid for. These are amazing for their price however the are overly hyped. Got my package sooner than expected and yes they go on nicely and are super pigmented. Only downfall is that they look extremely cheap when you apply all over to your lips. Definitely recommend only for lining your lips rather than fully shading them in.</li>
    <li> I did not realize that I would not get the same colors as the ones in the first picture of the description.I don&#x27;t think I would buy this product if I knew I was going to get the colors that I did, apparently you get a random selection of 12 from the 21 between 1021 and 1051. Was really looking forward to plum, dusty rose, and deep purple, but got none of them. Also, only two were the long length and the rest were about half an inch shorter.</li>
    <li> Omg!!! These are amazing!! Very pigmented... I use them alone on my lips and they stay on very long</li>
    <li> I love these liners and I would definitely buy them again...they are perfect if you want a matte look. The are not typically dry they went on smooth and moist was happy about that and if you want you could make custom colors, mixing different colors to achieve a particular shade was great!!!</li>
    <li> Loveeee it there soon worth it</li>
    <li> I really love this! &amp; for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s pretty long lasting in my opinion, except it might wear off a little when eating. But overall you really can&#x27;t go wrong. Very pigmented, easy to apply, and the colors are all beautiful</li>
    <li> Love My New Pencils! So glad I bought them,&lt;br /&gt;They go on smooth, and stay on. Great Price!</li>
    <li> I like the variety of colors provided in this set. I generally wear one of the red shades under red lipstick, but I&#x27;ve also worn the other colors alone with just a bit of gloss. If you&#x27;re trying to figure out what shades of lipsticks look best on you, or just want to play around with colors you wouldn&#x27;t normally wear, I think this is an excellent purchase. There are a couple of very dark burgandy or purplish shades that I would never buy in a tube, but I actually liked the way they looked for a more extreme look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a nice fine tip, and are easy to apply. Each liner is a full size (approximately the size of a regular pencil), so you can get a lot of use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last pretty long, depending on your eating and drinking habits. If I wear the liner alone over lip balm, it generally lasts through coffee, a snack, and a bottle of water, but is generally gone by lunch. With the liner and lipstick (Besame brand), I usually still have color on my lips after lunch, though it&#x27;s faded a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this set is a good buy if you&#x27;re looking to experiment with a lot of different lipstick colors.</li>
    <li> If there were more light colors I would have rated these at 5 stars but even so, these are a great value.&lt;br /&gt;They are soft and go on easily, lasting a long time.&lt;br /&gt;They sharpen well, and I&#x27;ve not had any issues with breaking pencil tips.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very saturated,  and give consistent application.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t detect any scent, have had no problems with irritation of any sort...they seem to be very high quality, especially for this amazingly low price!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore these! They are honestly comparable to Mac liners. They go on super smith and are matte without drying out your lips. I love that the seller didn&#x27;t compromise quality for quantity. Only thing that bothers me is that the Browns look more burgundy on my skin but that&#x27;s not a big deal. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are highly pigmented, long lasting, large sized lip liners for a terrific price! I am obsessed with the variety of colors in this 12 piece set :) They vary from dark browns, deep purples, bright reds, matte nudes, to hot pinks! I&#x27;ve included pictures to show how pigmented these colors are. As a makeup lover, I have a multitude of lip sticks, glosses, and stains and it can be expensive to buy individual lip liners to match all the colors. This set achieves that for the price of 2 drugstore lip liners! These are also full size pencils! Longer than typical liners. The tips are fine but are easily buildable for thicker lines. The quality of the color is excellent, very creamy and easy to apply and sharpen. These last about as long as my lipsticks do and I didn&#x27;t notice any irratation or breakouts after wearing. Their main ingredients are listed as: carnauba wax, bees wax, ceresin, cocoa and shea butters, octyldodecanol, isopropyl myristate, diethylhexylcyclohexane, butylparaben, and BHT. These are listed as &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am extremely pleased with the quality and feel of the pigments, the variety of colors, and the size of the pencils. A must have for makeup lovers!</li>
    <li> Pros: nice colors, very pigmented, goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: has a funny smell, some of the pencils are longer than others</li>
    <li> These are perfect. They feel like they could be high brand (compared to what I&#x27;ve used before. Ex. NYX). Love them</li>
    <li> These bad girls are amazing!. Super creamy, smooth, easy to apply and they last long. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love these pencils  quality is great and lazts all day. Arrived a day earlier and I couldnt be happier</li>
    <li> Great color and Good  quality</li>
    <li> Safe to say that if you want these, buy them. They definitely get the job done, they glide on perfectly! And they smell pretty good. Why 2 stars? Because the colors I got were repeated. Your not going to get every single color in the picture, and your definitely going to get two of the same. They should give the option of the colors, so we as buyers, can select the color we want. Besides... who knows better of what we want for each individual shade? Right ladies? But seriously I LOVE THESE THINGS!!!!</li>
    <li> These are so awesome! The pencils are so creamy that they glide right on. The colors are strong and vibrant, and I&#x27;m pretty sure the pencils themselves will last a long time. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous they go on smoothly a must have definitely</li>
    <li> Two colors 1 inch smaller than then the other which are 6 3/4  (roughly). Two I got were an inch smaller and the colored bottom that denotes the color of the pencil is half the size as the other 10 :( Worse of the are two of the colors I use most Natural (1033) and Hot Red (1047). No option to just swap me the right liners. But the product is good. But I feel like I didn&#x27;t get what I paid for.</li>
    <li> This is a great value! I use the liners as a lip stick most days. My favorite colors are the nude natural and mauve. They compliment any lipstick close to their shade</li>
    <li> I LOVE these liners, the colors are awesome and honestly last the whole day or night. They arrived SO quick. The box came in perfect condition as well as each pencil. Can&#x27;t beat this price either, it now looks like I have a massive collection of lip-liners after once small purchase! So affordable! Will definitely order from this seller again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Lovely colors but the do not last.</li>
    <li> I love these. I&#x27;ve used them every day since I got them. Great selection of colors for the price.</li>
    <li> Product sticky...applying lip gloss or lip oniment helps eliminate the sticky like residue</li>
    <li> The colors are very pigmented, I don&#x27;t have to press really hard to get the liners to show up... These are great quality! I would definitely purchase again .</li>
    <li> Love all of the pencils that came in the order! They are really nice colors, and easy to apply and blend. So glad I ordered these!</li>
    <li> The color scheme here is great.  You get a color for every occasion.  Glides on smooth but wipes off easily so make sure you wear your base lip conditioner.  I recommend!</li>
    <li> It came just in time, but some of the pencils were shorter then the overs which was very disappointing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  The quality was so good I&#x27;m placing additional orders for gifts.</li>
    <li> Love them , very pigmented, last the whole day. Very impressed. Will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality, some colors were reapeted but that is ok with me. I love them and get so many compliments on the colors. They are very lasting. I washed my hand with soap and rubbed the swatches and it barely came off, the third picture shows that.</li>
    <li> Great colors, most stay on for hours but the darker colors smudge very easily. I have dark brick red lips and the light pinks cover them right up! Will buy again at this amazing price!</li>
    <li> I love the color range the liner come it, very versatile.</li>
    <li> As someone with extremely sensitive skin I am ecstatic with these lipliners. I find that they are independently suitable as lipstick...matte without the dryness found in most matte lipsticks</li>
    <li> You get more than you pay for. Lots of pretty shades, really nice selection for the price. Would love to see a rosey natural pink, but for the price, totally worth it!</li>
    <li> So in love with these eyeliners. I am just building my makeup set, experimenting with colors, so i didnt want anything too expensive. These work well, they stay in place, are easy to apply and very pigmented.</li>
    <li> I actually quite like the pencils. They are very beautiful an glide on easy. My issue lies with the time it took to receive. It got delayed 2 and I was supposed to receive on the 20th at the latest an did not actually receive until the 23.</li>
    <li> These are nice pink to brown colors.  They go on really smoothly and feel nice on my lips.  They don&#x27;t have any noticeable scent (though my sniffer isn&#x27;t the greatest). I have no other lip pencils to compare these to but I would buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, I&#x27;m a guy... and a chimp when it come to lipstick... but I love it none the less.  These make it so I don&#x27;t look like a 3 year old who broke into his mom&#x27;s makeup box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought them with Prime, they were on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money for this product. I have all the colors I need at a low price. Great quality too :)</li>
    <li> Love all the colors. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I really like them so much! Use lip liners on my brides.</li>
    <li> These are great, so pigmented, great colors, lovely variety, soft, love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the variety of colors!! Highly recommended! Colors are very pigmented although some of the colors look very similar to each other it will do. Also, they came in different sizes? Some are shorter than others... I was very confused. I gave it a 4 star because shipping took VERY long. Delivery date changed twice and I was also charged twice. Still in the process of getting my money back.</li>
    <li> If you are reading this review, it is because you want to determine if this product is worth your money or time.Let me save you the mental energy- IT IS!! Compared to any other lip liner out there (including mac), this product stands out and stands tall. It applies smoothly and has a rich color, and yes, you can apply it to your entire lip in the place of lipstick</li>
    <li> Just got home and checked the mail. I love them. They&#x27;re very pigmented and are great colors</li>
    <li> Awesome lip liners! They came in about 4 days so shipping was fast. They are soft and easy to use! I got two fuchsias but all the rest were different colors and really the price was fantastic so two of the same color is not a big deal. Mine came with a good true red, some darks, a nude, light pink, hot pink, a purplish one so the variation is good and they will work with a lot of my lipsticks. I own over 40 lipsticks so finding lip liners for so cheap and in different colors was a steal! A wonderful purchase!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are just fine! No need for pricey ones.</li>
    <li> This is a good variety for the price, however, no one needs this much variety.  Generally speaking, your makeup colors are pretty defined based on your skin tone so it would be nice to see a 12 pack of lip liners for specific skin tones instead of one that has colors for all skin tones.  If I could find one that had 12 shades of pink it would be perfect.  There seem to be more dark colors in this set than I expected.  However, the liners themselves go on smooth and work well.  I did find that they had to be reapplied even when I used setting powder over tissue to set the color.</li>
    <li> These are actually pretty nice. Good color. Goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Smell is not bad, but not good. Other than that, these are creamy lip pencils that are easy to apply. Can&#x27;t ask for a better bargain.</li>
    <li> I love these! Beautiful colors, great price, fast shipping. I was nervous bc the price was so cheap but they&#x27;re great. The reviews are true.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied and I received it on time..</li>
    <li> LOVE!!!! very pigmented and easy to apply. Plus the colors are super nice and goes with every makeup look</li>
    <li> First off the colors are great! It goes on super smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave the crappy left over stuff that cheap liner does.. My fave Amazon purchase so far!</li>
    <li> Love them so many and soft application! Good buy</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with these. They are very good quality with desirable colors. One application will last several hours.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! Great colors and they came quickly. There was no damage or melting. It&#x27;s exactly what you expect it to be. Im extremely happy with this order.  They go on very nicely. They seem to be matte so if you fill in all of your lips with it like I do sometimes, I recommend a gloss on top or some lip balm.</li>
    <li> very good pencils for the price. color goes on smooth and lasts for a very long time. Im glad i went with this choice. shouldve had a purple in the mix.</li>
    <li> wonderful and a great price highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The pencils are long, very soft but matte , they dont dry out your lips they dont drag they dont break easily , they are rick in color and long lasting , i like to wear them all over my lips (a little goes along way!) Very blendable! Sugar brown is what i usually wear (as in photo) its my absolute favorite, i WILL buy again as sokn as i use up all these which clearly will take foreverr ;) im super happy with this purchase !</li>
    <li> Super creamy and great pigmentation!!! HIGH quality</li>
    <li> Great product great price. I usually only buy Mac products but for this price it&#x27;s a great way to go through colors that are the best on you without spending a small fortune!</li>
    <li> Seriously the best money spent on lip liners! This set is beautiful on and i only need to apply once for all day wear. Colors are beautiful. I will be purchasing more! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love these. . They will stay on for hours..</li>
    <li> Love them! Great price for the size and definitely the quality of them. The stay on for a decent amount of time nd goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Very nice, rich and smooth colors. I like to apply to my entire lips and go over with a lip gloss. Lasts for about 3-4 hours.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Color payoff was great as well :)</li>
    <li> These are a real bargain.  The colors are many, all useful, and I only needed to apply once and the color lasted all day and into the evening.  The consistency is not too moist and not too dry.  The colors are vivid and true to the paint at the end of each pencil.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this set!</li>
    <li> The colors are great as well as the consistency. As someone who regularly uses lip liner, consistency is a key factor when buying liner. Some of the pencils are shorter than the others as you can see in my picture, but these are great for the price and I&#x27;m going to buy these again. Heck, I&#x27;m going to place the order right now.</li>
    <li> Super Impressed!! Great Value!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pencils are super creamy and rich in color. They glide right onto your lips with any tucking. For the price you cant beat the value. The variety of color are ok. You get red, browns, pinks, and a nude. The only thing I wish it had was a coral color but still not disappointed. Great for the deep dark matte look that is on trend now. Love them!! No regrets!!!</li>
    <li> Great colors and application is smooth and buttery feel. Nice mat finish.</li>
    <li> Wow - goes on so smooth - Highly recommend this liner - STEADY HANDS and light pressure</li>
    <li> I have not tried all of he lip pencils yet and some of the colors are too bright for my preference, and I have sort of a caramel complexion so the natural and natural beige colors do not look right. Overall I like the product. Would recommend if you have a variety of lip colors or if you want to start building your lipstick colors.</li>
    <li> These came in pretty quickly, I just received them. However, 7 of the pencils are shorter than the other 5. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Definetly worth the money! Creamy and great color pay off! They are long too and great shades! A lot of dupes for well known brands</li>
    <li> I liked it so much, I bought it for someone else.</li>
    <li> I expected a wider array of colors. Theres a lot of brown shades and not enough pinks and purples</li>
    <li> I love these lip pencils! A friend of mine was wearing one alone as a lipstick so I asked her what brand. She told me they were italia deluxe. I had never heard or seen them before so I ordered some. They really are the best lip pencil ever! They don&#x27;t dry out my lips which is some feat with my always dehydrated flaky lips. The color last forever even through eating and once gone leaves a stain. They have no smell and have a smooth texture when applying. Also these are much longer than other pencils. What&#x27;s not to love when these are so cheap too! This is the second time I have purchased these once from eBay and now from amazon. I lost the color burgundy included in this set so I ordered this so I could have it again and extras. This set has all of my favorite colors too!&lt;br /&gt;I use these as all over lip color since lipstick fades too quickly on my lips. I&#x27;ve never tried it with lipstick on top because they work so well by themselves. I have tried it with a lip oil with no color and lip balms and they work just fine for some extra shine.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me you can&#x27;t get a better lip pencil.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE these. Soft and creamy in the lips. Definitely will keep repurchasing. Keep these babies around!!!!</li>
    <li> Really impressed very creamy and pigmented would say comparable to nyx and Mac liners such a good price!</li>
