      <li>She loves it because it doesn&#x27;t have any odor of its own and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue to clog pores or get onto clothes.  </li>
      <li>pouch is also nice.</li>

      <li>The pouch was a nice touch and it has a container so it keeps clean in the bathroom, but this product didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a very important</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very important to remember to follow the instructions that come with it though.</li>
      <li>so I cant complain I would buy another one for sure.</li>
      <li>I do love this stuff though</li>
      <li>They all love (</li>
      <li>and I know my sister and others will love it as well...</li>
      <li>I love this stuff though, converted my mom, brother, an my boyfriend to using this stuff (</li>
      <li>Thai stones rock...  :-)</li>
      <li>to why I left a four star instead of a five: It stops odor, but it did not stop wetness as it purports to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a great product though!</li>
      <li>I bought this to try after having many of my shirts stained and ruined.</li>
      <li>That takes care of moisture better than the stone by itself.</li>
      <li>Okay, so...I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Despite trying so many brands, our odor issues were not under control.  </li>
      <li>:)    </li>
      <li>This is definatly better.</li>
      <li>I have since ordered two more to give out as gifts because it works so well.    </li>
      <li>Sure you will sweat and after a day doing yard work</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s most favorable outcome is no odor.  </li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>: be sure that you wash the area before applying... from what I&#x27;ve noticed</li>
      <li>Works better than</li>
      <li>I love this so much better than the stone in a plastic holder.</li>
      <li>and I found myself having to reapply a lot more often.</li>
      <li>Of course aluminum-based deodorant looks better, handles better, and for many people works better.</li>
      <li>You have to cover a much greater area with this than with deoderant.  </li>
      <li>, she smells fantastic!    </li>
      <li>and they love it.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
      <li>the best part is-I won&#x27;t need to buy any for a long while :).I</li>
      <li>It really worked for us, amazing!  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s great not having shirts ruined, and this will save hundreds of dollars when compared to buying a new antiperspirant stick every couple of weeks for a year.</li>
      <li>cool!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to order from Amazon</li>
      <li>And so easy to use....</li>
      <li>Just that easy.</li>
      <li>/enjoy with strongly perfumed underarm products.</li>
      <li>But once you get it figured out it works fine.</li>
      <li>I still smell fine</li>
      <li>I keep a small spray can of Axe in my truck for especially warm days if things get out of hand, but for the most part, this thing works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In all the  appointments and out patient surgeries not one nurse or doctor ever shed light on this deodarant alternative to me.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, the stone was wrapped in plastic.</li>
      <li>I am smell free.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worked out at the gym and sat in the sauna for 20+ minutes and the armpits are smell free.  </li>
      <li>I genuinely stopped using anti-persistent and deodorant to try this for a week.</li>
      <li>This product is natural, safe, inexpensive, and highly effective.</li>
      <li>(no more) everyone is very happy.</li>
      <li>Which in a way is good if you have sweaty palms O_o    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now, and so far I am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Another great note is it lasts so long!</li>
      <li>Everyone said \\&quot;You smell fine.\\&quot; and \\&quot;You smell like clean laundry.\\&quot; (which is just the smell of my shirts, not of the product)    </li>

      <li>I love it so much I am getting my sister, niece, and neighbor a bar...</li>
      <li>and they are still usable as a deodorant just not as enjoyable as using the whole thing</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works really well, pretty much as good as I had expected from what I had read previously to purchasing. The only problem I have had with it was I had to get it wet under the faucet to use it so it was slippery and has slipped right out of my hands a few times. One of which it fell in the bathtub and shattered, I was pretty bummed but the upside to that is I still have all the pieces it broke into and they are still usable as a deodorant just not as enjoyable as using the whole thing but it still works so I cant complain I would buy another one for sure.</li>
    <li> My family has struggled with controling body odor issues for as long as I can remember.  We have tried every option available in the regular stores from sticks, to roll ons, to sprays.  Despite trying so many brands, our odor issues were not under control.  My own irritation levels under my arms (redness, raised bumps, discomfort) became so high over the last year, I was desperate.  I did some research and learned the aluminum content in the sprays may be the culprit.  I stumbled onto the Thai stone product and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed a little odd to me a first but oh, did it work!  It&#x27;s most favorable outcome is no odor.  Note, it does not stop perspiration, I do sweat.  I do not do heavy workouts or have a job that causes me to sweat, so the little bit of sweating I do is not an issue (I notice no stains on my shirts).  And my irritation under my arms is gone; my skin looks normal now.  My son, who does heavy lifting at his job, comes home soaked through.  He perspires heavily on any deodorant but with the stone, no odor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice on how to best use the stone: make sure your underarms are clean/dry.  Wet the one side of the stone -- do not immerse the whole stone in water, just a dash of water to wet it.  Rub it over the entire area covering all the pores several times (I would say 5 to 6 times up and down).  If you make it a little too wet, just have a small towel ready to dab just below your pores to take off any excess water drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stone has worked wonders for me from a health perspective.  My husband and kids (who always seem to be in a hurry when they are getting ready to go to work/school) prefer the mist pump. Yes, it is a quicker process no doubt, but have a towel at the ready.  There will definitely be excess salt water running down below your underarms.</li>
    <li> I have been using deodorant stones for 30 years instead of sprays, sticks or roll-ons. They really work. They also never really wear out and the only way you need a new one is if you drop it and it breaks - over and over. My last one was around for 8 - 10 years and it was not nearly as big as this. Did I say it really works? It closes your pores to keep you from sweating. This stone will also stop bleeding from razor cuts or anything else. Just wet it before applying.</li>
    <li> This product just doesn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s been a couple days and I try to apply as much of it but I start to sweat and smell within a couple hours.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these on a lark. I actually heard someone laughing about how hippies use a crystal instead of deodorant, and I&#x27;m of the school of thought: \\&quot;Don&#x27;t knock it till you try it,\\&quot; so I did, and I was shocked that it works. Two caveats: one, if you miss a spot on your underarm with AXE or whatever the kids are wearing these days, you get some margin for error, not with this thing. You&#x27;ve got to carefully hit all of the zones that stink originates from. Two, your body has a natural smell that it makes which you don&#x27;t get to smell/enjoy with strongly perfumed underarm products. Because that smell only cropped up in the years before using this salt when I was really sweating at a level that the deodorant or antiperspirant couldn&#x27;t keep up, I had to remember to remind myself that when I smelled that it wasn&#x27;t BO, it was just my own scent.    When I bought this, I really thought I had tossed my money away on something ridiculous. Turns out I like it.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased one of these stones about 5 years ago and has used it ever since.  She is just to the point now of thinking about getting a new one because her original is getting a little small to handle. She loves it because it doesn&#x27;t have any odor of its own and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue to clog pores or get onto clothes.  Why would anyone spend and spend and spend money on regular commercial deodorants when a product like this is available?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had infections under my arms for over 25 years.  In all the  appointments and out patient surgeries not one nurse or doctor ever shed light on this deodarant alternative to me.  A friend of my Mother mentioned this product a few years ago, and my Mother passed the knowledge onto me.  I at the time didn&#x27;t believe this type of product actually existed.  Now a few years later and growing more and more desperate to fix my problem, I decided to give this deodoant a try.    Well, I&#x27;m glad I did.  I think it&#x27;s working.  I have no more rashes and only minor itches from the infections I have left.  Hopefully, in time, the infections will go away.  I think they will because it is quite evident that I&#x27;m not rubbing any chemicals and such on them.    And OH....For those of you worried that your B.O. won&#x27;t go away with it.  Take stalk in this \\&quot;My horrible odor is GONE\\&quot;.  And this deodorant truly does not stain.  I recommend this product to everone!    Thankyou thankyou thankyou Thai Deodorant Stone!</li>
    <li> So I am woman who has had to use men&#x27;s deodorant for a while because the women&#x27;s deodorants would work well at first but then the scents would react with my sweat (and the pheromones therein) and would produce this really weird musky scent.  So, the only thing that has worked for me is men&#x27;s degree.  however, I don&#x27;t like the idea of absorbing metal into my skin &amp; the natural deodorants simply don&#x27;t work, in my case.    So, I ordered one of these and WOW!  No reaction with my pheromones at all and I&#x27;m staying dryyyyyyy and my underarms smell the same as the rest of my skin.  It&#x27;s amazing- buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.  Tip: be sure that you wash the area before applying... from what I&#x27;ve noticed, whatever scent you have before you apply it, that stays.    Thai stones rock...  :-)</li>
    <li> SO at first I was unsure and read through all the reviews and decided to give it a try. I purchased it about 8 months ago and I am still happily using it. Standard deodorants, even the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones, would make my arm pits feel a burning sensation and of course the residue and the yellow stains on my white shirts just got overly annoying. BUT this deodorant stone has given me NO side-effects while still performing like an all day deodorant! I also love that after applying it (which I apply after my shower during my drying process, and all I do is run water over the stone and rub it under my arms and rinse off the stone and let it dry) and it dries, it looks like I have nothing on under my arms! So I am proud now to bust out the sleeveless tops! Also, I work 12hr shifts and never have I found myself saying my deodorant failed. Bottom line, this product is so worth a try and has lasted me over 8 months and still looks like it has another 1-2 years at least to its life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for the last 15 or so years.  I usually get them from Pangea ([...]).  They work great and last a long time if you don&#x27;t drop them on the bathroom floor ;)</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve had problems with deodorant stains on my clothes.  I ran across this product and thought I would give it a shot.  It works perfectly.  You get it wet and rub it under your arms.  You can also rub it on your feet if you are the smelly foot type.  After an entire day of working, then working out, then riding my bike I am smell free.  No stains on clothes at all.  I was skeptical at first, but now I&#x27;m a lifetime user.</li>
    <li> My husband loves and swears by this item.  It has taken about 12 years to finally have to order another one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works!I even smelled my clothes to see if I could trace that musty smell that forms when you&#x27;re not wearing deodorant , or residue, or even the scent of sweet-smelling sticky deodorant mixed with that MUSTY smell-but I found nothing!This stuff is great, and it doesn&#x27;t feel weird at all ; it&#x27;s not sticky, not full of the chemicals of traditional deodorants, and it&#x27;s so easy to use.My only complaint is that the stand that comes with it broke in half, other than that I will definitely be buying this again!But the best part is-I won&#x27;t need to buy any for a long while :).I use it once a day, and don&#x27;t need to carry it around so it won&#x27;t crumble like those other awful ones.365+ uses for 8 bucks?You have to give it a try!</li>
    <li> This crystal is amazing! It really does work as an anti-deodorant. I&#x27;ve been trying to find an all natural product that eliminates odors completely. Tom&#x27;s Natural Deodorant never worked for me but this leaves me smelling BO-free even after a hard run.</li>
    <li> I have been using professional strength deodorant, not because i perspire but because of odor. I didn&#x27;t like it because it was so hard to wash off. This is definatly better. Still need to see cost wise how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this but I was having problems finding a deodorant that worked for me so I figured I had nothing to lose.  This really, really works.  It&#x27;s amazing.  It leaves no residue, no marks on my clothing, and nothing to gunk up my razor when I shave.  I&#x27;m buying more of these for my friends and family, and myself!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product! I first bought mine in Spring of 2008, and I still have have some years left. It works great, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about polluting my body with unnecessary chemicals just to smell fresh.</li>
    <li> Used this product for a month now and its great! I would place this on the \\&quot;highly recommended\\&quot; list for alternative deodorant control. Don&#x27;t need to worry about any aluminum poisoning and/or other unknown chemical we place into our bodies on a daily bases. Definitely works as described. I&#x27;ll be using this from now on!</li>
    <li> this product is so amazing.  i have not had to buy deodorant since last year.  last forever and really, really works.  Had 3 friends buy and they love it.  I friend has a daughter whos feet smelled. (no more) everyone is very happy.</li>
    <li> This stone Thai deodorant is an excellent product, the best I&#x27;ve never used. I recommend to try this product, the cost is lower in relation with the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this crystal deodorant stone based on the rave reviews.  My husband and I tried it out, laughing at ourselves for rubbing a wet wad of ... something (I don&#x27;t really know what it is) into our armpits.  I put it through a 2-hour walk, sitting around in my sweaty walking clothes for awhile afterward, then sleeping overnight (I would normally shower, I just wanted to test the crystal wad&#x27;s \\&quot;powers\\&quot; on this occasion).  Nothing.  Not even a hint of a stink.  Same for my husband.    I&#x27;ve been using it every day for almost a week now and it&#x27;s just the same.  No matter what I&#x27;m doing or for how long, there is no sign of body odor! We&#x27;ll be buying another to use on our feet.  It is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made!</li>
    <li> It took me a long time before I found a deodorant that was right for me.  When I was little, I remember my mom using a deodorant stone and I thought that was silly.  Well, a few months ago, my sister also had one.  I knew it was my time to try it.  It works like a miracle!  Who knew that rubbing a \\&quot;rock\\&quot; on your armpits could make them never smell!</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised. I am amazed at its effectiveness. There is no residue and no odor. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many other alternatives to regular deodorant, that were supposed to work.  And of course they didn&#x27;t.  So I had low expectations when ordering this product.  Well it is amazing.  It works, it works, it works!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she really likes it.  The stone is heavy, I think about 8 ounces or so.  We later purchased more crystal stone deodorants for the rest of the family.  It really worked for us, amazing!  I&#x27;d buy these stones again through this company and Amazon...shipping time wasn&#x27;t too bad either!</li>
    <li> My husband likes the salt deodorants.  He says he still sweats, but he doesn&#x27;t stink.  I notice just as much odor on myself.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought rubbing a wet rock on your underarms would control BO? I was skeptical, but bought one anyway. I have since ordered two more to give out as gifts because it works so well.    These look like white stones and are very hard. You wet them under the faucet and then rub under your arms. I still can&#x27;t detect any oder the next morning before going into the shower, they work that good.    Be aware though, these control odor, they do nothing to control perspiration. I just brush a bit of gold bond talcum powder under there to handle that.</li>
    <li> This is a review for a Thai product but I&#x27;m going to quote a Chinese proverb I know - from the coffers of my limited stutters in Mandarin: sheng zhou ye - meaning disaster in one&#x27;s armpit, literally. I shall not disclose why I know this phrase but it suffices that I can tell you how to avert one - without chemicals. This stone comes from the gods of hygiene - it must, for it works like magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after shower on wet skin or after toweling and moisturizing. It comes with a flimsy plastic sea-shell-lookalike dish, but maybe you can find the perfect perch for this sorcerer&#x27;s stone at bathoutlet where we got ours. Not sure if Amazon allows external links, but here it is: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe everything I said here, but do trust me when I say this works. Reapplication might be required for the unabashed who sweat with abandon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve pulled the little red pouch out of my overnight bag and sung its praises to whoever would listen.  The reason I&#x27;ve only given it four stars is that my stone has not held up like others have said theirs did.  I&#x27;ve had the stone for about 6 months now and I use it daily, sometimes twice if it&#x27;s really hot out.  I&#x27;ve since read online that Potassium alum is HIGHLY soluble in hot water.. I can only imagine that running this under hot water in the shower has been the cause of my stone&#x27;s &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34;.  The down side is that it now has sharp edges around the center that can be painful if rubbed the wrong way.  I&#x27;ll probably end up keeping this one for travel and just buying a new one for the house.</li>
    <li> This seems to work, without all of the chemicals you find in store bought stuff. cool!</li>
    <li> I use it more than regular anti-persperant, but its WAY better than any deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Its replaced my Mitchum anti-perperant. Not sure how it works, Im guessing it kills the bacteria that creates odors , but its works on other part of the body as well, feet etc.    recommended. Plus a one year warranty? really that&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I am new to this product. I got a bit paranoid about the chemicals I subject myself to. Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Works for me without the sticky residue of most common brands of deodorants. I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and would recommend it as a healthy alternative to the normal store brands.</li>
    <li> I received a stained and bad smelling velvet pouch. Fortunately, the stone was wrapped in plastic. I threw the pouch away, so in fact I paid too much for just the stone.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using these Thai deodorant stones for at least 20 years. As someone who used to get rashes all the time from deodorant, I can&#x27;t say how freeing it&#x27;s been to not have to wear any for these past couple decades. We used to buy these at our local health food store but found that it was very inconsistent as to when they had them and when they didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s so easy to order from Amazon and they always seem to be in stock. If you&#x27;ve never used one, all I can tell you is it works. You just wet it and swipe it under your arms. No sweat stains. No odor. It was hard to believe, at first. Even when I used deodorant, it didn&#x27;t keep me dry. The stone can also be used on the soles of your feet. They last a really really long time (even when shared by a family) and when ours starts to get small then we buy a new one and put the smaller/older one in one of our travel/toiletry kits.</li>
    <li> Very smooth application with a wet stone. Haven&#x27;t had a real hot day yet, but works fine so far. If it continues to work I&#x27;ll never go back to regular deodorant.</li>
    <li> This stone didn&#x27;t work for me at all. It didn&#x27;t help with odor at all, and made things embarrassing on a night out. Would not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> Edited 03/14/13: Unfortunately, I had to discontinue use of this product due to the development of a rash in my underarms. Initially, there was an itch I thought nothing of, but that progressed to a painful redness that about drove me craze. It finally dawned on me that my body was having an issue with my stone. After a week or so the rash cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited about 3 months and tried again. I thought maybe there was some sort of incompatibility because of the summer heat. Well, after about a week I started to itch again. I knew right away what it was this time (I&#x27;m not always an idiot, no offense to idiots...) and dicontinued use immediately. I wish I could use the product as I am concerned about the aluminum in regular anti-perspirants, but alas. Anyone want to buy a slghtly used stone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;Hi! I bought this stone after a coworker harangued me for months about how aluminum in my deodorant/anti-perspirant was adversely affecting me. Since I am not as young as I once was I started to see some of his points of concern about how a cumulative effect of years of aluminum may possibly be adverse. I was concerned that some recent memory issues may have some correlation to chemical imbalances. Anyway, I bought this because I thought it was natural and the reviews were really positive. I have used it faithfully for over 3 months. Here is a brief summary of my observations. For general day to day use it works fine (I work in an office and am not tasked with physically demanding tasks). However, on occasion when I do have to get out and exert myself I do not find it to work as well as the aluminum based brands. There was an occasion recently when I was traveling and I packed and humped luggage through the airport on a hot summer day. BY the time I got in line for the plane I started smelling something, I though it was somebody standing by me, but no, it was me. My wife said she didn&#x27;t smell anything but I guess I caught a wiff because my nose was right there next to my armpits. Anyway, my conclusion is that for a day to day deodorant it works fine, rovided you will not be doing heavy work in the sun. One final thing to report, I don&#x27;t think my memory issues have improved since I switched, but perhaps the cumulated aluminum in my body is going to take a long time to burn out. In any case, I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using crystals like this for a couple of decades, and they really work. They also don&#x27;t leave any stain on your clothes. This one (the larger size) is a terrific value, and has a shape that makes it less likely to slip from your hands while it&#x27;s wet. (They will shatter if dropped on a hard surface.) I anticipate that this one will last me a couple of years, based on past experience.</li>
    <li> After getting a bad rash from more conventional, commercial products I tried this stone about 5 years ago. I am on my third which means that each one lasts me about 1 1/2 years. They work, I don&#x27;t smell and my clothes don&#x27;t have the stains on them that a lot of commercial products make.</li>
    <li> Does NOT work.  I really wish it did, but I think people are fooling themselves if they think this stuff works.</li>
    <li> I ordered this stone with very low expectations. I was using commercial, clinical strength, deodorant at the time, and even that wasn&#x27;t always 100% effective. I don&#x27;t know why, but in my mid to late 20&#x27;s, I started going through deodorant like crazy, and was becoming rather self-conscious about the issue. The clinical strength products worked fairly well for years, but were starting to lose their effectiveness and I found myself having to reapply a lot more often. My cousin is a naturalist-type, and recommended this product as an alternative to chemicals. Quite frankly, I thought she was nuts. If even the clinical strength products in the store weren&#x27;t working all the time, how could rubbing a wet rock under my arms work? Well, it did. And continues to work. I do find that you have to get the rock very wet, and really rub it on generously in the pits and surrounding area where sweat and odor tends to accumulate. If I do this each morning, there is no smell. None! Even after a three mile power walk through the Florida heat. I don&#x27;t know how it works, or why it works, but for me, the only thing that matters is that it DOES work. And it lasts a long time. I am only replacing mine now because it slipped out of my hand and broke on the tile floor. I could still use the pieces, but they are a bit jagged, and really, I&#x27;ve used it for more than a year. When I think of how much I would have spent on commercial deodorant in that time, I have no issue with coughing up the 8 bucks to replace my broken stone.</li>
    <li> The pouch was a nice touch and it has a container so it keeps clean in the bathroom, but this product didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> I used it for quite a few months and it did not hold up if I began to sweat even a little. I had high hopes after reading some of the reviews but it did not work.</li>
    <li> Yes, it really works!</li>
    <li> I love this so much better than the stone in a plastic holder. Doesn&#x27;t do much as in means of reducing sweat since it is supposed to have cornstarch in it to help with that. I do love this stuff though, I apply it right after the shower and again in the morning and it will last me all day and I tend to be pretty busy. Towards the end of the day I get a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s a lot better and more tolerable than the horrible smell you produce when you use the scented deodorants, and it is very faint and only noticeable if you directly smell your underarm. I love this stuff though, converted my mom, brother, an my boyfriend to using this stuff (Although not this particular one just yet, they still need to finish the ones I bought them last year!) Another great note is it lasts so long! Good for your body, and good for the bunnies. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I received the stone undamaged within a few days. The packaging was professional. The product is just as advertised. I feel that I can trust this merchant and will order from this merchant again.</li>
    <li> This was a repeat purchase and I received a stone that is twice as big as the &amp;#34;shell&amp;#34; the tray you keep the stone in.  I recommend the stone, but you&#x27;ll need a soap dish to keep it in.</li>
    <li> It was cheap and bizarre looking, so I bought the thing after getting a nasty rash from some kind of green colored deodorant that was wrecking the pits of all of my shirts with a brown discoloration.    Pros:  -IT WORKS; end of story. Bacteria cannot grow in the high salt concentration (at least nothing you&#x27;re going to find outside of a thermal vent or Mono lake!)  -No rash  -No shirt stains  -No weird odors  -NO ALUMINUM SALTS  -Lasts forever  -Great conversation starter hahaha    Cons:  -You MUST use it for multiple days or applications in a row before you see any change. You cannot put it on once every 3 days or something and expect to see a change. This is not really a con...As normal deodorant obviously requires every day application as well.  -Not an antiperspirant (because it has no harmful aluminum....also obvious)  -Do not store it in a humid environment....If you like long and warm showers, store it outside of the bathroom in a soap dish.    Overall:  I recommend this to everyone. It is THE cheapest, most effective, and the safest deodorant you will find.</li>
    <li> I admit that I purchased this product out of sheer curiosity. Could rubbing salt under your arm actually fight odors as well as modern deodorant or antiperspirant? Surely not, or these products would be sold in major retailers, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m happy to report that the deodorant stone does work. I was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fairly big guy. Not overweight, mind you, but big. I sweat through antiperspirant. All my shirts wind up with white stains under the armpits. In the summer I often have to wash my underarm and reapply my antiperspirant after a few hours of doing anything because I have sweat so much that I fear I might start to smell. So I was reluctant to start wearing this during the week when I might offend people in public. Instead, I tried it on a day off for the first time. I went to my sportsman club and spent a few hours on the shooting range and then took a short hike afterwards. It was warm out, and I was sweating by the time I left. When I got home, my wife claimed that I did not smell at all. The next day I played my drums like a madman for a few hours, and again no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have been using the deodorant stone every day with confidence. Yes, you will sweat when using this, so if underarm wetness bothers you, then this may not be for you, or you may need to use a powder in conjunction with the deodorant stone. I have taken to using a spritz of cologne after I shower, just because I no longer have the strong scent of my old antiperspirant covering up all other scents. But it&#x27;s great not having shirts ruined, and this will save hundreds of dollars when compared to buying a new antiperspirant stick every couple of weeks for a year.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the reading about antiperspirant deodorants and the risk of breast cancer. I found this alternative in Amazon and it really worked for me. I got it in a suitable time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> It was amazing for about 2 weeks now it wont work at all. I am not sure why or how but it just does not work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to most commercial deodorants so I am disappointed that this will not work for me.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant there is!</li>
    <li> I really like using this natural deodorant. It is a nice, large size that will surely last well over a year.</li>
    <li> I have used other crystal-type deodorants that did not work for me.  This one actually works 90% of the time (a few days I have found it didn&#x27;t do the job but not sure what was different on those days).</li>
    <li> This product works very well for me. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and work in an office so my workdays are temperature-controlled and not very intense, but with my standard deodorant, a close smell of my underarms revealed slight BO at the end of an average workday. With this stone, there is absolutely no scent at the end of the day--something I had my boyfriend confirm because you can get nose-blind to your own smell. I have experienced some mild wetness, but less than with my old deodorant and it doesn&#x27;t combine to make the goopy mess that it did with regular stick deodorant, and the wetness only comes with prolonged exposure to Southeast Texas summer heat and humidity. It also works for a long time--I apply daily during my work week after showering, but I typically let a Friday morning application last through Saturday with excellent results. Even though it is long-lasting for me, I generally reapply before workouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (hence 4 stars) for me is that it works so well that it can be very drying. After about a week, the chafing caused some irritation, pain, and itching. This was quickly overcome with a few nights of cortisone cream and now I moisturize my underarms nightly with organic oils. Nightly moisturization is a simple and effective means of overcoming what I see as the only drawback to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned, I think expectations (and also priorities) are key to maximum enjoyment of this product. One of the most important understandings a person should have when making the change to more natural body care products (and overall lifestyle) is this: The products we are used to using were developed in the first place to be improvements over the natural remedies previously available. Of course aluminum-based deodorant looks better, handles better, and for many people works better. That&#x27;s why it was invented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where priorities come into play--if you are serious about eliminating known and suspected toxins/carcinogens from your life, you are going to have to take some chances, invest (and lose) some money, and probably make some sacrifices in terms of convenience and &amp;#34;prettiness&amp;#34; of your body care. But if living a healthier life is what is important to you, wetting a stone before applying it and then slapping some lotion under your arms before bed are worthy sacrifices, as would be applying some essential oils to mask body odor if you still have it when using this product (I have ZERO!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s body is different, but as someone who struggled to get effective results from standard deodorants over the years, I feel like I am a pretty good test subject for this product, and I think that if applied correctly (wet the stone or your underarms and apply with full coverage after showering), this product is extremely effective and well worth the investment, and inexpensive enough to be worth a trial for anyone who is serious about an alternative to aluminum-based deodorants.d toxins/carcinogens from your life, you are going to have to take some chances, invest (and lose) some money, and probably make some sacrifices in terms of convenience and &amp;#34;prettiness&amp;#34; of your body care.

    <li> good product- using daily. lasts a year!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe this thai stone would work so I purchased men degree... Big mistake I don&#x27;t need degree!  and I enjoy taking a lush bath for I love soft sweet smells... I don&#x27;t like smelling like a man... I shower and before I dry off I use Thai all over and on my feet... and no musky smell!!!! I love it so much I am getting my sister, niece, and neighbor a bar... My adult children have used it and they all love it... My son say \\&quot;I am use to using degree\\&quot; but I use it for the smell\\&quot;... I told him enjoy it because that was the last time I will waist my money on it (degree)... He said he will buy Cologne.. They all love (Thai)it and I know my sister and others will love it as well... It is worth every penny, in fact I know I got a bargain...No more stains on clothes... Try it It Works!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Okay, so...I absolutely love this stuff.  It&#x27;s extremely easy to use (just rub a bit on right after the shower...no need to dry) and you&#x27;re good to go.  So listen hear folks...if you have very sensitive skin and you also know the importance of allowing your body to excrete toxins (sweat)...oh and also get that it&#x27;s not very nice to share your \\&quot;freshness\\&quot; with others then def take a chance on this rock!      I promise I&#x27;m not a sales rep, nor do I receive any kind of benefit from producing this review...I&#x27;m merely just the gal next door that has gone through so many awkward moments bc I was overly concerned about smelling badly.  I mean it even affected my education...I never wanted to get close with lab mates or professors during lab.  No bueno    Plus with a one year unlimited guarantee...ya can&#x27;t go wrong...Um not to mention the amount of money that you are going to be saving...I&#x27;m stoked peeps...totally stoked.  Plus I even used it this morn and had laser treatment done (hair removal) this afternoon w/out even needing to remove it.      Ahhh bliss. Okay, back to my Friday night...    Ciao    MKL    PS, Im one of MKL&#x27;s lab buddies and I gotta say, she smells fantastic!    LBCBAD</li>
    <li> I am a hairy, stinky 35 year old man.  I have struggled trying various types of deoderants over the years.  The ones that would actually work left god awful yellow pit stains on all my shirts that washing would not remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep this stone in its little tray in my shower holder.  After a shower, I use the stone on my underarms, feet, wherever.  Also, run it all the way down the area under your armpit where sweat may drip.  You have to cover a much greater area with this than with deoderant.  Then pat dry.  Voila! no more god awful pit stains!  I keep a small spray can of Axe in my truck for especially warm days if things get out of hand, but for the most part, this thing works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the stone has no anti-perspirant qualities, so you still sweat.  You just don&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> I genuinely stopped using anti-persistent and deodorant to try this for a week. I kept asking people if I smell. Everyone said \\&quot;You smell fine.\\&quot; and \\&quot;You smell like clean laundry.\\&quot; (which is just the smell of my shirts, not of the product)    I should also point out that when I do not use anything, I can smell me, and I don&#x27;t smell nice. :)    I have now been using it for 3 weeks. I still smell fine and I have stopped buying expensive deodorant.    The only actual issue is that it can be rough after a lot of use, but maybe I am doing something wrong. I chose not to read the instructions before using this product.</li>
    <li> My purpose of buying the crystal deodarant was to try to rid of the discoloration I got from Secret Deodorant.   I don&#x27;t like the idea of holding a dodorizer in your hands when applying, but it&#x27;s ok with this crystal, my hands just feel slightly dryer.  Which in a way is good if you have sweaty palms O_o    So far its just an ok product, I&#x27;ve tried the Crystal brand (ASIN: B000L978FU UPC: 086449300031)   before, it worked better than this Thai Deodorant toward the first few months, but than it seems like that was it...     I commute to work, taking the subway and the bus, and from what I&#x27;ve noticed, 1 of 5 times I can smell my B/O after I get home... that&#x27;s not something I want especially if the busses get crowded.     Ultimately I still prefer the Thai stone over the stuff you find in the markets...   3.5 - 4 stars for me.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty well, but be careful!  It&#x27;s slippery when wet, and shatters if dropped :(</li>
    <li> My girlfriend just bought this for me.  Now I sweat a lot under certain conditions, one of those being work.  When I am working the sweat is just to much and I get body odor.  Now on days I am not working and just hanging around the house this stone works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if you sweat a lot it does not work, but for an average or below average sweat it is great.</li>
    <li> Did the job!!! Amazing</li>
    <li> I buy these over and over as gifts when people as me about &amp;#34;that stone in my bathroom&amp;#34;, Everyone loves them because they WORK!</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic about how well the deodorant stone would work, but I really wanted to find a healthier alternative to deodorants containing aluminum, so I gave it a shot. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now, and so far I am very satisfied. I sweat a lot at work (too much information, sorry) but I only need to apply this once a day and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with body odor. This is such a healthy alternative to deodorants containing aluminum- the deodorant stone is all natural, and much better for your body. It&#x27;s very economic- one stone is guaranteed to last an entire year! I highly recommend the product!</li>
    <li> I bought this to try after having many of my shirts stained and ruined. After using this product, I realized the majority of the sweat and odor was actually from traditional deodorant. If I know I&#x27;m going to get sweaty, such as working out, I throw some baby powder on after. That takes care of moisture better than the stone by itself.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve changed the design; instead of a rounded cube, now it&#x27;s a flattened egg. At first I was like WTF but after using it for a while I&#x27;m very pleased with the new design, it&#x27;s much easier to grip and feels like it is easier to apply.</li>
    <li> The best deodarant you can buy. Very effective. Just put one in your shower area and use it when your armpits are wet daily after shower. You&#x27;ll never need another product that is as effective and safe as this. Should last pretty long as well so very cost effective as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really wanted to like a deodorant stone before- the only problem was, they never actually worked.  This one does.  Sure you will sweat and after a day doing yard work I imagine you would smell a bit but in the course of a regular work day or day of play you won&#x27;t wreak of Body Odor.  As they say, it works great on feet too. Yep, I like it.  Get it.</li>
    <li> Works decent.  I would not say it works for longer than a day or two.  Does not completely remove odor but I would say about 80%.  I would definitely recommend as an alternative to aluminum based deoderants.  I use it exclusively now.  Done with store bought deoderants.</li>
    <li> Oh  my  god  that&#x27;s  nice  thanks!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this deodorant stone, I was barely hopeful that it would work. I have seen the effectiveness of regular deodorants decline for me over the last few years and was getting desperate for SOMETHING that would help.  I read through many of the reviews left by others and then took the plunge. I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stone REALLY works! I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week, but it works! The unpleasant underarm smell I&#x27;d grown to know and hate has met its match! The stone has stopped it, or blocked it, or whatever, but I really don&#x27;t care how it works. I&#x27;m just thrilled that it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very important to remember to follow the instructions that come with it though. I know some reviews said they got nothing from it, and some even stated that it didn&#x27;t work for them till they realized that you were supposed to WET the stone before using it. That&#x27;s a very important step!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to why I left a four star instead of a five: It stops odor, but it did not stop wetness as it purports to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a great product though! I am recommending this to everyone in my family!</li>
    <li> I have used deodorant stones for a very long time. They work for me. You do have to be careful that you don&#x27;t drop them in the sink because they can break. Even so, its still worth it. I use regular deodorant the days I shave because the stone can sting if I use it right after I shave. In spite of those two allowances, I like using the stone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 15 years, and it works wonders--never any underarm smell, ever.  One stone lasts for years, so I&#x27;ve purchased only about three altogether.  This product is natural, safe, inexpensive, and highly effective.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this actually working. As much as I want to avoid perfumes and chemicals I did not want to go around smelly. The first day I could smell a hint of something different, Not really stink but a strange odor, the next day a little less. Buy the 3rd day nothing, No smell, Nothing. Only going on week 2 but so far I would recommend this product with no hesitation. Not sure if its a PH body thing that took a couple of days or something maybe I was doing because you do use it a bit differently. Initially I wondered 1. If its going on and 2. Am I using enough? But once you get it figured out it works fine. I would encourage anyone to give it a shot!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t poison yourself with aluminum chloride. These salt sticks work so well, and no bumps or problems. Leave them open to the air, tho, as they do pick up your body smell. You may need to reapply if you&#x27;ve been outside working and sweating. I use them, my husband uses them, and I give them as gifts all the time. My brother used to have a terrible problem with deoderant, because it made enormous, painful bumps under his arms. Not any more! He said it was one of the best gifts I&#x27;d ever given him.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to rate this five stars, but knowing that would go without most people reading the context of this review, I had to rate it three stars. The product does exactly what you [should] expect it to do. It is NOT a deodorant replacement. Unless you don&#x27;t like your friends very much. It is a complement to your existing product of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I say this is because, after having had this for about five months, I would never forego deodorant to wear this to work for 10 hours - and I am not a sweaty individual. It&#x27;s great for freshening up when I get home from work so I don&#x27;t have to waste deodorant making my bed smell like the Arctic (I wouldn&#x27;t recommend going there if you have a sensitive nose, apparently it smells like clean armpit) when I am just going to shower soon anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, it is a five star product for meeting expectations. But because I know people have unreasonable expectations for this and I don&#x27;t want to lead them astray with a five star review, it&#x27;s a three star product (and probably one star relative to the average deodorant as far as performance). But use it wisely and you&#x27;ll both save yourself some money in the long run without losing any friends and you&#x27;ll be helping the Earth while you&#x27;re at it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pouch is also nice. Definitely a five star pouch.</li>
    <li> 1. my stone arrived in one piece, not shattered, but other folks may not be so lucky considering that this really isn&#x27;t a &#x27;stone&#x27; at all - it is a formed &#x27;cake&#x27; made from - supposedly - ammonium alum, or perhaps potassium alum (preferred for shaving)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. the pouch is gimmicky; most folks just want to be able to use the cake for deodorant or as a post-shave treatment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. there is no detailed listing of ingredients other than &#x27;mineral salts&#x27; - a quick read online about alum should give you everything you need to know&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. these are not naturally occurring stones - higher quality cakes are translucent due to high-temperature forming - most are cloudy and possibly crumbly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. allow to air dry after use - do not store wet or you&#x27;ll end up with a mess&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. not a bad price for the amount, but not quality formed</li>
    <li> My husband and I each use these. Natural, no chemicals, last for ages, and actually work. Will stay with this product.</li>
    <li> where i would get a strange odor using a &#x27;conventional&#x27; deoderant, not so with this product.  sold on this, and will buy again next year.</li>
    <li> I like the product because it&#x27;s natural and my household is trying like mad to get away from chemicals. However, I found like I have to use it beyond liberally for it to work for any period of time. I have let my body adjust to natural products, but I&#x27;m still having to take the time for a liberal application. The other thing I don&#x27;t like about it, and this is probably because I&#x27;m clumsy, but it gets very slippery and I tend to drop it. Once I drop it and it cracks or splits apart, there are so many rough edges I end up cutting myself. On the other hand, it does work and the product itself lasts for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> The Thai stone is the best deorderant product I have ever found. It does take some getting used to, though if &#x27;moist pits&#x27; bother you. As other reviews have stated, you must start out with no odor in  your pits to begin with - it will not cover up any existing smell - it works by preventing the smell in the first place. (Evidently the salts prevent the growth of the odor-causing bacteria?).&lt;br /&gt;I suggest to use it liberally, not just &#x27;where the hair grows&#x27; in your pits - make a large circle and &#x27;fill it in&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;If you have an area that is prone to heat rash from perspiration sitting on your skin, you may still need to powder it or use some antiperspirant lightly right there, as the stone is deoderant only.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts through the gym, doing yard work, washing the car...&lt;br /&gt;It can sting freshly shaved pits.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend giving it a try</li>
    <li> Works great.  Arrived promptly.  What can I say? It&#x27;s a stone, and it keeps the odor down.  That is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> What a great product!!!!!!!! No BO and no aluminum and other chemicals from deodorant! It is amazing, it just completely gets rid of body odor with NO ill effects at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as I want to use less chemicals on my body.  Also, I heard aluminum in deodorant has been linked to breast cancer in which my grandmother and mother both developed.  Not sure if the information is 100% true but I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry.  Anyways, this works.  For a female, I sweat like a man and have used Mitchem for years; woman&#x27;s deodorants just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  Well anyways, this stone keeps me fresh.  I&#x27;ve worked out at the gym and sat in the sauna for 20+ minutes and the armpits are smell free.  And so easy to use.... wet under warm water and apply.  Just that easy.</li>
    <li> or it will crack into pieces or a couple of pieces or otherwise just crack and be not nearly as useful. Sorry for bad grammar but the SYSTEM needed more words.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Works better than synthetic store bought deoderant. Plus this stuff lasts forever! Love it!</li>
    <li> One of these stones lasts me 5-6 years; I have no idea how many roll-ons I&#x27;d have thrown away in that same time! I&#x27;m also one of those guys who sweats prolifically all over, so an antiperspirant is kinda like keeping the ballfield dry with two parasols.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some reviews here about how these do not keep smells away. I&#x27;ll tell MY story about that one: I got one of these for a friend, and a week later she called to say it wasn&#x27;t working. \\&quot;Two hours out of the shower and I stink! And I rub myself raw with the thing &amp; it still doesn&#x27;t work, I swear I&#x27;m chafing my armpits here...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about that for a moment. \\&quot;Umm...are you WETTING the stone and then applying it?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;No, I dry off &amp; then rub, what&#x27;s the point of being wet already - oh. - OH. ...Sooo, it&#x27;s like, dissolving a little of the stuff onto my skin, right?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;...Right...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;That was three years ago, and she&#x27;s used it since.</li>
    <li> Works really well, and so convenient to take to the pool.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  The stone works well, it does what its supposed to do, it keeps you from stinking! And it does so without all the artificial stuff in other deodorants!</li>
