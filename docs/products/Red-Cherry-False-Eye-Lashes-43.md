<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> best lashes ever gives you the cat eye look ;)</li>
    <li> so natural and fluffy</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are incredibly light in weight and you don&#x27;t even notice they&#x27;re on because they&#x27;re so soft and comfortable.  You can also reuse a pair of these lashes if you clean the eyelash glue with a makeup remover wipe.  Pretty durable!</li>
    <li> These lashes are nice, good quality but very long, longer than is necessary.  The next time I wear them I will trim them down.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Red Cherry falsies and they are HEAVEN!!!!! Gorgeous length beautiful texture! Someone thought they were my natural lashes, I wished they were!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s dance competitions.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Love how sturdy they are, I can reuse them at least 5 times! The clear band looks really natural, and they&#x27;re super easy to apply!</li>
    <li> Love them! Theyre so comfortable an natural looking</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product! When putting them on one of my clients though they were a little overwhelming at first! Very long lashes! Once the look was done though they were perfect! I liked that they weren&#x27;t so LONG across that they needed to be cut to fit the length of her lid. Definitely happy with them and will likely be buying again for wedding season!</li>
    <li> Love these lashes but the red cherries don&#x27;t really last that long compared to other strip lashes. I can get maybe 2-3 wears per pair with no mascara when I can get maybe 4-6 wears out of an Ardell lash with no mascara. But I love the style of these, they are my go to lash, they aren&#x27;t too dolly and aren&#x27;t too natural. My eyes are small almond eyes and these look nice on me.</li>
    <li> These were a bit more extravagant than I thought, but looked great for parties, night out etc.. Very light weight and easy to apply. This 6 pack should last me for a while ;-)</li>
    <li> My eyes are a little but longer than these lashes so they can look funny if I don&#x27;t get them on just right but they are beautiful!</li>
    <li> I love love love the red cherry # 43 lashes they look so natural plan to order plenty more</li>
    <li> Huge fan of red cherry and at these prices they can&#x27;t be beat. I would definatly tell people to buy this.</li>
    <li> Makeup artist here. Ive tried many lashes before...but these I can get a lot if uses from them. One pair last up to 3weeks</li>
    <li> Way too long to wear to work.  Wish the description had described the length.  All these eyelashes I cannot use.</li>
    <li> Bought these for fun and they are so pretty on. Bought my daughter a set also. Easy application and recommend anyone interested in buying these.</li>
    <li> love it! my favorite red cherry lashes. comparable to ardell  wispies lashes</li>
    <li> this is one of the best false eye lashes I ever use.. it gives that adorable final touch for the make up.. and this is a perfect choice fr all time</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! Best lashes I&#x27;ve ever worn, wish I could repurchase them from this seller!</li>
    <li> These are my go to lashes because I love the flared Bambi eyed look. Shipping is so fast! I received them on Monday even after purchasing them on black Friday!</li>
    <li> too long though but over all its nice..natural looking not shiny at all..</li>
    <li> The lashes were unkept, look used or noy kept in welll conditions</li>
    <li> This is not the red cherry brand listed in the pictue. It is a false advertisement. better off going to the store and buying ones that are the real red cherry brand.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured.love every one of the</li>
    <li> The Red Cherry 43s are voluminous and long, you can wear them for daytime but only if you&#x27;re okay with making a bit of a statement.  They are a natural shape and fullness and are beautiful, I wear them often day/evening.  They are a tad short across your eye (if you have big eyes), if you usually have to trim lash bands, you will not have to with thse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the 415s are longer across the lid, and slightly shorter in lash length.  218s are another solid choice, less criss-cross volume making them a bit less natural.</li>
    <li> Do not like these eyelashes. They are way longer than I imagined and almost look funny if I try to wear them. Hopefully can use them for halloween or something. Shipping was very fast!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used false eyelashes, always relied on 4 coats of mascara to do the job for me. I&#x27;ve even paid a ton to get extensions professionally! However I find these lashes to be a great go between. I do like a very dramatic eye look and these work perfectly, without all my lashes falling out or having to break the bank! As a beginner I can get 2-3 wears out of each pair. Very happy with this purchase and my new skill of applying lashes. (Much easier than you think even with an unsteady hand...)</li>
    <li> Never wore red cherry lashes before but I&#x27;ve heard great things about them. So of course I had to try. I always wear lashes and there are lashes I don&#x27;t wear &amp; lashes that suit my eye shape. The packaging was good the product it&#x27;s self was good. The lashes are really thin and whimsy an light. Definitely good for people who don&#x27;t have hooded lids. Unfortunately for me I do so when wearing these the inner corner of my eye where the lashes fall they point down instead of up. These lashes are good for doubling to make a more dramatic look. Otherwise I have nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> love this eyelashes. they are easy to put on and you can use them more than once love them recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> Favorite lashes by far!</li>
    <li> Love them. I wear falsies every day.  They came quick, and in perfect condition! I ordered #43, would like to try some different # lashes!</li>
    <li> Were not the same lashes shown in the picture when receiving them in the mail. Not sure if they were an older version of Red Cherry&#x27;s or just a complete lower-quality replicate. Did plenty of research on how there were actually SUPPOSE to look. However, they were decent and I did like the way they looked when trying them on. So didn&#x27;t really care because the end results were still fine. Would I purchase again? Probably not at all. Though it is worth a one time purchase.</li>
    <li> So lightweight and realistic, you forget they&#x27;re there. They are perfect for everyday use! Once I finish using these, I will order again!</li>
    <li> I love Red Cherry. The #43 lashes are looooong, but wearable. Definitely dramatic looking. Be sure to pair them with bold makeup!</li>
    <li> Very natural and wonderful</li>
    <li> Red Cherry #43 lashes are my favorite lashes to use on myself and my clients! They are very easy to use and the band is clear which makes it less visable. I also love the fact that they are made from 100% human hair!</li>
    <li> Love these lashes and got so many compliments! They are easy to apply, last all night, and can be used again a time or two..also a great price and quality product!</li>
    <li> I usually love all Red Cherry lashes, and these are no different, they are a fraction longer than the Christina lashes, but still a little short for my eyelids. Hey there are always different styles of Red Cherry eyelashes to buy...right.</li>
    <li> I was real happy with this purchase. These false lashes are gorgeous. It was convenient and stress free to order.</li>
    <li> favorites. they look so natural even without eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Red Cherry lashes are the best! I tried #43 lashes for the first time and I loved them! Thank you! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and very comfortable to wear.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to anyone interested in wearing these!</li>
    <li> Red cherry lashes are the best lashes ever. 100% human hair. Don&#x27;t weigh down eyelids or feel weird. Easier to apply than any other brand I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve ordered several different, and more of the same (all red cherry) and will get more. Great price, especially with Amazon prime. Plus you get it in 2 days that way.</li>
    <li> Take your lashes to another level with these beautiful lashes! I think they are similar to Ardell 105, but this is a much better product. It&#x27;s lighter product and looks natural even with the &amp;#34;unbelievable&amp;#34; length. These lashes are flirty fun.</li>
    <li> The lashes were a little dramatic for me. However, I did wear it out and it looked fine. If you&#x27;re a fan of this style then you should def purchase.</li>
    <li> Obviously the best eyelashes ever. They last very long if you take proper care of them. They look natural with just a hint of drama. Very girly eyelashes, this is my second time ordering in bulk of these lashes.</li>
    <li> They are nice, but because I am not familiar with this brand I ordered by looks. They are almost 1 inch long lashes, talk about NOT fooling anyone, or looking lush natural. Not the sellers fault, but I just wasted money on lashes that I believe are stage lashes.</li>
    <li> I placed my order on thrusday and got it by Saturday  . Best quality for the price. I will be purchasing more styles from cherishlook ;)</li>
    <li> these eyelashes are perfect for when you want a very dramatic look. i will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Lashes were to long to wear,they look very fake! Sorry wish I could wear them. :( would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> Skip over Katy Perry&#x27;s brand, for the price of one set you can have these. Quality, flexible, easy to put on dramatic lash.</li>
    <li> Great product exactly as pictured. Good quality strip lashes. Amazing price compared to other sites. Definitely worth ordering again. Great.</li>
    <li> These lashes are too long that they look funny when put on. I guess these are more suitable for theatrical makeup.</li>
    <li> red cherry lashes are over all amazing! You can barely see the band, My all time favorite lashes with out a doubt</li>
    <li> These are wonderful and they open up my hooded eyelids. I don&#x27;t use mascara on them so they last longer. I&#x27;ve used one pair eight times. Just use the dark Duo.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them on but they look and feel amazing. I cant wait to try them on, true value.</li>
    <li> for what you are getting, the eyelashes are pretty pricey. But they do not feel heavy, so that is a plus!</li>
    <li> I really like these lashes.. Have been using them everyday since I&#x27;ve bought them. They look natural because they are not too thick. If you want them to be thicker, just double them up for a more dramatic look. I&#x27;ve tried that as well for a weekend outing.. I was really impressed. I will surely be buying these again.&lt;br /&gt;Signed, a very happy customer in Houston, Texas.</li>
    <li> Definitely more of a glam lash. The band is very flexible and durable. Not everyday eyelashes. Very long and full.</li>
    <li> These are very glamorous, and very long! Gorgeous and fun for going out, but a little too long for everyday use. They are reusable many times when cared for properly. They are beautiful!</li>
    <li> I love these lashes this is my go to # size lashes I stock up for this amazing price.... You get so many uses for one paid if you take care of them you can get many uses for them</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I have received so many compliments on these lashes, I had to! Everywhere I go, perfect strangers ask me about my eyelashes!  They are amazed at how real they look.  I will stick with Red Cherry!  They are the very best!</li>
    <li> I bought these after seeing and reviews on YouTube. It seemed like they would have been very natural looking and would give you a bit more length. They have a lot of length. Not the natural ones I was hoping for but they are beautiful if you&#x27;re looking for something a bit more dramatic, then these are perfect. They are also very easy to work with.</li>
    <li> These lashes are the only ones I&#x27;ve never had to cut to fit my eye. They seem of decent quality. Was hoping that they would be a little more dramatic. They give my lashes a little more fullness, but these seem more for every day wear and not really best for a costume or performing.</li>
    <li> Came immediately. Reusable. Top quality! Just the look I wanted. Fabulous and realistic yet stunning. Id recommend this, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality of lashes! However, they&#x27;re a bit dramatic and unbelievable. They look nice and flirty with a cat eye. Not for everyday. Love the price and bulk package. Wish I would&#x27;ve gotten a more natural red cherry model. Also my logo on my boxes were different than pictured, don&#x27;t know what that means.</li>
    <li> These are very pretty and I will use for special occasions. I wear my lashes everyday and while I really loves these I wont wear them everyday because they are too long for that.</li>
    <li> I gave Red Cherry eyelashes a 5 star rating because they don&#x27;t disappoint.  They are great quality and you hardly feel like you&#x27;re wearing eyelashes.  You can use each set more than once and get your moneys worth.  I will be buying from again.</li>
    <li> these are long full lashes but the band is not wide enough.  I end up putting them closer to the outside corner of my eyes and they don&#x27;t blend in too well with my natural lashes because of that.</li>
    <li> What a great deal. I love these lashes.</li>
    <li> I LOVEEEEE THESE EYELASHES So Long &amp; natural looking great Size bands &amp; it&#x27;s just like the Package , shipping was just as they Said &amp; I still have 3 more left , going order A BUNCH More great investment in eyelashes! Won&#x27;t be disappointed! Looks great with or without Massacra</li>
    <li> Love these Eyelashes! Look great and very easy to apply!</li>
    <li> Great lashes, super soft and easy to apply. They would look a lot more natural if they weren&#x27;t so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably cute for festivals or concerts, not so much clubbing, casually, or nights out.</li>
    <li> These lashes are fantastic.  Long, thick, wispy and easy to apply.  The band is flexible and thin making it easier to achieve a more seamless look.  They are extremely long but could probably be easily trimmed to the desired length.  I was a true Ardell fan and these Red Cherry lashes are much better at an even better price!</li>
    <li> They are beautiful and comfortable. They also fit the length of my eye perfectly so there&#x27;s no need to trim! However, these are super long, and look obviously fake, on me at least.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Great product!!! Not for everyday use but perfect for a special ocassion since they are very dramatic!!! Highly recommend!!! Just in time for Valentine&#x27;s day...</li>
    <li> RECEIVED in a bat of an eye;)</li>
    <li> I read countless reviews and watched so many youtube videos about these lashes.  People raved about how they are &amp;#34;SOOOO NATURAL LOOKING!&amp;#34; and how they wear them everyday while getting compliments from people saying they can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re fake.&lt;br /&gt;These are SUPER long.  They do not look natural whatsoever.  I don&#x27;t even know if I would wear these on a night out, let alone during the day just running around doing errands or going out to lunch.&lt;br /&gt;However, I will say they are really light weight and the hair itself is very natural, but, the length is NOT natural at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for everyday lashes like I was, I would skip over #43.</li>
    <li> I was never able to put fake eyelashes on until I got these. They are so easy to use and look amazing.</li>
    <li> Great just as all the other ones I buy! My fav lash brand and fav eyelashes are #43!</li>
    <li> Yes yesssssssssssssssss!! full, long and beautiful but not super fake and shiny. oh yessss oh yess! So you cant really go wrong with red cherry.</li>
    <li> Looked fake. Wore them out to the bar and even then my friends called me out...</li>
    <li> Verrrrry fake looking and way too long. Had to cut mine.</li>
    <li> These look so fake its ridiculous.  Even after carefully trimming them down, they still looked stupid.  I guess if you are going for the &amp;#34;doll-like&amp;#34; look these might work.</li>
    <li> I have worn fake eyelashes for years and the best I&#x27;ve ever found was at Walmart.  The Walmart ones only lasted me a couple days but these come with so many and the price is great.  Also, the one purchase has lasted me a little more than a month, but I do take care of my eyelashes.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will never shop anywhere else for eyelashes again!</li>
    <li> I never ever leave reviews but after having these lashes now for around 3 months..I am in love! not only are they comfortable and natural looking but they are also so durable and beautiful! Like I said I ordered these in October and have made six pairs last till now and I still have one pair left! I&#x27;m amazed! If you are considering buying these, and you aren&#x27;t sure, trust me and buy them!! You will not be disappointed, Also they look really nice with a dramatic cat eye and red lips! I cant say enough good things about these lashes.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are perfect for helping me look awake especially when I highlight  under my eyes for that bright and refreshed appearance it makes my eyes really stand out and look attractive I love these lashes so far ! And there&#x27;s no need for cutting them they aren&#x27;t super long width wise ...which is nice but they are lengthy as far as the lash hairs ! They are very similar to the regular ardell whispy lashes exept they are not all one length , it&#x27;s more gradual.</li>
    <li> These lashes are great. They are sturdy but the glue line is soft so they are really easy to apply correctly. I will warn you though, they are very dramatic. I looked down during a photo while wearing these and you could see a stark line between my real lashes and these, so don&#x27;t do that! LOL I wore them for my anniversary and hubby liked them a lot. I would definitely say if you want a celebrity, red carpet type look, these are a sure fire way to go! They are also really good for the price.</li>
    <li> These are huge and super long! Not quite what I expected, after watching Jaclyn Hill on YouTube because they seem to fit her face so well. But it&#x27;s all good because I cut them in half to use as corner lashes so I&#x27;m happy with that..</li>
    <li> Pretty lashes but it was too long for asian eyes, had to trim all the pairs down.. Not recommended for asian eyes lol</li>
    <li> Love them!!!! They are the only eye lashes that have looked nice on me! Love the price! I reccomend it!</li>
    <li> Red Cherry #43 are my absolute favorites! Although I also love the Andrea 33&#x27;s these are just the best! Definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Wow, very very long.  Too much for me.</li>
    <li> These are the best lashes ever.  Simply gorgeous on.  Red Cherry is my go to lash for all occasions.  I recently purchased a ton of different styles.  Cant go wrong with these.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and comfortable wear</li>
    <li> They are my 2nd fav. Is only reason for 4 star.. Decent quality. Easy to place and reusable. I-Envy are the best!</li>
    <li> I wear them regularly and they work great.. I can get about a weeks use out of each pair. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Perfect fit!  looks natural! Good for going out on the town or just your normal, casual day. Highly recommend for anyone</li>
    <li> Hard to tell by the picture.I thought I was getting a normal looking eyelash...However they were quite dramatic looking. Not at all what I wanted.</li>
    <li> super quick shipping and the lashes look great :)</li>
    <li> Love them! So natural looking.. ordered them on a Thursday night and received them in the mail by Saturday! Would totally recommend them.. will be ordering more soon!</li>
    <li> These are the best lashes I&#x27;ve ever bought. The number 43&#x27;s are the best so far from Red Cherry!&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot of compliments all the time...asking if they are real....these look very natural. They are beautiful! and you also get 6 pairs for a great price! Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved these they look super cute was shipped and recieved in no time.Don&#x27;t think twice buy them so cute!</li>
    <li> There Reaally Pretty and Long Would Definatly. Re-Purchase When I&#x27;m Out Of These Wonderful Lashes,....I Think Its More For A Nightout Look super GORGEOUS!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love these lashes. Every style fits differently and should fit your face. These are very glamorous and feel so light, great seller!</li>
    <li> It goes without saying, these lashes are BEAUTIFUL. They are my absolute favorite false lashes. However, EVERY single time I order from these guys they ship INSANELY fast and it&#x27;s packaged pristinely. Happy yet again and will absolutely order from them every single time!</li>
    <li> My favorite lashes, very natural!!!</li>
    <li> Very good quality and reusable.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes!  Wear #43&#x27;s frequently.  Great price!  Delivered on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> These have been recommended by a number of beauty gurus, but I found them a bit longer than I had hoped.  I will say they are growing on me after I&#x27;ve worn them 2 or 3 times.  I may reorder.</li>
    <li> These are super long. Perfect for special event or going out. I don&#x27;t even wear these often when I go out to the club because they are so long. Still beautiful lashes.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes. They tend to look a bit dramatic on my smaller eyes, but I like it. The band is not so thick like other lashes out there, so it&#x27;s very flexible. I have to cut a bit of it to fit on my eyes, but otherwise I love them.</li>
    <li> best brand there is out there</li>
    <li> They look very fake. I will have to trim them back to not look like a streetwalker.</li>
    <li> These are amazing!!! I have used the same pair for 3 weeks now and they still look great.</li>
    <li> these are great quality &amp; even came witha  hand written note.  i gave some to my mom and i am able to reuse when i take care of them i don&#x27;t buy my eyelashes anywhere else.  great price and great service . highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love them but too thin and dramatic for everyday use...</li>
    <li> Flawless and easy application. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Received the 6 pairs as purchased and the the lashed look good. Waiting on a good occasion to wear them and not waste them!</li>
    <li> Almost comparable to MAC lashes.</li>
    <li> So I was skeptical about buying these after reading some reviews. But Im glad I did!! They are great. Made me eyes look so pretty and flirty and close up pics came out so nice. They are Lightweight so doesnt weigh your eye down like some do and easy to put on... They are a little long best suitable for people with a&amp;#34; big eye space &amp;#34; like me so they dont reach your &amp;#34;brows&amp;#34;. They are comparable to Ardell Wispies but I like these better. Cant beat the price for 6!. Will be buying more ;)!!!!</li>
    <li> Red cherry #43 lashes are very full, long and beautiful. I purchased these to wear to parties and special occasions. I&#x27;ve not worn false lashes before so it was rather startling seeing myself with them on. Although I have to admit false lashes are not for me. My natural lashes are rather long and full on their own so for me they just didn&#x27;t feel right. I have a co-worker who wears them everyday so I gave the remaining 5 pairs to her and she absolutely loves them. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who likes to wear these and is more adept at putting them on than me.</li>
    <li> The lashes look very natural but still dramatic. they are very light so they are comfortable to use. I 100% recommend those. plus you can use 1 pair few times so it&#x27;s really good bargain :))))</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! Especially a lot of my clients love them. I use them a lot for my Brides. It gives enough volume, length and lifts the eyes.</li>
    <li> not as dramatic as I wanted.  they are nice but I wanted thicker, fuller and more dramatic.  Great if you are looking for a natural look.  Great value</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like them to long for me</li>
    <li> they were too long for my middle aged eyes.</li>
    <li> Love these will def order some more!</li>
    <li> Great lashes. Pretty quick. Comfortable and flexible. For beautifully dramatic looks.</li>
    <li> They are light on the led but they are super long ( dramatic ) type of lashes&lt;br /&gt;I like them but M not gonna use them unless I cut (short&#x27;n ) them :(</li>
    <li> i looooove these. I buy them all the time. and having them come in a 6 pack is so great. worth it. I love these lashes more than ardell.</li>
    <li> Fiancee loves them! She says they feel like they are not even there and very comfortable. If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Ok so, I&#x27;ve been using red cherry lashes since forever it&#x27;s the only brand I use for such a cheap price. I usually buy them at beauty supply stores in my city and they range from 1.50-3.99 so I decided to go ahead and buy 6 pair for 10$. One pAir of eyelashes usually lasts me between 2-3 weeks depending on how I take care of them. I love these lashes.</li>
    <li> Love these eyelashes! Def recommend</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and natural looking not as dramatic wen u put it on they look very nice!</li>
    <li> I love red cherry lashes. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more. These are dramatic but on a everyday level. You can get away with it, I wore them for a sephora interview. The lady loved them.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these lashes</li>
    <li> These false eyelashes are a great way to make your eyes pop!  They are the first set of false eyelashes that I didn&#x27;t have to trim down!  I will definitely be buying these again!  Amazing price for a bulk purchase!!</li>
    <li> Review from my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I love these lashes! They are so light on the eyes and fit well. They are more on the natural end but give the fuller longer lash-look. Easy to reuse at least twice - which I did. Highly recommend these.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love these lashes!! Get so many compliments when I wear them. Comfortable, unlike other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Definitely will buy again</li>
    <li> Such an awesome price for these.  I haven&#x27;t put them on yet, but will tomorrow.  They look and feel fabulous though!</li>
    <li> Love love loveeeee these lashes! I received so many compliments on them... And I can also get at least 4 wears out of them. Will be reordering!</li>
    <li> OMG!!! SoOO  Full and Glamorous!!! This babies will make your eyes POP</li>
    <li> Love these. Dramatic, but beautiful. Thin band so you don&#x27;t have to wear liner if you don&#x27;t want to. Light weight and comfortable. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my lashes! They look so beautiful on and really makes my eyes look pop. The bargain for a bulk of Red Cherry lasheswas wonderful and cheap! they really feel nice and the band is thin, well be ordering again when I run out.</li>
    <li> These (and this brand) are the most comfortable and realistic looking lashes I have found. Why so cheap? I don&#x27;t know but I am not complaining!</li>
    <li> They were well worth the money. They were easy to use and the lash band was really flexable not stiff like other ones! Sg</li>
    <li> best for its price! i love red cherry, glad amazon carries it! will order some more! thanks again guys. you rock</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Ive worn them up to 7 times and they still look amazing! I loved the personalized note :) I will for sure be ordering again soon!</li>
    <li> Love these! Such a great deal!</li>
    <li> Best eyelashes on the market especially for the price. My eyes are small so I just snip a few millimetres of the end. These lashes make your eyes pop!</li>
    <li> You do not have to spend $20 per pair when everyone wears out lashes differently.  I may wear mine 3 - 5 times at the most.  These eyelashes are a good price.  I even purchase them from near my house.  I love them because they suit my eyes better.  I have small almond looking eyes and sometimes even when you cut them to fit, they never fit right.  These lashes bend easily and I have minimal problems applying them.  I also get alot of compliments on my lashes.  I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> I think that Red Cherry lashes are great quality for the price. But I have a rather small face and hooded eyes, and these lashes go up to my eyebrows. Which ends up looking like too much.</li>
    <li> Good quality but a little long.,</li>
    <li> While these lashes are easy to use and feel nice, #43 were still incredibly long and obviously unnatural. I love some drama, but these were just too long. Red cherry does make some nice lashes though and are my favorite brand.</li>
    <li> Best lashes ever. I have worn them everyday for about 2 weeks now and they are still perfectly in shape. Perfect amount of volume and length without it looking crazy or over the top.</li>
    <li> I ordered the eyelashes and it came in perfect condition, deliverd as promised, and I would most definitely come back and purchase again. No drugstore or cosmetic department carries this particular eyelash I use so I am extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> So I put them on today and I totally love them the texture is super soft they&#x27;re long, feathery looking they almost touch my eyebrows..</li>
    <li> I will admit, these lashes are made of a good material. They are very flexible and soft; the lashes themselves feel very natural. Application is simple and the band easily conforms to your eye shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, these lashes scream &amp;#34;over-the-top.&amp;#34; They are extremely long and are millimeters away from touching my eyebrows. If you&#x27;re looking for lashes that enhance the natural look of your eye but are not too obvious, there are NOT the lashes for you. They have an extremely long, feathery look to them. Definitely not for an everyday look and perhaps too much even for some special occasions. I&#x27;ve had these for quite a while and have only used two out of the six, and even then I trimmed them so much that they looked nothing like the originals. I personally like it best when my false lashes are subtle enough to fool people into thinking that they&#x27;re my own, but I could see these working well for someone who wants their makeup to really stand out.</li>
    <li> The Red Cherry #43  lashes are a great product. Every person I have placed them on looked fabulous. They are a bit long so someone with small eyes will need to have the  lashes trimmed  on the sides.</li>
    <li> Not the perfect ones in the market but they do the job for my girl. for the price they are perfect</li>
    <li> These false lashes look very fake on my eyes lashes and they poke my eye ball, but if you can deal or are just wanted to try out false lashes for the first time I would try these because they are cheap.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering these lashes my the 100&#x27;s they are amazing beautiful and SOOOOO comfortable I forget I have them on. They are long and full. I love them.</li>
    <li> eyelashes were WAY TOO LONG.. didn&#x27;t look good at all.  I was very disappointed.  Even when I tried to cut them down some, they looked awful, couldn&#x27;t wear them.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite lashes! They are dramatic though so they are more of a night time lash, unless you just like to have fun with lashes during the day like me! lol I love that they are tapered, they give a really nice almond shape to the eye and they are so easy to wear! This price is great and they got to me super fast! Love them!</li>
    <li> Loved these lashes will purchase lots more!</li>
    <li> I have worn a ton of different brands, lengths, and styles of false eyelashes and Red Cherry #43 is by far the best! Fits the shape of my eye perfectly and looks natural.</li>
    <li> I was a beginner when I ordered these. I saw these used in a YouTube video of an awesome MUA. I love these lashes. Easy to put on and they look fabulous. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;~Shelly</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Will buy again!!</li>
    <li> High quality and exactly what I ordered. Extremely happy</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them! I&#x27;ve been using these for quite some time. They are super light weight an easy to apply!</li>
    <li> Great natural looking lashes! Shipping was FAST!</li>
    <li> red cherrry lashes are so pretty so soft and just great quality. just know they are fairly long so know that if you have small eyes it may not be the best choice. these are GORGEOUS on my eyes however!</li>
    <li> These eyashes are great. I will certainly be purchasing more if these.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and great lashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to false eyelashes, but these are just not great. Decent quality and great price, but they are so long they look like cheapies bought from a costume store. Not a natural look at all, and I&#x27;m really dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I love these eyelashes!  I always buy them in bulk so I don&#x27;t run out.  People who know me know that my lashes are not real, but those who don&#x27;t have no idea.  I get compliments all the time how people love my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> These are fine, but ridiculously fake looking. They reached my eyebrows when I put them on. I felt like a drag queen. Returning them.</li>
    <li> Somehow these manage to look maximum full and sexy, yet not ridiculous. I think it&#x27;s the shape where they&#x27;re shorter at the inner corners. When curled and blended it with your natural lashes, they manage to take on a high-fashion yet convincing and complementary look. People will ask with astonishment after several hours of hanging out if I&#x27;m wearing falsies (when I turn to the side and they can see the fullness of the curl), but they&#x27;re never sure and they don&#x27;t notice at first - just that it looks good. Very flattering for all kinds of eye looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these with duo dark glue, and wash and reuse them a few times. They hold up pretty well compared to other false lashes.</li>
    <li> This are good Quality lashes but they way to long and kind of uncomfortable to wear.. they look funny</li>
    <li> Love them!!! The eyelashes itself are beautiful! The deal is great and the shipping was fast! Ordered more :)</li>
    <li> great quality, natural looking lashes</li>
    <li> I wear these everyday.... Great Lashes</li>
    <li> great lashes, not too exaggerating</li>
    <li> Love these!! Way better than Ardell :)</li>
    <li> They are very pretty, good quality. If you take care of them they can definitely last a long time. I may try other models next time that look more wispy but I have no complains. Also the price is great.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Worked well.  I recommend these</li>
    <li> Relly nice and very confortable</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these lashes they&#x27;re so natural but they do run a little bit long at least for my eyes my eyelashes are a little bit small more medium length but putting on these lashes with a little bit of mascara.... I&#x27;m obsessed with them already on my second order I definitely recommend to anybody who wants longer fuller eyelashes it makes your eyes pop!</li>
    <li> I was amazed on how fast I received them, but not only did they arrive faster then I thought but they are really beautiful lashes and inexpencive..Im very happy.</li>
    <li> These are by far my favorite false lashes! They came fast shipping and in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;I wear these to work or going out. depending on my make up they can increase a smokey eye or just intensify your natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I dont have to cut these to fit my eye either.</li>
    <li> Came quick awesome quality will def last me a while would def recommend them</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t try it yet but seems they are good in quality..will see and thanks</li>
    <li> I LOVE red cherry because of the thin band.  They look the most natural against the lash-line.  The hairs are also great because they don&#x27;t look like plastic.  These are great everyday lashes with a bit of added glam!</li>
    <li> favorite wispy but glam lashes!</li>
    <li> I love red cherry lashes. They last longer and look natural. Easy to store and reuse. The shipping was estimated to take a little over a week, it ended up taking over 3 weeks that&#x27;s why 4 stars. I&#x27;d give the lashes 5 stars if the shipping wasn&#x27;t so slow.</li>
    <li> My lashes got here super fast after I ordered them...I LOVE the lashes...they are so flattering and I adore them.  Great service, fast, and I can&#x27;t complain at all.  Wonderful job.  Just ordered some more from Yonelay!</li>
    <li> I really love these lashes!!!! Looks natural and it&#x27;s easy to apply. Highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Lashes blend very well, look amazing on. They are a bit long so you may have to cut them depending on eye shape. I have nothing to compare to because I LOVE THEM!!!&lt;br /&gt;If applied correctly they are comfortable and look like they are your own lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will repurchase!</li>
    <li> These lashes look natural and feel great. They are more for a special occasion look because of how full they are. They are amazing quality and can be reused several times, if taken care of properly.</li>
    <li> This lashes is pretty but it&#x27;s not what I would wear everyday</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews but why not? I love these lashes! I don&#x27;t use them too often because they are pretty long and I have small eyes but for a night out with the right make up, it really makes a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these lashes to anyone going for a natural look. If you want to see these lashes applied go to the video that made me want these ones myself! http://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RgXBD7KOxV0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways hope I helped.</li>
    <li> Great lashes. I purchase these every time i buy lashes.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes! They are comparable to the ardell wispies, only these are bigger! I am very satisfied and will be ordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Obsessed. FAVORITE lashes ever. Great deal and great quality</li>
    <li> my favorite lashes they  look natural on me and i get tons of compliments! great for day or night use!!!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite lashes by far!!They last forever and look very natural looking could not ask for anything better! Will buy again</li>
</ol>
