<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love! This actually smells really good. I was expecting a wierd smell or a medicine smell but it didnt smell like that at all</li>
    <li> My hair smells great everyday and look great! My hair is always smooth and soft after use and i can feel my hair coming back to life. I have very thin hair and am happy to have found something that is already helping with my hair growth!</li>
    <li> Smells great, no residue, after regular styling leaves my hair feeling nice and soft. My hair feels a lot ticket too</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!! It makes my hair feel silky smooth and it smells great!!! I already bought another bottle. &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> I found it odd at first since the product doesnt produce much bubbles. Overall, I have noticed a relatively less hair fall.</li>
    <li> The Keraplex Organica Shampoo left my hair feeling clean, soft without residue, and thicker ftom the first shampoo.  The volume is amazing, and the fragrance is appealing. I absolutely love this shampoo. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> smells good, feels good, only been using for a few days so not sure on the results. I will update if I say a change. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out so thats a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used organic shampoos before, but none have been like this one! Most organic shampoos smell horrible. But this smells fantastic!! Nice and clean. Not weird. It lathers nicely and leaves hair feeling full and thick!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Yippie!  My wife divorced me cuz I was losing hair, basically ignored her but now I got a chance!  Just got it today...used already and smells yummy.  Will be back with results...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a week and have not seen a change other than my hair is drier. I am going to finish out the bottle and hope for better results in another week.</li>
    <li> Cool shampoo. It has a unique scent. Not sure if it will reduce my hair loss but you can definitely tell that it is a quality shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased Keraplex Organica Shampoo because my hair was thinning around the top of my head. I used the product and even after a few times my hair did seem to be fuller. I would purchase the product again.</li>
    <li> So far I like it.  I have lots of hair problems and one of them is that a lot of hair falls.  When I wake up there is hair in the pillow,  when I shower a lot of hair falls off.  Even just running my fingers through my hair softly.  I think I have noticed some improvement but I don&#x27;t know if its too soon to see results.  I like that it&#x27;s a good size product. It feels good no powerful aroma.  I will continue to test and come back to  add more.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has my hair smoother and it not falling out as much as it was before .i am very happy with this product so far .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and have noticed a difference.  I&#x27;ve noticed less hair in the drain!  Now while I can&#x27;t tell yet if my hair is thicker (as it takes more than 2 weeks for new hair to become more than an inch long lol)  I feel as though it would work.  Just knowing that I&#x27;m loosing less hair makes it worth purchasing this product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing ! I&#x27;ve only been using a short while and already have seen dramatic difference in hair loss in the shower !</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion.  I have tried this shampoo three times now, and I am pleased with the way my hair looks and feels,  It makes my hair fuller and makes it look shiny and healthy.  I also noticed that I didn&#x27;t shed as much hair as usual when washing my hair.  This product does not produce any lather, but I know that this is not important, since it cleans very well.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it contains a few questionable ingredients that I was not expecting by the description of the product.  As other reviewers have mentioned the Methylisothiazolinone  seems to be a preservative that can be a major allergen and maybe not very safe.  I am also somewhat concerned about the PEG 150 and PEG 20, since I have read that they may be toxic.  I did not find any list of ingredients for this shampoo on either Amazon or on the Keraplex site, and did not get the full list of ingredients until I received the product.  Now that I have them I am not sure I will order again even though I like the way it helps my hair.</li>
    <li> Actually suprised with how wonderful this product smells.  I&#x27;ve just been using it for a couple of days and my hair seems to have more volume to it.  This is a huge plus for me since in order to create volume in my hair I need to hairdry which only damages my already thin hair. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Smells good, I suppose its going to be a week or so before it shows up as working. Looks great so far though :)</li>
    <li> Very nice product smells good and hair looks shinny</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel thicker after one use.  Tried other products similar to this one...and this is the best!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> As far as shampoos go this one is excellent.  But with hair loss it really depends on how unclogged your scalp is.  If there is build up on your scalp no shampoo is going to do its job well.  But for most people with DHT issues the buildup IS the problem.  Its better if i wash my hair everyday.  I have to take pills and a combo of both is hardly enough to stop the fallout but it will ease it after sometime and some hair does regrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some supplements and shampoos help and the better the delivery system of the blockers the more it can get into where it needs to go.  This shampoo leaves no buildup where is other products may.  There are many natural shampoos that do the same job, but this one has some key ingredients that can help.  The more i shampoo (daily) the better it is but it also increases the oiliness so its difficult to balance.  Anyway i think the ingredients in this shampoo can really be useful in both breaking up buildup and fighting hair loss.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning for the past year, and this shampoo helped a lot, I stopped noticing strains and strains of hair on my pillow when I woke up and washing my hair is not as scary anymore. I don&#x27;t think I notice a fuller hair but I definitely noticed a reduction in hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for two weeks and love it.  It smells great and makes my hair look fuller.</li>
    <li> Packaging was great, I was excited to try it and check if it works. It smells great, you just need little and it goes a long way. After shower, my hair feels smooth...and after a couple of application...I can notice changes on my hair. Keeps my crowning glory awesome.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this shampoo because as I have gotten older I&#x27;ve noticed I have started losing hair and it&#x27;s becoming more sparse.I though I would give this shampoo a try and see if I was able to see any results.Well,I can say that I noticed a significant difference in the volume of my hair after using this product for just a little while.It seems fuller and is healthier also.I really love the smell of this shampoo,it is a fresh smell that makes you look forward to using it.This is definitely a high quality shampoo! You get what you pay for,quality,great scent and results! I feel good about recommending this shampoo because I know it really works!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own.</li>
    <li> My brother is using daily! He is happy with it but hoping more hair will grow with more time! it has a good smell and it lathers well! after thirty days i will come  back in and show growth.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite new product, and will be a continual part of my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for the last three shampoos, and my hair looks amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4&#x27;stars because I&#x27;ve only had it for a week so I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with hair loss so far. BUT, I&#x27;m honestly loving it so far. It smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling really really soft. I have natural curly hair and I feel like it&#x27;s really tamed the frizziness. I find it hard to work up a good lather, but please keep in mind that my hair is extremely long. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5 and it&#x27;s more than halfway down my back. I&#x27;m excited for the results. I will come back in 2 weeks to leave an updated review.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair loss shampoo! When I read on the listing that it was free of sulfates and parabens, I was immediately intrigued. I&#x27;m completely averted to sulfates and parabens, so although I wasn&#x27;t purchasing this for myself I couldn&#x27;t even gift it if it contained them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend suffers from hair loss, so I bought this for him in hopes that it would help him. My hair type doesn&#x27;t pair well with keratin, but he has had much success with it in his slightly wavy hair. After using this shampoo a few times, his hair does appear a bit fuller and definitely of a more shiny silky texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He hasn&#x27;t had as much hair in the drain, so I definitely believe it&#x27;s working! The smell is very pleasant too. It reminds me of T-Gel, which is what he usually uses to test his scalp dermatitis. I&#x27;ve also noticed that his scalp dermatitis has improved significantly since he started using keraplex! I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality and how well it seems to be working. I would definitely buy again. (I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo for 1 week now and have noticed less hair loss. The shampoo smells great, lathers well and a little goes a long way. Great product!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY if you have sensative skin..made my scalp itch..threw it away....</li>
    <li> I have had this product for over six weeks. Amazing difference. My hair is much thicker and lush. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells really good! Still have to wait to see the results it it definitely wont make your hair condition any worse</li>
    <li> Its fine for shampoo but idk about for&lt;br /&gt;Thinning hair  i have no difference</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing some fairly alarming hair loss which can be attributed to a variety of causes both medical (hormonal imbalance and vitamin deficiency) and emotional (stress and grief). For months, I&#x27;ve noticed thinning at the temples and have been looking for a solution. Having read the reviews, I am hoping that Keraplex will assist in preventing further hair loss. I received the shampoo recently and have already tried it--it smells amazing and leaves my hair clean and fuller-looking. Only time will tell if the product lives up to its promises but I&#x27;m planning on giving it at least 3 - 6 months.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really lather well. I did like that it is made with natural ingredients, didn&#x27;t smell bad but wasn&#x27;t what I expected for how much I paid and didn&#x27;t notice any hair growth.</li>
    <li> where I can find the Keraplex conditioner?</li>
    <li> So far the shampoo works great, cleans, and leaves hair feeling full. I&#x27;m still waiting to see if what is claimed that hair will start growing back  after being used for a period of especially for the cost.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shampoo. Best choice!</li>
    <li> I am only noticing very minimal hair growth so would not whole-heartedly recommend it.  There was an offer to receive an extra free bottle but I keep receiving requests from them to post an online review even though I told them I had not had a chance to finish this second free bottle yet.  Not sure if after the second bottle there will be an improvement but if so will make another post.  So far can&#x27;t tell much of a difference for myself though it may work for others.</li>
    <li> Just used this product for 2 days now. I have a very long hair, waist length &amp; hair loss is one my problems due to damaged done from constant styling &amp; hair color. I like this product, hair feels great after shower, no strong odor. Looking forward to a decreased hair loss with continued use.</li>
    <li> After 2 months, I can honestly say that initially I LOST more hair after using it. Although it provides volume, this is no Rogaine. The acid in the shampoo also stings the eyes but the main reason for the lone star is that it simply did not prevent hair loss. It may work for some people but it sadly did not for me. Very disappointed for buying into the fake reviews.</li>
    <li> One of the greatest shampoes I ever used! I noticed new tiny hair on my scalp after a few uses. Gives also nice silky feel and volume.&lt;br /&gt;Completly satisfied 5*</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband. He used it right after it arrived and was very satisfied with how his hair felt afterward. It is too soon to tell how it does with hair loss but, just like the other reviewers stated, it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I love the way it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  Great Product!!</li>
    <li> Natural and organic with no harsh chemicals is what I love about this shampoo. I&#x27;m using it for slight hair loss and dry scalp.  I love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Keraplex Organica for several months and it really has made a difference in the shine, thickness and overall health of my hair and scalp. I have used other similar products, but I must say that Keraplex Organica is the winner!</li>
    <li> I have tried this shampoo several times now, and I am pleased that my hair seems to fall less. The only con I have is that it doesn&#x27;t make good lather for my long hair and I have to use more of it than I use with other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Keraplex Shampoo for a few weeks now.  I&#x27;ve noticed it makes my hair really soft and frizzless.... seems to feel thicker. I&#x27;ve also noticed its keeping my color in longer, so thats a plus.  Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> The bottle is a bit smaller than I&#x27;d prefer since I like to really lather my hair up... but it&#x27;s a good Shampoo. It has a nice smell and texture. I&#x27;m obsessed with making my hair thicker even though I don&#x27;t have abnormal hair loss so I was excited to start trying this.</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for a great shampoo as I have sensitve skin, fine hair, and tend to have itchy scalp and problems with comrecial products strip my hair and make it feel like straw.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shampoo for a few days now, and have to say I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite diffrent from other products i have tried... it looks a bit like wet mud ..has a plesant smell ...and the lather is on the weak side.&lt;br /&gt;It has worked wonders on my hair so far ! I love how it leaves your hair clean and super soft and managable without stripping or overdrying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that less hair is shedding when i brush it, and my hair is not getting oily as it does with other products. I think i will need to use it longer to say if i am getting more hair growth.I like it so much I have recomended it to several friends and family members.&lt;br /&gt;I think i will be trying the conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;Super happy customer here.</li>
    <li> I had a couple of surgeries really close together and my hair started falling out by the handfuls. It is incredibly worrisome to see all of your hair coming out and knowing it can&#x27;t grow back in fast enough to replace it or even know if it is growing back in. I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to tell you if my hair is growing back in or not yet but I can tell you about the shampoo and update when I can tell you. The things I did not like about this shampoo is that it does not lather well so I felt I needed more shampoo. This could just be my own fault though and if I had known about it not lathering in the product description maybe I would have not felt the need to use extra. It did make my hair soft and shiny and smells very good. It is a brown color as well which surprised me a little so just know when you get it. It appears to be a quality thin hair shampoo.  I will update with my thoughts when I have used it a little more.  I did receive this product for free or reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion as seen above.</li>
    <li> i love it.. i tried it it has a nice smell to it and im hoping to see real great results soon!!!!</li>
    <li> i’ve used it a couple of times already and while it’s too soon to see if it works, the smell and lather is great and comparable to the top brands so I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t know if this helps regrow hair, but it does help with shedding I really like the way this shampoo leaves my hair! It is so full and not weighed down at all. It also has a wonderful fresh scent</li>
    <li> Pros: This shampoo has some great ingredients that are key to healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a slight orange red color and has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They recommend for best effects to leave it on for at least 2 mins before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con: It does not sud nearly as much as normal shampoo. Makes it difficult to actually use it as a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick greasy hair that I have to wash everyday so i&#x27;ve been washing with my normal shampoo and then using this as a pre-conditioner soak to get the argan oil and keratin benefits.</li>
    <li> The shampoo smells lovely and lathers very quickly with a rich lather. This coupon is so confident you will like this product and see results, it comes with a coupon for a free bottle that includes shipping. That alone let me know their serious about their product. Thus far I like this shampoo and it gives my hair more body and better texture, I would awesome its from the keratin oil.</li>
    <li> I am not sure I can describe exactly how this makes my head feel. The first wash was amazing, it was like my roots were just drenched in caffeine. It would be crazy to say i feel my hair growing, or even hear the hairs grow, but it is close.</li>
    <li> Its great shampoo.  I think it made my hair look a little bit fuller and more healthier looking.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling product, however doesn&#x27;t lather at all.  I was told this shampoo wouldn&#x27;t lather like other shampoos with sulfates, etc. in them, but I have to really work it thru my hair to get any suds at all.  Having said that, my hair does appear clean and shiny after I use this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for only two weeks.  I was told by the Mars Laboratories shortly after purchase that this shampoo does not lather, so I knew what to expect.  It seems that I need to use more of the product because it doesn&#x27;t lather; however, it seems to clean my hair &amp; scalp adequately.  It was advertised to be a DHT blocking shampoo, so I purchased it to help thinning hair &amp; hair loss.  I imagine if it helps with this issue, results will hopefully be visible in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has helped prevent further thinning of hair. I will definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my hair on top is getting really thin and losing quite a bit of hair every time I shampoo in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;With this product, it seems like I&#x27;m losing less hair loss when shampooing, but it leaves my hair feeling quite coarse.  I know that there is a conditioner of this product, but cannot find it anywhere, although the Mars site does show it.&lt;br /&gt;So, I have to use my other conditioner product along with this, so am probably not getting the full benefit that could be had by using both the Keraplex shampoo and Keraplex conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this product about 4 times, and so far am pleased with less hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> Been using for two months now. Not sure if it helps with hair loss or not but my hair feels healthy and smells great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff you see  immediate results in fullnes after shampooing.  Strongly recommend I will continue using this as my everyday shampoo. I&#x27;m convinced.</li>
    <li> Your product has given my hair more body and shine than any other shampoo that I have used in the past,and believe me I have used quite a few.I am looking forward to using your product continually to promote a healthy scalp and promote hair growth.The product despite the absence of SLS ,lathers remarkably well,and has a pleasant fragrance</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems to be working. I&#x27;ve only used about 3/4 of the bottle, but I do notice that my hair seems fuller and healthier. There is definitely less hair loss with shampooing, so over time I expect my hair will become thicker and thicker. Also, smell is really nice, and it leaves my hair very manageable. Definitely plan to continue with it.</li>
    <li> I gave this shampoo a shot for about three weeks. Unfortunately it leaves my hair feeling dry and brittle. As others have mentioned, it smells great but does not create much of a lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like the bulk of these reviewers state getting a free product. I wonder how many of these positive reviews are legit and not paid for?</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a change in my hair..</li>
    <li> After the pregnancy, I&#x27;ve lost the volume to my air. After using this shampoo for a week, I noticed remarkable changes in the volume of my hair, especially in the from where it looked flat. My hair has become fuller, and nearly returned to its pre-pregnancy condition. A very nice shampoo.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with this product&#x27;s performance and how his hair feels....if he slows down on the hair loss, he will be a user for life!!!</li>
    <li> I really like what this product smells like and feels like in my hair. Followed by conditioner, it leaves my hair super soft and clean. In terms of its ability to make hair fuller and thicker, I have noticed that I am loosing less hair, although I haven&#x27;t noticed that my hair looks any less thin. I have used one whole bottle thus far and will probably continue to use this product because it doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals, etc.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.. It leaves my hair so soft and smooth and you do not have to use a conditioner with this.. I love the scent as well.. This shampoo is like the wen shampoo and you do not get lots of soap that strips your hair of all its nutrients..as for hair loss..I have not used it long enough to notice a difference on that .. but as far as a great shampoo..I give it 5 stars.. Thank you keraplex..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. The first thing I noticed was the scent, I expected it to have an unpleasant smell and it does not! It smells great. I have noticed my hair has way more volume than usual. There is no leftover residue, leaves your hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a consistent month and a half. While I have not noticed any hair regrowth, it does not look any thinner and I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have as much hair collecting in the shower drain. I will continue to use this to see if additional results are had.</li>
    <li> I am giving this shampoo 5 stars because as far as shampoo goes this is a terrific one it smells great leaves your hair manageable it&#x27;s not the best cosmetic shampoo for thin balding hair but does thicken and volume it seems to strengthen your hair that&#x27;s the best thing about this shampoo witch yields less hair loss as for hair growth maybe to soon and I am a little skeptical because this product has a paper label slapped over the original label ingredients and the paper label does not include the best ingredient in this shampoo it and without the procylin b2 on this shampoo the ingredient that is left off it makes this just a great shampoo not a big time hair loss hair growth shampoo I wrote the company witch insist that it was a printing mistake and says be reassured all of our bottles of there shampoo have procyadin b2 in them . my problem that I am wondering is why put a paper label over the list of ingredients anyway if not for the very reason to change the ingredients that were originally supposed to be in it I have recieved 2 bottles sence then both with the paper label and both without that ingredient regardless for 19 this shampoo is a must try compared to other hair loss shampoos that in cases will just make your hair fallout even more also the customer service with this company&#x27;s shampoo is fantastic better than most any you will find unless of coarse they are lying to everyone and ripping us off with false ingredients advertising</li>
    <li> I am a 40 something with thin hair all my life, and it &#x27;s getting thinner recently. So I have been trying to find a real solution for my hair problem. Then I found Keraplex, I liked the idea that I can have the volume and the organic ingredients at the same time. SO I tried it for a few weeks, and I like the result very much, my hair is gaining the volume for real. I love it.</li>
    <li> I loved the way this made my hair feel. It gave it body and also emphasized the wave in my hair. It is not at all sudsy. This is hard to get used to for me. I liked the results, it is worth it to keep trying it to see how it performs over time.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, so any time I get stressed or something occurs to make my hair shed my hair starts to look ragged.  I&#x27;m also in the gray stage so coloring is a must - and that sure doesn&#x27;t help!  I&#x27;ve had to keep my hair shoulder length or shorter for years, otherwise my tips look frayed and horribly thin.  Keraplex actually helps keep my hair full looking and healthy - I&#x27;m even able to grow my hair longer!  Even during the dreaded time when my hair falls out more then normal it still looks full!  If you have fine hair like mine you&#x27;ll understand just how much this means!  Please be aware, it is brown.  So don&#x27;t be surprised when you squirt it out for the first time!  :-)</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks and I realize you need to use a product like this for longer to know the true results.  However, I usually have a good idea after a couple of weeks as to whether or not a product is worth continuing and this one definitely is.  I am post menopausal and like all the women in my family, I have thinning hair.  With this shampoo I am seeing less fallout in the shower and during combing.  The shampoo does smell great however it does not have great lather so that took some getting used to.  I think a good point to note is that the bottle does tell you to leave the shampoo on for two minutes to allow it soak in to your scalp so you actually get the benefits from the product.</li>
    <li> So good!! It smells great, and doesn&#x27;t have all the bad chemicals in it. Works for colored hair like mine. My hair  feels great!</li>
    <li> I have very thin, damaged hair and have tried everything to make it look full.  This Shampoo really works!  I used it with my regular Conditioner, and followed the instructions (wait two minutes before rinsing) and have seen results.  My hair looks and feels fuller and thicker with only one week of everyday use.  I like that it smells great and it&#x27;s not tested on animals.  I will buy another bottle once this one gets low!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Keraplex Organica Shampoo for Hair Loss Prevention for about 2 weeks.  Surprisingly, I&#x27;m getting a noticeable layer of regrowth already.  My hair has always be thin and not much of it, but since my cancer surgery, it&#x27;s been falling out faster.  Kearaplex is doing the job.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this! I have thick hair but I get like a handful falling out at every shower. Since using this about a week now, I have noticed less hair falling out, also, my hair seems to not get greasy so quickly which is an added bonus!!! I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN RETURN FOR AN HONEST REVIEW, THE REVIEW IS MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION.</li>
    <li> I received my order very quickly. I am pleased so far with this product. I am sure with continued use I will see improvement&lt;br /&gt;In my hair. Thanks Susan M</li>
    <li> My daughter has thinning edges. And this has helped a lot. We have used for two weeks now. I will use longer and update my review. The smell is awesome as well it lathers great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo a little over a week and I have already noticed a difference. I am losing a lot of hair after giving birth to my son 4 months ago and after using the shampoo it has cut the hair loss in half! It also smells great and my hair looks and feels so clean!</li>
    <li> It smells good but I can not tell results yet</li>
    <li> The reason I am rating this otherwise very high quality Keraplex Organica Shampoo for Hair Loss Prevention a 4-Star rating is that it does contain the preservative \\&quot;Methylisothiazoline\\&quot; (to which I am highly allergic). If it had been stated in the product description as being one of the ingredients, I would not have ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, many, many shampoos, conditioners, skin products, liquid hand soaps, and even baby products do contain \\&quot;Methylisothiazoline\\&quot; ... It&#x27;s so hard to find beauty and personal care products that do NOT use this well-known allergen as a preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps when enough people realize that the annoying itchiness and often more serious skin and scalp symptoms they experience is due to the added preservative \\&quot;Methylisothiazoline\\&quot; (which also causes similar symptoms in other parts of the body as well) ... more companies and their manufacturers will stop using this particular allergen as the product&#x27;s preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I passed this shampoo on to a relative who was able to use it, not being allergic to \\&quot;Methylisothiazoline\\&quot; ... She found it to be of very high quality and effective, making her hair feel fuller and shiny. She was very pleased to be given it to try and liked it very much and said she would definitely continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have only used Keraplex for a week, but I&#x27;m already noticing that my hair is shiner and has better volume.  A coworker actually commented how good my hair has looked this week. I would recommend giving Keraplex a try.  I&#x27;ve tried many others and seen very little results.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful!  I have very fine hair and this product makes my hair appear fuller and more shiny.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo.... works great on my hair</li>
    <li> I have had a problem with hair loss ever since I gave birth to my twins a couple of years ago, and have tried a couple of different hair loss shampoos, but none of them really seemed to work. After the first wash I could tell that it left my hair looking very shiny and soft. I received this shampoo in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, and so far I really like it. I really like the smell, and how well it lathered up. It also was really easy to rinse out of my hair, and I have really long hair that is sometimes hard to get all the shampoo out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this stop hair loss shampoo for about a week, and my hair is noticeably fuller. I had lost a lot of hair and it was beginning to become really noticeable, especially around my face and behind my bangs. My hair has always been so thick and full that you couldn&#x27;t see my scalp at all. For the past couple of years, though, you could see my scalp behind my temples and bangs, and I looked like a man with thinning hair. It was very uncomfortable, to say the least! Now I am not as self conscious about it, and I can even pull it back without worrying about the hair loss being made more noticeable. My hair is beginning to look normal again!</li>
    <li> Ok. so I don&#x27;t know if it really helps with thinning because I have only used it three times. I would need to use it for a little over a month to really see results on that. But I did notice more volume in my hair after each use. The first time I used it, my hair felt clean and soft. But the second time I used it, I did a pre-poo treatment before using it because that what I do in my normal routine, and I want to see if it made a difference. It worked amazingly well with other products and I cant describe how manageable and soft my curls were. This shampoo  is a &amp;#34;low suds&amp;#34; shampoo. You wont get a lot of lather but your hair will be thoroughly cleansed. I was pleased with the shampoo because it was very comparable (in consistency, lather, and cleansing capabilities) to the more natural shampoos I usually buy. Like I said, it did help tremendously with volume but I think I may need to pick up the correlating conditioner, and use them both constantly to see if it helps with hair loss as well.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot it is very affective, did make my hair stronger, and shinier, you use a little pit and it will be enough amount to lather all over your hair, I noticed less breakage in my hair ends. I wished it comes in a bigger portion. thank you for letting me try your product for little money</li>
