      <li>A great price.</li>
      <li>Good quality eye liner.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s definitely a good investment.</li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>The color is nice--</li>
      <li>Nice color and stays on until I take it off.  </li>
      <li>It is a very fair price for good quality makeup and I love that it twists up and never needs to be sharpened (this causes no waste!).</li>
      <li>I have been searching for an eyeliner that will stay put that is easy to apply and remove, this is the one!  </li>
      <li>Would have liked a finer, more continuous line, but I really love this product.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth, and is can be smudged before setting.</li>
      <li>I will continue to look for a better waterproof eyeliner, which most that say they are, are not; but will use this one until I find one I like better.  </li>
      <li>I love Avon.</li>
      <li>They used to be waterproof but not any more.</li>
      <li>So glad I found this add-on offering in Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I should have brought more.  </li>
      <li>love it.  </li>
      <li>Most pencil liners I&#x27;ve tried tend to melt and run so that I look like a raccon by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>my favorite eyeliner type</li>
      <li>simply love this eyeliner, affordable too.</li>
      <li>I heart you Avon :)</li>
      <li>I love Avon Glimmersticks Eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>Nice color, though nothing special.  </li>
      <li>This one goes on easy, stays put, and doesn&#x27;t require the removal of skin to clean it off - always a plus!  :)</li>
      <li>Very affordable, easy to apply, lasts well, looks good, will buy more.</li>
      <li>I love them because they glide on easily and are easy to stick in my purse for touchups.  </li>
      <li>I have dark brown eyes and very fair skin and this eyeliner looks amazing on me.  </li>
      <li>Works just as good as high end eye liner pencils for just a fraction of the cost!  </li>
      <li>It washes off easily and leaves no smudges in the day time.</li>
      <li>The eyeliner is waterproof yet removes easily with eye makeup remover and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>I love the color of this eyeliner, it&#x27;s a very nice brown, not too dark or too light, kind of like the color of milk chocolate.</li>
      <li>The best dark brown I have found yet is by Maybeline and they have decided to discontintue it.</li>
      <li>This one goes on easily and smoothly and stays on until I remove it.</li>
      <li>It does have great lasting power though.</li>
      <li>This eye liner goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s soft for easy application and coverage.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner goes on smoothly, it is creamy and a deep rich color.</li>
      <li>Have been using Glimmersticks for years and love them; but my Avon lady quit the business several months ago and couldn&#x27;t find anyone else</li>
      <li>make sure you keep covered or they will dry out</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, looks good, and it&#x27;s not too expensive.  </li>
      <li>normally use Cosmic Brown-- Chocolate brown is a softer, lighter shade (seriously, it&#x27;s the color of a chocolate bar), and while I prefer Cosmic Brown, which is more black/brown, I was pleased with the price and the delivery from the seller.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would recommend this item to a friend thanks</li>
      <li>Other eyeliner pencils I&#x27;ve tried have either been easy to apply but rubbed right off</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a darker brown - this is more like &amp;#34;watered down Coke&amp;#34; than chocolate brown.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried eye liner in many different forms and brands, but Avon Glimmersticks is the only one I truly like.  </li>
      <li>I HAVE USED IT MANY TIMES IN THE PAST.  </li>
      <li>Get the Neutrogena Nurishing eyeliner, it&#x27;s less expensive AND has one of the best built in smudgers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I like black for my eye liner originally, but when I saw the brown-</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive eyes, I would not recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get why so many brown brow pencils have a heavy tint of red in them.  </li>
      <li>Really like this for long wear.</li>
      <li>It turns the entire white of my eye a light shade of pink.</li>
      <li>The pink stayed for a whole day after I took it off.</li>
      <li>I wore it a few times to confirm that it was really the eyeliner that was causing the freaky pink eyes, but it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>I am not a dark headed red head!!!  </li>
      <li>I would really like to find a dark gray.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really sure why it&#x27;s called glimmerstick though, since it doesn&#x27;t have even a hint of glitter in it, which is fine with me, since I&#x27;m not really into glitter.</li>
      <li>I rated it high because it is waterproof, but it is difficult to apply and is very light needing careful reapplication.  </li>
      <li>Soft and long lasting.</li>

<li> Soft and long lasting.</li>
<li> Nothing special and no more staying power than other eye pencils, however.</li>
<li> Hard to find this cool, dark brown at the drugstore price.</li>
<li> it stays in place for my long hours at work without touch up or reapplication.  </li>
<li> After trying multiple other brands, I tried this eyeliner and am hooked.</li>
<li> black is for when you go clubbing and such.</li>
<li> The chocolate brown isn&#x27;t very dark, but would definitely buy it again but in a darker color.</li>
<li> I EXPECTED IT TO BE.  </li>
<li> It arrived as expected.</li>
<li> other days where I do not.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know why I even bother to try other brands that always disappoint.  </li>
<li> On top of everything the crap smudges like a mother.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just like every other liner that runs by end of day!</li>
<li> If you do in that case... go with the black.</li>
<li> so I was a little concerned about the sterility of it, but took the risk and used it without any eye infection.  </li>
<li> This is not a smooth eye liner, seems &#x27;waxy.&#x27;  </li>
<li> It lasts almost all day usually unless I keep rubbing my eyes.</li>
<li> Little hard to put on but does the job!</li>
<li> it came a day late</li>
<li> seller was ridiculous.</li>
<li> Not a happy customer I would say.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t itch, and I didn&#x27;t scratch at them, but it gets worse the longer you wear it.</li>
<li> or if they had staying power were difficult to apply.</li>
<li> Absolutely absurd!</li>
<li> DOESN&#x27;T RUN AS BAD.</li>

    <li> Good quality eye liner.</li>
    <li> I bought this off amazon because it is constantly on backorder through Avon. It arrived as expected. It is the only eyeliner that does not irritate my eyes. It lasts almost all day usually unless I keep rubbing my eyes. It is a very fair price for good quality makeup and I love that it twists up and never needs to be sharpened (this causes no waste!). I heart you Avon :)</li>
    <li> This product is great for when I&#x27;m on the go.&lt;br /&gt;I never have to stop to sharpen the pencil and it&#x27;s soft for easy application and coverage.</li>
    <li> nice!! make sure you keep covered or they will dry out</li>
    <li> Even thru a spin class  still stays in place.  No running or smearing.  A great espresso brown. A great price.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works just as good as high end eye liner pencils for just a fraction of the cost!  Would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Was looking for this item and found on  Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Liked the product&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this item to a friend thanks</li>
    <li> I love it! Doesn&#x27;t smear like the store boughten stuff I had.... 👍 I&#x27;d definately would recommend it to female who wears makeup!</li>
    <li> This eye liner goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t smudge.  I don&#x27;t know why I even bother to try other brands that always disappoint.  This is the best pencil liner.</li>
    <li> Have been using Glimmersticks for years and love them; but my Avon lady quit the business several months ago and couldn&#x27;t find anyone else so was really happy to find it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use Cosmic Brown-- Chocolate brown is a softer, lighter shade (seriously, it&#x27;s the color of a chocolate bar), and while I prefer Cosmic Brown, which is more black/brown, I was pleased with the price and the delivery from the seller. The eyeliner is waterproof yet removes easily with eye makeup remover and lasts all day.  And I especially love the fact that this is a twist-up pencil-- no sharpener needed.  I use eyeliner every day and one pencil will last for 3 months so it&#x27;s definitely a good investment.</li>
    <li> After trying multiple other brands, I tried this eyeliner and am hooked. Easy to apply, looks beautiful and lasts all day without a touch up.</li>
    <li> I rated it high because it is waterproof, but it is difficult to apply and is very light needing careful reapplication.  I will continue to look for a better waterproof eyeliner, which most that say they are, are not; but will use this one until I find one I like better.  Also, it came without any plastic covering or box so I was a little concerned about the sterility of it, but took the risk and used it without any eye infection.  It was a risk however.  I would recommend that Avon put this in a sealed wrapper.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED ON TIME.  NO CONTACT WITH SELLER.  PRODUCT WAS&lt;br /&gt;THE WAY I EXPECTED IT TO BE.  I HAVE USED IT MANY TIMES IN THE PAST.  BETTER&lt;br /&gt;THAN COVERGIRL OR LOREAL&#x27;.  DOESN&#x27;T RUN AS BAD.</li>
    <li> With a name like glimmersticks, I was expecting a shimmery brown eyeliner, but it is a matte finish on. It does have great lasting power though.</li>
    <li> This is not a smooth eye liner, seems &#x27;waxy.&#x27;  It does not apply without a lot of tugging and pulling. I won&#x27;t be using it.</li>
    <li> Really like this for long wear. The chocolate brown isn&#x27;t very dark, but would definitely buy it again but in a darker color. I would really like to find a dark gray.</li>
    <li> These eyeliners are the best.</li>
    <li> One of the best pencils.</li>
    <li> Little hard to put on but does the job!</li>
    <li> I used it.  The tip keeps snapping off.  Not a happy customer I would say.  Still looking for a reliable eye liner that doesnt snap off.</li>
    <li> Again, another winner for AVON.  simply love this eyeliner, affordable too. It washes off easily and leaves no smudges in the day time.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for an eyeliner that will stay put that is easy to apply and remove, this is the one!  I don&#x27;t do well with liquid liners and prefer pencils. Most pencil liners I&#x27;ve tried tend to melt and run so that I look like a raccon by the end of the day. This one goes on easy, stays put, and doesn&#x27;t require the removal of skin to clean it off - always a plus!  :)</li>
    <li> Great pencil.  Soft and long lasting. Would have liked a finer, more continuous line, but I really love this product. Doesn&#x27;t bother my contacts or flake off.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown eyes and very fair skin and this eyeliner looks amazing on me.  The color is nice-- it stays in place for my long hours at work without touch up or reapplication.  I pair this with &amp;#34;REVLON Colorstay 16 Hour Eye Shadow Quad, Addictive&amp;#34; and can go for 12+ hours without worrying that I don&#x27;t have time to fuss about my make up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get why so many brown brow pencils have a heavy tint of red in them.  This is unusable do to the red tint.  I am not a dark headed red head!!!  The best dark brown I have found yet is by Maybeline and they have decided to discontintue it. Grrr.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a darker brown - this is more like &amp;#34;watered down Coke&amp;#34; than chocolate brown. Next time I&#x27;ll choose a name that implies something darker.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on like it says.  It&#x27;s just like every other liner that runs by end of day!</li>
    <li> Nice color, though nothing special.  Hard to find this cool, dark brown at the drugstore price. Nothing special and no more staying power than other eye pencils, however.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this eyeliner, it&#x27;s a very nice brown, not too dark or too light, kind of like the color of milk chocolate. It goes on very smooth, and is can be smudged before setting. I&#x27;m not really sure why it&#x27;s called glimmerstick though, since it doesn&#x27;t have even a hint of glitter in it, which is fine with me, since I&#x27;m not really into glitter.</li>
    <li> Other eyeliner pencils I&#x27;ve tried have either been easy to apply but rubbed right off or if they had staying power were difficult to apply. This one goes on easily and smoothly and stays on until I remove it. The color is an ideal black-brown.</li>
    <li> I love Avon Glimmersticks Eyeliner.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, looks good, and it&#x27;s not too expensive.  It&#x27;s great to get this from Amazon too!</li>
    <li> So glad I found this add-on offering in Amazon.  Very affordable, easy to apply, lasts well, looks good, will buy more.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to get here! They used to be waterproof but not any more.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on smoothly, it is creamy and a deep rich color. However, as gorgeous as it looks it is unusable.  It turns the entire white of my eye a light shade of pink. It doesn&#x27;t itch, and I didn&#x27;t scratch at them, but it gets worse the longer you wear it. I wore it a few times to confirm that it was really the eyeliner that was causing the freaky pink eyes, but it just isn&#x27;t worth it. The pink stayed for a whole day after I took it off. If you have sensitive eyes, I would not recommend this product.  My eyes have never reacted to an eyeliner before, but this one definitely affects them.</li>
    <li> love it.  I should have brought more.  I will be ordering another one will soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried eye liner in many different forms and brands, but Avon Glimmersticks is the only one I truly like.  I like that I can get them here at a great price anytime I want instead of waiting for a sale with Avon.</li>
    <li> my favorite eyeliner type</li>
    <li> Nice color and stays on until I take it off.  Definitely need make-up remover - which is how I like it.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I like black for my eye liner originally, but when I saw the brown- I like it because it goes well with my brown mascara. They go well together if you do not want to stand out with lots of makeup around the eyes. If you do in that case... go with the black. I like to have my days where I want to stand out and other days where I do not. brown is great for those days when you want to go to the bank or even pay bills. black is for when you go clubbing and such.</li>
    <li> Thumbs up all the way.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and I like it a lot -altough it came a day late that was O.K.</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003V5ARX6/ref&#x3D;asc_df_B003V5ARX62536263?smid&#x3D;A3FS9NIZQK3S0U&amp;tag&#x3D;dealtmp764884-20&amp;linkCode&#x3D;asn&amp;creative&#x3D;395105&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B003V5ARX6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller was ridiculous. Made you wait 2 weeks for fulfillment (THEN 5-7 days shipping even as a Prime member) and when I tried to cancel my order they would not accept that I didn&#x27;t want it. Said they send it (still 5-7 days shipping) and give me 20% off. Absolutely absurd! On top of everything the crap smudges like a mother. Get the Neutrogena Nurishing eyeliner, it&#x27;s less expensive AND has one of the best built in smudgers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering Glimmersticks ever since they came on the market years ago.  I love them because they glide on easily and are easy to stick in my purse for touchups.  I love Avon.</li>
