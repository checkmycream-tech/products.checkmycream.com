    <li> This works great. It&#x27;s the only product I like. It keeps it&#x27;s glide and it&#x27;s not too thin. Simply the best</li>
    <li> great stuff, fast deliveery</li>
    <li> I have looked for a non-greasy massage gel for years. It had to be slippery, yet not oily,&lt;br /&gt;and washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it. The best</li>
    <li> Yes, I like the Biotone Advanced Therapy Lotion.  It hydrates the skin, without being oily, but slippery enough for massaging.  Has no sent, another plus.</li>
    <li> Great medium for massage without the greasy feeling and moisturizes your skin at the same time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and would highly recommend it. I can&#x27;t say enough about this lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily as others do.</li>
    <li> The only massage lotion we use, fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> I rally like the product but unless you have a pump cap it is tough to use as may be obvious :)  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> WAY too expensive for the poor quality</li>
    <li> Have used this for many years and it is really great.  It actually soaks in and does not feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been a massage therapist for 25 years wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Since I became acquainted with Biotone lotion when I worked for Massage Envy, it is all I use for my massages.</li>
    <li> I found out about this lotion when I got a massage. It is excellent! It soaks into the skin rather than leaving it oily. With oil, I have to take a shower very soon, or I end up feeling icky/sticky for the rest of the day. We now keep an 8-ounce bottle of this on our nightstand at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the [[ASIN:B0000Y8I78 BIOTONE Advanced Therapy Massage Lotion (8 oz w/ Pump)]] is pretty expensive.  The half-gallon is a about 1/3 the cost.  Refilling the small bottle with this thick lotion is messy.  See my review of the 8-ounce bottle for details.</li>
    <li> This is the best massage lotion on the planet! No sticky mess, No smelly oil, No slime, just nice soothing lotion that actually moisturizes your skin while being massaged. It is very smoothe and does not get dry during the massage. You can actually get dressed after the massage not feeling slimey. Try it and you will never go back to what you were previously using.</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I am an LMT in NYS and use this for almost all my appointments. It works well for both Deep Tissue and Swedish. It is unscented, which is great for sensitive people or for mixing essential oils. Not sticky and not too slippery. Just ordered another one!</li>
    <li> this is my favorite massage lotion. i get compliments on this product regularly, usually for it&#x27;s lack of oily residue or lack of scent. I have skin reactions to harsh lotions (even &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; types from the major brands) and this has never bothered me. I do find that it can clog pores in sensitive areas but that&#x27;s the case with any oil based lotion really.</li>
    <li> Great long lasting and non greasy</li>
