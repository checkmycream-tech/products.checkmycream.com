      <li>(which for me is unusual since I have a lot of purfume allergies).</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>

      <li>Not sure how they could send to me by mail, but now it&#x27;s considered hazardous material</li>
      <li>This is my new go-to perfume!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update love the smell so always spray a little on my hand.</li>
      <li>For what I paid though I got more then I thought it would be, which made me happy, although the shipping was terrible.</li>
      <li>i felt like this one was watered down or something since it wasn&#x27;t much oil at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am so glad i bought this on amazon instead of the department store. I saved a ton of money, and instead of just getting the perfume bottle alone, I got the body wash and lotion, and paid less !!!  I totally recommend this.  It is also the larger or regular sized bottle and not a smaller one included int eh package set. awesome!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price. Just the perfume alone in stores is over 50$, and for 25$ this also comes with lotion and body wash. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Rápida entrega, excelente manejo y embalaje de la mercancía. La fragancia como tal es exquisita, ampliamente recomendado. Vendedor serio, responsable y dedicado.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume every since my sister had it i knew I had to get it for myself definitely the perfect choice when your around your boyfriend to entice him..... the packaging was perfect and came with the body lotion/shower gel and the perfume bottle which i might say is huge.... exceeded my expectations I will definitely buy from the seller again. the price for this product was a bet!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fancy is one of my favorite celebrity scents, and this set was very economical. It would make a welcome gift for any Fancy-lover you know.</li>
    <li> If you love fancy this is a great set. The body gel lathers well with a sponge or poof but not with a regular wash cloth. The scent is a perfect match to the perfume so it works well to layer. The lotion is slightly less impressive having a bit of a plastic smell to it that turns me off. Otherwise its a great set &amp; the price CANNOT be beat. It retails for fifty nine at department stores so twenty five is a steal! Stinky lotion &amp; all.</li>
    <li> I first learned of this smell while in Jaimaca.  A friend&#x27;s roommate had it...and every chance I got, I was in their spraying some on!  I know, bad girl!  But love the smell.  I&#x27;m fancy now! :0)</li>
    <li> Very Good Item, the price is really good and item is very nice, is a very good gift for someone special</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas Gift for my daughter who said this scent is the best she has smelled in years.  This coming from a Gucci girl....Cant wait to give it to her!  Dont hesitate, grea gift at a great price!</li>
    <li> i bought this same one in the mall long ago and i loved how it smelled so i bought another one after i finished with it and got this one. i felt like this one was watered down or something since it wasn&#x27;t much oil at all. wasnt pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is my new go-to perfume! I am absolutely in love with this smell! It is very sweet smelling, sexy and feminine. It smells like vanilla cupcakes. Also, you don&#x27;t need to spray a lot. The smell lasts all day. When I wear it I can&#x27;t stop smelling myself--and the price is awesome for how much perfume you get!!! I am not that impressed with the lotion--it has a weird artificial smell to it. But the shower gel is great--smells just like the perfume. Also, the shipping is fast! I will definately buy again!</li>
    <li> I saw this purfume at the department store and really liked it!!! (which for me is unusual since I have a lot of purfume allergies). So I decided to see if it might be on Amazon for cheaper, and it was! Plus it came as a set...which I love...but the only thing is I think the hand lotion is \\&quot;defective\\&quot; or something because it smells odd; that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5. But I love the purfume and body wash!!!</li>
    <li> smells great like a creamy vanilla love it. one spray will do. ordered directly from amazon and it came in less than one day. was not expecting it. i have two sisters and they each got fancy for their birthday they love it as i do also. the picture shows shower gel but i got an EDP roller instead, glad they gave me the roller. much rather have that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update love the smell so always spray a little on my hand. Took a long shower and not as strong of course but still lingering.</li>
    <li> never could find a better deal for this, thanks amazon!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is the same, but I specifically ordered this set to have the body wash, body lotion, and perfume. Instead I received a body lotion, perfume, and a smaller perfume for a purse. Best part is you cannot even return it. Even better, Amazon sold it to me. I posted a video review which was correct in every aspect for criteria to post a video review and it was taken down. I am going to contact Amazon tomorrow and let them know how disappointed I am. This was already gifted to my mother-in-law who was happy, but didn&#x27;t get what she should have. There is no need for her to have a travel perfume and she is big on body wash... Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have seen this item at other places for much more money. This set is a great value. And I love the pretty, floral, feminine scent.</li>
    <li> This is the wrong perfume and I cannot return it.  This was not known at time of purchase.  Not sure how they could send to me by mail, but now it&#x27;s considered hazardous material and I need to just keep the wrong perfume set.</li>
    <li> This will be the perfect gift for my granddaughter for Christmas. The bottle is much larger than expected.The tubes are good quality.They come in a very nice gift set.The price could not have been better. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a Jessica Simpson gift set.Like i said you can&#x27;t beat the price for this set</li>
    <li> The first time I sprayed this I didn&#x27;t like it. After I wearing this perfume several time I fell in love with it. I love love this perfume, in fact this is my everyday perfume. I use this everyday when I go out. This is actually perfect for fall/winter scent. I tried wearing this around the summer, the smell didn&#x27;t go well with my body chemistry. Overall I love this perfume, I will purchase again once I run out it!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i love the sent of this perfume i bought it for my wife online because she used to were it a long time ago and i love how it smells.</li>
    <li> So, I love the price, i love what I got, it was a great deal.! but I paid almost 10 dollars for shipping, more then overnight, and it took more than a week for it to be sent. I had to email the seller before the product even got shipped. Then when it came the box was cracked and broken. For what I paid though I got more then I thought it would be, which made me happy, although the shipping was terrible. Id say definitley buy it but don&#x27;t expect it for a while.</li>
