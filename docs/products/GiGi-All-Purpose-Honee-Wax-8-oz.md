<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The wax isn&#x27;t horrible but I&#x27;m not that happy with it either.</li>
    <li> This stuff went straight in the bin after waxing my legs. I&#x27;ve been waxing my own legs for most of my adult life and have never used wax as STUPIDLY STICKY as this! Maybe I should have read the fine print, but most wax I have used WASHES out in water eventually. I use Tea Tree oil to wipe down my legs after most waxing sessions and then soap and water. I was swearing and cursing at this stuff! And refused to use a whole bottle of tea tree oil to clean up. I was still sticky after a shower, baby oil &amp; tea tree oil.  If it doesn&#x27;t wash out, what&#x27;s the point? How is that economical if you need to dispose of cloth strips each time? Maybe there&#x27;s a magical product I&#x27;m missing to make this stuff easier to use.. But I&#x27;m never using this again.</li>
    <li> It is very cheap buy it for this way. It is an excellent product. I am from South America, so we wax since we are teenager, and honestly this is excellent quality.</li>
    <li> New to waxing I got this generic wax. Glad I did. I have acne on my face and mild exzema on my legs. I&#x27;ve used it without an issue on my face, underarms and legs. I love it!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I also have the Gigi warmer.  I wax my lower legs and sometimes my bikini area, and it provides long-lasting hair removal of about 7-10 days (vs. shaving 1 day).  Getting my legs waxed at a salon is 5 times more expensive and also takes much more time than doing it myself does.  This pot lasts me about 8 waxes. I use baby oil to remove any wax easily, but cover a small area of where I wax with newspaper for an easy clean-up.</li>
    <li> In love with this wax literally gets all my hair out!!!</li>
    <li> I AM STILL STICKY AFTER 3 SHOWERS THIS WAX STICKS TO EVERYTHING I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AND I AM NOT BUYING ITEM THIS AGAIN</li>
    <li> I like this product for my facial hair because it removes finer hairs very well. I prefer the GiGi hard wax for removing body hair since that hair is alot thicker on me</li>
    <li> I am going to school for cosmetology so we learned how to wax and I loved it so much I thought I would buy everything for home use! This wax gets the job done but I feel that there are better choices out there. This wax smells kind of funky, not bad just odd.. the wax its self works pretty well, the only problem I really have with it is related to ripping it off with the wax strips. It is a soft wax so you need to use the fabric wax strips to remove the wax. Wax strips are expensive and you are suppose to be able to use one strip on about 5 different sections (rips) before throwing the wax strip away. This wax however, does not stick to itself well, meaning that you can only use 1 strip for 2 different rips.. I found it pretty disappointing so I took a star away for what would have been a 5 star product. Also, you are always suppose to use oil or baby powder on your skin before you lay down the wax and the oil didn&#x27;t work as well for me as the baby powder did on this particular product. Other than all that, the wax got the job done, I will probably try a different one next time though.</li>
    <li> This is advertised as all the other &#x27;honee&#x27; waxes are, to be water soluble with easy clean up. well, you need some extra post waxing stuff or you will end up with a sticky film all over yourself. not like other washable honey waxes. still worked good tho.</li>
    <li> I have stubborn thick hair and usually when I get my eyebrows waxed at a salon they always have to go over certain areas or end up plucking my eyebrows even though I pay for a wax. I was a bit nervous at first to wax my own eyebrows but I said what the heck and ended up with wonderful shaped eyebrows. I am so happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this to someone that has thick hair. Its a tad messy but as long as you do not over heat your wax there will not be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note I also bought the GIGI warmer and was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I used it once, it works great, no hairs left behind..but the worst part is its very sticky...I have used other products but never faced such stickiness earlier. Water can&#x27;t work on its stickiness, you need to purchase oil for it. From my side, 3 stars, since it works great on hairs, but yes, I will explore some other product which are less messy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my own legs for years and this stuff does the job. Just wish the \\&quot;new\\&quot; warmer got a little hotter. Thinner the wax, better the pull. Hey, if you are paying someone else to wax your legs, etc, it&#x27;s not that hard and very economical to do it yourself.</li>
    <li> I had previously ordered one &amp; was impressed &amp; hence reordered when i ran out of my previous purchase. The best thing about GIGI All Purpose Honee is that it doesn&#x27;t sugar up after heating up a few times like other wax boxes do. Though this is not as strong on the skin as other GIGI wax, you have to be careful or u r likely to pull some skin off too...</li>
    <li> the wax in not water soluble, cleaning is next to impossible. it should have been mentioned in product description</li>
    <li> The wax works and is very affordable. Much less expensive than going to the salon.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time and it worked well.  the heater kept it at a comfortable heat for my legs.  the temp was a little high for more sensitive areas.  I agree that this is very sticky messy stuff.  I am disappointed that it is not water soluble as is the wax used in the salons because that would make clean up much easier.  You can use baby oil to get the wax off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;helpful hints:  definately use the collar.  I cut a hole in a paper towel and use it over the collar and it works well for extra protection.  I spread paper towels and plastic bags on the floor and on surfaces where the wax might drip.  as i said, baby oil will get the residue off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;spread paper towels out to catch any drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slather on vaseline afterwards to get the wax off my hands, legs etc.  it works better than oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really would be MUCH better if this wax could just wash off with water.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this wax. It&#x27;s too liquid when heated and everything gets really sticky. You also need to buy waxing strips before you start waxing which makes the whole deal even more complicated. I would never buy this again. I would defintielly buy Sally Hansen.</li>
    <li> Aweful experience. I bought the Gigi set two years ago and have been Crazy about it ever since. Easy to use, wax is perfect, quick to dry and good removal. I bought the all purpose wax and was very dissappointed. When i tried it the first time it was hell, the was would never dry! It was sticky and mafe the whole process very messy and frustrating. Contrary to my previous experience. So i ordered for the Gigi Hard Wax which was the one that came in the set and am hoping i will go back to my routine!!</li>
    <li> I use this product for waxing eyebrows and lip. It is very convenient and it leaves a refreshing feeling after waxing is completed.</li>
    <li> I love this!! I&#x27;ve been working with it since august 2011 and it&#x27;s great. I am a student and I&#x27;e been waxing myself for years now and it&#x27;s perfect.  Really easy to use and heats up in no time.  Perfect for arms, and face and I also used it on a male friend for his chest and it was great! Totally recommend it</li>
    <li> I think this wax is a bit sticky than other waxes I have used  so far. It was hard peeling off the stripes because of the stickiness. Otherwise, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I use this product since last 6 months. I use GiGi warmer to warm it and it works like charm to me. There is no redness or stickiness to skin. I love this product. Easy to deal with it.</li>
    <li> i have purchased this product twice.. it works really good they only thing is it doesnt not catch all the hair on the skin and it is hard to wax your armpits so i am trying out another brand but i will still continue to use this one</li>
    <li> great product! I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I love this wax! I tried the Gigi cream wax and didn&#x27;t have much success until I switched to the All Purpose Honee. It&#x27;s a much cleaner experience and I felt it removed almost all the hair, as opposed to just breaking it off like the cream wax did.  I use it with the Gigi wax warmer and it heated up evenly and I felt it was a more simple process than other wax sets I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> My Gigi Wax warmer came along with the brazilian body hard wax, I hated it because it left a lot of residue on my skin and was hard to use, sometimes the muslin strip would come off without any wax and my skin would have all the sticky wax. I decided to try the All Purpose Honee and I must say its amazing!!! I used it today for the first time and it was ridiculously fast to use it, it&#x27;s so user friendly, you dont have to use a lot just a thin coat and it will do the work for you. Not messy at all, left my skin super soft plus there was barely any residue left, it&#x27;s so easy to remove and I doesn&#x27;t have any disgusting smell. If you&#x27;re not a pro at waxing get this, it will make your waxing so easy.</li>
    <li> This product was not a wax for all purpose; I just did not return it because it would be more expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. That being said all wax can be messy. Take your time with it. I love it though. Waxing knowledge comes from practice and I would say that the white paper strips are better than muslin strips at taking it off. I only found this through doing it though. All waxing leaves some hairs and you to go back over it. Give it a try and be patient.</li>
    <li> I have done waxing for a while and love this product. I have thick coarse hair and with the muslin strips comes out easy. I have wax warmer so not an issue with heating it. But if you don&#x27;t - heat up on small pan and then leave it in hot water (done this before I bought my warmer). If you need to wax regularly I recommend getting the wax warmer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using GIGI all purpose wax as far as i can remember. I found it on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
    <li> I WON&#x27;T USE ANY OTHER BRAND. MY HOLY GRAIL. AWESOME PRODUCT! SMELLS GREAT!</li>
    <li> Just a sticky mess. Did not work at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried the all purpose wax in the past but, I tried to be adventurous and try the chocolate wax, and the sensitive wax but none  of them work as well as this one. I am going to stay with this one.</li>
    <li> its a great price same product in store too expancive .and its same real good deal.i love it 100% recomand</li>
    <li> Pros: It does meet the expectation of removing hair in less time&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it takes a long time to melt the wax&lt;br /&gt;It is way too sticky than a regular wax that I am used too. Even after multiple wash the wax remains on parts of ur skin for at least a day. I found this annoying. I spent less time waxing and more time getting rid of the stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand this brand has a after wax lotion which will solve the problem of stickiness. I case u decide to buy this tag along the lotion.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this wax, and it can get quite hot. I liked that I was able to use it while it was still heating because part of it had melted while I was waiting for the entire can to heat up. It went on smooth and I only did small sections at a time. I personally like the hard wax more than soft wax and thats why I&#x27;m going to give it 4/5 stars. Just personal preference. This is the wax most people use in salons that I have visited as well.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of this wax. It is wayyy to sticky not very easy to work with. Definitely going back to NADS</li>
    <li> We are really sorry that we bought the whole shebang - Cooker - Wax - sticks.&lt;br /&gt;This makes a big mess but doesn&#x27;t work very well.  We also didn&#x27;t realize that when it drips onto anything, it is almost&lt;br /&gt;impossible to remove.  We&#x27;ve got a lot of sticky things now from using it one time.</li>
    <li> works  well,easy to use</li>
    <li> I wax at home and I prefer hard wax over soft wax. I don&#x27;t have to worry about disposing of strips (or having to replace them). This wax is really easy to work with. I think as long as you follow the proper steps to prepping and post waxing, you won&#x27;t experience any problems. I do recommend having a bottle of baby oil on hand. It made taking off any excess wax a lot easier.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how people are ripping their skin off with this product. It&#x27;s an easy to use and easy to clean up wax that I use for my legs exclusively, I use the brazilian hard wax for underarms. When warmed up to the right temp, it&#x27;s a calming wax that is to be applied thinly across an area of your leg (not too much, unless you&#x27;re a pro or just daring!) and you rip it off in the opposite direction with a muslin strip. To remove the wax, I use azulene oil that wipes the residue right off with no scrubbing/issues. After the waxing, I have nice smooth legs for at least 2 weeks! It&#x27;s a must buy for people who are sick of shaving every day!</li>
    <li> I like this wax very much because it rarely fails to remove the hair. It also takes out the very fine hair that may not be immediately visible. I count myself as a semi-professional waxer since I waxed myself for a decade! This product wins over all different types of waxes I tried, and now I am a loyal customer. I tried different variety of GiGi waxes, and I would say the All Purpose is better because it is not as harsh as Green Tea Oil version which can take off your skin and not as weak as Azulene one which I didn&#x27;t get it Azulene functionality.&lt;br /&gt;However, on contrary to the other two, this product line has a smell when it&#x27;s warm that I don&#x27;t like. It&#x27;s not too strong though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GiGi waxes are very sticky, so I spread a lot of newspapers around where I wax to protect the floor. Also, baby oil is your best friend when using this wax if you accidentally drop some waxes on your body or somewhere else.</li>
    <li> READ the directions - I should have bought a wax remover - baby oil is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always waxed my own legs with a cold sugar.. the time and quality make me shave instead most times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a professional use this on me years ago and couldn&#x27;t stop touching my smooth legs... I found it, tried it, LOVED it - but will read directions from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the warmer, I love using strips, and baby oil afterwards feels soothing</li>
    <li> Sticky and hard to use. Residue doesn&#x27;t come off with the Gigi lotion. Very difficult to remove residue. Got irritation on legs in some places after waxing, even though I just did half leg wax.</li>
    <li> If I could possible give a rating in minus, i would do that. The wax is such a mess. Inspite of using the wax warmer kit, i injured my hands and legs.  The wax literally sits on ur skin like it never wanna come off. The use of suggested wax strips was a waste. The wax was so hard on my skin that nothing could help me get it off except some acetone. I would rather prefer to have a hairy bush on my skin than trying this and injuring myself.  Amazon should not sell this product. Its harmful.&lt;br /&gt;Its been almost 2 hours since i have been cleaning up the mess on myself and in my restroom. Dont ever buy this. Never.Even if u have the complete kit. Its DANGEROURS</li>
    <li> I have been waxing my legs at home for 15 years - the only way to get a perfect, pain-minimized job and save some cash too. I have tried microwave versions, other brands, the other Gigi flavors, and none work on my pretty thick leg hair. I hate cleaning it up, but that is life. I usually put some body moisturizer on the drips and let it soak in for 2 minutes and then use a knife to scrap clean.</li>
    <li> I used this wax along with the GIGI warmer.&lt;br /&gt;This will absolutely get 99% of hairs the straglers are easily plucked out with a tweezer. This is a delicate formula because if I ever got waxed at a salon my skin would sting and feel puffy but my skin felt fine with ONLY hair being removed.&lt;br /&gt;Do&#x27;s: Use powder&lt;br /&gt;  Apply wax and then strip immediately.&lt;br /&gt;  Rub the strip for about 5-10 seconds and rip off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wash immediately after give your skin time to calm down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for amazon.com shipping was quick but I deducted a star for packaging. It was just rolling around in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw this was the first time I self waxed!</li>
    <li> This wax works, and works well, but my review will skip the obvious (yes, waxing hurts, yes, it takes some practice) and will jump to one major, major complaint.  This wax INCREDIBLY, miserably sticky if you get somewhere unintended.  If you get this wax anywhere unintended that&#x27;s not a cold tile floor (scraping it off tile with a razor works well), then good luck to ya!  I have switched to a creme wax that&#x27;s not as intense, that won&#x27;t pull the chrome off a bumper...</li>
    <li> I have had wax done for the last 15 years so i feel  i know a lot about waxing. This is the worse wax ever. I try it and it never dry out to be able to take it out. A  real nightmare</li>
    <li> Works perfectly the cream wax came in my kit so this was a shot in the dark to find a wax that works for me as the cream wax did not so very happy it does work... yay</li>
    <li> I have used all different types of Gigi waxes and this is the best. Plus this is the best price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this wax for my wife to go with the wax warmer i bought her. It works just perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Does like it is supposed to. I really enjoy the GiGi product line. I think the wax is really effective and is plenty sticky to actually pull the hair out at the root and not break it in half like some other products do.</li>
    <li> Product itself was great but the Amazon distribution must have left it in a hot place because all the Honee had melted &amp; leaked out of the plastic lid &amp; was inside the packaging...thus I could not use it. I have been trying to notify Amazon distribution but because this is not a returnable I could not click on the link to let them know. Thus I lost my purchase price for nothing.</li>
    <li> Not good. Wax never dries, very sticky and never comes off. Do not attempt to use this if you are not a professional. And never try to use it on yourself !!</li>
    <li> I give this product 4 stars because it was very very efficient at removing hair. I&#x27;m not very sensitive to the pain- I found it quite regular. I used it on my legs and it worked like a charm. The down side to it is that it is SUPER sticky. I am very experienced with waxing (&gt; 10 years now), and I thought the others were being too fussy when they said it was sticky, but they&#x27;re not. It is. It is the stickiest wax I have handled in 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few things I did to get the most of it though :&lt;br /&gt;1) I kept the heat setting on the warmer at high even as I was waxing, to ensure that it didn&#x27;t get spread on too thick. I also used a metal spatula ( an old blunt butter knife) which was easier for me to handle.&lt;br /&gt;2) I dusted my skin with talcum powder, and kept it handy to dust my hands with, as I was waxing. Also, while pressing the wax strips on firmly, they tend to get sticky. I used the powder here as well, to minimize the stickyness.&lt;br /&gt;2) After waxing I used the Clean + Easy Remove After Wax Remover ( find my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ESBH9IP5KKH0) to get rid of the wax, followed by a hot shower. Even after the shower as you pat yourself dry, keep an eye out for missed spots of wax, apply the oil and rub off the wax with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish the product I have, but will try out other brands before buying another one!</li>
    <li> I am just starting to wax my own legs, after having it done at a local esthetics school (I&#x27;m a willing guinea pig and too frugal to pay for the spa experience; just get the job done!) for several years. This wax works well but is sticky. You can also see through it; I&#x27;d prefer something more opaque so you can better see where you&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
    <li> Works good... Compared to sugaring is a bit more painful at first but later as hair grows thinner it will hurt less, besides that maybe you are getting used to it... Nonetheless, whether you&#x27;ll use this wax or sugar wax, remember to always apply baby powder to the area you will epilate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have found that this wax removes more hair per application than the sugar wax so maybe that why it hurts more, but we use it mainly for the arm pit for that same reason, one pull and all the hair is gone...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the cleaning side be careful as you will not be able to clean it easily by just using water or soapy water... petroleum jelly works OK... if you are going to clean a hard surface you can also use nail polish remover, just don&#x27;t do it on the skin as the are you just epilated will be very sensitive and ... just don&#x27;t do it... on the skin use petroleum jelly rubbing gently...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use this all purpose wax for mostly anything besides bikini area... for bikini area we use a home-made sugar wax as it hurts less and it&#x27;s easier to clean (using plain water vs using petroleum jelly)...</li>
    <li> The product is OK, received on time as mentioned, but i dont have used many times so i cannot give the exact quality of the product.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time ordering this product! I love it and the warmer.  They are perfect to keep the wax hot enough to work with and not have to run to the microwave all the time.  I&#x27;ve even got my mother hooked on waxing now with this stuff!</li>
    <li> It will do the purpose, however, it is sticky and it will heart your skin badly!&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> for all your waxing needs....great stuff...last forever!</li>
    <li> Ordered this item for the first time 8 oz in July,2014 and it worked, so ordered again 14 oz in Jan 2015.&lt;br /&gt;But this time quality was nowhere near the first one, poor quality wax, it didn&#x27;t help to pull out any hair on applying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the gigi hard wax eversince i started doing it myself and i didnt have any complaints! I just got interested with this product, so i gave it try! Well i&#x27;m not mad, because it&#x27;s my choice but for everyone&#x27;s sake im doing this review. First it&#x27;s MESSIER!!!! It sticks everywhere! It&#x27;s a bit runny and so sticky. Second, it leaves more residue than the hard wax. And lastly it&#x27;s more difficult to control. Im still gonna use it though.</li>
    <li> I have used all kinds of soft waxes but this &amp;#34;old standby&amp;#34; has not failed me as of yet. Great.</li>
    <li> Very sticky wax . Hard to clean Nd if something is left on skin it won&#x27;t come out even with soap and warm water I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> It is a lot of wax.you wont run out for whatever you&#x27;re trying to do. What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t remove all of the hairs but rather rips them off at the pore. I know how to wax I&#x27;ve been doing it for years. This product is the only one i&#x27;ve had this kind of problem with. It&#x27;s really cheap but it&#x27;s virtually ineffective.</li>
    <li> I used this wax for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so hard to take it off..i had to use a strip 2-3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is , it stuck to my hands and feet, so badly. And the box only says use gigi wax remover to clean up. Wht if i dont have it ..i tried a lot of things and even taking a shower didnt help..it felt like it was still sticking all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally i read a review which said I could use baby oil, which helped... I threw the wax box..never buying it again !!!</li>
    <li> Terrible! DO NOT use this. Very unmanageable, not water soluble and can&#x27;t get it off! literally like trying to wax with superglue!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item by mistake,  instead of the hard wax.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This product works great at waxing large surfaces like legs.  I would recommend switching to hard wax for pits and Brazilian though.</li>
    <li> I used a different brand before using this and hair used to reappear very soon. But with use of this brand, the hair takes longer to grow back. May be that depends on a person&#x27;s skin type. But I like this one very much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of wax and the All-Purpose Honee is serviceable.  It does the job it&#x27;s intended for; it has its flaws, but if you apply it correctly it doesn&#x27;t leave a ginormous mess.  What I found to help was that instead of powder I used GiGi&#x27;s Pre-Epilation Oil; I rubbed a couple of drops of that onto my legs before waxing them and the stuff came right off and took the hair with it.  (Just make sure it&#x27;s a VERY little bit of oil; blot with a paper towel before waxing if you need to, too much oil and the wax won&#x27;t stick to anything!)  You also have to make sure you lay it on VERY thin. I had to keep a sharp eye out for drips and stray bits; this wax goes on almost clear, so it&#x27;s pretty easy to lose track of little spots on my very fair skin.  As long as I caught them fast, though, they came right off with the quick application of a strip.  I didn&#x27;t even need baby oil.  It&#x27;s not a bad product, as long as it&#x27;s used right; I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my mostest favoritest wax in the entire world, but it&#x27;s a really good value for the price and it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> I use this to wax my eyebrows. Love it! I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 2 years now and I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> I thought the sticky mess was because of my inexperience with waxing by myself, but it turns out it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using both thick and thin layers of wax, and both leave a mess... it works better with thin layers though. You will waste a bunch of waxing strips, because you will have to redo most of the areas at least twice, and that irritates my very sensitive skin A LOT. So yes, it will leave a mess behind, but the reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars it&#x27;s because it somewhat leaves the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to remove the sticky mess, use baby oil and a rub any cotton fabric against it, it will do the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> very sticky and hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Good wax for all over!</li>
    <li> I wish I had not bought this system.  Because I live quite a ways from where I get my brows waxed, I thought it would be great to be able to do it myself at home.  Hopefully it will get easier as time goes on, but it was miserable the first time.  The instructions are extremely vague.  Something like, &amp;#34;paint it on and peel it off&amp;#34;. No specifics like duration, etc.  I about ripped my face off trying, and left a red rough area that took 2 weeks to heal.  It seems like all the ingredients are included to be able to do this, just not the instructions.</li>
    <li> As other people have already noted, this wax is STICKY. Really sensitive skin may have trouble with it.  And no matter what you do in advance, you are gonna have sticky traces at the end.  These just have to wear off on their own--no amount of oil is going to get them off, and anything that will really dissolve it (nail polish remover, Goo Gone) is going to be too harsh for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that same stickiness makes it really, really effective at removing hair--WAY more effective than the expensive salon brands.  For me, getting all the hair off my legs is the big priority, and with Honee you have only one or two to tweeze per strip.  I also like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t bleed through the strips easily.  You can use the same muslin about three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, to avoid killing your skin: use the oil.  Without a medium to heavy application of oil, the wax won&#x27;t come off at all.  If you find you&#x27;ve used too much, you can rub some off easily with a cloth.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely sticky and messy. Under the product description, its mentioned that it is easily washable with soap but once it sticks, it wont remove. It sticks to your body like a glue. Please save yourself and think twice before buying this product.</li>
    <li> It works Good and clean all the hair but gives a hard time to remove it from skin. I use a oil to remove it from my skin which I got with my another honey was but still not able to clean all the wax from skin. I am waxing my body hair from 8 years. I think i would go with sally Hensen honey wax. It really cleans all the haor from skin but because of it gives hard time to remove wax from skin I would not go with it.</li>
    <li> Okay, I will admit I&#x27;m bashful, I did NOT like the idea of going into a salon and... well, you know how it works. I was about to go to the beach and hate shaving every day, I always get razor burn very badly no matter how careful I am. So I got a Sally Beauty coupon and went and bought one of their wax warmers which came with a free tin of the All Purpose Honee. Also purchased sticks and muslin strips but that&#x27;s not part of this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, keep in mind I have never been to a pro salon. I also did not watch any Youtube videos. I simply read some of the advice on here and used some common sense. Though it was a little rough to start out I think it turned out pretty darn good and I didn&#x27;t have to shave the whole week at the beach - first time since puberty! (yes, it is THAT exciting.) Not a single ingrown hair nor burn nor irritated skin. Keep in mind this is from a girl who tried using Nair and was bleeding from her pores within 2 minutes, so my skin is pretty sensitive, and I find it incredibly impressive that I had absolutely no issues. In fact I just waxed my legs for my second time and I must be doing something right because in most places it was fairly painless - no more than a light slap, nothing to even flinch at - and yes I checked each strip that I had pulled hair out by the root. No, I do not have a high pain tolerance either, in fact I tear up if I even stub my toe or get a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a list of my regimen and tips. Take or leave what you want:&lt;br /&gt;- Shower the night before or morning before as per usual, and use a loofah to scrub and exfoliate very well.&lt;br /&gt;- Day of, warm the wax to a honey consistency. My warmer only had \\&quot;off\\&quot; and \\&quot;on\\&quot; so it got the wax too hot to a syrup consistency, which did burn, so I had to keep turning the warmer on and off. This is something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;- Spread an old towel out where you&#x27;re sitting and working. For me, it went from the toilet seat where I sat, and draped over the tub side, where I put my foot.&lt;br /&gt;- I did not use any oil. I instead used baby powder, aka talc powder. Just brush it on your skin all over, rub for a few seconds to brush extra off. Works like a charm, just don&#x27;t go overboard. You can also put baby powder on sticky spots on your towel and on your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;- Start at the bottom of the hairy section - aka the end where all the hair is pointing - and work up. Much easier than starting in the middle. Also watch where hair is pointing, for example on the back of your legs your hair probably grows sideways, not up.&lt;br /&gt;- Do NOT chicken out halfway through a pull. I learned from experience that it hurts a LOT more to lose your grip and leave the strip, than to just yank it all off. If you&#x27;re nervous then do a smaller section at a time, but make SURE you take it off cleanly every time. That second yank is a bear, especially in sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;- Strips can be used more than once for economy&#x27;s sake but they should be replaced after maybe 3-4 pulls, because there&#x27;s so much wax on them.&lt;br /&gt;- When I finish I use a damp cloth to remove any residue wax (which is hardly anything) and then liberally apply Vaseline to the skin. This protects and moisturizes the skin and so far has completely averted any irritation from waxing. Just don&#x27;t wear tight pants while your skin is all Vaseline-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH and BTW I purchased the 8-ounce can from Sally&#x27;s and it has gotten me through 2 leg waxes and a bikini wax. So... $10 can of wax or $200 and 3 hours worth of salon expenses? Yeah, I know which one I&#x27;m buying.re I put my foot.&lt;br /&gt;- I did not use any oil.

    <li> This wax is very sticky and when you touch a surface is almost imposibe to remove.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard work this wax texture so fine that literally sticks to your hands and all that is around him.</li>
    <li> Good product, and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with the warmer and Brazilian hard wax. The first week of August I waxed my lower and upper legs with this product and waxed my bikini line with the Brazilian hard wax. My bikini line and upper legs grew back within about 3 weeks (as expected) but my lower leg hair has yet to grow back?? I don&#x27;t want to get my hopes up but it would be awesome if I permanently damaged the root or something hahah. The reason I gave this only 4 stars was because it caused my upper legs to have bumps for about 2 weeks after I waxed. I do have very sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t exfoliate much after waxing so this is probably my own fault and could have been prevented. I&#x27;m just gonna cross my fingers that the hair never grows back :D.. Anyone else encounter this???</li>
    <li> Better than the cream wax</li>
    <li> This wax was stuck on my body for 3 days I had to put oil all over me to remove it. How am I supposed to use a product and have to put oil on me afterwards every single time?!!! It works nice but after I&#x27;m done it&#x27;s a freaking nightmare!!!!</li>
    <li> I had  purchased the Gigi warmer(which I love) and needed a wax to go with it. I opened it up and released it was very liquidly even at room temperature. It seemed to have a honey consistency and got all over my finger tips when I opened it. I later found it was nearly impossible to get it off your hands. Despite having trouble washing it off my hands I decided to try using it to wax anyway. I applied it and pressed a strip on it. When I tried to rip it in the other direction it was the most painful waxing I had ever hand. Plus it didn&#x27;t even get all of the wax off. So, not only did it rip parts of my skin off, i was going to have to try to rip it off again! This didn&#x27;t work so I had to try to scrub off the leftover honey. It took me an hour and was extremely painful. Image scrubbing already irritated skin with a sugar scrub and having to resort to scraping it off with a butter knife! I would never recommend  this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Ok, the wax does the job, removes the hair that is, but people be very careful, this is a very very sticky business. I&#x27;ve been vexing myself for over ten years but never bought a wax as sticky as this one before. And never will again. Horrible.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected but my experience with wax is minimal so this review might be a bit unfair.  I usually use natural honey/sugar waxes but I wanted to try something new and thought this honey wax would be a good transition.  Clean up is a nightmare.  My sink got so messy and I ended up throwing out all the wax strips I used whereas I would wash them and reuse them with the natural stuff.  I&#x27;ll likely be going back to honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus though is it does a better job with fine hair and shorter hair than my natural honey/sugar waxes.  I would usually have to go back on the waxed area a few days later to get the shorter hairs and avoid the damage on my skin.  With this wax, majority if not most of the hair comes out, even the finer and shorter strands.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and excellent product!</li>
    <li> This wax worked great on my skin. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so it may not work for everyone. It also had a chemical smell which my other brands never did, but that may be why it worked better - more industrial strength. Worth a try if you a looking for something better.</li>
    <li> Great standard wax. It&#x27;s very versitile and you can use it on almost any part of the body.&lt;br /&gt;I will happily buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SUPER FAST SHIPPING*</li>
    <li> This wax is really hard. If some left during waxing, it is so sticky that t becomes really hard to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy this again</li>
    <li> stick on my skin, and won&#x27;t wash away, disgusting! WIll never buy again! stick on my skin, and won&#x27;t wash away, disgusting! WIll never buy again!</li>
    <li> I own the GIGI warmer and this is the perfect size for a refill at a very reasonable price. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Someone who is new to the waxing thing...this is very basic and nice product.&lt;br /&gt;First time I ordered a wrong type of wax...then found out this one. As the name says it&#x27;s All purpose wax.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gigi Hemp Wax for months, and I thought I loved it, until I tried the Gigi all purpose honee wax! The hemp wax removed only the longest hairs, and left substantial stubble behind.  I purchased the Gigi all purpose honee at Sally&#x27;s because the manager said it was their best selling wax, so I thought I would give it a try and I LOVE it! I was amazed at how it removed all of my hair on the first try, and even waxing on the back of the leg above the knee was not as painful as with other waxes! I am never switching again, I have found my wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything from shaving, epilating (causes too many ingrown hairs), Nair (left burns on my legs for a week, and still didn&#x27;t get all the hair off!).  My first wax experience with wax was Gigi strip free, but I think this one is much more cost effective and easy to use.  It requires a warmer, because it&#x27;s in a metal container so you can&#x27;t microwave it.  I had a &#x27;little dipper&#x27; that I had never used that came with a crock pot purchase, and that&#x27;s what I use! I line the inside of the little dipper with foil or wax paper, put the whole jar of wax in, and plug it in.  It takes several hours to warm up, so plan ahead.  A few tips that I learned the HARD way....make sure your wax is hot! If it is too cool, it goes on too thick and the hair won&#x27;t come off, but some of your skin may.  My next point, thinner is better! Never apply your wax too thick, and wax the area once, maybe twice, but no more than that at one time because the skin gets irritated and starts to burn.  Make sure the area you are going to wax is dry, not sweaty or oily, or wet.  Your skin will be pretty itchy when you finish, and many people will apply a cream like bikini zone to help with this, but I don&#x27;t because I try to avoid the chemical junk.  So, wax, then get in the shower with a good sugar scrub (mix sugar and oil together-cheap and easy, I use hemp oil now, but just use what you have) and scrub the waxed areas.  Then get out, dry off, and I apply a handful of an organic food grade oil (I use Nutiva organic hemp, it&#x27;s cheap and nver causes any irritation or clogged pores) mixed with many drops of tea tree oil.  Rub this over the waxed areas, and it works just as good as bikini zone, but it&#x27;s cheaper and healthier.  The first time you wax will be the most painful; don&#x27;t give up-you will be surprised at how little it hurts after that.  Be sure and order the gigi wax cloth/muslin strips (pack of 100) with your wax.  And if you are fast enough, you can use the same strip multiple times.  Just apply your wax to a large area going down, in the same direction as the hair grows, give it about fifteen seconds, then firmly press your strip on it and pull up (in the opposite direction that the hair grows) parallel to your leg.  Do not pull up and away from your leg, because that hurts like hell and doesn&#x27;t take any hair off.  Keep up with your waxing, if you let your hair grow back in as thick as it was the first time, of course, it will hurt.  I did wax twice a week with the hemp wax, but only once a week with the all purpose honee, and I&#x27;m a pretty hairy beast, so that seems to work for me ;-pt out, dry off, and I apply a handful of an organic food grade oil (I use Nutiva organic hemp, it&#x27;s cheap and nver causes any irritation or clogged pores) mixed with many drops of tea tree oil.  Rub this over the waxed areas, and it works just as good as bikini zone, but it&#x27;s cheaper and healthier.  The first time you wax will be the most painful; don&#x27;t give up-you will be surprised at how little it hurts after that.  Be sure and order the gigi wax cloth/muslin strips (pack of 100) with your wax.  And if you are fast enough, you can use the same strip multiple times.  Just apply your wax to a large area going down, in the same direction as the hair grows, give it about fifteen seconds, then firmly press your strip on it and pull up (in the opposite direction that the hair grows) parallel to your leg.

    <li> Hated it. Does not work plus it peeled off my daughter&#x27;s skin. It left her a bi scar plus it is super messy. Really hated it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a bad batch but this wax is pretty bad. It&#x27;s extremely sticky so it&#x27;s horrible when it drips on you or your fingers. Doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair. Can&#x27;t wait to go through it so I can try another brand.</li>
    <li> Ive been waxing for so long that I bought the heater kit and do it myself. Legs are easy to do and with the cost of this honee wax,  I save $50 - $75 from having a professional do it.</li>
    <li> Gentle with the sking&lt;br /&gt;melt in 25 minutes&lt;br /&gt;last a long time&lt;br /&gt;with just e few is enough&lt;br /&gt;remember to use the cloth pads&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wax with the at-home waxer for 5 years and I LOVE it! I have extremely sensitive skin and this wax is much less painful than others and never irritates my skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the only wax that I have ever used that heats to the perfect consistency and takes off my course, thick, Indian hair on the first try. Yes, it is really sticky, but you have to be prepared with baby oil and wax cleaner and take your time. I&#x27;ve tried using microwavable waxes (Sally Hansen, for example) and can never get the wax to the right consistency. It ends up being far messier than using GiGi wax + a wax warmer. Sometimes with those brands the wax wouldn&#x27;t stick to the strip and I&#x27;d have to wait for it to completely dry before applying oil to try to remove it and in the end would be left with patches of hairs. What a pain! This wax gets it on the first try. I use this wax monthly to give my self a brazillian, underarm, and tummy wax. To effectively use this wax you need:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-wax warmer&lt;br /&gt;-different sized applicators&lt;br /&gt;-cloth wax strips (you can buy a role and cut to the desired size)&lt;br /&gt;-talcum poweder to apply on skin prior to waxing&lt;br /&gt;-trimmers to trim the hair, otherwise it will hur too much and probably not come off right away&lt;br /&gt;-small mirror to see hard-to-reach areas&lt;br /&gt;-baby oil to remove excess wax from body&lt;br /&gt;-Gigi sure clean wax cleaner to remove wax from the ground/warmer&lt;br /&gt;-tweezers post-waxing to get the few hairs left over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the above and work in small patches you should have a good waxing experience. Take your time and remember that even if you spend 1 hour giving yourself a brazillian at-home, it&#x27;st worth saving $50+ a month to get it at a salon. Plus, while other people are shaving every few days you don&#x27;t have to deal with your hair except every 3-5 weeks.</li>
    <li> I get this on a regular basis &amp; works like a charm.  Use in the self-warmer &amp; heats up quickly &amp; does the trick!</li>
    <li> This wax warms up to a good consistency and adheres to the muslin strips very well.  The only drawback is that it&#x27;s so sticky that it creates quite a clean up job.</li>
    <li> If you have nay left wax on your skin when you clean up, it will turn into a white gum-like substance which is IMPOSSIBLE to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent an hour in the shower trying to clean it off. I found that using dish soap helps, then use Cetaphil lotion and paper towels to finish off. Still a lot of gunk left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Pros: It goes on easily enough and takes off... well, about a third of the hair, so not terribly effective. But hey, it smooths on easily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It doesn&#x27;t come off. Anything. At all. No, I lie, if you use Lysol bleach toilet cleaner and a heavy duty scrubbing pad, it will eventually come off if you spill some or happen to touch anything while trying to figure out how on earth to get the goopy sticky mess off your legs. 1 test patch (2x4 inches) &#x3D; 2 hours of trying to get the stuff off my leg (and by extension, off my hands, and off anything my hands touched during that period- impromptu haircut? Sure, why not!) Teatree oil eventually helped somewhat, since bleach and open wounds don&#x27;t generally go together too well- though out of desperation I did double check that one. Yup, it does burn. I scrubbed my leg in hot water with soap/shampoo/conditioner/teatree soap/apricot scrub and a heavy duty pot-cleaning scrubbing pad (after the washcloth gummed up so badly it had to be thrown out, without seemingly removing any of the stuff. Kind of impressive, now I think of it). Now my leg hurts, my bathroom still has sticky spots and the residue which I still haven&#x27;t totally removed from my leg is collecting cat hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: Painful, scrubbed raw leg, sticky body and apartment, unwanted haircut, un-removable, ineffective. Negative stars. Lots and lots of negative stars.</li>
    <li> this wax does the job fairly, but is not water soluble. It is a pain getting off and it terribly stained my carpet and my bathroom tiles. I was expecting a more sugar based, water soluble natural wax and the &amp;#34;honee&amp;#34; part of this product is misleading.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for 3 years. I’m African American and the only woman in my family with hairy legs. If I shave today I have stubble tomorrow. When I use this wax I’m hair free for 2-4 weeks. I wasn’t into the idea of going to a salon to pay someone to do something that I believed I was capable of. So I decided to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;It is a unique sensation. Not unbearable just different. I lay a dollar store plastic tablecloth on the floor before I start. Apply the wax in a thin coat in the direction of the hair growth. I use oil afterward to remove any residual wax from my skin. I apply the oil and rub it away in a warm shower.&lt;br /&gt;Don’t wax near on carpet or furniture. The wax is extremely difficult to remove. If it gets on tile or linoleum us oil to remove it. It is water soluble but oil works best.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used the oil collars for the warmer. I prefer lining the warmer with aluminum foil. The wax still heats but it doesn’t get inside the warmer. The wax container is metal and cannot be used in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;You must use muslin to remove this wax but Gigi does make a hard wax.</li>
    <li> So did not work well for me bummer wanted to do my own brazillian waxing. ,( oh my ) totally stuck my self together lol good for face and arms and legs</li>
    <li> This wax is great because it&#x27;s very delicate with skin. This is also great because it&#x27;s strip waxing not hard waxing. I definitely recommend this for those who have thick, coarse and long hair almost all over the body.</li>
    <li> Worst wax I ever used. It is very sticky and messy. It leaves dark spots on my underarms and burn my skin. Hairs donot come out at first time. I had really bad experience using Gigi honey wax. Won&#x27;t buy it in future</li>
    <li> came on time and was exactly as it was shown online</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gigi wax for sensitive skin and bought this by mistake thinking it was the same thing.  I love this product way better!  It doesn&#x27;t seem as messy somehow, and I can even reuse my strips a few times if I&#x27;m quick while the wax is still warm on the cloth.</li>
    <li> Use with a layer of baby oil on the skin for best results. Remove from body using baby oil or remove from surfaces using SureClean.</li>
    <li> This one makes my legs extremely itchy! I&#x27;m not sure why. Maybe it would do that with any wax. I&#x27;m not sure. But this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried on my legs.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Very sticky and harsh on skin.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, just don&#x27;t warm it up 100 %. As soon it starts melting from the corners...you can start too. If you will wait for the whole wax to melt than it&#x27;s not only time consuming but it gets messy too. The quality of wax is really good. Leaves skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Easy wax to use.  It applies evenly and smoothly.  Haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions to it.  Directions say to put on high until it melts and then move to medium.  Found that this makes it too hot so I just melt it slow on low to med heat.  If your skin is dry this may stick to your skin so I would put on some oil or lotion first and then blot off the excess slickness.  When applied right this wax lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> There is no way you can get rid of this if even the tiniest speck is left on you. Its soooo sticky. I hate it!</li>
    <li> Worst product ever... If you love your skin so please do not buy it DO NOT,,,,I ordered this wax &amp; after just one time use I throw it in trash it was just wastage of money.</li>
    <li> First thing, it doesn&#x27;t do any wonder than other waxes. Second thing, once you used it, it is almost impossible to remove its residue from your finger tip, the area you applied on, floor, chair, bowl, cloths or wherever you have put this product on. Other wax can be removed just by using water, means just wash it away but this product not. it gets more worst. its kind of glue not wax. Don&#x27;t buy this product, its a nightmare.</li>
    <li> Wow, the majority of the negative reviews on this are because the users didn&#x27;t know how to get the wax off??? Giving a product a bad review because you don&#x27;t know how to use it is lame. Professional wax does not come off with water or alcohol, it comes off with oil. It&#x27;s also very sticky so you can use a thin layer, which grabs smaller hairs better than thick layers of less sticky wax. Being sticky is the whole point of wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lack of knowledge and bad advice from friends doesn&#x27;t make this a bad product. This is a good dependable wax in my experience.</li>
    <li> I like, I used it in my first time waxing and it was not that bad!</li>
    <li> All purpose Honee is better than any other GIGI waxes out there. much less painful and gets the most with one try.</li>
    <li> I prefer the hard wax over this.  There is clearly a learning curve and I just never mastered it.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but the can was dented. Next time I will order from another distributor.</li>
    <li> I have been using this wax for years and I love this stuff.. I normally get it from sally beauty supply store but I saw a great deal here on amazon. Item shipped real fast.. Highly recommended product if you know how to use it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I used this wax recently and was very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It is much better, stronger and stickier than the regular microwave waxes available in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of similar to Sally Hansen Brazilian wax in stickiness, and doesn&#x27;t wash off with water and soap. After you are done waxing, use baby oil (I use the Johnson&amp;Johnson baby oil) to remove the stickiness of the few spots of wax remaining on your skin. As I mentioned earlier, this wax does not wash off with water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wished for is that it smelled better. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, infact doesn&#x27;t smell much at all. I wish they added a little touch of scent in it.</li>
    <li> its good for vaxing purpose even best but very sticky, when even a single drop fall in floor then very difficult to remove it.</li>
    <li> The more I use this wax, the better I get at using it.  The wax comes off easily using the muslin strips.  After a complete wax, I wipe down the areas with Olive Oil and it gets the remaining wax off that I missed.  This wax is easy to use and works well on the legs, under the arms and for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This product is a hot mess.....i brought this product since I got the warmer..... the skin feels sticky even after days of waxing n multiple warm water wash.... its definitely uncomfortable to use and doesn&#x27;t do a great job, peals your skin off..... wouldn&#x27;t use it again</li>
    <li> this wax is a real pain. it gets a good, firm grip on the hairs which is nice, but it also tries to take your skin with it. it worked well on my legs (i was even impressed by how short some of the hairs it grabbed were), but it REALLY hurt to use on my face. this wax leaves a lot of sticky residue, too. it&#x27;s a real pain in the butt to clean compared to a hard/stripless wax... the lid&#x27;s hard to get off the jar... wah wah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;long story short: if you&#x27;ve never used a hard wax, this stuff seems pretty great. if you REALLY hate cleaning up sticky messes (and being a sticky mess), try the gigi hard brazilian wax instead.</li>
    <li> This is good wax at a great price. Be careful-a little goes a long way. Start w less because you can add more but hard to remove. Very sticky and stringy. Like lots of hot cheese on a fresh-from-the-oven pizza.</li>
    <li> This wax is great only one time I received bent container which caused a whole lot opf a mess in the warmer! Please be carefull when shipping. Tx</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I use this on my legs and I find that it doesn&#x27;t pull out all the hairs and it rips others. I get an uneven...I suppose...hairy experience after a few days and I have to shave the leftovers that this wax didn&#x27;t pull out. I had a better experience with the Sally Hansen&#x27;s brand you can buy in drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to mention I am an Asian woman with light skin and dark black and thick hairs. Maybe that made a difference as well, perhaps I need a stronger wax. Until then I plan to use this until I run out and then I&#x27;ll probably go try something else.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing my legs at home for many years. I use a GiGi warmer that I bought 10 years ago - still going strong! - and have only used GiGi wax. (Thinking of all the money and time I&#x27;ve saved over the years makes me happy :-). I don&#x27;t know if the formula has changed but this All Purpose Honee is the best I&#x27;ve used so far! It goes on smoothly and it is easy to apply a thin layer. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and most importantly, is very effective at removing the hair. I also think it can be used on sensitive skin. I will be buying this wax from now on.</li>
    <li> serves the purpose and works on any hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but too sticky</li>
    <li> This wax is amazing! So easy to use and great for sensitive skin. I use it for bikini and it is a lot less painful than their Brazilian and it comes off easily afterward!</li>
    <li> Works but is very sticky.</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible! I have been using at home waxing for 15 years+ and never have i used such a sticky, gross products. My skin is on fire burning red from scrubbing all the wax off (yes, with baby oil like other reviewers who strangely seem to like this product say) BUT even that does not work without some good about of scrubbing, it ruins clothes, floors too. Awful. why do you even have to use a remover to remove! it is because it is made of crap chemicals!! you can make a perfectly decent wax with sugar, water and lemon and that type of wax washes off easily, DO NOT BUY this CRAP</li>
    <li> I received Gigi Honee wax and the container had been bent so half the wax had spilled out in the shipping container.  I cleaned it up and then used it and there was a leak at the bottom and now my wax heater has wax in it.</li>
    <li> This is the stickiest, nastiest wax I&#x27;ve ever used. I literally opened it, attempted to use it, and threw it away. It didn&#x27;t grip the hair, it pulled my skin, difficult to control, and made everything sticky. It took me forever to figure out how to make my hands free of sticky: rubbing alcohol then oil. Don&#x27;t waste your time. Don&#x27;t make yourself sticky.</li>
    <li> Not only did the product not work, it left a residue that remained for days. Couldn&#x27;t remove with alcohol or soap. Ended up with my face breaking out all over from the open pores getting infected. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> Very thick and sticky!&lt;br /&gt;Does not wash off at all. requires only cream or oil..difficult to manage.&lt;br /&gt;i will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. It was cheap, there was a lot of wax in the container. It&#x27;s clean and easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily or messy. Takes off hair very easily.</li>
    <li> Great Product! My wife makes sure to order this every month!</li>
    <li> It is messy even when I applied baby oil before waxing. It feels more like glue and leftovers really sticks to the skin. It even peeled skin from  some parts, which was horrible. They gave it in a pack of 4 , such a waste of money. I searched on the internet and couldn&#x27;t find any way to remove the leftover spots of wax from my skin. :(&lt;br /&gt; I have 5 yrs of experience in waxing ,never used this type of wax. Sadly , on internet , this is only one with lots of good reviews.</li>
    <li> Should have sent it all back.  This is the stickiest mess I have ever dealt with. When I opened the box and noticed how some of the wax had seeped out from under the lid amd could not get it off my hands I should have stopped right there, but after reading lots of reviews and tips I went ahead anyway.  I only wax my upper lip.  In the past I have used Sally Hansen&#x27;s little wax warmer and had very good results. But when that ran out I started looking for replacement wax and could not find it, so ordered this wax, the warmer and the muslin roll.  I used baby powder on my upper lip but still have sticky residue on my face and hands.  I have used Vaseline, olive oil, hand lotion and Dawn dishwashing liquid and I can&#x27;t get it off.  At this point I guess I will have to wait for it to wear off.  What a mess.</li>
    <li> I have worked in spas for years and gigi is often used by the aestheticism and cosmetologists. I use it at home for my own use and it works great!</li>
    <li> This wax does a good job removing hair but it is wayy to sticky!! I had to use nail paint remover to remove the wax that fell on the floor! Wont recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> This wax literary SHED my SKIN OFF, it has left scars all over my arms and im scared that it will stay like that permanently. Dont use this product if you are not familiar with it and if you do make sure you test it in an unvisible part of your body. It took my hair off for the most part except for some of the spots where it took the skin off. If you see alot of redness than more than likely it took your skin off. I thought my redness was normal until I realized that it was actullly skin that was taken off! :(. Did this happen to anyone and if it did how did you treat it? Its been almost a week and the marks are still really noticeable and im tired of wearing long sleeve shirts!</li>
    <li> perfect for all hair types i love it removes all the hair leaves non behind would definitely recommend it and will always buy it.</li>
    <li> The lid is difficult to open. Content don&#x27;t last for more than two usages. I did not see the advantage over other cheaper products.</li>
    <li> This wax is my favorite.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to heat.  I recommend this item to anyone seeking waxing.</li>
    <li> This wax does remove the hair but OH MY GOSH, it is such a pain in the butt to remove off your skin! The \\&quot;Wax Off\\&quot; solution doesn&#x27;t even work. It just makes the wax creamy-sticky instead of just sticky! Getting this crap off my nails is another issue for sure! If you want really GOOD wax, then It&#x27;s all about the Persian Wax.. That product comes off with water! Seriously, I&#x27;m throwing out my Gigi wax after I post this!</li>
    <li> I used this wax on my legs and it removed the hair nicely. Some of the wax was still stuck on the edges but I used the same muslin strip to take it off and it picked the extra wax up. I also tried this wax on my bikini and more sensitive areas (for a brazilian) and it ripped off patches of skin (BAD IDEA!!!). This could have been happened because the skin down there is thinner and not as tough as the skin on my legs. The wax was is super sticky and can only be removed with another oil such as baby oil or cooking oil such as canola/corn/olive oil. I&#x27;d also recommend using with gloves because if you get it on your skin, it&#x27;ll just stick and does not wash off with water.</li>
    <li> I had a terrible experience using this wax. Spent almost 3 hours getting this wax off my skin...its sticky than usually expected. I don&#x27;t advice this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> it is amazing and cheaper than sallys solon</li>
    <li> Love this wax! Great to use if you know how to properly use the product. If not you can seriously burn yourself.</li>
    <li> This wax one is nothing but a huge disaster waiting to happen in a jar. It&#x27;s sticky and icky and I almost threw it out my window.</li>
    <li> very thin when warm. Not bonding enough</li>
    <li> I buy it on the regular basis, it&#x27;s the best one I found so far. Not very messy and works well!</li>
    <li> Get it professionally done… this is just messy and doesn&#x27;t work all that great. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great wax! I use it for arms, legs, brows, face, and sometimes for bikini areas. It can leave a sticky residue, but a good wax remover after does the trick. No irritation either!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this one. But buy HARD WAX! Like others said I had the same experience with this product. It didn&#x27;t get hard after I put it on my skin somehow... And it was awfully terrible.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t recommend this wax because it melts like a mess. Hard to use because it&#x27;s tooooo sticky even when I take from the can.</li>
    <li> GiGi all purpose honey is a great product and I have been using it since 2012. But I want to discuss both advantages and disadvantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;1. Removes all the hair including facial and private areas.&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantage: If you have a problem with ingrown hairs first try to scrub your area where you want to wax and then apply the wax otherwise its not effective on ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;2.Advantage: Value for money.&lt;br /&gt;3.Disadvantage: If you are using wax warmer try to warm the wax atleast 1 hr prior waxing. Basically you have to plan ahead to go waxing.&lt;br /&gt;4. Disadvantage: The residual wax on your skin is very sticky and hard to remove. The wax remover provided by gigi is not very useful.</li>
    <li> This wax is the best my wife has ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this product for waxing. I have been using it for ten years and it is very sticky and effective. I will continue to order</li>
    <li> Does a good job of waxing but is very difficult to clean up after your done. Skin feel sticky for a day or two even after thorougly washing it with soap and warm water.</li>
    <li> (This Review is Virtually the Same as My Review for Other GiGi Wax):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One jar lasts me at least two full uses of each of the following: half leg, full bikini, underarms, eyebrow/lip; plus several more uses for underarms and eyebrow/lip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does the job well. I have a lot of experience waxing myself, so I can do it with little stickiness or mess. This is the type of product that works based on the user&#x27;s own skills, so if you&#x27;re a novice, you may have trouble using this cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- use a wider piece of muslin than the width of the wax your body-- keeping the edges of the muslin piece clear of wax will make everything mess-free and make it easier to handle for multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;- trace the jar of wax on a paper plate and cut out the hole, then push the plate up to the rim of the jar-- this will help with drips and keep a mess-free warmer and floor/table&lt;br /&gt;- the less wax you have in the jar, the hotter it will be-- let it cool or blow on it to avoid burning yourself</li>
    <li> I was not sure whether to change from Clean and Easy to Gigi. But this is available everywhere and works just as well.  Very nice wax, does the job, removes hairs cleanly, (I use linen cloth not paper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans up with any kind of oil - all similar waxes do.  No need to use wax remover!  Cooking oil, a dull knife, chopsticks, and sometimes a heat gun, is what I use to remove old wax from bathroom floor, walls, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your body, after waxing, rub in cooking oil, and all remaining gobs come off.  This is a good product, effective, and decent value.</li>
    <li> what a mess.  I have been getting waxed professionally for many years and decided to save money and start doing at home.  warmed up my wax in the gigi warmer and waited to warm/ melt.  applied to skin and placed strip and pulled.  NOTHING!  No hair and no wax.  The wax sticks to you.  tried witch hazel and soap/ water and wax just balled up and still didn&#x27;t come off skin.  finally had to use Goo Gone to remove the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;super sticky mess.  save yourself the hassle and just pass on this</li>
    <li> Fast shipment product as described</li>
    <li> It is the most pathetic wax ever. It removed my skin leaving some wax on the skin which caused redness. DO NOT BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Gigi wax kit for yearsss. My aunt was going to throw it out when she got it but instead I took it and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. With her package the wax she got was a Creme wax and it&#x27;s pink. It was almost done so I thought to try out the All Purpose honee for a change to see what it&#x27;s like. Since I bought and I&#x27;ve tried out the All Purpose honee I&#x27;m not switching back to the Creme. This one is pain free in comparison to the pink one! What a relief it is. It also doesn&#x27;t gunk up on the strip like the Creme/pink one or not as quick at least. I usually use it to do my legs and bikini line, I am yet to try a lip wax just been to lazy to try. Bikini waxes are so hard to do yourself when you know it&#x27;s going to be painful but with this one I don&#x27;t feel a thing unless I&#x27;ve finally grown immune to wax pains haha. Great buy I would recommend</li>
    <li> Great product. Just as expected.</li>
    <li> i generally dont write revies but made me write this one. this is a great product when used with GIGI cloth epilating roll. best results</li>
    <li> Best Products.....A++++</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for almost 10 years now. I dont liek the product at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.When I got the package , the wax had leaked. Also it is super sticky,That cause me to bruse myslef at 5 different spots. My wax strips got stuck up on the wax, that ahs neevr happened to me before&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I had to clean myslef up twice with baby oil and take 3 showers to get rid of the stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.Moreover I dropped some wax by mistake on my bathroom floor, and no amtter what I do it does nto come off. I finaly had to scrap it off using a knife ... even though most of it is gone, but when ever i walk around that spot.. I can feel the stickiness...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better get something else. I didnt expect this from a Gigi product. Very Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for 7 years and this stuff is the best. After reading the other reviews I thought I should add a few pointers for first timers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 get it done professionally the first time so you can see how it is done.&lt;br /&gt;#2 buy the GiGi wax off lotion to remove residual was from skin and fingers. (baby oil will work too and is cheeper but it does not smell as good)&lt;br /&gt;#3 Don&#x27;t buy the pre cut muslin fabric strips, you can save a ton of money if you buy a muslin from a fabric store...or go to Walmart for the pre cut muslin fabric and cut it into strips yourself.&lt;br /&gt;#4 You can reuse a strip of fabric several times even with the previous wax on it. Try it!&lt;br /&gt;#5 Wax over a large towel (or fold an old sheet into fourths) so wax doesn&#x27;t accidentally drip on your floor. When you get a few drops on it just throw it in the wash. The wax leaves a stain but all the sticky will come off and you will be able to reuse it over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;#6 I wax once a week. You don&#x27;t need to wait for 6 weeks. I am never completely hair free but any hair I have is soft and hard to see. Even when I used to wait 4-6 weeks between waxing my hair would start growing back in the second week and so it wasn&#x27;t worth the torture of being hairy!</li>
    <li> This product is widely used at salons and there is reason for that: it is a good product.  There are many other brands and types of wax, but this one is reasonably-priced and works well with most types of skin.  Try it on a small patch at first to make sure you are not allergic before use.</li>
    <li> The wax won&#x27;t stick to fine thin hair. Other than that it works great. I use baby oil to remove the excess, and it&#x27;s true that the hair does grow back slower, finer, and thinner</li>
    <li> it works well for its use.  i like the honey wax rather than the other ones that are different colors.</li>
    <li> Very  difficult to do it and very messy , waste of money,that&#x27;s my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Check carefully before you buy this one, or read honest reviews from other sites first</li>
    <li> Horrible wax... It hurts a lot, it is much better to use the hard wax. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Works great, shipping is excellent turn around time.</li>
    <li> its very sticky.. sticks to almost everything.. i used normal almond oil for removing resdue (which is a lot). it never gets off u. it will take long with the oil too to get off you. very messy. atleast sugaring wax is removed easily with water. water never works on this one.</li>
    <li> It smells like coffee and better than pink sticky one and of course cheaper than stores. Happy with it.</li>
    <li> My experience with this wax was awful. First off when I got the wax,the wax all gooped up on the lid, and I didn&#x27;t think I was ever going to get the lid off so I could use it.  I was told by a friend that this wax could be used without the strips, but I found out after I put several strips of wax on that it wasn&#x27;t going to set, it remained sticky and nearly impossible to get off.  I spent nearly two hours with a bottle of vegetable oil trying to get this junk off my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously purchased the hard body wax before this getting the all purpose honee and my experience with it was fabulous.  I could wax anywhere and everywhere with it, with no problems, so I will be going back to it.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  Not too stringy and I use skin so soft to remove any left over wax.</li>
    <li> This left a sticky residue on the skin and The can fell and the wax has never come out! What&#x27;s in it? I checked the list of ingred and wonder how this is passed for use on our skins!</li>
    <li> Next time I will buy something that is easier to work with.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with my gigi warmer. The warmer came with a hard wax and i wanted to try a different wax for my eyebrows. It works great so far. It is way stickier than hard wax and definitley pulls all the hairs including the fine ones. This stuff takes practice to handle. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if you get it everywhere the first couple times of using it. You can use any type of oil to remove it if you have sticky spots on your skin. coconut oil or olive oil work great to remove it. Happy waxing!</li>
    <li> Love it for eyebrows, legs, it is easy to use, warms up in less then 30 mins.  Can be messy but it wax. Though for under arms and more sensitive areas the hard body wax if much more gentle.</li>
    <li> Ok so I got the wax it looks good and all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all the wax was stuck too the lid , I spent 30 minutes with a jumbo craft stick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to scrape as much wax as I could off the lid to put back in the wax container&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after that the lid was a mess still sticky so I just threw it out, I manged to get all the wax off the outside of the can with some baby oil!!! And I just used a plastic baggy and placed it over the top for a replacement lid.( UPDATE : I MANAGED TO SAVE THE LID BUT THERE&#x27;S STILL SOME WAX RESIDUE BUT IT WILL DO )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have  exchanged but there&#x27;s no point because there&#x27;s a 80% chance I think , that this will happen again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stil have alot of wax but I recommend buying wax out the store , maybe the cold weather or maybe it was toppled over so that&#x27;s why wax got stuck to the lid idk but it was a mess!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall ill give it 4 stars , but I haven&#x27;t tried the wax yet so ill update this review after I try it , I&#x27;m waiting on my wax warmer to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I recommend using some type of wax remover , because you can use baby oil but its only effective just a little&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this wax is hard to get  off!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time ill probably order a different brand or go to a beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax update MARCH 20th 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using this for the legs and upper lip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the UNDERARMS NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS :&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s honee and it&#x27;s multi purpose&lt;br /&gt;It does get a lot of hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt; this did not work on my underarms at all&lt;br /&gt;It just stuck to my skin and took 2 days to finally dissolve&lt;br /&gt; I recommend  YOU BUY SOME WAX OFF&lt;br /&gt;Because I tried baby oil didn&#x27;t work :(&lt;br /&gt;Another con , THIS WAX IS EXTREMELY STICKY&lt;br /&gt;LIKE IT WILL STICK TO ANYTHING IN A BAD WAY&lt;br /&gt;I HAD SAT A WAX STRIP ON MY DRESSER TEMPORALLY AND THE WAX STUCK TO MY DRESSER AND WOULD NOT COME OFF :(&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t even come off with water :(&lt;br /&gt;CLEAN UP TAKES FOREVER I&#x27;VE HAD TWO SESSIONS&lt;br /&gt;AND IT TAKES ME 20 MINUTES JUST TO CLEAN UP BECAUSE THE WAX IS SO STICKY AND WON&#x27;T COME OFF&lt;br /&gt;NO MATTER HOW MUCH OIL I USE !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;ALSO THIS WAX DRIES SUPER FAST&lt;br /&gt;AS SOON AS I Put IT ON MY SKIN I literally ONLY HAVE 2 seconds to get the strip on other wise the wax won&#x27;t come off my skin:(&lt;br /&gt;  And the consistency does not last one minute it&#x27;s creamy then even while I&#x27;m trying to apply as fast as I can it will dry up and become hard so I can&#x27;t even wax :(&lt;br /&gt;THIS SHOULD BE HARD WAX , BECAUSE IT GETS HARD&lt;br /&gt;YES I REALIZE YOU HAVE TO BE FAST WHEN WAXING , ( I&#x27;VE BEEN WAXING FOR almost 3 years now)&lt;br /&gt;BUT IM NOT SUPERWOMAN , IT DRIES WAY TOO FAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I will recommend this wax for the legs but other areas I suggest you use a different brand , also if you buy this wax but IF YOU DO BUY Please Im warning you purchase a solution that is for actually removing the wax&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try to use an alternative like baby oil , anyways I&#x27;m going to try a different brand .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY REVIEW!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also sorry for any typos .

    <li> Not the best smelling stuff in the world, but it works well &amp; actually removes my hair (fine as well as coarse).</li>
    <li> im a man with sexy legs thank you</li>
    <li> Wonderful golden colored wax that actually works!  Even got all those little fuzzy hairs that are usually left behind by other waxes.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  After it gets hot turn off and let cool for just a moment to thicken up a bit.  It makes it easier to use.</li>
    <li> Best wax in the world</li>
    <li> One of the best wax I&#x27;ve been buying for year.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that you have to work hard to remove the left over wax. it will not wash off. You have to buy the product by GiGi that helps remove the wax.</li>
    <li> I love gigi wax. Professional and Easy.</li>
    <li> This honey wax is great for waxing my legs. Goes on thin when warm.</li>
    <li> This wax is soooo sticky and messy to work with! I can feel the stickiness through the muslin strips and then my fingers get sticky and prevents me from waxing or handling anything properly and without making a mess. Not worth the trouble!! Before this, I used the Brazilian Hard Wax which is MUCH easier to work with!</li>
    <li> Worst wax ever.. It was horrible experience. It&#x27;s very sticky, it wont go away with water. I cannot even wax properly because it so sticky and very uncomfortable to use. Please don&#x27;t buy and waste your money.</li>
    <li> great for arms legs for a brazilian i still prefer hard wax</li>
    <li> Terrible:( used it and it got all over my floor and I tried everything to get it off. Won&#x27;t come off my skin or floor. And it says wait 30 seconds then pull, that&#x27;s incorrect. I waited 2 minutes and it still wasn&#x27;t dry. So I had to keep ripping the same strip. I had blood drips. Will never use Gigi brand again. The creme wax was 10x worse</li>
    <li> All Purpose Honee (Standard Wax). It gets the job done, and the size, i would say, is the standard size for the GiGi Wax Warmer. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, the wax is a honey-colored wax and takes about 30 minutes to fully heat over (to a liquid), mind you, I&#x27;ve melted it in my GiGi Wax Warmer on High. I&#x27;d also recommend cooling it down to become thicker before applying it so you don&#x27;t get blisters or worse!</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this wax. very sticky. and I got skin rashes. thought I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin I got lot of rashes on my hand and leg. try to by sugar wax. really easy to wash and less painful</li>
    <li> very worst waxing cream. It really get messy when we use it , sticks every where  and does not go off easily .Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Works just like you expect it to. Just don&#x27;t put it on too thick, then it&#x27;s a disaster. Love it!</li>
    <li> Do not buy it in any case! IT is terrible! It is not washed off with water!You can only remove it from your skin!!!</li>
    <li> People who complain make me laugh, if it&#x27;s too weak they complain it doesn&#x27;t work and if it works they complain that it&#x27;s too strong and removed their skin!! hmm one word &amp;#34; go to a salon then.&amp;#34; All I have to say is this is a decent product, it gets the job done and the price is also awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this wax! It does a great job of grabbing hair of all types. It comes off cleanly with little to no residue. Like all waxes ut us VERY sticky; you have to be careful or you&#x27;ll lose more than you planned for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wax (14 oz. can) along with the warmer, muslin strips, and how-to video at a promo price of just under $40 at Sally&#x27;s.  I have dark hair and I&#x27;m a total newbie at waxing.  I think GiGi All Purpose Honee Wax is an excellent product (if you have the right tools) and I highly recommend it.  I found it very effective for hair removal.  The wax warmer is an indispensable tool to achieve the perfect wax consistency.  Yes, the wax does get sticky BUT that is why it is effective at hair removal and YOU CAN&#x27;T EXPECT TO WASH OFF ANY WAX RESIDUE WITH JUST SOAP &amp; WATER!  I think the key to my success as a first-time waxer was PREPARATION.  I watched the how-to video first.  Also, before I started waxing, I had all my tools within reach:  baby powder, lots of applicator sticks, a pair of scissors to cut the muslin into whatever size I needed, GooGone and paper towel to clean up any accidental drips, and I had some azulene oil leftover from my Parissa kit.  The azulene oil was very effective in removing any wax residue from my skin plus it has soothing properties to help minimize any redness.  I worked on my legs and brows first.  I was so pleased with the result that I decided to try waxing my upper lip and my underarms the following the night.  Again, I was so pleased with the result!  I also ended up using only (maybe) 1/10 of the product so I know this can will last me a long time, perhaps close to a year.  This very happy newbie will definitely re-purchase!</li>
    <li> Worked well with the gigi warmer, but as I said in my review of the warmer I think now, that a roller or strips would be better, because getting the backs of your legs with a pot and stick is difficult.</li>
    <li> This is the wax I always come back to. Works well, and comes off pretty easy.</li>
    <li> Honee wax worked better for me. the hard wax would break easily... this is just sometimes hard to get off of your skin if it does not come off on the muslin strips.</li>
    <li> I had tried the Gigi stripless wax before this, but that was not that good. I say this because, I was unable to pull the wax out properly and it was all over my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;This wax is easy to use, and the hair just comes out with one pull. While applying the wax spreads out evenly, and you get nice silky skin in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t put a 5 star for this product is because the wax that remains on your skin is really very very hard to take off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start with a good thing to say about this product: once you spread it on your leg (for example) and take it off it does an excellent job, the hair really comes off completely with just 1 pull, even though not without pain!&lt;br /&gt;But....like so many reviews said, it is SO SO SO sticky!!  I thought people were exaggerating, it probably can&#x27;t be that bad. Worst case, I&#x27;ll use hot water and soap to take it off if it sticks. So I bought it. I was so wrong!! I just finished using it for the first (and last) time. Beside the incomfort of the stickiness during the use it self, which really made the whole process difficult, I had to get back in the shower 4 times (!!!!) to try and take off what was left. Only after drying a little did I realize I am still sticky. So like I said I gave the shower 4 tries. And still I am a little sticky in different places. I jusr gave up cause nothing seems to help. Hopefully with time it&#x27;ll get better.&lt;br /&gt;And of course there is cleaning the surroundings where I used it. Although comparing to my body scrubbing that was much easier.&lt;br /&gt;So I really recommend you NOT to do my mistake and be optimistic and buy it!&lt;br /&gt;Noa</li>
    <li> I used to spend $12 on eyebrows and $8 on upper lip wax services at a salon--and that&#x27;s every 3-4 weeks (sometimes every 2 weeks).  Along with the All Purpose Honee, I purchased the professional warmer.  I love how I can wax in the comfort of my own home and I&#x27;m saving $$.  I have sensitive skin and this has not caused any issues with my face.</li>
    <li> It is not as sticky as azulene, so no mess! But still it needs to be removed from skin with the help of a oil, it does not come out with just water (which is not a feature of honey wax actually). But I am happy because it removes hair very neatly- and without peeling off my skin- which was a big problem with azulene. Moreover it melts faster than azulene in the warmer so saves me some time. I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It received 5 stars for shipping, packaging and how well the product works. We have tried several other types of waxes and found this to be the best. Having black hair this product works the best when removing the hairs. Price is great and we love the GiGi products.</li>
    <li> I used this wax for my underarms and stomach. I left it on a medium heat setting as I was waxing. Did not rip skin as others indicated. But the instructions that were attached to the package came in five different languages except English and I just found that unacceptable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with a wax warmer, collars, and muslin. Buying the roll of muslin is the way to go, and it&#x27;s absolutely necessary for soft wax like this. Without it you&#x27;ll just wind up being a sticky mess, and I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s where a lot of the negative reviews are coming from. A hard wax would do better for bikini and leg waxing, but this is great for finer hair (facial and arm waxing). It just broke off all my leg hair and I&#x27;ll be using hard wax for that next time, but I also have extremely coarse leg hair and I&#x27;m not holding that against the wax. Did a great job on my eyebrows, upper lip, and my husbands back. If you don&#x27;t know how to wax, buy an informational dvd don&#x27;t just wing it!</li>
    <li> First off, it does what it&#x27;s suppose to. I get a really good waxing of my legs with this stuff. BUT.....this stuff is aweful! And not just bad, this stuff is absolutely the worst. They say that glitter is the herpes of the crafting world, well this is the herpes of the waxing world. The absolute only way you have a chance of getting it off your skin is with a big jug of Goo-Be-Gone near by, and that doesn&#x27;t get it all. I have tried everything, and this stuff still manages to stay on my skin and make every possible thing in this world stick to it... Unfortunately, I bought 2 of these. So far I&#x27;ve used half a container, and I&#x27;m never using it again. There&#x27;s so many better waxes out there...STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!</li>
    <li> This works well but be very careful because it gets everywhere and you could end up with a very sticky bathroom!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too sticky that I applied a bit of it on my fingers and it took hours to remove that. And one thing i must admit, if I would have put it on some client&#x27;s legs, that would have been disastrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serious advice. Stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I opened it after a month so I cannot return it but i ordered two different products and both are same quality.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the type of wax or what but I really think my self waxing is less painful than going to a professional. As the jar gets empty remember to turn down the warmer. Not because it will burn you but because it gets really runny and makes it hard to not make a big mess.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few months now and looking forward to trying GiGi&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> This honee is extremely effective. We purchased this months ago and still haven&#x27;t put a dent in the container. My wife absolutely loves this product having been skeptical in the first place. We didn&#x27;t know if it would be too hot, if it would work, or if it was just some gimmick. Well we&#x27;ve had it for a while and it has lived up to everything it says it will do and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes time to get a refill we know where we will be going to make our next purchase and that&#x27;s right here.</li>
    <li> This wax is very cheap does not work well leaves a lot of hairs left behind when waxing</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase it came very quick and I was very pleased</li>
    <li> Why did you choose this rating? After applying Vax to skin it is sticking to sking. Also it is stking to spachola and vax heater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What did you like or dislike?&lt;br /&gt;After applying the heated vax to skin using spachola, vax is not being removed completely from sking and spachola as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you recommend this product to? No No No..........</li>
    <li> Worst wax I have ever used. It&#x27;s so sticky and messy that you can&#x27;t get the wax off your hand even if u wash it for like a hundred times. Thanks to this, I started making wax on my own at home instead of buying such waste products.</li>
    <li> Awful. I&#x27;ve been waxing for years, and I&#x27;ve used just about every type and brand. This is by far and away the worst wax I&#x27;ve ever used. Calling it a &#x27;honee&#x27; wax implies that like most sugar waxes that it washes off with scrubbing and water. I wish. This  stuff gets everywhere, and it is near impossible to get off. Be weary around your furniture. Any remnants on your skin, and trust me, there will be remnants you don&#x27;t even know you have will stick to your furniture and ruin it.. I think I have fairly realistic expectations about a wax and it&#x27;s cleanup. I wish I&#x27;d never bought this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a very good all purpose wax. I use it regularly for waxing legs, arms, bikini and will keep on using/purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waxed my legs before with quite a few waxes, and I can say that GiGi all purpose honey wax is very soft and gentle for my skin. It works for nearly every part on my body, and leaves my skin soft with minimal breakouts. the QUALITY is amazing. ...the only thing about using this wax is that you have to learn how to watch some films or learn from a friend HOW to was yourself, because it IS professional wax.  I would definitely recommend this wax!!!</li>
    <li> Gigi all purpose honee wax works great and gets the job done. there is really no smell to this wax and it was a bit runny for me maybe I had it a little warm!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on anything because I&#x27;m way too lazy but this wax was amazing!!!!!! I really really loved it. Super easy to apply remove the hair and re use the strips.totally worth it.</li>
    <li> This wax is difficult to clean. The Baby oil trick is messy. Sugaring is much better and gentler on skin.</li>
    <li> really good wax, i used an old cut up cotton shirt to make my own wax strips</li>
    <li> I was nervous about getting this as some other reviewers said it was too sticky. But I thought it was perfect! If you watch a few tutorials on waxing before using it, you should have no problems. This is the same stuff my esthetician uses and now I can do it myself. I had great results. I used this on my face and eyebrows and had no problem at all. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it many times and it just sticks to the skin too much no matter how you prepare your skin. And it will remove skin!!  And it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair so you&#x27;re left tweezing or shaving (down there) to clean up what is missed.  I recommend the Azulene over this product.</li>
    <li> Very Sticky, doesn&#x27;t come off skin. Had to dump the whole bottle. Such a waste of money. Not recommended at all</li>
    <li> Some of the reviews are spot on, I had really bad experience with this product. It does take off your hair but it also takes off your skin. It took more then 2 hours to take this wax off my skin.I had the worst experience with this product.</li>
    <li> good product but you should have the cleaner after you use it, if you do not have cleaner you will be in trouble like me</li>
    <li> I find you can never go wrong with any of GiGi products.  Thank you for making at home waxing affordable.</li>
    <li> This is the one of the most sticky Wax i have ever try in my life. I have always use wax when i was in India, i ran out of it in US so i gave a try to GIGI ALL PURPOSE HONEE. OMG What a mistake i made. It does good wax...but to take off that wax from your body it took me 2 hrs and still not completely free from it.&lt;br /&gt;Its also pull my skin on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Never never never buy this please.</li>
    <li> Stuck to my skin and bathroom like honey! didnt wax off one hair... just made my entire bathroom a sticky mess!</li>
    <li> way too sticky and very messy ..&lt;br /&gt;It rips more skin out than it does hair ..&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Horrible horrible product!! It&#x27;s not wax, it&#x27;s industrial glue. I died removing it from my skin. Worst experience ever. Please do not buy this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years now. One tub of it lasts for a good while. It might seem like it is messy but just use any oil afterwards to clean it up off the skin. Use the techniques given by others to use it and I am sure you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> As always, good quality wax to use at home.</li>
    <li> too sticky, once on the strips, its non washable</li>
    <li> Wax works perfectly. But very upset that it came banged up, making it very difficult to use &amp; had wax every where in the box and on the container.</li>
    <li> Good wax, but very sticky</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok wax, but misses some of the finer hairs when I&#x27;ve used it. I think it&#x27;s great if you like using waxing strips, but I prefer hard wax personally.</li>
    <li> it like chewing gum...once u apply it,its so hard to remove it...so very sticky.......it ruined my shorts as well....horrible exp</li>
    <li> Use the Honee wax on legs and arms. Pre treat area with baby POWDER. You can re use your muslin strips a few times.  The Brazilian hard wax is best for bikini, lip and underarms. No muslin needed  When using the Brazilian hard wax, Pre treat are with a thin layer of baby OIL.</li>
    <li> worst wax ever!  I have been using dipilatory wax for almost 60 years; my mom started me as a kid.  I recently bought the GiGi wax warmer because I needed a new one.  IT&#x27;s fine, BUT my current wax didn&#x27;t fit in the warmer.  The instructions say it will hold a regular 14 oz. container of wax.  So, I bought the GiGi All Purpose Honee, getting the special two cans.  I had no idea it was soft until I tried to use it.  i made my own strips, but there&#x27;s that soft wax all over the place.  I&#x27;ve been washing my hands with alcohol and it still doesn&#x27;t come off.  There should have been a notice that this stuff is SOFT and doesn&#x27;t harden.  I hate it.  Now, I&#x27;m supposed to buy new hard wax and throw out the two cans I have?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I just got some of that wax on my mouse!!!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find that this wax is NOT water soluble, but I was lucky to have a big bottle of baby oil within reach. I gave it five stars despite this because it removes EVERYTHING. I am a combination of all the ethnicities that carry the trait of thick, dark, coarse hair, and after 5 years of searching, I have finally found a wax to match my hair. If you decide to make this your go-to wax, then purchase a large bottle of baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the fact that the melting point of this wax is low compared to others, so the wax is not that hot when you put it on your skin. Because the liquid form of this wax is much more tolerable, you use less wax, thus, your money goes further with this wax.</li>
    <li> I just love this wax. It melts quick, not toooo sticky, easy to apply, and less messy.&lt;br /&gt;I had a very bad experience with the sally hansen microwavable body wax. It a pain to melt that wax and i had to take a few laps to the microwave coz it cools down fast. It sticks everywhere and was a total mess. Waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product is awesome..I also bought a wax warmer along with this.. Both works great for me.. saves time and properly pulls out d hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> This wax is really strong! I do like how adhesive it is, but I have a few stripes on my legs from forcefully ripping up some skin that the wax wasn&#x27;t ready to part with. Nothing terrible, no blood was shed, but man did it hurt more than it should have! Clean up was tough too. I&#x27;ve used lots of different kinds of waxes and most of them come off in the shower pretty easily. Not this one. I had to use baby oil in order to eradicate my skin of the excess wax. All in all, good wax, bad side effects.</li>
    <li> This was the absolute worst wax that I have ever, ever had! It is a big, sticky mess! It got all over my hands, and whats worse, it didn&#x27;t even come off of my eyebrows! I had to scrub at the wax (I tried every method out there) and yet, nothing worked. Very, very disappointed. Will never try this brand again. I strongly DO NOT recommend this wax.</li>
    <li> I got this wax based on other high eviews to do my waxing at home. Works very well, easy to use, etc...</li>
    <li> company was great in sending etc. just do not like the product</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have experience with wax, I don&#x27;t recommned you this wax is toooooo sticky. Is almost impossible leave the place clean. If you touch the wax with your hands, now you are in serious troubles.!!! After 3 times of use you can have more experiencie and make a good job. But you will suffer the first times. I thought that take a shower the problem is gone. But nooo only if you apply cream a lot.&lt;br /&gt;ps: sorry for the english i dont speak the language.</li>
    <li> This wax is awesome. It does not break me out and has never been too rough with my skin. I recommend this one, especially for starters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to get the GiGi Wax Warmer, applicator sticks, and the wax strips with it! Trust me, they will all pay for themselves after  uses.</li>
    <li> My favorite waxing, easy and quickly process, I can believe I used to spend a lot money in waxing, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Gooey, sticky and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> The cans came dented and the wax was all over the outside of the rim lid causing a wax mess to clean up when melting in my wax er. Looks like damaged cans being resold. I had them too long to return them!</li>
    <li> After trying many kinds of wax, decided this is the best. You may be able to get it cheaper at sally beauty if there&#x27;s a sale.</li>
    <li> This product works well, have been using it for some time. I would not consider changing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this stuff nearly as much as I like the Gigi creme (the pink stuff) that my warmer came with. It definitely does the job, but I like how my skin feels after the creme much better. I have also only used the Honee on my legs and bikini area, so I cannot speak to how it would do on the face or anywhere else. I would use this if I&#x27;m in a pinch, but its not my first choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing myself for years and this is the only wax I use.</li>
    <li> For starters I&#x27;m a newbie. I bought GiGi&#x27;s wax 3 days ago and I&#x27;m now obsessed with waxing my body. The first day was awful I applied the wax without the PreHon which is a product that prevents the wax from sticking to your skin. After that day I&#x27;ve used the PreHon and I must say I love this product. It also makes waxing a painless experience. You SHOULD TRY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> This wax is perfect for me. It does not overheat, it&#x27;s not too sticky. Just right. Other waxes like sugar wax overheat too quickly and can burn your skin. Soy wax just does not take hair off, you have to go over the same spot too many times, that&#x27;s not safe. I do not have super coarse hair but it&#x27;s not invisible either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip: after waxing apply &amp;#34;azulene&amp;#34; oil to take off excess wax and prevent irratation, leave for a few minutes, wash it off and if you have any kind of anti acne medication like salicic acid or benzoil peroxide put that on too instead of your regular lotion. It helps with the whit bumps or redness irratation. you may have to do it for 2 days, depends how sensitve your skin. DO NOT do the same or use this wax for &amp;#34;brazilian wax&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> works great.  very sticky.  need to purchase baby oil and powder for easy clean up.</li>
    <li> Because it has a metal container, I can heat it up directly on the stove. I like it. I like it better than the cold ones.</li>
    <li> The basic function of a wax is to remove hair, which this one also did. But with the hair removal came everything else.&lt;br /&gt;1- My bathroom became a sticky mess&lt;br /&gt;2- I became a sticky mess. I used up the whole wax remover oil but nothing happened. I have been waxing myself for the past 15 years but I have never hurt myself. This one just pulled off my skin from the upper thigh :(&lt;br /&gt;3- Even after a shower and lots of wax remover oil, olive oil, body butter, and cold cream, my body is still sticky. Yuck yuck yuck!!&lt;br /&gt;I am throwing this rightaway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst wax I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck!!</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 10 years and it used to be great. But, it seems as though the formulation has changed, and it&#x27;s now awful.  Never dries/hardens as it should, has an odd tackiness/stickiness, doesn&#x27;t grab thicker hairs, and not only stays on your skin, but damages it, Gigi has officially lost my business.</li>
    <li> Item as described. I use this wax regularly. Lasts up to 5/6 waxing sessions.</li>
    <li> I had my brows waxed at Ulta (cosmetic and aesthetics store) and while I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I did break out. I waxed my brows at home with this wax and found it to be less painful, easy to apply and no breakouts!</li>
    <li> I really like using the honey but it doesn&#x27;t take off all the hair. My salon uses it too, so I just have to tweeze whatever is left behind.Just make sure to keep baby oil handy for any left over wax.</li>
    <li> I was looking for Gigi Dark Honee and I bought this product instead after reading reviews. Although some people mentioned its good for coarse hair, I have to strongly disagree. This is NOTHING comparable to dark honee. Its very messy, even after cleaning it leaves bumps of wax, which is probably true with any honey wax I believe, but I was so used to the clean and thin texture for dark honee that I found this one really messy. To sum it up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not good for coarse hair&lt;br /&gt;- Very messy&lt;br /&gt;- Dries very fast, so you have to apply and remove immediately which makes waxing process less efficient and time consuming&lt;br /&gt;- sometime leaves a whole chunk of wax on the skin when you pull the strip (havent figured out why and it can drive you nuts!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldnt recommend at all. - I dont see why anyone would use a lower quality product when there is a better one (dark honee) out there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too sticky...doesn&#x27;t go off easily....you need to rub constantly to get rid of it..</li>
    <li> Talk about money saving. This is the kind of wax you need the Honee wax, they also sell this other &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; that looks like pink marshmallow fluff. I DO NOT recommend that. This is what you need. I&#x27;ve been using Gigi since I was 19. I&#x27;m 27. I am a customer for life. Quality products.</li>
    <li> Pretty painful wax and wasn&#x27;t that great at removing hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not worth the hassle.  It&lt;br /&gt;makes a giant mess and sticks to EVERYTHING!!  Buy the Gigi Hard wax instead.  It works way better and has half the mess.</li>
    <li> I order it and came earlier than expected. The product is very easy to use and has clear instructions. It is not messy at all and comes out very easy with the stripes. If for any reason you need it to remove it comes out very easy with baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;After using it over my legs it left a very smooth surface over the skin. I have very sensitive skin and for the first time I have found a product that is good to remove my coarse hair and delicate at the same time for my skin. I can give this product a 10 star</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for years and I have never encountered a wax as messy as this. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works great and removes the hair well. I have dark, coarse hair in some areas and it rips that stuff out with one pass. It worked for my legs, arms, and was gentle enough for my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I had a heck of a time just getting the container open because it was practically glued shut. This stuff is horribly sticky and a nightmare to clean up. I would suggest having an oil or some wax remover on hand for clean up for went you get it on your hands or if it drips anywhere. And it will drip. It&#x27;s a thinner wax so it will be messy. I prefer a wax you have more control over and I would not recommend this for a beginner. Start with a cream wax.</li>
    <li> Love this wax. Just be careful with how sticky it is :)</li>
    <li> I took cosmetology and this wax is the kind we used for waxing eyebrows &amp; upper lip. It&#x27;s gentle on skin and can be easily remover from skin with gigi wax off lotion and removed from surfaces with goo gone</li>
    <li> Ordered it for a classmate who was a bit of a busy bee and could never find the time to go to a store.  She&#x27;s big into summer dresses and short sleeves so she loves it.  She&#x27;s told me the pain is now minimal or almost none for her as she is used to it.  It stung a little bit the first few times she did her arms and legs but it doesn&#x27;t bother her anymore</li>
    <li> I usually buy the wax from a local beauty supply store, I just got this online because I needed my order to be above $30 for free shipping. The product in general is good but it was sticky (as in it leaked out of the container) when I got it so I was annoyed. But Gigi wax products are very good.</li>
    <li> If you have to wax go with this one. It works. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years. I&#x27;ve tried others and go back to this one. Great product</li>
    <li> This is really sticky and without the wax remover it NEVER would have come off my face! I would not recommend this wax. Using the GiGi wax warmer it takes at least an hour to completely melt to even try to use.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not good for lip and eyebrow. Buy the hard wax, you won&#x27;t need strips, easy to apply and remove. I think this is more for legs or large surface areas.</li>
    <li> Love this wax. It is the only one I used!</li>
    <li> Maybe this works better on thicker or darker hair. I have very fine blonde hair so does my daughter. It didn&#x27;t work at all. It is however a night mare to remove from skin and gets all over everything. Baby oil will remove it eventually but takes a lot of effort and time. I love the hard wax for under arms and face. I&#x27;ll just stick to shaving my legs this is far more work than i&#x27;m willing to put in.</li>
    <li> This brand is my go to brand of home waxing products. They work so well, good pricing, and help me save so much money by waxing at home.</li>
    <li> Please dont even think to buy it.If you already purchased it then throw it in dustbin when you  got it.Its really messy.i have wasted my whole day to remove excess wax.</li>
    <li> Wax is great and works well; however, it is very sticky and does its job well.  First time i used it I had sticky wax everywhere but It was simple to get it off my hands by simply placing vaseline on my hands</li>
    <li> I am currently attending college for cosmetology. This is the exact wax we use in our salon along with the GiGi wax warmer style , it works very well. It isn&#x27;t messy as long as you know how to use it. As far as coming off of skin, with the GiGi wax remover for skin works perfectly. Also of you do make a mess buy goo gone, it works wonders. Just spray it on spills, leave to soak for about 10 minutes, wipe and should be off.  I promise this WILL give you salon results. All of our clients love this stuff. Also never buy peral wax. That type of wax sucks.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product !!</li>
    <li> As always GiGi waxes are great. I prefer the blue wax over the Honee. But all GiGi waxes are 5 STARS</li>
    <li> Great product for use on fine hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it for bikini waxing unless your hair is fine. I would recommend using the hard wax for diy bikini waxing on coarse hair</li>
    <li> Good price but cans were dented and leaking from the top when received.</li>
    <li> Horrible and sticky. I wish I would have read followed the negative reviews. I have been wax for 13 years and never had something so sticky. By the sole acting of opening the box end grabbing the can, my fingers were completely sticky.</li>
    <li> i love it very nice one</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t do it! I&#x27;m college educated and fairly handy thought this would be easy peasy....well....not for me it wasn&#x27;t! One try and I&#x27;m out!  I&#x27;ll continue to pay for the services. At least I tried.....</li>
    <li> Came extremely fast and as described</li>
    <li> Always a pain, but great wax</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and is for the most part easy to clean. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This wax is impossible to get off. I tried using the gigi wax remover product, which was laughably ineffective. I tried using goo gone, but it couldn&#x27;t get all of it off. This wax ruined my wax warmer because it got all over it and was impossible to remove. Also, I have sensitive skin so it is usually red after waxing, but with this wax there was a few times it just tore off enough skin to make scabs. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wax for any reason at all. Gigi should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> I will not use any other brand. Consistency of the wax is excellent, no reactions with my skin, and is suitable for every body region.</li>
    <li> Its a little sticky. I havent tried any other waxes so i cant say its the best, but it got the job done.</li>
    <li> I had tried other waxes but they always left random splotches of hairs all over the place. Unfortunately, my hairs grow back in a week. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the wax though. My hairs are just stronger. Or probably zombies. I&#x27;ll go with zombie hairs.</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me. It removed all the hair, mind u I have thick black hair so being that it worked is supurb. The shipping was very fast i ordered the gigi warmer with this product too. Great investment i think!</li>
    <li> I went to school for Cosmetology and in school we used this brand but I would always have serious redness after waxing that would last a couple hours... I&#x27;m not sure that we were using this exact TYPE but we must not have been because there is barely any redness associated with using this wax and it comes off so clean with Gigi muslin strips and a prewax oil (or my favorite, baby powder).</li>
    <li> i bought the gigi wax kit, that came with a different kind of was.&lt;br /&gt;this was was too liquid, it drip too much. i preferred the one that come with the kit</li>
</ol>
