<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not terribly effective, and unwieldy.  Save your money, this product was a waste for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x60;s pefect machine)) Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> Seems to clean the teeth, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Holds far too little water. I had to refill halfway through.&lt;br /&gt;- The battery doesn&#x27;t last. My Sonicare brushes have gone strong for years and years. This thing didn&#x27;t make it to two.</li>
    <li> I have periodontal disease and have struggled  for 40 years with flossing and picking, deep cleanings at the dentist office and even some gum surgery to try to maintain my gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago I bought the Airflosser at my dentists office on their recommendation. Since then my periodontal problem has all but gone away and I no longer use dental floss (which I hate). My gums no longer bleed and my hygienist of 20 years says my gums have never been better.&lt;br /&gt;The battery stays charged for about 2 weeks of use (once daily) when traveling and the only problem I have had is broken stems and some leaking where the stem mounts to the base which I cured with a couple of wraps of plumbers teflon tape. Also sometimes a vacuum lock develops in the water tank which restricts the flow of water but a quick opening of the fill port fixes that.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Airfloss seems to be effective overall and easily removes food particles from between one&#x27;s teeth.  I use mine with a mouthwash to help fight gingivitis.  My only complaints are ergonomic issues: First, I find it impossible to fill the fluid chamber without fluid seeping out after closing the chamber cover - I have to wipe-off the handle area afterward, otherwise it makes a mess.  A small vent, properly placed, would help.  Second, it&#x27;s rather tedious to plant the unit back onto it&#x27;s charging base - requires a bit of hunting to engage the mating features.  A simple, curved, backstop molded into the base would have alleviated this minor nuisance.  Other than these two issues, I&#x27;m pleased with the results so far.</li>
    <li> I just got off the phone with a guy at Philips. After almost 2 years the air flosser just made a horrible noise that I&#x27;ll call juddering and nothing came out. He had me run it under hot water several times and eventually I could release the head and it started working again. I was convinced it was a mechanical problem but apparently it was just my habit of using Listerine which clogged the pump. Using just water from now on. Giving 4 stars because it will clog, otherwise I love it.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed you still need to floss with dental floss. It would be nice if it had a case to store or travel with.</li>
    <li> I have been using a WaterPic for years and I didn&#x27;t know if  was going to like the change.  Once I got use to it I found it was impossible to go back to the old method.  Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Battery would not recharge after 2 years and 6 months.  I would say that if fine after I have read reviews of competing products</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve redesigned the airfloss to deliver less power.  If you have tight spaces between your teeth you&#x27;ll notice the difference in penetration.  I&#x27;ve noticed this both new ones I purchased.  Sad that the mfg needed to save money this way.</li>
    <li> The product literature claims that this product \\&quot;Removes 99% more plaque biofilm between teeth than brushing with manual toothbrush alone\\&quot; and \\&quot;Gently and effectively helps improve interproximal gum health in just two weeks\\&quot;. While those may well be true, they don&#x27;t mention how much better or worse it is when compared to flossing, so I decided to try it myself. After getting used to the Airfloss for a week such that I was no longer causing water to spray all over the mirror and counter top; I brushed my teeth, used the Airfloss and then flossed afterwards. The result was the floss still removed a significant amount of food particles. I&#x27;m guessing the majority of it came from between the teeth as opposed to between the teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I&#x27;ve been told by my dentist that I have \\&quot;tight contact\\&quot; between my molars so your experience may be different. However, I tried this experiment on several different occasions after having had a variety of meals throughout the day (meats, vegetables, popcorn, etc.) and on every occasion the Airfloss just didn&#x27;t seem to do a complete job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all types of floss and flossers out there that make it easy to reach the back teeth, get around braces and other dental hardware e.g. [[ASIN:B000GGJCM0 Gum Soft Picks]] I don&#x27;t see any reason to spend so much money on something that doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> I have practiced dental hyg. for 33 yrs.  I just tried this new product (AirFloss) to see if I would recommend it to my patients. Bottom line, IT DOES NOT WORK!!  I would never tell my patient that this product is worth the price for what it claims.  Shame on such a good company like Sonicare for putting this out and tell the dental community that this is for our patients who do not floss.  This does nothing for the health of the mouth...and the price, what were they thinking??? This is the first time I have ever written on review on anything, but I feel so strongly about it.

    <li> I brush and floss my teeth the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; way to fine result.  I tried using this device to see if it would act as a replacement for flossing and found it simply wasn&#x27;t as effective nor was it easier to use.  I then struggled with the device hoping it would at least be a replacement for my old Braun Oxyjet [for flossing and cleaning below the gum line] that is no longer manufactured.  The Philips makes more of a mess than the Oxyjet, it is at best only useful for cleaning below the gum line and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it actually does it.  It is also clumsy to use because you have to click the top of the body each time you want it to pulse, and, the jet is very short so aiming it for the area between the teeth and below the gum line is nearly impossible.  So, in short i cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> Right now flosser is dead will not take a charge what are my options. I have used Philips products for years, hair trimmer,  electric razor.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this item and uses it a couple of times a day.  I find it too strong and somewhat painful as it blasts between the teeth.  You have to remember not to put your tongue behind the blast or it stings with each burst.</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas this year.  I got all excited and then .... in the end I think the Water Pic does a better job.  If you don&#x27;t keep your lips closed at all times - water goes all over the walls, mirror etc.  Annoying!  Since you are told to do only on the outside of the teeth ... ?  Sorry, simply not worth at all the money.  The new Phillips tooth brush is worth it though.  Expensive but worth it (if only they had put the cleaning levels on the opposite side of the handle so you could see which you were at it would have been handy!).</li>
    <li> I was very excited to buy this product. I am not a strong flosser.  I also am in the dental field so i was happy to get the dental personell  discount. Even with the cheaper rate i regret paying the money i paid for  this device. It does not spray hard enough to get the food inbetween your teeth.  Try a waterpick for all of you looking for another flossing method.</li>
    <li> What an excellent product!  I have always had trouble flossing because of arthritis.  Recently I had some pricey dental work done which required me to floss even more diligently than before.  I was in a panic!  I found the Philips Sonicare Electric Flosser with lots of research; it looked promising, so I added it to my usual regimine of the Philips Electric Toothbrush and a Water Pik.  Oh boy!  Today I had my first cleaning.  My hygienist was extremely pleased!  I asked her for an honest assessment, and she said, \\&quot;This gadget obviously did an excellent job on you.  Your teeth are extremely clean, with very little soft plaque build-up and just light staining from the coffee you drink.  I&#x27;m very pleased. Keep doing what you&#x27;re doing.\\&quot;  Calling this a \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; is incorrect, however.  This is an excellent product which delivers what it promises.  Thank you, Philips.</li>
    <li> The product&#x27;s effectiveness is still pending.  I am not sure that this method of flossing is as effective as using real floss.  I will wait until my next visit to the dentist to see what he says.  You do have to be careful using it as the water sprays when using the airflosser - messes up the mirror.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this item I was very excited to see a new liquid flosser.  I was especially excited that Sonicare was making it since I absolutely love their toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unboxing was nice but I got worried when I read the instructions to find out it only holds enough liquid for two uses (holds like two tbsps).  After charging I went for my first run.  When you press the burst button, a motor builds up pressure and after a second bursts liquid out of the nozzle which is placed near the gums between the gaps of your teeth  I don&#x27;t know if my teeth are too close together but for the most part all I got was a face and sink full of spray as the pressure was not high enough to penetrate the gap between my teeth.  After brushing I decided to also use my good old floss to see what if anything was left behind.  It was like I didn&#x27;t floss at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t already throw away the packaging for this I would have returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from my dental hygienist who recommended it.  I had some gum pockets on my rear molars during my 6 month checkups even though I flossed every day.  She felt that a water pick appliance would help and recommended this one as it was a lot less messy to use than the traditional waterpicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion is this product should really be used in conjunction with flossing and not as a replacement for.  I just don&#x27;t think it works good enough to replace flossing.  If you don&#x27;t floss at all I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s better than nothing - but I feel it really should be used in conjunction with daily flossing.  After using it for the last 4 months my dental check up was much improved with no gum pockets found. The only thing I did differently from the last checkup was using the Airfloss.  Again - I still floss.  Many times it does remove more debris than flossing alone.  My routine is I use regular floss, then rinse with a fluoride mouthwash, then use the air floss, then use the electric toothbrush to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I find it is a pretty decent product.  It takes a little while to get used to but once you do, it is quite quick and easy.  I typically find certain teeth are closer together than others and require multiple bursts to get the liquid through. Don&#x27;t be afraid to blast between teeth multiple times.  I typically blast three to four times in between my back molars.  I use a chlorine based mouthwash that works quite well in the Airfloss.  My only complaint, (as others have pointed out) is the liquid capacity is too small.  It&#x27;s not a big deal; I just refill it after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found I can easily go almost two weeks between charges. I have a Sensonic \\&quot;E&#x27; serise electric tooth brush, (also a Phillips product) and can charge the Airfloss on the same charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things I would like to see improved.  #1. I would like to see a way to adjust the pressure.  (In order to get more pressure through tight teeth spaces) and I would like to see the liquid capacity increased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this, I highly recommend this product.  It has made my gums much healthier with regular use.  I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last, but I figure if I get a year out of it, the benefits far out weigh the cost of replacing it each year.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this item because you will be very disappointed, as was I.  This electric \\&quot;flosser\\&quot; does not qualify as even a toy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to properly floss, with this product it&#x27;s EASY!!  Fill with mouthwash and it cleans between teeth and freshens your mouth at the same time!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item in June 2012 and have used the coupon rebate of $10. Philips has not sent the check. The product is as bad as it gets. Now, six months later, it does not charge anymore. Do not buy!!!  Second review: It&#x27;s June 2013, this is the second time that the product stops working (ON/OFF button not functioning). After waiting half hour on the phone I get an order for the third replacement in one year. Third review: bought one pair from costco. Both  flossers Broke down.</li>
    <li> Had one before and it improved&lt;br /&gt;my gum health greatly. Would&lt;br /&gt;recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very good and easy to use product. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be very effective. I have never done a good job using dental floss as evidenced by the fact I had four cavities at my last dental checkup. This product is easy to use and seems to do the same job as dental floss. I can see the evidence after rinsing my mouth. The unit must be charged before using. I have found that one charge covers several uses. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has difficulty with effectively using dental floss.</li>
    <li> Ok so i got the airfloss device from a dental hygienist i used to work with, she picked up a few extra at a dental convention. after watching videos on youtube, reading reviews here on amazon and also using it myself, i feel it would be helpful to say this... If you are already a faithful and diligent flosser, do not stop your flossing! This item is not as effective as daily flossing, but in a world where  most people dont floss or dont floss correctly, this can be quite helpful, especially if used with a mouth rinse or flouridde in the evening before bed. The product works well at loosening plaque but can have some difficulty removing larger pieces of food. I suggest using this first with a mouthwash, then brushing. My mouth does feel cleaner and healthier, as a sporadic flosser this will improve my oral health, but it is not a substitute for flossing. One more word of advice, it takes a few days to learn not to spray your mirror, etc... (practice the first time with water, and always turn it off as soon as you take it out of your mouth to prevent accidental firing). also if you dont line it up correctly it may misfire (spray out of your mouth), or not fire. A correct firing will shoot through your teeth and to the middle of your mouth to your tongue, if you didnt get a good result, reposition it and refire until you do. after a week, you will know how to use it with your mouth, which teeth need different angles, etc... Good luck and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my adult son who doesn&#x27;t want to floss, because he says it&#x27;s too hard to get floss between his teeth. He cares about his dental hygiene and does everything else he can, but has been a stubborn holdout about flossing. I asked him if he was willing to try it and he was enthusiastic about it, so I bought it for him. He&#x27;s been using it for a few weeks now and he LOVES it. He uses it everyday and often several times a day. I don&#x27;t know if this device can be a replacement for regular flossing for those who floss, but it&#x27;s certainly way better than no flossing at all for those who don&#x27;t floss.     His girlfriend wanted to try it and now she&#x27;s a regular user, too. His close friend saw it in the bathroom and asked about it. After he heard what it was and how much my son likes it, he decided to buy one for himself.</li>
    <li> I saw a pop up ad for this, and as I love my sonicare toothbrush and won&#x27;t leave home without it, I was game for buying another expensive item that would take up space on the bathroom counter and need at least some plug-in time.    I have some tight spaces, and I also have a small mouth...reaching in the far back to get behind my last molar is nearly impossible, and this does allow getting way in back...but....I too took notice that when I flossed after using it, I did take something away that the airflosser had not.  The fact that the company offered a money back guarantee if you used it for 28 days convinced me to give it a try.  The support team via telephone was very helpful.  I wanted to know if I could put a saltwater solution in the compartment and this was ok I was told.    Flossing is a hassle and a drag...and this does seem to go more quickly, though I&#x27;m not crazy about the sound, and having to refill the compartment...but I like the way it reaches to the back which is a challenge with floss.  Although my adjusting to the toothbrush and learning how not to splash seemed easier compared to this.  Water runs out of my mouth, and I have spritzed the mirror making for more work...I WANT to like this gadget...and I think I&#x27;m going to call Bed, Bath and Beyond or the sonicare people to see if I could have an extension on my trial...and I am also going to read the professional articles to see how tested this was.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I wish I could say something nice about this product - but - it just does about nothing to clean between your teeth. You have to push for every pusle. It blows a bit of air and a very slight amount of water - not enough to do anything. I have always used the water pik, which sends a blast of water pulses and really does clean.  Amazon was very nice and gave me a full refund.</li>
    <li> After using the device for about a week, I noticed that my gums were very red.  No other changes were made to dental hygiene routine.  I used it a couple of times a day until I discovered the very red gums. I have stopped using it and I may use it occasionally. I will probably ask Phillips to get my money back.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004Y9AINC Philips Sonicare HX8111/02 Airfloss]]Item came with only one Nozzle, but came with offer  for 15% off 1st order thru Philips online -- Only place to get extra nozzles online is thru Amazon NOT Philips - What&#x27;s up with this?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wearing braces and it&#x27;s awfully difficult to floss with braces on.  This little thing does the magic!  I use it almost after every meal.  Only takes 1-2 minutes to clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have any gum bleeding or other issues, apart from the first-time sprays of my mirror.  I use it a lot more often than I ever flossed.  I purchased a water bottle with a pull-top to refill the unit.  Pouring from a mouthwash container with a safety lid was a pain.  It seals fine, but if you fill it too much, a little can seep out.  I don&#x27;t understand what the problem is, you&#x27;re over the sink anyway.  I rinse everything, and charge once a week or so.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Purchased on the advice of our dentist, and could not find a less effective flossing product if I tried. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have a history of gingivitas and need to get my teeth cleaned 3x a year by a hygenist.  The third cleaning is not covered by my insurance so if the AirFloss can get me back to two cleaning a year, it would be well worth it.  I decided to give it a shot because I had a 20% off coupon from Bed &amp; Bath and they were also offering a $10 mail-in rebate; it end up costing me $62.  I was hoping it would break the hard tarter that forms around the gum line if you don&#x27;t floss often, no way.  But I&#x27;m not going to deduct points for that because it never claim it would do that.  Next I was hoping I would enjoy using it more then flossing and would use it often enough to prevent tarter buildup, and it would work better then flossing.  No on both accounts.  First, as many people claim, it&#x27;s not effective in tight spaces between teeth, but does work well where there is some space, but no better then flossing.  It will dislodge food where there&#x27;s space between the teeth, but remember it will not break up tarter that formed around the gum.  Even if it did work well in tight spaces, I don&#x27;t see why you use it instead of flossing.  It&#x27;s no easier or quicker.  If maybe it cost like $29.99, it might be worth it, you would save on the cost of floss.  But $80 or even $62 I spent, not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Sonicare has done it again with a really great product. I do not floss enough because it&#x27;s a pain to do with regular flossing string, this thing is way easy and way cool! I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and have flossed more in this week due to it&#x27;s ease of use and fresh feeling it gives my mouth. It&#x27;s gentle, but powerful, it thoroughly cleans, but no \\&quot;blood letting\\&quot; you sometimes get with regular floss.  In the past I tried a water pick, this is different and far superior. Small footprint on my sink, no hose and very simple. 2 thumbs up!</li>
    <li> My gums tend to get nasty quickly, even with flossing/brushing on a regular basis, so I&#x27;m always on the look out for new gadgets to try to keep ahead of the gingivitis fight. I&#x27;ve never liked floss  due to the tight gaps between some of my teeth, though the small handled flossers have been my choice for the past couple of years. I&#x27;ve tried water flossers, but they are just too messy and time consuming. So of course when I saw this, I jumped on the pre-order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The function is very simple - turn on, place the tip between your teeth, and fire away. For each push of the button, a burst of air and water blasts through your gumline. The water reservoir holds just a small amount of water, and is good for at least two full \\&quot;flossings.\\&quot; Learning where/how to position the tip for each tooth-gap is something you&#x27;ll figure out in short time - if you don&#x27;t have the tip in the right spot, you&#x27;ll feel the air/water burst kind of \\&quot;back up\\&quot; in the tube, and basically \\&quot;fizzle\\&quot; out as it releases at the tip. With a little work, I&#x27;m able to find a good spot for all of my teeth to ensure a good blast of flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To test the effectiveness, I used the Airfloss after eating a good portion of steak, since particles of the steak tend to wedge tightly between my teeth. The Airfloss was able to dislodge the particles and clean out between my teeth pretty well, though some spots required more than one burst. Afterwards, I ran a handled flosser through my teeth to check, and there was very little leftover matter for the flosser to remove. I&#x27;d say the Airfloss was just as effective as the handled flosser, and easier to use since just a push or two of the button did the work. For regular morning/evening flossing, a single press is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be interested to use this for a full period between professional cleanings, to see if there is any noticeable difference in my gum health from the Airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update 8/27/2011**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that I tend to follow the Airfloss tip with my tongue on the back-side of my teeth. This decreases effectiveness of the Airfloss, as it holds in any particulate that might get blown out the back of your teeth/gums. I&#x27;ve noticed much improved results when keeping my tongue away from where I&#x27;m using the Airfloss. A good \\&quot;blast\\&quot; from the Airfloss should be felt on the other side of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Requires little water.&lt;br /&gt;Very portable.&lt;br /&gt;No need to stick your fingers in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Not messy like a water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a bit of experimentation to find optimal spots.&lt;br /&gt;Will splatter the area/mirror if you don&#x27;t close your mouth while using!e on the back-side of my teeth.

    <li> This works best for my back teeth. In the front teeth, it makes a seal and shoots water sideways.  I talked to my dentist about it and we both agreed that it&#x27;s better than not flossing at all but flossing is better than this.    The packaging and the instructions always have an asterisk and the asterisk says \\&quot;compared to manual toothbrush\\&quot; so none of the claims it makes are worth anything.    I do use it when I don&#x27;t floss (I really hate flossing), and I can only recommend it if nothing will make you floss: It&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Love the Airfloss. Works great. My dentist loves the results too.  I received the Airfloss on time and in good condition. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have a Hydrofloss with the tank but it is impossible to travel with. So, when I saw they where brining out a model I could travel with, I thought great. Well, not so create. I wish I had sent it back now. It lacks any power spraying the would clean between the teath. But I still highly recommend the Hydrofloss with the tank. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> Many of the negative reviews I am reading are of faithful flossers who thought the AirFloss would improve upon the string kind.  From what I can see, this is a misunderstanding of those for which this device is intended.  I have a mouth of closely-spaced teeth, and it has always been painful and awkward to floss.  So - being pain-averse and somewhat lazy - I have never gotten into the habit.  I do brush faithfully, but at every dental appointment for over 30 years I have had to endure a lecture on why I should floss, while knowing I never would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AirFloss is made for people like me!  The device blasts food particles from between the teeth WITHOUT causing any pain or getting stuck during the flossing process.  While I have never been able to make myself use the string-style floss for more than a day at a time, I have been faithfully air flossing every day since I got the device.  It is easy to use, painless, and I feel like George Jetson using it.  The proof of its effectiveness was my last hygienist appointment - the dentist was amazed at how clean everything was, how there was no gum irritation at the end, and how there was absolutely nothing on the string when the hygienist flossed my teeth herself.  It&#x27;s my best appointment since I first came to that office over 30 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re  reluctant flosser like me, this is the device for you.  If you&#x27;re already a faithful flosser, don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Some are reporting failures after only a few weeks. I have been using mine for 3 months now without any issues.)</li>
    <li> I give the Airfloss 2 stars because using Airfloss is better than not flossing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not enjoy flossing and I love Sonicare&#x27;s toothbrushes. So I bought the Airfloss at a local store. I happily used it for a couple of weeks. Then, after having eaten blueberries, I airflossed with care. Then I dug out my Thornton floss. The results were disappointing for Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to regular flossing. I had really wanted the Airfloss to work and enjoyed using it. However, since the results were bad, it&#x27;s a fail in my book.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for about 3 months now and can&#x27;t say enough how important it is for your gum health. I had my last checkup in mid-January 2012 and my hygenist was amazed at my results.  Though I have always cared for my teeth very well, I did not floss at all due to problems with extremely tight contacts.  I was unable to use any floss that could fit between the teeth without actually making a cut through my gums as I yanked it up to the gumline. So, despite repeated warnings from my dentist and hygenist, I remained non-compliant.  We have a cordless waterpik that my husband uses religiously, but I found to be too heavy to hold, and too wet in general.  It also needed constant water refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on Amazon and was conflicted about making the purchase because of so many mixed reviews.  I am glad that I trusted my instinct about Clarisonic products and made the purchase. It took a little bit of time to get used to using the Airfloss, and I found that for me personally the best way to use it was to put the head against the gum and tooth surface and close my mouth over it. This avoids any minimal splashing that you may get. The pressure is perfect to dislodge any food particles that may be present. But best of all, it really does keep tarter buildup at bay. As I initially stated, my hygenist was amazed with my results. I get a cleaning and checkup every 6 months religiously and have ALWAYS had 4s and 5s for my back teeth when she calls out \\&quot;the numbers\\&quot; for gum tissue health.  This time it was ALL 2s and 3s! My best checkup ever in my life, and I am 48 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has turned flossing into an enjoyable event for me, and I use it daily. I add a little bit of mouthwash to the water, but water works just as well.  My teeth feel so smooth, almost \\&quot;fresh from the dentist\\&quot; like.  What once used to be a bloody, torturous task for me has become something I actually look forward to every day. It takes less than a minute to go through your entire mouth.  I like it so much that I do it 3 or 4 times because it is so fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great product for kids as well, it makes flossing fun and is super easy to do.  I highly recommend it to anyone who cares about their teeth and their gum health.  A hearty thumbs-up to Clarisonic on this product!ire mouth.

    <li> Got this for my husband who had just had a bridge put in.  I was going to get a waterpik but decided on this. Why not? A shot of water and air is what the dentist uses on my teeth. My husband really likes the Airfloss.  It is fast and easy to use, not bulky to hold in your hand, and does a really good job at cleaning between the teeth.  He raved about it so much I got one for me and I am not disappointed! I think it is a great product!</li>
    <li> Excellant alternative to regular flossing.  Just hope my dental hygienist agrees on my next visit.  Easy to use.  Long lasting battery.  So far, worth the price.</li>
    <li> The Airflosser does what it is advertised to do and more. It is very good at removing the placque and food that is on and between teeth. It does not remove any of the hard calculus and is not advertised to do so. I use it with mouth wash dispensed from a lab squirt bottle. The resivoir holds very little liquid sometimes not enough to clean the teeth with one filling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my Airfloss.  I use it in combination with \\&quot;regular\\&quot; flossing, kind of like a rinse after the floss scrub.  Also, it seems to reach areas that I may have missed or was unable to reach with floss.  I think it makes my mouth feel more clean and fresh.  It is very simple to use: charge it, add a little water, and go.  I like that it is cordless and easy to store.  Overall, an effective product that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using the product, but it lasted just 2 months (the button activating the spray can no longer be pressed). I am not sure how effective it is, as I haven&#x27;t seen my dentist since I started using it. I called Philips and they are sending me a new one and free return on the defective one. I&#x27;d love to know if other people had the same problem.</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of my hygienist I received my new Phillips AirFlosser from Amazon &amp; about 2 weeks later went for a Dental Prophylaxis.There was a significant reduction in bleeding points Compared to my previous visit and several places where I had 3-4-5 mm pockets had already shrunk by 1 or 2 mm.&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this Phillips product to be one of the more useful periodontal aids in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Alan Arbee&lt;br /&gt;Retired Prosthodontist&lt;br /&gt;Graduate of Western Reserve School of Dental Medicine&lt;br /&gt;&amp; Tufts University Graduate (2 year) Prosthodontics</li>
    <li> I have had braces for 2.5 years now and wish I would have had an airflosser sooner! I have been using a waterpik which was messy and loud! My sister is a dental assistant and she recommended this to me. I love how quiet it is and it gets around all the hooks an brackets in my mouth! I will keep using this even after my braces are off to help keep my mouth healthy.</li>
    <li> It should be noted in BOLD LETTERS that if you have CROWNS OR BRIDGEWORK you should not use the Phillips Airfloss.  I have a bridge.  When I used the airfloss the blast actually felt like a pop.  I stopped using it because the feeling was uncomfortable.When I went to the dentist for my 6 month check-up he noticed that the tooth holding up the bridge (an anchor tooth) was broken away from the bridge.  I ended up having to have the broken tooth removed and the bridge changed.  The bridge was only 6 years old.  It ended up costing me almost $4,000.00. A very expensive deal.</li>
    <li> I love the Phillips Sonicare.  It is so much easier and less messy to use than products with a water reservoir and little hoses.  It really only takes about a minute to do all my teeth and uses only about a tablespoon of water.  My periodontist recommended it and I&#x27;m glad he did.</li>
    <li> runs out of floss juice way to quickly.  convenient, but still quite messy. good first run. i enjoy being a Guinea pig and trying to make it work for Philips.  One floss head with the device is all you get, so everybody needs their own. it feel good in my teeth and to use it, i give them credit. it cleans the gum line, so mission accomplished.</li>
    <li> THIS PIECE OF JUNK, STOPS WORKING DAYS BEFORE THE 30 DAY WARRANTY.. DO NOT BUY.. THIS PIECE OF JUNK IS NOT GUARANTEED AT 30 DAYS. IT BEEN 32 DAYS.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for just over two months and the flosser produced excellent results.  Both my dentist and periodontist saw improvements in my dental health.  Then,  it stopped working.  The battery&#x27;s o.k. but it won&#x27;t \\&quot;fire\\&quot; anymore.  The Phillips warranty people were accommodating and said they&#x27;d send out a new one,  but then I got an email saying the product replacement was \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot;.  Many of the reviews I read before I bought on AMAZON cautioned about similar occurances....so I should have paid attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  That was the original review.  I have since been provided two replacements from Phillips.  One which failed again.  I have found that using mouthwash in the unit (which is sanctioned if not encouraged by Phillips) has been killing the machines.  So now my 1.5 year old Airfloss is still working perfectly and I have been getting great reviews at the dentist and periodontist.  (I told Phillips about this but they are apparently still recommending using mouthwash)  However,  used with an electric tooth brush such as the Braun Professional Care and Listerine mouthwash,  I think Airfloss  is about the best home treatment available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m well pleased with Sonicare.  It gives a very thorough, refreshing  flossing. It is very easy to use and to clean.</li>
    <li> If you are lazy and don&#x27;t want to take the time to floss your teeth then this is the best product to use. The only draw back is the liquid container is too small. This product does not replace water pick they have different functions.</li>
    <li> Difficult and messy to use.  You have to press the activate button for each burst of air/water between each tooth. It only holds about a tablespoon of water.  My cordless water pic does a much quicker and more thorough job.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use with little mess like a regular water flosser.I think they could have done better on the charging unit.It is small and not real stable.It does not take much to tip it over. All in all it is a fun thing to use and seems to do a good job. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s jet was less powerful than I expected, but it seems worked quite based on my feeling. My fingers possibly were too big and my mouth might be a little bit small so I have difficulty in using a normal floss.  Though it was not that powerful, I still had some slight bleeding while using it, though I didn&#x27;t feel any pain from it.  However, after less than 3 weeks&#x27; usage, it suddenly refuse to charge. The thing just flashed to indicate it was out of battery even after I have put it on the charger for a long time. I have tried charging it 12hrs, 24 hrs and 36hrs but it never wake up again. Sometimes it was totally dead and sometimes worked for a single split (yes, pushing the button once only).  I return it and have full refund, but I am afraid this Philips product has bad QC. I use a lot of rechargeable equipment, including a Philips sonicare, and this is the first time I have something failing in weeks.</li>
    <li> Worked surprisingly well.&lt;br /&gt;I fill mine with mouth wash.</li>
    <li> I always dread the dentist and her tut-tutting about my teeth but honestly, who has time to floss?  So when I read about this gadget I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot (sorry for the pun!).  And I am so glad I did - I read other reviews that said it was a bit hard to use but I had no issues and my teeth have felt cleaner all day.  Give it a go, hopefully your dentist will notice the difference. And I&#x27;m still contemplating the review that suggested filling it with Vodka - that might be worth a whirl :))</li>
    <li> Like most people, I don&#x27;t floss nearly as often as I should. So when I saw this new product from Philips, I had to give this a shot. You may already be familiar with how it works. You fill the device with a little bit of water and it uses that and air to shoot a compressed stream between your teeth to knock out lodged food or other obstructions. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a bit awkward to use or not powerful enough, though it could be because I don&#x27;t have very large gaps between my teeth, so the device didn&#x27;t really seem to blast anything out or through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- decent battery life&lt;br /&gt;- reservoir holds enough water to clean entire mouth&lt;br /&gt;- perhaps more convenient than flossing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- if you have relatively straight teeth with narrow or nonexistent gaps, it&#x27;ll be difficult/awkward to clean&lt;br /&gt;- kinda messy as it blows the debris out between your teeth</li>
    <li> If you play tennis, you may have several types of racquets. If you golf, you definitely have many types of clubs. When you exercise, you perform many types of exercises, routines, and use all sorts of equipment. Oral hygiene is similar, and therefore is best viewed from a fitness perspective. The Sonicare Airfloss is a new piece of Oral Fitness equipment. if you really think about it a moment, you will realize that regular flossing is almost like moving plaque from one tooth to another and jamming it into the gums. Yet it is standard advice to floss in this manner. Now here we have a unique piece of equipment that blasts junk out from between teeth and is easier and faster than flossing. Plus, you can add all sorts of medicaments into the reservoir for added effects. You can&#x27;t very well do that with floss. A couple days ago, I purposely got a bunch of chicken jammed between my teeth. I tried flossing it out and all that happened was I crammed the chicken deeper between my teeth. I used the Airfloss, and after six blasts, the chicken flew out and hit my tongue. Most people don&#x27;t floss. Many people can&#x27;t floss. Only about 20% of us floss at all, and most of the time it&#x27;s done incorrectly. We need innovations like this to help people obtain better oral health. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s valid comparing the Airfloss with other Oral Fitness products any more than comparing various exercise devices. They all have different uses, benefits, targets, etc. I think it&#x27;s odd that people may have many types of sporting equipment, or tools, but when it comes to oral health, they may have only a toothbrush and very rarely floss. I think we should expand our oral health products to include all sorts of products for specific uses, just like we do with tools and sporting equipment. Therefore, I highly recommend the Sonicare Airfloss for that reason.</li>
    <li> I do not think it is a replacement for flossing with dental floss. However if you do not floss at all it is certainly better than no flossing. I am using this 2x/day as I am developing spaces between my teeth that trap food particles. It does a good job at blasting out the debris, it is not perfect.  I am still flossing once a day to scape the tooth spaces clean. I have some arthritis and I find it easy to use and refill. I fill it up for each use as sometimes it requires a few blasts to get everything out. It is still better at that than flossing, I use less floss and save time keeping my mouth clean.</li>
    <li> It was not a very good experience since i had to return the product within a day of first use. Not very happy with experience but got new one and it seems to work ok so far. i will have to see how it goes.</li>
    <li> Like I stated in the title, if your goal is to give up on string flossing, you can do this by using this device. The only trick is to really spend some time and adjust your habits, maybe watch what you&#x27;re doing in the mirror and figure it out. It&#x27;s not complicated nor rocket-science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the pros and cons regarding this Airflosser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s designed wonderfully and fit&#x27;s into my hand nicely. I always brush my teeth in the shower so it&#x27;s big enough that it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You can fully submerse this thing without fear of it going south on you. This thing has been dropped in water a lot and has stayed mounted in my shower where it&#x27;s usual bombarded by water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Ease of use. Open cap, put in water. Hit button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The results from this flosser are incredible. You can tell right away how poorly typical flossing is as you can get a lot more junk out of your mouth with something like this on a more consistent basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. I&#x27;m still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. As other have mentioned you have to be careful, if you don&#x27;t figure out your own way to use this thing properly for the shape of your own mouth, you could crack a tooth from the recoil of the plastic head during the initial blast of water. It&#x27;s pretty intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Perhaps this needs to do just more than one short blast. How about a longer blast of water so you can close in on an area to avoid said recoil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. That head needs to be a very soft rubber instead. Hard to understand why it isn&#x27;t already</li>
    <li> I gave this one the old college try, but have to say I&#x27;m not that impressed. Sometimes less is more, and I think that is true in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While easy enough to use, the Sonicare Airfloss just doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as doing it the old fashioned way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is better than floss. But there are so many products now which make flossing easier and give you the ability to reach into the harder to reach spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is too big to be that manuervarable, and the woooooosh is not strong enough to really get the food out from between the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars, instead of one, for the people who just will not put their own hands near their mouths, no matter what. (Yes, I know people like that.) This is better than nothing for them.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have a permenant lower retainer, that is really hard to floss. The Airfloss, makes it so easy to floss this annoying area! I use this after every meal, feels like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist, to have my teeth cleaned! Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> I am in my early 50&#x27;s....and still have my wisdom teeth. I guess I never got around to getting them removed....and now it just looms as a hugely unpopular endeavor to have to endure. I have some deep 6 and 7 cm pockets surrounding these teeth and to say the least...it&#x27;s been a problem flossing in the \\&quot;conventional\\&quot; way. I found the Sonicare HX8111 in a google search for a solution....and wow..I noticed how great this airfloss was working based on the amount of blood coming from my mouth. (sorry for the bad visual...but it&#x27;s a true test to its effectiveness)....A great find!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased the air floss three months ago.  Just had my first dental check-up since the purchase.  Was in and out in 35 mins. vs. my usual hour.  Had the best check-up.  My gum health and lack of placque was the best in years.  I&#x27;m more willinng to use this devices than the tape.  Now I floss after every meal.  My teeth are not closely spaced.  I hold my lower lip up to control spray &amp; drool.  No problem using this method.  I make two rounds upper, lowers, inside, and outer.  It&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable in my hand.  I use perioxide instead of water or mouthwash. The tablespoon amount isn&#x27;t large enough.  A redesign to provide a larger reservior for more than a tablespon would be desirable.  I appreciate the lighted on button.  Many times I forget to hit the off button.  As I sit the flosser down my eye has caught the glowing light, that I appreciate.  If you hate to floss with tape, I suggest giving this handy device a try.</li>
    <li> I take really good care of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A puff of air came out but nothing with it or no result such as flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try it again to see if maybe I do not understand the concept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will continue to floss and do everything the way I have been doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase again, it looks nice, etc but I believe it is just \\&quot;fluff\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have a Waterpick and also bought the Airfloss. After using it for two months, I discovered that I had to follow using the airflow with traditional floss because it didn&#x27;t remove plaque particularly between my lower fron teeth. While it is pleasant to use and does remove some food particles stuck between the teeth, plaque is what really needs to be removed for proper dental health. I am sorry I wasted my money on this gadget.</li>
    <li> This machine does NOTHING..squirts out a few drops..does nothing!!!!, I returned and purchased water pick and it works great..it should not be on the market.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in August 2011, and was satisfied with it until about a month ago, May 2012, when it stopped working.  The battery no longer appears to hold a charge, and there appears to be no way to replace it.  For an item that cost about $100 originally, non-replaceable batteries that die after less than nine months are not acceptable! It&#x27;s back to plain old floss for me.</li>
    <li> I am sure this product may be fine.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, still recovering from wounds inflicted while trying to open the package. Tried pliers, butcher knife, scissors, just about everything I could think of.  WHAT is it?  Do they think someone will break into the stupid package and steal it enroute??  It&#x27;s just a TOOTH FLOSSER for crying out loud!!!  This is a ridiculous waste of time and resources.  My wife and I worked and worked just to try to open the package, the hard plastic is impenetrable and there is no easy way to get in.  If you are like Paul Bunyan and have unlimited strength and patience, go for it.  I CHAllENGE THE CEO of  Philips to show a U-Tube clip of him/her  receiving the package and opening it without a blow torch and jack hammer.  Do these people EVER use their own products?  Apparently not or they would make the packaging easier to open.  Disgusted.  I hate to even look at the stupid thing now.</li>
    <li> I received the Philips Airfloss as a gift. Knowing how pleased I was with my Sonicare Elite toothbrush, I expected to have the same positive experience with this unit. Not only did it not seem to hold a charge, it could not hold the water in it&#x27;s chamber without leaking. Using the product was an experience on keeping your mouth closed around the flossing head to keep from spraying all over the mirror. I&#x27;ve had the unit for just about 2 months, used it maybe 12 times due to the charging issues. Recently the unit no longer takes a charge at all. Completely dead. I think I&#x27;ll get a Waterpik to replace it.</li>
    <li> The flosser seems to work fairly well, but I gave it only 3 stars because of the deceptive way it&#x27;s advertised here. The $10 rebate is NOT A CASH REBATE, so it actually does not make the purchase price $10 lower \\&quot;after rebate\\&quot; as the page implies. Rather than cash, the rebate is a choice of 3 discounts on future purchases of Sonicare products (including another purchse of the very same product, hello?). So you will NOT see $10 more in your pocket after buying this. On the contrary, to take advantage of the rebate you need to buy MORE Sonicare products, and not cheap ones. I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I spend a whopping $75 for a personal-care gadget, I don&#x27;t spin around and wonder how I might buy more gadgets in the same price range from the same people. In my view this was a dishonest incentive, and the details should not have been concealed behind a link that purchasers are unlikely to click.</li>
    <li> Thought that using this product could take the place of flossing, which I really hate to do. It&#x27;s so much more pleasant and refreshing than floss. However, I saw my dentist after a few weeks of using it. He remarked that I must not be flossing, as there was a lot of plaque between my teeth and in the gum line.     Not sure it&#x27;s worth spending nearly a hundred bucks for the Airfloss.  But if you buy this product, be sure to use it in addition to (not instead of) flossing.</li>
    <li> After about a month of use, I find that this does what it claims to do, it actually works.    Does it work as well as pulling a rope through teeth the traditional way?  Almost, but not quite.  There will be rare  occasions when even this ingenious arrangement of  compressed air and water fails, so don&#x27;t throw away your floss, but look at it this way:  99% creates great convenience and time saving, 99% is a good deal.  In the case of my unit, the claim of 2 weeks on a battery charge was understated, my unit did much better than that.  That&#x27;s the good news.  The less good news is the little plastic flap that covers the water filling entrance falls off at a touch, and its tiny hinges are so flimsy I know they&#x27;ll break before any other part, and what then?  Open and close with extreme care and a light touch.    If you already have a sonicare toothbrush of recent vintage, its 110+220 smart  charger will serve the airfloss as well, which is a great convenience if, as I do, you travel, and travel internationally and are then not stuck with having to pack and keep track of two chargers.   I ordered the extra nozzles as well, no sign of them a month later along with Amazon&#x27;s computer generated \\&quot;we&#x27;re sorry\\&quot; note, and that&#x27;s just not acceptable.</li>
    <li> I own a Philips Sonicare toothbrush and loved it so much that this purchase was a no brainer for me. UNFORTUNATELY the airfloss absolutely sucks. This product does not even come close to removing plaque from between the teeth nor does it leave you with a fresh clean feeling between your teeth. The first 3 taps to send a \\&quot;burst\\&quot; through your teeth do not even work and the small compartment for water or mouthwash runs out before you use it on all your spaces. I am literally packing it up as I speak and going to return it at Bed, Bath, and Beyond. I sincerely hope this review saved somebody the time and disappointment that I have experienced with this inferior, overly hyped, piece of plastic.     Side note 1: Flossing is a pain in the arse, but it is much better than someone drilling your face when you have cavities!    Side note 2: Philips Sonicare \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; TOOTHBRUSH is awesome and totally worth the purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this unit to share with someone; however, the nozzle head was EXTREMELY hard to remove. I had to use a flathead to remove the nozzle and that prove to be very difficult. You have to be careful or else the plastic rim of the unit will also get damaged.  What made it worse was when I first got the product and try to remove the nozzle, the nozzle broke off. Had to buy the stupid replacement heads, since it only comes with one nozzle.   The product was also poorly designed. Docking the unit on the charger was unstable as it wobbles a little. I couldn&#x27;t tell if the unit was charging or the unit was docked properly. The light was flashing, but didn&#x27;t know for sure if its charging on and off.</li>
    <li> I have always found traditional flossing difficult as my teeth are a tight fit. This flosser has been an effective replacement, improving my gum health. I purchased it at the recommendation of my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fill it with mouthwash to get that really clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure and rinse completely when using mouthwash, as mouthwash can evaporate in the mechanism and lock it up.</li>
    <li> I bought this item on August 12 and in Novemeber it completely stopped working... it won&#x27;t hold a charge and of course is past the date I&#x27;m able to return it.  I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with the way it worked to begin with.  I really doubt it&#x27;s a replacement for flossing... it&#x27;s basically a way to shoot some mouthwash between your teeth and that&#x27;s about it.  I paid $89 for mine and see the price has dropped to $79... still not worth it!  Save your money!!</li>
    <li> It takes about 3 days to get used to how this air flosser works.  On the first try I thought it might not be working until the blast of air hit my tongue.  Then, I was like, \\&quot;wow, that&#x27;s a powerful force of air\\&quot;.  It works.  No pain, just pops of air and water that are powerful enough to bounce off your teeth and send water back a foot or so onto the mirror.  Once you get used to it (about 3 days) \\&quot;you can tell\\&quot; when you have used it and you can tell when you&#x27;ve not used it for even a day.  It dislodges even popcorn kernel casings, which is saying something.  Occasionally, I still use a piece of regular floss to between two teeth that are extremely close together, but this is because there is no room for the air and water to blow through.</li>
    <li> Does this clean between teeth and the gum line as good as a good manual flossing, no way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as I hate flossing and find it tedious, uncomfortable and somewhat even painful I never floss, except if something is stuck between my teeth actually bugging me or for a couple of days before going to my six month check up and cleanings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am certainly not bragging about that, just admitting the truth and I bet there are a ton of people that do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is you or close, I strongly recommend the Airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found I am willing to Airfloss daily, in fact, I am willing to do it both in the morning and at bedtime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a visibly good job of getting food particles and gunk from between the teeth and it&#x27;s quick, easy and fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep, your going to get yourself in the face and spray on the mirror a time or two in the beginning, but anyone that takes a week to get use to this is just a slow learner. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Airfloss as I am finally flossing daily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the mechanics, the Airfloss is comfortable in my hand, easy to fill, use and empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it&#x27;s tiny reservoir is good for two uses, but I don&#x27;t like the idea of leaving water sit in it so I just dump (more like shake) the little bit of water in the reservoir out after each use and fill it again just prior to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says you can use mouthwash in it, but although I have been using it for about a month I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that might be a bit too intense \\&quot;a taste\\&quot; for my liking. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the biggest downside to me is this is a single person use tool as while the tip is replaceable it doesn&#x27;t appear like it&#x27;s designed to swap tips daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was made to easily switch tips like our Oral-B electric toothbrush where the entire family uses it with their own color coded toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, I also like the induction charging system so you don&#x27;t have any shock danger messing around sinks and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a little two sided tape to the bottom of the charger and it makes a great stand for the unit on the vanity top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-02-2011: Ok, I&#x27;ve had the flosser for over three months now and still really like it. I finally got around to trying it with mouthwash. This works great and really supercharges the taste of flossing. LOL An added plus is I think this is a great way to help keep the unit \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; as the mouthwash kills 99% of the bacteria, etc. and running it through the unit by using it and leaving the reservoir full of mouthwash (I empty it after use when using water) should really keep it close to sterilized. For me using this is far quicker than manually flossing, less tedious and I actually use it when I normally just \\&quot;put off\\&quot; manually flossing and truthfully was something I seldom bothered to do. I look forward to pleasantly surprising the dental technician next check up. I expect she will say I see you finally have started flossing. &amp;lt;grin&gt;nd it makes a great stand for the unit on the vanity top.

    <li> I LOVE the sonic care water floss. I use it twice a day. It&#x27;s quick and effective. This machine will get out food pieces that flossing sometimes misses.</li>
    <li> I use the Sonicare FlexCare Plus for brushing and thought there might be some synergy with the  Airfloss.  So I tried the Airfloss twice a day for three weeks. It was a waste of time; it hardly cleans between the teeth and does not get under the gum-line...repeat, it does NOT get under the gum-line. If you&#x27;re not cleaning under the gum-line, then you&#x27;re skipping an essential step in oral hygiene. I can only imagine the bacteria build-up for those who rely solely on an Airfloss for what it might possibly clean between teeth.  After the third day I went back to using my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser as well as the Airfloss. The Waterpik consistently found what the Airfloss left behind.  My dental hygienist has been using oral irrigation for cleaning for several years and finally convinced me to get the Waterpik last year. I think most modern dental offices use oral irrigation. The Airfloss feels nothing like the oral irrigation that a hygienist uses.  I had thought the Airfloss might be good for travel but I&#x27;ll buy a Waterpik Cordless for travel and stick with my Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for home use; since I&#x27;ve had the Waterpik, my semi-annual exams went from very good to excellent.  Note: When I switched to the Waterpik, I followed up with string floss just to make sure the Waterpik was working as advertised. I stopped using string floss after a week or so. I do bring string floss with me when I travel. And I&#x27;m one of those people you might see flossing in a restaurant restroom.  If your choices are never flossing (string or irrigation) and the Airfloss, then go with the Airfloss.  Fortunately I was able to return the Airfloss for a complete refund.</li>
    <li> I have always had a difficult time flossing my teeth, especially toward the rear of my mouth.  My teeth are too tight, and my jaw shape isn&#x27;t very floss-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for several years, and it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried.  But it doesn&#x27;t floss, and I&#x27;ve always dreaded my dental visits because my lack of flossing leads to easily bleeding and related dental issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the Airfloss advertised, I was a little skeptical.  I had a WaterPik at one point, and it was just too much trouble and messy for me to get excited about.  But this sounded different, and it wasn&#x27;t incredibly expensive.  I had to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my delight, this rechargeable flosser is incredible.  It uses a tiny blast of air with just enough water/mouthwash to blast out any debris.  Just press it to the slot between teeth and flick the convenient trigger. The blast is perhaps a tenth of a second.  It works superbly, and you can do your entire mouth in less time than it takes to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that it comes with only one flosser tip. My wife doesn&#x27;t want to share, so I&#x27;ve ordered additional tips.  My gums bled for the first few days (Philips warns of this), but even that stopped after four or five days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I would rather have been waterboarded than attempt to floss my entire mouth.  Not so after this!  I actually look forward to using it each day.  I definitely give it 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> Yeah - you read it right.  Yesterday, my dog would not stop barking and I was losing what little is left of my mind and was going to get the water spray bottle out, but had the brilliant idea to try the Airfloss. One squirt was all it took. The water and noise instantly shut him up - which also shut me up because now I wasn&#x27;t yelling at him to \\&quot;shut up!\\&quot; I love the little guy dearly, but sometimes . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as flossing with this product?&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it - - it&#x27;s fun - -but still do a follow-up flossing in the tight spaces.  And after using this first, flossing is so much easier.  My husband hates to floss (who actually loves flossing?), but is now using this daily.  So that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> This device has made teeth care more professional outside the dental surgery. Cleaning the gap between teeth replaces flossing in a much more efficient manner; quick and easy with no need to force bits of string between your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Since using this Flosser, my teeth look much better and my mouth feels much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Easy and quick to use, it makes teeth care more pleasurable. The best dental care purchase since the battery operated toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The two go together beautifully. My teeth have never been happier!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Coolness&lt;br /&gt;2. Convenience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. Unreliable: unit died in a month and its replacement died in 10 months (lost three stars because of this)&lt;br /&gt;2. not powerful enough&lt;br /&gt;3. ineffective between teeth that don&#x27;t have some spacing&lt;br /&gt;4. Water/Mouthwash store is too small, does not complete two full uses.</li>
    <li> If you have good teeth, you probably have bad gums and vice-versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a young man, I didn&#x27;t take very good care of my gums, and after several dentists warned me that I could lose teeth unless I shaped up, I started a rigorous nightly dental routine which I continue today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I begin with the Sonicare Flex Care Power Brush -- the long routine, with pulsating gum massage -- followed by the Water Pik Power Flosser, followed by easy-glide dental floss, followed by interdental brushing and guiding a rubber tip around the gum lines inside and out, concluding with the water pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I got one of these Air Flossers -- using it after the dental floss in my routine.  It seems to help my gums.  At my most recent checkup, my gums didn&#x27;t bleed, and there was only one minor area of inflammation at the very back.  That&#x27;s better than the checkups I had before I started using the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will this gizmo take the place of dental floss or the water pik?  No -- I think it is best used as another tool in the arsenal, another jolt to stimulate your gums and tell them you mean business!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And indeed, the water pik always seems to dislodge a few particles of food that all the other implements missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless based on my latest checkup, I think the Air Flosser does help keep your gums firm and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to use and cheap to maintain.  Sonicare says to replace the tip every six months, but I have been using filtered water to prevent mineral buildup; we&#x27;ll see if that prolongs the life of the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, the unit holds a battery charge for a long time -- several weeks, with twice-daily use -- and I get two uses out of one reservoir of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have good teeth and bad gums -- you may want to try adding the Air Flosser to your oral hygiene regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Fast and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;* Attractive Design.&lt;br /&gt;* Seems to promote healthy gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Probably not a replacement for water pik or floss, but a supplement.gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Probably not a replacement for water pik or floss, but a supplement.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that my teeth hate me. I have had major dental work in all but one tooth. It is not from lack of brushing or flossing either. I brush my teeth on average 5 times a day. I just have weak enamel and a very acidic mouth, combined with a family history of pyria? I have been using a Waterpik most of my life (over a decade not sharing my age thanks), when the soniccare type brushes came out i started using them. Between regular floss when it is a quick brush, the sonic toothbrush, and a waterpik, my teeth don&#x27;t get as many cavities or root canals. Nothing has worked for my pockets.&lt;br /&gt;Well a couple weeks after the airflosser came out i thought sure I will try it. I had just gone for a cleaning so I knew where my pockets measured. Six months later I have one pocket that went from a 7 to a 3. In fact all my pockets have reduced. I am definitely a happy user.&lt;br /&gt;The one draw back is when you first start using the airflosser, open your mouth to see placement  but close before you actovate, otherwise you will need to clean your mirror. After a couple uses you get used to where it goes and don&#x27;t need to look anymore. Also i use mouthwash and not wate.</li>
    <li> Worthless. Mine would not put out any spray after 1 week.  The handle doesn&#x27;t hold enough liquid, very hard to fill.  Mess everywhere.  I did finally get a replacement handle, the new one had to be pressed every time for a spray, hard to do as the old one just shot out liquid at intervals with one press.  Wore myself out trying to use the replacement handle.  I am sending it back to the company, very unsatisfied with this product.  Did anyone not working for the company try this disaster out?  And they say that Obamacare is flawed.</li>
    <li> I loved Airfloss until stopped working THREE TIMES!! At first, it just stopped after 2 months. I called Amazon, they sent to me new one quickly. However Airfloss stopped AGAIN after 3 months used. Called Philips, they gave me a new one but it STOPPED AGAIN after 8 months used.  What wrong with Airfloss???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own DiamondClean and I love it. I’ve been using Philips Sonicare toothbrush for almost 15 years because Sonicare products are better than others but NOT Airfloss.</li>
    <li> This is a great flosser. My Mom has Alzheimer&#x27;s and it is hard to brush and floss her teeth without drowning her. But, this product uses a small amount of water and air to clean between her teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Kohl&#x27;s because it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was still pretty expensive even with the discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is useless.  I still floss once a day and brush twice a day and figured this would just be extra cleaning on top of all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a joke though.  It just sprays water between your teeth.  I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking, I really just bought this one impulse since I had Kohl&#x27;s cash and wanted to use it up since it was going to expire that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were really pushing this product in the store too, it was on all the shelves placed all over the store so you couldn&#x27;t miss it.  Even by the underwear and neckties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the hell?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the biggest jerk when I&#x27;m using it, maybe it does something but probably not.  I had a checkup a month after using this and my dentist told me I need to floss more, and I was flossing every day.  She said I need to use a better technique.  This thing obviously wasn&#x27;t doing much if that&#x27;s the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like someone is spitting on your teeth, that&#x27;s how weak the burst is, it&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This device appears to have accelerated the cracking of a tooth that already had a crack in it. The force of the jet action is very strong. In the hands of a less than professional user without knowledge of such tooth problems, use might prove troublesome</li>
    <li> this takes some time to get used to, because it flosses very differently from other flosses.  It sends out very quick jets streams of water.  I guess it is doing as good a job as the others, but it is a little more difficult to use, time will tell and so will the dentist when my teeth are checked next time.  We have to use our flosses in the shower because they spray water everywhere and it makes a mess.</li>
    <li> Airfloss stopped working after 5 weeks. Am waiting for a replacement. This is an expensive product to stop working after such little use. Time-consuming to call customer service to replace. Make sure you get a warranty with it.</li>
    <li> This product, although a great idea doesn&#x27;t work.  It wouldn&#x27;t charge consistently which makes it unusable, the balance of the airfloss causes it to fall off the charger.  Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest. The airfloss and how much you like it will not only depend on your teeth but the type of person you are. To decide if this is the right buy for you you need to look at a few things about yourself first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Do you currenlty floss with string once or more a day without fail? If so then this product won&#x27;t hold that many benifits for you. The only one would be because of its fast and easy operation and ability to hold a charge for a very long time (a few weeks), you can take it to work with you and avoid those awkward moments in the public rest room leaning close to the mirror with string hanging out of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you don&#x27;t have the time to floss or just plain don&#x27;t like to, then this is a great product for you. While it may not work perfect between every tooth (sometimes if there is no space at all between teeth it can&#x27;t work properly) it&#x27;s better than nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It does take a little time to get used to it&#x27;s operation and you back splash on the mirror and counter top a little but after you get used to it that won&#x27;t happen very often. You may experience some gum bleeding at first especialy if your gum health isn&#x27;t up to par. Don&#x27;t worry this is normal and will stop eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All in all I found this to be a good product. It does the job it&#x27;s supposed to. It not perfect but like I said, it depends on you and your teeth.</li>
    <li> -Unit worked great for first month then it started squirting mouthwash from the bottom of the stem, I tried the replacement stem and had the same issue. Then 3 days later the motor died, pressing the button results in a small rumbling sound without any air being pushed out. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas 2011.  I&#x27;m not a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviews cite the \\&quot;mess\\&quot; this makes.  Honestly, all you have to do is hold it back from your gums just slightly and close your lips around the flosser.  When you do this, it&#x27;s surprising how hard the water blasts in.  You&#x27;ll feel it when you&#x27;ve done this right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve found this thing to blast out every piece of meat stuck in my teeth, and my teeth are crowded.  I initially doubted it&#x27;s ability to do this, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve flossed a few times when I&#x27;ve been out of town without this and my gums do NOT bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it sounds like a spring is snapping when you push the button, but Soniccare&#x27;s customer service has yet to let me down.</li>
    <li> 8111 and 8181 are the same exact unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is 8181 is what dentists sell to you, while 8111 is what you would find in a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the units sold on Amazon originated from a dentist....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Based on chat with Sonicare rep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can I rate an item that I have not used / purchased?&lt;br /&gt;What a crappy review page setup.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars because I&#x27;ve been happy with Philips products.</li>
    <li> Because it makes my gums bleed like a stuck pig.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I really prefer something that just sprays water rather than violent microblasts of vapour.</li>
    <li> The Airfloss could turn you into a drool monster, or Dracula. Or, it could just do a great job of cleaning between your teeth. I&#x27;m banking on the latter. (After nearly 2 years of use and some of the best checkups I&#x27;ve ever had, I am a true believer in this device, Jan. 10, 2013 update)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product. The gadget aspect of it is nice. The handle is about the diameter of two Sonicare toothbrushes, it&#x27;s pretty big, but feels really good in my hand. My teeth felt like I had been to the dentist for a cleaning. The airfloss does power through built up food nicely. I didn&#x27;t floss for a few days, and all the spices, little bits of food, and Wonder White bread stuck between my teeth came right out. I can reach to the back of my mouth really easily, those molars tend to never get a flossing, they will now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 10, 2013: Sadness, the handle stopped working. I called Philips and they are sending me a brand new handle. Turns out this has a 2 year warranty for any defects. This is way beyond my expectations. The customer support person talked me through troubleshooting to be sure the handle was malfunctioning. Once he determined the unit was broken, I was on hold for a few minutes, and a brand new handle is on its way. Included in the replacement is a return shipping label. This is by far the best warranty service I have ever witnessed. He simply needed a serial number and there were absolutely no questions asked to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two dentist visits between my last update. The first was excellent, no gum bleeding, very healthy and my dentist was impressed. The most recent visit wasn&#x27;t as good, I slacked off using the Airfloss and it showed. It is important for me to use this twice a day, and I was skipping days. Yes I got a stern talking to by my dentist and hygenist (I deserved it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People can debate that this is not a replacement for flossing. That&#x27;s fine. But in my hands, this thing is so much better than flossing - I hate flossing. Yes I hate flossing more than anybody can imagine and I won&#x27;t do it regularly. I use this thing twice a day and am happy using ing. Theory and practice are two very different things. Nearly two years of use proves that to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 1, 2011 Dentist Visit Update: This is one of the best dental appointments I have ever had. My experience with the Airfloss is outstanding. I started using this device the day of my last check up six months ago. I have used it religiously for the past 6 months, and today is the day I got the results of using this. There is absolutely no question about it, my mouth and teeth are much healthier than they have ever been. Normally my gums show some bleeding during the cleaning, and they are usually somewhat red. Today, they were healthy and pink, with very little bleeding. The hygienist normally spends a long time scraping my teeth, today she spent maybe half the time. Both my dentist and hygienist said the device works and are happy with how much better my gums and teeth look - they will begin recommending it to their patients. This is my personal experience with the Airfloss. I have a lot of trouble flossing or even remembering to floss (actually I pretty much hate flossing), I have no problem brushing my teeth twice a day. Adding this 15 second step to my routine, and I can get a great check up - I&#x27;m totally sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 26, 2011 Update: My teeth have never felt cleaner now that I use this at least daily, sometimes twice per day. As I said below, I travel with this I love it that much. A note for those of you that have closely spaced teeth. My wife has trouble finding floss that will fit between her teeth - this device does not work for her. I&#x27;ve never had trouble getting floss between my teeth, so I must be an ideal candidate. If you have very closely spaced teeth (you probably know if you do), you might want to pass on the Airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 12, 2012 Update: Some of the other reviews of this product and comments have complained that this is not ADA approved, and that water piks are their favorite thing to use because they are reliable. The ADA has never approved a water pik - they are not ADA approved. In fact no electric dental gadget has been approved by them. So the ADA mark is nice, but missing that approval does not mean a device is a bad device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The orginal review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the reservoir cover; it doesn&#x27;t close with a snap that would reassure me it is closed. Not every single speck of food was removed in one pass. I can see that using this every day, between my teeth will be cleaner. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get the little head lined up exactly right, either getting a shot of water in my mouth, on the mirror, or misfiring (the little tip was plugged by my teeth and nothing came out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums did bleed a little the first use, but they also do that when I don&#x27;t floss for a few days. The bleeding stopped after the third day. I wasn&#x27;t dripping blood from my mouth like Dracula; it was that redness right around the gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no ADA (American Dental Association) certificate on this device. That certificate would be nice. This is a very new product. It just happened that the day after I received this, I had a dentist appointment. My dentist is pretty aware of the latest teeth cleaning devices (he actually had a Sonicare toothbrush a good long while before they were available in the store), he had never heard of this. This isn&#x27;t a dentist&#x27;s approval of the Airfloss, but he did say it looked like a really good idea. And anything that would encourage people to floss more is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 4, 2012 Update: A little clarification on the ADA - I visited their site and looked over what products have ADA seal of approval. Would it surprise you to know that not a single electric toothbrush, or water pic has their seal of approval? In fact nothing with an electric cord has their seal of approval. I have no experience with this organization, how they approve products, or their rules for what to accept for testing, but it appears to me this device, along with all the other electric dental products, will not get their seal of approval. Not because they are bad products, but because the ADA just doesn&#x27;t do that, plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of different people could use the Airfloss: People with big hands that find flossing the rear teeth difficult. People with a disability where a caregiver needs to floss for them, or have difficulty holding floss with two hands for themselves. Or people that want to be encouraged to floss more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for around three years. That toothbrush takes a lot of getting used to, getting over the crazy tickling on my teeth, avoid spraying toothpaste all over the room, and getting over the annoying noise.&lt;br /&gt;Like the Sonicare toothbrush, the Airfloss takes some practice. My first few times around I managed to drool all over my shirt and completely wash down the bathroom mirror. Of course some of you will be more mechanically inclined and figure out how to avoid the drool bath and mirror cleaning. The secret is to hold your lower lip up, and make sure the little head is seated between your teeth and not on an angle. It&#x27;s also important to hold the unit with the tip up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is incredibly simple. It is basically a liquid reservoir and a pump that fires a shot of water and air out the little tip. Pressing on the big green button at the top of the white handle, starts off a winding up noise, a deep click, and a puff. At the base there is a rubber sealed on / off switch. The charger looks like a small hockey puck. Like the Sonicare toothbrush, charging is by induction, meaning there are no electrical contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid reservoir holds about a tablespoon and is supposed to be good for two uses. I actually have to refill mine for a lap around mymouth, maybe I have way more teeth than the average bear. The instructions allow for water or mouthwash in the reservoir. I like the idea of mouthwash; it feels really great in my mouth. Mouthwash can form a hard residue, and that could plug up the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say if sharing this device is a good or bad idea. The tip is solid plastic and shiny, there are no bristles at all on it. A little rinse off with mouthwash should clean the tip off for somebody else to use. Well you know, for your significant other, not a community thing for strangers. The tip is really hard to remove, I wouldn&#x27;t want to constantly snap it off and snap on another tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips recommends changing the tip every six months. Hard for me to see exactly what could go wrong with the tip. But they are really inexpensive (around nine dollars for a pair [[ASIN:B0052JNCFE Philips Sonicare HX8002/60 Airfloss Replacement NOuncezles, 2 Count]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One charge is supposed to last about two weeks. The unit is fully charged overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction manual is very nice. They even include instructions on how to dispose of the unit when it has expired and you no longer need it. About four times they repeat that this procedure will destroy the unit. The pictures are to wrap the unit in a cloth, smash it with a hammer, and remove the battery. The smashed bits can be tossed in the trash, and the battery should be recycled. This is a new one for me; I&#x27;ve never seen a company that recommends smashing their device with a hammer to remove the battery. Pretty cool Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a million times better than a water pik. The Airfloss is a puff between the teeth, a water pik is like a squirt gun all over the place. And there&#x27;s that nasty hose with the water pik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so guilty of not flossing, and know I should floss more often. During one six month period, I flossed every night and used mouthwash, that dentist appointment was quick and easy - almost no scraping necessary. The rest of the time, my dentist reminds me to floss more. This gadget just might get me to floss every night now.approval.

During one six month period, I flossed every night and used mouthwash, that dentist appointment was quick and easy - almost no scraping necessary. The rest of the time, my dentist reminds me to floss more. This gadget just might get me to floss every night now.</li>
    <li> This took a bit of getting used to, but stick to it and it does a great job.  I have braces and this is much easier and quicker than floss threaders. My orthodontist and his assistant have thanked me for keeping my teeth and gums so clean.</li>
    <li> I love it...easy to use..so I will actually use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bad teeth due to some health problems (osteoporosis) and always hated to floss so my gums and teeth have reached a horrific state.  I hope to save them with this miracle flosser, and after 10 days I can say my gums are most definitely better...less redness, puffiness and bleeding.  And fair warning, this flosser has made my gums bleed and badly at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use, fill the small reservoir with water...turn it on, and then push the button.  You settle the nozzle between each tooth at the gumline, spray and then just slide over to the next.  Simple..simple.  Amazingly fast and it works.  I checked with floss afterward and my teeth were clean.  However if you have deep pockets, meat will get stuck in there, and have to be flossed with string.  But I&#x27;ve not had that happen but once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have some sensitivity issues with a few of my top teeth and the force of the water causes me some pain.  The water forces between your teeth but it&#x27;s with such force that if you have a bad tooth, you&#x27;re gonna know it.  I actually cringe before I push the button doing my top teeth.  But my gums have gotten better, so I have hope that eventually all my pain will go away.  I&#x27;ve never used a water pick so not sure how this differs from that, but it&#x27;s definitely much easier and faster than using floss.  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it!  I wish they&#x27;d had this when I was younger...my teeth would not be in the shape they are in right now.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this flosser, but alas, I cannot. This thing is first of all, annoying to use. You have to click a button to expel the water and air each time. But the worst part is that it generally lacks any power at all to shoot the water between your teeth. In general, the majority of times it just builds up pressure between my teeth that is only released once I take it off. For $90, this should work like a song but doesn&#x27;t. It is pretty surprising how flawed of a product it is and how ineffective it is. Returned for refund.</li>
    <li> With the understanding that everyones experience will be different--for myself, this product is AMAZING! After 2 days I have noticed HUGE change--and already, plaque buildup is being blasted away. I also use an electric toothbrush--and the first time I used that I thought my teeth felt so clean. Now, with the Airfloss, it&#x27;s that feeling all over again, but magnified.     For me, I think it does replace flossing--there is no remaining food particles after I use it--but again, this could just be personal experience.    As for those who say it does not deliver enough power, perhaps the reservoir or battery is low--mine blasts with power each time. And as far as stray particles stuck in a tooth--redirection of the nozzle and a blast does the job.    For those who think having to click the device each time is time consuming....it takes about a minute to do your whole mouth. It&#x27;s not annoying at all, and WAY less messy than a water pick.     Overall, I think this is worth every penny and has been one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long while.</li>
    <li> This product works great and is easy to use. I highly recommend it for those lazy flossers out there who know you should be flossing but don&#x27;t You can take care of cleaning between your teeth in around a minute or two. You will wonder how you got along without it.</li>
    <li> I fill mine with vodka. That way, you kill two birds with one stone. Plus, it encourages frequent Airflossing, and my gums have never felt so clean. I also seem to be a lot happier these days.</li>
    <li> The airfloss is good for people that have gaps between their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some spaces between my teeth but heading to the back, my tight are close together.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the device for 2 wks.&lt;br /&gt;I still have to floss between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This defeats the purpose of the airfloss, if I need to floss.&lt;br /&gt;I might as well have been flossing without paying for this expensive device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did a great job between the teeth with gaps.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use</li>
    <li> This sounded like a great idea, but it is actually nowhere near as effective as even a WaterPik.  It shoots a small burst of air and water droplets between the teeth, but with very little power, and certainly without the irrigating effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be much better off to man up, use regular floss, go buy yourself some proxibrushes (and USE them - they are even more effective than flossing), and choose to spend your money on an ultrasonic toothbrush.  In that department, Sonicare truly does excel.</li>
    <li> I love this Airfloss, the idea is very smart and effective. I bought this product and I was not expecting it to do miracles like other reviewers were but I was very pleased and surprised that the machine does clean between the teeth and make your gum healthier.   This machine is more like water pik but less messy, more portable and less time consuming. I am not sure why people kept comparing to regular flossing even though the description didn&#x27;t and I personally think that people should not stop the regular flossing. Basically what this machine does is that it pumps fast bursts of water and air to remove food particles between the teeth, so logically if you think a machine can remove everything like the regular floss you will need something more like the Air Compressor that you use for your tools but you might have to numb your gum before each time!!  In conclusion this machine is a good thing to have if you like to keep your gum clean, and if you are like most people who hate or don&#x27;t have time for regular flossing this Airfloss is definitely for you !!</li>
    <li> Using this product makes my flossing possible and my teeth feel great!  I have MS and flossing was NOT HAPPENING!!!  Now my mouth and gums are in much better shape and I know my Dentist is going to be thrilled!</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple times with this and it&#x27;s not really worth the money. It does not do a very good job, I have tried to use it to get rid of anything stuck between my teeth with no luck. Regular floss does work better by far.</li>
    <li> I am in my late 50s, have ALWAYS had trouble with my teeth, and never get a \\&quot;good\\&quot; review from my dentist, even though I floss daily and try my best to take excellent care of my teeth.  Well, I bought this thing about 3.5 months ago and added it to my routine, and what a difference it has made! I still floss first, then use the Philips flosser, then brush, then mouthwash; takes about six minutes in total.  The result - I just returned from the dentist today after having a routine cleaning and I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am! Having my teeth cleaned is normally an ordeal and takes anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes and is painful.  But this time it took her about eight minutes to complete the entire cleaning and she complimented me on my \\&quot;very clean\\&quot; mouth!  No dentist has ever said that to me before.  She also took gum measurements and said my gums are in excellent condition.  So, the upshot is, if you ADD this to your routine, it could make a real difference.  The old brush routine did not make my mouth feel this clean and did not provide the excellent results I am now getting.</li>
    <li> My wife flosses regularly and really enjoyed the convenience of this quick and flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting the use of high speed that was used to brush teeth could help clean between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well in the back teeth especially, where it is like doing acrobatics to get your hands or fingers to way in the back, finally a solution for the big hands people like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Device looks sleek and I liked the burst action instead of the continuous action of the Waterpik.  The problem we had with the Sonicare Airfloss was that the nozzles could not be removed due to suction issues.  When contacting Philips, they admitted to the problem and could only offer a replacement or suggested returning them to the store.  Second combo pack had the same issue, guess we are not going to buy the Airfloss by Philips unless they re-design their product.  I understand that Waterpick has a quick release for their nozzle, but I personally don&#x27;t care for continuous water delivery method.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, very efficient flosser, quick to charge and I would recommend this to all that find flossing hard</li>
    <li> The product seemed to work okay once I got it.  It unfortunately stopped working completely within two weeks.  Sonicare/Philips said they would send a replacement within two weeks but that two weeks has turned into two months and counting.  Every two weeks they send me an email pushing the shipment date for the replacement back two more weeks.  This is all while they keep shipping new products to the stores.  They are obviously prioritizing selling new products over fixing existing customers problems.  I highly recommend that if you are going to consider this product, wait until bugs are worked out and there is more supply available.</li>
    <li> After all these years, I have found an alternative to the task of flossing. The Sonicare is not only better than flossing (cleaner gums), but is also a lot more fun.</li>
    <li> I believe this not a replacement for flossing, rather it&#x27;s a replacement for NOT flossing.  For many people, flossing is too difficult or uncomfortable, so they simply don&#x27;t do it.  This product is for them.  My left hand became disabled a couple years ago, so I could no longer floss.  Eventually, I started using an Oral-B Vitality electric toothbrush with Floss Action brush head ([[ASIN:B003UKM90Q Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Blue and White]]).  It&#x27;s wonderful to use.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  Recently, I added the Airfloss to my routine each evening.  It&#x27;s pleasant and easy to use, one-handed.  I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s nearly as effective as floss, but I do believe it&#x27;s significantly better than not flossing at all.  Leave it to the dentists, ADA, scientists, or your own dentist to answer this question for sure.  For now, I feel better to have some pleasant feasible alternative to floss.  A water flosser sounds more effective than the Airfloss, but they also look bigger, messier, and more difficult to manage, particularly one-handed.</li>
    <li> At first I didnt drain the excess water from the pump portion of my airfloss. I now do, but either way no matter what it smells like nasty mold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it works too well for removing foor particles from between my teeth. Even immediately after flossing. Granted I still floss as this doesn&#x27;t seem like it totally replaces it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reading below I like the vodka idea and im going to give it a shot. Perhaps it will kill whatever makes it smell terrible.</li>
    <li> I got the AirFloss for Christmas. I was disappointed that I had to charge it for 24-hours because I was so anxious to use it! But, my impatience aside, I liked my first run with this. You fill a small spot in the back with water or mouthwash (I like mouthwash because it feels fresher) and then press a button to turn it on. You stick the tip between two teeth near your gums and press another button that delivers a quick burst of air and water/mouthwash. It&#x27;s not like a waterpik that is a stream, it&#x27;s a very powerful staccato-type burst. I had to laugh at myself the first time I used it because this burst is powerful enough that what mouthwash doesn&#x27;t go through, ricochets off your teeth and in my case splattered all over my mirror and ran down my chin. I recommend trying to close your mouth more to avoid the extra clean-up.  It really only focuses on your teeth near the gums, so I&#x27;m not sure how much it leaves to be desired near the bottom in between of the teeth. I am definitely no dental hygiene expert. It appeared to get out all of the food particles, but I guess the true test will be after I visit the dentist. It was quick. I enjoyed using it. My teeth feel nice. I will post an update after my next dental check-up to see how it stands up to plaque and other unseen menaces.</li>
    <li> We have been using this for approx. two weeks now and are really enjoying it.  I have a small mouth and a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth - both of these things make it extremely hard to floss using traditional flossing methods.  My teeth are really tight together and flossing around my bottom retainer is such a pain so when I saw this product I wanted to give it a try because I know I need to be doing more than just brushing.  (We have a Sonicare toothbrush but still...)  The first time I used it, I definitely noticed a difference.  Before I even brushed my teeth, I could tell the Air Floss had removed some of the gunk on my teeth - especially around the gum line.  Let me be clear though, the first few times you use this, you will most likely spray water/mouth wash all over the place so be prepared with some glass cleaner and paper towels for the mirror!  :0)  (My husband made a huge mess and we got a big laugh out of it!)  It will take a few days but you will figure out the best angle to hold the Air floss to minimize this.  Also, I really love using the mouthwash with it - feels extra fresh.    I&#x27;m guessing those that are diligent about flossing traditionally would not benefit from this product like I do but for someone like me, this is much better than brushing alone.</li>
    <li> It works pretty good but you have to use it 2 or 3 times between teeth to remove all debris</li>
    <li> First if floss gets stuck between your teeth, this product doesn&#x27;t have enough pressure to clear between the teeth.  The pressure just remains trapped until you pull away the nozzle, then the pressure is released spraying everywhere.  Secondly, they say you can use mouthwash in the reservoir, but after a break from using the air flosser, the air burst works, but it is failing to draw any fluid from the reservoir.  I believe the feed line is blocked by dried up mouthwash or mineral build up.</li>
    <li> Received this item very quickly. Already a Sonicare toothbrush user, I was interested in this approach to flossing.  Received the item and charged for first use as indicated in the instructions.  It worked really great!  Seemed to be more effective than regular flossing, and a lot faster and neater. However, after the first couple uses the battery died.  The unit will not recharge, and the innards are not accessible.  I will be sending it back. Would like another, but really don&#x27;t know about the battery and charging system.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> like very much, better than a toothbrush, mouth cleaner; easy to use and travel with, holds charge about two weeks with 2X daily use.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare DiamondClean is FANTASTIC! This is my first electric toothbrush and I have to say it is by far one of the best things I could ever buy for healthy hygiene.  I went from brushing generic hand-mode once a day to brushing at least two (2) times a day (OR more).  Why?  Because every time I brush my teeth I feel like I just left the hygienist. My teeth look clean and it definitely has a strong brush technique that reaches in hard-to-reach areas.  The handle is sleek and comfortable to maneuver around in your mouth.  I tried all modes and my favorite is the white or clean mode. The gum mode is really good, too.  I have been using the DiamondClean tooth brush for one month now and I have to say my teeth are looking much brighter and whiter than ever. At this rate, I have a strong belief my teeth will get whiter over continued use.  There is one minor fault in the design of the on-and-off switch, but I find using this technique works quite well when brushing (and my hygienist does something similar).  Apply the toothpaste onto the brush, then before starting the toothbrush, rub the toothpaste with the brush onto your teeth, wet the toothbrush in the faucet, then start the brush in your mouth. This technique works quite well.  Otherwise, you might be cleaning toothpaste spots quite a bit on your mirror and/or wall.  Overall, I highly, most highly recommend it. A++</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  The water chamber needs to hold tons more water. It doesn&#x27;t even hold enough for one use on all your teeth.</li>
    <li> The water reservoir is far too small.  Requires constant refilling.  The trigger does not keep flossing when depressed.  Must keep pressing and releasing the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;Get a waterpic instead.</li>
    <li> Seems to be less painfull then flossing... I have an area that no matter how often I floss, it&#x27;s just sensitive. I don&#x27;t have this problem with this thing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a month ago from the internet.  I started using the product and was unable to remove much of anything from my teeth (I have very tight spaces between my teeth).  I do much better using something like glide floss which is very flat and slides between my teeth easily. I decided to try and use this product instead of flossing for an entire month.  The power of the spray is relatively weak for someone with tight spaces in thier teeth.  Maybe they should make the spray power adjustable for different types of teeth. I had a dental appointment a month after using the Airfloss.  While the hygenist was cleaing and flossing my teeth, she told me that my gums were bleeding.  She was concerned because they had never bled before and asked if I was brushing or flossing less.  I told her that I had switched to this Airfloss product.   She then told me to stop using it and see if I could return it, as the health of my gums was on the decline.  She also gave me this Crest Gum Care toothpaste and told me to use the entire tube to help restore the heslth of my gums quicker.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and I really love it!  I use mouthwash in the receptacle and my mouth feels so clean afterwards.  I have tightly spaced teeth and it is so much easier to floss now and I usually floss twice a day now. I do have some sensitivity in the front of my mouth where I have an old cap so I just don&#x27;t use it there. I am so glad that Philips came up with this clever and affordable device!</li>
    <li> Some people are complaining that they still have to floss.  Crazy this is not a replacement but addition to your oral care. I do admit I don&#x27;t floss as often as I used to.  But the way to go is floss then use your AirFloss to wash out what was there.&lt;br /&gt; Gum stimulation is a big problem for lots of people.  The unit is great for that.  I use this with my mouth wash insteam of gargaling and love it.  Went to the dentist after 6 months and got a 5 star review.  I would recomend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> After my 3rd one, niether lasted longer than a few weeks. For the 3rd time this product just stopped working. I will be sending this product back in the morning and getting a refund. I will not be purchasing another one. Clearly there are some serious issues with this product that this company has refused to address. Anyone thinking about buying one of these ,STAY AWAY!</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised at the effectiveness of this device. I was not looking for something to replace flossing and/or brushing nor do deep cleaning. I just needed something to blow out the material that accumulated between a few of my teeth (particularly rear molars) and to do so with a minimum of preparation and water spray/spillage in using the device. I&#x27;m in a situation where I can conveniently use it several times a day (e.g., after meals, etc.) and I do so. A fine product that I can highly recommend as long as you&#x27;re not trying to replace flossing and/or brushing but just need a way to remove debris between the teeth at other times.</li>
    <li> My teeth are VERY close together, and flossing is always difficult for me. I was skeptical that this device could actually get between my teeth.  BUT it works!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and I&#x27;m very pleased. My battle with floss and bleeding gums has ended! As you use it, then spit/rinse, there are definitely food particles coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;spray&#x27; is actually part air, part water. The water reservoir doesn&#x27;t hold a lot, so sometimes I have to refill it during flossing. But not too much of a hassle. The built in battery recharges quickly and seems to hold a charge a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first start using it, you kind of have to learn how to keep your mouth somewhat closed, or you end up making a giant mess on your bathroom mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side--my kids think it makes an awesome water gun!  So I have trouble keeping it away from them, LOL.</li>
    <li> The nozzle on the Airfloss is impossible to remove without tools.&lt;br /&gt;Removal is required for cleaning and for sharing the unit. Removal is also highly recommended when packing the unit for travel as the nozzle is slender and needs protection. Pulling hard on the Airfloss nozzle fails to release it. Pulling harder .. the nozzle breaks cleanly along a decorative part of the lower molding. The stub remains in the handle. Pliers are then needed to remove the stub. Currently replacement nozzles are quite expensive. Furthermore travelling with pliers in your carry aboard luggage will result in their confiscation. Result. If you travel a lot.. you may as well stick to flossing. I consider this a serious product defect most especially for the traveller or for a family considering sharing a single unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE  Decided to give it up entirely. Flossing &amp; brushing were required anyway so the Airfloss has gone into the junk pile. Frankly I think the product sucks and is quite useless. I thought I might keep it around and use it for cleaning engine parts but it failed to dislodge anything other than that I could just flick off with a brush. Sad to see that ingenious engineers and product marketing folk at Phillips could come up with such a crock.</li>
    <li> I am 63 years old and try every new dental product including most Sonicare products (the best product I have found so far is the Hydrabrush which is not from Sonicare)    The Airfloss is certainly unique: it has a thimble sized reservoir and shoots bursts of air and water (or mouthwash) each time the activation button is pressed: the bursts are fairly strong. When i first went to fill it, I thought something was wrong as it would not take but a few drops of water: that is all it is designed to hold!  I prefer filling with  mouthwash instead of water.    My teeth are very close together and the first time I used it my gums bled: but i could feel the burst&#x27;s effectiveness for cleaning.    It is only for use on the outside of the teeth: that may be all you need as it is so powerful, but if you have tight teeth it may do more harm than good...so love it or hate it it is an interesting approach: I am still trying to decide.    I would have preferred an adjustment feature for the strength of the burst and a larger reservoir: perhaps Airfloss II will address that?</li>
    <li> Item arrived on August 12th.  I follow instructions to let it charge for 24 hours. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for 4 days. Woke up this morning (August 17th) and turned on the Airfloss...however the nothing.I thought it was out of battery so I put it on the charger and it started flashing green and orange. I went to work and left it on the charger.  Came home a couple hours ago, turned it on, and still nothing.  When I place it back on the charger it starts to flash green and orange again.  I tried looking through the manual to see what the flashing means, however nothing.  A quick search online reveals nothing as well for this product is so new.      Well, I had a good 4 days (not 5 because I let it charge for 24 hours per the instructions) out of it. I have been a user and fan of the Sonicare Flexcare Toothbrush for about 2years now.  I had high expectations with this new product and am really disappointed that it failed after 4 days.  Good thing I can still return it within the 28 day period.</li>
    <li> I am editing this review after having had the product and used it regularly for over 3 years.  I am leaving my original review below as it was originally written because it talks about how the product performed for a novice user, versus how I expected it to perform based on product description.  All of my comments in the original review are still accurate.  I have edited this review to upgrade it from 3 to 5 stars, because despite a few issues that didn&#x27;t perform quite as well as originally expected, it definitely gets the job done.  I have to spray the nozzle anywhere from 1 to 4 times between each tooth, depending on how tight the gaps between those particular teeth are.  I have to refill the reservoir once half way through, which isn&#x27;t too inconvenient.  After adjusting the number of sprays for my particular teeth, I find that the AirFloss works very, very well.  As someone who rarely flossed, I still, after 3 years, regularly use the Airfloss --- although perhaps not always daily.  I whole-heartedly recommend this product to anyone.  Replacement nozzles can be a little tough to find in stores, but they can be ordered on Amazon pretty readily.    Here is my orginal review from 2011:       I love my sonicare toothbrush and was very excited to see this product.  I have very good teeth in general, but always get flack from my dentist about not flossing.  I brush with my sonicare twice a day but I am a very sporadic flosser at best (1-3 times/month max.). I know I should floss, but just find it to be such a hassle.    I&#x27;ve been using the Airfloss for a week now --- typically twice a day.  Here are my thoughts thus far:    1. The directions indicate to give it one shot between each tooth.  This was not effective for me.  I follwed it with floss and the floss removed a LOT of particles left behind by the airflosser. However, if I spray it 3 times between each tooth, it actually does a pretty good job of getting out most of the food particles. Its still not 100%, but itis very good and much better for me than not flossing at all.  The downside is that you definitely will have to refill the reservoir at least once when using.  I have pretty tight gaps between my teeth which likely has some effect on the performance.    2.  In general it is very user friendly, however it will take a little getting used to to get the head lined up between the teeth. If its lined up right, you can feel the burst come between the teeth and hit your tounge.  If its not quite right you can get a little splash or if its completely blocked it doesn&#x27;t spray at all. I&#x27;m getting the swing of it. If you don&#x27;t get the spray right, it doesn&#x27;t clean well.    3.  It&#x27;s not quite as neat as I would have liked. I get a bit of dribble, but no where near the mess of a waterpik.    4.  Works well with both mouth rinse and water.  Whether shooting the stuff between your teeth has more benefit than just rinsing your mouth when done, I don&#x27;t know.    Overall, I like it. I will continue using it. After 1 week I see a difference in my teeth.  They look and feel much cleaner.  I see huge potential benefits for people who do not floss or are sporadic flossers like me.  If you are a habitual flosser now, you are probably already getting a better cleaning than this gadget will give you.    I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I think it performed well, but not as well as advertised.    I add another review after I&#x27;ve been using it a while longer.  My next Dentist cleaning is still about 4 months off, so that will be a good test to see how my cleaning goes after using it for a while. I&#x27;ll be sure to report back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Airfloss for a week now and I can certainly tell the difference in my gums. I realize that the device does not replace flossing, but with the Airfloss I actually enjoy cleaning my teeth two times a day!!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend who is a dentist.  I got one for my Mother... She is 90 with arthritis in her hands so it&#x27;s hard for her to work a lot of things... this product is so easy to use that she had no problem at all filling it, turning it off/on and using it.  Then my husband wanted one and then I got one for myself.  It takes a little practice to position correctly and you need to repeat the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; multiple times occasionally, but it&#x27;s a great little product.  Really great if you have \\&quot;special\\&quot; mouth wash for your gums as you can just use that instead of water.</li>
    <li> Airfloss is SO convenient!!  Flossing takes a few seconds and its just as effective as the traditional way.  All you need to remember is to hold it firmly against your teeth when clicking down and your all set to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used waterjet floss as I wear braces and was hoping this airfloss will make less mess than the waterjet ones - but it didn&#x27;t!  My mirror is a mess! and because the airfloss doesn&#x27;t do a continuous action, so you have aim at the space in between your teeth, the press for the air to come out - so a mirror is definitely needed but once the air comes out, it made huge splashes on the mirror...  Would return this item if I could!</li>
    <li> So my waterpik hose broke and I decided to try the Philips Airfloss...first off, this blows air and water in a puff...its exactly like the  sudden air puff you get when they are checking you for glaucoma...suddenly in your eye. After,,,1 minute of use, my gums were bleeding  intensely.  There is no pressure adjustment, only tap the top and it hits you suddenly....The bleeding was similar to a teeth cleaning.  I never had this problem with the waterpik,, as it has 10 levels of intensity and it constantly shoots water your way...it does a much  better job of disloging food between your teeth...I will be returning this item. My advice, stay away from this item its horrible.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested this product, have had it a few weeks and it is working fine.  Really gets the food particles out of the pockets between my teeth.I will update this if any problems arise.  I sure hope it is better then the Krups coffee pot I purchased on amazon which has been sent back twice for repairs and they still have it -talk about wasteing 150.00 dollars</li>
    <li> I love this - it makes cleaning between my teeth a breeze. The device squirts water quite forcefully between your teeth, and is very quick and simple to use and really leaves your mouth feeling clean. I find that I still have to use floss now and again to clean where my teeth are actually touching each other, as the water won&#x27;t get there</li>
    <li> No idea if it is going to make my next dental check up any better but it feels so cool that I really don&#x27;t care. My hygienist told me that I needed to start using a water pic which I told her I would, knowing that there was no way it was going to happen. Then I was in CVS and saw this. It looked cool enough so I decided to bite the bullet. Got it home, filled it with Listerine and tried it. All I can say is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s awesome and I can&#x27;t see where it could hurt so why not use it. My only complaint is that the liquid reservoir could be bigger because it runs out after about 2 uses. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Air Floss is an amazing product. I&#x27;m not going to review the product in depth as many other reviewers have already done so.   It seems like many people are comparing the Air Floss to actual flossing. I work at a dental office and have had many discussions with our Sonicare representatives - the Air Floss was never meant to replace flossing...it is meant for patients that are not regularly flossing and most likely never will get into the habit of flossing despite a hygienist&#x27;s reminders every office visit.   Chances are you know someone guilty of not flossing twice a day much less twice a week. This is the perfect gift for that someone as this bridges the gap by providing a quick and easy method for improving his/her oral healthcare. Let&#x27;s be real, flossing is a pita and not everyone is going to do it. There have also been complaints about the small reservoir that the Air Floss has which is actually intentional. If it didn&#x27;t run dry in two full uses, that would give microorganisms the opportunity to grow at an alarming rate in a larger reservoir that took longer to clear out.   Cleaning is a breeze, if you use water, just use Listerine. If you use Listerine, just use water. If you&#x27;re not flossing, you should at least be air flossing.</li>
    <li> Sonicare Air Flosser is a great tool to add to your tooth care regimen. With each click of the button, you get a burst of air with droplets of liquid. I use mouthwash in the liquid reservior, for extra germ killing features.  It is amazing what it removes from in between your teeth after you have brushed. Not messy and convenient to use. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Airfloss for only a month. It gives out a powerful blast and if not carefully&lt;br /&gt;aimed it will hurt. There is no way I can determine whether or not it is effective. Only my dentist&lt;br /&gt;will be able to tell me. I seriously doubt it will take the place of regular dental floss but decided&lt;br /&gt;to try the Airfloss because I dislike flossing. I suspect that the Airfloss is only good for removing&lt;br /&gt;food particles and since I use a Waterpik irrigator I suspect I am wasting my time. If it actually works&lt;br /&gt;well enough to replace flossing I would give it 5 stars. It was about as effective as my Waterpik, perhaps a little more. The battery died after one year. I got warranty service quickly on 9/14/12, however I have not received the replacement I was promised. It has been back ordered several times. The latest scheduled arrival date is 10/23/12. 39 days! That is pathedic! Lasting only one year is bad enough but then waiting so long for a replacement! I can&#x27;t recommend this item at all!</li>
    <li> I did not like because it cleans the teeth by removing the waste.The jet of water is weak and also the liquid just fast.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I have been a steadfast advocate of Philips Sonicare products and have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for over 10 years now... but this Airfloss is the biggest disappointment I have ever experienced from a Sonicare product.    The unit just feels poorly and cheaply designed and is way overpriced for what you&#x27;re getting.    The water reservoir is incredibly small and the latch does not have a \\&quot;click\\&quot; mechanism to indicate the reservoir latch has sealed and is properly closed.  The unit does not come with a travel case.  Most importantly this product will never / should never replace flossing as Sonicare markets it.  After use, you will find you still have food residue left between your teeth requiring conventional floss so don&#x27;t bother wasting your time or money with this... you will be highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Using this product is no better than swishing water around in your mouth. I can&#x27;t believe they call it flossing. I like my Sonicare toothbrush, and frankly this Airfloss product tarnishes the brand&#x27;s good name. If you read the description carefully, they are careful to say it is an improvement over brushing alone, which means if you didn&#x27;t floss at all you&#x27;re better off doing this. That may be true, but then the product shouldn&#x27;t pretend to be a flossing substitute or related to flossing at all.  The truth is flossing gets rid of things under the gumline, and this product only affects food particles in the exposed spaces between teeth above the gums. If you are looking for an easier way to floss but still clean under the gumline, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> This product was a godsend for me, as I got braces at the age of 43 and found much frustration in keeping my teeth and braces clean. As a fanatical flosser, having braces in the way was a real downer. Then along came this product and I was thrilled. I ordered it immediately and used it twice a day...until it just one day stopped working, after only 2 months of use. After some back and forth with the Philips company, they sent me another one. Again, I was happy, using it twice a day. Until THIS one also stopped working after four months. No, I haven&#x27;t contacted Philips again, though I likely will, but I&#x27;m starting to think, why bother? I really don&#x27;t expect another one to last much longer, and it&#x27;s just a hassle to go through the process of contacting them to get them to honor the warranty. So as I said, I *would* love the product...if only it was reliable.</li>
    <li> I wish I could have given this a better rating! The device itself was great. My husband and I were using it daily along with mouthwash, and it simply did not work any more after about 3 weeks of use. It wasn&#x27;t dropped or mishandled, and it would charge and power up, but the \\&quot;trigger\\&quot; button just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed in what was shaping up to be a great tool.</li>
    <li> I was excited about the air flosser but, the the excitement didnt last . The air flosser quit working in less then a month . I don&#x27;t know why but, it wouldn&#x27;t charge .</li>
    <li> I just bought a Sonicare toothbrush and the Sonicare Airfloss. My husband has recently been diagnosed with a degenerative memory disorder. This aparently now causes him to \\&quot;remember\\&quot; he has just brushed his teeth when he actually hasn&#x27;t. He is a diabetic and, well.... Let&#x27;s just say he was recently complaining of tooth pain and we discovered at the emergency dentist visit that his gums were swiftly sliding into problemville.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that with the Airfloss and Sonicare brush we can reverse this slide. Further, these two products - and especially the Airfloss - will allow me to more easily do his oral care for him when that time comes. And it WILL eventually come...  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as we use the Airfloss. The 3 stars reflects only the fact that this is, essentially, an unfinished review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has not yet tried the Airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have tried the Airfloss myself tonight. First use. It was an odd sensation. Nowhere near as messy as a Waterpic. It does create a relatively loud and jarring puff of water and air. This may be a problem for some people. I got used to it pretty quickly and found it wasn&#x27;t really a problem.&lt;br /&gt;Because of my husband&#x27;s illness he became unemployable, and so I have been without dental insurance for a couple of years. I&#x27;ve been relatively good about brushing and flossing, but it&#x27;s been a LOOoooong time since my teeth have had a proper dental hygenist cleaning. The Airfloss knocked some solid chunks of plaque off my teeth. Big chunks. That alone might be enough to recomend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my full review will cover wether or not this is a good product to use for cleaning another person&#x27;s teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> Product worked well for about two months, then internal tank leaked.  When I added water it ran somewhere inside and unit stopped working.</li>
    <li> This product is total waste of good, hard-earned money. I am on my second Sonicare, the first one having stopped working and being unable to hold its charge. I contacted the company and they told me to send it back and promised to replace it, which they did--with another one that also stopped working after a while. The problem is in the charging--it will not hold its charge. I contacted the company a second time and a curt representative told me that they were not having problems with this product. I told him that in fact they were, because there were negative reviews all over the Internet about this product. Again he told me to send it back and expect a replacement. When this flosser works, it works wonderfully. I loved it when it worked, but the problem is that it doesn&#x27;t work for very long before it goes kaput. At a cost of nearly $90, this product should work consistently. Buyer beware. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this product.</li>
    <li> My husband isn&#x27;t an avid flosser and his dentist has even talked to me to try to determine why he has so much trouble with his teeth.  I found the Sonicare Airflosser here on Amazon and called to talk to the dentist about it.  Our dentist didn&#x27;t know much about it but I decided to give it a try anyway.  My husband loves the way this makes his mouth feel like he has just had his teeth professionally cleaned.  I will follow up later to let you know if his dental reports improve.  Product Review Update:  After less than one month&#x27;s use my husband went to his quarterly teeth cleaning appointment.  The hygenist said she saw quite a bit of improvement and talked to the dentist to look into this produce for his other problem patients.  This seems to be money well spent.</li>
    <li> I have seen this item in many retail stores this Holiday Shopping season and I thought I would purchase it as a gift.  Most retail stores want $125+ for this item so when I saw it on Amazon for $79 I was cautious but went ahead and placed the order.  The item arrived and is everything I had hoped it would be and it was a hit as a present.  Beats me why anyone would buy it any other place.  The same is true of watch batteries which I seem to need a lot of lately.  I can buy 5 of them on amazon for what one costs me a Walgreens, Target or Walmart.  No shipping charge makes the decision to buy easy...</li>
    <li> I have used a water pik for many years now so thought I would try the airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine seems well built and the battery charge lasts a good while.  However it takes some exact skill to use, it can hurt if not exactly aimed, and I question how effective it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the instructions, after charging, and filling the very small reservoir with water, you push the button (which is almost the entire top surface) six times to prime the machine.  Then you place the nozzle between your teeth and push once for each space between teeth.  The devise sends a strong jet of water and air.  If the jet hits your tongue it can hurt slightly and it feels at times as if it might be able to blast a crown off also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the nozzle is not exactly positioned I do not thing it does much. I have two teeth which have a large space between them and I think it has no effect on that area as the space to large to concentrate the blast force. As the blast is only a brief second, there is no time to move the device to cover a larger area while it is blasting. It only covers the area where it is positioned when you push the button.  As such I do not thing the device works on the gums except between two normally spaced teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a test I brushed my teeth as usual, used the airfloss then used my regular water pik.  I found that even after using the airfloss, my regular water pik was removing particles that the airflosser missed.  My unofficial test made me wonder if it did any good at all.  The jarring made me not want to use it anywhere near my crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are happy using a water pik type device, I would save your money and keep using what you have</li>
    <li> I originally wanted to by this product to avoid using regular dental floss. It&#x27;s tedious and can hurt your gums... This Sonicare makes flossing a breeze, very easy to use and quite efficient especially in hard to reach spots!</li>
    <li> Stay away from this product. First, it&#x27;s not a replacement for real flossing. I tried to just use this device for flossing for a couple months, after which I decided to try the real floss again to see if my gums would bleed. Boy! Did they ever! Needless to say, I returned to the old fashioned way of flossing to toughen the gums once again. This device should only be used as in addition to your regular flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, since this Airfloss stopped working after a couple more months, it became completely worthless.</li>
    <li> As a dental hygienist who tried this product for a few days I can honestly say DON&#x27;T waste your money on this!  Doesn&#x27;t work for those with tight contacts  Doesn&#x27;t get below gum line  DOES NOT Replace FLOSSING!  And if you have perio issues-get a waterpik instead!  Why would you add another gadget to brushing and flossing and mouth rinse?  Especially if a waterpik is recommended too?  This pointless gadget will just promote bad oral hygiene.</li>
    <li> Product is acceptable but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase another. The air mist pushes food from between teeth but your mouth doesn&#x27;t feel right until you floss.</li>
    <li> The air floss is easy to use and convenient.  It holds a charge for about two weeks, and is easily recharged over night.  Sharon</li>
    <li> We received the 2 Philips Sonicare HX8181/02 Airfloss, Rechargeable Electric Flosser&lt;br /&gt;December of 2011 one for my wife and one for myself. We both loved the product until my flosser stopped working yesterday 2-29-2012.I have know idea what i did with the paperwork so have no way to return.</li>
    <li> We got this because our dentist recommended it.  My teeth are very close together and regular waxed floss works fine.  This isn&#x27;t able to get between most of my teeth and I end up having to manually floss anyways.  There isn&#x27;t any way to tone-down the pressure to get kids used to it.  My kids are afraid to use it.  :(</li>
    <li> Stopped functioning after 2 weeks. Doesn&#x27;t do the job very well. Uses fluid not air to clean. Fluid reservoir leaks and is too small. Not ready for market, needs lots of tweaks.</li>
    <li> It was fun to use, but didn&#x27;t replace flossing, got water all over the place, and it broke 6 months after purchase.  Costs almost as much to fix as to replace.  I&#x27;ll do neither.</li>
    <li> I used my airfloss for a few weeks before it stopped working. It would turn on but immediately turn off when I tried to use it. I swapped out the charger as a test but this made no difference. The green charge light still indicated a full charge to no avail. Called Philips. Eventually got to a human after an afternoon of persistence. Described my issue and was told a new unit would be shipped out. This never arrived. My guess is they hope the idea of spending additional hours fighting my way to a human will not be worth the effort. Also, the product itself kind of sucks even when it was working.</li>
    <li> Received products with the perfect condition. All items received as stated in the product description. Delivery was fast and on schedule. All products work well and fully function.</li>
    <li> I have awkward teeth which makes flossing tricky, I saw this on the gadget show and decided to give it a go, in general I have found it to be more effective than regular flossing in that tends to blast things out rather then push things deeper or just move them around which can happen with regular flossing. That said there have been occasions when regular flossing has got things out that the air floss hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary I would use the air floss on a regular basis and normal floss when you think you have something really stuck that the air floss didn&#x27;t get out. On my last check up my dentist commented that my gums were in good shape something he has never said before, after a brief discussion he is all for using it but still recommends the occasional flossing as it can scrape off stuff that is stuck to the teeth</li>
    <li> There just isn&#x27;t enough pressure to remove anything.  VERY hard to get to back teeth - which need the most flossing.  Tried to like it, but just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Might as well take the time to floss correctly.</li>
    <li> Bought this because my Braun stopped working.  What I was looking for is something similar to a Waterpik, that has adjustable settings.  You know the kind, with a tank for extended cleaning.  Once I got this Sonicare, I charged it for twenty fours according to directions.  I then attached the head, turned it on and pressed the button six times just like the instructions said.  I then inserted it into my mouth and again pressed the button five or six times while moving the tip around inside my mouth.  My gums started bleeding immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit produces too much pressure to be used in the mouth, in my opinion, and you cannot adjust it.  The unit is very noisy, holds only two tablespoons of water or cleaning solution and cannot be adjusted.  There is no continuous operation of the tip.  All you get is a \\&quot;burst\\&quot; of water and air each time you press the operating button.  Not satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned it after only a few uses.  This thing scares me.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product, easy to use, and does a great job at flossing.  My husband would never floss - though it was too much trouble.  Now he uses this airflosser all the time.  We&#x27;ve both had improved dental checkups since using the Philips Sonicare Airflosser.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these, one for home and one for my frequent business travel, at $90 a piece. One stopped working in 6 weeks, just clicking and not having any output.  I contacted Phillips and they had a long list of things that they wanted to make sure I knew about using the flosser.  Was it fully charged, did I leave any liquid in it for very long, did I hold it more than 85 degrees upright, etc.... etc....  I suggested it was a bad design and instead of fixing the design they made a bunch of rules you has to follow.  It has been 90 days and I asked for a refund because it is not practical to use with all the rules.  I asked for a refund but they said time has expired. So they designed a bad product and will not stand behind it.  BEWARE, it does not work as advertised.  I am going back to the portable WaterPik.</li>
    <li> My son hates flossing and now that he has braces it is even worse!  Decided to try this because I had seen it at the store while picking up sonicare brushes.  What a terrific buy!  He gets food stuck in the braces or in his teeth and just shoots it right out with this.  He actually uses this regularly (unlike floss)and whenever he feels something stuck without me pestering!  I would highly recommend for the use with braces.  I used it myself a couple of times and it does a pretty good job but I still prefer to use floss nightly.</li>
    <li> It looks nice but it doesn&#x27;t clean well between your teeth. It is especially worthless if you have crowded teeth. I returned this product for the Waterpik Ultra, which I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have very tight spaces between teeth, and every type of floss I tried would get stuck....I even had to resort to prising broken floss out with a pair of pliers before!  I still tried my best to floss every day, but it was time consuming and painful...and required a tool box to be kept handy.  This air flosser makes the world of difference...I fill it with mouthwash and my teeth feel wonderful and clean afterwards.  It&#x27;s also pretty great for cleaning jewelry with too....blasts the dirt out of all the nooks and crannies and those small spaces behind your diamonds....finding that mouthwash works just as good as a jewelry cleaner ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this Airflosser because I liked the idea of it - a simple electric rechargeable device that blasts the food from between your teeth without you having to place your fingers in your mouth or use floss.  It uses either tap water or mouthwash, and each time you press the button on top, it delivers a forceful blast of air and water.  I paid $99 for it at Costco.  After charging it for the recommended 24 hrs, I read the instructions which clearly stated one fill of water would be enough for two uses - this turned out to be an understatement - one fill may last for one use but that&#x27;s all.  Second, it really did not remove food particles between my teeth very well.  I have close-set teeth and typically floss at least twice daily using dental tape, but the airflosser fails to compare.  I still ended up flossing after using the airflosser.  Third, the airflosser is fun to use, and I even think it would be a great idea if it worked well and if it didn&#x27;t create a huge mess with each use.  I had to clean my mirror as it creates a blast of water which, once it hits your teeth, splatters everywhere.  I am returning mine.  Nice try though Phillips.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this thing.  I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  I floss everyday at least once.  I have a Viajet that I love, but since it is a bit big, I wanted to try a small and very portable unit like the Airfloss.  It is smart looking, space saving and easy to use.  The only problem is that I hate it.  It shoots a puff of water and air when you push the button with a whirr and a bang.  To reach another tooth - another button push with a whirr and bang.  I thought something was wrong with it so I tried the other one in the box - and that is the way it works.  I was expecting something like the dental jet units, which I feel give me better results, are easier to direct and give me more time to get the job done .  I can add mouthwash to those tank units and get a really great clean mouth feel. Anything that promotes dental health is wonderful, so I hope it sells well and the buyers use it.  Mine is going back to the store.</li>
    <li> We bought this product via a recommendation from our dentist.  The unit worked very well for the first three months.  Then it quit working and now, over a month later, I am still trying to get a replacement from Philips.  They keep promising that it will ship in the next few days but no luck.  It has been over a month now and the same answer keeps coming from their people. I will probably buy the Panasonic EW-DJ10A Portable Oral Irrigator based on their reviews.</li>
    <li> not a waterflosser like I used to have. This shoots out little droplets, not a steady heavy stream. not worth your money</li>
    <li> I will make this brief. On most of my teeth, I found the unit to do the job nicely. It actually felt like I had flossed. However, I have some teeth that are quite close together and the unit really wasn&#x27;t able to get in and clean those areas. Using floss, I have to work in those tight spots so I can&#x27;t say I am surprised. I would say that if you really have trouble flossing, give this a shot. But for the price they&#x27;re asking, this doesn&#x27;t offer anything beyond regular flossing.</li>
    <li> Totally useless, does not floss. I would say waste of money.I would recommend that you use the old manual way that really works.</li>
    <li> Amazon was kind enough to ship me the product a few days before the posted availability date. My first impression is that this device gets the outside of your gums and the exterior gaps of your teeth very clean. The instructions in the box say the Airfloss should only be used on the outside of your teeth. I think this is because of the angle the tip has on it and you must hold the unit upright to operate. I am noticing my lower gums (especially) are now looking very healthy, and this is only after about 10 days&#x27; use. This product absolutely beats traditional floss.</li>
    <li> September 16th update: About a week ago, I noticed that the unit was not getting a full charge when I put it back on its charging stand.  Over the last couple of days it stopped charging altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I call Philips North America&#x27;s customer support center and described the problem. They are sending me a new unit and asking me to return the defective unit back to them (which is what I was hoping they would do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, their normal 7-10 business day scheduled arrival time is going to be longer as the unit is on back order.  :-/  So I probably don&#x27;t have usage of this device for a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hind sight, I should have contacted Amazon and asked for a new unit through them, given it was less than 30 days old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Net:  4-5 stars for the functionality of the device when it is charged. I really like this product. But I can only rate this 3 stars now given the non-charging issue and the long delay in getting a replacement product from the Manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 9th update:  I have had this product for 3 days now.  This has done a good job and has kept my interspaces clean and I don&#x27;t dread the experience as I did with floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 30th update:  My \\&quot;dental professional\\&quot; (as Philips has labeled my dentist and his hygienist) did not give any endorsement to this product as they still recommend daily flossing.  I also have determined that the Airfloss does little to prevent tarter/plaque buildup inside the lower incisors.</li>
    <li> I just want to comment, i got mine today after seeing it on \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot; and i&#x27;m impressed so far..  My gums feel much cleaner after just one use, but i cannot compare it to flossing because i usually cannot get myself to floss regularly (it&#x27;s such a hassle).  This seems so much easier by comparison..  I don&#x27;t know who said they squirted their mirror with it, but on my first use not a drop spilled out of my mouth (other than when i spit) so i cannot imagine how they were holding it when they used it -- my guess is it didn&#x27;t work well for them because they didn&#x27;t read the instructions (heck i didn&#x27;t either - i saw it demonstrated on tv by a dentist who recommended it though said it&#x27;s not as good as flossing but if you don&#x27;t floss this is much better than nothing).</li>
    <li> Flossing is fast and effective. Makes morning and evening routine a snap. Can use water, mouthwash or peroxide in it.</li>
    <li> First of all, I must disclose that I work in the Healthcare/ Dental industry. I encounter a lot people everyday who need to floss more or wish flossing was easier, including myself. It should be noted that this is not a form of advice in any way or matter, the opinions here are just my personal thoughts on the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gums, bleeding and Flossing&lt;br /&gt;gums bleed if bacteria grows in the form of plaque on your teeth. Bacteria uses calcium from you saliva to form plaque. Plaque/Calculus form on all surfaces of the teeth and is easily removed by brushing. The problem is with plaque that forms under the gum and in between the teeth. Your body tries to kill the bacteria by pumping more blood to the gums to fight it (inflammation) and thus gums bleed.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other oral irrigation devices:&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Waterpik for a couple of years and was a little skeptical when I first used the Sonicare. As apposed to the Waterpik, the Sonicare air flosser uses interrupted air/water mist to clean between the teeth. Waterpik uses a continuous jet stream. I was skeptical because the reservoir in the waterpik is 210ml and the air flosser holds about a table spoon full. More about that later.&lt;br /&gt;How it works:&lt;br /&gt;The concept is that if you push water hard enough through the spaces between teeth the water stream will carry with it any food or debris that are stuck there and thus less food for the bacteria to grow on. There is a major difference between that and brushing/flossing. When you floss or brush, you interrupt the formation of plaque. So no the air flosser will not remove plaque. Here is where the air flosser will work, the more food you have between your teeth, the more resources the bacteria will have to form plaque and calculus. by using the air flosser you slow down this process.&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;I use a mouth wash to fill it up instead of water in the hope that some of that will be retained between my teeth and kill bacteria that is growing there.&lt;br /&gt;you take the tip and fit it interproximally between 2 teeth from the outside (labial: lip side) and activate, move to the next 2 teeth and repeat until you do the whole mouth. I activate the water jet twice for every space from the lip side and once from the tongue side (lingual). sonicare does not recommend this because they are afraid that you might over do it and damage your gums. I dont advocate it either so do at your own risk. I just dont feel one pump will remove everything. Now this is a problem for me because  I find I have to fill up the reservoir 2 or 3 times to do the whole mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Many people complain that it makes a mess, but with time it will become easy, just keep your mouth closed.&lt;br /&gt;Who is it and is it not for:&lt;br /&gt;If you use floss and do it regularly then this is not for you. what you are doing is way better habit.&lt;br /&gt;If you have tight contacts, you know because when you eat meat nothing sticks between your teeth, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;Now if you have wide contacts, and you know because you cant eat a taco without reaching for anything to clean between your teeth, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;If you tried flossing and you really cant get yourself to do it no matter what, then this is for you and way better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;If your gums bleed every time you brush or floss then pushing some of that mouthwash in there might actually help by reducing the number of bacteria and the food available for it to grow.&lt;br /&gt;When you go to your dentist and get a deep cleaning, the dentist uses a sonic instrument to disrupt the plaque and to break it down. This is ultimately what you need if your gums bleed. once the plaque is gone and you floss/brush/air floss, the formation of plaque is inhibited and your gums live happy, bacteria free.</li>
    <li> Ok, this is better than not flossing at all.  But it does not really do the job that I was hoping.  It does not clean as well as it should for that price.  I do hate flossing and was hoping this would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for two weeks and have gone back to flossing.  I might use this just to clean after eating from time to time.  It sort of does that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a child who just will not floss, they might use this and it would be better than nothing.  But if you are thinking of not flossing, I would not recommend it as a substitute.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond and used it for about a month before returning it. There are several reasons for that. First, it leaked. You have to put about a tablespoon full of liquid in to a reservoir located just below the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; and it leaked fluid from the first use &#x27;til the last. Second, the head has a flange on it that surrounds the nozzle. This prevented me from being able to find the gaps between my teeth in some instances. Third, and most disappointing, is the fact that you cannot use the device on the inside of your teeth. It does work, but, you will likely be annoyed by having to reload the reservoir about three quarters of the way through your flossing regimen.</li>
    <li> I recently started caring about my dental health after part of my tooth fell out because it was undermined by a huge cavity. I can say with confidence that for the past decade or so, I wouldn&#x27;t brush more than three times a month, and that was on a good month, and I practically never flossed. After the incident with the tooth, I became concerned with my dental health and hygiene and started looking up what I could do to start fixing up my teeth. Everything pointed me towards Philips Sonicare as the brand to go to for dental health equipment. I first purchased a [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] to brush my teeth with after looking at numerous reviews for this and other alternatives online, and the next day I followed up with this Sonicare Airfloss to complete the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon getting it, the first thing you notice is the kind of odd shape and size of the tool, though it isn&#x27;t at all unwieldy or ugly. It&#x27;s sleek like all other Sonicare products and looks beautiful on my counter next to the DiamondClean. I got some [[ASIN:B005BUNTTS Crest Pro-Health Rinse Complte Fresh Mint 1 lt.]] mouthwash to use as the liquid agent for this utensil. Basically what the Airfloss does is when you turn it on and press the activate button, it will shoot out a very high pressure burst of air full of tiny micro-droplets of water or mouthwash, whichever you prefer to use (I used mouthwash) that literally blasts out all the food particulates and plaque and other gunk that gets stuck between your teeth and gums. I advise using a mouthwash instead of water for this because the mouthwash contains other ingredients to neutralize bacteria and destroy and prevent plaque regrowth and other sterilizing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the Airfloss the first time, first make sure that you put it on the charger and let it charge fully for 24 hours. This will condition the battery and make sure that it will last you its full lifespan and capacity, which is enough to last over two weeks if you use it twice a day. After charging it for the first time, you flip up the clear cap of the reservoir on the back of the unit and fill it up with about two tablespoons or teaspoons (I forget) of water, mouthwash, or other cleaning agent of choice. Then press the power button near the bottom of the unit so the little green LED light turns on, then point the nozzle away from you (or wherever, it doesn&#x27;t matter right now) and press the activate button a few times, which will prime the unit and bring the liquid you added to it into the system. I find that you shouldn&#x27;t press the activate button more than once per second because if you do it too fast, the motor will kind of backfire because it will try to suck in air and burst out the stuff before the previous burst has fully left the nozzle. So, the first few burst the first time you use the Airfloss will be just air but after that, it will shoot out very high pressure air and mouthwash or water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the real regular use, you try to hold the device so that the little outlet of the nozzle is perpendicular against the surface of your teeth and is resting in between your teeth, while the rubber face surrounding the nozzle outlet is gently resting against the surface of your teeth. Then press the activate button and *Puft!* you&#x27;re good to go. Repeat for all your teeth including your rear molars. It will take a few uses to perfect the form and style in which you use the Airfloss, so the first time, you might find that some of the burst sprays out and dirties up your mirror or wall, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it soon enough. Ideally, you should be able to eventually stick the nozzle in your mouth and know where to place it by muscle memory or feel and keep your lips closed around the neck of the nozzle so that nothing sprays out of your mouth, which can happen because the burst is so fast and high pressured that it can bounce off your tongue or your teeth ifyou don&#x27;t place it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this device to be a much better alternative to manual flossing with string because manually flossing doesn&#x27;t always remove all the gunk between your teeth whereas the Airfloss does, flossing with string can cut up your gums which allows more evil bacteria to penetrate deeper into your gums and can cause problems. Manual flossing can also result in small fibers of broken off floss string getting stuck between your teeth and making a mess, and finally, unless you use a very liberal amount of string floss, you&#x27;re just moving the bacteria and plaque from one tooth to the next because all the stuff that comes out from between your teeth gets stuck on the floss string, and then you take that same (now dirty) string and stick it between your next teeth. The Airfloss avoids all these problems and I feel that it blasts and cleans out between your teeth and gums more effectively than string floss would even if it didn&#x27;t have these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s talk about results. I&#x27;ve been using the Airfloss 2-3 times per day for just over a month in conjunction with my Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush and new, better brushing habits. I have no plaque at all on or between my teeth, and my gums feel refreshed and my teeth and mouth feel clean after using the Airfloss with the mouthwash I add to it. Since I started using these products a month ago, my teeth have whitened over 5 shades whiter, which is a night-and-day difference and I&#x27;ve actually received compliments and surprise when people see my new teeth and the way they sparkle now. I&#x27;ve even let some other family members use the Airfloss with spare nozzles and they all say that after using it, their mouth feels the cleanest it has ever felt. If oral hygiene and dental health are concerns of yours, and even if they aren&#x27;t, this is a great product that will definitely enhance and better your life.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! Makes my teeth/mouth feel amazing. I was a little skeptical after a Dentist poo poo&#x27;ed the idea of using one, but in conjunction with flossing the results are amazing. My last check up and cleaning proved it.</li>
    <li> So I was a bit skeptical heading into this purchase, but after 3 months and a dental checkup - I LOVE IT!    Sonicare puts out great products, but this one is awesome.  I can use Scope mouthrinse or Listerine - Listerine seems to work best as it doesn&#x27;t bubble up in the resivour.  The fact that I can use it with mouthrinse and put active ingredients where I need them in those hard to reach areas is huge.  I&#x27;ve found that I really don&#x27;t even floss any more, not that I did that much before, but now when I floss every other week there is no plaque to remove.  My daily use of AirFloss is helping my gums remain healthier and now after a checkup I didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;did you floss much between visits\\&quot; question.  I passed the exam and my hygienerst was proud, even after I told her about AirFloss...  PLUS, my kids LOVE the \\&quot;squirt-squirt\\&quot; machine...  Fun and healthy gums for all!</li>
    <li> Best thing since sliced bread.  Quick,easy and not messy.  Love it.  No more string floss for me:-) squeekyclean.  I also use the supersmile toothpaste/toothbrush/rinse and my dentist has noticed a difference;less tarter build up and reduced pocket numbers.  Just ordered another for my husband and will likely ship one to my mom,son and daughter in law for Christmas.  A bit pricy but our teeth are worth it and it should last years.</li>
    <li> The first time you jostle the airflosser, the handle will fall off the base and onto the floor.  Your flosser attachment will break.  I suggest you get a roll of electrical tape and wrap the attachment when you put it on the handle.  I am waiting for replacements.  Very poor design for the base charging unit.  But I like the way it works, so I will keep using the super glue and electrical tape on the flossing attachment.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s easier than traditional flossing and seems to get in between the spaces quite well. I still wonder it if gets everything and still use a traditional floss occasionally.</li>
    <li> This thing is GREAT.  In just seconds you can clean between your teeth and it really freshens your breath.  It works great with mouth wash.  I use it several times a day.</li>
    <li> This is the second Airfloss I&#x27;ve purchased. I have used mine daily since Oct 2011 and love it. I gave my brother the other one as a gift for Christmas. Have not gotten a review from him yet. When flossing with string floss, I always felt, Am I doing a complete and effective job?. I feel supper clean now. Now I only have to wait til Feb. to see what my Hygentist says. She and my Dentist were the ones who introducted and recommended the Airfloss.</li>
    <li> This Airflosser is perfect, especially for people who hate to floss or are too lazy to floss!  It&#x27;s easy and quick! It \\&quot;flosses\\&quot; the areas at the gumline between teeth.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that if your teeth are tightly spaced (like where regular floss needs a bit of pressure to get between teeth), it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;floss\\&quot; between the teeth, EXCEPT for at the gumline.  My husband was a once a week flosser, but now, he uses his Airfloss EVERY night before bed.  He loves it!</li>
    <li> I generally like Sonicare toothbrushes and recommend them as one of the options for those who wants to consider using an electric toothbrush. I don&#x27;t have an ax to grind with Philips nor do I own stocks in competing product company (Oral-B/Gillette). Not a paid spokesperson for either and don&#x27;t market any one particular brand in my office.  I have personally used and evaluated many oral hygiene products from major players in the industry for past twenty years, often before they were released to the general public. My closet is full of stuff that I have evaluated over the years and have discontinued using, if not discarded already.  My comments are based on personal evaluation of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is no substitute for flossing.  It is nowhere near effective as regular flossing using traditional dental floss, waxed or unwaxed, thin or thick, in removing food particles between teeth. My teeth are straight without any missing teeth and have no severe crowding or tight contacts between any teeth. Therefore, tight contacts and crowding was not an issue when I was evaluating this product.  The main problem is that the water/air pulse generated by this device is simply insufficient to completely and in some cases even partially dislodge the debris. I end up having to repeatedly blast the same area to no avail. Furthermore, I have to refill this device 6-7 times before I&#x27;m finished, which I find tedious and more time-consuming than traditional flossing.  I usually end up having to reach for a floss afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an adjunct device to supplement flossing, this device might be marginally useful for older patients with large gaps between their teeth. Even then, there are better options such as interdental/interproximal brushes and Waterpik devices.  For patient with braces, where food particles on the brackets are more of an issue than in-between areas, this device might be useful. However, Waterpik is still a better option here as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips brochure for efficacy of this product is overly optimistic, like a lot of marketing stuff in general. Save your money. This unit has been banished into my closet.hilips brochure for efficacy of this product is overly optimistic, like a lot of marketing stuff in general. Save your money. This unit has been banished into my closet.</li>
    <li> I have used Water Pik for the last 3 yrs and have had nothing but trouble with it, they replaced it once as the battery was not holding charge. Again 10 days past my warranty the replacement one did the same thing, they told me to do all this sort of cleaning, and I did, that worked for a few times back to battery not holding charge. So I went with Philips as I have there toothbrush and I am very very please so far.</li>
    <li> I regularly use a dental oral irrigator that attaches to the bathroom sink faucet. It works great and has saved me dental woes. I have been looking for a portable device that would do a good job when I can&#x27;t use my faucet irrigator. This device is it. It works great at cleaning and is portable. I enjoy using it and I am going to use it along with the faucet irrigator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/04/12 Update: Unit stopped working after about 60 days of use. I called Philips and they sent me a new unit in about 6 weeks. Stores had the unit on their shelves, so I called Philips after waiting for 3 weeks for the replacement unit and Phillips said that the Airfloss was on back order. That sounded like BS cause Costco and other stores had plenty of Airflossers on their shelves. So, I waited and the replacement finally arrived about 6 weeks after I called Philips. Replacement unit has worked great for the past 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/04/13 Update: Received replacement unit today. Took one month to get it, so Philips has improved replacement shipping speed. I find that 30 days is still way too slow. We&#x27;ll see how long this unit lasts. I like using the unit, so i have 2 of them and will hopefully have a back-up unit while waiting for the next replacement if the new one breaks. Does anyone care at Philips? If so, what are you doing to improve your quality and replacement shipping time? Maybe Philips will reply to this review?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/28/13 Update: Replacement unit stopped recharging, so I called Philips and they are sending me another replacement unit.&lt;br /&gt;02/14/13 Update: Received replacement unit today. We&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts. Replacement did arrive much faster this time, so Philips is improving service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;04/09/15 Update: Broke today, but lasted over 2 years.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  I tend to be one of those people that if all else fails, read the instructions.  I wish I had read them first.  The top colored part is an activate switch and it isn&#x27;t labeled at all.  So, if you turn on power, add water or mouthwash and start playing, you can accidentally get splashed where you don&#x27;t want to be, like your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would probably not be suitable for someone with sensitive gums.  I read what the velocity of the water/mouthwash and air was somewhere and it&#x27;s pretty high.  If you point it at places like under your tongue, it&#x27;s going to hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I recommend reading the directions, paying attention to priming the pump and would suggest using mouthwash for your first time.  It can taste pretty awful dislodging those decaying food particles.  I got a bit of blood the first time.  I do have deep pocket depth in the back teeth.  I got a major improvement in my teeth health using an electric toothbrush.  The periodontist did suggest a water pic, but this seemed nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With an electric toothbrush, pocket depth improved initially and now it&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t gotten worse or better.  I&#x27;m hoping for a better checkup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might end up being called a \\&quot;Battery Operated Hygienist\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this machine.  It is easy to use and pack and flexible.  My waterpik gets more debris out of my teeth and after about a dozen uses the top started blowing off of this one.  My dentist is skeptical about this device...he hasn&#x27;t read any research that gives it a thumbs up.  I just want it not to fall apart.  Not worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> Incredible write-up -- that was all hype! The concept is great, but the product does not deliver.  The Philips Sonicare Air Flosser seems like a product that one would purchase from an \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; commercial for $19.95 + get one free!  If you are even remotely interested in the product, ask your dentist for guidance BEFORE you purchase.  You can get some very good dentist-recommended products for the $75+ cost of the Air Flosser.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item without any preconceived notions about whether it worked well or not, and have been pleasantly surprised by its results. Thanks to congenitally-missing permanent teeth, I have a mouthful of expensive bridgework, which demands that I exercise extreme care with my oral hygiene. That means removing food particles from around and underneath bridges a few times a day, and I think the Airfloss is perfect for that task. Because of its lower volume of output, it does not replace a full-size water-pick device that you might keep near your bathroom sink. Nor does it fully replace ordinary flossing, which no doubt does a better job of removing biofilm around the base of each tooth. However, it works quite well for its intended purpose, which is blasting particles from between teeth (and from under bridgework). I highly recommend it to others with fixed dental appliances or other circumstances, which may make it necessary to floss several times a day.</li>
    <li> A satisfied owner of the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes, I thought this flosser device would be the perfect thing to help out with dental hygiene between cleanings, particularly as I now have several crowns. WRONG!! The literature on the product is particularly misleading. The device shoots one small spit of water at a time, you must wait between spits for the pump to recharge, and the spit is very, very weak. You would do more good by vigourously swishing water in your mouth all on your own. So in short, the device is weak, completely underpowered, poorly engineered (the water reservoir is tiny and the pump must be microscopic)and utterly ineffective. Note as well that because it is a personal product, once opened and used it often cannot be returned at local retailers. I think the good old WaterPik is a vastly superior product, choose that instead. As for Philips, the company should be ashamed of flogging such a terrible, and yet expensive, product. Because of this experience, I will not buy product from them again. I am so disappointed, and so angry that I was gulled by their very misleading advertising. I would, if it were possible, give this product negative stars!</li>
    <li> Shut down during the first use and will not even turn back on. This product is not going to work the way you would hope even if it doesn&#x27;t break.  You need abrasion to remove plaque. Just blowing water between your teeth it is in no way flossing.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare Airfloss does an alright job of getting food particles out from between your teeth. I have braces so everything gets stuck in my teeth. But while it does okay, I think that the steady stream of the Waterpik best suited my needs. I only tried the Philips Airfloss because I&#x27;ve gone through 2 Waterpiks in the last two years. Granted I DID use the cordless, handheld version. Perhaps the counter top version has a longer life span. That being said, whether you use the Sonicare Airfloss or the Waterpik, nothing beats traditional floss. I know it&#x27;s a pain, especially when you have braces, but traditional floss is the only real way of getting plaque along the gum line, between the teeth, in all those close, small spaces. Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> So I use this in the shower because it pushes a lot of water and you have to spit it out.  Once you get use to that it is great, because I am not a flosser.  I hate flossing so this is a good alternative for me.  Also note that they say you can but mouth wash in this, DON&#x27;T - it burns something fierce.</li>
    <li> This is my first review and I felt compelled to put my thoughts out into the Amazon ether because so many people seem to think this product doesn&#x27;t work and I want to try and right the ship as best I can for those who already own one as well as for those who are considering making the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;ve owned this product for 9 months and to me, it works.  I&#x27;ve been to the dentist once during this 9 month period and they noticed a distinct difference in the amount my gums bleed and believe me, they used to bleed.  Leading up to that appointment, I only used the Airfloss and I wasn&#x27;t even using it on a daily basis - maybe a few times a week (I have consistency issues, hence why I purchased this product to begin with - I hated flossing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crux of the issue with this product to many, in my opinion, is that people aren&#x27;t using it properly.  It seems most people expect to be able to fit the nozzle in between your teeth but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the intent of the product at all.  The purpose is to position the nozzle such that the jet of water is aimed directly at the bottom of the piece of gum that sits between your teeth so that the microfilm that builds up there can be washed away.  This doesn&#x27;t require the nozzle to be pushed in between your teeth or pushed hard into your gums - it just needs to be aimed at the right spot, that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it (and I believe it works great this way) is as follows: I rest the nozzle very lightly against my teeth, sometimes not even at all, and make sure it&#x27;s aimed at the bottom of the piece of gum that falls between my teeth.  If you aim it higher, the water&#x27;s just going to ricochet off your gums and splash your mirror.  Why? Because there&#x27;s no space there for the water to move through and clean anything.  The purpose is to allow the water to get around the gum and to do that, you must aim towards the bottom of the gum, where there&#x27;s space.  Again, no need to get the nozzle in betweenyour teeth or pressed very firmly up against your gum.  Give it a touch of space and once you press the button, the jolt should cause the nozzle to lightly tap your teeth and you should be good to go.  And don&#x27;t aim the Airfloss upwards - the water needs to be able to escape out the back, so keep it level.  Think of it as if you&#x27;re trying to hose down someone covered in mud - you wouldn&#x27;t walk right up to the person and slam the nozzle directly into their stomach and then pull the lever, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you need to practice a few times to get it right but once you get the process down, you can floss while walking around your house with no issues.  It&#x27;s much quicker than normal flossing in my opinion as well - I usually give each gap a couple presses and I&#x27;m still done in a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the product works as advertised and I continue to use this on a regular basis.  It just takes a little bit of tweaking/practice but I think it can work for everyone, regardless of mouth/gum size.</li>
    <li> This product has been now replaced once and now it is not working again.  it lasts only 3 months! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> It did the job but harsh on gums. It stopped working after 4 months. Now I have to contact the company for support!</li>
    <li> Not all I expected it to be.  One refill of water is not sufficient nor does it have enough power to clean as well as more mechanical means.  Back to floss for me.</li>
    <li> Spraying mold/mildew into your mouth is probably not good. After a few weeks of use, the fluid chamber becomes filled with mold.  Black mold.  I&#x27;ve tried toothpicks and cotton swabs to clean it out, but there are little cracks and holes that I cannot reach.  They are imbued with mold forever.  I&#x27;m not using this product anymore, it&#x27;s just impossible to clean properly.</li>
    <li> Use it after I eat to get out everything! Holds a charge, too! Just make sure if you use mouthwash that you pump water through to keep from getting buildup. I am still on initial flosser attachment.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this thing works with such little liquid per squirt but it very good at shooting out particles between your teeth. I recommend filling it with mouthwash.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dentist as the best flosser available.  It does a very good job especially for hard to reach places.  A very good product and worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Its already broken! the motor malfunctions; instead of one burst of air each time you press, it shoots 3 -4 in rapid succession; it conks out after flossing about 1/2 of your mouth.</li>
    <li> Good product except the nozzle broke at the base 2 times and the reservoir is too small for my use.  Bill P</li>
    <li> Battery died after 8 months of light to moderate use. It is nearly impossible to replace. Otherwise it worked well.</li>
    <li> just stopped working in about 12 months. I really liked the product as it did a great job flossing but I had to toss it in the trash after about 12 months. It just quit working. I suspect the electronics got wet and corroded to a point of no return. I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> If you care about your oral hygiene , this is well worth the money! I love it, and the travel kit :)</li>
    <li> I purchased a package in costco which included 2 Phillips sonicare and was delighted with the results.  Now neither will charge and both nozzles have cracks.  I held my finger over the cracks and continued to have good results. I can&#x27;t locate the literature and need help getting them to charge.  I also need to locate replacement nozzles.</li>
    <li> It lasted less than one year.</li>
    <li> Having ordered in Austria, I wasn´t ware I would need an adapter.&lt;br /&gt;The extra tips are too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to do a good job of cleaning between teeth. Don´t know if it really removes plaque.</li>
    <li> I used to floss irregularly. The Airfloss is so easy and fast that I don&#x27;t miss a night flossing! I recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their teeth.</li>
    <li> Great flossing alternative</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money on this. Just don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Weak pulses do nearly nothing and is slow as pulses activate only after a weak motor energizes a spring - slowly - and then the spring pushes a weak stream at your teeth.  Reservoir too small to a fraction of your teeth - but it does not really matter as the pulses are ineffective - and I love my regular water jet machine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I ordered it because I recently got braces put on and it works great not having to string around the wire on my braces. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it runs out of water quickly and I tend to dribble a little. But it works really well.</li>
    <li> I say tasty because I fill the reservoir with mouthwash!  This electric (rechargeable battery) flosser does a great job of pushing out particles stuck between my teeth at the gum line.  Faster and easier than manual flossing.  After a couple of months I notice my gums are healthier and less likely to bleed.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  My first one broke so I purchased a second one.  Philips replaced the first one, no problem.  Philips impressed me with their customer support.  This airflosser used in conjunction with the Philips Diamond Clean electric toothbrush makes your teeth feel the same as a professional teeth cleaning.  I love it!</li>
    <li> the wand does not fit the charger perfectly. The light comes on and then goes out. It does not work like the toothbrush. It fits the  charger just right.</li>
    <li> pretty effective, better than traditional floss. Im using it every day now. Will buy another one for my wife soon.</li>
    <li> Discovered when recommended by my dentist.  Great for flossing--easy and pleasant!  My teeth are now super-clean, with little effort.  Yay!</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for a friend &amp; had it shipped to her after loving mine that was purchased from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The only problem with this one is it quit working after 3 months and the Return Policy only allows for a 30 day window for a return. A $70-something product should definitely last more than 90 days. I can find no way to contact the seller directly. Sorry I didn&#x27;t just buy it from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond &amp; mail it to her myself as they would&#x27;ve exchanged it. Next time I&#x27;ll pay attention to return policy windows.</li>
    <li> Great Item, easy to use, better then regualr flossing. I would highly recommend this product for those who need to follow their dentist recommendations</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my original Sonicare which gave up after 18 months of daily use.  While i was disappointed that it quite working, I love the product and quickly replaced it.</li>
    <li> I find this unit quite clumsy to handle.  Perhaps it is arthritis I my hands but it is awkward.  The plus is that I think it does a good job of flossing.</li>
    <li> This product won&#x27;t get all of the food in between your teeth so you will still need your traditional floss.  The first time you use it, you will notice bleeding from your gums as it is pretty powerful.  I would recommend it, but don&#x27;t think this is the only thing you will need for a proper cleaning routine.</li>
    <li> my dentist recommended this product and it works well . I have a small mouth and tight fitting teeth that are not easy to clean .</li>
    <li> i was advised by my dentist to try this product.  i love it.  I use it twice a day and it leaves my mouth clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> great if you dont like to floss takes some getting used to though just keep your mouth closed when using</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the unit failed after just two months of operation, but worked (briefly) exceptionally well and is the best non-manual flossing device I have found to date.  The failure symptoms indicated that the barrier between the water storage and the pump motor failed resulting in &#x27;ugly&#x27; water in the on board storage and eventually failure of all electrical functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance was so good that I am going to assume that mine was a factory defect from a quality OEM and I am going to order a second unit with fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like regular flossing (I don&#x27;t think many people do), you should check out this product.  It is easy and quick to use.  Now I actually don&#x27;t mind daily flossing.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is not worth the money.  You have to refill the water reservoir a couple of times to get to all of your teeth.  I&#x27;m not sure that this really works as well as dental floss.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of floss even though my father is a dentist. Also no fun to use floss with crowded teeth. Airfloss got me flossing since it&#x27;s so quick and simple to use. My gum health has definitely improved. Probably not as efficient as a waterpik or real flossing but a great alternative if you wouldn&#x27;t normally bother to floss manually.</li>
    <li> After less than 6 months it has stopped working!  I loved it while it worked.  I need to call the company but am not too hopeful.</li>
    <li> This was my second one.  It lasted four months, then the water started squirting out from everywhere.  Amazon could not help and sent me to Philips.  Philips sent me a handle in October, but no top.  I am still waiting for a replacement from them.  I would not buy another one.  Philips do not support them.</li>
    <li> Just received the product and used it for the first time. It worked well and effectively removed food residuals between the teeth. However, there is NO travel case come with this model. I am quite disappointed by that...</li>
    <li> lousy  was not worth the price at all</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long before it broke.  I bought it because it was recommended by my dentist, but it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it works perfect. The product actual break down after half year , but called phillips customer service they send me a new one next day!! So yup, its a year since I bought this product, used it everyday and love it.</li>
    <li> It does the job it says, but my only complaint is the button location, you can accidently hit the button because of the way you have to hold it and then the lack of liquid it will hold....gotta fill it up each day!!! But the price was right...</li>
    <li> This is a really cool product.  I love that I can power jet air and mouthwash in between my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hygienist told me this product does not replace flossing but is a great compliment to flossing.  I now use this product in addition to flossing and my mouth feels great!</li>
    <li> I have used the Airfloss for a few weeks now.  To use the airfloss you position the small tip between your teeth and press the big button.  There is a half second whirr then it shots a high pressure burst of air/water between your teeth.  Repeat between all your teeth. I have found using a mirror the first few times helps. But be aware you will have little droplets of over spray on your mirror.  (A shower mirror is ideal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use. After the first few times you get to know where to position the tip and you can use it without the mirror, doing all your teeth in no time.  It is a lot easier (for me at least) to do than manual flossing.  As for working, it certainly does work, you can see the food debris when you spit out after using the Airfloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big question, is it better than flossing.  One on one a single round of using the air floss vs flossing manually,  I would have to say manual flossing is better.  The Airfloss doesn&#x27;t work as well if there if your teeth press tightly together.  One burst is not as good as running floss up and down both sides.  However, it is much easier to use the Airfloss regularly.  If you floss twice a day every day then I would not recommend switching.  If on the other hand you floss \\&quot;when you get to it\\&quot; like most Americans, switching to using the Airfloss daily (perhaps in addition to the \\&quot;when you get to it\\&quot; manual flossing) is a no brainier. Using the Airfloss is easy, and much better than not flossing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some final notes... The Airfloss charges with induction like a sonic care toothbrush.  This means if you have a sonic care pro charger (with the little eraser head size bump) you can use it to charge the Airfloss, and only have one charger to plug in.  Also you can use mouthwash to Airfloss, however be sure to run water though the unit after, to prevent sticky build up.  (The water itself in my area is hard, so I use distilled water in the Airfloss. A one dollar gallon of human drinkable distilled water will last a very long time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, highly recommended.ed water will last a very long time.)    In summary, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Technically, its better to use this than nothing at all.  But I would not recommend this over a floss pick.  It feels cool but my teeth and gums don&#x27;t feel that clean after.  I have always used a pick and my gums are always good when I go to the dentist.  All this does is blast air and water between your teeth.  I do not see how this will remove plaque that is stuck to your teeth unless you keep doing it over and over again.  I think of it like a pressure washer on a home. You could go burst water in one spot, but it won&#x27;t clean the hole mess.</li>
    <li> This makes flossing much faster and easier than using string.  It is pretty convenient to now floss every time I brush. I have found that the AirFloss actually cleans better than string floss (in contrast with another review that I read).  It really washes the gaps clean and makes everything feel very fresh. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a rather peculiar device. It is advertised as an effective water floss system but it fails in comparison to the real Waterpik. The reservoir holds a minute amount of water and the mini burst of air/water isn&#x27;t very effective. Save your money.</li>
    <li> What a total waist of money. Perhaps if you have perfect teeth with wide spacing between each tooth it might work for you but otherwise it does not do the job that a piece of dental floss does. Further more uou can&#x27;t clean from the back of your mouth with it as you can from conventional floss  also doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to complete a cleaning.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Both my wife and I have been long time users of Phillips Sonicare products so we felt confident in ordering the Airfloss device. We had hoped to use it as a substitute for our Waterpik especially while traveling. It was a complete failure. The nozzle does not fit securely into the handle and requires two hands to operate, one to hold the device and the other to try to keep the nozzle attached. If operated with one hand only the nozzle flies off as the pump is activated and pressure is applied. As this occurs whatever liquid one is using, either mouthwash or water, sprays the user around the neck. This neck spraying also occurs while using the two handed method unless a lot of pressure is applied throughout the flossing process.  I would return this product had I not already thrown out all the packaging. Fortunately for us our trash day is tomorrow and we will never have to see this product again nor feel the spray of mouthwash around our necks as we are struggling to keep the parts together. I strongly advise that you wait to purchase this product until a model beyond this Beta version is available. Having just read Walter Isaacson&#x27;s biography of Steve Jobs I was further impressed by what a poorly executed product this is and what kind of business would allow it to reflect so poorly upon them. Jobs would have described this product in terms that, while accurate, would likely be censored here.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes, but I think the title \\&quot;air floss\\&quot; title isn&#x27;t really very accurate. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it does anything. I think a water pick would be more effective. Ours kind of lives in our medicine cabinet now. Might be useful for someone with braces?</li>
    <li> Easy to use, making my teeth happy.  Water tank could be bigger.  My dentist is happy too.  Available at Target and Walmart as well.</li>
    <li> If you have groovy teeth (not in a good way), this little blaster can clear out food and plaque which are hard to reach with a brush and not flossable.  It does not work like the water flossing devices I have used in the past.  My old one would turn on and keep cranking out water until it was turned off.  This one is a single blast per click of the button.  It also has a slight delay after you click the button.  It seems to be cranking a pump and then releasing it.  That makes it kind of inconvenient for cleaning my whole mouth because I can&#x27;t just move it slowly along my teeth.  It is not really a floss replacement because tightly-wedged pices of food are not always removed and require real floss.  But the Airfloss does tend to clear out deeper areas which don&#x27;t respond well to floss alone.</li>
    <li> I have a waterpik that makes a bit of a mess when I use it and got this hoping for less of a mess. It does produce less of a mess, but is not nearly as effective as the waterpik. It will be okay for travel and in the evenings before bed--but just okay.</li>
    <li> The product stopped working after 2 weeks of use. The good thing is that customer service offered to replace it with a new one. The bottom line is that even though it may clean some of the food between the teeth, I still have to floss the old fashion way. The reason I gave it 3 stars is the customer service support the product comes with. Overall, I expected a lot from air floss, but I am a bit disappointed. I definitely did not expect this product to stop working after only 2 weeks. I hope the replacement will be better.</li>
    <li> teeth love nice easy flossing of this..</li>
    <li> I bought this product in June 2013 and by July 2014 it stopped working. After every splash, motor will stop and you will have to turn on power button again. It is really good product but with only one year life and 80 bucks I spent, I am sure I will neither buy this product again nor recommend anyone to waste their money. Really upset about this.</li>
    <li> Our son got braces just as the Airfloss went on the market. It looked like a perfect solution for a not-so-committed teen flosser. The early reviews I read said it worked well and worked fast. So, we bought it and it worked well for about three months. Sonicare has great customer service, and replaced it at no cost with free return packaging. The second worked for about four months and quit working. Both units simply stopped working. Sonicare again provided a second free replacement (third Airfloss). I unfortunately don&#x27;t think it will last any longer than the others. I will update this review if it lasts a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this third try is a fail, then I&#x27;ll ask for a refund from Sonicare (unlikely as it is that I&#x27;ll get it), or for another product in exchange for the Airfloss. Most Sonicare products very well (e.g. toothbrush) and for a very long time. This probably means very poor quality assurance for this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare customer service: 5-star&lt;br /&gt;Product reliability: 0-star</li>
    <li> Wonderful fit, for what I require in a product and I think this product is worth the price and when it comes to saving, Amazon is GREAT! ON A SCALE 1-10 the product rate as a 10, highly recommend, overall this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I got the wife a Philips toothbrush and the diamond brush heads and really liked them. She insisted that I buy more heads for it. While I was here I bought this flosser thing. It is incredible. I use it in the shower since I am too sloppy to use it anywhere else. I fill it with mouthwash and it is a delight! Get one.</li>
    <li> Who knew that flossing your teeth could be so much fun?  This airfloss injects water and air between your teeth and pushes out debris.  Easy to use and works well.  Let&#x27;s hope that my next dental check-up improves.</li>
    <li> I love this flosser!  It works well and when used with mouthwash, leaves my mouth feeling like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.  I have learned to keep my mouth closed around the flosser so that my bathroom mirror does not get splashed.  So, it does spray a little and backfire every now and then when you don&#x27;t have it lined up between your teeth properly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on March 4 and received it quickly from Amazon.  It looked cool and I was excited to try it, so I read the instructions, charged it, tried it out, and discovered that the product only had about 3 good \\&quot;pops\\&quot; in it before it shut down and it would not hold a charge (and by the way, the wind-up and subsequent pops of air are really loud and a little alarming).  I tried different chargers (we have sonicare toothbrushes), but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after 3 days of trying different things to get it to charge, I called Philips as directed by the literature included in the packaging.  We went through the standard \\&quot;are you too dumb to read instructions or does your product really not work\\&quot; questionnaires, and after satisfying them that my product was a lemon, I was apologized to, assured that I&#x27;d have my new product within a week, and all was well.  These things happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later, instead of receiving my airfloss, I began to receive \\&quot;backorder notifications\\&quot; from some third party shipping company.  I have received one every 10 days to 2 weeks since then with the shipping date moving ever forward in time, with the latest showing that the product will ship almost 8 weeks from the date when I first called.  I assume it would be delivered via TARDIS at some distant point in the future if I chose to wait for it.  Of course the Amazon return deadline had passed by now, so I had to deal with Philips again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called the number included with my backorder notifications, which turned out to be a shipping company who, after a lengthy hold time, was, of course, powerless to help.  They directed me to Philips, and when I called the number the shipping company provided, it turned out to be Philips Norelco who were... of course... powerless to help.  Philips Norelco transferred me to Sonicare who were... wait for it... powerless to help!  The product is so popular, it&#x27;s just not in stock, blah blah blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I would like to meet a Time Lord, since the product IS, in fact, in stock at stores throughout the country and at Amazon, I decided to ask for a refund instead, so I can purchase a new one on my own and have it in 2 days.  This Philips was happy to do, however it will take 6 to 10 weeks before I will receive my refund, and I have to return the product at my own expense, apparently.  I think that they expected me to be put off by the time frame on refunds, but frankly, I think my money is more likely to be \\&quot;in stock\\&quot; at the end of 6 to 10 weeks than this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now, I am so disgusted with Philips that I will happily take my refund whenever it comes and will order a Waterpik instead.  Who knows, by the time this business is concluded, dental nanobots may be available over the counter to clean off that pesky biofilm above the gum line and the whole issue will be moot.  Here&#x27;s hoping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to purchase this product, RETURN THROUGH AMAZON at the first sign of trouble.  Do NOT go through Philips.  Your gums will thank you.</li>
    <li> I use and love my Philips Sonicare, but this is a disappointment. I bought two of them, and hopped they would improve my gum heath. However, after my wife and I used them for a few weeks, we would NOT stop flossing. This only sends a mild short burst of water or mouthwash though the teeth at gum level. It does not do anything between the teeth except at the gum line, and to be honest, I am not sure it does nearly as good as flossing or using a manual gum stimulator. I expected more from Philips. I wound not recommend buying this at this time. It was an expensive purchases, and for us a wast of money.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and used it for four months, my gum bleeding is horrible and my gums have receded. Decided to stop using it as it just never got better. Day two now without it, and I hardly bleed with normal floss. Probably need another few days for the gums to heal.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. So quick and not messy like a water pic. Cleans between the teeth without struggling with floss. Recommend this product for anyone with gingivitis.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, bad teeth tend to run in my family. So after a few cavities and a root canal in 7th grade, I decided to start taking good care of my teeth. Since then I&#x27;ve been known to bring my tooth brush to work and brush after lunch, etc...  However, when it came to flossing my gums have tended to bleed, and some of my teeth are just too close together to make flossing something other than a real chore. I&#x27;ve tried the various plastic floss picks and thought they did worked well. However, during my last dental visit the dentist explained that despite my teeth looking very clean, there was no way to save my one back tooth due to the fact that the bone between the two teeth had deteriorated and could not keep the back tooth in place. This was the gap that I had to keep using the plastic floss picks on continuously, and it&#x27;s my suspicion that the floss pick had something to do with wearing down what little bone I had left between those two teeth which caused the last one to become unstable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week later, I purchased the Philips Sonicare AirFloss from Best Buy and started using it at home. I prefer to use it with water to get more pressure when I floss. In about a minute I was able to completely floss both top and bottom rows. It went so quick that I kept coming back and re-flossing again. Sometimes, it&#x27;s a little hard to judge the angle you should be aiming for to shoot the water through. However, I tend to do it again several times just because it went so fast and I want to be completely sure that I didn&#x27;t miss anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fully charged AirFloss is supposed to last up to 2 weeks. However, I keep it on the charger and plugged in whenever I&#x27;m not using it. I like the portability and look forward to taking it on trips and not have to worry about bringing a charger along.  It&#x27;s easy to use, quick and easy to clean. This made flossing extremely simple and chore-free. Thanks Philips for a great design.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this5 star was the fact that it does not have a replaceable battery. So that means after the battery dies on you a couple of years down the road, you have to throw the entire unit out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been good at flossing, hence I&#x27;ve tried all the gadgets. The Waterpick is too messy and I worry about bacterial build up in the reservoir. I hate the vibrations with the  Phillips Sonicare tooth brush so I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how effective the Airfloss is but at least I use  it. It has to be better than no daily care at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks so far, but Im pleased with it. It is true that it can be a bit messy at times. You need to either keep your lips tightly sealed while operating it or keep a bottle of Windex handy to wipe down the bathroom mirror afterwards. Also, a couple of teeth in particular that are really close together, it does actually hurt just a bit when I give it that blast of water.  I recommend using 1/2 water and 1/2 Listerine combo.</li>
    <li> I will know better how this product worked once revisiting my hygienist (she also informed me about it). I will be the first in her office to try it. It is a bit messy. Water is all over my mirror when done. Also, you have to fill up the water compartment twice to do front and back of teeth even though the instructions indicate you only need to fill it once. So far I would say it seems to work well, but again will not know for sure until i go back to dentist for my checkup.</li>
    <li> My dental insurance is not great. My dentist has diagnosed me with a hereditary form of periodontal disease. Teeth look great per care, but...gums are every decaying faster. DNA. :( This air pick was recommended by the dentist and I&#x27;m glad I spent the money. My wife was even impressed, as the entire flossing process is changed from string-to-an air pump of water or mouth wash. The replacement heads are cheap enough -- you won&#x27;t need many unless you over use it or jam it into your mouth too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun to use. It fires a mini hi-pressure shot of water or mouthwash (ala squirt gun type loading hole), enough for 1-2 mouthfuls -- and per your mouth&#x27;s natural reaction, you&#x27;ll find 90% of what you usually brush is taken care of with this... The mouth-end is places on the end edge of the tooth (braces/wearers ask your orthodontist before using), and does the job of traditional floss, in my opinion, better. Don&#x27;t \\&quot;bite\\&quot; on the head...shocking to hear how many folks abuse their stuff and then blame the manufacturer...yes, it was not intended to be used as an explosive... grr...do not use while bathing...note it runs on electricity...some guy in Jersey, &#x27;There was no warning on the box!&#x27;...c&#x27;mon, really? Does bleach really look like milk to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you have too many teeth and your mouth is comparable to Micheal Keaton&#x27;s in Beetlejuice...yes, don&#x27;t buy this. Have surgery first. Or use traditional floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who have access to a reasonably straight set of teeth will not only enjoy this device, but it will prolong their lives. Flossing has been linked to reducing the risks of cancer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used properly, you will use less toothpaste for the \\&quot;work\\&quot; of cleaning your teeth will have been done already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your dentist will then try to sell you Other products and services, noting the improved condition of your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some at Costco should read this. Y&#x27;know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to hate flossing. And I hate visits to the dentist that feel like I&#x27;m at the Cancer Center, hearing the word \\&quot;malignant\\&quot;. This device can combat both. If I had to choose one thing to take with me to leave my burning house safely, with my kids and spouse already safe, I&#x27;d grab this. Shelters have power plugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not sell or make these for a living. Thank you.isits to the dentist that feel like I&#x27;m at the Cancer Center, hearing the word \\&quot;malignant\\&quot;. This device can combat both.

    <li> The same story here. The first battery lasted for 10 month. Because I have 2 and 1/2 years warranty I called them and I received a replacement in about 4 days. This one lasted for 5 months. Now I have been waiting for a replacement for a week and the Company that handle the replacement says that they are on back order..... ????  My Braun tooth brush have been working for over three years with no problem. No more Philips products for me. They are using batteries that are do not last. I am happy with the product, but only if the batteries are improved. I feel that it work better than Water Pick.</li>
    <li> amazing product. highly recommended</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 6 months ago.  It is an OK way to remove food / debris from between braces, and it is much simpler than using traditional floss.  However, the water reservoir is not designed to be cleaned, and builds up moss / mildew inside.  if you don&#x27;t clean it out after each use, and leave it for a few days, the water you clean your mouth with will not be clean.  I&#x27;m not sure if this bacteria is bad for your gums and teeth... but it does not smell nice and is not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it does remove debris and food from your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several months, the unit stopped working.  I called Philips customer care and they are sending a replacement handle under warranty.  Customer service was very good and efficient!  However, they did not have any recommendations for cleaning the water reservoir.  I will be looking for a way to keep the reservoir clean so I can clean my teeth with clean (not mildewy!) water.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed as the thing died within a few months.  It started to blink like it needed to charge even after charging all night.  For a little while it even seemed possessed... wife and I were sleeping and all the sudden we heard this popping sound and turns out it was the airfloss going off all by itself, it was very weird.  A few days later it completely died and wouldn&#x27;t charge or power on at all.  And it&#x27;s too late to send it back to Amazon for a replacement so I guess I have to go the warantee route, oh so much fun.  I dunno, maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck with yours but you may just want to stick to good ol&#x27; fashioned floss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for several months and have finally quit using it.  I&#x27;m going to buy another product as an adjunct to my brushing and traditional flossing.  Other mention the burst of water/air hitting their tongue and this has frequently happened to me.  I&#x27;m not fond of the popping sound or the fact that it&#x27;s easy to have water sprayed near the sink (I&#x27;ve pretty managed to keep that at a minimum), but the burst of air and water hitting my tongue is just too much.  I&#x27;ve been decently satisfied with the job the Airfloss does, but I don&#x27;t like getting a sore on my tongue if it gets in the way.  I just think it&#x27;s too much to deal with and even with directions on how to keep the chamber clean and free of bacteria that&#x27;s still a big worry of mine.  So, my final decision is that I made an expensive mistake when I bought this.  Let the buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I bought this machine to go along with my daily flossing and thought it would be another good step in maintaining great oral health.  It is a pain to use though and my machine is defective (the on button will not stay on) and to quote my husband \\&quot;this thing is a piece of junk\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of this machine is a good one but it has not been perfected enough to be offered to the public for sale.  The TINY reservoir that holds either mouthwash or water is a joke and the dern thing leaked out onto the bathroom counter overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe a company like Sonicare can even offer this product...I think their toothbrushes are great...but they missed the boat on this flosser...I do NOT recommend and I am getting a refund as it is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the reviewers that like this product I am happy for you...I got a defective machine and because of that I am returning it and won&#x27;t get another because I think it is not worth the price or the hassle.</li>
    <li> While it is working, it is excellent.  However, it breaks quickly and permanently.  If Phillips could find a way to make the product long term viable, I would love to use it.  But since it will stop anywhere from 5 days to 5 weeks, it is a total waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This seemed like a good idea at the time....  but it is very ineffective.  I don&#x27;t feel like it makes a difference at all.  Better to use the Sonicare brush and old fashion floss.</li>
    <li> Purchased this, used for a number of weeks.  In summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you have teeth with little spacing between them, this may not get properly between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It will not replace flossing with respect to your gums (as per my dentist after using this solely between checkups)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The reservoir may grow mold.  It is small, and impossible to clean out.  I carefully empty it after every use, but when you wipe in the water reservoir (the few places you can reach) it shows that the surfaces were coated with mold after about six weeks, and I could not get all of it clean.  The manual provides no helpful tips regarding how to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Heads are hard to replace.  If you don&#x27;t like sharing a toothbrush with your partner, you will not like sharing this... and unlike the typical sonicare heads where you can replace them between users and use the same rechargeable head, this does not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Mold may grow inside the small passage of the head, and cannot be cleaned.  Need to replace the head, which is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using this product after six months of trying it.  At first, during the first 4-6 weeks, I thought it was the greatest replacement for flossing.</li>
    <li> I am one that doesn&#x27;t floss like you should and get it reminded to me with each dentist appt. The dentist suggested the air floss. It was working fine and I noticed less tartar buildup too. However, within 3 months it no longer worked. I have spare heads to use with no flosser to put them on.  A disappointment for sure. I won&#x27;t buy another since it seems others have had the same result, does not last.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> The airflosser is easy the handle after I figured how to place it between my.  At frist I made a mess on the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I want to buy a flosser for my wife but don&#x27;t need the charger.  Please give me a call.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for just over six months and its great. I do not have great teeth I&#x27;m cavity and plaque prone and haven&#x27;t gotten a truly positive review from a dental hygienist in my adult life. Part of that is almost certainly my fault I brush well, but can&#x27;t bring myself to floss regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blame large hands, a small mouth, sensitive gums, pretty much whatever I can to get the hygienist to stop berating me for my gums that bleed when you he or she pokes them with a metal hook..but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product after reading a study on PubMed (scientific publication site) that saw evidence that oral irrigation was nearly as good as flossing for gum health. I didn&#x27;t want a large oral irrigator sitting on the bathroom sink and this seemed to fit. Not only does it lack the giant water tank that many water flossers have, but its beautiful. If apple got into the business of sonic flossers this is what they would make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It uses the same base as my sonicare toothbrush which is great because I can limit cords around the sink.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quick I can get through my entire mouth in under a minute (compared to 3+ uncomfortable minutes of flossing)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s painless (never had any bleeding gums or really any discomfort)&lt;br /&gt;Its easy (although you I did occasionally experience a misfire, with the tank size enough for two trips around my mouth, theres always enough mouthwash or water to take another shot)&lt;br /&gt;AND THE HYGENIEST DIDN&#x27;T EVEN ASK, SHE TOLD ME I MUST BE FLOSSING. Her surprise was worth the purchase price hands down. She just told me to keep doing what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you hate flossing, but want to take better care of yourself this might just be for you.</li>
    <li> broke after a few weeks..$90,00 gone</li>
    <li> It is a good product, but Amazon leaves you to deal with the manufacturer if you have a problem with the item after 28 days. Tried their customer service and Gilberto P., a supervisor from Amazon, was rude and said to me that Amazon&#x27;s exchange policy for this item had expired and I had no options. My handle stop working after 6 months (the product warranty is for 2 years) and I had to get a new handle from Philips (great customer service BTW). My advice is to buy from Philips.com or another vendor and not Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the hopes that it would be a good replacement for flossing.  At my most recent visit to the dentists office, my dental hygienist recommended this to me.  After the first use I found it hard to believe it could do as good a job as regular floss.  It is supposed to work by shooting a blast of water and air between your teeth and thus removing food and plaque buildup between your teeth.  It does the first only, and not completely at that. It just doesn&#x27;t get nearly as much out as regular old floss.  I decided to stick with it for two weeks and give it a shot. After going back to using floss, my gums bled as if I hadn&#x27;t flossed, in well, two weeks.  Overall I would not recommend this as a floss replacement. I could see maybe using this right after you eat to remove food, but for that matter a toothpick would be a much simpler, equally effective and cheaper way to accomplish this.</li>
    <li> I am delighted by the lightness of this useful gadget, so different from the others I had.  My other two units required large reservoirs of water, but this one needs only a few ounces.  It is different from a traditional waterpik: this unit flosses teeth by applying pressurized water.  It took a little while to get used to it after having used a waterpik.  It feels refreshing to floss teeth with my new Sonic unit.</li>
    <li> If you have a family member who won&#x27;t use any traditional string floss methods, this might be just what you need.  My daughter found that her first use of the Philips Sonicare Airfloss caused quite a bit of gum bleeding.  Subsequent uses have cause less bleeding which leads me to think it&#x27;s doing some good.  But if she uses regular floss after the Airfloss, there is still some gunk left behind so I do not think it is as effective as one would hope.  Still it&#x27;s better than not flossing at all.  It is also messy.  If you leave your mouth open it sprays all over the place.  If you try to keep you mouth closed, it drools down your chin.  The battery life has not been an issue since we keep it stored in the charger.  We find it holds enough water for maybe 1.5 uses not two as stated though maybe practice will result in the 60 second cleaning they claim. I can see where this product would work in some situations where floss does not-if you had braces or were caring for another person&#x27;s teeth.  It would be a 5 star product for those applications.  You may get good results out of the Airfloss but I&#x27;ll stick with my little plastic floss picks I can use driving down the freeway...</li>
    <li> This device is NOT designed to replace flossing.  If you thought that was its purpose, you misunderstood. Sonicare might be partially responsible due to the choice of name. A very large segment of the population...well over half...simply refuses to floss.  I had my teeth cleaned last week, shortly after I received the AirFloss, and my hygienist put that number at 75-80%.  This device is targeted at the non-flossers based on the premise that brushing and using this gadget is better than brushing alone.  While I obviously haven&#x27;t conducted my own study, I believe that claim is true.    I floss twice a day and I purchased this as more of an alternative to the bulky WaterPik taking up bathroom counter space.  I can definitely say that using this after I floss and brush leaves my mouth noticeably fresher than simply flossing and brushing.    Now, to the gadget itself.  It is well made and coordinates perfectly with the Sonicare FlexCare toothbrush.  It also uses the same charging base, which is a nice convenience.  It will NOT charge in the new Sonicare DiamondClean charging \\&quot;glass\\&quot; which I thought a bit odd.  Even if you are used to a WaterPik, there is a learning curve with this device.  I spent several days wiping off the mirror and me before I got the hang of it.  The reservoir holds just enough fluid for one lap around your mouth if you do it properly.  It&#x27;s an odd sensation at first because you are essentially pulling a trigger (by pressing the top button) to project a short burst of air and fluid.  I might not be completely accustomed to it as sometimes it seems I must sometimes reposition my finger on the \\&quot;trigger\\&quot; to get it to activate.    After having used it for 2 weeks I can say I really like it.  Again, it is not a replacement for flossing.  It also, however, is not a replacement for a WaterPik.  I don&#x27;t think this would be very effective at removing that annoying bit of popcorn husk that gets stuck in the back of your mouth, for example.    So it is actually kind of a \\&quot;tweener\\&quot; device...somewhere between flossing and a using a WaterPik.  It&#x27;s not as effective as floss at flossing or a WaterPik at thoroughly irrigating your gums, but probably more convenient than either and much better than doing nothing more than brushing.  So instead of replacing anything, I have an extra gadget on the counter.  In my profession I have close contact with people at times and a clean, fresh mouth is important.  I&#x27;ll probably buy a second one to keep at my office.    BTW, if you register the device with Sonicare the warranty is extended an extra six months.</li>
    <li> The Airfloss charges using inductive charging, which mean it doesn&#x27;t have any direct contact between the charger and the unit, pretty cool.  I can rinse the unit under the faucet without worrying of wetting the battery terminals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One full charge and you can bring it with you when you travel as the charge will be good for two weeks.  Just be careful as the neck of the Airfloss can break if you just toss it in the bag.  For the price of the unit, I think they should throw in a hard shell case to protect it.  The unit turns off automatically after a certain time if you forget to turn off the power button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my experience with it, it does not completely remove everything particularly with food that usually gets in between the teeth like steaks and other meats. If you have perfect teeth with even gaps, I think this may work great.  For me, I have some really small gaps that I have to finish them up with regular floss.  But it really encourages you to floss as it is very convenient and fun to use.  No more nasty floss strings laying on your sink lest somebody forgot to put them in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have bridges, I think this is where it has a big advantage over strings.  And this is even better if you have braces, although you might need to refill it 3 times to clean the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use Listerine (you can also use water or other mouthwashes) as it gives me confidence with the added benefit of the antiseptics and also because it feels fresh in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I still believe you have to floss with a manual one but this assists with that giving you a cleaner mouth. It is so easy to use! Pour water into the reservoir and press the button on the top/back handle. It shoots a small burst of air and water between teeth and you can really FEEL that force between ur gumline. You can use mouthwash to disinfect the airfloss and at the same time, its flossing ur mouth! Be sure to rinse afterward by adding water into the reservoir and then expelling that using the button so that no sticky residue gets stuck in the machine.</li>
    <li> My wife plugged the unit in yesterday to charge up the Philips Sonicare Airfloss. We liked that you only put a tiny thimble of water in the compartment and you&#x27;re read to go. Place the wand between each tooth gap and press the button. You&#x27;ll be blasted mostly with air and a tinge of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is far more convenient than flossing but I am faced with a question I cannot answer: How can I measure the efficacy of this process compared to conventional flossing? My guess is that conventional flossing more aggressively removes plaque but that&#x27;s just a guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update if the efficacy question becomes more clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted my dentist for his professional opinion of the Sonicare and he said it&#x27;s new technology; he&#x27;s still waiting for a sample model to try and he seems excited about the product (he seemed jealous that I had the model before he did) so that is promising.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Airfloss is amazing!  My son recently got braces and lets just say getting an 11 year old to floss &#x3D; no fun. He loves the Airfloss - he does it every night no complaints.  It also gets the food around the braces - his teeth look like they were just cleaned.  I love it too - I still floss about every other day, but when I only use the Airfloss my teeth look/feel great.  I highly recommend this product to anyone, but especially if you have a kid with braces.</li>
    <li> I will preface this by saying that I am not sure how well the Airfloss works. I have used this for a week and it is easier than flossing. However, I am not sure how well it cleans. My teeth feel clean after using the Airfloss, but I do not see too much \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; from the water after use. I am comparing it to using dental floss where the remnants can be seen after cleaning. It is not so clear with the Airfloss. My wife and I use the Airfloss every night before bed and enjoy the quick burst of air and water. It is so good that my 9 month old will let us shoot a couple of air bursts on her teeth. It makes flossing easier and it doesn&#x27;t seem like a chore to floss. I have never been a good flosser but I use the Airfloss every night. This is a good item for its intended purpose.</li>
    <li> This little gadget does indeed provide a good way to provide that extra cleaning around gums, bridge work, etc.  It blasts away hidden particles like nobody&#x27;s business.    But...    How would YOU feel about paying $90 for a product you&#x27;d just end up throwing away in 2 or 3 years?  Yep, that&#x27;s right, if something goes wrong and/or the battery goes out you can&#x27;t just get it fixed.  It&#x27;s toast.  The 2-year warranty is fine, but wow.    Also, how is this worth more than your basic standard WaterPik?  OK, so it&#x27;s much more compact and would travel well, but I can&#x27;t think of another advantange.  It seems too fragile to last much longer than 2 years anyway.    Also, although it DOES blast away the particles, this too is a mixed blessing.  Better hold your head low over the sink or the whole bathroom could get soaked and there&#x27;ll be little bits of used food on your walls...</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sonicare Airfloss, along with a new Sonicare toothbrush for about two weeks now.  The combination seems to be working great.  I had gotten a bit lazy with flossing, and I started to notice some significant gum problems.  Using the two Sonicare products has already caused noticeable improvement.  I really don&#x27;t know if the Sonicare brush and regular flossing would have done the same thing, but I will say that this is a lot more pleasant, and, because it is almost fun, I tend to floss at least once every day.    HOWEVER, with that said, look around for a better price than Amazon.com.  I am a person that buys from Amazon without checking other sources because I feel that Amazon&#x27;s price is generally pretty competitive.  Not so with the Sonicare products.  Both of these products are available on-line with a 20% discount (shipping included), a total savings of around $46!!     This has been a very good lesson for me.  I won&#x27;t be buying anything from Amazon without checking several other sources first.    The products are fine.  The prices really stunk!!    Update 9/14/11: I am returning the Airfloss to Amazon today.  The Airfloss stops working for long periods, even when fully charged, and makes crunching sounds like gears stripping.  I bought a replacement, but it is already making the gear stripping sound.  I think the Airfloss is a great idea, but I think Sonicare has to work on the improving the internal mechanism of the device.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Who likes to floss?  the Airfloss makes it easy, no more \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; to fined no more broken broken floss string, or fighting to get way back there.  Great checkup at the dentist!</li>
    <li> Basically this gizmo spits out a very small, narrow jet of water (or mouthwash) between your teeth for a fraction of a second, and it is advertised to be a replacement for dental floss.  It&#x27;s hard to say how well it does what it purports to do, but it&#x27;s better than nothing, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t do any harm.  Before you give Sonicare your hundred-dollar bill, you might ask your dentist for a professional opinion of this product&#x27;s efficacity.</li>
    <li> Fast and comfortable enough to become a daily habit, unlike the dreaded floss torture. Which is more than enough reason to buy it. Would probably also be good for putting out real tiny fires.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to floss. The string breaks or gets caught in my teeth. This is a great tool. I appear to get all the benefits of flossing with the aggravation. I now floss regularly.</li>
    <li> Works like it was advertised.  Am  completely satisfied.  I would recommend this item for anyone that requires tartar control.  Good luck.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping that it would help with cleaning between two of my capped teeth that the dental hygienist said needed extra attention and maybe even daily use of one of those brush on a wire things. Regular floss doesn&#x27;t really remove food particles....it just moves them around. I was not pleased to be told to start poking that brush around in the back of my mouth. Not only does the Airfloss take care of cleaning between the teeth, it is a pleasure to use and leaves your mouth feeling great.  I use a mouth rinse in it instead of plain water.  I still use regular floss once a day and use the Airfloss once or twice as well.  As I said, for me the Airfloss and regular floss do two different jobs. I REALLY like this product!</li>
    <li> Starting with the positives, after trial and error learning how to use it, the product itself seems to do the job. As others have mentioned, if you have close teeth it may not work for you. In my case, I have found that certain back teeth are close together. Once you use the product you can get a feel for if the burst of water/air has passed all the way through your teeth or not. I find that on my harder to reach areas or tighter teeth that several bursts do the job. Only time will tell if the product truly replaces floss or not, that will be for my dentist to decide next visit. Now for the two negatives. The first area of concern is the \\&quot;trap door\\&quot; that holds your fluid needs to be re-engineered. I frequently find that it does not hold and the fluid leaks out. Also, on the same topic, the way it fills could be better. There is no doubt that if you use mouth wash when filling the chamber you will always loose some down the sink, and always have the wash the unit off when done filling it. Moving on, the real reason for only 3 stars is my first unit broke only after a week of usage. The battery light flashes rapidly yellow as if the battery is dead. Placing the unit on the charger does not resolve the problem. Fortunately I have a Philips SonicCare brush that uses the exact same charging base. This allowed me to verify that the charger itself was working, and that the air-floss unit itself failed. A+ for Amazons return/exchange policy. If the 2nd unit fails I will come back and update this review. When it works, it&#x27;s a great product. Perhaps if Phillips makes some small changes on a 2nd generation model if could be perfect.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0002AHY7A WaterPik FLA-220 Power Flosser, Battery Powered (Colors May Vary)]]Outstanding, rate a 10. Almost as effective as my dentist. Highly recomment for all ages, especially or us older folks.</li>
    <li> Very useful device, battery life is great.&lt;br /&gt;Compared with the stationary flosser - this one is much more convenient .</li>
    <li> Joy turned to disgust when I found black mold in the reservoir.  Now the instructions suggest that \\&quot;antibacterial\\&quot; mouthwash be used in the unit and emptied with all remaining fluid ejected before next use.  No time saver, especially since I also agree that regular flossing needs to be continued; I used the air floss twice a day but...&lt;br /&gt;I am really suprised at Sonicare as a leader in oral hygiene...but I am throwing mine away.  ugh</li>
    <li> Really like it as it can get to stuff that flossing doesn&#x27;t.  I admit, that I don&#x27;t floss as needed so the Airfloss definitely helps.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this wholeheartedly, so I ran out to get one. She said at first she didnt think it could work, then a rep came in and did a demo and she was impressed. She has always been very fanatical about teeth cleaning innovation and I was really excited to use it right away. But I was disappointed to learn it needed to charge for 24 hours prior to the first use. Bummer! Oh well, after cooling my jets for a day, I eagerly gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was not impressed. The little puffs of air and water seemed too short and light to be effective. But I proceeded to give my teeth a once over, thinking the entire time what a waste of money this was. And so surprising, considering 1) I love my sonicare toothbrush with a passion, and 2) my dental hygienist is always right on about what works and what doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I&#x27;d test out how well it cleaned by flossing after to check for residue on he floss. I usually have a bit of stuff to show on the floss every day, no matter how well I brush, and in this case I had not flossed in about 5 days which means there would likely be a lot of residue. figured I&#x27;d see a lesser amount than usual after using the air floss, but I didn&#x27;t have high expectations that this product might replace flossing. (BTW I really hate flossing because the floss always cuts into my fingers, and sometimes even breaks my nails, which are exceedingly soft).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using AirFloss, then using regular floss to test the effectiveness, I was SHOCKED to find that my floss was completely and utterly clean. Not even the least bit of residue was left behind. I flossed a second time, and really dug around to see if I could get anything out of my teeth, and not only was there no residue, there was no traces of odor--which I usually have on my floss. (Ewwww but true).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still slightly skeptical, given that the poof of air seems SO weak, but I saw first hand that my teeth were impeccable, and that kind ofsays it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now granted, I did go over my teeth at least twice on this first use, so it will be interesting to do my \\&quot;floss test\\&quot; after just one use, which is hopefully all that&#x27;s needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 12 year old son tried it too, and seemed to like it. He certainly had fun poofing air spray into his face, onto the mirror, and at the cat. For the record, this product is not cat friendly (ha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, at first blush this was a bust. Then after trying it once, i have to say I think it is superb. But just to be sure, I&#x27;ll try it for a few days or weeks, and report back if anything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note to Phillips development team, you might want to study what Apple does about out of box product usability and customer experience. Not cool to make me wait 24 hours from time of purchase to first use. Also, documentation is weak. Needs more info such as whether to leave it on the charger between uses, or is it better to charge once and use till battery drains? Also, the capacity of the water reservoir is way way way to small. I had to refill it four times in two uses. It should not have been designed to empty that quickly).</li>
    <li> It may be a hereditary issue, rather than a hygienic issue, but my gums are prone to gingivitis. I have to be cleaner with my brushing than others and I have to use mouth wash often. That is already bad enough, but then I had braces. And no, I am not a teenager. I am a full grown male that just happens to have a slight jaw deformity which will require me to get surgery after a year and a half of wearing braces. My surgery will be done at University of California San Francisco which has world-class surgeons. My orthodontist is a referral from there and is not covered under my insurance because UCSF only wants to deal with the best, unfortunately for my wallet. Keeping your mouth clean with braces is almost impossible and with my gum condition, it was just so much more trouble. After about 3 months with braces, my dentist told me that my normal brushing and cleaning wasn&#x27;t cutting it. My gums were bleeding a lot and the worse the condition of my gums, the higher risk of my surgery being sabotaged by poor gum condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I bought the Air Floss. It&#x27;s a bit unfair to say I bought the Air Floss because I was lazy, but flossing with braces is extremely difficult. However, I do use the Air Floss two to three times a day and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I have had my braces for over a year now and my orthodontist and dentist both agree my gums and teeth are in phenomenal condition... and it is even more impressive for someone with braces and generally bad gums to begin with. My gums are in extremely good shape and my teeth look much cleaner. No more bleeding thanks to the Air Floss. However, I still have to worry about the outcome of the surgery, but I know my teeth and gums are in the best possible shape going in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the Air Floss can do so much for someone with bad gums and braces, I would think this would also do extremely well for something without these problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a week, and although it actually does do a good job at cleaning the gumline, it&#x27;s not markedly better than floss, and it is possible to injure yourself with it, just as with the old-tech \\&quot;water pick.\\&quot; I have a tooth that tends to catch food bits and had hoped that this would help, but what it ended up doing was blast the food under the gumline, then I would have to blast it again two or three times to clean it out, which ended up causing bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final opinion: If you have healthy gums and want to keep them that way, and spending the money isnt a problem for you, go for it.</li>
    <li> I am the flosser of the house, but my husband saw this at Costco and HAD to have it. It came with 2 so I caved. Maybe I&#x27;m just old school, but I don&#x27;t think this devise does anything better than standard fingers and floss. In fact, I would actually say that the old way is better as it flosses between the teeth from gums all the way down, whereas, this simply BLASTS a spout of water (I use Scope instead of water) between your teeth at the gums and never touches between the teeth. Like one of the reviewers before me, I find I spend more time cleaning the spray off my bathroom mirror than I spend thanking Philips for such a super awesome flosser. Personally, I say keep your money...</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made.  The first one didn&#x27;t work right out of the box, the second one quit within a month and the last one came apart the full length of the neck.  I think I&#x27;m through with Phillips products.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t worth the $$$</li>
    <li> Great product!! Works fast, very effective, especially with mouthwash loaded into the Airfloss container. I&#x27;m not a big fan of manual flossing, but I understand how important daily flossing is to your health. In my opinion, this is a viable substitute.</li>
    <li> Kind of weak. It literally sprays water and a bit of air in between in your teeth. Kinda pointless. I love my Sonicare Diamond Clean Toothbrush and I bought this in respect of thinking it will live up to it. NOPE. Don&#x27;t waste your money buy a real floss that gives you real results.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to work with - must focus on one tooth at a time and air puff is not very strong - I returned the product and will reorder sonicare but not the air floss.</li>
    <li> Right out of the box this poorly designed lacking function over form does not work. All it does is puff out air, recharges for 4-5 seconds and repeats itself. And yes, I followed the instructions and filled the reservoir prior to use. NO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this product.  It will be great for travel and I love that it uses so little water.&lt;br /&gt;.  It makes flossing fun!</li>
    <li> This is a very powerful flosser.  I only use it 3 times, per week (with manual flossing the other days) because of its strength. However, when I do use it, it is efficient and effective. It nicely compliments my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Sadly, I can&#x27;t say that this completely replaces the disgusting task of flossing, but the air pressured Airfloss is a great way to complement the normal mouthcare routine. I use it with mouth wash and it quickly freshens up the mouth. Use it before brushing your teeth for a thorough cleanse. I wish it was strong enough to break into the gumline, but I suppose there&#x27;s no way avoiding the traditional tool of floss and your index fingers.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with regular flossing. Using mouthwash in this devise gives a unique and clean feeling that just rinsing with mouthwash cannot provide.</li>
    <li> Phillips...Worst customer service ever. I have owned a sonicare tooth brush for 4 years without a single problem. I bought one of these 6 months ago, It lasted 1 week then stopped working. After sitting on the phone for almost an hour. I was given the information to return it for replacement. It has now been 6 months and I still have no replacement. I get nothing but empty lip service if I happen to be lucky enough to get someone on the phone. I would give this product and company negative stars if is could. Do yourself a favor and buy a Waterpik....I went back to mine (It&#x27;s 4 years old)</li>
    <li> Thumbs down, big time!  Last night my Sonicare flosser \\&quot;died\\&quot;.  This is the second time within 18 months.  Sent the first back to Sonicare with a request the product be repaired.  Never heard a single word back from the company.  Now that my second flosser has conked out, I know now, in no uncertain terms, this is defective product not worth the money.  Flosser not engineered to last.  Buying a Flosser a year at approximately $80, is a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> After spending some time using this device I&#x27;m convinced a lot of the negative reviews on this product are due to user error.  That&#x27;s unfortunate as this is a very effective tool.  This device picks up where flossing leaves off.  I think you still need to floss a few times a week.  But floss does not really have the ability to dislodge debris in gingival pockets like this device can.  Use both.  The AirFloss every day, and the string floss a few times a week.  I am surprised by all of the reports of device failure after a short period.  I&#x27;m glad it has a 2 year warranty.  If it lasts two years, I will certainly have got my money&#x27;s worth out of it.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Have used Sonicare toothbrushes for more than 15 years.  Have gone through at lease 10 units.  The biggest problem with the past brushes was the rubber protection cover over on and off button. It eventually tears and once that happens its a matter of time until it goes belly up.  Other than  that we liked them very much.  The last two brushes that we got did not screw on the brush.. It is just a push in or press fit. These are the biggest piece of crap I have ever wasted my money on.  The brush vibrates horribly and falls out while using.  My wife has to hold the brush in to complete brushing. They are of such poor quality the must have them made in China now.  I called the company with my concern.  They said they would have the local rep contact me.. After two weeks I found out who the rep was and called her.  Got no where. They pretty much blew me off and said that was the way they are now.. REALLY???  To bad, used to have a pretty good product.</li>
    <li> I needed to start flossing, but I hated the time it took, so I was very pleased with this device. My first one actually died for some reason after about eight months, so I contacted the company and they sent me a brand new one in two days free of charge! They also asked me to send back the old one in the packaging of the new one and they paid to have it sent back! Can&#x27;t complain one bit!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend who specifically requested this as a gift...nonetheless he was very happy with the product as he always had problems flossing especially in areas with a wider gap.</li>
    <li> I totally love this little gadget, but in the 10 months that I have had it, i&#x27;ve had to have it replaced now THREE times! This thing was not cheap, and although it does the job, it&#x27;s really frustrating that I am constantly on egg shells about whether or not it is going to stop working.  This is ridiculous.  On top of that, they put you through the interrogation wringer to get it replaced.  I gave it three stars because it is great when it&#x27;s working....but it just doesn&#x27;t always work.  Furstrating.</li>
    <li> Easy enough to do the front and back of the teeth/gum.&lt;br /&gt;Once I do the teeth intersection I do the gums { about quarter inch }&lt;br /&gt;so as to toughen up the gums.&lt;br /&gt;Strong and enough water held in tank to do good cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is new on the market and my first one stopped working after 3 weeks.  Sonicare was very good about replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, use mouthwash in it instead of water and it gets deep pockets easily.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me I needed to start flossing twice a day as I was on the verge of periodontal disease. I tried flossing inside the office bathroom but it was quite embarrassing when people kept coming in an out. I finally decided to buy this one after many good reviews, and it worked perfectly the way I wanted it to. A quick yet effective way to clean my teeth in the middle of the day without much hassle -- a few times I was shocked at how much food the burst of air and water pushed out from between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left out one start as I think the reservoir is too small.</li>
    <li> If you hate flossing but know you should be then this is the item for you. I love this product. Since I received I have used twice a day and really notice a difference. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I love my Sonicare toothbrush so much.  It takes some getting used to - feels very different from regular flossing.  However, after using it only a couple times, I realize how easy it is to use (which encourages me to floss daily) and that it would be effective.  The Sonicare website says it is a game-changer in the floss industry, and I agree.  This may be the future of flossing --</li>
    <li> A total and complete rip off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of air pressure wouldn&#x27;t blow a fly off your arm so save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited to long and lost the money</li>
    <li> I purchased the air floss along with the sonicare toothbrush. unlike the toothbrush, which works great, this air floss could never actually clean my gum. all it makes is tiny &#x27;pooos&#x27; noise and then nothing.  DONT BUY THIS and get yourself a waterpik instead. ohh, did i forget to mention the unit failed to work after 1 month? yes.. it WOULD NOT CHARGED , NEITHER the waterpik flosser i purchased later.. but that is another story... so anyone would like to floss you teeth.. get a AC Waterpik unit.. that is the only one ever worked...</li>
    <li> This sounded cool and I love other products from Sonicare, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First.. the actual flossing, this thing comes nowhere near a replacement for flossing between your teeth with actual floss. Many of my teeth fit tightly together and if the water/air pressure can&#x27;t make its way in between the teeth it comes slashing out the front.  My bathroom mirror looked like a war zone.  Then, even using it between teeth where there is a gap large enough to accommodate the airflow, actual flossing after the Sonicare air flossing removed some food particles and plaque that the air flosser didn&#x27;t manage to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second.. it&#x27;s noisy and sounds like some sort of toy gun going off repeatedly. If you have a spouse/partner who sleeps near your morning bathroom routine, this thing is NOT QUIET!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading about it a little more it doesn&#x27;t look like the Phillips company has any substantial evidence to offer that this product can serve as a replacement for flossing in your regular dental care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you still have to floss to remove particles between your teeth that this noisy device can&#x27;t touch, what&#x27;s the point??</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the portable Water Pik for a while now, and was keen to see if there was an improvement and ordered the Airfloss. I was disappointed !! The Water Pik does a much better job, of cleaning out, than AF, specially if you have many cavities which needs a good amount water under pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about AF is that is provides higher pressure in short bursts, but then just one at a time, rather than continuous as in  case of WP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And at least for me, the WP does replace actual flossing.</li>
    <li> I have really liked using the Philips Sonicare air flosser. I usually just put in a shot of Listerine and away it goes. The clean might not be exactly what you get from a thorough floss the old way or using interproximal brushes but its quick and easy and does a pretty good job. I find i use it every time before brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad news. mine has just reached 2 years and it has died. The motor started having trouble occasionally a few months back and now it stopped altogether. I openend it up and everything looked perfect inside so it was a moisture issue. The battery still holds charge but it is definitely not designed for repair. I think 2 years is a little short considering the price so I think I will try a different brand.</li>
    <li> I am not flossing in the normal way. I never had. I just dont like it.&lt;br /&gt;So, when I saw this way of flossing, the airfloss, I said I will give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;I am much concerned of my teeth, but dental flossing is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the air floss and the comments are the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very good in the grip, very comfortable position in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;You fill it up with water and it is enough for 1 full flossing of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is scary the first time you use it, because:&lt;br /&gt;My gums were bleeding a little bit. maybe its because I havent ever used any kind of flossing and my gums are not used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the flow of water in your mouth is very strong, and thats a bit scary, but I guess it will be alright with time. You get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe though you would like to cover your moth with your hand while pressing the button to floss because small particles of water will splash out all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a good products, and even if scary from the pressure of water that it gives to the teeth, its still ok I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this type of flossing better than the normal dental flossing.</li>
    <li> broke after two months</li>
    <li> It is a great product that has helped my dental care greatly. I hate flossing this is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me?! I used it for a few weeks but the force of the jet seemed to lodge particles in my gums?! So I discontinued use.</li>
    <li> Not crazy about it, I think I will stick to a regular water pick. Makes a mess since you have to look up as to where you are shooting the stream, I don&#x27;t feel it cleans as good as the regular water pick type.</li>
    <li> I use this every day - my monthly checkups have improved greatly.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Really a great for kids with braces. I don&#x27;t know how they are expected to floss. The dentist has been on our case&lt;br /&gt;Lately and I am glad to have found this product. My husband and I have been sharing the kids for a week but then I can&#x27;t put vodka in there so I will get my own. ;^)</li>
    <li> This airfloss is fairly dengerous device&lt;br /&gt;I have healthy gums yet this device get me bleeding on every trial. After a week i gave up and returned it</li>
    <li> I have had my airfloss for around 9 months and it has turned out to be one of my worst top ten personal hygiene purchases.  I floss my teeth twice a day using the airfloss and the removable applicators only last four weeks max, before the fitting becomes too loose and starts to leak.  The applicator has to be removed each time after use if more than one person uses the airfloss machine.  New genuine applicators are very expensive to buy in Australia, so the airfloss is just not cost effective and I&#x27;ll be putting it in the bin as soon as I find another alternative product.  Adrian</li>
    <li> Mine stopped working shortly after I got it. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Just bought the new Air Floss from Sonicare - love it !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a flosser - and found the product easy to use and very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, I was surprised with the speed of the air/water droplet.&lt;br /&gt;However, I checked with my dentist and he told me it was nothing to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Air floss - it makes my daily flossing so much quicker and easy to do..&lt;br /&gt;no more excuses..&lt;br /&gt;I use it with my mouth rinse and found it very refreshing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cool gadget - and its great design fits nicely in my bathroom..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, my dentist told me my interdental gum health has significantly improved.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the investment! highly recommended</li>
    <li> I hate flossing. I was using a Reach Access Flosser, begrudgingly -- I don&#x27;t like flossing because it&#x27;s uncomfortable. The Sonicare flosser is pretty awesome. Although it was a little strange to use at first because of the air-mouthwash mixture (keep your mouth closed to avoid dripping), I got used to it quickly. I think it&#x27;s easy to zip through flossing all your teeth quickly. I did not have any bleeding. I use it in conjunction with a Sonicare toothbrush, whitening toothpaste and whitening mouthwash in the chamber, and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have braces and my dentist recommended this since I have not been flossing.  It works well and the charger life is great I charged it 4 weeks ago and it is still holding a charge.</li>
    <li> I am loving the results I am getting from this product.  In fact I am very pleased with sonicare.  All are very gentle to use but do big jobs!</li>
    <li> I like the feeling and it definitely gets out food particles the brush leaves behind between teeth but it doesn&#x27;t remove plaque as well as regular flossing.  But it&#x27;s quick so I can use it twice a day, more than I would ever manually floss.  Jusy is still out an the real benefit if any.</li>
    <li> Use it every day. Really works.</li>
    <li> Its hard to learn how to use but it works, especially if you have sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, but I had to find out for myself and I am very disappointed.  Does not work well if your teeth are tight together and totally ineffective on Bridgework.  My old  Waterpik is way more effective.  Lesson learned.....believe the reviews!</li>
    <li> I needed this Airfloss 30 years ago...I have big gaps in my teeth and it&#x27;s so had to keep them clean. well not so now, with this is little amazing thingy. The only thing that could be better with it was if the water tank was a little bigger and the water cap sealed a little better. but it still gets 5 stars because it&#x27;s still the best thing out there and when combined with the Philips sonic tooth brush you have a very powerful way to keep your teeth clean.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare Airfloss takes a little practice and a little getting used to, but surprisingly, it&#x27;s worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an easy to use little machine - plug in the charger and let it power up for 24 hours, fill the reservoir with water, prime the pump with a few button presses, and you&#x27;re off to the races. Usually a single button press between each tooth does the trick, a quick shot of air and water that blasts out smaller food particles pretty well. I can feel it working, cleaning as I work my way around, and it only takes a minute or two to be done. Bonus points for no nasty floss to throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s reasonably attractive and doesn&#x27;t take up much room either. The charging stand supports the Airfloss in an upright position, so you can stash it in a corner of your counter and barely notice its there until you need it. It doesn&#x27;t look like a Big Scary Dental Device - nice to have something not terribly intimidating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little on the messy side, though, especially the first few times you use it.  If you don&#x27;t place the head just right, it&#x27;s almost inevitable that you&#x27;ll get some spray reflected onto the bathroom mirror (or whatever or whoever happens to be in front of you). With practice, this gets better over time, but have a paper towel ready for those first few go-rounds. Also something to watch for the first few times: blood. Particularly if you&#x27;re like me and weren&#x27;t very good about flossing previously, you&#x27;ll likely see some bleeding the first few times you use the Airfloss. If you keep doing it, that goes away (which is a good sign your gums are healthier too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if there&#x27;s something big really stuck between your teeth, you may still need the old-school waxed floss now and again - the Airfloss doesn&#x27;t get everything, but it gets most of the noticeable stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to like the Airfloss much, but I can already see that as long as I don&#x27;t mind a little extra water to clean up, I floss a lot more often with this than I ever did with string floss. Color me pleasantly surprised... and doing a better job of keeping my teeth clean.ean up, I floss a lot more often with this than I ever did with string floss. Color me pleasantly surprised... and doing a better job of keeping my teeth clean.</li>
    <li> This electric flosser works great and I use it after I use my Sonicare toothbrush--that my dentist recommended and my checkups have been excellent.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare HX8111/02 Airfloss, Rechargeable Electric Flosser is very distructive to teeth that have been filled and capped.  The first time it was used a two year old filling was blown off.</li>
    <li> Pre-Invisalign, this unit didn&#x27;t pack enough of a punch to work on some of my tightly grouped molars.  Now that I&#x27;ve gone through Invisalign, it does work for them.  I&#x27;m sure this is a symptom of any air/water flossing solution, but I wanted to point it out for those interested in buying a solution like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As any dentist will tell you, this is not a solution to replace manual flossing.  If you want to make that easier, buy the floss picks instead.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by our dentist for my son who wears braces. He used it twice a day for four months and now it is completely dead. We followed all of the directions for care of the flosser. I was wary about buying it based on other similar experiences. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I have spent a great deal of money on my smile. I should receive an invitation when my dentist&#x27;s children graduate from college because I helped pay their tuition !!! This does a very good job at flushing out pieces of food. I have a lot of crowns and several permanent bridges. Some are hard to work around when flossing and I have to use threaders. This instrument helps a lot. Highly recommend it. Use mouthwash instead of water.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased one of these for myself, and liked it so much I got one for my sister, they are an excellent, fuss free way to floss between teeth, I find it much quicker and more effective than using  thread floss.</li>
    <li> I have been having my teeth cleaned twice a year and they are in great shape.  I want to continue to keep them the older I get and this removes food particles and stuffens my gums.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Phillips Sonicare Airfloss in late Jan.2014.  Followed the charging instructions, used the product for a week...It stopped working!  My wife&#x27;s lasted a few days longer.  Contacted the customer service department and the representative could not  have been more helpful. She was very lovely, took care of the RTA and had a second units out to me in a week. Making me believe this was a rarity.  Second units arrived and viola after a period of a week, a SECOND unit died. Called Phillips and told them what had happened.  They again indicated they knew of no similar problems. Thinking I was alone (not really!) I agreed to have a THIRD unit sent to my home.  Well, the same thing happened--the THIRD UNIT DIED after 10 days. It is now on the way back to Phillips and I am awaiting a determination if I am entitled to a refund. What was so problematic; the customer service representatives deny any knowledge similar customer problems. I now read all the similar customer complaints regarding these units....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Philips!!!! I will never buy any of their products again.</li>
    <li> This item was chosen because of the name and it did not disappoint me in any way from purchase to now.</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well! Would recommend to everyone, teeth feel cleaner and easy to use! Love this brand and how easy and effective it is!</li>
    <li> I bought mine from my Dentist. $82. I really liked it, but it only lasted three months! It just quit working and no place to have it serviced!</li>
    <li> This is easier to use than using the old fashion floss which makes you want to floss your teeth every day. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Does a good cleaning, and very easy and quick to use. [[ASIN:B004Y9AINC Philips Sonicare HX8111/02 Airfloss, Rechargeable Electric Flosser]] Pros: I like the ease of use Cons: Tip is a bit flat and does&#x27;nt seem to go between teeth easily.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the electric flosser.  It really seems to do the job.  I don&#x27;t think it makes the job easier but it appears to do it much better.</li>
    <li> I love this thing...Im a little skeptical that my dentist will think I&#x27;ve been flossing given it takes 15 seconds to floss my entire mouth however I love it, food  gets dislodged immediately.  A little gross given meat and popcorn kernels you didn&#x27;t know where there show up but I feel like it does a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought Airfloss at Target since day one it was released. The first one lasted about 2 months then I could not power it on. Philips sent a new one. The second one last another 2 months but still, exactly the same problem I had before: I could not power it on. Philips sent the second one to me. This one last little longer, and, after about 4 months, I could not power it on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I am little bit suspicious why Airfloss has such a high failure rate. I took it apart and found there&#x27;s large amount of water inside and water damages on PCB, metal frame and the motor. The water was from piston and nozzle receptor, where high pressure water passing through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I need another replacement from Philips, through they are very friendly and willing to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the water pressure from Airfloss is noticeably higher than those on the market. It will be very unsafe if it is not properly used: gum and dental damage may occur. I doubt if Philips have ever done any clinical trial about the side effect of long term usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Philips seriously considering a re-design.</li>
    <li> Great little unit. heaps of power. From my experience, place a little pressure so it doesn&#x27;t jump around in your month.  A+++</li>
    <li> The Airfloss seems to work very well. I have never really been a flosser, but this unit is nice. I have missed only 1 say since aquiring this product.....to tired.  ;-). I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The electric air floss by Sonicare is fantastic.  It leaves my mouth feeling fresh &amp; clean.  On the first few flosses I could even feel the plaque being blasted off.  I use it in conjunction with the Phillips electric tooth brush.  I would recommend this device to anyone, especially to those who accumulate a lot of plaque.  It is so much easier &amp; better than using dental floss.  Also the price &amp; service from Amazon.com was excellent.</li>
    <li> The product will remove food particles; however, because my teeth are tight without much space in between, the water spray back sprays in my mouth. I still floss!</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product before and I still love it.  It helps redux the stain as we&#x27;ll.  had a great checkup at the dentist and took way less time to get the cleaning done.  It had been 2 years and the dentist was amazed at how healthy my teeth were.  I also have the Sonic Care toothbrush and have been using them for at least 20 years.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd one and I love Sonic Care.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other water picks before, and this one is unique in that it only fires a single shot when it&#x27;s placed between your teeth, so it&#x27;s less wasteful; that said, if you don&#x27;t have it lined up perfectly, you&#x27;ll need to repeat the shot, which is only a problem because the reservoir on it is SUPER small, you really only get one shot per tooth intersection.  They should increase it by a half oz or something, so that you can have a couple extra sprays, because you almost never get them all perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does blast food and debris out of your teeth, but just doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as flossing with string.  When I stopped using this product (or flossing, period) because of the inconvenience of the SUPER small reservoir for a few weeks, then went back to using floss sticks, I could feel they got my mouth WAY cleaner; it was definitely a blood bath again!  Floss gets between your teeth and gums SO much better, and you can&#x27;t grow new teeth, so I haven&#x27;t used the Airfloss in months, and as soon as I finish typing this review, I&#x27;m putting it away for storage (lord knows what I&#x27;ll use it for, though...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR Novel idea, absolutely doesn&#x27;t replace traditional flossing.  Would not buy again, and would return it if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus:  The Sonicare toothbrush, however, is RIDICULOUSLY GOOD (and why I tried this product in the first place), and I HATE brushing my teeth with anything else.  You really feel like you just went to the dentist every day, and when you use an old fashioned manual toothbrush, you feel like an artist trying to paint a portrait using a floor mop, it just can&#x27;t be done well.  I take it on vacations with me, and it stays charged for a week (never been away from the charger longer than that).  The toothbrush is an absolute must buy!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dental hygienist but costs so much more in all stores in my neighorhood..Great price and very quick shipping</li>
    <li> Love this item. Works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;I was never a big flosser...didn&#x27;t like working the string between my teeth, but this makes it so easy and simple. Very little mess, since there is so little liquid. Excellent for cleaning bridge works.</li>
    <li> I think especially for people whose dental hygienists jump on them for not flossing, this could be the answer.  I won&#x27;t know how successful the device is for another five months, but I&#x27;m fairly confident I&#x27;ll show an improvement -- and Gladys won&#x27;t be unhappy with me :-)</li>
    <li> I ordered this item about 4 months ago but did not start using it until about 2 months ago as I was travelling. Now after just 2 months the opening for filling is just braking up. Everyday there is a new piece coming off. This item is only used by me, and has never been dropped, it is just disintegrating. Although I like the system, very soon I will not be able to use it any longer because it does not keep the water in. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing.  But this is simple.  I put water (Or Listerine) in there--place it between teeth and hit the buttom.  It&#x27;s really simple and quick to use!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice idea, and I try to care for my teeth the best I can, but I found it a little gimmicky.  Swishing with some mouthwash is just easier for me, and I found myself shying away from the airfloss after the first week. YMMV</li>
    <li> I would categorize this as a \\&quot;review in name only\\&quot; at this point since I haven&#x27;t purchased or used this product yet. BUT, I thought the following information might be of interest to some who are on the fence about buying one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my semi-annual dental checkup and teeth cleaning today. Not exactly newsworthy, but after each session my dental hygienist hands me a little bag of \\&quot;useful stuff\\&quot; to take home with me. It always includes the usual items (toothbrush, trial size tube of toothpaste dental floss, etc.) but this time it also contained a $10 off coupon for a Sonicare Air Floss appliance. The coupon can be redeemed at any retail store that sells the device. My dentist isn&#x27;t selling them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understood the message immediately. The message was that since she reminds me after every procedure that I do a really poor job of flossing - if I do it at all - this might be for me. In other words, maybe this is something that would get me to \\&quot;do something\\&quot; rather than nothing. Nothing was spoken, no pressure to buy, in fact the device wasn&#x27;t even mentioned. Just finding the coupon in the bag delivered a not subtle message that I understood clearly and received gratefully. The message was that I needed to do something - and since logical conversation hadn&#x27;t worked, here was a different suggestion for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughtful? Heck yes. A ringing endorsement of the product, no, but the fact that it WAS recommended by a dental professional definitely gives me confidence that it is a real tool and not a gimmicky gadget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy one. If your flossing practice resembles my flossing avoidance you might want to give some thought to doing the same.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I bought this thing.  It is difficult to aim and you have to hit the button every time you want the spray.  After 3 months of using this I had the worst dental check up ever.  The water tank is incredibly small and I have to fill it at least twice for every use.  I truly hate this thing.</li>
    <li> Sharp bursts of air and water leaves a clean feel in the mouth. However, I would be extremely skeptical about the claim that it is a replacement for flossing. A lot of mouthwashes and water jet devices have made such claims to the chagrin of dental and health professionals. There is no replacement for regular (ideally twice daily) flossing. Period. I would describe this device as a less cumbersome variation of the water pic. Such devices can be especially helpful for those with braces. But the science was long settled that they do not replace flossing. However, they do have a role as adjuncts to brushing and flossing. The word \\&quot;Airfloss\\&quot; is an outcome of a marketing department, not peer reviewed research. Flossing perturbs newly formed plaque well below the gum line. This device offers no pathway to possibly replicate that. What \\&quot;Airfloss\\&quot; can do is target some of the plaque on recessed surfaces missed by flossing/brushing due to tooth curvature.  To sum up the Airfloss does have a role in dental hygiene. Just don&#x27;t fall for the marketing BS.You can bet your socks ADA will not be endorsing floss replacement claims at any time. If you don&#x27;t floss often, the solution is to change your habit and start doing it. Periodontal gum disease isn&#x27;t just about your mouth. It has a bearing on heart attacks/strokes/diabetes and host of inflammatory factors in your blood. (I am a health professional).</li>
    <li> I have had peridontal disease since I was 16 yrs old and had three  gum surgeries. Since using this product my teeth, gums and breath never felt so good.  The airffloss broke after using it for a few days but plan to exchange it. I use it in conjunction with regular flossing and the sonicare tooth brush. The airfloss really gets the job completed and I am looking forward to my next peridontal cleaning and what they have to say. Dr. Carol Shochat, chiropractor in Tucson Az</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product during my last visit. I am certainly glad I listened and purchased the product. This is a great product, and my wife and I use it at least two times a day. It is easy to use, very light, and also fun to use. We use mouthwash vs water and the refreshing aspects of mouthwash are intensified with the mixture of air. Truly a great item. The proof will be when I return for my next hygiene appointment.</li>
    <li> Did not think it would work, but when we got it my wife tried it and fell in love with it. She uses it after every meal. Really does the job on removing those food particles.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.  You can really notice a change after use and my dentist was pleased on my return visit.  It is a powerful little sucker.</li>
    <li> I bought this to asset dental hygiene for a disabled person. I thought he might be able to use it more easily than WaterPik or conventional floss. BOY! Was I ever wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using it my (able bodied) self and it is a piece of junk. It does not remove  food that is left behind from the toothbrush. I still gets lots of detritus with conventional flossing after using the Sonicare AirFloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t even consider introducing it into the dental care of my paraplegic friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WaterPik is messy, but performs much better.Don&#x27;t waste your money on this travesty.</li>
    <li> For me, this product was worthless.  For several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - the reservoir for water says you should be able to get 2 flossing sessions out of one fill up.  Did not find this the case, so constantly refilling the water was a nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;2 - My teeth are fairly close together, so the little PUFF had no affect on anything.  my teeth didn&#x27;t feel clean at all, and even visible particles were still there.  The box even mentions that you should be manually flossing.... Uhhh  why would I buy an expensive flosser if I am still supposed to use regular floss?!&lt;br /&gt;3 - Its only meant to get at that area between teeth RIGHT at the gums, not along teeth edges, or below the gum line.  I am planning on getting a water pin which I had ages ago, since you can aim it at any place along your teeth that you feel need a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was useless.  I only got it because I really loved my sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare Toothbrush so much that I was very excited to see a new Sonicare product, thinking that if it lives up to the same standards as the toothbrush that it would be great.  What a let down...  this product is a complete waste of money, I am sticking with my WaterPik.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Works similarly to a waterpick; seems very effective at removing remaining food from between teeth and gums, expect good results at next visit to dentist.  Good companion to Phillips Sonic Care.</li>
    <li> Do you respond with equanimity to being bamboozled? Then this is the new gizmo for you! All those rave reviews, plus an enthusiastic recommendation from a personal friend? How could you resist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then it arrives, you open the package, you grok the gizmo, and you KNOW even before you try it out that you&#x27;ve been \\&quot;had\\&quot; once again. Still, you eagerly fill the tiny reservoir with the few tablespoons of water that it will hold, and you start zapping your most annoying inter-molar crevice, the place where food always gets lodged and needs to be picked or flossed before you can bear to continue your banal existence. And what happens? The gizmo clicks loudly, squirts a drop -- okay, a largish drop but not a jetting stream -- and that&#x27;s it. You&#x27;ve paid good money for an adult toy.</li>
    <li> I am not a big flosser but, having gotten gingivitis I needed something to help. This is a great product. Can&#x27;t wait to hear my Dental Hygienist comments too.</li>
    <li> This particular item was recommended by our  Dental Hygienist, and we went looking for the &amp;#34;flosser&amp;#34; in local retail stores.  The least expensive price we found was $99.99.  We turned to Amazon.com, and found it for $62.00.  The &#x27;flosser&amp;#34; works great.</li>
    <li> We love it, our dentist loves it. Cleanings go faster!!!! Well worth the money. We do use the old fashion floss twice a week also. Old habits are hard to break!</li>
    <li> While Philips provides great customer support - this will be the 4th replacement on this unit in a year. they just stop working - not through misuse (Philips couldn&#x27;t explain the problem happening) but something jams. Great when it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I must admit I am not a regular flosser. Although I do try to floss the conventional method. I find that incorporating the use of the Airfloss with my daily brushing has resulted in clinical improvement with the pockets depths around my teeth. I went from having 4&#x27;s and some 5&#x27;s to 3&#x27;s,2&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s and my dentist actually remarked &#x27;whatever you are doing is working&#x27;. I use Listerine in my Airfloss. On another note, the Airfloss quit working (would not spray) after just over a year. I went on Phillips website and found it has a 2 year limited warranty so called Phillips and I will be receiving a free replacement within the week. Thumbs up for Customer Service. I also have the Phillips Diamond Clean Toothbrush which is remarkable. Is quite a nice feature to be able to track your order on Amazon.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s perfect, wasn&#x27;t cheap, but thanks philips guys for wonderful product i&#x27;m lazy and need to add 9 words so here it is</li>
    <li> Good for someone who dont like flossing use the old method. I like it a lot. its simple to use and now i use it daliy</li>
    <li> For those of us who despise flossing...this is a great alternative.  Highly recommend this unit.  But as others have said (here and elsewhere) ... this is meant as an additional tool to regular flossing, blah-blah-blah.</li>
    <li> Has made my dentist happy!  My dentist also sold me the Sonicare toothbrush to go with this item.  I need to purchase replacement parts for PHilips Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Best alternative to flossing for those of us who can&#x27;t.  I have a Phillips toothbrush as well, they are great together.</li>
    <li> I really like this Phillips Airfloss so far.  I got it as an adjunct to regular flossing to use when I don&#x27;t feel like flossing sy after I have eaten during the day.  I use it with one of the whitening mouthwashes and find the effect very refreshing.  It is way too early to say whether it will last or not but I can say that I like it.  I am sort of an oral cleanliness nut and floss and use an oral irrigator as well.</li>
    <li> I took this to my dentist office...it was the first one they had seen.  I have been using it and they are pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought the Air Floss based on dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  Worked great for about 9 months and then died.  Philips sent a replacement, which lasted about 9-10 months until it died exactly the same way (appears to have a dead battery).  Philips refuses to replace again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Philips for a substandard design and lack of sensitivity to customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, no more Philips products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE my WaterPik and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I will have to see how well this thing works the next time I go for a cleaning.  My hygienist keeps asking if I floss, I keep saying now.  She suggested this Expensive machine; I hope it works.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my dental life!  It is so easy to use and my dentist has already noticed an improvement in my dental health. My mouth feels clean and fresh. So much easier and quicker than using floss.  Reaches those hard places.  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this retail model and after 2 weeks it died on me. I was not happy at all so luckily I could return it. I went and bought the Airfloss Dental Pro Model since it said it was a lot better. Well I am happy to report that the dental pro model is still working fine after 3 months. The battery life on the pro model is better too from what they said. That&#x27;s being said it worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes the tedious task of flossing much easier and throughly more enjoyable.  I don&#x27;t mind daily flossing anymore.</li>
    <li> I bought this guy with the Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus together. Well, I must admit the air floss cannot replace the flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER... I must admit I am not the guy who will do the flossing in regular basis.... This air floss provides a alternative mean in between a good flossing and no flossing :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an advice from my dentist... Use mouth wash instead of water when filling up the air floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh...  I can air floss all my teeth in a minute....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few flossers&#x27; (mainly Oral B ones) and all of them don&#x27;t even come close to this, I picked this up 6 months ago and so far it&#x27;s been great. The Airfloss saves water and doesn&#x27;t have to sit in the bathroom and is perfect for traveling, something others can&#x27;t really compete with.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t kid yourself that this isnt powerful! and becareful and only trigger it where it is to be fired, the blast of air and water is very powerful and it will surprise you!</li>
    <li> I have used a Water Pik for several years with great success.  My Dentist praises me every time I visit for the health of my gums and teeth.  My Water Pik after three years of use may be getting a little tired so I bought one of these Phillips Sonicare ones because it looked on the surface to be well designed and the manufacturer of course gave it high praise.  My thought was I would buy one of these and if I liked it I would buy another for my wife.  When I got home with this I gave it a quick try and thought,oh my, this doesn&#x27;t look to good, but  put it on the charger and the next morning gave it a thorough trial run.  My resulting opinion is that this thing is an absolute piece of trash and I wouldn&#x27;t pay even a dollar for it in a dollar store.  I have had other good products made by LG (Phillips) that were quite good, but this one does not live up to there usual standards and they should discontinue it immediately.  The loud sound the device makes strongly suggests that the science involved is a spring loaded piston that is pulled back by a motor and quickly released providing a short spurt of water and air.  It requires carefully positioning the nozzle into each separation between the teeth and then pushing the button on top of the device to get one small spurt of water and air.  It makes \\&quot;water flossing\\&quot; a very tedious chore and I doubt very much that this is as efficient as a water pick.  It is, however, much more expensive.  I bought mine at Target stores for $99.99 because I didn&#x27;t want to take the time for online order shipping.  I am glad I did it that way because the following day I returned it to Target for a full refund.  I then went to Walgreens and bought a slightly improved version of my Water Pik for only $40.00.  I gave that one to my wife and will continue using my three year old Water Pik because it works much better than the Phillips Sonicare piece of junk.  I would give this item zero stars, but Amazon requires at least one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for a number of months and it stopped working. I expected more from a company that is selling quality products. The warranty has expired and so it seems like they should stand behind their products and have a longer return time. I expected this to work for years not months.</li>
    <li> The pressure of the spray is not adjustable. I bought this because my jaw was broken in a fall and subsequently wired shut for 6 weeks. I wanted something to help with oral hygiene and thought this was perfect. Not so. My gums were bleeding and I had to call Phillips and get a replacement. Much to my disappointment, the new base was the same pressure. They instructions say it&#x27;s a pressure similar to &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; on a water pick. It&#x27;s more like a 8-9. Phillips missed the mark by not offering some sort of adjustability on their device.</li>
    <li> I first bought this item sometime in 2011. It worked well for about 9 months and then it just died. I bought a 2nd one in August 2012 and in February or March 2013 it started acting strangely....i.e....I would recharge it and then a few days later it would lose the charge. It went on like that for about a month...sometimes holding the charge for a full 2 weeks and sometimes holding the charge for just a few days. This past week it started doing something different. It would be fully charged but when I&#x27;d push the \\&quot;spray\\&quot; button it would only work once or twice and then the green light would go off. If I turned it on again it would work for a few seconds and then stop again. And so on......With the first unit I figured I just got a bad unit. But now that this has happened a 2nd time I feel it must be a basic problem with this flosser. While it worked I had no complaints with the effectiveness or ease of use. But I won&#x27;t buy this item again due to the problem with the battery. Just a few hours ago I looked around on Amazon and decided to go with the Waterpik Spray Flosser as it had no bad reviews. I think it is a plug-in unit and it looks a bit clunkier, but I notice that it comes with 6 tips and has 10 power settings so you can adjust the force of the spray. Once I&#x27;ve tried that unit for awhile I will post another review in case anyone wants to compare that item with the Phillips rechargeable flosser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised to see how well it removes those stubborn  things lodged between your teeth, I think it is much easier on the gums than flossing.</li>
    <li> I find the Airfloss easy to use. It is customer friendly.If you have a problem flossing the regular way, this is the way to go. Airfloss is better than not flossing at all.</li>
    <li> Being lazy about flossing, I thought this product would be a suitable substitute, but it isn&#x27;t. I wish it were.</li>
    <li> I really like this flosser!  It works as described.  Fast, and my teeth feel very happy after I use it.</li>
    <li> It is a little messy, doesn&#x27;t take the place of flossing but I like it.  The design is concise, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Since flossing is quite inconvenient I was very hopeful of this device. Unfortunately it feels pretty useless to me. Yes it&#x27;s very easy to use, just put water or listerine in the little reservoir and push the button (you&#x27;ll discover that mouthwash will make a much bigger mess than water)&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t have any visible/measurable effect, from I can tell it does not clean between the teeth so I&#x27;m back to flossing.</li>
    <li> I love this product cleans your teeth so well.</li>
    <li> This works great.  I did not floss before having this, so I cannot say how much better doing it by string would be, but my dentist has suggested I use traditional floss between my front teeth (I have bone loss there because of years of bad care).  If you don&#x27;t floss, this is a great start to taking care of your mouth.</li>
    <li> Sanitizer 70% reliable even after replacement. Excellent clean and polish. Important to my health. I like how easy it is to carry in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> i mean it does what it says it will i guess.... but its not very storng blasts of water. at least not enough to do anything to my chompers</li>
    <li> We had expected more from this product after reading earlier reviews and recommendations.  Use of floss is still necessary and still learning better techniques for use, to prevent tearing of soft tissue.</li>
    <li> THIS WILL NOT REPLACE YOUR FLOSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this item twice daily for two weeks. I have perio problems and believe this CAN AID FLOSSING AND NOT REPLACE FLOSSING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve rated this 5 stars because it works for my intentions. I purchased periogen and wanted a concentrated amount targeted directly to my teeth to remove and prevent tartar build up. My oral regimen is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Morning&lt;br /&gt;Oral breeze (like water pick but attaches to sink) in all crevices of teeth&lt;br /&gt;Brush with Oral B 3000 for 2 minutes with curacept 5% chlrohexidine gel&lt;br /&gt;Airfloss with 18cc periogen water mixture in all crevices of teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midday&lt;br /&gt;Floss with Glide floss&lt;br /&gt;Brush with mini portable toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily Evening&lt;br /&gt;Floss with Glide floss&lt;br /&gt;Oral breeze (like water pick but attaches to sink) in all crevices of teeth&lt;br /&gt;Brush with Oral B 3000 for 2 minutes with curacept 5% chlrohexidine gel&lt;br /&gt;Airfloss with 18cc perscription strength tartar control mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this item to distribute concentrated perio treatment, this is a great item for you. But this will not replace flossing.</li>
    <li> I hate flossing and never do it as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This electric flosser is great and very effective.  It removes a bunch of food particles from my teeth after brushing and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning and night.... with mouthwash most of the time. I love it.. my teeth feel dentist clean !</li>
    <li> Quality product that works well and is easy to use. I recommend the product, it was recommended to me by my dentist.</li>
    <li> I believe this did more harm than good. It was so powerful that my gums would bleed every time I used it. My dental hygienist said that she didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in my dental health. She even recommended that I stopped using it. I could get a lot of traditional floss for the price of this and I&#x27;ll gladly do just that.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 2 now that last 1 month or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy one after reading this review, you deserved it.</li>
    <li> On the advice of my family&#x27;s dentist I purchased one of these.  It worked great.  Unfortunately after a year+ of use (2-3 times a day) it died.  I switched over to a \\&quot;waterpik\\&quot; type system which I do not enjoy using nearly as much as I did this Airfloss.</li>
    <li> Teeth feel good after using.- requires refilling often. I like it better than using floss. I have only been using it a few weeks.</li>
    <li> The DDS will agree that it does not replace the floss. You still need to floss. However brings a great stimulus to use Listerine between your teeth and close to your gum. On my last cleaning at DDS office it was noticed an improvement on my gum and less painful with the cleaning. I do recommend especially with you are not into flossing or either mouth wash. It improves the hygiene.  I have not given 5 stars because it does not come with a travel protective case, the battery does not give you 2 weeks, 1 week only and the charger is not USB.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Strong pulsing cleaner. May bee a bit too strong if you have bad gums, so hold it a bit away. Cleans well between teeth. Can add mouthwash for extra cleaning.</li>
    <li> Rediculous product. Messy to fill. Have to continuously hit the button over and over again to accomplish...I&#x27;m not sure what. Worst product that I&#x27;ve purchased in quite some time. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 1.5 years....</li>
    <li> After 6 months of use with my daughter and I removing/swapping our own flossing tips daily, the actual flossing tip port wore to the point water spurted everywhere on each use. Philips replaced the unit via warranty with a note confirming the product is not designed for multiple users, i.e. it is for personal use and they would not replace the unit again.  6 months on the replacement unit is now spurting water.  This product is great for people living alone or who will not share! However, it useless for a family flossing device.</li>
    <li> I own a sonicare toothbrush and could not be happier with the results from that product. That being said, I purchased the airfloss because I was sick and tired of flossing every night and subsequently have STILL had to floss every night since this product is a piece of JUNK. I would avoid it and simply just light four 20&#x27;s on fire instead.</li>
    <li> I have been using my Philips Sonicare Airfloss flosser for several weeks now and really enjoy the ease and convenience of flossing that way. A previous review that I had read noted that it doesn&#x27;t do as well in areas where teeth are very close together. That may be somewhat true and I sometimes supplement with regular floss in some tighter areas. However, the Airfloss seems to keep my teeth very clean and I don&#x27;t have problems with my gums bleeding at all now that I use it regularly. The flosser is compact in design if you are traveling and lasts a long time without recharging.</li>
    <li> This was not quite what I had envisioned, but it does work pretty well.  It does not replace old fashioned dental floss, but it does get the smaller more hard to reach areas much better than traditional floss.</li>
    <li> Prefer to stick with waterfloss from Waterpix.&lt;br /&gt;This airfloss thing is not really confortable to use and it to press the button repeatedly to use it instead on/off.</li>
    <li> Product is not high quality--I had to have it replaced twice in one year because it simply stopped working.  The second replacement stopped working 9 months later and the company would not replace it despite the fact that it was still within warranty.  I will not buy another one as I don&#x27;t think the limited benefit is worth the hassle of trying to obtain a working model</li>
    <li> i had quite a few. They don&#x27;t last</li>
    <li> I think it is horrible. I have always floss my teeth and I was under the impression that this product would be more effective; I was greatly mistaken. The product shoots out a small burst of air with the mouthwash that one would provide. Imagine a bottle of cologne or perfume filled with mouthwash against your teeth and you press a button for one pump; it&#x27;s very similar to that scenario. It is a waste of money and time; I am going to just stay with flossing.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product which broke within a week despite warranty for 30 months.  Phillips needs to send it back to the drawing board. Update:  Purchased a Water Pik flosser and very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It is supposed to work like a floss without the hassle of using &#x27;threaded&#x27; floss. But it is not effective as regular floss. I would rate its effectiveness as 10% compared to using traditional flossing. I tried it and always had to go back to using regular floss to clean the in between gaps of my teeth. Cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife last year and it was working great for her.  Did exactly what it was supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After twice daily use for 12.5 months, it just quit working.  I suspect the rechargable battery died.  The power light comes on, push the button and it makes a noise then turns itself off.  That works out to about $8 a month so I give it three stars since it did what it was supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going back to the water pik.  Not as light or small, but it keeps working and does the same thing.</li>
    <li> After almost one Year of use, my Philips Sonicare gave up the ghost. It had worked in a satisfactory way until then, easily holding a charge for up to one month!&lt;br /&gt;Being still within factory warranty, I received a replacement BUT! it seemed like a whole new (worse) product. the button &amp;#34;trigger) did not easily engage, and the Philips Sonicare died after about one week. As I had extended warranty, I again called Philips, and was again sent a replacement unit. - This happened three times, all units died within a few weeks of use, and the &amp;#34;trigger&amp;#34; performance on all replacements was very sluggish. I now have four non working units, and guess what, I am NOT going to buy another.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly hope others have had a better experience, but for me, it is two thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I have never been a big time flosser, but I know it&#x27;s needed for healthy gums.  I started using this a week ago.  My gums have never been so healthy looking!  This thing is amazing.  I fill it with Listerine and go crazy on ridges between my teeth.  it&#x27;s slightly painful the first time, but once you get used to it, your mouth will definitely appreciate it.</li>
