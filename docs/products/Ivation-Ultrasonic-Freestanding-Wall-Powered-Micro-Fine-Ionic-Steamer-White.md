      <li>I was really enjoying it before it broke.</li>
      <li>Overall I was very happy with this face steamer and would recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!!!!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and good instructions, although I agree with others here that they do not explain HOW to use essential oil though they are happy to use it in their advertising, which is not a practice that builds trust in their commitment to the buyer.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
      <li>My face felt soft and it worked great with my skin care routine.</li>
      <li>I like to put a drop or two of tea tree oil in the water reservior, which is fairly easy to remove and refill.</li>
      <li>So easy to set up.</li>
      <li>It was working fine</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use, steam is not too hot.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and it looks like a pretty vase.</li>

      <li>Great steam and just enough for cleaning pores.</li>
      <li>I filled the water chamber with filtered water as suggested.  </li>
      <li>The water tank is cheap put together with glue and bands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no dermatologist or cosmetologist, but I do know that I enjoy the sensation of hot steam blowing in my face and the refreshing feeling afterwards.</li>
      <li>great natural product for a more natural skincare regime than harsher cleansers and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The steamer is the perfect size, it&#x27;s small</li>
      <li>my skin looks more radiant after the first use.</li>
      <li>I use distilled water, and recommend that others do too - other wise you are steaming chemicals and impurities into your face!  </li>
      <li>Blemishes are fading and my pores are clean.</li>
      <li>Worked great the first time, but after a couple of uses the blue light started flickering and would turn off, which corresponded with a significant decrease in the steam coming out.</li>
      <li>love my new steamer!!</li>
      <li>Cool Mist to Shrink Pores for Visibly Tighter Skin, as well as Soothe &amp; Relieve Skin</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m able to put it away without it taking up too much space.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this steamer it heats up quickly and has so much steam.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly so I can use it spur of the moment if I want.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it turns on and hearts up quickly.</li>
      <li>You will also want to make sure your unit sits on something tall enough so its top is at about the height of your chin.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
      <li>It puts out ultra-fine mist, and shuts off when the water runs out, which is just the right amount of time for a good facial steaming.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>Some stated that 10 mins isn&#x27;t long enough, but to me it was perfect.  </li>
      <li>Once I turned on the Nano facial steamer I fell in love with it!</li>
      <li>It opens her pores so that the acne products can better penetrate her skin and help keep her skin clear.</li>
      <li>When water is turned into mist, it can much easily be absorbed into your skin.</li>
      <li>Nice stream of steam to really open those pores!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was really in love with this product!  It was working fine and my skin looked great.  However, within 2 days of receiving this, the seal on the water tank had a slight crack in it.  Then, the pin in the water tank completely fell apart leaving the unit completely unusable!  I&#x27;m very extremely disappointed in the manufacturing of the water tank.  I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund and will buy another brand.</li>
    <li> Really like the product and the steam it produces but the reservoir which holds the water is tiny. The steam action lasts about 10 minutes; so I&#x27;m constantly refilling it. Is there a way to get a bigger reservoir?</li>
    <li> This product fell apart after three uses. The little container that you fill with water broke apart into several pieces. The lid cracked, the rubber seals would not stay on and the hot water ran out from the bottom all over my lap. I want to return the product but since it has been about three weeks since I received it, I&#x27;m not sure if I can. In addition, the two times that I did use it, the steam does not last long and you have to hold it to your face to really get any decent amount of steam. I would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> Steamers can be used as a part of a dedicated skin care regime or for aromatherapy purposes and this unit provides both functions. When water is turned into mist, it can much easily be absorbed into your skin. The unit provides it excellent, consistent, and fine mist that permeates within a reasonable sitting distance from the unit (this will depend on your rooms specific general climate i&#x27;d imagine) but you don&#x27;t have to sit with your head over the unit aka towel and the sink method for the common cold. Obviously the closer you get the &#x27;most&#x27; pure benefit with ensue but being comfortable would be something i&#x27;d really require.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device gives you options of either hot or cold steam which are for the following benefits as per manufacturer recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Select Hot Steam to Relax Skin, Open/Unclog Pores, Remove Oil, Dirt &amp; Grime, Aid or Even Replace Chemical-Laden Scrubs &amp; Peels&lt;br /&gt;Select Cool Mist to Shrink Pores for Visibly Tighter Skin, as well as Soothe &amp; Relieve Skin Made Sensitive by Acne, Sunburn or Rough Exfoliation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply dip a cotton wool ball in lavender and pop it into the chamber and the device integrates that into its mist which can provide the intended therapeutic function of the oil - Or like me i just like the natural scent floating around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great natural product for a more natural skincare regime than harsher cleansers and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for review.</li>
    <li> This really works well.  I love it.</li>
    <li> love it..works great for me.gonna get more as gift for friends</li>
    <li> I love this steamer. I have had steamers that were more expensive but I must say I like this one the best. I must admit, I was a little apprehensive but I am so glad I purchased this item. I was very pleased with the seller. Product was neatly packaged and I received it on the date they provided.</li>
    <li> I have several steamers... But this one is by far the BEST!!!! it only takes 40 seconds to see the steam and to use it.  It lets you put in enough water to use it for 10 mins.  My face felt soft and it worked great with my skin care routine. I bought it on Dec 26 2014 and received it on Dec 28, 2014.  Fast shipping!!!!. I love facials and do them all the time, I would recommend this to all of my family and friends.  THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hesitant giving this unit 5 stars for one reason - time. In my opinion in order for any device like this to get 4-5 stars it needs to do what you expect of it for the amount of time you expect it to do it. Therefore, a review like this should realistically be done after a year or more of use. Having said that this unit compares very well to the much more expensive Panasonic unit and so far has worked as expected. It gives plenty of steam and can even seem a touch too hot if you get too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At about a quarter of the price of the Panasonic I would say it&#x27;s a good value and definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> The Ivation Ultrasonic Facial Steamer is a compact unit that doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the countertop. It takes about 30 seconds to &amp;#34;get up to steam&amp;#34; but when it does it lasts a while. I like to put a drop or two of tea tree oil in the water reservior, which is fairly easy to remove and refill. I personally wish it held more liquid, but it is good for about 20 minutes which should be long enough for most steam treatments. I&#x27;m no dermatologist or cosmetologist, but I do know that I enjoy the sensation of hot steam blowing in my face and the refreshing feeling afterwards. At nearly 44, I&#x27;m aware of the benefits of a facial steam bath both for the skin AND the lungs and air passages. This little Ivation IVA-2331 unit puts out a lot of steam in a very consistent stream, and has an attractive glowing light present while doing so. It is pricy, but it is a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those who enjoy this sort of beauty product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a trial unit for objective review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works great. Don&#x27;t overdo it. perhaps only 1-2 times per week.</li>
    <li> This really helps with treatments and masks.</li>
    <li> Have had it a short time so 4 stars.  Arrived in timely fashion well packaged.  Easy to use and good instructions, although I agree with others here that they do not explain HOW to use essential oil though they are happy to use it in their advertising, which is not a practice that builds trust in their commitment to the buyer.  I like that it does not have any plastic odor which is why my old one, though still functional, is going to the thrift store.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly. Heats up quickly.  I am not sure who is enjoying it more. My children or myself. Feels great, very pampering. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I think this is great!  Along with a high quality facial mask, this really helps my skin!  I had a different model from a different manufacturer that I also loved, but the switch broke after less than a year.  These are all made in China so we will see how long this one lasts.</li>
    <li> Great steam and just enough for cleaning pores.</li>
    <li> Ivation Ultrasonic Facial Steamer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was a little uncertain how this trial of Nano Facial Steamer would turn out but I should not have been. First of all I love the look of it, it&#x27;s sleek and professional looking. I followed directions and carefully let the steam move along my face. I was amazed at how good it felt. I actually could feel my skin absorbing in the moister. I was impressed with all that it says it will do, like balancing skin oils, refining pores and giving tender and smoother skin. I have used it for about a week now. I don&#x27;t overdue my time but I have to say that I definitely have seen a positive improvement to my skin. This really is a very good product that must be used wisely, and in doing so will make a positive upgrade to your skin. I like it and am happy to recommend it.  Product received for a honest review.</li>
    <li> The box arrived well packaged and all the contents were inside.  In the box is the unit, already put together.  There is no assembly required.  Prior to use, I read over the basic instructions and incorporated a little common sense (smile) and began the process.  I filled the water chamber with filtered water as suggested.  turned on the unit and I want to say that within less than the time that is advertised, the steam started to emit and emit strongly.  I positioned my face according to the instructions and also moved it around so that the steam hit the areas that are more troublesome.  It felt great.  The steam can get hot, but again, you will feel if you&#x27;re too close to the unit.  Some stated that 10 mins isn&#x27;t long enough, but to me it was perfect.  My face was sweating from the steam and it felt like it was given a good vapor cleanse.  On a side note, it also opened up my nasal passages and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my sense of smell was (LOL).  It is recommended that you use a moisturizer immediately following steaming but in my case I used an oxygen mask and while today is the first day I have used this combo and although my skin is very soft, I would say I will have a better idea over the next couple of days as to how well it works.  I tend to find that my skin shows how well it reacted to a product after a few days.  Will update again.  This is a nice little addition to anyone who wants to do at home spa treatments on their face either as an alternative to going to the spa or as a filler for in between spa treatments.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer sent a review product and my wife tried it out and provided her review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This is a nice steamer overall. There are several things I like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It heats up quickly so I can use it spur of the moment if I want.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does hot or cold mist. Sometimes I want the hot to relax my skin and sometimes I want to cold (actually cool rather than really cold) to tighten my skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. It puts out plenty of mist (but see below).&lt;br /&gt;4. It can do aromatherapy although I didn&#x27;t try that much and don&#x27;t usually use it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things that could be better.&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of water and only lasts about ten minutes. Sometimes  I want a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s hard to get the right distance. If you go too close it can be too hot but if you back away too far you lose the effect. Holding my head in the right place is a little difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still all in all this is a good home steamer without being really expensive. For a star rating I say four, meaning that it&#x27;s very good but not perfect.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  I hope it continues to work long term.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice, it does what it supposed to. No complaints. This is my first one  so nothing to compare it to.</li>
    <li> Very nice steamer. It puts out ultra-fine mist, and shuts off when the water runs out, which is just the right amount of time for a good facial steaming.&lt;br /&gt;Very refreshing. I was hoping to put essential oils in it, but couldn&#x27;t find any info in the instruction booklet that says it&#x27;s ok to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has acne. She loves it. It opens her pores so that the acne products can better penetrate her skin and help keep her skin clear. We could see a real improvement right away.</li>
    <li> Once I turned on the Nano facial steamer I fell in love with it! I found it to be very beneficial. I have been using this every night before I hope in the shower. I like to open my face up and then hop in the shower and clean my face with face wash. I defiantly notice a difference after using the face streamer. I notice my face feels clear. My face hasn’t broken out at all. It take about 30 seconds to heat up the water then the steamer will slowly release mist into the air. If you get too close to the face streamer you going to notice how hot the mist is. The mist is hot so do be careful.  I founded that with one fill of water you get a lot of mist.  The face streamer is a good size to the point you could travel with if you had to. Overall I was very happy with this face steamer and would recommend this product. I was provided a free sample in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> Used not even three times and plastic part of the water reservoir just crumbled. Looks like this has happened to other customers too. I read all the instructions carefully, only used filtered water, and was careful to let the until cool down after using. Super disappointed, it turned out to be such a cheap piece of junk. I was really enjoying it before it broke.</li>
    <li> Worked great the first time, but after a couple of uses the blue light started flickering and would turn off, which corresponded with a significant decrease in the steam coming out. I might have just gotten a bum unit, but will be returning.</li>
    <li> This little steamer produces a lot of steam, and I didn&#x27;t smell any chemicals like others did.  It definitely cleaned my pores.</li>
    <li> love my new steamer!! Does as good a job as from a professional facial!!  It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; looks good on my dresser.  Will buy one for my second home &amp; it would make a great gift!!  What a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! First steamer I&#x27;ve every had but it turns on and hearts up quickly. The stream covers my whole face. I usually watch TV and stream my face every evening for like 20min (until the water runs out). Within just 2 weeks my face has improved greatly. Blemishes are fading and my pores are clean.</li>
    <li> This facial steamer works well and so far I am pleased with my purchase. It is small which I like and simple to use. I am glad that I purchased this item.&lt;br /&gt;georgia</li>
    <li> On page 6 of the instructions it states &amp;#34;Do not mix water with ANY OTHER substance, such as lotion, aromatic oil, etc, otherwise it may cause burns, malfunctions, or shorten the life of the main unit.&amp;#34; My main purpose for using this product was the aromatherapy function that was clearly advertised in the description and the title. I may be sending this back...just know if you intend to use oils that the instruction booklet clearly states several times not to add ANYTHING to the water or reservoir.</li>
    <li> Love this!  I use it everyday !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve paid a lot of money to go for a facial in the past. It doesn&#x27;t happen often but I always like the fresh feeling I got afterwards. This is a great machine to do it yourself. It heats up super fast, I get steam in about 1 minute. It is really hot so you have to be careful how close you get as well. The pink opening has a pretty swirl in it, like a flower. It is a good height for sitting in front of as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and the water reservoir holds just enough. I&#x27;ve also used it for times that I want a little moisture in my nasal and sinus passages or for a dry/sore throat - kind of like being in a steamy shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my teenage daughter who is fighting some adolescent skin issues.  It works great.  Her skin cleared out.  She goes back to the steamer when a breakout occurs.</li>
    <li> Nice stream of steam to really open those pores!  I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I really feel it is doing something positive for my face!  I previously bought the Conair brand and that barely made any steam that I gave up until I found this one.</li>
    <li> I only used this facial steamer for 3 weeks. Where the tray pulls out to fill with purified water it all fell apart could not put it back together so this morning I through it in the garbage. MMM what a waste of $40.00. Going to Sally&#x27;s beauty supply to purchase a better one and know it won&#x27;t fall apart. This is junk your selling for the price.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the face. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Melted the reservoir after 5th use</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:e10c6afb753e6ad7629fe6a48a5cc6d1]] This feels like you are in a sauna when you are directly in front of it.  I like the feel of it but it quickly goes through that little bottle of water in less then 10 minutes which is why I dropped it a star.  Otherwise it&#x27;s pretty good.  I received this item for a honest review.</li>
    <li> I just opened this facial steamer and there is really nothing easier to use and setup. Pull the water reservoir at the back and fill with water - distilled water is recommended as tap water or mineral water can cause calcification and clog the steamer. This is what you usually see inside old humidifiers that are hard and are hard to clean. Put back the reservoir, plug the device and within half a minute, the steam will spew out from its flared mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put your face in front of the steamer at a distance of around 6 inches. Recommended treatment is about 5 minutes and try not to exceed 10 minutes. After treatment you can use facial scrub and apply serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Device works as described. It is compact, simple and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this as a sample review item.</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH IT! It is broken after 3 weeks. If you really want to buy it, please use it as quickly as possible, it&#x27;s better if this product broken before deadline, so you can return back. Otherwise you will like me, when I found broken, the product already past return deadline!</li>
    <li> I bought this end of January and have been using it once a week. I have always taken care of the steamer after each use. I make sure to pour out all the water from the base unit and the water container and let it air dry before storing it. After the 10th so time...the steamer broke! The nozzle no longer dispense water into the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great while it last...but really?! $50 for 10 time uses is $5 each time I steam my face? With that price i could have gone to a professional!</li>
    <li> Good product and delivered as promosed</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and worked great for the first 2 times. The water tank is cheap put together with glue and bands. Water started to drip and the steam reduced dramatically.  Its going back!</li>
    <li> I have only had the steamer for about 2 weeks, but I can honestly say I like it and would suggests it to anyone with acne. I have severe acne and my regime so far is to wash my face, steam for 3-5 min, apply charcoal mask for 10 min,then apply acne products of choice. I do this every night before I go to bed. My acne has calmed down greatly and I assume the steamer helps open my pores for better penetration of the acne product and mask.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!  I have had this steamer for three weeks and have used it twice a week.  I have had acne prone skin all of my life and now that I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s, I also need to worry about wrinkles :(  The steamer is the perfect size, it&#x27;s small so I&#x27;m able to put it away without it taking up too much space.  It&#x27;s very simple to use, plug it in, add water to the compartment, turn it on and it steams for about 8-10 minutes.  It does have a plastic scent to it, but it does go away with time and continued use.  I&#x27;ve added tea tree oil only once and it worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just in case you are not sure what to do, the following regimen has been wonderful for my skin.  First I wash my face with my Clarisonic using a gentle, oil-free, soap-free cleanser.  Then I steam and I immediately put on a mask (Peter Thomas Roth Sulfur Cooling Mask).  I follow with a gentle toner (Thayer&#x27;s Alcohol-Free Cucumber Witch Hazel), an acne clearing gel (Peter Thomas Roth AHA/BHA gel), and lastly a brightening serum (Peter Thomas Roth De-Spot--this stuff is AMAZING).  I know it seems like a lot of products but I do this twice a week and my skin has been responding incredibly well.  My breakouts heal much quicker and my skin has been so soft and clearer.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of face steamer&#x27;s ,  this one could steam wallpaper off the wall&#x27;s . I wish It could take oils . but it works GREAT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this steamer it heats up quickly and has so much steam. It is very easy to use and it looks like a pretty vase.</li>
    <li> Love this one! No wired smell.Steam is not hot but hot enough. my skin looks more radiant after the first use.</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised. Great price and great value. I enjoy my ultrasonic facial and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an effective and affordable facial steamer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful steamer.  I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> It arrived in time. I like it. I preferred to spend more on this type of steamer than the &#x27;hooded&#x27; ones, where you have to continuously keep your head bent over. And the one review where the hot water burst on their face really scared me! So I zeroed in on this &#x27;open air&#x27; steamer. It gives a steady stream of steam in virtually no time. So easy to set up. Just fill the container with water, fix, plug in and switch on. I wouldn&#x27;t have minded steam for longer than  8 to 10 mins, but the good thing about  this is that it&#x27;s so handy, and simple, you can use it everyday. Though perhaps every other day would be better.&lt;br /&gt;If you pack it  away,  you&#x27;ll hardly ever use it. I intend to store mine close at hand and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be steaming frequently. My skin will than me for it!</li>
    <li> Steam with a lot of smell</li>
    <li> The user guide says to leave the steam for up to 10 mins but after 8 minutes the water supply seems to dry up and it gives a dry steam with a burn smell. So I do not to use it for no more than 7 min. Otherwise  this facial steamer does what it says. It is very easy to use, steam is not too hot.  I&#x27;ve been enjoying using it twice a week for almost a month.</li>
    <li> It totally does the job.</li>
    <li> This facial Steamer is great for home facials.  I have used this steamer once a week for 3 months and already see results.  I apply a facial mask then sit and steam.  My pores are smaller, lines are less noticeable, and my face is softer.  I use distilled water, and recommend that others do too - other wise you are steaming chemicals and impurities into your face!  This little steamer puts out a moderate, steady stream of steam.  I&#x27;m not sure how long a full reservoir of water steams for - perhaps 7-10 minutes.  When the reservoir is empty the steam stops, other wise there is a steady, continuous flow of steam.  I have not had any problems with splattering or sputtering hot water escaping from the steam hole.  It&#x27;s relaxing - me time.  One thing to keep in mind is this is NOT a hand held unit.  You sit in front of it and will need to lean forward slightly, so make sure you have a comfy place to sit.  You will also want to make sure your unit sits on something tall enough so its top is at about the height of your chin.  The lower the unit the more you will have to lean forward.  You cannot add oils to this unit so if you are looking for aroma therapy - keep looking.  Having this unit has enticed me to take time for myself.  I&#x27;m worth it - so are you.  Take time for yourself, and relax.  Getting this little steamer was the first step in the right direction.  My skin looks and feels better - I feel better too.</li>
