      <li>I have always had acne, but lucky me I get cystic acne.</li>
      <li>Now, my face isn&#x27;t perfect, I am wearing makeup (last pic) to cover the scars and pigmentation Unblemish left!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m not a picky shopper, nor am I one to judge a product too quickly.</li>
      <li>This is more than the normal pricing if you go through a consultant.  </li>
      <li>Everything you said is exactly what my experience has been with Unblemish!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s honestly a product that actually works.&lt;br</li>

      <li>I purchased through a consultant but since I cannot leave a review on the R&amp;F website (convenient right?)</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products to clear my blemishes, this is the first product to work.</li>
      <li>Also, even though I&#x27;m better off using Nature&#x27;s Cure, I still need to work on getting rid of the scars left by all this acne</li>
      <li>and I lost my chance to return the first one too.</li>
      <li>Also, even though I&#x27;m better off using Nature&#x27;s Cure, I still need to work on getting rid of the scars left by all this acne</li>
      <li>I use 1/2 of a pea size of the cleanser, one quick splash of the toner, one light pump of the gel and an equally tiny amount of the lotion.</li>
      <li>I use 1/2 of a pea size of the cleanser, one quick splash of the toner, one light pump of the gel and an equally tiny amount of the lotion.</li>
      <li>Unblemish is made by Rodan &amp; Fields, the same creators of Proactiv (they sold the proactiv line and came up with this overpriced, supposedly amazing new formula), it costs 3 times more than Proactiv but they promise positive results or your money back.</li>
      <li>Before using Unblemish, my acne was pretty much under control except for the occasional breakout (mostly cysts).  </li>
      <li>But to me, clear skin is worth the money.</li>
      <li>If you really want to try these products let me help you out with cheaper prices and a guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unblemish does NOT work, I used it religiously as indicated; even while using it I never felt my face was completely clean.</li>
      <li>I had mild acne to begin with, but thought it would be a shot to use this to finally get rid of it once and for all.</li>
      <li>Since using the product, I still have the same amounts of breakouts as always, but now also have a tremendous number of blackheads-</li>
      <li>but I still had high hopes and if it did work</li>
      <li>I have tried every possible skincare line known to man and had pretty much given up when my boss told me about R&amp;F, so I figured what could I lose?</li>
      <li>This line has seriously changed my life for the better!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with very mild acne since I was a teen, I used Proactiv for 10 yrs and it helped control it, but I recently quit it because I wanted to try something else, something that would even prevent the 2-3 cystic pimples I&#x27;d get once a month during &amp;#34;those days&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I was on cloud nine when I received the new toner in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and i feel like a new person.  </li>
      <li>was clear!</li>
      <li>First of all you don&#x27;t know if what you&#x27;re getting from this seller is in fact the actual product, even if it is the products you may receive from here could be expired!</li>
      <li>If you are interested in the products, please contact an independent consultant to order.</li>
      <li>I had light scaring, dark spots, and patches of pimples that would never go away.</li>
      <li>It made me depressed, self conscious, and embarrassed to even go out!</li>
      <li>anyway, I fell for it and ordered another 2 month regimen; 3 and a half months (from the first use) my face got like this (first 4 pictures, of course).</li>
      <li>I am 33 yrs old, I had NEVER seen my face like that</li>
      <li>and they have not only faded so much</li>
      <li>I also never found a consultant so I was buying direct from the company, and they had an auto enrollment plan where they just sent you product.</li>
      <li>that Im pushing 40, I realized I had to do something because I&#x27;m too young AND too old for my face to look like this.  </li>
      <li>If you have products left over when your replenishment is ready after 60 days, YOU can have it shipped again</li>
      <li>I wish I could give this to my 14 year old self....</li>
      <li>I am 30 and have struggled with cystic acne since I was 11 years old.</li>
      <li>guarantee you get directly from Rodan + Fields.</li>
      <li>it made my skin really flaky and red with sores.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much CHEAPER and SAFER if you buy from an actual consultant&#x27;s web site, plus you get a 60 day money back guarantee.</li>
      <li>8 wks went by and my face, far from getting better, it got way WORSE.</li>
      <li>Try the other website first.</li>
      <li>I ended up going to a professional demotologist and paying a total of 480, for cremes, to correct my face.</li>
      <li>then I was willing to pay that every other month!</li>
      <li>First, when I initially ordered, I received the wrong toner, and the seller was quick to replace the toner with the one I wanted!</li>
      <li>even though I was ready to return it, she somehow brainwashed me that I should try another 2 months with a different toner because the one toner I ordered gave me A GAZILLION blackheads, it was like every single pore was clogged, even in places where you can&#x27;t see my pores like my jaw line!</li>
      <li>Rodan + Fields products can only be sold by direct independent consultants.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve broken out more in the last 4 months than I did for all of 2014.  </li>
      <li>Not only did my acne not get better, it got incredibly worse.  </li>
      <li>This is by far one of the most expensive cosmetic/acne product I have ever paid for/</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My son has horrible acne cyst.  His skin is clearing up and the scarring is looking so much better!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have started a blog on this product to track my progress. You can find it here: http://savetheselfie.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-before.html</li>
    <li> I literally tried it from my cousin. She had awful Acne always then I noticed a few months ago when she came to visit her face was clear! No make up. I asked her how she did it she did mention it was expensive. I stayed with her a few days. I have never had serious acne problems any ways. Just really big open pores and dark spots and sort of uneven skin. which is why I hated leaving without make up. And even then you could see my pores with my make up. I only friend this product in 3 days and my face had such a dramatic improvement! This is by far one of the most expensive cosmetic/acne product I have ever paid for/ the pan is once my face is cleared up stem to a cheaper rand to continue with some kind of acne treatment. But I totally recommend it! (I did buy it at the website it was 30/40 dollars cheaper)</li>
    <li> I purchased through a consultant but since I cannot leave a review on the R&amp;F website (convenient right?), I thought I would leave one here.  Before using Unblemish, my acne was pretty much under control except for the occasional breakout (mostly cysts).  Not only did my acne not get better, it got incredibly worse.  I&#x27;ve broken out more in the last 4 months than I did for all of 2014.  And the worst part is that with every blemish I&#x27;ve gotten, I&#x27;ve gotten a new mark to show for it.  Now I have to try to undo all the damage these products have done to my face.  I am VERY disappointed in the products &amp; the amount of money I wasted on them.</li>
    <li> I wanted to respond to &amp;#34;Mrs. Gal&#x27;s&amp;#34; review. Everything you said is exactly what my experience has been with Unblemish! I had the problem with cystic acne on my jaw line also. I reluctantly had another 2 month supply shipped this past week. I&#x27;m hoping my results will start to improve after this next round of treatment. I&#x27;m canceling after this regardless because I think it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products to clear my blemishes, this is the first product to work. I noticed results right away. After ten days, I was so convinced that this product was working like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried. I will be a life time buyer! I have never in my life lived my skin and now I do! I can&#x27;t stop staring at my skin either! I wish I could give this to my 14 year old self....</li>
    <li> Cleared my skin up in 2 weeks after months of out of control skin!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I would highly recommend it - I love my Rodan + Fields products....amazing results!!</li>
    <li> First, when I initially ordered, I received the wrong toner, and the seller was quick to replace the toner with the one I wanted! He was so nice about it and cared about my satisfaction. I was on cloud nine when I received the new toner in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been sing it for years and absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve tried TONS of different face washes for acne and this is the only one that controls the oil and gets rid of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++++++++ for both the seller and the product.</li>
    <li> Rodan + Fields products can only be sold by direct independent consultants. Not by companies. If you are ordering R+F products from a company, you are not guaranteed the quality product nor the 60 day money back guarantee you get directly from Rodan + Fields. If you are interested in the products, please contact an independent consultant to order.</li>
    <li> This is more than the normal pricing if you go through a consultant.  Not to mention a consultant can get you 10% off and free shipping.  You also have no way of knowing if these products are expired.</li>
    <li> I have always had acne, but lucky me I get cystic acne. I discovered this line around 2006 when it was sold at Nordstrom and was a fraction of the price.  I think the entire kit was under $50. I felt like I discovered a miracle cure for my face, because I went from having bad skin to being completely clear in a matter of weeks. When they pulled the line from retail and decided to sell via consultant I was bummed but whatever. I kept buying. Despite the product being practically the same, I stuck with it despite massive price jumps. Literally, one month I was paying $50, the next month $120, and so on. At the newest price of $170 (plus shipping) which started about 2 or so years go, I decided to try and find another product. I also never found a consultant so I was buying direct from the company, and they had an auto enrollment plan where they just sent you product. They company as a whole got into a bit if trouble for this as it was something they did to people without permission, wouldn&#x27;t cancel and wouldn&#x27;t take back product they just sent and billed for. Anyway although I loved the product, I got fed up with the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I have tried it all, from Lancôme to Clinique to Murad to Arbonne to Alba - I have wasted so much money trying to find a product similar at a lower pricepoint with crap results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago I looked in the mirror and realized how damaged my skin is since stopping R+F 2 years ago. I had light scaring, dark spots, and patches of pimples that would never go away. Add to it the fact that Im pushing 40, I realized I had to do something because I&#x27;m too young AND too old for my face to look like this.  I jumped on Amazon just to see if R+F was sold here so I could avoid the consultant/auto billing crap I had to deal with in the past. I am over the MOON this is sold here and it&#x27;s on PRIME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been back on the regime for a week and my pimples are gone. GONE. I had 3 pretty bad dark spots where I normally get cysts and they have not only faded so much I no longer need concealer to cover them up, the cysts under them are GONE.  My light scaring is also practically disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care if they kill puppies to make this stuff (they don&#x27;t!). It&#x27;s honestly a product that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips - you only need a tiny bit of each thing to get results. I use 1/2 of a pea size of the cleanser, one quick splash of the toner, one light pump of the gel and an equally tiny amount of the lotion. You don&#x27;t need gobs of the stuff at a time and doing so can possibly melt your face off. One kit will last me 4 or so months this way so although its expensive, you go thru it very slowly. Make sure you leave the cleanser on your face for a minute.lly get cysts and they have not only faded so much I no longer need concealer to cover them up, the cysts under them are GONE.

    <li> All of the items in the regimen I received were expired except for the sulfur wash cleanser. Lesson learned, only get these items from a consultant...not from amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased through a consultant, not here, but since I assume the product is the same, thought I&#x27;d review. I have been using the product religiously for five weeks. Not only have my issues not improved, if anything they are worse. I don&#x27;t have severe acne, just one or two breakouts going on all the time. Since using the product, I still have the same amounts of breakouts as always, but now also have a tremendous number of blackheads- nothing like I&#x27;ve ever experienced before. I&#x27;m going to use the rest of what I have because it was so crazy expensive, but after that I&#x27;m better off with whatever is on sale at Target.</li>
    <li> It was on time and perfect!  This line has seriously changed my life for the better!  I am 33 and finally I found something that stops my acne!!  bless</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with very mild acne since I was a teen, I used Proactiv for 10 yrs and it helped control it, but I recently quit it because I wanted to try something else, something that would even prevent the 2-3 cystic pimples I&#x27;d get once a month during &amp;#34;those days&amp;#34;. Posting on the Proactiv facebook page, an &amp;#34;Unblemish&amp;#34; consultant (hunting for victims) sent me a friend request. She started telling me all about the awesomeness of their products. Unblemish is made by Rodan &amp; Fields, the same creators of Proactiv (they sold the proactiv line and came up with this overpriced, supposedly amazing new formula), it costs 3 times more than Proactiv but they promise positive results or your money back. I was desperate to try something new and even though I didn&#x27;t want to pay $150 every two months I decided to give it a try (if they give me my money back there&#x27;s nothing to lose right?) but I still had high hopes and if it did work then I was willing to pay that every other month! Consultant insisted I&#x27;d wait AT LEAST 6-8 weeks to see results. 8 wks went by and my face, far from getting better, it got way WORSE. She INSISTED it&#x27;s the products &amp;#34;detoxing&amp;#34; my face and even though I was ready to return it, she somehow brainwashed me that I should try another 2 months with a different toner because the one toner I ordered gave me A GAZILLION blackheads, it was like every single pore was clogged, even in places where you can&#x27;t see my pores like my jaw line! (let me clarify this was never an issue before using these products and I even read other reviews on people complaining about Unblemish giving them blackheads...I wondered how they knew the products caused it. Well I am proof because I never had them before and I don&#x27;t have them now!) anyway, I fell for it and ordered another 2 month regimen; 3 and a half months (from the first use) my face got like this (first 4 pictures, of course). I am 33 yrs old, I had NEVER seen my face like that and it was NOT a coincidence that it started with these products. It made me depressed, self conscious, and embarrassed to even go out! I felt like that&#x27;s the only thing people would see when looking at me. Make up would make me look like a reptile!!! I ranted on an online forum and someone recommended &amp;#34;Nature&#x27;s Cure&amp;#34; (read my amazon review on that product) they are homeopathic over-the-counter pills that regulate your acne and hormonal/diet imbalances by working from the inside. Cystic pimples: NONE! Pores: reduced. Blackheads: gone! Now, my face isn&#x27;t perfect, I am wearing makeup (last pic) to cover the scars and pigmentation Unblemish left! But my face is acne clear and smooth!!! I am unhappy because I sent the Unblemish products back hoping they&#x27;d keep their &amp;#34;60-day money back guaranteed&amp;#34; promise. A MONTH went by, no refund. I sent them an email, no response. My consultant all of a sudden had no control over them. She also told me I should have used the products for AT LEAST 6 months...wait...REALLY?!?!?!!? I was already 300 dlls poorer I was not gonna risk my face getting worse! Yesterday I posted a really unhappy, public comment on their facebook page and that&#x27;s the only way I got them to contact me and give me my refund, but only for a 2-month regimen, basically the consultant tricked me into buying more and I lost my chance to return the first one too. I&#x27;m happy I discovered Nature&#x27;s Cure! I also got back to using Proactiv to keep it as part of my cleaning routine, so both as a combination work like a charm!!! If you&#x27;ve read &#x27;til here, thank you, if you&#x27;re struggling with hormonal or cystic acne, give the pills a try or look for something else!!! Unblemish does NOT work, I used it religiously as indicated; even while using it I never felt my face was completely clean. The Step 1 was like washing my face with a moisturizer lotion (no exfoliating beads, nothing) my consultant told me to leave it on for a couple of minutes, let it dry then rinse, nothing; none ofthe toners made a difference and I ran out of the step 3 way before the other steps! Also, even though I&#x27;m better off using Nature&#x27;s Cure, I still need to work on getting rid of the scars left by all this acne Unblemish left me with and they aren&#x27;t paying for that. I wish I had discovered the pills earlier and avoided all the stress and scarring Unblemish cause me. STAY AWAY.the toners made a difference and I ran out of the step 3 way before the other steps!

    <li> I hate to write this negative review. I&#x27;m not a picky shopper, nor am I one to judge a product too quickly. Please keep in mind that this was my experience, I&#x27;m sure others have had different/better experiences. I had mild acne to begin with, but thought it would be a shot to use this to finally get rid of it once and for all. I stuck with it for the recommended 8 weeks, even as my face was getting worse. It wasn&#x27;t that I had so many more pimples, but the fact that every pimple I did have was cystic acne and has left scars after a couple months. I&#x27;ve never had cystic acne before using this product. I had high hopes for this product, but have finished with a face that is much worse off than it was before I started</li>
    <li> I went on the actual Rodan and Fields website to look at this. It was 171 dollars. I came to amazon to see if they had it cheaper. On here it is like 250 dollars. Just watch out about over charging. Try the other website first.</li>
    <li> I love Rodan and Fields...however we are not supposed to be selling the products like this. First of all you don&#x27;t know if what you&#x27;re getting from this seller is in fact the actual product, even if it is the products you may receive from here could be expired! It&#x27;s much CHEAPER and SAFER if you buy from an actual consultant&#x27;s web site, plus you get a 60 day money back guarantee. If you really want to try these products let me help you out with cheaper prices and a guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Just to start off, I am not a consultant. I&#x27;ve been using Unblemish for a year now and It has literally changed my life. I am 30 and have struggled with cystic acne since I was 11 years old. I have tried every possible skincare line known to man and had pretty much given up when my boss told me about R&amp;F, so I figured what could I lose? Best decision I could&#x27;ve made.  I haven&#x27;t had one breakout and i feel like a new person.  Yes it is pricy (by the way you can buy this regimen on their website for  $40 dollars cheaper). But to me, clear skin is worth the money.</li>
    <li> All of these Rodan + Fields products on this site are over priced and do not come with a 60 day money back guarantee. Find a consultant and order through them. You will not get products auto shipped to you, YOU are in control of what gets shipped to you and what doesn&#x27;t. If you have products left over when your replenishment is ready after 60 days, YOU can have it shipped again or YOU can delay the order, or cancel the order. These products are amazing, but DO NOT purchase from here. They are charging more than it would cost you through a consultant. If you do not believe me go to elizabethpatrick.myrandf.com and click &amp;#34;shop now&amp;#34; and compare the prices!!!</li>
    <li> it made my skin really flaky and red with sores. I ended up going to a professional demotologist and paying a total of 480, for cremes, to correct my face.</li>
