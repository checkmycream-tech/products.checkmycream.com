<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> If you want a cold burn - this stuff is for you.</li>
    <li> I just tried this for the first time this morning.  Man, it is great.  One thing I did was I added it to my C.O. Bigelow shaving cream (from Bath &amp; Body Works) and it lathered up much better than without it.  The cream felt a bit cooler.  After the second pass, I did a cold water splash, then I slapped some Osage Rub in and wow, what a feeling.  First a slight burn, but the freeze came after that and it was wonderful.  I look forward to using this product for many years.  Only regret has been that I didn&#x27;t know of this product when I was younger.  Check it out!</li>
    <li> This bottle beats all other brand name after shave balms/lotions I own by far.  Use it after a shave.  The cool, refreshing sensation will rock ya.  I know it has for me.  Love the scent also.  Doesn&#x27;t last long, but reminds you of those old barber shop feel.  Highly recommended!      K6</li>
    <li> I use this menthol tonic liberally as a body splash on my chest after showering.  Aromatic and pleasing smell.</li>
    <li> There is so much menthol in this product that it is almost unusable. The menthol was so overwhelming that it took 15 minutes for it to feel like it wasn&#x27;t in my eyes. Anyone considering this product should look elsewhere</li>
    <li> If you are a sweaty guy like my jock husband, this is the stuff for you. Slap it on and instant cold.</li>
    <li> It cools your skin very effectively. The scent is old school.... well.... cheap old school that is.&lt;br /&gt;For my smeller (and the management&#x27;s) it is too much of a reminder of Listerine, but the dental smell wears off quickly and the price is low enough to give it a try.</li>
    <li> My barber tried this product on my itchy head and it worked wonders so I had to order it.  The supplier got it to me in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I use it as an aftershave, and it&#x27;s great. It has a burning sensation initially, then fads to icy cold and stays cold for several minutes. It definitely has an \\&quot;old man\\&quot; smell to it, but in a good way. Very pleasant.    My only criticism is the price of shipping. Shipping costs more than the item. But I gave it 5 stars anyway, Postal workers can&#x27;t work for free.</li>
    <li> I love that fresh barbered smell</li>
    <li> I used  this product for the 1st time today following a head and face shave.  After applying I found I busted out in laughter and all I could say was wow!  This was one of the most intense sensation I have ever experienced and made me think of that peppermint patty commercial from the 70&#x27;s (Get the sensation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This old school product is simply wonderful! So good I thought about shaving a few times today so I could get that wonderful feeling agin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a pro barber use this and I guarantee your tips will double! It is that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice clean sent that to me is not overpowering and just a bit milder than say Clubman aftershave. I see it does have alcohol in it but I can feel a bit of oil on my face as well so I think it will give me the perfect mix of soothing and cool bite that I have been searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to DE shaving and I am trying lots of products from Pinaud and others but so far this one is my favorite. I may use something a bit more classy if I am going out for an evening but this just became my everyday aftershave that will be on my face every morning! Get the sensation!&lt;br /&gt;What a way to start the day! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers said, you&#x27;ll either love this or hate it.  It isn&#x27;t really&amp;#34;after save&amp;#34; ie stuff you put on to smell good. It smells sort of medicinal but the smell dissipates quickly. The menthol is outrageous.  If it&#x27;s therapeutic aftershave or skin treatment you need this is something you can try. It will sooth/cool  your face and the menthol is invigorating. I had something in my eye. Very troubling. Thought it might have been more serious than just a speck in my eye. I used this stuff after shaving one day and the menthol made my eyes water profusely. It flushed out whatever that thing in my eye was!</li>
    <li> love it, no razor bumps when i shave my noggin</li>
    <li> Gotta find lustray menthol</li>
    <li> Love it.  Great aftershave.  Eucalyptus, alcohol, and menthol combo is great.  Feels good, keep my skin from getting red after shaving, and smell is nice.  Someone describe the fragrance as a classic barber shop smell and that is probably a good description.</li>
    <li> Reminds me a lot of skin bracer only better.&lt;br /&gt;Cools and refreshes. Love the tingly fee.  Get some!</li>
    <li> An occasional summer aftershave experience for me, this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that delivers more of a menthol punch in the face freshness than Proraso&#x27;s aftershave splash. It also takes me back to the old day barbershops I remember as a kid... I remember a place putting some in my hair and giving me that tingling feeling in the scalp after a haircut.</li>
    <li> This stuff definately does what it&#x27;s meant to. I rub a little on my kneck and the back of my head on those summer days where despite air conditioning you can&#x27;t seem to stop perspiring. The menthol is definately cooling and stimulates the skin. Mixed with a couple of other classic barbershop products on a tray(like clubman talc) it gives your bathroom a distictly masculine old school look, like in a classy bathroom with an attendant and all that.</li>
    <li> Great to use in the spring and summer months only</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  I use it on my head and massage it in after I cut my hair.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is just me or the Osage Rub, but after I use this my scalp feels very refreshed.  I also use it on a few friends that come to me for their cuts and they really like it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong, try it you&#x27;ll like it :)  thanks Rok</li>
    <li> Osage Rub is one of my favorite aftershaves. It&#x27;s loaded with menthol and eucalyptus and smells great. It&#x27;s very cooling. It will make your eyes water and your nose run (this sensation dies off quickly). Very bracing. If you like a menthol rush, look no further. This stuff has been around forever, it&#x27;s an old barbershop standby and is a great summer aftershave. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I find this product to be really great.  Not only is it a great face and head splash, it also brings back the fond memories and smells of the old time babershops.  I highly recommend Osage Rub.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mentholated blast and leaves my skin feeling just right....the scent is not too powerful but the tingle is great...</li>
    <li> Brisk-Refreshing.  Barber shop smell. Just a great scent for the man who likes menthol.  Seller Smallflower was fast and professional. Highly recommend. Large 14oz bottle is a real bonus.</li>
    <li> this is good stuff - for the life of me, i don&#x27;t know why this (and other) offering isn&#x27;t for sale nationwide - but as most modern shavers &#x27;in the know&#x27; know, Osage Rub can be mixed with other aftershaves to make some incredibly nice &#x27;bootleg&#x27; fragrances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get it, use it, love it!</li>
    <li> Essential aftershave for an old school shaver.  I used a double edge safety razor for my shaves.  Osage Rub is a very good aftershave with better than average cooling properties.  It&#x27;s not quite as cold as some of the reviews I read before purchasing it - however it is a bit &amp;#34;colder&amp;#34; than Aqua Velva Ice Blue - good stuff.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m 41 with a wife and kids...but I&#x27;m a studly military officer that has to fight the ladies off, and this inexpensive aftershave not only works, but it drives the ladies nuts!</li>
    <li> I had never used anything like this before but really like it.  It is refreshing to splash on in the middle of a hot day or after a long day at work if I am going out and don&#x27;t have time for a shower.  A little on the back of the neck or rub some through your hair.  JUST DON&amp;#34;T GET IT IN YOUR EYES...YIKES!</li>
    <li> Osage Rub is probably the most refreshing,enlivening, \\&quot;wake-me-up\\&quot; splash-on or after shave you can buy and, for the amount, the price is really great! I can remember having the barber use it on my head when I was a little kid and it was a great feeling.  Nearly 40 years later, I asked my local barber about it and he said he could get it for me, which he did.  I actually look forward to the morning shave and the great feeling that Osage Rub gives me.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF REALLY PACKS A PUNCH...GIVES YOU A JOLT AFTER YOUR SHAVE IN THE MORNING OR WHENEVER...BUT BE CAREFUL...I USE IT SEVERAL TIMES A DAY.  PRICE WAS GREAT AND THE SHIPPING WAS FAST. CAREFUL YOU DO NOT GET IT TO CLOSE TO YOUR EYES.  ITS REFRESHING IN EVERY WAY...TRY IT..THE COST IS CHEAP..THE RESULTS ARE ONE OF A KIND..</li>
    <li> Love the brisk feeling and scent. Reminds me of skin bracer. Good stuff</li>
    <li> This drink tastes weird. Also, the product name says Osage which made me think it would be orange. Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> COOL, and refreshing! Excellent paired with neutral fragrant soaps.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! You can&#x27;t go wrong with Osage Rub. Very invigorating for face and head. VERY cool menthol feel. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have used this stuff since high school. It is very bracing but once it is dried has very little smell to it, the lack of a strong, over powering smell is one reason I like it. The cooling effect is pretty strong but you can actually cut if with a little bit of water if you want to tone it down a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with Jeri&#x27;s Osage Rub.  I am taken back some 60+ years to Lou&#x27;s Barbershop in Provo every time I use it..I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the same brand Lou used, but the effect and fragrance are very familiar.  Like the say,  &amp;#34;try it, you&#x27;ll like it&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> What has this stuff been all my life?  Osage Rub is pure magic, at least if you really like menthol.  After a nice shave, splash some of this on your face and brace yourself--the menthol level is crazy high, and the cool will last at least 30 minutes.  The eucalyptus seems to not only cool your face, but it also tones and moisturizes.  The scent is mostly the mint and menthol--very medicinal is that old school barbershop kind of way.  You can easily splash on another aftershave or cologne after this dries down with no problem at all.  As if all that wasn&#x27;t enough, this 14 oz bottle is dirt cheap.  Osage Rub is awesome!</li>
    <li> Now here&#x27;s a smack in the kisser! I like methol aftershaves. I don&#x27;t find it overpowering in effect or fragrance. Reminds me of my younger days and visits to the barbershops of my youth. Not only is it nice after a shave, I like it after a shower, or anytime after I wash my face. Makes this old man feel a bit younger.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product to apply as an after shave.  Invigorating and wakes you up.  I follow up with a moisturizing after shave.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Has a slow burn at first then it goes straight to ice and stays cold a long, long time. I can&#x27;t wait to use this in the winter time when the temperature is in the single digits with wind chill. The fumes that come off this stuff will burn and sting your eyes and make them water. You get all this awesomeness plus it smells like Halls cough drops, whats not to like!</li>
    <li> Wow! If you are looking to kickstart your morning and blast into your day at full afterburner, the only thing more intense than this might be a hit of crack. Seriously, Osage Rub has incredible an incredible cooling sensation that radiates throughout your skin for close to 30 minutes after use, depending on the amount you apply. For a hot summer day, you cannot beat this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge fan of Skin Bracer, which is currently my favorite aftershave. I&#x27;m also a fan of Clubman Pinaud and their Lime Sec, but I always feel like something is missing when I use an AS without Menthol in it. Osage Rub always satisfies my menthol fix! I slightly prefer the smell of the original Clubman Pinaud and Skin Bracer, but the mint of the Osage Rub is refreshing and vibrant. I can effectively compare it to Listerine.</li>
    <li> My barber uses this stuff after a shave and I love it.  I have been using this for a year now, my favorite aftershave.</li>
    <li> Wish it had alcohol as the primary ingredient instead of water. Still does a decent job as a aftershave</li>
    <li> Very cooling to the skin but drying as well which is the downside of using it  too much. Effective against bug bites though!</li>
    <li> This product is like miracle whip. You either like it or you don&#x27;t. While I enjoy the scent and the feeling it has on the skin. I am not sure what the main use of this is. Maybe a generational thing. You could use this as after shave but using on my hair doesn&#x27;t do anything. I like it, not sure though I would buy it again. On the plus side though you do get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> Yes. My husband loves this stuff and it makes his face feel super soft &amp; smooth! It is warming, but if you can handle it for a second...!</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. I get really bad razor burn, and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that makes it go away. STRONG STUFF, but I love it. Not your standard aftershave. Discovered it years ago when I started going to a barber shop and they used it on me. Never have been able to find it in a local store in my area. Have always had to order it off various websites, paying tons of shipping. Glad to see it&#x27;s on Amazon now at a good price.</li>
    <li> Like getting a money shot from Mr. Freeze and Subzero simultaneously. Used to use Skinbracer, threw that crap away, this is the business.</li>
    <li> When I was a kid, my barber used this and I like the invigorating feeling.  And now it is a plastic bottle so it is safer if you drop it.  Yeah it is a strong menthol smell a little like Bengay, but that aroma dissipates fast.  I love it and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Just started wet-shaving with a double edge razor after 20 years of using electric. Been reading up on the shave forums and this Osage Rub was highly regarded and popular if you&#x27;re into that freeze-your-face off feeling. I had to try it, but couldn&#x27;t find anyplace around Houston that carried it, so ended up ordering off Amazon. I love the clean tingling feeling. I&#x27;m actually waiting on my Aqua Velva Ice Sport aftershave that I also ordered off Amazon so I can mix the two and use it as my aftershave (a recommended concoction to make it smell better yet still get that menthol blast).  I put this into a mini spray bottle to make it easier to use rather than dumping a bunch onto your hands which I would recommend.  I actually got the spray bottles off Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000NJHNLW Fantasea Fine Mist Spray Bottle 2.5 oz. (Pack of 12)]]</li>
    <li> I tried putting this on my face out of the box, expecting an immediate cool blast. Not sure what I was thinking, but that didn&#x27;t work. Then I tried putting this on after actually shaving. Jeris Osage definitely changes, if not improves, your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I&#x27;m transitioning from all of the overpriced Gillette products. Got tired of paying so much for mediocrity. Yes, Gillette is mediocre, even if they get every single NFL/NBA/MLB/professional sports player in existence to put in a good word for them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that are wanting to improve your shave, switch to a shave brush, shave soap, and one of these kinds of aftershaves. If you&#x27;re worried about moisturizing, then get lotion. If you&#x27;re looking for a razor, just start somewhere that looks good for you. Also, a hot towel/washcloth does wonders during a shave.</li>
    <li> I use Clubman aftershaves and like them, so I thought I would give this Osage Rub a try.  There is no question this is invigorating and makes your face feel cool and tingly when you apply it.  The sensation lasts for several minutes and feels really good on a hot day.  The smell, however, is quite strong.  It smells like a combination of Listerine and Vick&#x27;s Vapo-Rub.  Thankfully, the smell fades fairly quickly, so you can apply an aftershave or cologne for a more pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Glad to find this, as it is a favorite of my husbands.</li>
    <li> Good barbershop scent with a great chill feeling after a shower in the summer time. You can fling this stuff everywhere, as it is not over powering and feels cool when it is hot outside.</li>
    <li> My barber used this product when I went in to get my haircut. I asked him what it was because it felt really nice and made my head feel nice and cool when it was really hot outside. I bought this stuff and it works great. I use it for a few different things, I mix it with my aftershave lotion for a nice cooling energizing feeling and I also apply some to my head and neck on hot days and it feels nice and keeps you cool feeling for a little bit.</li>
    <li> Your skin feels tight and smooth when you use this as an aftershave. But it BURNS. It burns right up to the point where it is just about unbearable.. Then subsides. I do find myself continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> Trying to capture the scent of an Old Time Barber Shop and came across this product. I read the reviews and it seemed to fit. The product came today and I applied some. All I could think of was &amp;#34;Ben Gay.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure for those who want the &amp;#34;Ben Gay&amp;#34; scent this is a great product. I have no reason to think the product is not otherwise outstanding but for me, there is no getting past the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still looking.</li>
    <li> Was looking for some aftershave alternative found this product and probably not ever buy another aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;On my first use i instantly remembered when i used to go to the barber, the smell of the barbers aftershave liquid being splashed on your face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the same smell. It&#x27;s the same alcohol based,cool mint that soothes your freshly shaved skin.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every Penny!</li>
    <li> This stuff will zap your life into overdrive and make you conquer everything. It bitch slaps you and wakes you up, gets your butt back on the field and feeling like a winner again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need for pep talks or soft, soothey things- it&#x27;s got:&lt;br /&gt;- alcohol (cleans yer skin)&lt;br /&gt;- menthol (bitch slaps the face off yer face and tells you to stop playing like a ninny)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hungover? ZAP! Need post-shave facial relief? ZAP! Forget that your meeting is at 8:00, not 8:30-- and still have sex in your hair, and god you&#x27;d do anything to make that smell go away? ZAP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it, slap it, zap it, own it, love it, profit, repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Also beneficial for non-drinkers and other responsible folks.</li>
    <li> I like menthol based aftershaves, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the scent. It smelled cheap and unrefined. It does have a lot of menthol in it, but I prefer proraso.</li>
    <li> A classic aftershave splash.  I remember the first time I used it and the intense cooling/menthol sensation.  It&#x27;s interesting how overtime you become adjusted or accustomed.  This is a great splash, the scent goes away quickly and leaves your face feeling wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something with a lingering scent, you&#x27;ll need to look somewhere else.  This is perfect as an astringent and to cool your face (and head for us bald guys).  I&#x27;ll use this after the final rinse after a third pass with the safety razor just before an aftershave or witchhazel blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, effective, and the bottle lasts for a while - you&#x27;d don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!!! It&#x27;s great after a shower and shave. It does smell like Ben gay but that doesn&#x27;t last long. Love the cool feeling you get when you put it on your scalp. I am going to buy this again.</li>
    <li> When I was in central Texas, I&#x27;d occasionally go into my local barber shop for a shave.  They used heated foam and a straight razor blade for shaves.  After the shave, they would splash this stuff in their hands and dab it on my face.  It left a very pleasant, cooling sensation.  I asked my barber what it was and where to find it.  I picked up a bottle and it lasted me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because there is no alcohol, it doesn&#x27;t burn which is a definite plus.  I also find that it helps tremendously with irritation and razor burn.  I am now a wet shaver and I exclusively use DE blades and a safety razor.  I always use this as my aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some reviews talk about the smell, etc.  I don&#x27;t find the smell to be overwhelming at all.  After an hour or so, I don&#x27;t even notice it there anymore.  Even so, I don&#x27;t find the smell to be unpleasant or perfumey.  Everyone&#x27;s sense of smell is different so your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend picking some up if you&#x27;re considering it.  It&#x27;s only $10 and a full bottle will last months.</li>
    <li> I got this when I first started wet shaving.  It is a must have.  Smells great and you get one heck of a burn.  Very refreshing but the smell good away so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with your regular cologne.</li>
    <li> The alcohol in it provides the burn and the menthol and eucalyptus helps cool and sooth.  Not an extreme burn unless I&#x27;ve cut myself.  Very refreshing.  Scent wears out fairly quick so that it won&#x27;t mess with the scent of your cologne/aftershave.</li>
    <li> Put this stuff on my face and scalp right out of the shower. Leaves you feeling refreshed and cool, very reminiscent of when I would go to the Barber.</li>
    <li> Describing this fantastic juice as just &amp;#34;brisk&amp;#34; is an understatement...it should be branded as &amp;#34;frigid&amp;#34; because the real fun starts after you finally work up the guts to splash some of this icy liquid on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts off as &amp;#34;minty pleasant&amp;#34; albeit a bit&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34;...but that&#x27;s short-lived because...brace yourself here, seriously...it then bitch-slaps you with&lt;br /&gt;a pungent peppery punch of menthol and eucalyptus on the cheeks, forehead and temples, whilst sharp&lt;br /&gt;vapors waft decisively into the nostrils and swirls with an unrelenting potency around the eyes as&lt;br /&gt;additional reminders of what you&#x27;re dealing with&lt;br /&gt;here. At the same time, the Clubman Jeris Osage Rub generates an intense &amp;#34;hot/cold&amp;#34; sensation on the skin but then mellows after a few minutes into a&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;tingly cool&amp;#34; sensation that carries on for a little while longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clubman Jeris Osage Rub fragrance reminds me of the &amp;#34;old school scents&amp;#34; of yesteryear...Skin Bracer by Mennen is one that immediately comes to mind along with Pacific Rush After Shave by Barbasol however the Clubman Jeris Osage Rub contains MUCH MORE MENTHOL in its composition and scent therefore should not be trifled with...it means serious business...its the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s packaged in a 14oz vintage barber shop style plastic bottle adorned with a plain, straightforward and informative label that acutely projects a sanguinity of what lies inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this fine elixir evokes a bit of nostalgia in a vintage product formula that&#x27;s perfect for today&#x27;s man.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It is great for after a shave. It is cooling and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave, especially on hot days.</li>
    <li> Talk about a slap in the face. I love the feeling of menthol and eucalyptus!! This is a GREAT product, leaves a cool, fresh feeling on the face after shaving. Very affordable and very refreshing on those hot days.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff the barber rubbed on your head when you were young. Works great as an aftershave or hear tonic.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t smell weak... too strong. because of smell I had to stop using it after two trials. I like the effect but smell is too medicine like</li>
    <li> This will definitely wake you up, but in a good way.  Great clean smell and soothing sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stronger and better than many other pricier brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will let you know where you have over-worked your shave.</li>
    <li> I love osage rub.  What a treat each time I shave or in my hair after a shower.  I wish they had it in drug stores instead of garbage like Axe</li>
    <li> Cooling, refreshing and smells great!  Will definitely get second bottle as the 1st bottle is half empty!  Use it on a hot and humid day after a cooling shower.</li>
    <li> I use it as an aftershave or a wake up.  It is a menthol blast that starts slow and keeps going and going.  I have not used it on my scalp.  This is not something you want to use on any sensitive areas.  It does help with razor burn.  Great value with the price and amount you get.&lt;br /&gt;Note- it scent is not something that lasts very long.</li>
    <li> I love this product . Nice finishing touch to a shave !!!</li>
    <li> Nice menthol scent in cool retro &amp;#34;barbershop&amp;#34; bottle.</li>
    <li> Refreshing, tingly goodness that every barber needs.&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of choices out there and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch but this is the one that client&#x27;s love and the one that I always go back to.&lt;br /&gt;Experiment with others for fun but Osage Rub is the tried and true barbering classic.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Admittedly, the scent may not appeal to all - sort of a menthol/eucalyptus blend - but the scent fades quickly. What I love, both after shaving and on my scalp, is the amazing cooling feeling. After the initial effect of almost overkill, the cooling sensations lasts for at least an hour. That is what I really love. And, you surely can not beat the price!!</li>
    <li> I am using Clubman Jeris Osage Rub as an after shave, it has a nice cool feel and scent, and very reasonable price for its quality. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Good refreshing aftershave. No astringents, but plenty of menthol!</li>
    <li> Good rub, with expected invigoration. Nice smell if you care for a light menthol type scent, smell doesn&#x27;t last long though. It has meet my expectation for a Clubman product. I will continue to rotate this rub into my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I picked this up as a tonic and aftershave to use rather than Clubman.  I love Clubman but sometimes it burns a little too much.  I love this stuff but I will say that I will probably only use it as a hair tonic in the summertime as it really is super-cooling!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I had heard of this for a while and wanted to try some. I went to a local barber for a straight shave and he Used the Osage Rub and it was wonderful.  I ordered it for myself and I alternate it with Proraso. I love my OSAGE RUB!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really my go to product for smelling good..it&#x27;s menthol. But if you want something they will cool you down in the summer then this stuff to have. Rub on face and chest and it feels like a block of ice up against your skin</li>
    <li> I like the clubman aftershave.  I have the clubman/pinaud and the bay rum.  I like them both... and I wanted something for summer to use for it&#x27;s cooling effect this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days now as an aftershave and Hair/scalp tonic.  It really makes my hair soft and stimulates the scalp.  It does not give my hair styling manageability.  I was hoping it would, but I like it as aftershave.  It&#x27;s Old Timey. scent reminds me of my Grandfather not my Dad.  My Dad is an old spice or Bruit aftershave man.  I don&#x27;t like either of those scents but this I like.  At first whiff strait from the bottle, it is kind of like vicks but the menthol, Eucalyptus scent dissipated rather quickly after applying it.  After a few minutes it leaves only a very light &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; scent.  It is quite pleasant to use as an aftershave.  Powerful and chillingly cool with the menthol.  I found my summer aftershave!</li>
    <li> Feels great on the skin, but understand this, friends.  It should not be applied to your balls unless you&#x27;re tough enough to take the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me on that one.</li>
    <li> Manly smell, not too strong, very refreshing will definitely buy again.  I really enjoy the &amp;#34;old time&amp;#34; barbershop smell and feeling this provides.</li>
    <li> Try it with proraso green label shaving cream! Nice addition to a summer shave.  Also great head splash. Doesn&#x27;t last long and not overpowering</li>
    <li> Winter is coming. Talk about face freeze. It defiantly leaves you feeling refreshed and tingly. As far as soothing, not so much. I have good results rubbing my face with alum and then using the osage rub. For what it is, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Amazingly cold stuff! Great for the summer months. It makes a great splash on aftershave, or you can add it to a warm bath for an interesting experience. Not much of  a scent, and what&#x27;s there doesn&#x27;t linger. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Osage.</li>
    <li> If you want an aftershave loaded with menthol, this is the best stuff. If you don&#x27;t want that or don&#x27;t know what menthol is, it&#x27;s probably not for you.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. I want it for myself so I wont rate it 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> Yup, it sure does have a bite. I like it a lot but was not my favorite mixer with whiskey :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I am a huge fan of menthol products, and this fits the bill nicely. I&#x27;ve used it a few times, and here is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I don&#x27;t care for it as an aftershave. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the cooling feeling is soooooo right, but I like other Clubman aftershaves better because this stuff leaves my face feeling a little dry and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This has a lot of menthol in it, but it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water - and I put lots of it allll over my face after a shower and shave. Your experience may vary though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I used this on \\&quot;the boys.\\&quot; Very mild, nice bracing cool feeling - even better than extra strength Gold Bond lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* After a shower, this is great to rub through your scalp. No drying or tightening, keeps you nice and cool! I don&#x27;t have crazy oily hair OR very dry hair, so again - you may have a different experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you make a decision to purchase this, Amazon has the best price for sure. I got it for $8.00 as an add-on, and it&#x27;s already above $10.00 again! Keep an eye on the price, get this at a steal if you can :)</li>
    <li> Purchased this aftershave to help &amp;#34;cool off&amp;#34; during the summer months.  If you like a nice sharp bite after shaving, try this!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. If you were not awake when you started your shave you will be when you finish with this!  Slight burn for the first 5 seconds then your face cools and stays that way for a good 20-30 minutes. Excellent way to start the day.</li>
    <li> My first experience with Osage Rub was in 1968 in a barbershop on The Square.  My barber, Dwight, splashed it on my head halfway through cleaning up my flattop before starting 2nd grade.  Dwight and my father belly laughed at me rubbing my head when Dwight perfected that flat cut at the cowlick on the left side of my head.  I&#x27;ve been getting a dousing of Osage Rub with every hair cut since at the same barbershop.  I even bought a few bottles through the years and splashed my daughter&#x27;s head after a good bath; they still talk about that &#x27;green stuff&#x27; you put on your head.    You gotta like menthol and able to tolerate a full on opening of your scalp and head.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> woe is me,  this stuff smells just like thought it would,.not bad but it is what it is .not overly</li>
    <li> I went to a different barber shop then I normally do for a cut.  It was hot outside and I was a little overheated.  The guy cutting my hair said \\&quot;I got something to cool you down after your cut\\&quot;.  When he was done cutting, he grabbed this bottle with green liquid in it.  He poured some into his hand and messaged it into my hair and scalp and...  OH BOY!! WOW!! It cooled me down like right now. I had to get a bottle of it.  The stuff is fantastic. Osage Rub is worth every penny.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Was a little concerned going in. Buying without knowing the scent is aways dicey. Knew it to be very chilling but has a surprisingly nice but not too strong scent that lingers for a while, too. Great for the summer heat.</li>
    <li> First off I agree that the smell is a bit medicinal and does smell a bit like Ben Gay.  That being said, the cooling sensation you get from this is fantastic.  Between the heavy dose of menthol and eculpytus you will get a one two punch.  This thing is a real skin bracer too.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the smell wasn&#x27;t so medicinal but since it fades quickly I can live with it.  I like aqua velva as well but I think this product has even MORE menthol than AV.  So if you are really into menthol check this out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty cool (pun intended) but don&#x27;t spend 12 dollars on it. It is just menthol and some other flavor stuff. Also, you may not like the strong smell.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, best aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used. For sure worth the money!</li>
    <li> Bottom line up front. The feeling is great, this product has a very noticeable refreshing sensation when applied. The scent is very subtle and will not affect if you are wearing cologne or any other scent.</li>
    <li> It does the job as advertised. Nothing overwhelmingly great. Can burn the eyes a bit from the fumes (even if you don&#x27;t use it around the eyes). The smell is cheap, but reminiscent of an old school barber&#x27;s shop. Although, it feels great on the skin or scalp, the cheap smell is one reason I use it infrequently.</li>
    <li> What a great smell. Reminds me of barbershops. This is something you can put on anytime, not just after you shave. I love the smell. Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is the real deal, old school stuff that Grandpa used. I LOVE the bracing jolt you get with Osage after a nice wet shave with a straight razor and some amazing cream or soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started wet shaving about a year ago and have NEVER looked back. I decided to finally try Osage a few months ago and damn am I ever happy I did. Since a little goes a long way this bottle will last even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is strong and somewhat &amp;#34;bitter&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t last long... Say 5 minutes or so? But the burn? Ohhh that good burn last for awhile...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not a fan of that bracing burn after a shave, please stay away from Osage.</li>
    <li> Tried it a little bit but suspect it&#x27;s going to work real well once the weather heats up...like in about seven months from now. Smells good; not foo-foo.</li>
    <li> Order was as expected</li>
    <li> Seriously super Antarctic cool menthol. Smells similar to Gold Bond powder, very minty. I initially bought it after reading reviews of it as a hair tonic and then started using it as an after shave. It&#x27;s smooth, leaves the skin tingling, and is very cooling, but be careful around the eyes or you&#x27;ll end up with a searing sting and eyes redder than Snoop Dogg&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Good, not a strong as I was expecting but there is a  heating cooling on the face.</li>
    <li> Feels absolutely great post shave. Really has a good clean burn to it, and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> While it is twice the price on Amazon versus a retail store, the limited ability of most people to locally get this product makes the price still worth paying for the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a menthol and eucalyptus junkie who loves that cool feeling after or during shaving, this is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add this instead of water when mixing shaving soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use afterwards for intense coolness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also add menthol crystals to this and increase the already intense feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must for anyone who finds the menthol sensation of proraso , etc lacking.</li>
    <li> I Bought this for about five bucks at Merz Apothecary in Chicago. Merz is the brick-and-mortar store for Smallflower. Love it. You get that expected Clubman sting and then your face freezes and cools so nicely. Really takes the razor burn out...and I mean right now! A very pleasant and unexpected benefit was the smoothness of the skin afterwards. This stuff really does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this rub has a very strong menthol/eucalyptus scent when first applied. This fades quickly. I have no problem with it conflicting with my cologne. It takes about 10 minutes for the scent to dissipate. Be forewarned though that the initial blast is quite a WOW. I like it but for those who prefer a more gradual wake up in the morning, pass on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My barber puts this in a spray bottle and finishes my haircut with a generous application. I liked it so much I asked him what it was. I also put it in a spray bottle and spray and massage into my hair when I get home from work feeling tired (or stressed) or right before I go to bed. I just find it very pleasant and calming. A lot of reviewers commented on the menthol, but the eucalyptus also shines through nicely. Honestly, I like Aqua Velva as an aftershave but as a change of pace I use this. However, don&#x27;t be running right out into cold winter weather as I did chasing the garbage man --- as it felt like menthol/eucalyptus intensity kicked up to a new level on my face! Honestly, will keep this in stock for regular use.</li>
    <li> If you need to wake up.  This is the stuff.  If you want to feel alive, this is the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it often, but when I need to kick the days ass, I use this.</li>
    <li> Nothing cools better than this.  it&#x27;s the ultimate blast of cool.  Nothing comes close.  this stuff is awesome.  I&#x27;ll have a bottle of this around for the rest of my days.</li>
    <li> Great product with a classic smell.</li>
    <li> This aftershave offers a very invigorating and refreshing alternative.  I was looking for powerful aftershave; Osage fits the bill.  Be prepared.  Not for the fainthearted.  I think it could be added to any man&#x27;s arsenal, but apply gingerly until you become comfortable with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for hot weather. huge menthol kick! and smells similar to proraso shaving soap, which i really like.</li>
    <li> Yo-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this stuff.  Gives a very refreshing finish to every shave.  Recommend A++++</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re into menthol, this is the aftershave for you.  Wow.  It will wake you up in the morning and feels great.  It&#x27;s a stinger, so if you dislike that you&#x27;ll want to avoid Osage.  Others have said it&#x27;s too much of an Old Man smell or too medicinal but I disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was almost as much as the product from Smallflower.  As it turns out I live near Merz Apothecary (the bricks and mortar store for Smallflower) and will visit the store in the future.</li>
    <li> I have tried some of the better brands out there like Truefitt and Hill, and although they&#x27;re great. I can&#x27;t stop using Osage. It has so much menthol that it makes you feel like you got a real shave, especially while wet shaving. Also, its fun to not be able to feel your face for a few minutes, especially if a breeze kicks up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit is you can feel where your skills were lacking, with extra burning sensation where you had more abrasions. Plus it&#x27;s cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it came in a glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now of course this is a splash, with alcohol, so it can dry out your face more and doesn&#x27;t have too many medicinal properties but the reality is we probably don&#x27;t need that mumbo jumbo anyways.</li>
    <li> I have many of the famous splashes but this one is different. Very minty and smells like bengay. It&#x27;s so strong that it will make your eyes water a bit. The feeling though IS AMAZING! I&#x27;m just not a big fan of the strong mint.</li>
    <li> Do you want a cool feel on your body when it is hot?  Try the Osage Rub.  I read elsewhere that&lt;br /&gt;OS Rub is a nice touch and I would agree.  This size was right at the time and I would rebuy it.</li>
    <li> This stuff turns you into Iceman. It instantly cools your face (and hands!) with menthol and Eucalyptus and a little alcohol. Scent fades in a few minutes but your face feels great. And it is by Clubman, so you know it&#x27;s good. So gents, after a nice double edge shave or a cut throat reach for the coolness that can only be found in Osage Rub. The only aftershave that will make you moonwalk and dance like an Egyptian.</li>
    <li> strong barber shop quality back in the day stuff!!!!! smooth clubman  fragrance !!!! another  one for the great line of clubman products...</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading several very positive reviews and thought I might like it as well.  Its ok.  I like the menthal it has in it.  It will help wake you up, but the scent might not be my favorite.  Maybe more of an older person? I have a big bottle of it so I guess I&#x27;ll have to get used to it.</li>
    <li> This is fine stuff, but only buy form this seller if you feel like paying double the going rate for the slowest shipping in the world.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and thought and giving it a try.  After splashing some in my hair and face it felt super cool and refreshing.  I really enjoy that menthol feel.  It smells like I just left the barber shop.  I&#x27;m disappointed that my local Barbara Beauty Supply doesn&#x27;t carry it.  Great Stuff!</li>
    <li> I do love this stuff.  It will remind you of that fresh tingly feeling you get at the barber shop</li>
    <li> This stuff will really wake you up in the morning! Yeah, the menthol stings your eyes for a minute or two but it works better than coffee for waking you up.</li>
    <li> U really have to like menthyol ... Nice feeing ... Not so nice smell. With that said I enjoy it but it may not be for everyone.as always Amazon delivered on time and product as described .</li>
    <li> I ordered the rub despite what seemed to be cautionary remarks from some who found it too &amp;#34;bracing&amp;#34;.  I love it as a splash of aftershave; the menthol scent is great and not at all cloying or sweet.  Yes, there&#x27;s a bit of &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34;, but nothing more than any other true aftershave.  And... I have not had to buy or use a dandruff shampoo since finding the rub.  I apply it once or twice a week, right before I take a shower, and my scalp is in great shape.</li>
    <li> I first encountered this Osage Rub as a youth getting my hair cut by a (very old) gentleman barber in downtown Bend, Oregon. Having cut my hair, out came the straight razor, which was stropped, and then the back of my neck was shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER that he applied the Osage Rub.  Fantastic.  You really knew you&#x27;d had a hair cut then.  The menthol fire almost makes your hair stand on end.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I splash this all over after shaving my chrome dome, . You get the fire/ice feel - fire of the alcohol hitting your skin followed by the cool ice of the menthol. The smell is perfect for a fresh start to your day!</li>
    <li> YEEEEEHAWWW is what you will say after a splash of this, this will wake you up after a morning shave, the smell in the bottle is very strong but on the skin it calms down, made my skin feel very soft, great old school scent just like walking out of the barbershop with my pap and dad when i was little. this is by far my favorite so far next to my bay rum,</li>
    <li> This product has basically cured my chronic razor burn on my neck. My barber uses this on my scalp, around the back of my neck, and behind my ears after a straight blade shave. This stuff is great. Fair warning, it only takes a few drops in your palm to cover your whole face after a shave. Highly recommended. I&#x27;ve been told by many old timers that I have shared this with that it smells just like the old days in barbershops. One even told me that the bottle looks the same, but just plastic now instead of glass.</li>
    <li> This makes your face tingle! Very clean and fresh smell without the burn! The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long, so no worries about fragrance overload!</li>
    <li> It was just what I was expecting, and I use it every day post shaving. My only complaint was with the supplier - the item was badly packaged, and the top had come loose in transit ( no safety seal? ), causing some of the product to leak into the packaging. Apart from that a very good product that lived up to my performance and price expectations.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Wakes you up</li>
    <li> Osage Rub lives up to the reviews I read before purchasing.  I am sure it is among the strongest astringent after shaves in the world. It has a high menthol content and both cools and burns with equal intensity upon application, taking several minutes to subside.  A great value and something very different and better than other old style products like Afta Shave or Aqua Velva.</li>
    <li> WOW !  t&#x27;s one of those mornings, you&#x27;ve showered, shaved but you&#x27;re still in a haze&lt;br /&gt;you just can&#x27;t seem to Wake Up !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of shakes on your scalp a vigorous massage and Brother you are ready to take on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still not fully awake splash a few drops into you palm an massage you face, keeping your eyes shut tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you&#x27;re awake.  This is GREAT STUFF !</li>
    <li> This is an amazing smell on a freshly shaven face.  While there is enough alcohol to drink it, if you are thirst it is a wonderful tonic.  Why local stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore is a great wonderment.  This is fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest and most menthol-ey aftershave there is! It is not for the faint of heart. My favorite aftershave. It leaves no residual perfume, so you can wear any cologne with it you like.</li>
    <li> brisk and  a good wake up call to your face. I have a feeling that I could also use if a a muscle liniment</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is strong!  Osage Rub has cooling properties like no other.  It feels great, especially in the summertime.  In fact, the cooling sensation is so strong that I can still feel it on my hands a half hour after washing them off.  The alcohol content gives it antiseptic qualities while the menthol cools and numbs the skin.  It has a wintergreen-type scent to it that dissipates rather quickly and disappears almost completely after it dries down.  You&#x27;ll appreciate this, especially if you wear cologne as it won&#x27;t overpower or clash with the scent. The healing properties aren&#x27;t necessarily the best out of all the aftershaves I&#x27;ve tried but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it sells for a bargain. It also comes in an enormous bottle so unless you&#x27;re constantly dousing yourself, it will last for years. If you enjoy mentholated aftershave splashes then you need to try this!</li>
    <li> I use this as aftershave as do a lot of &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; barber shops. Make sure you don&#x27;t handle the johnson, family jewels or eyes after you splash this on your face as you will be sorry. This potion is intense but really good.</li>
    <li> Nice cooling.  Dries to a sort of a cheap soapy smell.  Not really offensive, but not for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is refreashing. You put it on and after a minute or two begin to feel the sensations of cooling on the scalp. Unfortunately the feeling only lasts for about 20 minutes. Don&#x27;t get it too close to the eyes. Feels really good and worth the money just for the experience. This would make a good gift for a friend too.</li>
    <li> When using this product after you shave, it will feel like putting your face in a bucket of ice water.  I apply it through a small spray bottle, as I use less and it applies evenly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big Clubman fan, so I would probably like just about anything Clubman puts out. However, I really do like this splash/rub.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my entire body. I have very long hair, and I love the way this makes my hair/scalp smell, as well as my body.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a deodorant, (I haven&#x27;t used commercial deodorant for so long, I can&#x27;t even remember the last time I used deodorant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad Goodman&#x27;s still carries this, as well as a plethora of hard to find items. Thanks, Amazon, and Goodman&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and feel, somewhat reminiscent of formulations you may find in Europe. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;American.&amp;#34;  There is something about European formulations that is just &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; and this comes close.  Any ideas what it is?</li>
    <li> This stuff feels great on the face, but it smells like Robitussin. The smell does dissipate, and you can then apply your favorite post&#x3D;shave product. Overall, This product is worth the money for a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff helps out heaps with razor bumps. Old school and effective.</li>
    <li> It have nice smell and a very good bodybuilding rubbing ingredients.</li>
    <li> Best face tonic ever. Very cool and soothing.</li>
    <li> I gave this product five stars because I have used it for many years and I like it!&lt;br /&gt;It is a good splash, smells nice and a little goes a long way. I also used it in my bath water (yes my bath water) It relaxes and&lt;br /&gt;soothes while leaving an over-all tingly feeling. I would recommend this product to gentlemen of any age but the scent is probably&lt;br /&gt;more appealing to an older man.</li>
    <li> My husband had this used on him after visiting a barber shop and wanted some for himself.  He uses it every time he shaves and loves the product.  He says it&#x27;s cooling, refreshing and smells great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used aftershave balms, but was drawn to this product because I love menthol so much.  It has not disappointed.  The cooling effect is great, and it is effective at fighting razor burn.  If you really like menthol then you will like this product.  If you don&#x27;t like menthol then don&#x27;t bother.  For me the cold feeling is totally worth the burn. Osage Rub is now my favorite aftershave.</li>
    <li> The sweet burn that gently turns to ice.  This stuff burns just long enough to tell you it&#x27;s working, then cools right down and keeps you there for at least 30 mins.  THEN, splash on some aftershave to bring it right back and your good to go!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels better when I use Jeris Osage Rub, that is just a fact plain and simple.</li>
    <li> A perfect aftershave. Very cooling and soothing. There is a brief period where my face feels packed in ice. It mellows quickly. Great menthol eucalyptus smell but not overpowering and short-lived. Won&#x27;t clash with your cologne. Inexpensive.</li>
    <li> good after shower, before shaving.</li>
    <li> Refreshingly cold aftershave!  Very high menthol content.  This is the best you can get in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This product is like a bucket of ice water! Just like what you&#x27;re dad&#x27;s barber would have splashed on you after a haircut when you were growing up . It is very refreshing after a shower and/or shave. The menthol is very invigorating to the skin and scalp. It goes nice with a like scented aftershave such as [[ASIN:B00BOJ7JVO Proraso Aftershave Lotion, Refresh, 100 ml]]</li>
    <li> This product is great, very refreshing when splashed anywhere on body. Great for anytime but especially the summer. Personally, I add some menthol crystals into the bottle for extra oomph! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am willing to try anything that creates a good experience after shaving. So glad I purchased this Osage Rub. This is extremely refreshing to use after shaving and it smells great too. You can smell the menthol immediately after using and your Eyes almost feel like they are going to tear but they don&#x27;t. I really look forward to shaving in the morning now. A couple of Slaps with this OSAGE Rub and a good cup of coffee and you&#x27;ll be all set for the day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I use it post-shave when I have a few minutes to just enjoy the cool, refreshing feeling and then top it off with a favorite after-shave.  Reminds me of the old days getting a shave in the barber shop.</li>
    <li> Definitely has that strong menthol punch but I don&#x27;t find the scent has enough complexity to make it interesting enough for a daily driver. Nice wake up call, and worth giving a spin, but it won&#x27;t uproot your signature scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff gives you a great cooling blast to the scalp! I use it on my hair after a shower and it helps to relieve itch and control dandruff. It would be a nice aftershave too. The menthol is very cooling though so sometimes it is too much to use in the winter.</li>
    <li> It does what t is supposed to do. The scent is so so but it closes the pores and wakes you up.</li>
    <li> I looked around for a slightly astringent menthol rub for a while and bought this product. I love it along with all the other clubman products.</li>
    <li> I use Osage Rub as an aftershave splash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: This product is an absolute face-freezer.  Rubbing this on your face after a shave will reward you with an immediate burn from the alcohol followed by an eye-watering hit of menthol.  A few seconds later you will feel an intense cooling sensation from the menthol.  The scent is a strong menthol and eucalyptus blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  This product is VERY strongly scented so if you are sensitive to such things you might wish to avoid it (on the upside, the scent fades rapidly).  Also, I find that it is mildly drying so if you have dry skin you might want to avoid it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this four stars as I do find it more drying than I would like.  Still, very much worth the purchase.  Using it daily I expect this bottle to last me a year or more.</li>
    <li> This stuff is serious.  The bottle is bigger than I had envisioned, like a 20oz soda bottle.  The bottle is plastic but I don&#x27;t care, the stuff inside is menthol madness.  I&#x27;ve splashed it on straight like after shave, which i believe is the intended purpose, and man... that was intense.  I had to wash my face and then close my eyes for a minute calming my self from the intensity.  It literally left me wondering if minty freshness could be so intense that it could leave a chemical burn.  Luckily it did not.  Now I add a splash to my shaving cream mix and it is as mentholated as I can handle. The alcohol kills the lather in the shaving cream a tiny bit but not too bad, and I love the menthol added to my shaving cream.</li>
    <li> A strong long lasting menthol feeling without an over the top scent!&lt;br /&gt;My new go to after shave! Sorry Clubman Pinaud.</li>
    <li> I use Osage after I shave my head, and the tingling, invigorating sensation is amazing!  Great smell and great for cleansing the scalp and preventing pimples and blemishes.</li>
