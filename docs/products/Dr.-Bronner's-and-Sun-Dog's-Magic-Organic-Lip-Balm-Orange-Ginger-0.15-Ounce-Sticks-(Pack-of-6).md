### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The texture and feel on your lips is really perfect.</li>
      <li>It is a great find!</li>
      <li>I use this lip balm almost exclusively - the best emollient on the market, and i&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
      <li>This is a truly wonderful lip balm.</li>
      <li>The oils in it are great for the skin and my lips feel wonderful after a day of using it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>For a good, decently-priced lip balm - this takes the cake!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so moisturizing and has a very nice scent as well.</li>
      <li>I love this flavor and the peppermint one the best.</li>
      <li>Pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>This fit the bill, and I think that the flavor/smell is great!</li>
      <li>This is a great chapstick and haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
      <li>I love these!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS LIP BALM!</li>
      <li>i bought this because i LOVE the scent of this lip balm.</li>
      <li>Love this lip balm.</li>
      <li>Love the feel of it.</li>
      <li>I like this so much better than Burt&#x27;s Bees, which I think is too waxy, this adds more moisture.</li>
      <li>I just realized, it&#x27;s probably time to get my wife some more the of these for stocking stuffers...</li>
      <li>The orange scent is much more faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am a lip balm freak, this and Kiehl&#x27;s absolutely top my list.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>When I was a kid, Bonnie Bell did the trick - mostly because of all the flavors.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, all natural ingredients and organic as well.</li>
      <li>It has very like orange smell to it, which is good.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing first of all, when I get stomach aches</li>
      <li>Wonderful as an everyday lip balm.</li>
      <li>and in the beginning, i thought i really liked how it is kind of more greasy than other lip balms that i was used to, and how smooth it would glide on.</li>
      <li>It has a sweet spiciness and really has a nice aroma of ginger.</li>
      <li>Smooth and super hydrating without being oily.</li>
      <li>The fresh ginger aroma and the soothing feel of it make for a unique product.</li>
      <li>Perhaps some of the other flavors are better and more true to their origins.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>It wont chap your lips further and it conditions nicely with the slightest amount of shine.</li>
      <li>The orange ginger is a nice scent, I&#x27;m going to try the mint next.</li>
      <li>This lip balm is wonderfully smooth and goes on like a dream, giving my lips a silky feeling that lasts for a decent length of time.  </li>
      <li>I like this product especially because it&#x27;s made of healthy ingredients.</li>
      <li>Seems silly being enthusiastic about a lip balm, but I do love this one!</li>
      <li>This is a nice, natural lip balm especially if you don&#x27;t want something vanilla or mint flavored.</li>
      <li>makes my lips soft and they do not dry after using it for many many hours even if it is windy outside</li>
      <li>but somehow it&#x27;d almost dry my lips out more</li>
      <li>in all, I would certainly buy this brand again, although maybe not this flavor.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t much like the scent though.</li>
      <li>Joking aside, I really don&#x27;t like putting chemicals that close to my mouth, and some chap sticks seem to try out my lips.</li>
      <li>so the smell of ginger/citrus is very comforting to me.</li>
      <li>(that peppery, spicy flavor is something I love)</li>
      <li>Thanks Dr. Bronner, for making a lip balm no one died for and that doesn&#x27;t smell like feet and won&#x27;t grow into a tumor.</li>
      <li>This does need reapplied pretty frequently but for the results I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>so i&#x27;m going back to my favorite from the last 3 years-burt&#x27;s bees pomegranate lip balm.</li>
      <li>Love the scent can taste a little of the ginger too.</li>
      <li>and they got instant super soft!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is very nice upon first opening the tube (although a friend remarked that it smelled vaguely like Asian food, haha), but the flavor itself is somewhat lacking once on the lips.  </li>
      <li>Some have provided some partial relief while others actually seemed to make my lips feel dryer and more sensitive.</li>
      <li>Later in life, after trying to quit twice, and a jaw surgery that leaves me w/o feeling/moisture in the lower lip - I decided to spend a little more money and get something organic.</li>
      <li>the coconut oil acts as a natural sun screen.</li>
      <li>and/or citrusy (oranges especially have a very distinctive flavor profile)</li>
      <li>i tend to be sensitive toward lip balm.</li>
      <li>It also actually smells like what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like, unlike  gross smackers lip balm I used out of desperation today that was supposed to smell like Dr. Pepper but instead smelled like my feet when I go running in rubber shoes on a hot summer day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products in the past and have found them to be of high quality, so I decided to give this one a try.</li>
      <li>I generally dislike beeswax based lip balms because they make my lips feel sticky.  </li>
      <li>Thick enough without being greasy or waxy, goes on my lips smoothly and keeps them moisturized.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s slightly bitter if you lick it by accident, but it&#x27;s not off-putting enough to keep me from using it every day.  </li>
<li> This balm went on very smoothly, and instantly soothed my dry, painful lips.</li>
<li> No need to reapply like other brands.</li>
<li> I get chapped lips each winter, I&#x27;ve tried several lip balms and salves in the past.</li>

<li> It is very heavy on the ginger.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as thick.</li>
<li> and I can always picture those nasty little chemicals slipping from my lips into my otherwise free-of-toxins body and growing into a massive tumor!</li>
<li> **ing serious?</li>
<li> My skin is very sensitive and some products make my lips worst, but this one works well.</li>
<li> but this is, unfortunately, neither.  </li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
<li> I am always afraid of non-organic lip balms because my worst fear is getting cancer</li>

    <li> This is a great product, all natural ingredients and organic as well. the coconut oil acts as a natural sun screen. Love the scent can taste a little of the ginger too. love it.</li>
    <li> I love these! I am always afraid of non-organic lip balms because my worst fear is getting cancer and I can always picture those nasty little chemicals slipping from my lips into my otherwise free-of-toxins body and growing into a massive tumor! I am 100% that is how cancer works. Joking aside, I really don&#x27;t like putting chemicals that close to my mouth, and some chap sticks seem to try out my lips. Not this one! It smells amazing first of all, when I get stomach aches I make a tea of sliced ginger root and lemon and so the smell of ginger/citrus is very comforting to me. It also actually smells like what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like, unlike  gross smackers lip balm I used out of desperation today that was supposed to smell like Dr. Pepper but instead smelled like my feet when I go running in rubber shoes on a hot summer day. It also doesn&#x27;t contain petroleum jelly. People kill people for petroleum and you want me to put it on my lips? Are you ****ing serious? Thanks Dr. Bronner, for making a lip balm no one died for and that doesn&#x27;t smell like feet and won&#x27;t grow into a tumor.</li>
    <li> I use this lip balm almost exclusively - the best emollient on the market, and i&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product and OMG!! I could feel this tingly on lips and they got instant super soft! Not to greasy nor thick ...is right. it been 3 hours and after eating I still have it on. No need to reapply like other brands. It has very like orange smell to it, which is good. Will recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, natural lip balm especially if you don&#x27;t want something vanilla or mint flavored. It has a sweet spiciness and really has a nice aroma of ginger. Wonderful as an everyday lip balm. It wont chap your lips further and it conditions nicely with the slightest amount of shine.</li>
    <li> I have always used lip balm. When I was a kid, Bonnie Bell did the trick - mostly because of all the flavors. Later in life, after trying to quit twice, and a jaw surgery that leaves me w/o feeling/moisture in the lower lip - I decided to spend a little more money and get something organic. This fit the bill, and I think that the flavor/smell is great! I love this flavor and the peppermint one the best. For a good, decently-priced lip balm - this takes the cake!</li>
    <li> I just realized, it&#x27;s probably time to get my wife some more the of these for stocking stuffers... I&#x27;ll have to check to see if she still has some</li>
    <li> I like this product especially because it&#x27;s made of healthy ingredients. I don&#x27;t much like the scent though. I&#x27;ve switched from Alba to this. It&#x27;s not as thick.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LIP BALM! No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I generally dislike beeswax based lip balms because they make my lips feel sticky.  This lip balm is wonderfully smooth and goes on like a dream, giving my lips a silky feeling that lasts for a decent length of time.  The oils in it are great for the skin and my lips feel wonderful after a day of using it.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very nice upon first opening the tube (although a friend remarked that it smelled vaguely like Asian food, haha), but the flavor itself is somewhat lacking once on the lips.  It&#x27;s slightly bitter if you lick it by accident, but it&#x27;s not off-putting enough to keep me from using it every day.  I would expect an orange ginger lip balm to be actually gingery (that peppery, spicy flavor is something I love) and/or citrusy (oranges especially have a very distinctive flavor profile) but this is, unfortunately, neither.  Perhaps some of the other flavors are better and more true to their origins.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would certainly buy this brand again, although maybe not this flavor.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. Thick enough without being greasy or waxy, goes on my lips smoothly and keeps them moisturized. Pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This is the lip balm of my dreams. The texture and feel on your lips is really perfect. It is deeply moisturizing but still feels lightweight. The blend of jojoba, avocado and cannabis sativa oils is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not for everyone. It is very heavy on the ginger. I used ginger essential oil a lot during my pregnancy to help with morning sickness. I personally find the smell itself soothing, however if you&#x27;re not a fan of ginger I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. The orange scent is much more faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see the ingredients listed on this page-- but for any vegans out there who don&#x27;t do beeswax, this product does contain it.</li>
    <li> makes my lips soft and they do not dry after using it for many many hours even if it is windy outside</li>
    <li> I get chapped lips each winter, I&#x27;ve tried several lip balms and salves in the past. Some have provided some partial relief while others actually seemed to make my lips feel dryer and more sensitive. I&#x27;ve used many other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products in the past and have found them to be of high quality, so I decided to give this one a try. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This balm went on very smoothly, and instantly soothed my dry, painful lips. I find that I need to re-apply 6-8 times a day.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and some products make my lips worst, but this one works well. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a truly wonderful lip balm. It keeps my lips moist without the sticky felling and works well with any lip stick without smearing it. I keep several in my handbag and night stand. Love the feel of it.</li>
    <li> i bought this because i LOVE the scent of this lip balm. i still do. and in the beginning, i thought i really liked how it is kind of more greasy than other lip balms that i was used to, and how smooth it would glide on. but somehow it&#x27;d almost dry my lips out more and so i end up having to apply it every few minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s quite possible that this just doesn&#x27;t work for me though. i tend to be sensitive toward lip balm. so i&#x27;m going back to my favorite from the last 3 years-burt&#x27;s bees pomegranate lip balm. it&#x27;s so moisturizing and has a very nice scent as well.</li>
    <li> The chapstick used to be thicker, but I still like it a lot. This is a great chapstick and haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> Smooth and super hydrating without being oily. I like this so much better than Burt&#x27;s Bees, which I think is too waxy, this adds more moisture. This does need reapplied pretty frequently but for the results I don&#x27;t mind. The orange ginger is a nice scent, I&#x27;m going to try the mint next. I am a lip balm freak, this and Kiehl&#x27;s absolutely top my list.</li>
    <li> Seems silly being enthusiastic about a lip balm, but I do love this one! The fresh ginger aroma and the soothing feel of it make for a unique product. It is a great find!</li>
