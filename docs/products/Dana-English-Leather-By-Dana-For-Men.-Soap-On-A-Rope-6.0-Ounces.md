      <li>It&#x27;s a great gift, and my friend really likes it.</li>
      <li>I love the soap as well as the bowl.</li>
      <li>This was the perfect addition to the English Leather gift set I arranged for my husband.</li>
      <li>He thoroughly enjoyed using it.</li>
      <li>As a child of the 60s,I had longed for this unique and popular product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased it is still available.</li>
      <li>The soap smells great, and it produces a very nice thick lather, but it lasts maybe 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>I originally bought this product for humor, but it&#x27;s actually pretty handy to have a rope attached.</li>
      <li>Bought this as a fun little gift for my husband&#x27;s stocking and he loves it :) Smells great, and the rope is handy for hanging in the shower.</li>
      <li>Cleans smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was well priced considering it had free shipping.</li>
      <li>Smells great like all English leather products.</li>
      <li>This soap will also fit into another product.</li>
      <li>This is a treat now when I can relive that scent and clean feeling.</li>
      <li>The bar produced vast amounts of suds, smells great, priced just right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but there is a lot of it.</li>
      <li>I guess you have to spend more to get a decent soap on a rope.</li>
      <li>but it came quickly &amp; looked just like the picture.</li>
      <li>My male family loves them and had to buy more!</li>
      <li>English Leather is a Timeless Scent-I love its Musky- Outdoorzeee- Gentlemens Fragrance!</li>
      <li>It is powerful.</li>
      <li>Fun throwback and useful, too.</li>
      <li>otherwise product seems to be all right</li>
      <li>I am pasting the name right here.</li>
      <li>This is one of the most basic and fun products I&#x27;ve bought for myself or others.  </li>
      <li>My hard to buy for dad seemed rather happy to receive it.</li>
      <li>My wife used to be able to buy simple soaps-on-ropes by the case.</li>
      <li>After first use soap split.</li>
      <li>Have yet to hear from the co. selling British Sterling, the co. that charges 100% more to ship.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping speed and very well protected.</li>
      <li>The only caveat is that if you don&#x27;t like strong smells, then you won&#x27;t like this product.</li>
      <li>He got it in April, and it&#x27;s still going strong three months later.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants soap on a rope.</li>
      <li>If the aesthetics are an important factor, do note that the bar and the rope are both white, not like the photo.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really matter since soap comes apart into two pieces after a couple of uses and rope/noose no longer attached.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll order more in the near future.</li>
      <li>Has true English Leather smell and conditions skin quite well.</li>
      <li>This is quite simply a bar of soap on a rope, pretty much identical to the ones in the dollar store.</li>
      <li>Plus it is a nice big bar that will last a long time.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell particularly masculine, just like a normal bar of soap.</li>
      <li>Now, we find them only at Amazon and for pretty steep prices for perfumed soaps.</li>
      <li>down its. full length .</li>
      <li>A fun novelty gift but considering how often you&#x27;d need to replace this product its not a very economical choice.</li>
      <li>This brings back the memories of Saturday nights in a convertable running up and down the main roads with my now wife-</li>

<li> , however the rope was only long enough to put around his wrist.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with soap on the rope for the man who already has everything, and it smells fantastic.  </li>
<li> Soap on a rope was a common gift in the past, but today&#x27;s youth aren&#x27;t familiar with it.  </li>
<li> falls off the rope within a week, and is subject to the same Chinese quality control that has killed people and pets.  </li>
<li> Smells weak, it started separating in half after first use...</li>
<li> I had to break this up into small pieces, then microwave with some water for two thirty second zaps all in the porcelain shaving bowl</li>
<li> the men love it/them and expect it in their Christmas stockings and are truly disappointed when i have trouble locating them ...</li>
<li> This is soap on a rope so you can hang it, and it is a hard milled soap so it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> When hanging on a peg it is less messy that grouping for a soap dish.</li>
<li> My dad has been using the soap on a rope since I was a little girl.</li>
<li> reason I ordered this Soap on a Rope was so my disabled husband would not&lt;br /&gt;be dropping it and have to pick it up.  </li>
<li> This &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; is now made in China, smells awefu,l and splits and falls off the rope in just a few days.  </li>
<li> It is rather harsh and can cause quite a bit of discomfort.</li>
<li> For someone who has trouble handling soap in the shower, this is the solution.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately soap fell from rope when half of it was still left.</li>
<li> As usual Amizon came through.</li>
<li> Not able to hang by rope.</li>
<li> After my husband had a stroke, it&#x27;s hard for him to grip &amp; hold a bar of soap.</li>
<li> product can be hard to find</li>
<li> Sadly this soap works too well.</li>
<li> This is a sorry product.</li>
<li> A difficult item to find and my father loves it.</li>
<li> Talk about a waste of $12 or whatever the heck outrageous price I paid.  </li>
<li> I was SO disappointed when this soap broke OFF THE ROPE after four days use.&lt;br</li>
<li> Smells awful.</li>

    <li> Rope too short. Should be Soap on a Noose. Doesn&#x27;t really matter since soap comes apart into two pieces after a couple of uses and rope/noose no longer attached. This is a sorry product.</li>
    <li> Soap fell off the rope after about a week in the shower.  Give me a break!  Talk about a waste of $12 or whatever the heck outrageous price I paid.  I renounce thee, rope soap!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent &amp; a great stocking stuffer for the men.  Excellent price, too.</li>
    <li> A difficult item to find and my father loves it.</li>
    <li> This was the perfect addition to the English Leather gift set I arranged for my husband. Shipping was speedy &amp; well packaged. I have no complaints &amp; will be purchasing this item again in the future.</li>
    <li> Smells weak, it started separating in half after first use... A two dollars bar of soap is a better purchase.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift, so I can&#x27;t say what it&#x27;s like to use - but it came quickly &amp; looked just like the picture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since the 1960&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m pleased it is still available.</li>
    <li> For someone who has trouble handling soap in the shower, this is the solution.  Plus it is a nice big bar that will last a long time.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping speed and very well protected. One of the best soaps out there. Has true English Leather smell and conditions skin quite well. This is soap on a rope so you can hang it, and it is a hard milled soap so it lasts a long time. Lathers quite well and the smell endures through the soap&#x27;s entire useage. One of the best, and one of the best prices.</li>
    <li> Bought for my dad who used to receive as a gift from me every fathers day when I was a kid. Now I cannot find it in any stores. I thought it was well priced considering it had free shipping. My hard to buy for dad seemed rather happy to receive it.</li>
    <li> This item broke apart during the second use.  I guess you have to spend more to get a decent soap on a rope.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most basic and fun products I&#x27;ve bought for myself or others.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with soap on the rope for the man who already has everything, and it smells fantastic.  Also, its nice that the scent washes off so that it does not commingle with deodorant or cologne applied after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also pairs well with a glass of your favorite scotch taken in the shower.</li>
    <li> Hope they make more! My male family loves them and had to buy more!</li>
    <li> I was SO disappointed when this soap broke OFF THE ROPE after four days use.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I ordered this Soap on a Rope was so my disabled husband would not&lt;br /&gt;be dropping it and have to pick it up.  Darn.</li>
    <li> Tuccini ships 6 oz soap for approx 3 bucks and is always reliable.  However the suggestion of AMAZON that British Sterling is sometimes bought in tandem moved me to buy it.  However, the BS soap, also 6 oz., costs approx 6 bucks in shipping.  Tuccini has already notified me it has shipped its product.  Have yet to hear from the co. selling British Sterling, the co. that charges 100% more to ship.</li>
    <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED FOR STIOCKING STUFFERS FOR CHRISTMAS.&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS GOOD - EASY TO USE.  RECCOMMEND IT TO FRIEND AND FAMILY.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a fun little gift for my husband&#x27;s stocking and he loves it :) Smells great, and the rope is handy for hanging in the shower.</li>
    <li> After my husband had a stroke, it&#x27;s hard for him to grip &amp; hold a bar of soap. Putting the rope around his wrist helps him to hold it. Wish they were cheaper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great gift, and my friend really likes it. He got it in April, and it&#x27;s still going strong three months later.The only caveat is that if you don&#x27;t like strong smells, then you won&#x27;t like this product. I walked into his house, and I could smell the soap from his bathroom ~50 ft away. It is powerful. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but there is a lot of it.</li>
    <li> My wife used to be able to buy simple soaps-on-ropes by the case.Now, we find them only at Amazon and for pretty steep prices for perfumed soaps.Ii&#x27;m not complaining, yhough, as, one-handed, this is the best kind of shower soap for me.. I&#x27;m thankful to find them and happy I have the resources to nuy as many as I need.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great but I cannot hang it by the rope in the shower area it will dissolve</li>
    <li> xmas gift for my dad&lt;br /&gt;This product can be hard to find so it was great!</li>
    <li> Soap on a rope was a common gift in the past, but today&#x27;s youth aren&#x27;t familiar with it.  This was purchased for my son, a college student.  He thought it was a neat idea...</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell particularly masculine, just like a normal bar of soap. It also leaves that &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; kind of feeling on your skin, so I hope you also use a moisturiser. If the aesthetics are an important factor, do note that the bar and the rope are both white, not like the photo. Another reviewer said that the product has changed since being manufactured in China, so that might explain the generic quality of the product. This is quite simply a bar of soap on a rope, pretty much identical to the ones in the dollar store.</li>
    <li> Smells good.  Cleans smoothly.  Saves bending over in the shower.  When hanging on a peg it is less messy that grouping for a soap dish.</li>
    <li> This has become a tradition in my family- the men love it/them and expect it in their Christmas stockings and are truly disappointed when i have trouble locating them ...thank you</li>
    <li> Smells nice - but a bit spendy for soap.</li>
    <li> Great soap on a rope for my husband.  He thoroughly enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> Love it for my husband and son!</li>
    <li> Makes great shaving soap. I had to break this up into small pieces, then microwave with some water for two thirty second zaps all in the porcelain shaving bowl (with two side ears) that I had bought from Amazon. This soap has a nice smell for shaving. I will be queuing up some shaving soap from Provence, France that I intend to buy from Amazon.com. ADDENDUM: This soap will also fit into another product. I am pasting the name right here. Ceramic Shaving Bowl with Handles and Shaving Logo&lt;br /&gt;by DM. It is also sold by Amazon.com. I love the soap as well as the bowl.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; is now made in China, smells awefu,l and splits and falls off the rope in just a few days.  It simply is not the same product that it was.  Hopefully there are no Chinese &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; ingredients that are unhealthful.  The packaging varies suggesting any low bidder Chinese factory gets the job.  Smells awful. falls off the rope within a week, and is subject to the same Chinese quality control that has killed people and pets.  Use at your own risk.</li>
    <li> The soap smells great, and it produces a very nice thick lather, but it lasts maybe 3 weeks. A fun novelty gift but considering how often you&#x27;d need to replace this product its not a very economical choice.</li>
    <li> English Leather is a Timeless Scent-I love its Musky- Outdoorzeee- Gentlemens Fragrance! And...who doesnt love the convenience of Soap On A rope!</li>
    <li> Bought it for my handicapped husband  thought he could wrap rope around hand to help it from falling to floor.  Unfortunately soap fell from rope when half of it was still left.</li>
    <li> My dad has been using the soap on a rope since I was a little girl. My mom asked me to order it for her to give him for Father&#x27;s Day. Although the delivery estimate was longer than most of my orders, it came in 2 days, making my mom (and therefore, me) very happy.</li>
    <li> This soap smells good and manly.  My husband had another stroke before using this soap on a rope.  I bought it because before his stroke he could not hold anything in his hands and I was going to use the soap around his neck, however the rope was only long enough to put around his wrist.  For anyone else who can hold soap in their hands, this would be excellent.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants soap on a rope.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift years ago and never could find it again. This is a treat now when I can relive that scent and clean feeling.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for the guy in your life.  Fun throwback and useful, too.</li>
    <li> Did not last 23 showers no longer than reg bar soap;(in The 60s bar lasted minimum of 50 to 55 showers at quarter of the price. Would not recommend the bar at this price.</li>
    <li> I have been giving my dad soap on a rope since I was a lttle girl, happy to find product here. Smells good.</li>
    <li> Smells great like all English leather products.</li>
    <li> The bar produced vast amounts of suds, smells great, priced just right. I&#x27;ll order more in the near future. As usual Amizon came through.</li>
    <li> Our son has to have soap on a rope . He only has one hand , so the rope helps to shower by himself.</li>
    <li> This brings back the memories of Saturday nights in a convertable running up and down the main roads with my now wife-she shares this rememberance also-English Leather was big in the day.</li>
    <li> As a child of the 60s,I had longed for this unique and popular product.Now I have it again and everybody is asking:What is that you are wearing?</li>
    <li> Sadly this soap works too well. It is rather harsh and can cause quite a bit of discomfort. Oh well.</li>
    <li> After first use soap split. down its. full length . I should receive a replacement. Not able to hang by rope. otherwise product seems to be all right</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product for humor, but it&#x27;s actually pretty handy to have a rope attached. Plus it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Loved the bar soap and quick service.</li>
