      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve had no experience with using magnifying mirrors, but nobody liked this mirror because of this feature.  </li>
      <li>It looks good and works OK.</li>
      <li>The mirror itself is nice, sturdy, and well made.</li>
      <li>Strong construction, but looks very elegant on my dressing table.</li>

      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>than just a wish of a person who doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank on a SECOND mirror, this is about as perfect as you can get</li>
      <li>A lovely mirror.</li>
      <li>love this mirror</li>
      <li>the more it gets used.</li>
      <li>On the other side is an excellent 1x mirror that measures 7 2/3 inches in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>10X makes it easy to see without glasses.&lt;br</li>
      <li>would strongly advise that you know what strength magnification you are looking for, if that matters to you, before trying a 10X version.  </li>
      <li>It establishes a strong foundation so there is no worry that this pedestal mirror is going to fall over.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lovely on my make up table and is true-</li>
      <li>The mirror itself was perfect, right size, nice quality, and attractive, but we had to return it due to this single problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Perfect - Heavy and works well.</li>
      <li>Measures exactly 7 inches in diameter across the mirror, which is beautifully framed in smooth, brushed nickel.</li>
      <li>she&#x27;s right!</li>
      <li>Top quality 10x magnification that lets me really see my face.</li>
      <li>The only positive thing about it is that the pedestal is attractive.</li>
      <li>I had my doubts about ordering this item because neither the description nor the customer reviews described it adequately.</li>
      <li>She says its a nice big size, sturdy bottom with felt and</li>
      <li>quality of vision of my old x5 mirror is a lot better than the  Zadro VAN x 10</li>
      <li>I liked the power that the mirror has, but I need a mirror with a larger circumference on it</li>
      <li>I just wish I could find a reasonably priced mirror exactly like this with a built in light.  </li>
      <li>I was at TJMax this Sunday and the exact, nameless,Zadro look-alike mirrors are selling for $ 14.99 to 16.99</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll never purchase this type of mirror again without trying it first..</li>
      <li>I ordered this mirror after reading the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>It was accurately described and seems to work properly.  </li>
      <li>fast shipping</li>
      <li>My wife really likes this mirror.  </li>
      <li>Very substantil size and weight  and pleasing to look at on any dressing table.</li>
      <li>Good study, heavy clear mirror.</li>
      <li>The magnification on one side is scary :) Lovely sturdy mirror.</li>
      <li>I bought this mirror for me getting older</li>
      <li>cosy to replace was high</li>
      <li>: The pedestal itself is about 7 3/4 inches high and the mirror is attached to a half-circle of metal attached to the pedestal.</li>
      <li>It needs a large enough area on the magnifying side to see an area</li>
      <li>You have to position yourself just so to see anything clearly.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up too much counter space and the dual 10x and regular view sides</li>
      <li>so the magnification is helpful at times, the weight is heavy enough to be stable even if bumped slightly, size is large enough to see whole image right in front,  but small enough to be moved easily from table to desk and room to room.  </li>
      <li>This was a gift for our son-in-law and based on what he and the other six people in the room had to say, the 10X magnification on one side is so large it&#x27;s unusable.  </li>
      <li>I will shop Amazon again for the same power mirror but a larger one, like a Kimball &amp; Young.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that its distance for viewing is short, considerably shorter than expected.  </li>
      <li>so I can see my whole face and not just half of it.  </li>
      <li>I am so very pleased with the mirror that I am going to attempt to give a fuller description so other potential buyers can base their decisions on adequate information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> : Solid and heavy, over 2 pounds 12 ounces overall.</li>
<li> With vision as bad as mine, that is an important feature for me.  </li>

<li> The brushed satin nickel of the base, pedestal, and mirror frame give this mirror a refined elegance that goes well with the satin nickel fixtures in our master bathroom.</li>
<li> POOR QUALITY!</li>
<li> This makes some areas difficult to see.  </li>
<li> No face should be that scary and allowed out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> or if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with any aspect of this product.</li>
<li> The mirror&#x27;s base measures just over 5 1/4 inches in diameter.</li>

    <li> Great magnification! Good size at a great price</li>
    <li> Nail Tek products are excellent!!  I&#x27;ve been using this for years!  When I use this product my nails are stronger and healthier!  Buy this and try it!!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for our son-in-law and based on what he and the other six people in the room had to say, the 10X magnification on one side is so large it&#x27;s unusable.

    <li> Bought this as an &amp;#34;Open Box&amp;#34;/used product from the Warehouse, and it was in perfect shape.  The mirror is very nice.  As the last reviewer mentioned, the 10X side is scary :)  Hah...she&#x27;s right! You&#x27;ve got to get close, but the magnification is great if you need it.  I love it.  Looks nice, good weight, nice finish...just perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Zadro VAN10 Two sided vanity swivel mirror,Satin Nickel, 1x and 10 x&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of vision of my old x5 mirror is a lot better than the  Zadro VAN x 10 and....also,.I was at TJMax this Sunday and the exact, nameless,Zadro look-alike mirrors are selling for $ 14.99 to 16.99&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  I will appreciate if Amazon stops sending me daily Advertising Emails.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Falco</li>
    <li> Good study, heavy clear mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a client. Since hers was cracked.</li>
    <li> was a gift. my mom loves it. way more beautiful in person. fast shipping</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror for me getting older so the magnification is helpful at times, the weight is heavy enough to be stable even if bumped slightly, size is large enough to see whole image right in front,  but small enough to be moved easily from table to desk and room to room.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m ordering 2 more so I don&#x27;t have to keep moving one from room to room, it is that useful when you need to snip a hair or check a hem or look at a back area to see how things are situated and putting on makeup in a delicate area.  Very handy item the more it gets used.</li>
    <li> love this mirror the quality was 100 % better than I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Perfect - Heavy and works well.</li>
    <li> A lovely mirror. Very substantil size and weight  and pleasing to look at on any dressing table. A WINNER!!! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this lovely mirror...</li>
    <li> Wonderful make-up mirror.  Has lots of heft so it&#x27;s not easily tipped over.  Would like one in a square shape too.</li>
    <li> It was accurately described and seems to work properly.  The ordering and delivery experience was as promised and I am quite happy with that.  I was surprised that its distance for viewing is short, considerably shorter than expected.  This makes some areas difficult to see.  It looks good and works OK.</li>
    <li> I had a lit magnifying mirror but the bulb broke and I scratched the silver/mirror paint installing the replacement which got worse as time went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cosy to replace was high so I went with this.  It&#x27;s lovely on my make up table and is true-I haven&#x27;t noticed any warping in the mirrors.  I just wish I could find a reasonably priced mirror exactly like this with a built in light.  I use a small lamp when using the magnifying side so I work around it. B&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than just a wish of a person who doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank on a SECOND mirror, this is about as perfect as you can get</li>
    <li> Nice mirror works great on my vanity.  I can actually see now when applying makeup!  Strong construction, but looks very elegant on my dressing table.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an attractive mirror.  It needs a large enough area on the magnifying side to see an area well, which this mirror has.</li>
    <li> This mirror is attractive and is great to have. 10X makes it easy to see without glasses.&lt;br /&gt;Every home should have one.</li>
    <li> A nice weight, both mirrors are great, perfect size to sit on a table, dresser, etc. to sit at and put on makeup, nigh cream, etc. Love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this mirror after reading the positive reviews. The reviewers must not have purchased the same mirror that I did. The only positive thing about it is that the pedestal is attractive. Otherwise the magnification side is VERY DISTORTED with a small in focus viewing area. POOR QUALITY! You have to position yourself just so to see anything clearly. Too much trouble to return. Lesson learned.  I&#x27;ll never purchase this type of mirror again without trying it first..</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about ordering this item because neither the description nor the customer reviews described it adequately. I am so very pleased with the mirror that I am going to attempt to give a fuller description so other potential buyers can base their decisions on adequate information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10X MIRROR: Measures exactly 7 inches in diameter across the mirror, which is beautifully framed in smooth, brushed nickel. Top quality 10x magnification that lets me really see my face. Great for applying mascara and using microdermabrasion. Great for my husband for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1X MIRROR: On the other side is an excellent 1x mirror that measures 7 2/3 inches in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEIGHT: Solid and heavy, over 2 pounds 12 ounces overall. The mirror&#x27;s base measures just over 5 1/4 inches in diameter. It establishes a strong foundation so there is no worry that this pedestal mirror is going to fall over. Well-balanced and stable on the tabletop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEIGHT: The pedestal itself is about 7 3/4 inches high and the mirror is attached to a half-circle of metal attached to the pedestal. The total height is just over 15 1/2 inches. It&#x27;s a perfect height for my vanity table, putting the mirror at exactly the right height so I can see my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL QUALITY: The brushed satin nickel of the base, pedestal, and mirror frame give this mirror a refined elegance that goes well with the satin nickel fixtures in our master bathroom. It&#x27;s a great looking mirror that is much more attractive than the photo shows. The nickel does not have the dull gray look of the photo.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and she loves it!!  She says its a nice big size, sturdy bottom with felt and the finish is gorgeous!</li>
