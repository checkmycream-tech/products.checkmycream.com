      <li>So glad I found this!</li>
      <li>I was able to find that out using my handy BUYcott app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to have a ton of conditioners in rotation because I could never find a good coating one, this one is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Made my hair feel stronger and more resilient and elastic, smoothed my hair, thereby demolishing my frizz.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product for deep conditioning the hair.</li>
      <li>I love these products but this description says shampoo and the picture is conditioner</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
      <li>Makes hair feel so smooth and silky!</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that the fragrance isn&#x27;t over the top.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product and my hair loves it more.</li>
      <li>was the MANY REASONS, aside from being eco-friendly to love this product.  </li>
      <li>After 2 uses, my hair was smoother, straighter, and more manageable.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t over the top and the set offers great cleaning, nourishment, and detangling.</li>
      <li>Great for natural African-American hair.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair and the keratin seems to work just fine for me on humid days.</li>

      <li>Happy to buy the bigger bottle.</li>
      <li>It smells really nice, not too overpowering, very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>

      <li>The conditioning is great, it gives your hair the moisture it needs without weighing it down, or leaving a greasy feel.</li>
      <li>My hair felt really strong and my curl pattern was really enhanced.  </li>
      <li>MY HAIR STRAIGHT!!</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to add more, which is always the case even with my old Pantene for Curls,</li>
      <li>Since becoming pregnant my hair has been really dry and easily breaks.</li>
      <li>Works really well and lets my hair do what it does naturally even better.  </li>
      <li>First I thought it may have been stress, but then I tried giving my hair a break from the 2chic shampoo and conditioner and trying something else</li>
      <li>This is the first cruelty free conditioner I have found to be extremely thick and coating, and I have tried many.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it for curly hair!</li>
      <li>it makes my hair very shiny wthout all the chemicals others have in them.</li>
      <li>Lives the hair very silky</li>
      <li>I purchased this product at Whole Foods for my 4a hair.  </li>
      <li>I found this on sale, and had liked giovanni products in the past</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using them and have been using regular Pantene and my scalp is back to healthy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s all natural now</li>
      <li>After rinsing and drying my hair is soft and shiney.</li>
      <li>Well, first I should mention, you MUST by the SHAMPOO version of this product as well, because they compliment each other so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A little dab will do ya, about 1 tbsp conditioned my whole head</li>

    <li> Great conditioner. The smell isn&#x27;t over the top and the set offers great cleaning, nourishment, and detangling. Happy to buy the bigger bottle. Mine did ship a little poorly (the pump came unscrewed and leaked) but not much product was lost.</li>
    <li> very good product is recommended</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at Whole Foods for my 4a hair.  I wanted something with slip that was sulfate free and unrelated to Monsanto&#x27;s empire of products.  I was able to find that out using my handy BUYcott app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t count on was the MANY REASONS, aside from being eco-friendly to love this product.  Well, first I should mention, you MUST by the SHAMPOO version of this product as well, because they compliment each other so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A little dab will do ya, about 1 tbsp conditioned my whole head and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to add more, which is always the case even with my old Pantene for Curls, stand-by conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;2. It smells really nice, not too overpowering, very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;3. There&#x27;s quite enough slip for my taste! Meaning, my hair didn&#x27;t tangle into those fairy knots while I was rinsing, which always means, I&#x27;m losing hair.&lt;br /&gt;4. My hair felt really strong and my curl pattern was really enhanced.  It seemed to elongate the curls a bit.&lt;br /&gt;5. I&#x27;m thinking this 24oz bottle will last me for months.</li>
    <li> As I get older my hair was getting a bit dry and dull.....as soon as I started using this product line I noticed a big difference!</li>
    <li> This is my go-to conditioner and saving grace!! I&#x27;ve been using the Brazilian Keratin and Argan Oil Conditioner for about a year now. I have curly, 3B, dry and frizzy hair. This conditioner has great slip and helps in taming the frizz (of course I follow up with a leave-in conditioner and gel). I would highly recommend it for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It softened, stretched my kinky curly hair (I&#x27;m a black woman with natural kinky hair). Made my hair feel stronger and more resilient and elastic, smoothed my hair, thereby demolishing my frizz.</li>
    <li> Good would recommend to family and friends great product.</li>
    <li> Lives the hair very silky</li>

    <li> Works really well and lets my hair do what it does naturally even better.  Frizz is cut down and my hair is SO SOFT!</li>
    <li> I love these products but this description says shampoo and the picture is conditioner and I received conditioner. Wanted shampoo!</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good choice for an every day vegan conditioner.</li>
    <li> this stuff rocks for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Since becoming pregnant my hair has been really dry and easily breaks. I was using Wen, and was getting no results. I found this on sale, and had liked giovanni products in the past so I gave it a try. After 2 uses, my hair was smoother, straighter, and more manageable. After a week, my hair was back to pre-pregnancy condition. The conditioning is great, it gives your hair the moisture it needs without weighing it down, or leaving a greasy feel. So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Giovanni junkie! Everything came on time and perfectly packaged in a box. Very pleased!!! Great for natural African-American hair. Buy the shampoo too!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Makes hair feel so smooth and silky!</li>
    <li> bought this in may, still haven&#x27;t finished it, leaves my hair feeling so silky I can&#x27;t stop touching it. best part? I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO STRAIGHTEN OR BLOW DRY MY HAIR STRAIGHT!! it&#x27;s all natural now noo friz no split ends!</li>
    <li> big difference in smoothness and manageability when i use 2chic!</li>
    <li> Excellent leave in conditioner and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have wavy hair and the keratin seems to work just fine for me on humid days. I also like the fact that the fragrance isn&#x27;t over the top.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for deep conditioning the hair. I put the conditioner on, place a thin shower cap over it and sit under a bonnet dryer for about 20 minutes. After rinsing and drying my hair is soft and shiney.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 shampoos and 2 conditioners (the big ones) back in April at the owners appreciation weekend at my local co-op. It was expensive. Almost $55 in total. I began using them after I finished what I had, which was around the end of April. And that&#x27;s when I started having trouble. My hair looked fine, but towards the end of the day I would get really bad dandruff. It was a soft, weird type of dandruff that would fall in big chunks on my shoulders. It was a bit nasty. First I thought it may have been stress, but then I tried giving my hair a break from the 2chic shampoo and conditioner and trying something else and that&#x27;s when I noticed that when I would use other shampoos for a couple of days, I wouldn&#x27;t get the weird dandruff. And when I would go back to 2chic, the dandruff came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using them and have been using regular Pantene and my scalp is back to healthy. I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in shampoo and conditioner. Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> I love this product and my hair loves it more.</li>
    <li> The order came as promised. The product is great. I have long hair it makes my hair very shiny wthout all the chemicals others have in them. It smells good enough to eat!</li>
    <li> See comments on the shampoo. This stuff works the way it says it works.</li>
    <li> conditioners don&#x27;t work for my hair. once i rinse them out, hair becomes dry once again. this had the same result.</li>
