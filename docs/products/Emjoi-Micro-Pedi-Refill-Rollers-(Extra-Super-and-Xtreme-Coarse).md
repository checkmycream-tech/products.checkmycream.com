### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Work perfectly i my Emjoi Micro-Pedi unit.</li>
      <li>Excellent!!!!!</li>
      <li>Work&#x27;s awesomely!</li>
      <li>Great price-great rollers</li>
      <li>work great on callous no problems with delivery</li>
      <li>These work great</li>
      <li>Works great with my Emjoi.</li>
      <li>They work just great</li>
      <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these !!</li>
      <li>2 maybe 3 times more use per roll.</li>
      <li>The price is great, much cheaper than the brand name.</li>
      <li>the rollers work fine.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and keeps my feet callus free between pedicures.</li>
      <li>Fine as replacement heads.</li>
      <li>these rollers fit the longer versions too.</li>
      <li>Then once or twice a week I my feet a light going over to maintain the smooth feet.</li>
      <li>Having a choice of roller strength makes the product more useful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that you do get what you pay for.  </li>
      <li>If you clean them with the tooth brush after every use you should get far more uses out of each roller than if you choose not to.</li>
      <li>Had not had a professional pedicure in years, the super coarse refill roller worked great on the &amp;#34;summer sandal heels&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>, I was so happen to get them on Amazon and the price was very reasonable.</li>
      <li>and I had one of the better ones last me over 2 years.</li>
      <li>These are exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described by the seller.</li>
      <li>Purchased as refill after the first set included with the Emjoi Micro-pedi device wore out.  </li>
      <li>Anyway I am satisfied with the rollers but see no difference between them in actual use.</li>
      <li>, fit perfectly in the device, have only used the green and blue (medium and fine) rollers so far.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews which were all positive and ordered them, however, they are nowhere near the quality of the true Emjoi brand refill rollers.</li>
      <li>This avoids dust getting ground into your carpets or spread about the room as much too.</li>
      <li>Came fast.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t use them yet-the tool doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy overall with the refills and the machine except that back bar that occasionally rubs the rollers....</li>
      <li>This one really works, better than two other brands I tried.  </li>
      <li>I also use the tooth brush always SOFT to clean the flat pedi file like paddles too</li>
      <li>I clean mine with a SOFT or EXTRA soft tooth brush after every use.</li>
      <li>just like new ones should.</li>
      <li>but they all seem to do the same exact job and results.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the cheaper ones give up the glue to the board sooner...but look for an extra soft or even ask you dentists office if they have the super soft or soft brushes next time you visit.</li>
      <li>I almost went with a cheaper brand because the rollers are larger and there is no annoying back support or elongated back side that gets in the way of the rollers when you press a bit too much or actually very little at times while in use.</li>

<li> Don&#x27;t Last Long after 1 or 2 uses you need to change the roller .</li>
<li> I have hard time tellng if there is any real difference in performance between the so called grit sizes.</li>
<li> Helps with my dry cracked heels.</li>
<li> I should have bought a corded unit because the battery version is so weak it takes forever to complete the job.</li>
<li> I just remove and brush down into the bath sink and then wash any dust on down the drain.</li>
<li> I also place a thick bath mat or towel on floor before using these in the machine.</li>
<li> What a waste of money!!!</li>
<li> Not happy with this purchase.  </li>
<li> For really bad heels, it takes a few times to remove all callus using the coarsest grit roller.</li>
<li> that is annoying...</li>

    <li> work great on callous no problems with delivery</li>
    <li> Works great with my Emjoi.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Last Long after 1 or 2 uses you need to change the roller . They should last longer I think it is a manufactures problem not the seller.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I needed. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fine as replacement heads. I have hard time tellng if there is any real difference in performance between the so called grit sizes. I clean mine with a SOFT or EXTRA soft tooth brush after every use. I just remove and brush down into the bath sink and then wash any dust on down the drain. I also place a thick bath mat or towel on floor before using these in the machine. This avoids dust getting ground into your carpets or spread about the room as much too. I almost went with a cheaper brand because the rollers are larger and there is no annoying back support or elongated back side that gets in the way of the rollers when you press a bit too much or actually very little at times while in use. But I didn&#x27;t and went with this and bought the gray so called man&#x27;s machine. The mini palm sized version...these rollers fit the longer versions too. Anyway I am satisfied with the rollers but see no difference between them in actual use. Maybe some looking at them but they all seem to do the same exact job and results. If you clean them with the tooth brush after every use you should get far more uses out of each roller than if you choose not to. My guess is like 2 maybe 3 times more use per roll. I also use the tooth brush always SOFT to clean the flat pedi file like paddles too and I had one of the better ones last me over 2 years. Sometimes the cheaper ones give up the glue to the board sooner...but look for an extra soft or even ask you dentists office if they have the super soft or soft brushes next time you visit. I&#x27;m happy overall with the refills and the machine except that back bar that occasionally rubs the rollers....that is annoying...and because of that the one star off.</li>
    <li> They were just as they were supposed to be. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I should have bought a corded unit because the battery version is so weak it takes forever to complete the job.</li>
    <li> Came fast. Work&#x27;s awesomely!</li>

    <li> Excellent!!!!!, I was so happen to get them on Amazon and the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use them yet-the tool doesn&#x27;t work very well so I won&#x27;t use them.  What a waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Works like a wonder!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and keeps my feet callus free between pedicures.</li>
    <li> the rollers work fine. just like new ones should.</li>

    <li> These work great, the variety of coarseness is what i was looking for. The price is great, much cheaper than the brand name. Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> Purchase is just as advertised</li>
    <li> This one really works, better than two other brands I tried.  For really bad heels, it takes a few times to remove all callus using the coarsest grit roller. Then once or twice a week I my feet a light going over to maintain the smooth feet.</li>
