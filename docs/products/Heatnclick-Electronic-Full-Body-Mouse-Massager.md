      <li>great for my back problems</li>
      <li>Very powerful for its size.</li>

      <li>Amazon, as usual, was perfect with order process, return process, refund, etc.</li>
      <li>When I saw this one on Amazon, I decided to buy it as a backup, in case anything ever happened to my original.  </li>
      <li>This Small Mouse Worked Wonderful On A Trip To South Padree Island</li>
      <li>The old model had a 9 volt battery which delivered a much more defined and energetic massage.  </li>
      <li>Good enough for 5 stars even with the battery issue.</li>
      <li>I borrowed the smaller version from a friend and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I am very well pleased.   </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Hi-Dow Mouse.  </li>
      <li>Luckily I had another 9 volt battery to put in it.</li>
      <li>This is the 3rd unit we&#x27;ve owned - used every day and for the price, it is an excellent item and holds up considering the constant use.</li>
      <li>Those can be more powerful, has more combination of massage types, comes with a digital LCD screen, or you can hook two pairs of leads to be used by more than one persons or for multiple body</li>
      <li>It is well worth the money</li>
      <li>It never occurred to me that you can have your own personal tension reliever gadget.  </li>
      <li>The product I purchased was almost, &amp;#34;Almost&amp;#34;, an exact copy of one I borrowed from a friend.</li>
      <li>I purchased 1 from a different seller 4 yrs ago and have really enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>After that my back got better</li>
      <li>This model doesn&#x27;t have as many modes, but it works just the same.</li>
      <li>Since the first time I used it I could felt the difference.</li>
      <li>Funny how none of the reviews first point out that this is an electrical stimulus machine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be more careful next time and read every detail to make sure I am buying what I think I am buying.</li>
      <li>It also is very similar to the massagers I&#x27;ve used in physical therapy, just more affordable!</li>
      <li>that we have set that straight</li>
      <li>So very relaxed.</li>
      <li>It was very helpful in relieving the stress I develop in this area.  </li>
      <li>Thanks For The Speedy Shipping&lt;br /&gt;Tami</li>
      <li>I tried the massage mouse and it really helped ease the pain.</li>
      <li>whole family is using it</li>
      <li>I checked it with the multi-meter and found that the main unit was defective.  </li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it for anyone needing massage.</li>
      <li>My patient has partial use of her right leg and no use of her right arm.</li>
      <li>After recipients purchased new batteries, 1 out of the 3 didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>I bought a new battery but the massage mouse doesn&#x27;t works.</li>
      <li>Sound weird, but that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
      <li>Love this little thing!  </li>
      <li>First of all, do not compare this with a real personal massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works fine however the pads do not last long.</li>
      <li>of course, you should seek professional medical advice first concerning one&#x27;s health.)cerning one&#x27;s health.)</li>
      <li>It helped enough that I could stand up straight and walk at a normal pace.</li>
      <li>Great for working out a tight back or tight legs</li>
      <li>Compared to what I had with the old model, I think this is junk.</li>
      <li>It actually feels like the real thing.</li>
      <li>Of course, what they hook me on is more of a professional instrument; but nevertheless, at least, for me the feeling is the same.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it didn&#x27;t work, but turns out the battery they sent with it was dead.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this to replace the original model and I am very disappointed.  The old model had a 9 volt battery which delivered a much more defined and energetic massage.  Also, this one does not work unless the &#x27;out&#x27; cord is turned around so that the thing won&#x27;t sit flat on a hard surface.  Compared to what I had with the old model, I think this is junk.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! The feet are sticky and it feels soooooo good on sore shoulders. At first I thought it didn&#x27;t work, but turns out the battery they sent with it was dead. Luckily I had another 9 volt battery to put in it. Good enough for 5 stars even with the battery issue.</li>
    <li> Love this little thing!  Very powerful for its size. It does the job!</li>
    <li> Amazon, as usual, was perfect with order process, return process, refund, etc. Absolutely no issue with Amazon. The problem was&lt;br /&gt;actually my mistake. The product I purchased was almost, &amp;#34;Almost&amp;#34;, an exact copy of one I borrowed from a friend. I loved his. However, this one was made by a different company and simply did not work at all. Easy to mistake the two items. I&#x27;ll be more careful next time and read every detail to make sure I am buying what I think I am buying.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this, I thought it was just another massage rip-off. Boy was I wrong! This little machine does a fantastic job of easing the pain of tight unhappy muscles. I suffer from chronic wide spread pain and this little mouse has helped so much. It is well worth the money and I highly recommend it for anyone needing massage. It actually feels like the real thing. It also is very similar to the massagers I&#x27;ve used in physical therapy, just more affordable! What more can I say--I love this mouse and am so happy I decided to take a chance and buy it. Thank you, Massage Mouse!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for another mouse we had that broke (we dropped it).  Love it.  Just wish it had a belt clip so you could clip it to your clothes when carrying it.  Great product!</li>
    <li> My wife bought this and had it for years and I just thought it was a gimmick. One day I twisted my back and it got worse day by day to where I could hardly walk. I was half stooped over and just kind of shuffled at a real slow pace. I tried the massage mouse and it really helped ease the pain. It helped enough that I could stand up straight and walk at a normal pace. So I stuck the mouse in my pocket and wore it to work for about three days. After that my back got better and I haven&#x27;t had any problems since. I was worried that 3 days of use might damage something but it didn&#x27;t.    I recommend this to anyone who suffers through back or muscle pain, which is just about everyone.</li>
    <li> Performed better than my expectations!!!</li>
    <li> I thought I was purchasing the small House Hi Dow Massager.  However, this will do fine.  I borrowed the smaller version from a friend and loved it.  This model doesn&#x27;t have as many modes, but it works just the same.</li>
    <li> Funny how none of the reviews first point out that this is an electrical stimulus machine. The mouse holds the 9-volt battery and you connect the wire from it to two pads with durable sticky gel like substance. Turn up the juice and your muscles contract and relax where you place the pads. The strength of the sensations can be controlled by the dial on the side of the mouse.    It works okay but definitely not the physical massage appliance that you may be looking for. If you are sharing this you may want to order the extra pads.</li>
    <li> I love this product.This is my second one.The only thing this time the battery was dead and I purchased a new 7 volt</li>
    <li> It arrived with a piece missing in the battery compartment but the instructions were poor, so I foolishly spent time troubleshooting until I realized that it was just not going to work.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd unit we&#x27;ve owned - used every day and for the price, it is an excellent item and holds up considering the constant use.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of these as gifts for Christmas and all 3 arrived with dead batteries. After recipients purchased new batteries, 1 out of the 3 didn&#x27;t work at all. Really disappointed in this product.  I purchased 1 from a different seller 4 yrs ago and have really enjoyed it. This was suggested to me by my physician for tension.  Just sorry it didn&#x27;t arrive as advertised.</li>
    <li> This Small Mouse Worked Wonderful On A Trip To South Padree Island Over The 4th Of July.&lt;br /&gt;My Husband Was Able To Walk The Beach In Very Little Pain Something He Would Have Never Been Able&lt;br /&gt;To Do Without It!!! His Back Is Giving Him Lots Of Trouble, So This Gave Some Releif Till We Can Figure Out What Is Going On. Thanks For The Speedy Shipping&lt;br /&gt;Tami (ps) I Use It also After A Long Day Of Work, Lifting And Helping Pt&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I am a nurse and was very disappointed in this item and the seller. Unable to return it due to poor seller response by email still waiting for the seller to email me the address to send item back for refund, a month later...... Not safe for a child to use.</li>
    <li> My son got one of these from his fiancee and I was hooked. Hard to believe this little device can mimic a personal massage. Definitely worth the small amount of money!!</li>
    <li> Sure does make my sore muscles feel better.</li>
    <li> This is my second Massage Mouse.  If you use it right, it makes your muscles relax and you will feel so awesome.  So very relaxed.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for about 3 years now and it works awesome. I had tennis elbow and went to therapy but even after I have pain once in a while then I tried this mouse that works almost the same as what my chiro used. Since the first time I used it I could felt the difference.Even my husband has used it for his carpal tunnel.The pads have lasted a long time too.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome!  Works just like it is supposed to.  It was a little weird at first, but I got used to it quickly.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I had a tight muscle and my sister had one of these and loaned it to me.  It worked wonders, so I purchased one for myself.  We have used it in my family for tight muscles from playing sports, exercising, etc.</li>
    <li> First of all, do not compare this with a real personal massage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that we have set that straight, let me tell you about this product.  This unassuming, cheap looking plastic, that is called a massage mouse is simply amazing. Have you been to a chiropractor? I have. I went to a chiro for 6 months after ruining my back when we moved 5 years ago.  They strap to me a similar gadget on my back with two leads.  Electric impulses sent through the wires which cause my muscles to tingle.  I lay there for 20 minutes and then send my insurance a bill for a hundred bucks.  Of course, what they hook me on is more of a professional instrument; but nevertheless, at least, for me the feeling is the same. It is extremely relaxing.  It never occurred to me that you can have your own personal tension reliever gadget.  While using this, I listen to my favorite soothing music and it is just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is made by Hi-Dow.  They have several models and this mouse is the least inexpensive.  It comes with a 9 volt battery, 2 pairs of pads (1 big that is shaped like little hands and a smaller egg-shaped pads), the wires, manual, the mouse, and ears.  The ears has no use at all except to make it look like more of a mouse.  It says in the manual that it can be used as a document holder. Sound weird, but that&#x27;s OK.  Their more expensive models can range to 100 to 300$ and you can see them being offered on those little carts on the malls.  Those can be more powerful, has more combination of massage types, comes with a digital LCD screen, or you can hook two pairs of leads to be used by more than one persons or for multiple body locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has 3 modes including a combination cycle of massages. It has a small on/off switch that also set the intensity of the electric current.  1 hour automatic turn-off.  If you have body aches and muscle pains, this gadget can work wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(But of course, you should seek professional medical advice first concerning one&#x27;s health.)cerning one&#x27;s health.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on a recommendation from a friend who claimed he walked around with the mouse in a shirt pocket and kept it running for a half hour at a time connected to his sore shoulder, back and arm.  I admit I was skeptical until I tried it.  It definitely gets your sore muscles jumping and does leave them feeling relaxed.  I think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> excellent product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> It is so nice and effective. Air travel will never be the same for me! No more pain in the neck!</li>
    <li> My husband is liking this, so am I. wish the cords were a little longer. whole family is using it</li>
    <li> works well but the pads don&#x27;t last long enough</li>
    <li> I purchased the mouse massage after being in Las Vegas.  I went to an oxygen bar and they used it on my shoulder area.  It was very helpful in relieving the stress I develop in this area.  At this sight they wanted $75 for it.  I knew I would be able to get it at a better price on the internet.  When returning home I checked and I was able.  I am very well pleased.   Thank you.  Sincerely,  Barbara Z Chiariello</li>
    <li> Helps aches and pains</li>
    <li> great for my back problems</li>
    <li> I take care of a stroke pateient in her home. Her stroke took place 3 years ago. She was in a rehabilitation center for 2 years and in assisted living for a year. A month ago she returned home and in my care. We are now on our second physical therapist. My patient has partial use of her right leg and no use of her right arm. Shes had no feeling in the arm since the stroke. We do different simple exercises in the home, do some massage manualy and w a textured ball. I was loaned the massage mouse after I discussed with someone that the therapist mentioned the nerves needed to be stimulated in the affected limbs in order to even consider them working again. Today I brought the device wit us to get approval from her therapist prior to using it. We put the pads on her arm and gave it a try. It was visibly working, and she could feel it. We saw movement in her arm and hand that before today and the past 3 years was impossible. The fact that she could feel in that same arm was remarkable. Tears of joy. Road to recovery thanks to this amazing device.</li>
    <li> Great product holds up well does what it said it would.</li>
    <li> It is announce with a USB charger but It&#x27;s not true. It comes with a dead 9 V battery. I bought a new battery but the massage mouse doesn&#x27;t works.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works like a charm.  Similar to muscle stimulation therapy I get at the chiropractor.</li>
    <li> Works fine however the pads do not last long. Need to supply more pads with the unit  I would recommend to any friends.</li>
    <li> Great for working out a tight back or tight legs</li>
    <li> Massage mouse didn&#x27;t work out of the box. Dead on arrival.  Its a good product as I have used others but this one was defective.  Even the batteries that came with it were dead.  I checked it with the multi-meter and found that the main unit was defective.  Paddle connections and wires OK.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these Hi-Dow Massagers about 12 or 15 years ago and have used in on a weekly basis all that time.  When I saw this one on Amazon, I decided to buy it as a backup, in case anything ever happened to my original.  HOW OFTEN DO YOU HAVE A PRODUCT THAT RELIEVES PAIN SO EFFORTLESSLY AND LASTS MORE THAN A DECADE?  Well, the Hi-Dow Massage Mouse does! I&#x27;ve given these as gifts to friends in pain and they also have found them to be incredibly effective.  I keep it in the box it comes in to use as a safe case whenever I&#x27;m traveling.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Hi-Dow Mouse.  If you&#x27;re in pain from arthritis or muscle spasms, don&#x27;t hesitate.  This is the solution!</li>
