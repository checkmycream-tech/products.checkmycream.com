      <li>, very healthy glow/color!</li>
      <li>It has great coverage</li>
      <li>Great bronzer-makes my skin feel and look</li>
      <li>So, I guess it is good.</li>
      <li>Awesome product highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>The texture is lovely, it&#x27;s good for my skin, and maybe if I ever get a tan, I will use this.</li>
      <li>This primer along with the face Brightener gives my complexion a nice look.</li>
      <li>a lot more, because it does give better coverage,</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps it helps your moisturizer absorb better.</li>
      <li>Love Colorscience products.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Wanted to love this product but had an allergic reaction and had to stop.</li>
      <li>and I love the color on my olive skin.  </li>
      <li>I love this primer and have been use it for 3 years.</li>
      <li>I like it because it very lightly bronzes my face and goes on ultra smoothly.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and noticeably lessens variations in skin color on my face.</li>
      <li>Makes it easy to put on cream blush.</li>
      <li>Coverage is great, all day smooth and clean holistic fragrance...not a perfum smell like similar products.</li>
      <li>I love the way Wild to Mild feels on my skin!</li>
      <li>so this subtle cover and color is just perfect.</li>
      <li>Unless you have super tan skin already with a redish hue, this is not the product for you.  </li>
      <li>It covers beautiful and all I add is a little powder over it.</li>
      <li>While both are called bronzers, the other product is more of a tinted moisturizer, while this is more of a true bronzer.  </li>
      <li>I love Colorscience Bronzer because it smooths the skin and gives it a natural sheen.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend their clear version as the texture of the primer was actually lovely.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had more compliments on my skin in my 60&#x27;s than when I was young</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve realized that I don&#x27;t need that much when I&#x27;m not wearing a lot of makeup (special occasions)</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen, light bronzer for just a bit of brightening color, especially if your facial sunscreen has the kind of sunscreen that is a little white-ish on your skin.  </li>
      <li>and I love everything about it, especially how it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
      <li>I prefer the Mild to Wild product from this brand, but that&#x27;s just because of the color.  </li>
      <li>Really evens out the tone of my melanoma.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s due to Colorscience products.</li>
      <li>Less is more after all.</li>
      <li>I have used it for years and would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist told me that regardless of SPF sunscreens need to be reapplied every 80 minutes in normal day to day wear.  </li>
      <li>My only doubt whis the one I bought right now</li>
      <li>, is regarding if this is exactly the same.</li>
      <li>but it goes on silky smooth, extremely light and the color is very subtle.  </li>
      <li>I compared the old one with the new one (the one bought here)</li>
      <li>The small bottle is good for purse for frequent applicatins thru out the day, not a large bulky container!  </li>
      <li>I will re-pos as soon as I finishe the old one and  </li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly, even distribution is no problem, a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>in face high spf sunscreens makes my face look grey.  </li>
      <li>flawless-people always comment on&lt;br /&gt;the smooth texture of my face-I use it everyday!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was recommended at my dermatologist office.  It has great coverage and I love the color on my olive skin.  Plus much less expensive buying from Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big Colorscience fan for at least 10 years. I love the way Wild to Mild feels on my skin! I use this on a daily basis in combination with the California Girl loose powder, or I&#x27;ll use the Medium shade of the SPF 50 loose powder. I&#x27;ve been wearing &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; foundations (Giorgio Armani) a lot more, because it does give better coverage, but I&#x27;ve realized that I don&#x27;t need that much when I&#x27;m not wearing a lot of makeup (special occasions)</li>
    <li> The color of this product is absolutely awful.  It&#x27;s sort of the color of bricks.  Unless you have super tan skin already with a redish hue, this is not the product for you.  Not sure why the Colorescience decided to go with this shade of bronze for their primer.  I would recommend their clear version as the texture of the primer was actually lovely.  Wish I could return this product as I am definitely not going to use it.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen, light bronzer for just a bit of brightening color, especially if your facial sunscreen has the kind of sunscreen that is a little white-ish on your skin.  And yes I layer sun protection, especially on my face because I&#x27;ve had malignant melanomas removed.(sadly I was a former sun worshipper.) I&#x27;m olive complexion so the white-ish (zinc oxide maybe) in face high spf sunscreens makes my face look grey.  This product brightens my face, very healthy glow/color! When yuo squirt itout of the bottle it might look like heavy foundation but it goes on silky smooth, extremely light and the color is very subtle.  I personally would not use this anywhere other than my face.  My dermatologist told me that regardless of SPF sunscreens need to be reapplied every 80 minutes in normal day to day wear.  The small bottle is good for purse for frequent applicatins thru out the day, not a large bulky container!  100% recommend this one!, (and I don&#x27;t give a lot of 100%)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it made my face breakout.  Another very expensive mistake at the bottom of my make-up drawer.</li>
    <li> Did not have a color spectrum on container as before, was darker and less bronzey</li>
    <li> It ran out sooner than the other ones I had purchased!</li>
    <li> Feels like silk for your face! I have used it for years and would highly recommend. Can be worn by itself or under makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very pale, pale lady who will probably have a red nose in old age.  This color was not ideal for my paleface.  I prefer the Mild to Wild product from this brand, but that&#x27;s just because of the color.  While both are called bronzers, the other product is more of a tinted moisturizer, while this is more of a true bronzer.  The texture is lovely, it&#x27;s good for my skin, and maybe if I ever get a tan, I will use this.</li>
    <li> I wear this instead of makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, no breakouts, doesn&#x27;t look like makeup.  Not super bronz-y, but makes me look healthier in the long, horrible winter months.  My skin is oily, so something that evens out tone without sliding off is hard to find.</li>
    <li> I love Colorscience Bronzer because it smooths the skin and gives it a natural sheen.  I&#x27;ve had more compliments on my skin in my 60&#x27;s than when I was young and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s due to Colorscience products.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this product but had an allergic reaction and had to stop.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Frankly, I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34;. Perhaps it helps your moisturizer absorb better. I like it because it very lightly bronzes my face and goes on ultra smoothly. I don&#x27;t like wearing foundation so this subtle cover and color is just perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It goes on very smoothly, even distribution is no problem, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this primer and have been use it for 3 years. My only doubt whis the one I bought right now, is regarding if this is exactly the same. Perhaps the bottle sticker changed a little (a minimum). I compared the old one with the new one (the one bought here) and they looked almost the same. So, I guess it is good. I will re-pos as soon as I finishe the old one and  start using this one. In terms of the cost and shipping, it was excellent!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple years. it is the only thing I use as face makeup. It goes on easily and noticeably lessens variations in skin color on my face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use primers but read reviews on this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It covers beautiful and all I add is a little powder over it. Less is more after all. Can&#x27;t wait to see how it hold up in the summer.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer-makes my skin feel and look flawless-people always comment on&lt;br /&gt;the smooth texture of my face-I use it everyday!!!</li>
    <li> love this product you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I love everything about it, especially how it makes my skin look and feel. I was paying a fortune for it and decided to look on Amazon. I saved 20 dollars on it!</li>
    <li> Coverage is great, all day smooth and clean holistic fragrance...not a perfum smell like similar products.</li>
    <li> Awesome product highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Love Colorscience products. This primer along with the face Brightener gives my complexion a nice look.</li>
    <li> Really evens out the tone of my melanoma. Makes it easy to put on cream blush. Would buy again.</li>
