<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After the first use, I thought, &amp;#34;Oh no! This is going to make my skin SO DRY!&amp;#34;  But it wasn&#x27;t so bad.  The next time I used it, there was no problem at all.  I love that it is basic and unscented.  Works great on face and body.</li>
    <li> My mother has been using this product for years and swears by it,it takes all her make up off nicely and her skin looks fantastic for her 79 years of age,she will not try anything else and is glad that Amazon has it for where she use to get it,they no longer sell. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I started using Basis when I was 12 and I&#x27;ve been using Basis soap ever since. My skin makes me look 10 years younger than 65. I started because I noticed that my father, a doctor, always used Basis Soap. Why? His answers: He washed alot so he needed a gentle soap to prevent drying out. His face was very oily so he needed a soap that cleared away the oil. He had a lot of allergies so he wanted to avoid getting rashes. And finally, for the sake of his patients, he wanted to avoid fragrence. I travel a lot more than my father and take Basis with me at all times. It works well in many different types of water. Some years ago I was looking at the soap box and read it differently: B-AS-IS. The basis of life is to be as you are. Simple honest soap.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful.  I&#x27;m 32 and have been washing my face with this soap since I was 14.  As a young adolescent, I had acne, my mother also had it so her dermatologist recommended basis...well I used it also assuming my mother and I both have sensitive skin and I never had to worry about acne again.  Unfortunately, none of the stores around my area sell it!:(</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin this might be the soap for you to try. I ordered it on line because it was not available locally. This was a fair price for the item and I can recommend ordering this from Amazon.</li>
    <li> An optometrist recommended this soap. It&#x27;s so much better than the fancy ten to fifteen dollar cleansers I used to buy. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted all of that money!  I normally have dry skin and am never entirely blemish free (especially near my temples or at my jaw line). This basis soap really helps minimize any blemishes I do get. And, notably, my faces doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after using it.    By the way, if you try to buy this in stores and can&#x27;t find it, check with the pharmacist. I don&#x27;t know why but it&#x27;s often not on shelves but in the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been highly allergic and I&#x27;ve used this product for years with great results.</li>
    <li> SUPER drying! And I have oily skin. I threw it out after the second use.</li>
    <li> Basis bar soap for sensitive skin is wonderful for anyone with dry skin too.  I have very dry and sensitive sky and was told by my doctor to use this soap.  I have been using it for about two years and I LOVE it.  I recommend it to everyone, really because it doesn&#x27;t leave a film.  It&#x27;s also good for anyone who is allergic to perfumes because it has no smell.  It gets you clean and you will feel fresh.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make me breakout, but it did leave my skin feeling tight after use. This also stings my eyes, so not so good for removing eye makeup. Also, it&#x27;s difficult for me to open my eyes to reach for the faucet handles. Still in search for an affordable facial cleanser without sulfates or parabens that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling taut or hurt when it gets into my eyes.</li>
    <li> Basis soap for sensitive skin is wonderful for people who react to harsh additives.  While using other soaps, I found that any residue would give me eczema.  I have used Basis Sensitive skin for many years now, and have never had a problem.</li>
    <li> I decided that as I am getting older, (age 42) I want something very gentle to cleanse my face, and I found it in this little bar of basis.  I read reviews about the bad smell, but I don&#x27;t smell much of anything when the bar is wet or when it is dry.  I have been using for about 2 weeks and had had no adverse reactions on my combination skin, and actually the dryness on my forehead is much better, but maybe that&#x27;s due to the warmer weather, I don&#x27;t know.  I do know that I will be buying this again.  It&#x27;s simple and perfect and I love that it has chamomile in it.  I see they have a vitamin bar as well maybe I&#x27;ll try too.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law, a cosmotologist, recommended this soap 20 yrs ago but it took me that long to believe her. Being one of those people who has to try everything I have tried dozens of soaps and I find that Basis is the most gentle for washing very dry hands and legs especially in the Winter.</li>
    <li> The only soap i have been able to constantly use for the last 27 yrs.  Tried others but always broke out in rash.  Even the sensitive brands.  Hope this product never goes away</li>
    <li> It arrived on time very good soap it refreshes skin soothes well smell is good neither greasy nor over-drying the reason m giving it 3 stars &amp; nt five cos i did get 1 pimple while during its use though not severe &amp; its not effective on pre-existing acne or acne scars but still i will recommend it as it cleans well when u wash your face giving the feeling tht u r deeply cleaned</li>
    <li> I love this soap for my dry sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Basis soap was prescribed to me as a child for dealing with excezema and I have used it ever since.   It is the gentlest soap I know and I use no other.  I am also so glad to find it on Amazon.com since it is always such a hassle to find it locally--the drugstores will add it then deselect it.   What a pain!</li>
    <li> This soap is good for sensitive skin, but can tend to leave the skin feeling tight and dry.  Maybe it would be better for someone who doesn&#x27;t have the dryness issue already?</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Soap recommended by my doctor.</li>
    <li> Gentle, thorough cleansing for dry, sensitive skin.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
