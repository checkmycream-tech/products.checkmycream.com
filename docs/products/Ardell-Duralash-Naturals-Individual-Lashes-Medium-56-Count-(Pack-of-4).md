      <li>If you add mascara and eyeliner they are beautiful long lashes.</li>

      <li>super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Great came early and got exactly what&#x27;s in the picture</li>

      <li>get ready for people complimenting your lashes :)</li>
      <li>Nice product for a natural look...</li>
      <li>The natural Ardell are perfect for the person who wants to lengthen their lashes on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>You can make these look so much more natural than a full set of lashes.  </li>
      <li>I used a set of tweezers to apply them, and filled my lashes as much as I wanted</li>
      <li>I apply with tweezers daily and the look amazing and stay on until you take them off.</li>
      <li>Love these with clear glue.  </li>
      <li>I keep hoping that what I order and what they send will be right for once.</li>
      <li>So much easier to put on than a full lash.</li>
      <li>Very upset!</li>
      <li>The only way they could be better IMHO is if they were truly permanent</li>
      <li>Really great for when you want extra oomph to your look, without looking like a drag queen.</li>
      <li>I really like these lashes but it would have been better if they came with different lengths.</li>
      <li>It looks natural but you have to you several in area to make it look like your own lashes.</li>
      <li>I can make them as natural or bold as I want.</li>
      <li>These fell off a little more quickly than the knotted version.  </li>
      <li>There is too much adhesive holding the lashes in the trays.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Takes me 5 mins to pop two on the outer corner of each eye, and really opens up the eyes.</li>
      <li>They looked good the first night and now they look clumpy and uneven, two days later.</li>
      <li>I did order other the company and the quality much better</li>
      <li>If you can get past the irritation it is good for not pulling out or damaging your natural lashes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true, they are on there pretty tight</li>
      <li>LOVE these little lashes!  </li>
      <li>Use on a regular basis and it is much cheaper than you can find in the beauty supply stores</li>
      <li>so they look really natural.  </li>
      <li>I really wish that they had some very short ones included with the others for your lashes closer to your nose.  </li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s not such a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;After some UTube time and a little practice I absolutely love these lashes.</li>
      <li>I bought the clear ardell glue for individual lashes to use with these.</li>
      <li>I use the same brand of glue (lasts a week) and just replace the ones that fall off ( because of natural shedding cycle of lashes)</li>
      <li>look natural and can stay on a long time.  </li>

<li> look natural and can stay on a long time.  </li>
<li> The lengths are also not consistent with Ardell brand; too long Medium and too short Short.</li>
<li> the picture i ordered off of is PINK background on lashes what they keep sending me is different,</li>
<li> I waited to open them until my other eyelashes were all gone.  </li>
<li> And if one comes loose I just replace it.</li>
<li> I can only wear the black</li>
<li> These are not real ardell lashes.</li>
<li> THEY ARE NOT REAL ARDELL</li>
<li> If they are not going to send the one on the site that has pink back\tray take it off the web!</li>
<li> i am a make up artist and have been working with ardell for your and other products you find at drugstores.  </li>
<li> Ive read some of the other reviews about the difficulty getting them off of the packaging.</li>
<li> They last about a week or two depending on application and how hard you are on them.</li>
<li> But overall, I am a beginner and these are hard to apply.</li>
<li> These are not worth the money as you do not get what is advertised.  </li>
<li> For the lashes applied closer to my nose, i just used scissors to trim the length down.</li>
<li> (although they say medium) and when you pick them up with tweezers they break in half.  </li>
<li> so I ordered the pack of 4 Medium Black Eyelashes.  </li>
<li> So I opened them today and noticed they sent me the brown color instead of the black.  </li>
<li> I sleep in my lashes and can usually go 3-4 days without replacing any if I am careful in the shower as well.  </li>
<li> use these with the dark lashtite glue!</li>
<li> These work well for everyday use.  </li>
<li> You&#x27;ll probably even destroy a few even after you think you have the hang of it.</li>
<li> I put 3 on each eye everyday.  </li>
<li> these lashes are some sort of fake they are not long at all</li>
<li> and I trust Ardell products, which I have used in the past.</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t hard to put on.</li>
<li> False advertising.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a bit obsessed with these.</li>
<li> Maybe I bought the wrong pack.</li>
<li> so the brown color is useless to me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these. They&#x27;re the best individual lashes money can buy!</li>
    <li> Work great, bulk packaging makes for a good value.</li>
    <li> These babies are so easy to place, much easier than a full strip of lashes! Really great for when you want extra oomph to your look, without looking like a drag queen. Takes me 5 mins to pop two on the outer corner of each eye, and really opens up the eyes. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have had extensions and use Latisse but these create a great 1950s sleepy eye or 1960s full upper lash. I apply with tweezers daily and the look amazing and stay on until you take them off.</li>
    <li> There is too much adhesive holding the lashes in the trays. This effectively causes most lashes to pull out of usable shape when removed from the tray.  The lengths are also not consistent with Ardell brand; too long Medium and too short Short. I ended up giving them to my Savannah to play with.</li>
    <li> I paid for the advertised 4 packs &amp; received only 1!  For over $11 - I was ripped off!  Very upset!</li>
    <li> These allege to be &amp;#34;knot-free&amp;#34; and in fact they are not. False advertising.</li>
    <li> I love my lashes, received all four on the date you said. The cost was cheaper then the store price. I will order more when I run out. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the look and find these easier to apply than strip lashes. They last about a week or two depending on application and how hard you are on them. If you use lash tite and apply to lashes instead if to skin they last longer. But they can also be more difficult to remove. I like to use the remover in this situation but that does sting sometimes. If you can get past the irritation it is good for not pulling out or damaging your natural lashes. A note for those of you who cook a lot. I have experienced the heat from the oven melting these into something resembling deformed spider legs.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal....so I ordered the pack of 4 Medium Black Eyelashes.  I waited to open them until my other eyelashes were all gone.  So I opened them today and noticed they sent me the brown color instead of the black.  I tried to find a way to contact the seller but there was no option.  So I guess I am stuck with these.  I can only wear the black so the brown color is useless to me.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It stays on with the lashtite through multiple washes.  It&#x27;s so easy to upkeep.  If one falls off, then I just stick one on in its place.  I&#x27;m so glad I discovered these!  I no longer have to spend $100/week to keep my lashes looking full.</li>
    <li> It looks natural but you have to you several in area to make it look like your own lashes.</li>
    <li> Great fit. Great shipping</li>
    <li> I had never used these before, but after a couple YouTube videos I am now a pro! Okay, not a pro, but I manage! I use the same brand of glue (lasts a week) and just replace the ones that fall off ( because of natural shedding cycle of lashes)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit obsessed with these. So much easier to put on than a full lash.</li>
    <li> Great came early and got exactly what&#x27;s in the picture</li>
    <li> I love everything about these eyelashes, they are the perfect length and I never need wear mascara while wearing these lashes. I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone and everyone!!! You get four packs for $10 which is an amazing deal!!!  Please buy they are absolutely incredible!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> LOVE these little lashes!  You can make these look so much more natural than a full set of lashes.  I always purchase them in \\&quot;Short\\&quot;.  I really wish that they had some very short ones included with the others for your lashes closer to your nose.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> use for video and photo shoots or for any venue.  look natural and can stay on a long time.  super easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Have not used product yet, The price was great and I trust Ardell products, which I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> these are easy to apply, knotfree appearance looks more real than the knotted ones. i recommend these to starters and to those who want to do it the easy way.</li>
    <li> The natural Ardell are perfect for the person who wants to lengthen their lashes on a regular basis. They have no knots on the end so they look really natural.  I sleep in my lashes and can usually go 3-4 days without replacing any if I am careful in the shower as well.  I just add lashes as I lose them.  If you don&#x27;t add mascara you can wear them for days or more.  If you add mascara and eyeliner they are beautiful long lashes.</li>
    <li> Ive read some of the other reviews about the difficulty getting them off of the packaging. It&#x27;s true, they are on there pretty tight and you do have to be carefull pulling them off for use. You&#x27;ll probably even destroy a few even after you think you have the hang of it. But that&#x27;s not such a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;After some UTube time and a little practice I absolutely love these lashes. I don&#x27;t have to deal with mascara. I can make them as natural or bold as I want. And if one comes loose I just replace it. What&#x27;s not to love?  The only way they could be better IMHO is if they were truly permanent</li>
    <li> very difficult to use</li>
    <li> Nice product for a natural look...I always get a lot of nice comments from ladies whenever I wear them. :-)</li>
    <li> So long as you put them on correctly they turn out perfect everytime!!</li>
    <li> Item as described and they work perfectly for me. Take practice getting used to but they work.</li>
    <li> I prefer the knotted version for &amp;#34;under the lash&amp;#34; application. These fell off a little more quickly than the knotted version.  But a great price versus the local drug strore.</li>
    <li> Ardel lashes are the best</li>
    <li> I thought these were the ones with the knot but they were not. I find the kitted ones easier to apply. Ordered on subscribe and save so I cancelled all future shipments.</li>
    <li> These are not worth the money as you do not get what is advertised.  They advertise a 4 pack but only 1 pack was delivered.</li>
    <li> I really like these lashes but it would have been better if they came with different lengths. Maybe I bought the wrong pack. But overall, I am a beginner and these are hard to apply. I watched a few you tube videos and feel like I used too much glue. I bought the clear ardell glue for individual lashes to use with these. They definitely did not come off like the regular glue you use with the strip lashes, but are a pain if you have to remove them. I would recommend for someone who has the patience to learn to apply these properly. For the lashes applied closer to my nose, i just used scissors to trim the length down. They looked good the first night and now they look clumpy and uneven, two days later. It was also impossible for me to wear sunglasses with these lashes because of the length.</li>
    <li> what I ordered by picture and what was delivered is not the same.  the picture i ordered off of is PINK background on lashes what they keep sending me is different, yes it says same thing but trust me its not the same I keep hoping that what I order and what they send will be right for once. If they are not going to send the one on the site that has pink back\tray take it off the web!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t hard to put on. I used a set of tweezers to apply them, and filled my lashes as much as I wanted</li>
    <li> Love these with clear glue.  I put 3 on each eye everyday.  Don&#x27;t even need mascara which no matter what formula I use it always is under my eyes making me look beat.  Once you get the hang of it, it takes about the same time as applying mascara.</li>
    <li> Use on a regular basis and it is much cheaper than you can find in the beauty supply stores</li>
    <li> use these with the dark lashtite glue! its the only way i will do my own lashes! get ready for people complimenting your lashes :)</li>
    <li> Perfect combination of a natural yet ready to strike a pose look, Often get asked if they are naturally my lashes.</li>
    <li> Last for weeks.Better than mascara!</li>
    <li> The quality very poor. The minute I put glue on all the lash fall apart. I did order other the company and the quality much better</li>
    <li> These work well for everyday use.  Be sure to use lash tite adhesive to put on and lash free adhesive remover to take off lashes.</li>
    <li> These are not real ardell lashes. i am a make up artist and have been working with ardell for your and other products you find at drugstores.  these lashes are some sort of fake they are not long at all (although they say medium) and when you pick them up with tweezers they break in half.  DO NOT BUY THESE FROM THIS SELLER.  THEY ARE NOT REAL ARDELL</li>
    <li> Love them work great!!</li>
