### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>Great dryer and price.</li>
      <li>Great dryer&lt;br</li>
      <li>The difference in the sound is that this one is kind of &amp;#34;throaty&amp;#34; instead of a high-pitched whine.</li>
      <li>, I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also pretty - mine came in a bright aqua color.  </li>
      <li>Great hairdryer, quiet as promised</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>very quite, good production and shipping is fast as well</li>
      <li>Nice looking, but is a tad too loud.</li>
      <li>Not really quiet, but better than most.</li>
      <li>The quiet feature is the most important to us.  </li>
      <li>This is a good dryer and is indeed pretty quiet, even on the high setting.</li>
      <li>Also the color is really pretty and the heat is just right.</li>
      <li>What arrived was a bright blue one, which sounds minor and we do need a hairdryer</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the dryer a couple of weeks, but it dries my hair as well and as quickly as the old one did, and maybe better since my old dryer didn&#x27;t have the ionic technology.</li>
      <li>I just think Amazon needs to be more careful with their images/what they are sending.</li>
      <li>Quiet blow dryer; only the buttons are positioned that they are too easy to switch off when you are blowing drying.</li>
      <li>This was a good hairdryer, although the vents were impossible to clean, lending itself to a shortened life span.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time it happened, I had something similar happen with a balance ball chair.</li>
      <li>The hairdryer is good, but I had specifically ordered this in the hot pink to replace my daughter&#x27;s hair dryer that had been broken.</li>
      <li>But I bought this for the quiet noise so everything else don&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Dries fast and quietly!</li>
      <li>If you get to the fine print you&#x27;ll see that this Revlon dryer is made by Helen of Troy and the other one is actually made by Revlon.</li>
      <li>Has two switches; one for high or low heat, the other for on / off and fan speed (high or low).</li>
      <li>It is much quieter than the average hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>The position of cool blast is also a little harder to use.</li>

    <li> It is quieter than a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; hair dryer but don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking it is quiet. It is a hairdryer after all. The difference in the sound is that this one is kind of &amp;#34;throaty&amp;#34; instead of a high-pitched whine. It almost sounds as though the fan is loose and rattling a bit because it is set vertically in a sideways direction (the air flows side-to-side instead of from the front-to-back of the dryer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you will find that this version - although marketed under the same stock number as the other listing for it - is less expensive. If you get to the fine print you&#x27;ll see that this Revlon dryer is made by Helen of Troy and the other one is actually made by Revlon. Revlon provides a warranty and Helen of Troy does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had the dryer a couple of weeks, but it dries my hair as well and as quickly as the old one did, and maybe better since my old dryer didn&#x27;t have the ionic technology. I don&#x27;t know if I believe in ions, but my hair seems to like it.</li>
    <li> Great dryer&lt;br /&gt;Dries fast and quietly!</li>
    <li> This dryer has all the features that are wanted.  The quiet feature is the most important to us.  Unfortunately it is being returned for a refund.  It sounds like a small piece of plastic is rattling around inside the device.  A change in noise does take place as the loose piece moves around.  The noise isn&#x27;t that bothersome but the concern that the loose piece may damage the motor or create a fire hazard is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying a second one now.  Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t have the same problem.</li>
    <li> Quiet blow dryer; only the buttons are positioned that they are too easy to switch off when you are blowing drying. The position of cool blast is also a little harder to use. But I bought this for the quiet noise so everything else don&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer, quiet as promised, I love it. Could be a little smaller though.</li>
    <li> Nice looking, but is a tad too loud.</li>
    <li> Has two switches; one for high or low heat, the other for on / off and fan speed (high or low). Not really quiet, but better than most. Flat nozzle can be removed, leaving a pointier nozzle.</li>
    <li> Great dryer and price.</li>
    <li> The last one finally quit after about 5 years, so I immediately replaced it with the same one.  This dryer is very quiet and still puts out a lot of air.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Very quiet!</li>
    <li> quieter than other hair dryers i have used</li>
    <li> This is actually not that quiet but if you put it on low is seems quiet compared to other dryers. Also the color is really pretty and the heat is just right.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  It takes longer to dry my long, thin hair than I thought it would, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> The color is wrong. But it works.</li>
    <li> I needed a quiet dryer so I did wake others in the morning and this is really quiet</li>
    <li> This order was disappointing. The hairdryer is good, but I had specifically ordered this in the hot pink to replace my daughter&#x27;s hair dryer that had been broken. What arrived was a bright blue one, which sounds minor and we do need a hairdryer so it&#x27;s not worth returning, but she specifically picked this one out. I just think Amazon needs to be more careful with their images/what they are sending. This isn&#x27;t the first time it happened, I had something similar happen with a balance ball chair. I didn&#x27;t notice the color difference until months later because I&#x27;d been waiting until my office was redone to set it up.... and by then it was too late to return.</li>
    <li> This is a good dryer and is indeed pretty quiet, even on the high setting. But if you thought you were getting a fuschia one, you won&#x27;t. It&#x27;s metallic blue (if that matters to you).</li>
    <li> very quite, good production and shipping is fast as well</li>
    <li> It is much quieter than the average hair dryer.  I have been concerned about hearing loss and went on the hunt for a quieter hair dryer.  Although it sounds like it has less power, it doesn&#x27;t take me any longer to dry my hair than before I had this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s also pretty - mine came in a bright aqua color.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> This was a good hairdryer, although the vents were impossible to clean, lending itself to a shortened life span.  Disappointed it did not come with a diffuser, probably will not purchase another one.  Good luck!</li>
