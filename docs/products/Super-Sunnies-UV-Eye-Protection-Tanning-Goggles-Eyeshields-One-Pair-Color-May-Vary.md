      <li>These are fine.  </li>
      <li>Eye protection goggles are comfortable and easy to put on.  </li>
      <li>But this product seems fine to me.</li>
      <li>Cheap and flimsy.</li>
      <li>These are cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I also like the fit &amp; coverage that they give me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These goggles are cheap.</li>
      <li>Light comes in through the sides.</li>
      <li>I ordered these as part of a 8 week LED light treatment</li>
      <li>The light is NOT shielded from my eyes.</li>
      <li>goggles are cheap.</li>
      <li>These things were really cheap plastic material.  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;ll fit over my eyes.  </li>
      <li>so that is important to me.    </li>
      <li>I feel like they are not that protective since all that light shines through.  </li>
      <li>they are comfortable to use, I like them</li>
      <li>I had to squint my eyes in order to bunch up the skin and block out the light.  </li>
      <li>They are comfortable on your eyes.  </li>
      <li>These work well and are super cheap.</li>
      <li>I thought it might just be my face at first, but after letting two of my friends borrow and use them they experienced the same problem.</li>
      <li>However, that is the only thing good about it.</li>
      <li>I got it on time and really quick</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t get any kind of case, either, as another reviewer apparently did.    </li>
      <li>My regular pair of sunglasses do better!  </li>
      <li>Great price and definitely worth a few bucks to save your eyes.  </li>
      <li>These UV eye protection gears are extremely useful</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not worth the price or effort.</li>
      <li>The goggles are quality, and are as good as any other I have used.  </li>
      <li>The eye pieces are sharp and dig into the eyes yet do not do a good job of completing a seal which means quite a bit of sunlight still gets through.</li>
      <li>These tanning goggles did not sit on my eyes right.</li>
      <li>Not shaped right for my face</li>
      <li>A cheap pair of sunglasses polarized from a brick and mortar store available for just a few dollars do a better job of protection.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They do exactly what they are meant to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I have any problems since I&#x27;ve only used it for about two weeks, but so far I&#x27;m very satisfied with these goggles.</li>
      <li>I actually really like this product!</li>
      <li>Look funny, but who sees me in the tanning bed?</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t use goggles but these fit so nicely.  </li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly what you pay for.</li>
      <li>The items arrived exactly how they were advertised.</li>
      <li>These are too large, and cover way too much of your eye lids.</li>
      <li>I was very leary about the product, after reading the reviews.</li>
      <li>The cracks (outside) of my eyes are not covered, exposing me to the UV light.  </li>
      <li>Arrived fast.</li>
      <li>I use mine for red light therapy, as I never go to tanning booths.</li>
      <li>Looking straight ahead they seem to really protect your eyes and shield them from the uv rays</li>
      <li>But they don&#x27;t really do their job.</li>
      <li>I kind of like the green peep hole view from these goggles.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> so i guess they work ok. and i also look like a raccoon. thank you, and have a nice day.</li>
    <li> The goggles covered the eye area but were very uncomfortable to wear as they are made from a hard substance so that they pushed/cut into the area around my eyes, even after I tried to adjust them.  I have used goggles made by other manufacturers without discomfort, so I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Theese are made very good. I also like the fit &amp; coverage that they give me.</li>
    <li> These things were really cheap plastic material.  The casing was too small so it had been squished in.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to straighted out so it&#x27;ll fit over my eyes.  Pretty worthless and not even worth the money to send back...</li>
    <li> Eye protection goggles are comfortable and easy to put on.  Great way to protect your eyes.</li>
    <li> these goggles are okay but i do wish they were more comfortable...&amp;the pictures are much different from the actual product...i got a bright red pair &amp;the little circle in the center, or \\&quot;lens\\&quot; if you will, is black so you pretty much look wicked scary when you&#x27;re wearing them-then again...if you&#x27;re in a tanning booth, no one should be able to see you anyway. i just wish i got the black pair...there should be an option to choose what color you&#x27;d like. that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Simple perfect for the tannong salon!!! I love the fact that  it comes in a case thank you</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the reviewer who said the goggles leak at the sides.  They are stiff, even in the hot sun, and they don&#x27;t fit that well.  If you shorten the strap it feels too tight on the face and it doesn&#x27;t really fix the side leaks much, so just leave the strap at the maximum length.  The leak at the sides doesn&#x27;t matter when you are lying on your back and you can shift it slightly towards the sunny side when you are on your stomach so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.    It seems to have a pretty solid strap and strap connection.  I had another brand that broke in less than a year so that is important to me.    I kind of like the green peep hole view from these goggles.  It makes you feel like you are deep down in the sea where it&#x27;s nice and cool.    The pair I got was dark blue (almost black) not yellow like the one pictured on Amazon.  Maybe the color you get is randomly selected.  I don&#x27;t know.  I didn&#x27;t get any kind of case, either, as another reviewer apparently did.    I&#x27;ll update this review if I have any problems since I&#x27;ve only used it for about two weeks, but so far I&#x27;m very satisfied with these goggles.</li>
    <li> The goggles are quality, and are as good as any other I have used.  I was only disappointed that the advertisement stated \\&quot;Assorted colors,\\&quot; showed 3 or 4 different colors, and I received 3 black and 2 red.  Not truly assorted in my dictionary.  Otherwise, they are great!</li>
    <li> These \\&quot;sunnies\\&quot; are great, better quality than the eye wear that you get from the actual tanning salons. It comes with an elastic so you can tie them on, perfect for a stand-up tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Very effective, and works great. Wouldnt dare tan without them! Leaves no noticable white rings, with exception to right around eye lids, which is normal.</li>
    <li> I like the sunnies eye goggles.  They are comfortable on your eyes.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that I didn&#x27;t get to choose a color, I was sent a black and a white set.</li>
    <li> I thought when I purchased this item, it would totally black out the sun. There is still a spot of daylight in the middle.</li>
    <li> I was hoping these would fix two issues I had with my current goggles - pinched nose bridge and hard cups too close/on the eyeballs.  The bridge is fine on this product, but the cups are hard and dig into my eyes and hurt.  I also bought Ilidz Tanning Goggles, and those were great!</li>
    <li> These are fine.  Not much to say about the googles.</li>
    <li> Cheap and flimsy. I should have spent a few extra dollars for a sturdier pair that will actually protect my eyes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you pay for. Good packaging.</li>
    <li> These are completely worthless.  All the other critical statements are true: they pinch, they&#x27;re made of cheap, very hard plastic, etc.  But also, for me, they didn&#x27;t even do the job!  They don&#x27;t cover my eyes!!!  The cracks (outside) of my eyes are not covered, exposing me to the UV light.  I had to squint my eyes in order to bunch up the skin and block out the light.  Usually tanning is moderately relaxing, but this time it was 7 minutes of pure torture.  I had a headache from squinting.  Do NOT buy these.</li>
    <li> works when i use led light a little pricey but stays in place</li>
    <li> Item arrived very quickly. Was just as ordered/expected. I ordered two and was a little confused on how to make color choices; all was well as they selected two different colors.</li>
    <li> One of few items to shield you from sun while at the pool.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay to use it, but it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to use it. wish it was little more bit bigger opening.</li>
    <li> I tan on a regular basis so I thought I would get my own goggles to always have on hand.  The ones at my tanning salon seem a little too clear like they wouldn&#x27;t really protect your eyes.  I got these ones and have used them a few times now.  They seem a little ill fitting since you can see light above, below, and on both sides.  I feel like they are not that protective since all that light shines through.  Looking straight ahead they seem to really protect your eyes and shield them from the uv rays but I still worry about all four sides being exposed.</li>
    <li> they are comfortable to use, I like them</li>
    <li> I purchased this pair of eye protection goggles to use with an infrared heat lamp. Some of the reviewer asked the question &amp;#34;Will the infrared lamp hurt my eyes&amp;#34;. The answer is yes!!! I wear this pair while using the lamp on my face for sinus relief.</li>
    <li> The expression \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot; is very true with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These goggles are cheap. That is because they are the \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; mass produced item available in lots of thousands for only a few dollars. These googles, being charged greater than one dollar, is too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you do not have a choice of what color the send you. It is an assorted random selection. Second, the black tint to the lenses do not block out as much sun as you believe they should. The eye pieces are sharp and dig into the eyes yet do not do a good job of completing a seal which means quite a bit of sunlight still gets through. A cheap pair of sunglasses polarized from a brick and mortar store available for just a few dollars do a better job of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These goggles are cheap. I was expecting that but I was at the very least expecting them to be functional. These do not really get the job done and, for the price being charged, it is insulting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the price or effort. Not a recommended product.</li>
    <li> I got it on time and really quick and they aren&#x27;t broken. But they don&#x27;t really do their job. Light comes in through the sides. It doesn&#x27;t completly protect you.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use goggles but these fit so nicely.  Happy to have them.</li>
    <li> best match3game ive playedfora while addictive xxbut easy to understand perfect game to pass tlme when u need something to occupy your mind really enjoyable</li>
    <li> Arrived fast. You don&#x27;t get to choose your color, but I loved mine... Bright orange. Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for the fact that they always as to &amp;#34;see eyewear&amp;#34; when you tan but I actually wear them for the majority of the session.  My main complaint is that the circles are a little bit larger around so I have to take them off for a bit in order to be sure I don&#x27;t have raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> These are cheaply made. They are small for my eyes they feel like a children&#x27;s size. I bought some at my tanning salon for $4.00, they were twice the quality than these. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Did not fit.  One may need an exceptionally skinny nose.  I removed the nose piece and place the eye pieces over my eyes but obviously need to stay supine.</li>
    <li> Not shaped right for my face but they work better than no eye protection.</li>
    <li> These UV eye protection gears are extremely useful</li>
    <li> I bought these to go with a red blue light. I&#x27;ve been using it a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed that its hurt my eyes, so I guess they work.</li>
    <li> I ordered these as part of a 8 week LED light treatment I&#x27;m having to take daily.  The lights are quite bright and blink twice a second which is uncomfortable even with my eyes closed.  First, the Super Sunnies that arrived were not black or red like the photo but hot pink; my least favorite color and not something I really want to be seen wearing.  Second, they&#x27;re rather narrow for my eye distant.  And last and most frustrating is that they don&#x27;t block out nearly as much light as I had expected.  My regular pair of sunglasses do better!  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is that my sister said she could use them.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t use them yet but i&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be good.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive way to guard your eyes from the sun. I use mine for red light therapy, as I never go to tanning booths.</li>
    <li> You put it on your face to cover your eyes it does not fit well at all its to rigid and uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use tanning salons, but these &amp;#34;Super Sunnies&amp;#34; are perfect when lounging pool- or beach-side.  I&#x27;m protecting my eyes and keeping eye wrinkles at bay</li>
    <li> fast delivery, perfect fit....love them</li>
    <li> Feel it&#x27;s a little small around the eyes.</li>
    <li> good price and stuff!</li>
    <li> Terrible! Way too small on the face. Squished the bridge of my nose. Had to squeeze them to my face the entire time because they were squished in the packaging. Not worth even a penny.</li>
    <li> Too small. The light is NOT shielded from my eyes. I can&#x27;t use them and I have to use the Community pair.</li>
    <li> I mean, theres not much else to say. I bought them cuz they were the cheapest ones on here. They do exactly what they are meant to.</li>
    <li> The items arrived exactly how they were advertised. The items arrived promptly- great product-- I would recommend to anyone who tans!</li>
    <li> Work great. Fit great. Look funny, but who sees me in the tanning bed? Nobody. They are perfect for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is good to shield and protect the eyes from light that may be damaging or harmful.  It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> The plastic cuts a little into my skin so I find them to be uncomfortable.  I would like them much more  if they had padding around the edges of the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from being uncomfortable, they are dark and work.  I would recommend not using the elastic band to secure the goggles so they don&#x27;t press too hard into the delicate eye area.</li>
    <li> I had a pair of these that lasted the better part of six years, and this is only the second pair I&#x27;ve needed. Great for use in tanning bed.</li>
    <li> This item has a great price. However, that is the only thing good about it. I was expecting something better. The goggles were not good quality and do not sit on your face well at all. I thought it might just be my face at first, but after letting two of my friends borrow and use them they experienced the same problem. Being an everyday tanner I do keep my goggles in my purse, they broke. I have always kept my goggles in my purse in the past (even plastic ones) and they have never broke. Overall, I was extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> The fit was not good. It felt like it was digging into my eye sockets. I had to take it off after just a few minutes because it was so uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> These work well and are super cheap. I don&#x27;t think you should have to spend a ton on something like this so buy these.</li>
    <li> Pretty generic tanning goggles, but they do get the job done! Love the variety of colors and inexpensive cost! If I need another pair, I&#x27;ll definitely be seeing them.</li>
    <li> These are too large, and cover way too much of your eye lids. I will be buying a smaller pair.</li>
    <li> I was very leary about the product, after reading the reviews. I didn&#x27;t care about the color I got (yellow). But this product seems fine to me. It doesn&#x27;t pinch or seem hard/cheap to me. I actually really like this product!</li>
    <li> This light sucks and does not work.  The light is not big enough alone.  I have used other lamps before and this light bulb is expensive and small.  Not enough to work on a baby.</li>
    <li> The straps are poor quality. The goggles are good.</li>
    <li> We use this product whenever in the pool and have extra pairs for our quest.  This is the third season and they still are good.  Great product.</li>
    <li> nice! thanks! i needed a new pair with a strap to hold them on for when i turn over in the tanning bed</li>
    <li> Super quick shipping, great quality product</li>
    <li> Does the job for what it was purchased.  Arrived in a timely manner and good condition.  I purchased the Sunnies to use when using the the DPL on my face.</li>
    <li> These tanning goggles did not sit on my eyes right. I don&#x27;t know what it was but they were shaped in an odd way. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with other goggles, just these ones.</li>
    <li> Great price and definitely worth a few bucks to save your eyes.  These things will last forever.  I will buy a couple more to have extras.</li>
    <li> I wish the nose bridge was just a tad bit wider for my face, but it still gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I enjoy relaxing in the sun but hate the &amp;#34;squint&amp;#34; that happens, even if my eyes are closed.  These Sunnies are perfect - protecting my eyes in such a way that I don&#x27;t end up with &amp;#34;sunglass&amp;#34; tan lines.  These are handy, effective and inexpensive.  I love them!</li>
    <li> She liked them and hey are what they say they are so no complaints and for the price is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Goggles were missing elastic strap that&#x27;s needed to hold these to my face.</li>
    <li> Item was just as describedl</li>
    <li> Works well for use with UV and other strong lights.</li>
    <li> Instead of providing protection, I feel like it intensifies the brightness of the tanning bed. My regular set are two individual pieces, but are unusable in the stand-up beds, so I bought these, and HATE them.</li>
    <li> i bought it, but i don&#x60;t think i need it and its looks less than i pay for.</li>
    <li> Just an eye shade. Serve it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
