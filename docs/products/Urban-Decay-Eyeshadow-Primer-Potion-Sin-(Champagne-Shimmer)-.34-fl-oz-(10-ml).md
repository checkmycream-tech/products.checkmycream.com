      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>

      <li>I love - absolutely LOVE - the original stuff.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re really looking for a good eye primer</li>
      <li>I got this \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; tinted one because of the good reviews and now it is the one product I cannot live without!    </li>
      <li>And once your shadow is applied it blends easily and stays put even through rigorous activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Compared to the original primer, I wish there was a way to give this zero stars.  </li>
      <li>AND SHE HAS THE ORIGINAL I DECIDED TO BUY SIN.</li>
      <li>I have the Original primer</li>
      <li>And just like the original primer, my lids creased within the hour.</li>
      <li>and then the original eyeshadow primer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very excited to get this product, at first.</li>
      <li>I have normal skin, not too dry or oily and it works great!</li>
      <li>The color is gorgeous, i am darker toned and my lids are actually darker than the rest of my face.</li>
      <li>Beautiful and not that expensive for good makeup.</li>
      <li>A little sweep of this stuff across my lids makes me look bright and awake, but not \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; at all!  </li>
      <li>Makes any shadow color more vibrant, and lasts literally forever.  </li>
      <li>Product was shipped quickly and packaged well.  </li>
      <li>This was a gift to a friend, as I am already familiar with how amazing Urban Decay Primer Potion is.</li>
      <li>Make sure you let it dry before brushing any shadow on, though, otherwise it won&#x27;t brush on smoothly.    </li>
      <li>It is amazing, and keeps your eyeshadow in place all day long.</li>
      <li>I like to just dab a little on my ring finger and sweep across my eyelids for more sheerness and better control.</li>
      <li>I tried the Sin tint because I loved the original so much and thought the extra tint would make my matte shades a little more shimmery</li>
      <li>Also, I love Urban Decay products because they are Leaping Bunny certified and do not test on animals in any way, shape, or form.</li>
      <li>FIRST OF ALL</li>
      <li>After using it, however, I would have paid twice as much!</li>
      <li>My eyes are small, this color makes my eyes look bright.</li>
      <li>Really fun product, and much cheaper than most other products.</li>
      <li>I am very disappointed with this purchase, I bought this &#x27;cause it has very good reviews from people, so I guess it should be a good primer.</li>
      <li>I really like it under eyeshadow too.  </li>
      <li>and it really helps combat the issues I was having with preventing my eye makeup from sliding and creasing.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to try this out</li>
      <li>IT HAS SO MUCH GLITTER.</li>
      <li>under others, not so much.  </li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>my make up wears off fast.</li>
      <li>I have tried other primers that were just ok</li>
      <li>I decided to buy SIN because I wanted to do something new!</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t spend a huge amount of money on makeup and this struck me as a little pricey at first.</li>
      <li>so no need to check your make up every few hours to make sure it is in place.</li>
      <li>I do not usually write product reviews because I am usually not overwhelmed one way or another.</li>
      <li>and the color is pretty enough to wear alone.</li>
      <li>I actually did not even like Urban Decay&#x27;s original primer potion.  </li>
      <li>and can also be cool under other colors.  </li>
      <li>The original NEVER creases for me, this stuff made the same shadows I always wear with the original crease worse than if I don&#x27;t use a primer.  </li>
      <li>I read some other reviews, and I think the success of this product might depend on your skin type.</li>
      <li>AND MY FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT URBAN DECAY PRIMER  POTION SINCE WE LIVE TOGETHER</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect no-make-up makeup, if you know what I mean - when \\&quot;natural\\&quot; is the preferred look but actual natural is just a bit scary.    </li>
      <li>Or my other favorite look is to do a smoky eye with this as the base, so I don&#x27;t really need to worry about adding more shimmer.</li>
      <li>so much it makes me want to buy all the other colors.</li>
      <li>Even wearing it alone my eyelid&#x27;s skin looks dry and old.</li>
      <li>The sin does add a little \\&quot;sparkle\\&quot; but not so much that you look like a teeny bopper going to a Justin Beiber concert.</li>

<li> I find it difficult to blend with any shades other than browns/golds, so if you are looking for a more universal primer, go with a clear version.</li>

<li> Amazing product if used by itself or as a base for other shadows.</li>

<li> OTHER THAN THAT</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found myself using much less shadow and having it last a lot longer than usual.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s not really cool to look like you have a ton of makeup on to work out.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it everyday this week</li>
<li> This champagne color just looked really stark on my lids, i&#x27;m about the color of ashanti/or nc45 for MAC folks.</li>
<li> I have ALWAYS had trouble with my eye make up moving around and forming a hideous line in the crease of my eye.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t typically use the urban decay primer potion, my lids still crease with it, it is simply too liquidy (if that is a word...). I really wanted to try this out just to maybe see if I could make it work. The color is gorgeous, i am darker toned and my lids are actually darker than the rest of my face. This champagne color just looked really stark on my lids, i&#x27;m about the color of ashanti/or nc45 for MAC folks. Even with blending, it looked ashy, not shimmery. And just like the original primer, my lids creased within the hour. I will stick with my MAC paint pots for a primer with color to it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it everyday this week and it doesn&#x27;t fade or get that weird eyelid line, it stays put til you remove it.  Color is nice, it&#x27;s great for that pretty clean look.  I like this one so much it makes me want to buy all the other colors.</li>
    <li> I actually did not even like Urban Decay&#x27;s original primer potion.  I got this \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; tinted one because of the good reviews and now it is the one product I cannot live without!    I work in a fitness center and it&#x27;s not really cool to look like you have a ton of makeup on to work out.  But, sometimes a girl needs a little help after staying out too late, having a few too many beers, you know the drill.  A little sweep of this stuff across my lids makes me look bright and awake, but not \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; at all!  It&#x27;s the perfect no-make-up makeup, if you know what I mean - when \\&quot;natural\\&quot; is the preferred look but actual natural is just a bit scary.    I really like it under eyeshadow too.  If you like a shimmery shadow, this stuff intensifies the look a bit without going over the edge into glittery.  I&#x27;ve found myself using much less shadow and having it last a lot longer than usual.  Make sure you let it dry before brushing any shadow on, though, otherwise it won&#x27;t brush on smoothly.    The only thing to be careful about is the enclosed applicator.  When I use that, it goes on way too thick.  I like to just dab a little on my ring finger and sweep across my eyelids for more sheerness and better control.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product, at first. When I tried it on, it was too shimmery and it didnt blend in well with my light purple eye shadow and my shadow ended up creasing, anyway.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to a friend, as I am already familiar with how amazing Urban Decay Primer Potion is. I use it every day and it really helps combat the issues I was having with preventing my eye makeup from sliding and creasing. Primer Potion is ideal for those of us with oily skin. I have used other \\&quot;silicone\\&quot; type primers in the past, like Hard Candy and ULTA&#x27;s in-store brand primer and none compare. This is the real deal. Perfect gift for any woman. The champagne primer is shimmery and adds a shimmer to any eye shadow product or can be used alone. My friend received her product in perfect condition from the seller and was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> and can also be cool under other colors.  under others, not so much.  but can also be good on its own as eyeshadow!</li>
    <li> I have ALWAYS had trouble with my eye make up moving around and forming a hideous line in the crease of my eye. But after using the Primer I no longer have that issue! A little bit goes a long way, and lasts all day so no need to check your make up every few hours to make sure it is in place.</li>
    <li> I read some other reviews, and I think the success of this product might depend on your skin type. I have normal skin, not too dry or oily and it works great! I like to wear it alone, for a nice clean shimmer that lasts. Or my other favorite look is to do a smoky eye with this as the base, so I don&#x27;t really need to worry about adding more shimmer. Really fun product, and much cheaper than most other products. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! Perfect eye shadow application every time, and lasts ALL DAY. I got married on a boat on the bay, and even after tears, winds, and spray I still had picture perfect eyes.</li>
    <li> OK SO IM KNEW TO MAKE UP AND MY FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT URBAN DECAY PRIMER  POTION SINCE WE LIVE TOGETHER AND SHE HAS THE ORIGINAL I DECIDED TO BUY SIN. FIRST OF ALL IT HAS SO MUCH GLITTER. ITS A GREAT PRODUCT. I ONLY HAVE ON PROBLEM SINCE IT IS KNEW WHEN I CLOSED IT THE PRODUCT SPILLED OUT I THINK URBAN DECAY SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. SO JUST A CAUTION BE CAREFUL WHEN CLOSING IT. OTHER THAN THAT I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> It is thick and brand too.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this purchase, I bought this &#x27;cause it has very good reviews from people, so I guess it should be a good primer. I tried on and it made my eyelid completely dry, so I guess that&#x27;s all there is, it makes your eyelid dry so eyeshadow can last longer, but it looks awful, my eyelid seemed like an old woman&#x27;s eyelid, the skin looks thick and dry. Even wearing it alone my eyelid&#x27;s skin looks dry and old. Didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> Amazing product if used by itself or as a base for other shadows. Subtle shimmer.  Lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Compared to the original primer, I wish there was a way to give this zero stars.  I love - absolutely LOVE - the original stuff.  Makes any shadow color more vibrant, and lasts literally forever.  Even through a shower if I forget to take my makeup off at night.  I tried the Sin tint because I loved the original so much and thought the extra tint would make my matte shades a little more shimmery and....  This stuff is GARBAGE.  The original NEVER creases for me, this stuff made the same shadows I always wear with the original crease worse than if I don&#x27;t use a primer.  I had waxy globs of tinted primer and makeup stuck in the creases of my lids.  NEVER again will I use this junk, I&#x27;m sticking with the original and best.  If this crap creased for you, give the original a try.  I promise it doesn&#x27;t crease.</li>
    <li> I like the shape of it. It works well. The color matches my skin color which is really really pale.</li>
    <li> My eyeshadow stayed on all day (even during a nap!) and the color is pretty enough to wear alone. Beautiful and not that expensive for good makeup. My sister tells me it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is easy to apply.  My eyes are small, this color makes my eyes look bright.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; color is a subtle shimmery nude. If you&#x27;ve ever used Urban Decay primers you know that your shadow isn&#x27;t going anywhere. Definately something everyone should have in their makeup bag.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re really looking for a good eye primer so your eyeshadow won&#x27;t crease... This is it!!  I tried it and I loved it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The golden shade looks beautiful on it&#x27;s own or as an eye shadow primer! I find it difficult to blend with any shades other than browns/golds, so if you are looking for a more universal primer, go with a clear version.</li>
    <li> i honestly love this for just a cream eyeshadow i don&#x27;t ever use it as a primer because of how gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS- doesn&#x27;t crease, beautiful color, stays on all day, relates to the eyeshadow sin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS- Too shimmery, to gold, i wish i would of gotten the actually eyeshadow in sin and then the original eyeshadow primer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It is shimmery, so on my lazy days I use it as eyeshadow. Keeps my makeup perfect for a long time. I have fallen asleep in my makeup and woken up to it still being flawless. Easily removed with make up remover. Also, I love Urban Decay products because they are Leaping Bunny certified and do not test on animals in any way, shape, or form. One tube lasts me several months and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I suffer from allergies and tend to rub my eyes a lot ... which usually means eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t last on me. Even when I am not rubbing my eyes.. my make up wears off fast. This product helps take care of that problem by helping my eye make up last longer... and when I say longer I mean ALL DAY. I decided to buy SIN because I wanted to do something new! I have the Original primer and I wanted to see if it would make a big difference. It really doesn&#x27;t. The sin does add a little \\&quot;sparkle\\&quot; but not so much that you look like a teeny bopper going to a Justin Beiber concert. I thought I was going to hate not having the wand anymore. But I don&#x27;t miss it. You were using your finger to smudge it anyway so this just skips a step. Great product!</li>
    <li> I do not usually write product reviews because I am usually not overwhelmed one way or another. This is an incredible exception. I have tried other primers that were just ok but Urban Decay blew me away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t spend a huge amount of money on makeup and this struck me as a little pricey at first. After using it, however, I would have paid twice as much! This tinted primer gives your lids a subtle shimmer to perk up your eyes even before you apply shadow. And once your shadow is applied it blends easily and stays put even through rigorous activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bartender and sometimes it means working up quite sweat. Even after 14 hours on my feet in the middle of summer my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease or even fade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on top of that, the primer lasts FOREVER!! You only use a tiny bit at a time so one tube will last a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely invest in this primer!</li>
    <li> Product was shipped quickly and packaged well.  I&#x27;ve used this product many times before and love it!  I&#x27;ll be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> I love this primer! It is amazing, and keeps your eyeshadow in place all day long. It so arrived quickly and promptly which I love!</li>
