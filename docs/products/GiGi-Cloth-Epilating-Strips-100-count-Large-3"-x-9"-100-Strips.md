<li> I don&#x27;t get the painful hair bumbs any more.</li>
<li> They do grab all of the hair and without the pain that other brands and types of strips leave.  </li>
<li> and I think it hurts way less.  </li>
<li> They also do not shed the little fiber pieces like the muslin ones do.</li>
<li> I do all the waxing myself and usually use clay or sugar waxes (the ones which are rinsable).</li>
<li> I have been waxing for the past 10 years.</li>
<li> Instead they are a thick material that does not grip the wax as well.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t shed and does not Lea e behind any pieces.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t break the hair, they collect all the wax (I hate the strips which come in the boxes with almost all the waxes, because they simply don&#x27;t stick to the wax)</li>
<li> I just reordered from a previous order and am very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Great size for eyebrows and upper lip. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was when you cut them...bits and pieces of the cloth become unravel.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I purchased the large ones until they arrived. I needed them for facial waxing and thought they were the smaller ones, but they actually work for the face as well. I simply just cut them in fours, I get more out of them than the small pack.</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never known about these.  I&#x27;ve only ever used the muslin strips but these were cheaper so I reluctantly gave them a shot and they&#x27;re SO much better!  I love the way I don&#x27;t get the little pieces of stray muslin sticking to my skin afterwards and I think it hurts way less.  This is all I&#x27;ll ever buy from now on!!</li>

    <li> The Gigi cloth wax strips are my favorite strip to use when I wax. I recommend them highly to at-home waxers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this seller lied and sent two Muslin strips instead of two cloth ones. I don&#x27;t live in the States so returning such purchases is more hassle than the purchase is worth. Up to you if you buy this via amazon or just go to the nearest SallyBeauty store and buy your own packs (it&#x27;s cheaper at SallyBeauty, especially if you factor in the shipping cost).</li>
    <li> These strips were greattttt...non sticky,long lasting and easy to use infact for than normal strips. I love them they work well with my Gigi espresso wax😊</li>
    <li> I love these sheets.  The it minimizes the pain of waxing.  I was nervous try but they are 100% better than the regular strips.  I don&#x27;t get the painful hair bumbs any more.</li>
    <li> Love this product I&#x27;m very happy with it. The strips work better than the muslin fabric. It doesn&#x27;t shed and does not Lea e behind any pieces. This product came how it describes. Thank you</li>
    <li> I use these for legs, bikini line, underarms, face - they are excellent.  I have tried other types of strips and only use these now.</li>
    <li> Best strips for waxing</li>
    <li> I wax everywhere! at home. These strips work great with my cream wax. I can use the same strip more than once and it does not seep through like the muslin ones. Its a great deal for the at home waxer!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping. I thought I read somewhere you could use these with hardwax, so I tried it. Didn&#x27;t work for me with these. No worries. I try again with soft wax.</li>
    <li> easy to use and cut into smaller strips</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t feel like the muslin strips but they work very well.  They also do not shed the little fiber pieces like the muslin ones do.</li>
    <li> These strips are wonderful, very easy to grab onto and they do not slip out of you hand.  They do grab all of the hair and without the pain that other brands and types of strips leave.  Little to no redness, you are able to work very quickly.</li>
    <li> These are my favorite epilating strips. I used to buy them from the beauty supply but they were almost triple the price of what amazon is selling for.  I recommend to anyone who waxes at home.</li>
    <li> Came fast and perfect juat the same as i got at sallys but for less. $$</li>
    <li> I wax all the time and these are the best waxing strips for the price and how many you get. They do not tear.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i expected.. I usually use it with the all purpose wax and it works really well</li>
    <li> These are not the same muslin strips that they used to be.  Instead they are a thick material that does not grip the wax as well.  I just reordered from a previous order and am very disappointed.</li>
