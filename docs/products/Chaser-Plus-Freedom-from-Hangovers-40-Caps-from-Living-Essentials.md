      <li>sure, but nowhere near what you would have otherwise.     </li>
      <li>Nice product We tried for several years and works!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to get smashed, I would recommend just buying the right vitamins.  </li>
      <li>This product did exactly as it advertised.</li>
      <li>I felt the next day than I&#x27;m sure I would have otherwise.</li>
      <li>and you will find your hangover the next morning much much MUCH more manageable.    </li>
      <li>What they DO is they make the next day a LOT more manageable.</li>
      <li>Well, for a light drinking session I would say yes it more or less eliminates hangovers</li>
      <li>but i actually feel good the next day.</li>
      <li>but i actually feel energetic and lively.</li>
      <li>and i woke up 6 hours later feeling fine.  </li>
      <li>The next day, I felt just fine.  </li>
      <li>I have tried the RU-21 pills too and didn&#x27;t care for them too much.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like taking acetometaphin, and aspirin doesn&#x27;t really do the trick.  </li>
      <li>This worked really well</li>
      <li>They are much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>For me, Chaser pills absolutely work.</li>
      <li>I seem to always have a hangover when i drink to much.</li>
      <li>I would HIGHLY recommend these to people who easily get hangovers ruin the next 2 days after drinking.</li>
      <li>Other than that they work ok.</li>
      <li>Like any supplement you should check with yourdoctor before taking it to make sure it&#x27;s not going to interfere with any personal health problem you might have or any medications you currently take.     </li>
      <li>I have found that the older</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend if you suffer from hangovers.</li>
      <li>My head&#x27;s a bit fuzzy but not the pounding hangover headache you normally get or see on tv/movies.</li>
      <li>Directions say to take 2 with your first drink, and take more throughout the night, however I&#x27;ve found that it makes me feel less effects from alcohol while I&#x27;m actually</li>

      <li>This is a no miracle drug and don&#x27;t expect results like something far beyond your imagination.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any faith really in that they would actually work...</li>
      <li>It completely works every time.  </li>
      <li>I take them just like they show on bottle and so far they have worked with Rum, tequila, whiskey, beer and wine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rarely able to enjoy social drinks with friends because I would be sick the whole next day.</li>
      <li>With ChaserPlus, the headache is no more, and I can drink up to three glasses over an evening of aperitivo, good food and a small, after-dinner glass of wine without any repercussions.</li>
      <li>Also, after a certain number of drinks there&#x27;s really no way of preventing a hangover.  </li>

<li> It lessens the hangover especially day after heavy drinking session with colleagues.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t drink on an empty stomach and drink plenty of water.</li>
<li> I get the harder my hangovers will hurt.</li>
<li> I stumbled upon it at a gas station a few years back</li>
<li> I would buy it again if it weren&#x27;t so expensive but will just choose not to drink than to pay such  high price.</li>
<li> Its not perfect for me depending on how much i drink</li>
<li> Dizziness - Like... 90% less than what it would have been.</li>
<li> Look, in a world where there are no absolutes and no quick fixes or cures.....</li>
<li> : It&#x27;s always going to be there a little bit.</li>
<li> you&#x27;ll feel it a little bit.     </li>
<li> A little fuzzy and hazy</li>
<li> Again, this is after a night of heavy drinking</li>
<li> If your a heavy drinker you might have to take four pills for one night.</li>
<li> Therefore, if you go out and get seriously wasted it will help you.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a no miracle drug and don&#x27;t expect results like something far beyond your imagination. But this works for me somehow. It lessens the hangover especially day after heavy drinking session with colleagues. I will keep on using this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. Its that simple. I seem to always have a hangover when i drink to much. When i take two of these puppies not only do i not have a hangover but i actually feel good the next day.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a hang-over in years ever since I started taking these which has been about 3 years, I believe. I take them just like they show on bottle and so far they have worked with Rum, tequila, whiskey, beer and wine. Not to mention Long Island Iced Teas, which has Vodka and Gin also in them. I will not drink without them now. I didn&#x27;t have any faith really in that they would actually work... Glad they did! Wish I could find them at a good price even if I had to buy a larger quantity though.</li>
    <li> Ok this product WORKS end of story. For some reason my body is not so great at taking the poison that is Alcohol.  I get hangovers sooooo easily its reduculous which I guess is a good thing because my body is letting me know when i mess with it.  But let me tell you something this product is fantastic.  I drank almost a 750 Ml of rum last night and i took 7 of these, 2 when i started drinking 2 more about two and a half hours later and 2 more right before i went to sleep and i woke up 6 hours later feeling fine.  Not only am i not hungover but i actually feel energetic and lively. I would HIGHLY recommend these to people who easily get hangovers ruin the next 2 days after drinking.</li>
    <li> I tried this, as directed, over New Year&#x27;s Eve, and was really happy at how much better I felt the next day than I&#x27;m sure I would have otherwise. I think it even helped me to sleep better. I would give it a five-star review if it were priced more reasonably. It&#x27;s still worth the money.</li>
    <li> It can not be overstated about how awesome this product is. I stumbled upon it at a gas station a few years back and I have been using it ever since.    Take two pills with your first drink and then two more every 2 hours or so (6 drinks estimated) and you will find your hangover the next morning much much MUCH more manageable.    Does it ELIMINATE hangovers? Well, for a light drinking session I would say yes it more or less eliminates hangovers but if you party up all night like there&#x27;s no tomorrow then you&#x27;re still going to feel SOMETHING in the morning- just not nearly as much as you would have if you had not taken it.     Look, in a world where there are no absolutes and no quick fixes or cures..... this is about as close as you can hope to get. Nothing you do (except not drinking) is going to make you feel 100% like you never touched a drop of alcohol the night before... you&#x27;ll feel SOMETHING, sure, but nowhere near what you would have otherwise.     Here&#x27;s my report after taking 6 chasers during a good night of drinking (7 or 8 hours or so) the next morning I feel:    Headache: It&#x27;s always going to be there a little bit. Alcohol dehydrates you- there&#x27;s kinda no way of getting around that unless you drink a lot of water and/or sports drinks during your drinking session or before you go to sleep (a good idea in my opinion, just sayin). My head&#x27;s a bit fuzzy but not the pounding hangover headache you normally get or see on tv/movies. I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a headache so much as just a bit fuzzy kind of like when you wake up after having taken NyQuil or something. A little fuzzy and hazy but it goes away as you wake up more and start movin&#x27; around. I have never needed or wanted to take Advil or Asprin the next day if I used Chasers the night before.     Nausea- None. This is the biggest plus for me. If you drink like crazy then you will eventually throw up because your body says \\&quot;hey! No more!\\&quot; But if I drink in relative moderation, know my limit, and take Chasers I never have any nauseau the next day. I have never thrown up the morning after I have drank if I&#x27;ve taken chasers. You may still have a bit of an upset stomach that just comes from drinking a lot- acid reflux, heartburn, etc.. but that&#x27;s normal from a night of heavy drinking anyway.     Dizziness - Like... 90% less than what it would have been. Again, this is after a night of heavy drinking so light drinkers might find that it&#x27;s even better.     Thirsty- Yeah, drinking dehydrates you- Chasers don&#x27;t help with that so drink plenty of water / gatorade / sports drinks to help combat the dehydration. You&#x27;ll still probably wake up with dry mouth though.    Chasers will not 100% eliminate any consequences or feelings from a night of heavy drinking- They&#x27;re really not meant for that crazy long night of heavy drinking and partying - but they DO help with the symptoms of hangovers. And if you only have a few cocktails they&#x27;ll REALLY help with it. You will still feel like you drank the night before so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; cure and you&#x27;ll wake up feeling awesome as though you never touched a drop of alcohol- you won&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll feel good, you&#x27;ll feel better than you would have, and personally I think you&#x27;ll be amazed at how good you feel but you&#x27;ll still know you drank the night before- you&#x27;ll feel it a little bit.     They also do NOT stop you from feeling drunk or the effects of drinking...and they ABSOLUTELY do NOT stop, negate, or slow down the long term health effects of alcohol abuse. They will NOT make you \\&quot;okay\\&quot; to drive. Please please PLEASE do NOT drink and drive. Chasers don&#x27;t stop you from being drunk.    What they DO is they make the next day a LOT more manageable. It won&#x27;t work for everyone, sure, but I&#x27;ve had great success with it and now I NEVER go out drinking without some Chasers in my pocket. I tell all of my friends to try it and I&#x27;ve not found anyone yet who hasn&#x27;t had a similar experience to mine/    Like any supplement you should check with yourdoctor before taking it to make sure it&#x27;s not going to interfere with any personal health problem you might have or any medications you currently take.     In a nutshell: It works wonders. Try it out!</li>
    <li> For me, Chaser pills absolutely work. For people who say they don&#x27;t work I would ask if they even bothered to hydrate and/or eat when they drank. Chasers are close to a magic pill but they don&#x27;t do ALL the work for you. Come on people, use common sense. Don&#x27;t drink on an empty stomach and drink plenty of water. I&#x27;ve had times where I drank 15+ drinks in a night but took my Chasers, ate food, and hydrated. I woke up feeling fantastic. I felt maybe 5 to 10 percent of my hangover, which is obviously way better than feeling like absolute crap the next day. Another great hangover prevention is Pedialyte! People knock it because it has a medicine-like name and is designed for hydrating babies, but it works wonders! Drink a full, cold Pedialyte before you drink alcohol and combine with proper use of Chaser pills and you WILL feel great in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;m rarely able to enjoy social drinks with friends because I would be sick the whole next day. Once I was introduced to this product that was never a problem again. If taken properly it is highly effective.</li>
    <li> Recently the manufacture of Chasers discontinued this product. Highly disappointed and didn&#x27;t know what to do, I was told Amazon does carry this product. Very Relieved and quickly ordered a few bottles.  This is the only product that relieves any symptoms from a hangover. Would highly recommend if you suffer from hangovers.</li>
    <li> love this stuff!  It completely works every time.  If I have a little too much, I get bad hangovers pretty easily now.  I don&#x27;t like taking acetometaphin, and aspirin doesn&#x27;t really do the trick.  Directions say to take 2 with your first drink, and take more throughout the night, however I&#x27;ve found that it makes me feel less effects from alcohol while I&#x27;m actually drinking(that&#x27;s the charcol working).  Or even if I forget to take them before my first drink, I can still take 1 or 2 capsules before bed or even the next morning, and it still works practically eliminates my hangovers.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> If your a heavy drinker you might have to take four pills for one night. Other than that they work ok. Its not perfect for me depending on how much i drink but it eases the nausea and lessens my headache.</li>
    <li> I get headaches from 2 sips of wine!!! With ChaserPlus, the headache is no more, and I can drink up to three glasses over an evening of aperitivo, good food and a small, after-dinner glass of wine without any repercussions. I love wine with my food and now do not have to worry about headaches at all. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I would recommened chaser for all drinkers. This seems to worked best for me. I am disappointed that I cant find here locally where I live. Walgreens used to carry it.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering on line is way to expensive for me to purchased. Lowering the price where it should be and I will start getting it</li>
    <li> Chaser pills work great.I love this product, just wish the price was more reasonable rate.I have tried the RU-21 pills too and didn&#x27;t care for them too much.I&#x27;m not a heavy drinker but when I do have more than 3 drinks and I take the Chaser Pills.I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the delivery time.  The price was a lot cheaper than CVS or Rite Aid, when they have it in stock.</li>
    <li> This worked really well but I wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.  I took the pills before we went out and usually even one glass of wine affects me.  I had two glasses of wine and then we had a bit of a margarita and I took a couple more before going to bed.  The next day, I felt just fine.  This never happens - I always feel sick.  I would buy it again if it weren&#x27;t so expensive but will just choose not to drink than to pay such  high price.</li>
    <li> Great product that I have used for several years! Greatly helps with after wine headaches.&lt;br /&gt;Please do not ever stop making this product. It is fabulous and the best I have found.</li>
    <li> This product did exactly as it advertised. Use as directed and it will greatly reduce the effects of comsuning alcohol. Barely even knew I was drinking heavy the night before..!!!!</li>
    <li> I have found that the older I get the harder my hangovers will hurt. I tried this product and it works. Although, keep in mind it is not a cure all. Therefore, if you go out and get seriously wasted it will help you. If you follow the directions and are not drinking to the point of falling, you&#x27;ll wake up without an hangover, maybe only a little tire</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to get smashed, I would recommend just buying the right vitamins.  They are much cheaper.  Also, after a certain number of drinks there&#x27;s really no way of preventing a hangover.  I&#x27;ve had plenty.</li>
    <li> people dont be stupid, paying $199 dollars for this is a scam.  buy Drink Wingman or Ru 21 plus they dont have an OUTRAGEOUS price like this one here!!!</li>
    <li> No hangovers any more. Nice product We tried for several years and works! Maybe people can think diferent for us is amazing</li>
