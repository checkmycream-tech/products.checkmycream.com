      <li>Great great and serious volume.</li>
      <li>This one is and it worked fine.</li>
      <li>I love the size - fits easily in small purse or pocket but thats not the best thing about this mascara; and I have tried tons  of them !!</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous size for travel.  </li>
      <li>I have just tried so many different mascaras, and so many were much better than this.  </li>
      <li>Now to head over to Sephora to buy the full size</li>
      <li>Need the full size.</li>
      <li>Other than that it is a great buy.</li>
      <li>It dries out too quick</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t read how big the container was, but overall I loved it!</li>
      <li>Seller was right on time with delivery.  </li>
      <li>Lasts all day, all night, and never runs down my face unless I have a really good cry (which doesn&#x27;t happen often</li>
      <li>The first I have ever used that does exactly what it says it will.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re Real!</li>
      <li>It really extended my eyelases!</li>
      <li>Real!  </li>
      <li>I have bought more since in a larger size.</li>
      <li>Especially when you have very light and straight lashes.</li>
      <li>Love this sample size for first time use, makes your lashes really long!</li>
      <li>My advice would be try it out prior to a special event so in case it doesn&#x27;t work out for you, you know ahead of time!</li>
      <li>(they remove even waterproof mascara), so putting it on is easy and removing it is simple, too.</li>
      <li>My eyes are super sensitive, teary and I also perspire alot.</li>
      <li>when this came in the mail i was so excited to try it because there isnt a Sephora or Ulta near where i live.</li>
      <li>Doll Eye wears well and provides volume; but it dries out fast and gets very gloppy.  </li>
      <li>My girls and I really like this</li>
      <li>I am VERY picky</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see a real difference between this and sone of the Avon products that I use.</li>
      <li>The wand really is designed to amp up your lashes.</li>
      <li>It has all the good qualities of the full size plus the benefit of being small enough for travel or to put into an evening bag.</li>
      <li>And I don&#x27;t mean in a good way,</li>
      <li>They really take my eyelashes to a whole new level, and make my eyes</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;m ordering the full size tube.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything extraordinary like some regular mascaras, but it did the job.</li>
      <li>I used to use NYX Doll Eye mascara; and to tell you the truth it isn&#x27;t that far off from this (and a whole lot cheaper).  </li>
      <li>I mean in a 5 lashes have turned into one kind of way.  </li>
      <li>i had gone through chemo and my eye lashes never grew back right.  </li>
      <li>It magnifies the eyelashes and makes them appear very long and full.</li>
      <li>The mascara makes your lashes look super long</li>
      <li>Gives a very natural look.  </li>
      <li>the small tube, it&#x27;s so cute, and I like to take it with me as I am on the go!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands - and ended up cruising the mascaras at Sephora a few months ago when I came across this little miracle.</li>
      <li>Too much liquid and not enough drama.</li>
      <li>I have found that this mascara looks natural and does not clump up.</li>
      <li>Might buy the large one after I see how long this one lasts.</li>
      <li>I expected a little more...</li>
      <li>I would buy a bigger tube next time, and I highly recommend anyone try this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved the mascara and the wand, I was just disappointed in the size and how much I got.</li>
      <li>I like this Mascara very much, I just got a mini size to see if I like it, Will order the full size next, the small wand on the mini is hard to handle.</li>
      <li>You can get the same effect with a much cheaper, less &amp;#34;broken-hearted teenager at prom&amp;#34; post-shower experience.</li>
      <li>I love this Product, It leaves your lashes looking very dark and thick.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the brush or the product itself awful to get off and clumpy</li>
    <li> My girls and I really like this, we tried others but come back to this one.</li>
    <li> Only buy the small travel size. The wand in the regular size is flexible and therefore it doesn&#x27;t go on as well. I LOVE IT and bought some for my mom too.</li>
    <li> I like the mascara--too much money for too small a package!!  I expected a little more...Might buy the large one after I see how long this one lasts.</li>
    <li> I get compliments all the time on my eyelashes these days.  Part of that comes from using NutraLuxe Lash each morning (you put a thin line above your lash line -- it&#x27;s like vitamins for eyelashes).  The other part, however, comes from having a mascara that makes my lashes stand out with just one coat.  I use the Neutrogena makeup remover wipes to get it off (they remove even waterproof mascara), so putting it on is easy and removing it is simple, too.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It really extended my eyelases! I will be buying the bigger version! Worth the price ladies!!</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever tried. My eyes are super sensitive, teary and I also perspire alot. This never bothers my eyes and it does not smudge all day.</li>
    <li> I am a total self declared mascara snob.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many different brands - and ended up cruising the mascaras at Sephora a few months ago when I came across this little miracle. I tried it in the store, and was hooked.  So, I bought me a tube - and ever since that, I&#x27;ve been helplessly hooked. They really take my eyelashes to a whole new level, and make my eyes *pop*.  Definite beauty must have!</li>
    <li> The thief he kindly spoke, there are many here among us who feel that life is but a  joke.  This &amp;#34; great &amp;#34; mascara is a joke.  If you want stiff lashes and raccoon eyes, this is for you.  I&#x27;d stick with CityLash and UltaLash mascara.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product, and goes on just as it says! I got the trial tube, and I love it! I would buy a bigger tube next time, and I highly recommend anyone try this product. Makes my lashes look very long and full.&lt;br /&gt;Love the small tube, it&#x27;s so cute, and I like to take it with me as I am on the go!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product, and it arrived very quickly in a little white package.</li>
    <li> I liked it.  But I am always looking for fuller thicker lashed.  Currently this one is the best but I will always continue my search</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the mascara and the wand, I was just disappointed in the size and how much I got. I guess it was my fault I didn&#x27;t read how big the container was, but overall I loved it!</li>
    <li> I know everybody&#x27;s eyelashes are different, but THIS brush did not separate mine at all.  The mascara itself was OK, but it didn&#x27;t volumize at all.  My lashes just clumped together.  I have just tried so many different mascaras, and so many were much better than this.  I hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> Great mascara, but for the price you can get a real sized one. I hadn&#x27;t realized that I was paying close to $40 for something the size of my pinky. Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> i had gone through chemo and my eye lashes never grew back right.  this helps bring what i have left back to life!!</li>
    <li> Seen this on qvc for like 40 bucks. Found it on amazon for 10. Had to give it a whirl. So, nothing to great about this. You can by the same results from stores that sale mascara. It makes my eye lashes itch after a couple of hours. The product feels stiff and hard on my lashes. I will use just cause but not exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I used to use NYX Doll Eye mascara; and to tell you the truth it isn&#x27;t that far off from this (and a whole lot cheaper).  Doll Eye wears well and provides volume; but it dries out fast and gets very gloppy.  Made up word, I know&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re Real!  Aside from having a hilarious name, separates, volumizes like CRAZY, and wears like iron.  I end up with lashes closer to &amp;#34;doll eyes&amp;#34; than the mascara of that name gives me.  2 coats for a super dramatic look, one coat for work.  Lasts all day, all night, and never runs down my face unless I have a really good cry (which doesn&#x27;t happen often thankfully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to buy the mini tube because it still lasts quite some time, but not so long that it gets an opportunity to dry out.  I think this adds to my love of the quality of the product.  Possibly if Doll Eye came in a mini tube I would still feel the same way about it.  I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
    <li> I love the size - fits easily in small purse or pocket but thats not the best thing about this mascara; and I have tried tons  of them !! This one lives up to it&#x27;s name alright ! looks great on and does thicken and coat very well. I have recommended it to others</li>
    <li> This mascara is awesome!  The wand really is designed to amp up your lashes. I am VERY picky and I was very pleased. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Im not the type to have caked on makeup. I have found that this mascara looks natural and does not clump up.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with mascara and i like mini stuff. when this came in the mail i was so excited to try it because there isnt a Sephora or Ulta near where i live. it make your lashes so long. love it!</li>
    <li> I like the spikey wand. It helps in separating the mascara. It doesn&#x27;t take too many coats to get thickness. I&#x27;ve bought this twice now.</li>
    <li> I love this Product, It leaves your lashes looking very dark and thick. Great for achieveing the smookey eye look. The only reason it gor 4 out of 5 stars is because i think the product is very small for its price and runs out fast. Other than that it is a great buy. Next time i will just buy the regular size version.</li>
    <li> I like this Mascara very much, I just got a mini size to see if I like it, Will order the full size next, the small wand on the mini is hard to handle. Need the full size.</li>
    <li> honestly i think this product is overrated. It wasn&#x27;t bad by any means; however i think cheaper mascaras from covergirl or maybelline work just as well.</li>
    <li> Love this and will be buying again.  Seller was right on time with delivery.  It just makes your eyes pop as you use this.  Especially when you have very light and straight lashes.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous size for travel.  I love it.  It has all the good qualities of the full size plus the benefit of being small enough for travel or to put into an evening bag.</li>
    <li> best mascara EVER! wont ever use any other kinds ever again!!!!! Now to head over to Sephora to buy the full size one or maybe even a couple lol</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a real difference between this and sone of the Avon products that I use. Not much clumping though.</li>
    <li> Nothing against the seller, I just don&#x27;t like the product.  I&#x27;ve tried applying it several different occasions and just can&#x27;t get it to not look like fake lashes.  And I don&#x27;t mean in a good way, I mean in a 5 lashes have turned into one kind of way.  Could be user error, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem and have tried many a mascara.  My advice would be try it out prior to a special event so in case it doesn&#x27;t work out for you, you know ahead of time!</li>
    <li> Did not curl my eyelashes as I expected.</li>
    <li> The best mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> i loved the mascara and the shipping was very fast. The size is smaller than what i thought, but it works for what i wanted. The mascara makes your lashes look super long my only complaint is i wish it came in other colors</li>
    <li> Love this sample size for first time use, makes your lashes really long!</li>
    <li> It dries out too quick</li>
    <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes RIDICULOUS WITHOUT clumping like that 3d stuff does. This is the best mascara ever!!!!! I plan on keeping the brush and using it with homemade mascara :)</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a great mascara and this is it!!!  Next time I&#x27;m ordering the full size tube.</li>
    <li> This mascara is THEE ABSOLUTE BEST! It magnifies the eyelashes and makes them appear very long and full. Great great and serious volume.</li>
    <li> having heard of this and reading the no clumps and staying power -no flaking  etc I ordered 2-of the smallest size for my daughter and self..after a few trials I  noted all those things I no longer used mascara for and when I checked with my &amp;#34;in the know&amp;#34; re cosmetics&amp;#34;...her response, the same  &amp;#34;no more please.....</li>
    <li> Kind of clumpy and leaves raccoon streaks on your face after a shower, which you need to practically scrub off. It definitely made my lashes pop (they did look almost fake!), but the cleanup afterward made the cost-benefit less than desirable. You can get the same effect with a much cheaper, less &amp;#34;broken-hearted teenager at prom&amp;#34; post-shower experience.</li>
    <li> Too much liquid and not enough drama. I recently discovered www.youniqueproducts.com/lashedout and became obsessed with the volume and length of my lashes. Goes on like mascara, but gives you the look of extentions!</li>
    <li> This mascara makes your lashes look thicker and longer. I love this mascara and it lives up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Does not clump.  Gives a very natural look.  Easy to apply.  Does not smudge easily. non drying to eyes.</li>
    <li> Benefit Cosmetics They&#x27;re Real! Mascara Black mini 0.14 oz.  It makes my lashes so long and thick and does not run!</li>
    <li> It was difficult to find the kind of mascara you have to use with artificial lashes. This one is and it worked fine. It didn&#x27;t do anything extraordinary like some regular mascaras, but it did the job.</li>
    <li> It is very wet mascara. It does lengthen a little but forget using an eyelash curler with this product. It doesn&#x27;t hold a curl at all. I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t get the full size tube!</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever worn. The first I have ever used that does exactly what it says it will. I have bought more since in a larger size.</li>
