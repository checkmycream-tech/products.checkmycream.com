      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Not my best look, certainly.</li>
      <li>The storage bag is nice, too.  </li>
      <li>You can put a warm iron in it with no problem.  </li>
      <li>but it really nice that I can just plug this in without an adapter(which for heat based styling equipment</li>
      <li>and I wanted a nice sleek look</li>
      <li>It heats quickly, comes with a heat protective case, which is awesome, and it arrived very quickly.</li>

      <li>it fits in most of my bags and coes with its own case for caring and a heat mat which comes in</li>
      <li>This iron works great and is just the right size.  </li>

      <li>The heat resistant case is great for when you need to pack it up while it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
      <li>it takes longer to do my hair, and doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job as a full size/full power model.</li>
      <li>However, it works well and leaves my hair very smooth.</li>
      <li>One added plus is because this straightener is so small it does a really wonderful job taming my bangs and fly aways.</li>
      <li>The color and size are super cute and, although it works fine for a quick touch-up, don&#x27;t rely on it to give you a perfect style.</li>
      <li>I received this item super excited thinking it was going to be great.</li>
      <li>This baby croc is so cute and the perfect size for styling short hair!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I travel about 4-10 days each month for work, so I needed a travel flat iron to keep in my suitcase. I was pleasantly surprised with this flat iron and have contemplated purchasing another to keep at home. First, it is a BRIGHT lime green that is really cute, and comes with a magnetic case that allows you to pack it up while still warm if needed. The iron heats up very quickly and very hot, allowing me to run it through my hair and get the desired results in the same time frame as my larger flat iron at home. I do have fairly thin and straight hair, so I am not sure how well this would work with thick, curly hair. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a mini flat iron that will produce results that match a full sized.</li>
    <li> This little straightener works just fine.  It is very small, but for travel to Europe it was a good choice. Good price also, and worked throughout Central Europe with a separately purchased outlet adapter plug.</li>
    <li> Read all the reviews before I bought this and was a bit scared it wouldn&#x27;t work as well as I wanted it to.  It works great!  I used it traveling all over Europe.  Used it on our cruise and a few other short trips. It&#x27;s brilliant! Great for plane travel as it weighs almost nothing.  I use this as my regular flat iron now.  My daughter and I split a new CHI but she has full use of that now.  Not needed.  Besides the fact it is so darn cute.  I have the lime green. Love the color!  The heat resistant mat that is also used to fold it up into a neat package and the plastic zip up that it goes into make it the best travel accessory or just keeps it neat and tidy in the bathroom.  Great for work or to put in your carry bag.  Sending it with my daughter for competitions. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good little flat iron.  It doesn&#x27;t get super hot and it takes a bit longer to get your hair straight, but the space you save in your luggage is definitely worth the extra time spent straightening.  Overall, good buy - and who doesn&#x27;t love a bright green flat iron??</li>
    <li> heats up super fast.....great for travel.</li>
    <li> This is such a cute little straightening iron and I think it works really well.  I am going to be a good packer for my India trip with this small iron.</li>
    <li> Took this iron on a 14 day vacation and it worked just fine.  Loved the case it came with.  It packed well taking up little space.</li>
    <li> Great hair iron, but misleading in that a true dual voltage product does not require an adapter. This does, and that was not made clear upon purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect flat iron for my gym bag and/or suitcase.  The heat protecting wrap makes it so I can throw it right in my bag when I&#x27;m done.  Its small size doesn&#x27;t affect its function, and the color is fun.  My only complaint is that the outside of the iron gets a little hot.  For the most part, I just reposition my hand, but you have to be careful not to grab it too high.  Totally worth the price!</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron to use when I&#x27;m traveling.  Generally speaking, I have thick, short, Asian hair that is mostly straight, but still has a bit of a wave to it.  I just use it to smooth my hair out a bit.  I&#x27;m a licensed stylist, so I&#x27;m a bit spoiled by the effectiveness of professional tools.  This flat iron gets hot, but you have a wait a bit and even then, it doesn&#x27;t get my hair as nice and flat as my 1\\&quot; iron.  I usually turn it on while I do other stuff (brush my teeth, do my makeup, etc.) and give it time to heat up.  I can see this working for someone who has fine to medium hair with just a slight wave or straight hair.  The color and size are super cute and, although it works fine for a quick touch-up, don&#x27;t rely on it to give you a perfect style.</li>
    <li> This came exactly as promised time wise. It works great. It was just as described. Heats up quickly. You can easily throw it in your purse and take it anywhere.</li>
    <li> This is a great travel flat iron.  Why?    -Dual voltage.  Can be used in any country (I will be using mine in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan)  -Super-light.  It weighs nothing compared to my 1\\&quot; CHI.  -Small.  It&#x27;s really tiny but still has large enough plates to work well.  -Great case.  It lays out flat as a heat protective mat whilst you are straightening, then rolls up neatly with elastic bands to keep things tidy.  -Cute.  I mean, really, who doesn&#x27;t want to wake up and start their day with lime green?    and, most importantly:    -EFFECTIVE.  It&#x27;s a GOOD straightener.  It gets hot and hair runs smoothly along the ceramic plates.  You can straighten, flip, curl, and style with this cutie.  High-qualtity, great results.    So, yes, go ahead, pick your favorite color and add to your cart.  Now off into the great, wide world in style!</li>
    <li> This does the job, but I guess I&#x27;ve been spoiled by my much nicer regular straightener - I bought this to keep in my gym bag so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep going back-and-forth from home to gym with the same one. I feel this one does nothing to dispel frizz which is annoying, but It&#x27;ll do in a pinch! The size is great, and it came with a heat mat so that was a nice bonus!</li>
    <li> I got a baby straightener when I cut my hair and I was so surprised how much I like it. my sister tries to steal I too! I love it and it gets very hot. Please keep in mind that I am an African American woman with hair that is natural (in it&#x27;s regular state it is kinky and about 4b or 4a texture). This straightener gets really hot and you cannot control the setting so please use a heat protectant. You also are able to get really close to the roots. Even when I grow my hair out I will use this because I love it so much!!!</li>
    <li> This product is super light and tiny that it is great to travel with!  Plus it is very cute!  I went abroad to Europe with this item and it worked with an adapter.  The only complaint I have is that it didn&#x27;t perfectly straighten either my mom or I&#x27;s hair, but we also have very thick hair and lots of it!</li>
    <li> I bought this to take to Europe.  It is compact and comes with a nice little pad to protect surfaces from the heat. However I found that it did not really heat high enough to really do a good job on my chin length bob.  It is okay for touch ups. but I am a Chi snob and maybe I expected too much!</li>
    <li> I received this item super excited thinking it was going to be great. Little did I know it wasnt! The straightener didnt get hot enough! very dissappointing!</li>
    <li> This little neon gem is the must-have hair tool for the short haired girl. I have naturally curly hair AND a cowlick, which means after the blow-dry I look very much like a troll doll&#x27;s progeny. Not my best look, certainly. However, this slim instrument allows me to undo the frizzy havoc, smoothing and glossing and shaping each hair until I have that fresh-from-the-salon look. Also, it safely allows me to reach those short hairs around my ears and at the back of my neck WITHOUT singeing my skin. Huge plus. Beyond that, I adore the compact size, which is ideal for daily use and travel.</li>
    <li> This is a cutie pie piece of equipment.  The color brightens up a tedious task and frankly, the color is the real reason I purchased this flat iron.  After receiving it, I realized there were some bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it does the job which, no matter what color it is, is the most important thing.  It is tiny, so you don&#x27;t get that sweeping, broad look that you get with a regular size iron.  But I bought this for touch-ups and travel and for both it is perfect.  The packaging is amazing and the little carrying case keeps it neat and tidy when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks good, does the job, fits the bill...five stars.</li>
    <li> My old chi flat iron went out, so naturally I had to replace it. I won&#x27;t lie, I was attracted to this product by two things: 1. the color (yes superficial) 2. the size. I had this amazing little iron (that gets very hot in no time) for about a week, then my friend who is a hair stylus came over and used it. She fell in love with it, now I have to order another one since she is using mine in her salon. Simply put, this is one of the best flat irons out there, specially for the price!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely perfect for travel.  In fact, my hairdresser told me how happy she was with hers, so I decided to try one.  It&#x27;s great in every way, especially for travel out of the country.</li>
    <li> If you have some wild expectations about it then you may be disappointed as it is no miracle worker. However, for a travel item it is perfect. I love the color and the case. It&#x27;s neat and compact. It doesn&#x27;t have an adjustment setting so what it is, is what you get. It is supposed to be at 430*F and maybe it is but it just isn&#x27;t hot enough for my coarse, wavy, thick hair so it does take quite awhile to get it as flat ironed as I like. It gets very hot when in use, and I&#x27;m not talking about the plates, so you do have to take care in not having your hand too close to the plates. Overall I do think you get exactly what you pay for. It&#x27;s a perfect item for travel, touch-ups or taking to the gym.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife after her more expensive one broke. Originally, the price attracted us to this particular straighter. and as such, you get what you pay for.    Its small (as it should be for a \\&quot;Traveling\\&quot; straightener. Her only true complaint so far, is the amount of time the unit takes to heat up..    Overall, for the price, I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a flat iron that I could take to Austria and Italy because I was nervous about what could happen if I took the one I use at home in the States. While this one is not as effective as the one I use normally, it worked just fine for traveling and packed up nicely. I like the small carrying pouch you can wrap it in while it is still hot. This will be coming with me on our future travels and I have started recommending it to my travel clients as well.</li>
    <li> it really works on curly hair and it makes your hair super straight i love it and itts lime green who would not love that plus its light weight and heats up fast</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, it doesnt take a lot to straighten, but this straightener didnt get hot and didnt do anything for me.. I&#x27;m really diappointment, some reviews seemed great, but others mentioned the lack of heat.. Unfortunately my eurotrip was spent with frizzy, unstraightened hair. :-(</li>
    <li> This flat iron takes forever to heat up, and when it does it isn&#x27;t hot enough. In order to use it you have to run it over your hair vey slowly to get it todo any straightening. It may be cute, but it is NOT worth more that 10 dollars at the very most. I read the good reviews before buying this and I was very disappointed when I found out it was all a lie. Please believe me when I say this is not a good deal. If you buy this, you will see what I mean.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my hair has changed.  Now when I dry it and start to style it, it sticks out in all directions or is very wavy in places.  (My hair has always been straight.)  I wanted something little and easy to touch up those stray hairs.  The Baby Croc was perfect! The storage bag is nice, too.  You can put a warm iron in it with no problem.  Best of all?  GREAT price!</li>
    <li> Great size for traveling and did work and straighten my hair, but my hair is thick and it took forever to do because of the size. Next time I&#x27;ll skip the convenient size and just bring my full size chi.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron it&#x27;s very small and reaches the new growth very well. It&#x27;s s good product but keep in mind because it is so small it will be difficult to go through the entire hair because it is very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is perfect to reach the new growth of the hair.</li>
    <li> love the fun little size and it works perfect for travel. my only wish was that it came with an auto shut off saftey feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this right after i got pixi cut because my hair is naturally VERY curly and I wanted a nice sleek look and this did it! I was worried that like other mini irons it wouldn&#x27;t get much heat, but no! it&#x27;s great 10/10 would deff recommend !!!</li>
    <li> I use it daily in the US and worked fine using it in Europe. The heat resistant case is great for when you need to pack it up while it&#x27;s still hot.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend buying this, unless you plan to straighten your 5&amp;#34; long hair 3 strands at a time, otherwise this product is pretty useless.</li>
    <li> I needed a compact flatiron to travel and this was perfect.  It was especially nice to have the cover to wrap it in.  When I am in a hurry packing to leave a hotel it is easy to wrap up and stick in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> I have very straight thick hair, but when my hair is short, it tends to flip out at the ends. I bought this straightener to do these minor touch ups, and I LOVE IT! This straightener is very tiny, heats up quickly, and fixes those flippy ends perfectly. I was concerned that the heat might be too powerful, but I think its just right. I would definitely recommend this straightener if you&#x27;re looking for a quick straight fix, or flippy ends like me. I&#x27;m not sure you would like it if your hair is super curly because of the size, it might take a long time to straighten it. Overall, I am VERY pleased with this product. It arrived within 2 days of me ordering it online too!</li>
    <li> I traveled in Europe, Africa and Asia with this flat iron and it worked perfectly. You&#x27;ll need an adapter to fit the plug for the countries you&#x27;re visiting, but that&#x27;s it.  I especially love the color. When you&#x27;re searching through a jam packed suitcase for it, the lime green makes it easy to find. I&#x27;m back home now, but am still using this. I imagine if you have long thick hair and want to totally  straighten it, it might take some time to do it with this iron, just because it&#x27;s a little small. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dual-voltage flat iron for a recent trip to Italy - and it worked great.  It was small for packing purposes, lightweight, and I really like the cover which protects the flat iron and can be used as a base for it when hot on any type of surface.  I have long, curly hair and the flat iron&#x27;s width worked for me.  A good purchase, for certain.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener! It&#x27;s very small and thin in comparison with my other flat iron; however, it&#x27;s the perfect size for overseas travel- love the compact travel case as well. And the color- so cute! This seller was also very efficient with payment methods, as well as shipping.</li>
    <li> Its cute and works. Love the color selections. Wonderful buy! Will get one as a gift for someone else soon.</li>
    <li> I love the color.&lt;br /&gt;I love the size.&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t curl my hair as well with it.&lt;br /&gt;Straightens, but not as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;travels well......  good for little trips.</li>
    <li> Hot enough to make my hair looks great.  Totally portable, original color.  I really love it. It came with a practical bag to easily take it everywhere.</li>
    <li> I used this during international travel and it worked great for styling my bangs in a jiffy, the rest of my hair took a bit longer but it really nice that I can just plug this in without an adapter(which for heat based styling equipment it is not smart to do anyways).</li>
    <li> Returned.  Too small.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and easy to use flat iron, I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as described. You don&#x27;t need a converter (but will still need an adapter).  It heats up quickly and the case is great.  Definitely a great deal.</li>
    <li> Poorly made- the plates do not align so it breaks your hair. I had to go but a chi at the store and my hair thanked me. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Tiny, heats up fast and works great! I brought it on a recent trip home and my mom liked it so much I gave it to her and ordered a new one for myself! We both have very fine hair and it isn&#x27;t too hot either. Great product!</li>
    <li> This little travel-sized Croc has nearly replaced my regular Chi. I get excellent results curling my long straight hair with this tool. I&#x27;m on Amazon today looking to get a full size version. When you have small plates it takes a while longer to do a full head of long hair, in part because you must go over your hair slower than you would with a full size unit to compensate for the heat loss from the plates working on so much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smoothness of the plates, the ease of gripping the ends of the iron (little ridges) and twirling it without tangle the cord (it&#x27;s a 360 swivel cord). I bought this lime color because it was the only one available at the store (found mine at Ulta), but I&#x27;ve grown to like it - I travel with it and seeing the electric yellow-green color reminds me to pack my iron back up so it doesn&#x27;t get forgotten on the sink ;)</li>
    <li> I agree it is not as good as a CHI but it did a darn good job. I was in India and Europe. It kept my hair freeze free and beautiful despite humidity, in cold and warm weather. I will use it every time I travel.</li>
    <li> I love this lime green baby. It is true as many reviewers have stated, that it does take longer because of the size. However, if you travel a lot like I do, the size and weight is great and it heats up quickly and works efficiently. This is truly one of the best mini travel irons I have bought. I have bought other travel curling irons and flat irons, and none of them have worked as easily and well as this one.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased, and I have quite a few.  My hair comes out just as good as when I go to the salon. It takes little time to heat up and is very easy to use. I&#x27;m definitely a fan.</li>
    <li> I bought this before a business trip to Germany because I needed a dual voltage straightener. It is incredibly convenient to travel with, did wonderfully in Germany and actually gets hot enough to style my hair. One added plus is because this straightener is so small it does a really wonderful job taming my bangs and fly aways. I have been recommending it to all of my friends who needed a dual voltage straightener.</li>
    <li> This flatiron is perfect for bangs and even better for travel. It even comes with a heat mat to place it on and wrap it up with when you are ready to pack up and head back home.  No more sitting around waiting for it to cool off.</li>
    <li> I love this mini iron.  Great for getting close the roots and for edges.  The first thing I noticed was that it did not snag or pull my hair.  That is a huge plus.  Also, I like that it doesnt get super hot.  SInce there is not variable temp dial, the temp isnt \\&quot;too\\&quot; hot.  I know some people don&#x27;t like that, but for those who don&#x27;t really care for high heat anyway, this is great.  It was still effective for my thick coarse hair.</li>
    <li> The design is a little awkward because the power switch is on the inside of the unit, but the swivel cord is nice and it works fine to use at home. It&#x27;s larger than expected ( I should have read the description better - I just assumed a travel iron would be small). I already had a travel size Conair that I use daily (just to straighten my wavy bangs, so I don&#x27;t need a full size one). I bought the Baby Croc for my gym bag, but it&#x27;s significantly larger and double the weight of the Conair. So, I&#x27;m using it at home and take the Conair to the gym instead. If you&#x27;re looking for something petite and portable (and don&#x27;t need dual voltage) the Conair Minipro CS80XR is a better choice.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as a cute stocking stuffer - she loves the size, how fast it heats and how easy it is to take with her.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect Christmas!</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast, Perfect for traveling, Also perfect if your hair is kind of short. All around worth the price,.</li>
    <li> I love these they work really well considering I just cut my hair. Very reasonable price and the color is soo cute!</li>
    <li> Although really cute to look at, I found that it does not heat up sufficiently to style my hair.  Also, the rounded plates were awkward and did not really straighten or create a curve in my hair.  Compared to the T3 travel flat iron that I have used for a couple of years, this iron was a huge disappointment.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend buying this Baby Croc.</li>
    <li> My daughter says it works well, but wishes it was a bit bigger.  She also says &amp;#34;the color is really cool.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Purchased to use in Europe as my wife&#x27;s flat iron is rated for 110V only.  When it arrived I noticed the label showed 100V-120V only.  (I uploaded pictures to the Customer Images section but they have not been posted yet) As further evidence the plug is two pronged with one prong being wider than the other.  This shape is designed to keep someone who doesn&#x27;t read the label from plugging it into a standard international adapter.  These adapters are made for true dual voltage products that can handle 220V.  To use this flat iron we would have to also purchase a step down voltage converter.  This is the only item my wife travels with that is not dual voltage so we were trying to avoid buying a step down voltage converter just for this.  Also, if you read converter reviews you&#x27;ll see that they are not to be used with high watt products like flat irons.  I&#x27;m hoping Amazon will take this back without a restock or shipping fee.  I&#x27;ll update review once I know outcome.</li>
    <li> The perfect flat iron for short hair. Takes seconds to heat up and just a couple of minutes to be ready to go!!</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, the wife loved it. Need I say more? ( apparently so since I&#x27;m 9 words short of my requirement)</li>
    <li> Comes with a heat resistant carry pouch which allows you to use it and immediately pack away to travel.  It is very small but I didn&#x27;t have any problems straightning my hair.  My hair is fine so that may make a difference to some that have thicker, longer hair.  You can use in Europe and the States. It takes up almost no space in your bag.  I would recommend</li>
    <li> This has gone with me to a few places around the world and has been super handy for quick hair touch-ups. I wish the outer case had a clasp that closed the thing up entirely, but an extra hair band did the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought this in January of 2013 and used it in Europe twice that year with no problem.  It&#x27;s small and has a great case for putting a warm iron in your suitcase.  I continued to use it almost daily at home.  However, this summer I started to wonder why my normal stylist wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job on my hair; it just never looked right.  I finally realized a few days ago that the flat iron didn&#x27;t feel very hot.  I borrowed my daughter&#x27;s, and surprise, surprise...my hair was back to looking as good as it used to.  I don&#x27;t know if 18 months is a normal lifespan for a flat iron, since this was my first.  It was great while it lasted, but I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to save it just for my overseas travels.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the lime color of this flat iron! This is mainly why I bought it, but thankfully it turned out to be a very good quality product. It is perfect for travel and I have replaced my regular sized iron with this as well. My hair is thin and fairly strait already so it doesn&#x27;t need hard core flat ironing. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Great just started shorting out after 18months</li>
    <li> We travelled to Europe and that is the reason why I bought this item. It doesn&#x27;t heat up fast and because th elate is so small, it would take forever to flatten my hair. I should have just brought my regular flat iron.</li>
    <li> compact and worked great! Hot proof travel case came in handy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the price and reviews. Not to mention that I am a green fein &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it is a great little travel straightener and the heat case makes it ideal to pack after use without having to wait for it to cool off. I have had hotter products that work better, although it&#x27;s still hot enough to make me drop my hair after running it through just once.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this if you have hair that is hard to manage and requires high temperatures, but for the price and everything it is very convenient and hard to beat.</li>
    <li> I didnt have high expectations because of the price but after reading reviews I decided to go for it. I have never purchased a straightener but I wanted to try something new so I went with this one. It works as I would expect any straightener to. It heats quickly, comes with a heat protective case, which is awesome, and it arrived very quickly. What else do you want?</li>
    <li> I bought this straightner for my gym bag. I work out during lunch and needed a small straightner to fix my hair before returning to the office - this does the trick! It is the perfect size and the travel pouch and heat pad are perfect accessories for being on the go. The straightner heats up quickly and I am able to touch up my hair (get rid of the ponytail dent) in 5 minutes. It cools down pretty quickly and wrapping it up in the heat pad allows me to throw it right back in my bag when I am done; I don&#x27;t have to wait for the straightner to cool completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave this four starts instead of five is that I would only use it as a travel / fix-up straightner and not as my main straightner. I currently use a Sedu straightner as my main straightner at home and use this one for touch ups. It works great for in-between washes but it can&#x27;t hold up to the powers of my Sedu for the initial straightening.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 11 year old to use mostly on her bangs.  She likes it but would be better if it had a thermostat.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use - this is my first (and only) flat iron though so I don&#x27;t have too much to compare to.  However, it works well and leaves my hair very smooth.</li>
    <li> Handing little flat iron that I bought for traveling purposes. Especially helpful for  short hair and glides well for the price. (I do have a better iron, a Sedu, but it was well over $100 so in a different category altogether.)</li>
    <li> This is a  great size flat iron for easy packing for travel.  It has it&#x27;s own little pouch for easy storage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this almost everyday for years now and I love it! Reliable, great size, and perfect travel mat. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this bright little guy. Perfect size to use at home and on the road. The traveling case is incredibly practical, as well. Love it!</li>
    <li> Not bad for the size, and came with a lot of cute and useful bags for it. I like the heat protecting mat, and the color is amazing!</li>
    <li> what i didn&#x27;t like about it, is that the iron don&#x27;t heat enough. I read the reviwes before buying it, but it is not true that has the perfect temperature.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make waves on your hair, it is ok. But if you want this iron to straighten your hair, it will probably take an hour to make it and still your hair won&#x27;t be as perfect as you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the voltage. I live in Perú and it worked perfectly when I plugged in directly to the wall socket.</li>
    <li> purchased this to travel abroad. Works great.  the dual voltage makes it great for traveling anywhere.  It is compact and light weight</li>
    <li> Not great, it&#x27;s ok for travel. But no flat iron beats the more better types. I think if your on the go a lot, you&#x27;ll like it..I don&#x27;t for everyday at home.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to take on a three-week backpacking trip through Europe. It has limitations because of its size... it takes longer to do my hair, and doesn&#x27;t do quite as good a job as a full size/full power model. But it takes up very little space, and did a pretty good job considering how much room I saved without my regular straightener.</li>
    <li> I afro Cuban with a curly hair blend and have a shorter haircut so i needed a really good mini flat iron  Brought this item after hubby suggested amazon.com. Fell in love with the color and after reading other reviews. It heats super fast and the case comes in handy. I can wrap it up as soon as I&#x27;m done without burning anything. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> First of all, I absolutely love the color ! It gets hot pretty fast good for going out of town with and it comes with a case! Came pretty quick so that&#x27;s a bonus</li>
    <li> While I have very short hair, it still needs a little straightening in the morning.  This iron works great and is just the right size.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another.</li>
    <li> I needed a 1/2&amp;#34; or close plates for short hair.  This beats the CHI 1/2&amp;#34; all to heck at a fraction of the price.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to get the product and it was so worth the money! It straightens perfectly and it stays all day for me! I have wavy/curly hair and its thick &amp; long so it does take long to straighten! This straightener is quick and heats up quickly! I love the case it came with &amp; I use it almost everyday!! Overall, I loved this product!</li>
    <li> I think this is perfect for travel. No worries about power conversion overseas and while small, I found it worked really well.</li>
    <li> I may have had a faulty product, but it stopped working after 2-3 weeks. There is a connection problem inside the swivel cord so I returned the product. Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
    <li> I received this 3/22/13 and instantly tried to use it. It will not stay on or heated and makes a hissing noise. Ive contacted the seller about a refund. I&#x27;m so disappointed ! Its so cute!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the flat iron was exactly as described. I love it, especially for quick touch ups!! Would definitely recommened to anyone. Great for hair that is about shoulder length or shorter.</li>
    <li> I have really short hair and my other straightener was just too wide to do anything. This baby croc is so cute and the perfect size for styling short hair! And the heat resistant case it comes with is super handy.</li>
    <li> This iron is mid-sized between my tiny compact travel irons and a full size flat iron. I have naturally bone-straight hair, but prefer to use flat irons to style it vs. curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front is very bleach-damaged, the back is shiny and healthy. This iron is NOT for styling straight or fine hair. I&#x27;ve always used flat irons, and none of them have destroyed my hair like this iron has. I noticed the ends started to look a little cooked, and within a few days my hair was noticeably burned at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of how my hair reacted to it, it is a very fine little iron. The &#x27;floating&#x27; plates have a very slight amount of give, very minimal, but they are smooth and it does do the job. It just isn&#x27;t suitable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no temp control, so I will have to give this away.</li>
    <li> Love the heat safe pouch it somes in!  While it&#x27;s on you can place it on there because although it&#x27;s small, it is powerful!  I have fine hair and use it for my bangs so this is all I need.  I like how it can come with me anywhere, on longer or shorter trips.  Can fit in your purse or travel lightly in your suitcase.  I&#x27;m not one for a lot of hair maintenance, so getting bangs was a big deal, and this little guy has made my life a lot easier.  Love the playful design and how it is user-friendly.  It has one heat setting, so it&#x27;s easy for someone like myself to use: on or off!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine for touch up jobs on the run but that&#x27;s about it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough to do any real styling. Meh.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to India, since it is dual voltage and small enough to fit in carryon luggage. My other large straightening iron didn&#x27;t specify if it was dual voltage and was so big that I knew I needed another option. This little iron worked great! In fact, my hair was softer and shinier than with my other iron. I don&#x27;t know if that was due more to the water/humidity in India or this iron, but it was impressive! I have naturally wavy/curly hair and have gone through several irons in the past that just didn&#x27;t deliver lasting results. I was sure that this little iron wouldn&#x27;t cut it, but figured it would be better than nothing. I was shocked at how my hair stayed smooth, even during high humidity and days of rugged traveling. I may let this one take over as my everyday iron as well!</li>
    <li> I have several months using it and every day I like, its size, its temperature.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to all who have short hair because my hair does magic with</li>
    <li> Cute, but doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my clientele :( . I&#x27;ll probably give it away to one of my younger customers.</li>
    <li> maybe it was a voltage issue, but the entire time I was in New Zealand, my hair looked awful. The iron didn&#x27;t really get very hot and didn&#x27;t perform anything like my day-to-day iron I use in the US</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience to compare other irons, but this one sure didn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all. Not even if I went in tiny pieces on fine hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this iron because my Conair one fried/died and my friend had the white version to this.  The plates are a little wider than typical 1/2\\&quot; irons, but it does not affect performance. LOVE the green colour!! I&#x27;ll recommend this iron to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR TYPE: I have short, chemically relaxed hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up pretty quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Small size easier to maneuver&lt;br /&gt;- Heat resistant mat/case and travel case are a great bonus&lt;br /&gt;- Smooth surface of the iron itself makes it easier to define curls (hair wraps around and slides off iron easier)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The \\&quot;croc\\&quot; logo basically rubbed off after my first use. The combo of heat and friction practically took of the logo which I was taken aback by.&lt;br /&gt;- Hair snags sometimes between the plates&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as other brands. This is better for me but for thicker/coarse hair types, this may be a problem.</li>
    <li> I probably should have bought the 1/2 inch instead. Otherwise its pretty compact and easy to travel with. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just love the size of this flat iron and that it comes with a case.  I can just pack it with my travel on bag and know that I do not have to worry about my hair.</li>
    <li> it fits in most of my bags and coes with its own case for caring and a heat mat which comes in handy its so small it even gets the shortest hairs and is perfect for touch ups on rainy foggy bad hair days</li>
    <li> worked well traveling to europe</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t plugged it in yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will be fine. We have used a lot of mini flat irons in my house and they all seem pretty decent for the small jobs we need them to do. I just think it&#x27;s misleading to show a Lime green one, when what we received was like an M&amp;M green. Frog green. Not worth returning over, but I did see some of the reviewers said theirs were Lime; ours was not. I like the case but there is no way to close it after rolling it up. No tie or velcro; I guess I can use a rubber band.</li>
    <li> Love this little buddy. I am a professional cosmetologist I use this all the time on my clients.</li>
    <li> It is a great little travel straightener but don&#x27;t expect the quality of the full size Croc. One on/off setting and small iron area. It does heat up quickly though and do the job. Overall satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great little flat iron.  The color is fun.  It heats up very quickly.  I&#x27;m a male with short hair (reason for buying a small flat iron) - it really does the job.  The way it comes packaged is way nicer than I expected, especially for the price.  I&#x27;d recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> This is a good flat iron. Its great for traveling. It&#x27;s dual voltage and comes in a little carrying case that keeps it all contained and easy to pack. Unless you have short hair though, you&#x27;ll probably still need a regular sized flat iron. This one is good for touch ups though. I was hoping to use it as a travel flat iron but since I have really long hair, it&#x27;s impractical for me but that is not the fault of the flat iron.</li>
    <li> The item is great for short hair. But the best part was the seller had it at my door within three days.</li>
</ol>
