      <li>These perm rods work perfectly!</li>
      <li>price for great product</li>
      <li>They are great for curling hair, even synthetic hair.</li>
      <li>Lol nd</li>
      <li>This is a great deal in that respect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the rods are great.</li>
      <li>Good rods.</li>
      <li>Good quality perm rods.  </li>
      <li>that was my mistake but still a good product I would probably by more</li>
      <li>Now you have to factor in the shipping and handling charge and how quickly you need them to determine if this is a good deal for you at the end.</li>
      <li>sometime theb bands snaps but I;ve been able to fix it</li>
      <li>love the curls from these rollers</li>
      <li>I love the size and I received 36 rollers.</li>
      <li>They have not lost the elasticity yet, but I am sure the more they are used, the more the elasticity will loosen.</li>
      <li>They arrived in a timely fashion &amp; packaged appropriately.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to test the product out.</li>
      <li>Pretty good but the part that fits into the hole in the perm rod to keep it in place keep popping off a lot of them....</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t used them too much yet but good quality</li>
      <li>Worked like a charm, easy to use and easy to lock.</li>
      <li>These rods were easy to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used them once, but they&#x27;re great rods.</li>
      <li>I used the rods, which fit well on my hair, to do a curly perm rod set that came out well &amp; used all 36 rods.</li>
      <li>I love these but because I use them so much they do break, so I&#x27;m purchasing more.</li>
      <li>she has curly hair from her self and if she used them i would not notice, as long as she is happy</li>
      <li>These are great for natural hair girls for refreshing a style last minute.  </li>
      <li>, i&#x27;m cool with it.</li>
      <li>Wonderful packaging arrived earlier than expected</li>
      <li>They curl my hair very well and do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do!</li>
      <li>I actually needed 1 more package.</li>

      <li>my hair thanks you worth every cent</li>
      <li>Exactly how it is described in the description</li>
      <li>the product is great their smaller then expected</li>
      <li>Nice size for short (about 4.5 inches), natural hair.</li>
      <li>The only real gripe I have is the elastic sometimes easily comes off the attached rod when I&#x27;m trying to apply them.</li>
      <li>Lol..but other then that great curls were tight..</li>
      <li>At the time I purchased these, I had to pay $9 in shipping and handling because I bundled them up with different sized perm rods and the total cost did not meet the $35 minimum for free shipping.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My curls are full as expected.</li>
      <li>it actually set really fast...</li>
      <li>Normally, one dozen grey short perm rods are around $2 at Sally&#x27;s Beauty, but I got THREE dozen for $2.99 here on Amazon from Maya Beauty.</li>

<li> So people with long hair may want to take this into consideration.  </li>
<li> My concern is for my daughter who has long hair.  </li>
<li> It was smaller than I expected them to be</li>
<li> After ordering this product, I received it 3 days later, 3 days before the expected date of arrival.</li>

<li> I was unaware that they were the SMALL size</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is the fact that the rods were secured very tightly, it made it hard for me to open them with ease.</li>
<li> really tight</li>
<li> The closing elastic is tight and holds the rod in place.  </li>
<li> I have had the rods a few months now and used them two times.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t know they were this small</li>
<li> Just wish I had known they were small.</li>
<li> hard to catch your roots with the string instead of the clip on curls</li>
<li> Not much of a biggie, just really annoying.</li>

    <li> Good rods. Nice size for short (about 4.5 inches), natural hair.</li>
    <li> Pretty good but the part that fits into the hole in the perm rod to keep it in place keep popping off a lot of them....but hey, the got the job done!</li>
    <li> One of them snapped out of place</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PERM RODS, THAT GAVE ME EXCELLENT CURLS.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! broke after a couple use!</li>
    <li> These rods were easy to use. I actually needed 1 more package. i ordered 3 but needed 4.</li>
    <li> They do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do. The only real gripe I have is the elastic sometimes easily comes off the attached rod when I&#x27;m trying to apply them. Not much of a biggie, just really annoying.</li>
    <li> I was unaware that they were the SMALL size so I ended up returning them. They arrived in a timely fashion &amp; packaged appropriately. Just wish I had known they were small.</li>
    <li> Again stated these products were for my Daughter she has curly hair from her self and if she used them i would not notice, as long as she is happy, i&#x27;m cool with it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know they were this small that was my mistake but still a good product I would probably by more</li>
    <li> sometime theb bands snaps but I;ve been able to fix it</li>
    <li> love the curls from these rollers</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used them too much yet but good quality</li>
    <li> These are great for natural hair girls for refreshing a style last minute.  They arrived promptly! I love the size and I received 36 rollers.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but it does the job and they have not snapped like ones I have purchased from local beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> the product is great their smaller then expected but thats my fault Lol..but other then that great curls were tight..really tight Lol nd it actually set really fast...hard to catch your roots with the string instead of the clip on curls</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I expected them to be</li>
    <li> I love these but because I use them so much they do break, so I&#x27;m purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once, but they&#x27;re great rods. They curl my hair very well and do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do!</li>
    <li> Good quality perm rods.  Worked like a charm, easy to use and easy to lock.</li>
    <li> These perm rods work perfectly!</li>
    <li> just what i ordered.&lt;br /&gt;i havent used the item yet but it came in time, all pieces included. color was right.&lt;br /&gt;smaller than i thought but its just right.&lt;br /&gt;great price for great product</li>
    <li> The rods were as they were represented.  All perm rods are not alike.  these rods are well made.  The closing elastic is tight and holds the rod in place.  I will use them again and again.  When I buy a larger rod, I will buy this brand.</li>
    <li> To flimsy. Kept breaking.</li>
    <li> After ordering this product, I received it 3 days later, 3 days before the expected date of arrival. I was very excited to test the product out. The only complaint I have is the fact that the rods were secured very tightly, it made it hard for me to open them with ease. Furthermore, the tightness of the rods caused me to accidentally break two of them with my teeth while trying to open them. I used the rods, which fit well on my hair, to do a curly perm rod set that came out well &amp; used all 36 rods.</li>
    <li> Normally, one dozen grey short perm rods are around $2 at Sally&#x27;s Beauty, but I got THREE dozen for $2.99 here on Amazon from Maya Beauty. This is a great deal in that respect. Now you have to factor in the shipping and handling charge and how quickly you need them to determine if this is a good deal for you at the end. At the time I purchased these, I had to pay $9 in shipping and handling because I bundled them up with different sized perm rods and the total cost did not meet the $35 minimum for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the rods are great. They work as expected. My curls are full as expected. My concern is for my daughter who has long hair.  She can&#x27;t use these because they are too short. So people with long hair may want to take this into consideration.  I have had the rods a few months now and used them two times. They have not lost the elasticity yet, but I am sure the more they are used, the more the elasticity will loosen. This has just been my experience with perm rods in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the rods and would definitely recommend them. They are great for curling hair, even synthetic hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful packaging arrived earlier than expected my hair thanks you worth every cent</li>
    <li> Exactly how it is described in the description</li>
