<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great if you are expirementing with falsies or want a large variety. Every lash is different and long so you can cut them to size.</li>
    <li> Awsome, first time putting these by myself and let me tell you people swear they were real.</li>
    <li> I was worried that these would look too fake or plastic but I was pleasantly surprised about how great they looked when I put them on.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes!!!!!!</li>
    <li> For the price it is an awesome deal! They are delicate but look great.</li>
    <li> quick delivery and i love them ...great as gifts!</li>
    <li> The band is nice and flexible, and the lashes are pretty.</li>
    <li> Shipping was late by one day, but I didn&#x27;t mind that. Well worth the wait ;)  When I opened the package these lashes look just like how it appears on the picture. I can&#x27;t speak for all of the lashes because I&#x27;ve only used the 3rd and the 4th one (from the top). Variety of lashes perfect for when you want a natural look to a more glamorous look. Only downside for these lashes is that when you take them off the package it takes a bit of time to have them &amp;#34;curved&amp;#34; for your eye, or at least the 3rd one from the top did. I wrapped the eyelashes around one of my makeup brushes before I started putting on my makeup, and by the time I was finished the lashes &amp;#34;curved&amp;#34;. I applied it with clear DUO lash adhesive and it went on easily. They stuck on all day and all night. Highly recommend these eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one set, twice since receiving my order. The lashes are easy to attach and remove. They are full &amp; dramatic, exactly the look I want.</li>
    <li> My daughter was excited about receiving this product. It arrived when expected.</li>
    <li> These were surprisingly better quality than I expected.  We used them for a theater production, so each pair was worn 7x and still managed to hold up just fine! We will order again.  They did need a little extra glue compared to the real hair type strip lashes.  Letting the glue get tacky before applying to the eyelid really helps.</li>
    <li> I bought these because the rave I have seen about them. Normally I buy Ardell  or Red Cherry but since these got great reviews I thought to try them out. I know the price is cheap but people seemed to really like them. The variance is great especially for different eye looks. I tried one set and I usually can tell how good they are by just feeling them and pulling them out. My first issue is that they feel and look cheap. They are not soft and the lashes stick together. Second, the lash band is very straight and even curving this around your finger does not help. Usually I can put lashes around my finger to help mold them but these just got back to the same straightness  I guess is the word  lol. My last problem is that they are hard to keep on. I use Revlon Lash glue and this stuff is sticky to begin with, I know anything will stick with this stuff. But these pop off especially in the inner corner. In order for them to stay on you have to hold them in place until the glue completely dries. Now keep in mind also these are a one time use, so idk  how anyone could get more than two uses. Personally, your better off spending  the same price for a pair from  house of lashes that&#x27;ll give you atleast 6-9 wears and look and feel soft.</li>
    <li> Love Love these lashes... Very versatile for different eye looks</li>
    <li> Love these lahes !! Will buy them again</li>
    <li> I will let my kids use them for costumes (much cheaper than a set at a Halloween store), but when they arrived I could see the benefit of using them more generally.  I could see how I may be surrounded by people wearing false lashes and not even realize it.</li>
    <li> when i first received it i was like Wowww! super cute packaging,looks natural,i liked how they created one box where you can find every style of lashes.good price.i definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re lovely! Shipping was very fast. The variety is perfect since I like to wear a lot of different looks. And I will definitely re-order in the future</li>
    <li> Pretty cute lashes not all of them are cute I like the thick ones an u have to cut the ends off an there kinda hard to put on</li>
    <li> This was a steal! I am a hair and makeup artist for professional sport team cheerleaders and got these just to try them out and love them! Fairly good quality look great on, don&#x27;t have that fake shine look. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Best lashes ever. I love that there are so many different styles!</li>
    <li> I am incredibly happy with my purchase. I have worn a different pair of lashes every day this week. There is a selection of different lashes. Good quality. Easy application. Fast shipping (With Prime) Once I wear this pack out, I will buy more.</li>
    <li> I have&#x27;t tried these yet, but love lashes and these were a great deal.  arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> I bought to my wife and she found it amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Great gift.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> The pair of lashes at the very top are not wearable. Besides that the rest of the lashes are pretty cute.</li>
    <li> Love them so much  ... Love the fast shipping ..and. It was easy to apply</li>
    <li> reusable, durable, and a nice selection.</li>
    <li> Beautiful lashes! Will buy again</li>
    <li> Great set and selection for the price</li>
    <li> I love it! Good price and quality!!!</li>
    <li> Very stiff and plastic. Itchy!</li>
    <li> I like them but had trouble getting them on</li>
    <li> gift for daughter. Loved them. Simple looks to dramatic.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and the shipping was super fast too! I wore them in my recent youtube video at almost 18k views im pretty sure people will be logging on to shop!</li>
    <li> 10 pairs 10 styles.... my favorite lashes so far. I hardly use other brands after I used de Prettilicious lashes. Quality is comparable to Mac and Ardell..yet very good price. I will definitely stock up more!</li>
    <li> very good for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second order of these after 6-9 months or so.  These lashes are perfect, and they last forever if taken care of properly.  The customer service side of de Prettilicious is absolutely amazing as well.  They&#x27;re really garnering to your satisfaction, and I will always recommend them.</li>
    <li> these are good for Halloween or playing dress up, but i would never go out in them! they are big cheap looking plastic lashes. i own fake lashes from Ardelle, and compared to these Ardella would be considered natural! these lashes are for drag queens.</li>
    <li> good just did not know how to put them on.</li>
    <li> They look so great thanks keep up the great work!!</li>
    <li> The were so stiff and looked extremely fake, cutting them to size made them fall apart. I returned them.</li>
    <li> These lashes unfortunately were not the quality I was hoping for. They are cheap plastic. I love wearing lashes, it really is the final step to take your makeup look to another level. You can make these work in a pinch if you had to but if you are looking for flexible,  feathery and natural I would go with another brand. I will not buy these again.</li>
    <li> excellant selection of lashes at an amazing price!! will DEFINITLEY recommend this company to friends! many thanks Eunice!!</li>
    <li> Cant wait to receive this.it looks good in picture i just hope its good when i see them face to face</li>
    <li> Not heavy, thin band makes them look very natural. Easy to remove, can be used a number of times.</li>
    <li> My lashes came in no time at all packaged perfectly and I love the invisible band and quality of the lashes. I will defiantly purchase more soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a certified Makeup Artist. I have been using tons of lashes from different brands. I highly recommend this lash set. I received this 10 Pair 10 style Premium Lash Set last month from another experienced makeup artist. I repeat using them for so many times. All my clients are in love with these lashes. They&#x27;re in very good quality, easy to apply, dramatic yet natural. I love the varieties. You should own at least one set if you&#x27;re a professional makeup artist or a beginner. Compare to other brands, these lashes are same quality as those expensive brands but with an affordable price. I will order tons for my clients and students.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly nice! When I didn&#x27;t see the tight stitching I see on the eyelashes I normally buy at the stores, I was skeptical, but they&#x27;re very durable and reusable!</li>
    <li> I used these on two brides and their bridal party; everyone said it felt like they weren&#x27;t wearing lashes! They stayed on all night , I used the &amp;#34;duo&amp;#34; lash adhesive. Perfect sizes, perfect variety. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery great quality</li>
    <li> Perfect. Fast delivery.  I buy these over and over.</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend these lashes I&#x27;m am very happy with this purchase definitely will buy again:)</li>
    <li> I LOVE the lashes! I actually wore some yesterday! I like that they were noticeable but still subtle! I didn&#x27;t look crazy but it added a &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; factor to my look!</li>
    <li> I wish these were cheaper. Lol they are fantastic tho. I&#x27;d compare them to ardell, I like trying the different styles</li>
    <li> I ordered a box of premium eyelashes. Eyelashes are beautiful, package is adorable and the shipping is fast. I got so many compliments from my friends when I wore them. Quality is good. They are natural looking while still dramatic. unlike other cheap eyelashes, they do not look plastic. Love them. I reuse them multiple of times. I will definitely purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Still don&#x27;t know how to put these on... someone teach me? (:</li>
    <li> WOW! these are amazing im a competitive dancer and needed fake eyelashes and these are very easy to trim! and they also cams with 2 packets of each! wow u should get this</li>
    <li> I wear lashes every day so I have tried tons of different brands and these are great! Bands not too thick that it&#x27;s hard to glue on and not too thin that you can&#x27;t reuse. Love the variety or styles! Only thing is they are very long and I have to cut them to fit my eyelid</li>
    <li> Very synthetic looking.</li>
    <li> Awesome! So in love with these lashes. I have never found such professional-quality false eyelashes with this price range, not even near. These false eyelashes are DEFINITELY compatible with Mac &amp; Shu Uemura false eyelashes which I used to wear.&lt;br /&gt;I found that de Prettilicious is the only brand selling 10 different styles with premium quality synthetic fibres. I gotta tell that these Fibres really SHOCK ME, they are SuperDuper Light Weigth. I couldn’t even feel that I had these false lashes on. The bands of the lashes are thin, soft and flexible enough to easily blend with eyeliner. . It thoroughly solves my dull boring makeup routine and it instantly add a magic touch at a glance 😉&lt;br /&gt;Eyelashes are natural looking but luxuriously dramatic at the same time. There are dramatic enough to make a bold statement for newbies or for a woman who would consider herself a makeup pro. The custom-fit Arch features of the tray really ease my tiring day. The lashes automatically attach back onto the Arch Perfectly without any Shape distorted.&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, very fast shipping. Will buy again for myself and as gifts for friends!</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! So do my clients. Great quality !</li>
    <li> Gave it to my sister who just started getting interested in looking pretty and stuff and she loved it! Well, her and her friends…</li>
    <li> Very cheap qualty, the actual lashes fell off the strip. You get what you pay for with this one. Would be good for play makeup for kids though!</li>
    <li> These are probably one of the best lashes I have bought for a really good price! I love how it has natural looking ones for during the day and thicker ones for the night time! If you are looking for both, this is definatly a set to get!</li>
    <li> These are very affordable but are noticeably fake. The lashes are very thick and black, and even look clumpy. They are ok, but the Revlon lashes don&#x27;t cost much more and look more natural. You can see in the picture how the lashes look separate and clumpy on my eyes</li>
    <li> Nice, but ridiculously long.  A bit too fake looking.  Isn&#x27;t the whole idea to make people wonder if one&#x27;s lashes are real or not?</li>
    <li> Package arrived in a timely manner. Love all the lashes they&#x27;re so pretty and it makes your eye look so awesome. The lashes are long which is perfect. What I am looking for!</li>
    <li> At first I was hesitant to get these lashes and when I opened them I was still on the fence.  Lash band is clear with just the right amount of flexibility. The variety is amazing and they blend seamlessly into my natural lashes. Only complaint is that the lashes have a sheen.</li>
    <li> high quality. love them</li>
    <li> I love these lashes and considering the price the quality is really good.</li>
    <li> It is a good eyelashes</li>
    <li> Those r cheap so I wasn&#x27;t expecting God knows what. Some of them look too fake for me but most of them look good after you actually put them on</li>
    <li> I love them. They&#x27;re thin and think thick lashes just in the perfect places. they even come with short lashes (The bottom pair lashes) just for the center for extra volume which is AMAZING. The bands which holds the lashes are thin, which I like because it makes it look more natural. Shipping and handling was very easy, I got my package in the 4th day I ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed and I will order more once I run out! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love these lashes!!! Honestly, this is my first time wearing false lashes and they feel amazing! It&#x27;s worth it. :)</li>
    <li> Love it ! Very good quality ! I got alot of compliment from my makeup artist friend after wear these lashes.  I love it come in 10 different style, so I can create 10 different looks. I will definitely  buy more and put in my makeup kit for my future photo shoot :)</li>
    <li> these lashes are amazing! I always get compliments when wearing them! A lot of different styles and choices, only downside is no glue but that&#x27;s an easy fix!</li>
    <li> i love them there not to long and the blend in very well i just got em and i already planning on getting some more.</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome lashes! At first I was wondering how the quality would be considering how inexpensive they are, but sure enough when I got them and tested them out they were amazing! Some are for sure more dramatic then others but I think that&#x27;s good. You get to choose from so many styles and figure out exactly what you like. Love love love them!</li>
    <li> These are very cute and versatile. For some strange reason when i initially ordered these i thought there was more in the package.. I seen other sellers on Amazon giving more for the same price or less.</li>
    <li> Love them! I will order more!! Thank you</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s such a great deal, honestly it&#x27;s a steal and I don&#x27;t want to share for fear that they will sell out! The band is very thin and flexible, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your eyes.  The lashes are made of human hair, so they are also light and natural looking.  They may look funny in the package, but when you try them on, the gradient lashes look very pretty.  I have gotten lots of compliments on them! Also, the packaging is pretty, overall I&#x27;ll definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. The lashes feel fairly realistic in texture, the styles are really nice, I feel like they&#x27;re going to last me quite a while.</li>
    <li> They are okay. I found out that I am not a fan of synthetic eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Too fake for daytime wear but they look good at night.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! Absolutely LOVE them and for the price it was sooo worth it.</li>
    <li> I admit I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to get because I&#x27;ve never purchased lashes online before.  I am a lash fanatic and I can&#x27;t live without my falsies.  So when I received my lashes I was pretty excited.  In the box from the look of them the style and choices are awesome.  The only downside to these lashes are that they feel pretty stiff.  Not as soft as I imagine they would be but it is synthetic and not human hair.  Not as flexible either when you&#x27;re trying to bend the band,  it really doesn&#x27;t work with you.  So I find them a little harder to put in place but hey I&#x27;ll still wear them if I&#x27;m out of my other lashes.  Not bad for the price and if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for a cosplay, and they work perfectly, looking exactly like I wanted them to! And it rocks because I can use them for other costumes as well. They&#x27;re not sticky enough to just apply, you&#x27;ll need glue, but it&#x27;s not too expensive. Great buy, especially for such a great price!!</li>
    <li> Just love love it, So amazing and natural looking</li>
    <li> i like them. I just wish some of them where in a shorter length for day time. they were to long and kept hitting my glasses.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like these lashes. I really did. I got them and picked out the pair I wanted to try first. I started with whatever pair was fourth from the top. I went to remove them from the plastic mold, and goodness they were glued on tight. I&#x27;ve used about twenty different brands of lashes, but these were stuck down more than any others I&#x27;ve ever tried. And they are delicate little things. I&#x27;m very careful with my lashes--I know how fickle they can be, but these were ready to crumble from the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I switched to pulling them off with tweezers, I noticed some of the lashes had already started to fall off. That was okay, though, as that was the side where I&#x27;d have to trim them anyways. I did the snip trim, and the lashes started to behave like beads on a string, moving all over the place and coming off the end (which was funny considering how much of the glue was still on them from the packaging). I carefully spaced them out, put on a line of my eyelash adhesive and put them on. Beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stayed on as they should, did as they should, looked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take off my lashes using eye makeup remover and they peeled off perfectly. Then I used my QTip with the remover still on to wipe away excess glue--and BAM. Lashes moving around again. From a feather-light touch, too (I swear, it was gentle, gentle, gentle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lashes are now a misshapen heap, which is disappointing because I like to reuse lashes. I maintain my lashes well, and have used other brands over 10 times without them being damaged. I know I can return them, but in the end it&#x27;s more of a hassle to do that than to just one-use each pair and call it quits.</li>
    <li> perfect lashes for any occasion all different lengths and sizes .. will purchase again</li>
    <li> Love these lashes. were easy to apply especially when I&#x27;m a beginner. also looked beautifully on my eyes. If taken good care, you can get a good amount of reuse, which i have been doing.</li>
    <li> Considering the price these eyelashes are good quality.  The packaging is really cute and they were shipped to me within a week.</li>
    <li> It was Fast shipping and product is excellent. Thank YOU. :)</li>
    <li> Best false eyelashes I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> Received quickly, very cute without looking like a doll. (Fake). Lots of different looks for different occasions.</li>
    <li> They are so easy to apply and to work with I totally recommend them to everyone</li>
    <li> The price reflects the quality.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> These eyelashes were beautiful! I tried out all 4 styles and loved each and everyone of them! I needed them for a wedding and got so many complements on how beautiful my lashes were it was great!</li>
    <li> Love the variety of styles you could try. They feel natural and not too &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34;. I also like that the ends are extended so you could pull them off the plastic without damaging the eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes they are beautiful and well packaged</li>
    <li> Very beauitful lashes, they came in the mail so fast and they are stunning!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my young teenaged daughter who needed false eyelashes for a theatre production.  She wanted to practice and also wanted to have some for other future shows that she is in.  She looked up online application videos and then followed the instructions.  She did a great job.  She liked the variety in this pack for different uses. She can forsee herself using these for various costumes.  She was able to remove the pair she has tried so far and save it for another future use.  They held up well.  We are satisfied with the quality and price of these lashes.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product 10 stars, I would definitely would! I love this pack so much because all the falsies are very good quality plus I like the variety of styles. They are super easy to wear and it comes in an very sturdy box you can use to store used falsies. Yup, they are re-usable. I have very short lashes and not a super fan of mascara because it&#x27;s hard to remove so I am really heavy on falsies. I also use for my weekly performances and I don&#x27;t let them use other types of falsies on me. I bring m own and I am perfectly ok with that. sa</li>
    <li> The style and choices are awesome. And the price is affordable.</li>
    <li> these lashes are great. there are some very natural looking ones and then there are some that are way more dramatic. They are very bendable and smooth, so they look natural and not all plastic like. I have recommended these to people since they are a great product for a good price.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> These lashes are absolutely gorgeous!!! They are worth every penny. I definitely would recommend these lashes, there are many different styles and they&#x27;re all beautiful. There wasn&#x27;t one pair that I didn&#x27;t like!</li>
    <li> Not sure why these got such high ratings.  I found these lashes to be more fake looking than other brands. The bands are stiff making it difficult to adhere to slanted eyes or stay in place on the outter edges.</li>
    <li> Looveee these! They are sooo soft and beautiful... Definitely will buy again! Also fast shipping! Got within 3 days!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed!!! Super cute lashes that fit comfortably and you don&#x27;t even feel them, worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. The length of the lashes is not over whelming. If an improvement can be made though, maybe the lash strip can be made thicker since it&#x27;s a bit difficult to put it on since it&#x27;s so thin, it gets wobbly. Thank you!</li>
    <li> They are great - but they don&#x27;t come with glue.</li>
    <li> I love the variation of these lashes along with the length and texture of them. However, I find them to be a bit weighty at first but I guess that depends on the style of lash you choose to wear because some were pretty weightless. Overall this was a great product especially for the price!</li>
    <li> The product is excellent got it before&lt;br /&gt;expected ship date</li>
    <li> Tons of variety and all are as pictured. They&#x27;re slightly stiff, so getting the edges down is just a little more patience but overall they were comfortable as fake eyelashes can be and looked great on. Definitely a great deal!</li>
    <li> Fun lashes. A bit dramatic though. Might be fun in Vegas or a night out but too big and thick for day use or a wedding look.</li>
    <li> It is so beautiful and I will purchase more!</li>
    <li> Love that there&#x27;s a variety. I can use the smallest one for daily use and the thicker ones for a night out.</li>
    <li> Go on easy and love the selection</li>
    <li> Pretty &amp; natural looking.  Packaged well &amp; fast delivery.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very pretty and arrived on time !</li>
    <li> I love love them! You just have to cut them down a bit. But they are so pretty on and give your look more glam! I love them!</li>
    <li> Four stars only because…&lt;br /&gt;One pair of lashes were damaged during shipping I guess and the box was smashed, caving in on the left side.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was considerably fast!&lt;br /&gt;:) I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of the lashes!</li>
    <li> I received my lashes and they are amazing.  So many different types for different occasions! (:</li>
    <li> Some of the lashes are designed to be a little too obvious or &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; in some places. but overall, i like them.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality , not worth what I paid.</li>
    <li> I like them so far I&#x27;ve only worn 2 pairs of lashes. I like that it has options for me like dramatic to natural and everything in between.</li>
    <li> Great Item! Recommended! Quick shipping! High Quality! As Expected!</li>
    <li> Very nice lashes. Good variety! I really will buy this again in the future when I run out, yet it is pricey for me.  I like how soft the lashes are but not the band itself..its okay. My eyes are very sensitive to lashes so its a hit or miss for me. Overall, I do love it.</li>
    <li> Lashes are awesome and great quality. Nice variety. And it came right on time. I appreciate the on time shopping and the actual quality of the product!</li>
    <li> Love it !!! And i like that the lash line (where we put the glow ) is very very thin so its veeeery light on the eye u cant feel it on ur eyez :D !</li>
    <li> I waisted my money. I can&#x27;t wear these at all. The product looks like clumps of melted plastic.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! Easy to use and u get a variety for such a great price! I find them to similar to ardell lashes.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, Quick Delivery</li>
    <li> Everything as expected</li>
    <li> Love these! They are silkier than Ardell lashes and have a thin base so they stay on good . I have tried so many lashes and I love the variety and quality for this price is amazing !</li>
    <li> My 17 year old daughter wanted these and loves them. They are such a good price I ordered them. Make sure you get the right glue and remover.</li>
    <li> Very pretty packaging! The lashes are super cute and totally worth the money. I definitely will be buying some more.</li>
    <li> Exceptional quality and exactly what I ordered. Extremely happy</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are the best that I have seen!  They are perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought these with the duo eyelash glue and they are both amazing products. Alive that there were 12 different styles and I recommend anyone using falsies fir the first time to use this so they can see what style they like best.</li>
    <li> Great product. Lasts long if take care of. Love the variety!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product!</li>
    <li> After I got these lashes I hardly reach other brand. They&#x27;re very easy to put on. Some of the styles I have never seen in the market so far. I love every single pair! This set is a winner for me!</li>
    <li> They look nice and like the variety. I usually have to trim the full sized lashes to fit my eye length better.</li>
    <li> Pro MUA gives these 5 stars. Nice soft falsies to fit any occasion. I pair this with the clear Duo adhesive and I&#x27;m good to go. No ugly band, just soft flexible lashes that trim well and look lovely.</li>
    <li> Love the collection in this set.  There is quite a variety.  I haven&#x27;t tried them yet but have a date coming up.  This looks like a great collection to give you a good idea which style might fit with your look.  Now which one do I select?</li>
    <li> Ugh i love these for every day wear. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Human hair to Mink and those are just perfect and super lightweight for the price</li>
    <li> came super quick and they look great cant wait to try them</li>
    <li> Natural and very easy to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I rate it as 5 star product :)</li>
    <li> These lashes are lovely. Wore them to a rave &amp; they stayed on all night. It&#x27;s amazing that they come with so many different variations of lashes.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these one for my princess and one for my mistress my princess blows me away every time she flutters her eyelids and was absolutely delighted with the quality of the product. My mistress was also very pleased unfortunately I didn&#x27;t get spanked but I guess everybody is entitled to an off day. But she also was very pleased with the quality of the product and the fact that they are able to be used over and over. I personally still think that they just look like furry caterpillars, I would like to know if they are any use when it comes to fly fishing?</li>
