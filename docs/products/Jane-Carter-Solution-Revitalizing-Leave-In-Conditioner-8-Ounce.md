      <li>but it is very light.</li>
      <li>i love this product i use it after i shampoo and condition my hair</li>
      <li>The one thing that I want Jane Carter to do is create a cream based version of this for more control of the product and the winter/fall months for that</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>For the price, I had hoped to get more out of it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Try it out if you&#x27;re looking for a light leave-in!</li>
      <li>But just works ok on my daughters curls (she has corkscrew curls)</li>
      <li>The hair is healthier and has more sheen.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, it is not over powering.  </li>
      <li>My hair was actually in a better state before I put this in.</li>
      <li>this is more like a hair mist/refreshener</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s holding up better for me than this.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this leave-in conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Most of the time it&#x27;s us not the product.</li>
      <li>This product is okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s certainly not a terrible product (not in my experience, anyway), but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again unless I need a detangler.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a refreshing mist.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This feels like it&#x27;s more water than anything.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>This product was ok it did coat my hair</li>
      <li>The mist could be a bit more substantial, but I like it for what it does, and the smell.</li>
      <li>So I spray it on top</li>
      <li>Like many, I was hoping that this product would work on my hair.  </li>
      <li>This product is okay.</li>
      <li>Will be repurchasing until I find something better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have bought two and both bottles leak at the top.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>makes hair soft and light, smells great too!</li>
      <li>This leave in conditioner is great for natural hair.  </li>
      <li>lol it keeps it mositurize and soft.</li>
      <li>I rated this product a 4 because in my opinion, it works best when coupled with other JC products.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the Revitalizing Leave-In by Jane Carter not only because of it&#x27;s incredible scent (couldn&#x27;t stop smelling the bottle when I first bought it), but because it gives a light moisture that&#x27;s great on relaxed hair like mine and really helps detangle it as you blow-dry.</li>
      <li>I am wearing a short afro right now and this works perfect for me.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>My hair felt great especially after detangling.  </li>
      <li>It is quite light, like a mist and with its chemical free ingredients</li>
      <li>I always enjoy the quality of Jane Carter Solution.  </li>
      <li>but you can mimic the conditioner light</li>
      <li>The scent is really great and it makes my afro really soft for the first couple of days.</li>
      <li>but the quality is worth the price!</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, but it made my hair hard as bricks.</li>
      <li>This product is great for detangling wet, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I ended up with areas that were straight and some areas that seemed to curl more than I prefer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I leave that on for about 30min-1 hour depending on what I&#x27;m doing and whether or not I sit under heat for full penetration.  </li>
      <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my hair except for making it more drier than before.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use Jane Carter&#x27;s Leave-in conditioner daily and it makes my hair smell so nice.  It is quite light, like a mist and with its chemical free ingredients, I know I am doing something wonderful for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it daily on my toddler&#x27;s hair. It leaves it soft and manageable. I use it on my natural hair as well.</li>
    <li> I have type 4b hair. The first time I used this leave-in, my hair was stiff. I had used it with another leave-in, a serum and followed with a moisturizer and sealant. So I can&#x27;t say if it was what contributed to the stiffness of my hair. On my next wash day, I used only one leave in and very little moisturizer. My hair was very soft. I used this the following day as a light spritz and my hair is moisturized and still soft. I&#x27;ve been using it this way and it really keeps my hair soft. It is also a great detangler. I will try it again on a wash day and use it as the only leave-in and see how it turns out.  Update: I&#x27;ve stopped using it because it still makes my hair stiff! I can&#x27;t reduce the rating so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s still a 4-star rating!!</li>
    <li> I always enjoy the quality of Jane Carter Solution.  Once again, I am able to use this product for the wide variety of hair types in my household.  Gentle and effective for toddler detangling and a great revitalizer for use with my son&#x27;s locs.  For natural hair products like these are unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Saw this product recommended on the[...] website for promoting african american type hair growth...this is my 2nd bottle, leaves hair feeling hydrated without frizzing..non of the mineral oils or other ingredients that only sit on top of hair but dont actually penetrate to moisturize..would def recommend.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying new products that cater to the curly mane atop my head.&lt;br /&gt;I have black/spanish mixed hair and it&#x27;s a hot mess when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;I used my Jane Carter Revitalizing Conditioner last night after washing my hair and woke up to soft, controlled curls.&lt;br /&gt;But, then I did something stupid. I wet my hair again to maintain the bedheadedness, sprayed more in and realized I had overdone it.&lt;br /&gt;So, I advise anyone to use the mist sparingly and not to do that I did. I ended up with areas that were straight and some areas that seemed to curl more than I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a strong citrus scent, but it disappears and doesn&#x27;t weight the hair down.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my hair except for making it more drier than before.  I have natural long black american hair.  I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I am wearing a short afro right now and this works perfect for me. I dampen my hair, apply the product and finish with Miss Jessie&#x27;s buttercream. My hair shines throughout the day and maintains a nice coil. Will be repurchasing until I find something better.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Works great on my 4C hair. Arrived on time. Never fails.</li>
    <li> I have thick type 4a hair and I was hoping to find a leave in for my very dry hair. This however is not it. After I washed and conditioned my hair I sprayed this leave in conditioner on my hair and my hair immediately went from smooth and silky to rough and tangled I had to rinse it all out. Not only did my hair not like this product, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell, it smelled like dish liquid. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a leave-in conditioner to soften and moisturize my natural 4a/4b hair.  It does a wonder job in conjunction with my essential oil mixture that I use to lock in the moisture.  The smell is terrific!!</li>
    <li> This is my staple leave-in conditioner. It detangles my hair and makes my hair soft. I also use it on dry hair--to comb down my edges.</li>
    <li> Adds texture and protects hair.</li>
    <li> Like many, I was hoping that this product would work on my hair.  As soon as I sprayed it on, my hair did a complete 180.  It was a tangled mess.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. I don&#x27;t really feel any &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; in my hair. however, it doesn&#x27;t hurt it either. I probably won&#x27;t buy again but it might work well on people with a different hair texture.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. I have shoulder length natural black hair and this product works best for me when I&#x27;m detangling my hair immediately after washing and condition. The scent is really great and it makes my afro really soft for the first couple of days. It doesn&#x27;t work well unless hair is already damp and your combing the leave-in through your hair. Otherwise it can leave your hair feeling chalky and frizzy.</li>
    <li> First time using it but like it.</li>
    <li> i love this product i use it after i shampoo and condition my hair i spray it in and i use it befor i put any heat to my hair .this product is good if you have dry hair real dry hair lol it keeps it mositurize and soft.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Revitalizing Leave-In by Jane Carter not only because of it&#x27;s incredible scent (couldn&#x27;t stop smelling the bottle when I first bought it), but because it gives a light moisture that&#x27;s great on relaxed hair like mine and really helps detangle it as you blow-dry. The aroma isn&#x27;t strong, but they should make a perfume out of this stuff, that&#x27;s how good it smells! However, if you don&#x27;t like floral scents, stay away.</li>
    <li> Jane Carter is who I will be using from now on out. This leave in conditioner is very light and not to heavy it works perfect for my natural hair. Get this product you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have mixed textured hair that is both kinky and curly (I am African American and Caucasian) and it is very dry like most curly hair, plus I straighten very often. I like this because my hair needs moisture very badly, and all of the products I&#x27;ve used for &amp;#34;natural hair&amp;#34; leave my hair feeling too greasy, weighed down, and my curls undefined. After using this, my hair is so soft, moisturized, and I can see that my hair is much more curly than kinky. They sell this at Sally&#x27;s and I will definitely buy it again as long as it keeps working this way.</li>
    <li> This product works best as a detangler.  It shouldn&#x27;t have to work as a great leave in only when mixed with other products.  I agree with other reviews that it has a pleasant smell. I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> To me a leave in conditioner is supposed to have the effect of a rinse out conditioner but have safe ingredients to be left on the hair for hours or days at a time this has the ingredients but not the conditioner effect this is more like a hair mist/refreshener but you can mimic the conditioner light hold effect with an oil I use coconut oil. The smell is awesome very floral very clean I would purchase again for the smell alone but not as a leave in it sort of just sits on my hair but its soft when it dries and very frizzy ( but i dont think its the leave in becuse my hair is naturally soft with no product since using organic products ). its also perfect  before roller sets either alone or with gel. Like I said I would purchase again just not as a leave in just a prep for wet setting the hair or as a hair mist.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is very light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave build up in my hair.  The spray is a very fine mist, which is enough to work.  I&#x27;ve bought about 4 bottles so far.  This is my new go-to leave in conditioner.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> This is a product that literally requires ONE spray over your hair. Some people I&#x27;ve noticed when using it are \\&quot;heavy handed\\&quot; and pump a few sprays of it onto their hair, which is a no-no. It&#x27;ll make your hair DRRRYYYYY, and it shouldn&#x27;t be used more than once a day or every other day. It lasts on your hair THAT long. If used correctly, this can really add moisture to your hair and help with detangling.</li>
    <li> I have normal hair but it tends to be dry in the heat of the summer.  Plus my scalp often itches if I use a rinse out product.  Not with this leave-in conditioner.  It&#x27;s all good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d use this more on the go than anything, keeps my hair tamed but volumized at the same time. (I have 3b hair with coloring) I noticed a weird smell with it but I got it from my older sister who didn&#x27;t like it (she has 4c or 4b hair) who I believed watered it down. Left my hair soft but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on this product I&#x27;d use it on the go or when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
    <li> im 14 months natural, the product is nice.. but i would not run out and buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;to me i would get the same result if i had sprayed water on my hair. i use it on my children&#x27;s hair now</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!! It works like a charm and smells delicious!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my Jane Carter Leave In Conditioner!</li>
    <li> Great scent and helps make my daughters hair more manageable</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for many years directly from Whole Foods and thought I could save money by purchasing online. What a BIG disappointment!! I recently got a bottle from Whole Foods and I compared it to the one I received from Amazon. The Amazon product is COMPLETELY 100% FAKE. First off, the labeling on the bottle looks bootlegged (like someone created a replica label and plastered it on the bottle.) Secondly, the solution in the bottle is 100% fake; it&#x27;s absolutely not the solution as the one I got from Whole Foods. It smells horrible and disgusting. I don&#x27;t even trust to use it on my hair b/c I have no idea what contents they put into this fake product. The one from Whole Foods has the same usual beautiful scent that I am used to smelling. The one from Amazon smells terrible and mixed with unnatural chemical solutions. I have no idea what these crooks are putting in this product. I&#x27;m afraid to use it on my hair b/c I have no idea what fake ingredients they put into it. It smells horrible. My hair and scalp are sensitive to unnatural products. I believe this could do more damage to my hair than good and I refuse to use the Amazon one. PLEASE BEWARE BUYERS. THIS IS A FAKE!!!</li>
    <li> Have been using for 2 years.</li>
    <li> This leave in condition is awesome and leaves your hair really silky and smooth.  I kept my fingers in my hair all day!</li>
    <li> This product will definately be a staple for me.  I love the smell, it is not over powering.  It leaves my natural hair very soft.  The product is light and does not leave a heavy build up even after using it nightly to retwist.[[ASIN:B0012NVE2W Jane Carter Solution Revitalizing Leave-In Conditioner, 8 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Great product to keep my locs mositurized. I would just spray and lather with some oil, I&#x27;m a jane carter fan now!</li>
    <li> I like this, it smells great. But just works ok on my daughters curls (she has corkscrew curls), I guess nothing really &amp;#34;detangles&amp;#34; my daughters curls, and this is no exception. I go through a bottle a week (my daughter has a lot of hair) and this is at least cost effective. Does not leave an oily residue which I like.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful leave in conditioner.  I have natural hair and I spray it in after washing and even when dry to give my hair some added moisture.  Great for braid outs and twist outs.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it as a moisturizer with braiding my son&#x27;s hair and also use it to moisturize my dreadlocks.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this leave-in conditioner. It makes managing my natural hair so much easier and it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Bought on a whim at Target when I was having an especially frizzy hair day, losing a battle against a very humid summer&#x27;s day. I prefer to use natural products wherever possible, and I tend to get better results from them, so I bought this because I liked the ingredients. The main base of the product seems to be aloe with hair-friendly herbs, and aloe-based products usually work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, wavy hair so a light moisturizer is all I need, but this product somehow leaves my hair feeling a bit dry and crunchy, even if I only use a few spritzes. This feels like it&#x27;s more water than anything. I get none of the softening effects aloe usually gives me. Maybe it&#x27;s the panthenol? It does keep my hair from frizzing up, though, which is the main reason why I bought it. I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent, but it goes away quickly. All in all, if all you need is a very light moisturizer or want to just keep frizzies at bay, this may be the product for you.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t show up as a verified purchaser because I was desperate and bought it at a local store here in Alaska. However I am giving this 5 stars because it worked wonders for my 10 year old daughters hair. She is mixed (black &amp;white) and has extremely long (to her bum), thick curly hair, which was dry and brittle regardless of what we would do for it. So yesterday I spent over $100 on hair products one item being this and all of it together worked so well I was able to pull a small toothed comb through it from root to tip without a single snag, and I do credit at least the ability to comb it out so easily to this product.</li>
    <li> This product is great for detangling wet, curly hair.  However, it&#x27;s lacking in the stand-alone conditioner department.  For the price, I had hoped to get more out of it.  You can use this with the daily re-hydrater too, but the product does build up on the hair quickly, so wash at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer Giovanni 50-50 leave in conditioner.  It&#x27;s holding up better for me than this.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and in good care.  This leave in conditioner is great for natural hair.  It leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This product when I researched reviews, people said it&#x27;s watery I might as well use water. Well, when I looked at the ingredients, I said it is a leave-in and the ingredients speaks for this product. Use this for what Jane Carter says it is used for...just that way. I guarantee you wouldn&#x27;t see any problem with it. I spray a little not a lot. We can over do it sometimes and think it is the products. Most of the time it&#x27;s us not the product. The description say straighter hair people can detangle with this. Therefore, I knew to detangle during my conditioning process; I put my hair in twist, rinse, then use this product. It smells great. I do mist as mentioned in the description to get that scent on my hair in the morning. LOL</li>
    <li> My hair was breaking off badly a few months ago.  Since I&#x27;ve started using Jane carter products my breakage is minimal now and my hair is growing. I highly recommend  the scalp conditioner and leave in serum also.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn expensive. The smell is wonderful.The mist could be a bit more substantial, but I like it for what it does, and the smell.</li>
    <li> The product its self is good. The bottle has defects. I have bought two and both bottles leak at the top. The substance is nice and it moisturizes but the bottle makes it spill all over the place. The product does not squirt out. Not sure why the bottles leak and does not allow the product to squirt out. Once you get the product in your hair it drips. It does not stick hand stay so you kind of need a towel. I have thick hair and when I spray it in my head it runs down to my neck from the top of my head. But the product its self is good but the bottle isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This takes out snarls right away and leaves hair with no static. I like that you do not rinse it out.  Highly recommended and will buy again.</li>
    <li> My stylist introduced me to Jane Carter&#x27;s line about a year ago.  Initially, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the leave-in because my hair was sooooo dry &amp; damaged.  I decided to revamp the products I was using on my hair and create a few of my own.  I rated this product a 4 because in my opinion, it works best when coupled with other JC products.  I started with my pre-wash regimen of my homemade hot oil treatment (grapeseed oil, avocado oil, emu oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil.  I then follow that with an evoo &amp; honey masked.  I leave that on for about 30min-1 hour depending on what I&#x27;m doing and whether or not I sit under heat for full penetration.  I washed my hair with the JC sls-free shampoo.  I conditioned with JC nutrient replenishing conditioner.  I then sat under the dryer with a plastic cap for about 15-20 min.  My hair felt great especially after detangling.  I then used JC scalp nourishing treatment and the leave-in conditioner.  I added a bit of my own shea butter, coconut oil, avocado oil, emu oil, grapeseed oil hair butter to my hair paying close attention to my ends.  I rubbed a dime sized amount of the nourish n&#x27; shine with 2 drops of the hair nourishing serum.  I used the wrap and roll to twist my hair.  I sprayed a little of the twist holding spray and sat under the dryer for about 30 min.  End result....awesome.  I know it seems like a lot, but I&#x27;ve been relaxer-free for over 8 years now.  It took me that long to know what my hair really likes.  I&#x27;ve tried Ms Jessie, Curls, Mixed Chicks, Kinky Curly, the list goes on, but the JC products seem to be the only ones that my hair actually likes.  Instead of just one or two products, all work great on my hair.  My hair is very dry without the extra oil, hence the pre-shampoo treatments and I love the extra shine I get from using the honey.  The leave-in works best when it is applied right after a deep conditioner and then later in the week to revive hair.  I have not been paid by JC, I just love her stuff!</li>
    <li> Made my hair dry up if I used it before my styling products. I have really curly hair so I wanted the UV protection. So I spray it on top and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Not thrilled with it bought as a detangler and did not see a difference</li>
    <li> I have tried hard to love this product.  I&#x27;ve used 1/2 the bottle out of not wanting to waste my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, the pump on the bottle leaks like crazy, so after 2 pumps I have more on my hands than on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I don&#x27;t like the smell.  It&#x27;s some strange mix of floral and mild essential oil smell and I don&#x27;t find it pleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, I don&#x27;t find it adds positive texture qualities to my hair.  I only find it adds smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I can do better with a simple Apple Cider Vinegar rinse and a dab of coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t re-order this.</li>
    <li> Use every day.  It&#x27;s a perk me up for my hair!  It&#x27;s light, brings my curls back in an easy to apply spray bottle.</li>
    <li> The product does not work as  leave-in-conditioner. My hair is still pretty rough and dry.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dry 3b hair. It does help detangle a bit right after washing and conditioning...but my hair is usually already detangled soooooo. Other than that I&#x27;ve only seen results when I use it to refresh 2-3 day old wash &amp; go&#x27;s. Not very conditioning for a \\&quot;leave in conditioner\\&quot;. It does have a nice smell. If I found it on sale or BOGO I&#x27;d buy it again...at full price? It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Best leave-in I&#x27;ve found for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Very good product . Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this leave in AT ALL.  It instantly made my hair hard, was not creamy enough and the citrus in it made my scalp ITCH for HOURS.  I like the nourish and shine but I think the one was a MISS for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on impulse from Target when searching for an all-natural/mostly natural leave-in/moisturizer for my type 4 natural hair. I needed one that would leave my hair soft, moisturized, and that would actually absorb and not leave residue on the surface of my hair. This moisturizer does leave my hair feeling pretty soft and it does completely absorb into my hair, but perhaps it absorbs a little too much! My hair does not feel very moisturized after I&#x27;ve used this. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily feel dry, but it feels as if my hair is \\&quot;bare\\&quot; - as if it&#x27;s on the verge of becoming dry and will need to be moisturized soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, it detangles well and has a nice, flowery, unoffensive scent.  It&#x27;s certainly not a terrible product (not in my experience, anyway), but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again unless I need a detangler. However, I suppose if your hair needs only a very light moisturizer this would do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Deoionized Water, Extracts of Aloe Vera, Comfrey, Watercress, Myrrh, Panthenol, Chamomile, Comfrey, Horsetail, Nettle, Rosemary, Hops, Henna, Certified Organic Essential Oil: Lemon, Vanilla Extract, Polyquarternium11, Soyamid DEA, PPG30, Cetyl Ether, Oleth-3 Phosphate and Phenoxyethanol</li>
    <li> The whole Jane Carter collection is just wonderful! I mostly love it because of its natural ingredients, I am trying to live overall a more natural life style, and the products fits it perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I am of mixed race, half black half white, and trying to grow out my hair without doing &amp;#34;the big chop&amp;#34; after years of using chemicals. Once I started using it in conjunction with other products in this collection , it seemed to bring out my natural curl more, which I have never scene before ( as long as I can remember my hair has always been heat treated to make it straight).&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was a little cheaper but the quality is worth the price!</li>
    <li> Jane Carter products are a staple in my hair care regimen. The line itself does not carry enough oil to bring moisture to my 4a/4b hair. Adding a little oil to most things can provide slip and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this leave in needs help. No amount of layering or oil can produce nothing but hard, sticky, wirey hair. My hair was actually in a better state before I put this in. I had to do my wash&#x27;n&#x27;go all over again after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it as a wash&#x27;n&#x27;go - fail.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it as a refresher - fail&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it as a moisturizer to spritz my twists at night before I go to bed - fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner upon application instantly coats and makes your hair dry and sticky. Almost like Aquanet hair spray on clean wet hair. (even after I added olive oil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leave in provides no slip. It does not provide curl clumpage. It does little to soften hair, but you cant come through or finger style through the stickiness. When dry, it feels the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not live up to the standards of the rest of the line. Look for something else curlies...or try the travel size.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a detangler, which it claims to be, but it left my hair feeling stripped. There is no slip AT ALL.  I would have done better just putting plain water in my hair.  I tried it again after showering and using regular conditioner, and I had to re-wash my hair, because it felt so dry and unhealthy.  I&#x27;m not sure what this product is, but it&#x27;s not conditioner.  I plan to dump it and keep the bottle for plain water, because I refuse to put it in my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, smells HEAVILY of perfume, nothing like the nice smell of other Jane Carter products.  What gives?</li>
    <li> It makes the hair more manageable and soft to touch. The hair is healthier and has more sheen.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky, a challenge well met for my springy hair.  I have a lot of gray hair and this is the first product that has ever given me that silky feel!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for your hair.  It helps with detangling and softens hair while wet and dry.  It has a wonderful scent and it has made my hair more stronger.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I bought this after being fed up with my previous very heavy and horrendously scented leave-in. I couldn&#x27;t stand how often I had to wash my hair and that it made me smell like a candy store, despite its detangling wonders. This, on the other hand, is incredibly light, completely absorbs into my hair, leaves no lingering smell, and detangles just as well if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware, I do not use this alone on my 4a hair. It is a leave-in conditioner to which I finish with a sealant/styler. I noticed that one of the most helpful review complains that it&#x27;s not enough for her hair when used alone. However, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily what it&#x27;s intended to provide for us with tighter therefore drier curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Try it out if you&#x27;re looking for a light leave-in! It detangles beautifully and has a very mild scent!</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful, but it made my hair hard as bricks. Before using this on my naturally curly hair, my hair had body, was soft to the touch and had movement. Now, it&#x27;s hard, lifeless, hard as nails and has no movement. It&#x27;s a waste of money - I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quality leave-in conditioner being that I ran out of Organix conditioner. I came across this product, researched some reviews and became convinced to purchased it. After the first use; I&#x27;ve noticed that the product is really good for de-tangling and for dry hair. It leaves the hair soft and even softer when paired with a complimentary oil such as EVOO or a serum like Organix Coconut Milk anti-breakage serum. My hair was recently colored and it didn&#x27;t fade my hair color at all; if anything it gave my hair a lively shine to a dark color treated hair like mine. The fragrance is very subtle, it doesn&#x27;t linger and it aids in good for blow drying. The one thing that I want Jane Carter to do is create a cream based version of this for more control of the product and the winter/fall months for that the hair needs something that sticks to coated the hair in order to protect it from extreme cold weather and wind; other than that its definitely a 5/5 star rating; it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product was ok it did coat my hair and it felt stronger&lt;br /&gt;but I needed another leave in  conditioner to go along with this one to help soften my hair especially my ends. I don&#x27;t have course hair  but it&#x27;s dry at times.  I felt like I should have use another  product to boost up  this one. It&#x27;s worth trying out as I might try it again and if I do I will purchase the whole line&lt;br /&gt;of her products and see how it all works together then I will repost.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel!!! thats why i use nothing but Jane Carter on my hair it&#x27;s the best!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this leave-in conditioner.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to rate.  After use I will re-rate this product.  Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> I purchased mine at ULTA.  I purchased this to use as a natural detangler.  What I like even more is after I use it on next day hair.  Not only is it soft and easy to comb out, but it gives it life and I can skip a day or two in washing.  I am trying to grow out damaged, over processed hair.  The smell quickly dissipates, I am sensitive to smells.  I have ordered the shampoo and conditioner and hope I like them as well.  I am caucasian with curly, frizzy damaged hair.  I was worried that it would be to heavy and weigh down my hair but it is very light.</li>
    <li> As others have indicated, this product is a bit mislabeled.  It&#x27;s more of a refreshing mist.  It detangles a bit, but not much in my experience.  If you use too much of the product, it will make your hair hard (likely due to the henna).  I have found that a light misting of the hair from root to ends, followed by a moisturizer (preferably some type of natural butter... I use a homemade shea/coconut/avocado blend) produces beautiful, smooth hair with lots of shine. I have combo 4a/b hair.</li>
    <li> Im very disappointed because i heard good things about this product..and it was a little pricey. Ive tried it twice now and it does nothing but make my hair hard and unmanageable. Matter of fact i have.it in my hair right now and i need.to go.wash it out asap!</li>
    <li> First, it smells exactly like Gap Heaven perfume, which I kind of like, but my husband said I smelled like an old lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when I read the ingredients I was like well there&#x27;s really no way this can condition very much because it&#x27;s mostly water, aloe juice, and a bunch of botanical extracts and essential oils, and panthenol, which is a good vitamin for your hair, but not really conditioning in a way that is going to tame frizz or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length, reasonably healthy Caucasian hair, and this did absolutely nothing for it.  Didn&#x27;t detangle, didn&#x27;t condition, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only reason to use it would be if you just love the smell and want to give your hair a dose of b5.</li>
    <li> makes hair soft and light, smells great too!</li>
    <li> This is not a good product for my 12 inch 3c/4a hair. I think when I started using the product 8 months ago I was around 6 inches trying to test out leave in coditioners to help maintain moisture and prevent breakage as I was growing out my color treated hair. It left my hair very dry, sticky, and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Bioinfushion, Motions, or straight up braid spray by BRX, and yes smelly jherri curl activator spray to maintain moisture.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with purchase!</li>
