      <li>I normally put it on right out of the shower and it keeps my skin hydrated and smooth for 2 days or more.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>The coconut mixed with vanilla is such an uplifting and beautiful scent!</li>

      <li>Since finding EO lotion I rarely buy anything else anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The lotion is gentle enough that I feel perfectly safe using it on my kids, too (they love the smell and ask for it after bath time).</li>
      <li>The lotion is light, absorbs quickly and leaves my hands feeling soft.</li>
      <li>It is nice as an all over body lotion if you aren&#x27;t prone to dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Smells good, works on the whole family&#x27;s skin (we range from very dry to very oily)  </li>

      <li>I live in the desert, and really go through a lot of moisturizer trying to keep my skin hydrated.  </li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re very interested in buying this for the scent that you see it labeled as, be warned it&#x27;s a citrus only scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fantastic fragrance with great moisture for skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I use it as a deodorant.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff so much!!!!!! It smells fresh and feels AMAZING. It will keep your skin soft even the day after you applied it. I normally put it on right out of the shower and it keeps my skin hydrated and smooth for 2 days or more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using EO products for years.  Their ingredients are natural and safe and their scents are fresh and light.  I particularly like the vanilla coconut scented lotion for every day, all over use, as the smell reminds me of some past vacations! The lotion is gentle enough that I feel perfectly safe using it on my kids, too (they love the smell and ask for it after bath time).</li>
    <li> I WAS GIVEN A SAMPLE OF THIS AND ALTHOUGH I REALLY ENJOY EO PRODUCTS, I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS LOTION SMELLED TO \\&quot;COCONUTTY\\&quot; FOR ME. YES, IT CONTAINS COCONUT, AND I DID SMELL IT FROM THE BOTTLE FIRST, BUT I THOUGHT THE TANGERINE WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE COCONUTTY SMELL. IT DIDN&#x27;T HAVE TOO STRONG OF A RESIDUAL SCENT THOUGH WHICH WAS NICE AND IT WAS EASY TO USE AND MADE MY SKIN VERY SOFT - PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THE COCONUT IN IT.</li>
    <li> This lotion is absolutely fabulous, It leaves your skin soft and very well nourished love the coconut it keeps my skin feeling great all day long.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells wonderful and makes my skin feel smooth and moist.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff it&#x27;s a really nice smell and it works so awesome for my son who has eczema!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I got some for Christmas, the Lemon Verbena scent. Which smells awesome, but kind of like Fruit Loops. And since I am on a no carb diet, that just doesn&#x27;t sit well with me. But the lotion itself is not oily at all and lasts through many hand washes. So I came to Amazon to look at their other scents. Lo and behold they have my favorite scent ever orange and vanilla. So I ordered it and was not expecting it to smell so good with the coconut. It is my favorite. The scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Lemon Verbena. But it doesn&#x27;t get gross if I keep adding more lotion. I love it!</li>
    <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve used,and I have tried a lot. It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I apply after showering in the morning and it keeps my skin soft all day. Love the smell too. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife and she says she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells kinda like those orange/creme hard candies.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  It smells nice and fresh and leaves skin&lt;br /&gt;as soft as can be.  Not greasy, just soft and stays in the skin keeping it soft&lt;br /&gt;a day later.  I&#x27;ve NEVER used a lotion as good as this one.</li>
    <li> I used this for YEARS until I realized it had dimethicone in it. I never had noticed it before, not sure if the formula changed. Major disappointment!</li>
    <li> actually kind of nasty smelling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the EO Coconut/Vanilla soap (in a plastic dispenser) and loved it! I wish they had candles, hand cream, everything in that scent; there&#x27;s also a very tiny hint of citrus that makes washing your hands a wonderful olfactory experience.&lt;br /&gt;But this lotion smells nothing like the soap - it is a heavy scent, with maybe a hint of vanilla..but not the light and tangy freshness that the soap has. VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great smell, healthy materials, no chemicals and softens skin. Since finding EO lotion I rarely buy anything else anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this lotion!  Smells so wonderful, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a slippery feel on my hands!</li>
    <li> Very light feeling lotion.  Smells great!</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing! The coconut is refreshing! It keeps your skin feelin soft and hydrated and not greasy feeling. You will love it!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is awful,not what I expected at all,however,I could not return it--or actually,I could have returned it,but the shipping was going to be almost as much as the lotion was in the first place,so,no,I was not a happy camper</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with any of the EO products. My sensitive skin only allows me to use certain products. I have to be careful with scents and certainly synthetics. EO lotions are some of the few I can use. The Coconut and Vanilla is one of my favorites. I love the scent, rather adding fragrance I just allow this to be my scent. This is also one of the few products that works for me during the Winter months.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion! The smell of it is out of this world! I like the way it makes my skin feel--hydrated but not greesy.</li>
    <li> This lotion is unlike any I have used before.  I live in the desert, and really go through a lot of moisturizer trying to keep my skin hydrated.  This lotion goes on smooth and is absorbed quickly into your skin.  Many lotions leave your skin sticky after application, but not EO.  Love all the scents--they are light and not overbearing.  Great product from a regular customer.</li>
    <li> For an expensive lotion you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d have a bottle that doesn&#x27;t leak all over the top</li>
    <li> The major scent is tangerine so the product description is a little misleading. I do like EO brands lotion though.</li>
    <li> Smells good, works on the whole family&#x27;s skin (we range from very dry to very oily)  I bought to keep in bathroom</li>
    <li> I have been buying EO products for the past two years. The body lotions are the best. The coconut and vanilla is one of my favorites.My family and friends are also now enjoying these products as gifts.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of this lotion I have used.  It has a nice citrus scent I like, it is non-greasy, and it makes my hands soft.</li>
    <li> Soft gentle scent, true coconut &amp; vanilla, not artificial.  Lotion absorbs immediately and makes your skin feel great and smell heavenly.  The best body products EVER!  I Love EO!</li>
    <li> I am cleaning out all the nasty chemical-induced products in my house and decided to give this one a shot. I absolutely love the smell!!! Vanilla, coconut, with a hint of tangerine got me hooked! The lotion is light, absorbs quickly and leaves my hands feeling soft. Too bad the scent didn&#x27;t last a lot longer, but oh well. Good job on this one EO!!</li>
    <li> READ THE TINY LABLE in the yellow at the bottom of the bottle in the picture.  WITH TANGERINE!  Surprise!  The listing title does not indicate this at time of ordering, or at time of review, 2/5/13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprise scent aside, it smells very nice, super light, clean, and natural.&lt;br /&gt;Texture is great, very smooth and light, non-greasy.  It is nice as an all over body lotion if you aren&#x27;t prone to dry skin.  It does not work so well if your hands are overly dry from a day of chores, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ran out of face cream I would not hesitate to use this in it&#x27;s place due to the light scent, non-greasiness, and awesome ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;I could see the tangerine fragrance being irritating to very sensitive skin (I consider myself mildly sensitive, but it hasn&#x27;t bothered me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend, leaving out 1 star since it could be more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> We love this lotion in our family.  Found it on the good guide site.  Safe, absorbs quickly, and smells nice.  A winner.</li>
    <li> Very thin, watery.  So-so in terms of moisturizing.  I bought this because I wanted a coconut scent, but it&#x27;s a very, very, very strong tangerine scent.  I actually like the scent, but it is stroooong.  Bought this for after showering, but am going to use it up at my desk instead.</li>
    <li> Ingredient list is incomplete. This contains dimethicone. Smells great but had to return as I am allergic to dimethicone. Disappointed that this company uses this ingredient, as I love the fragrance of their products.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best lotion I have ever used.  The smell is truly wonderful.  The lotion goes on easily, absorbs quickly, hydrates well, and is not in the least bit greasy.  And the pump cap makes it so convenient.  Highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> Very rich and creamy - not greasy - easily absorbed by skin. Nice scent, not too strong. I have wanted to try EO products and this product is heavenly!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Not greasy and smells good.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great quality and feels very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells only of &amp;#34;tangerine&amp;#34; and not at all of coconut and vanilla. So if you&#x27;re very interested in buying this for the scent that you see it labeled as, be warned it&#x27;s a citrus only scent.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly.  Smells great.  Keeps skin moist. I use it for my garden hands, and it&#x27;s as effective as hand creams.  Safe product according to EWG. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazing!  To me it smells like the perfect balance between citrus and coconut.  Neither scent is overpowering or too sweet.  The lotion isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky and works great on my very dry hands.  Now I&#x27;m looking to buy all of the other items that EO makes in this scent.  That&#x27;s how great it is!</li>
    <li> I had previously only used their lavender line (which btw is the best lavender i&#x27;ve tried) I usually don&#x27;t go for coconut scents because they are usually too strong and sickening for me. THIS however is so pleasant and light you can put it on your whole body its not too strong. The coconut mixed with vanilla is such an uplifting and beautiful scent! Its a must try...hydrates well and blends easily (not greasy) Thanks again EO! Can&#x27;t wait to also try the coconut and vanilla shower gel now!!!</li>
