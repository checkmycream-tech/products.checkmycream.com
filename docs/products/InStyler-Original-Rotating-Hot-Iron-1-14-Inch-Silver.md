      <li>But I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s just my hair because nothing keeps it from frizzing, no heat tool, no products, nothing.</li>
      <li>No, no, no.....my straight iron works so much better.</li>

      <li>I have been using one for years, makes your hair shine and soft looking.  </li>
      <li>This particular order is to replace a three year old InStyler that was used daily and dropped on occasion.</li>

    <li> Better than advertised</li>
    <li> I have been using one for years, makes your hair shine and soft looking.  I have thick hair, it does take some time but what doesn&#x27;t. I have had mine for about 7 or 8 years, it still heats up and I still use it but the rotating quit. I will be ordering another one.</li>
    <li> I like this because i dont have to brush my hair in the morning because there is already a brush on the straightner so that defenitaly comes in handy❤️</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of InStylers. I own both sizes and wouldn&#x27;t be without. This particular order is to replace a three year old InStyler that was used daily and dropped on occasion. My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own. This is the ONLY product that has ever been any use at all on my very fine, very fuzzy hair. I love it, I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Better for someone with thicker/wavy hair.</li>

    <li> Works well on my thick, coarse hair.  I have arthritis in my hands and this is easier for me to use than a regular flatiron</li>
    <li> Best thing for your hair.  Dosnt tangle or burn hair</li>
    <li> This is my third original instyler! Works great for my naturally very curly, frizzy hair. It also makes my hair soft and silky instead of the drying out of a straight iron.</li>
    <li> Works OK in straightening my hair but it does not stay straightened like using a flat iron does.  Expensive tool just to try out on my hair.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE! I have very thick long hair down to my butt. This thing advertises that it is better and does your hair quicker for long hair it does not!! I spent an hour and half suffered a few severe burns and when I looked into the mirror my hair was a poofy frizzy mess. I had to go back over my hair with my chi. Returned it the very next day. Also it says the rotating will not pull your hair out... it did. I did not try any of the curling functions just the straightening but I was not impresses especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It worked awesome provided one should know the technique and take proper steps before heating own hair........</li>
    <li> My wife love it, She can change her look just in 5 minutes. Good Quality, delivery on time</li>
    <li> I have long thick wavy/curly hair (down to my waist). I love the look of straight hair but regular flat irons just don&#x27;t do the job and trust me I have 5 of them  from various brands, sizes, and heat settings. My mom gave me my instyler after I begged her for it after the first time I used it! It really straightened my hair in a short amount of time. Sadly though I still have no luck with it not frizzing my hair. But I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s just my hair because nothing keeps it from frizzing, no heat tool, no products, nothing. I will never buy another straightener, when this one dies on me I will buy a newer version of it!</li>
