      <li>The product is also very light weight.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
      <li>It does add body to my hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
      <li>Also, for best results, use a diffuser on low and just scrunch the hair for waves and volume.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Redken product for many years.  </li>
      <li>This product helps my fine hair have some body and sure helps with the styling process.  </li>
      <li>I am glad this formulation is still available.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion and was relieved to find it on Amazon as it is no longer available in stores or salons.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of medium length fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have a ton of fine, colored hair~medium length.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but I have allot of hair.  </li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>Love this product, it really helps build body in my very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Have been using for a few years now and was so happy to see this at this price!</li>
      <li>An effective product for what it does, but not for those with sensitive skin - whatever chemicals are in here just don&#x27;t agree with my body.</li>
      <li>really does its job and this bottle is a great size to last for a while.</li>
      <li>I cannot believe how much body this product adds to my baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>1 pea size dollop and 5 minutes worth of blow drying</li>
      <li>My wife rellay enjoyed this product has used in the past and was glad was still available on AMAZON.</li>
      <li>But, like another reviewer, I&#x27;m willing to pay that price since I have literally tried almost everything on the market, and this is the only product that thickens my hair and keeps my hair from being all flyaway while still being able to run your hands through it.</li>
      <li>and now I have enough for many years because the size was 3 times the one I had.  </li>
      <li>Redken has recently become a favorite brand of mine.</li>
      <li>I purchased the 16.9 oz bottle a year ago and still have more than 3/4 of the bottle left.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the results that this product offers me &amp; will continue to keep it as a staple.</li>
      <li>Usually the web prices are good and</li>
      <li>hasn&#x27;t bothered me and certainly I notice no odour 5 minutes after</li>
      <li>Very high humidity.</li>
      <li>I have thin baby fine hair, I got introduced to this lotion many years ago and it is the only product of many I have tried in the interim to give my hair body and lift.  </li>
      <li>I like it because they are delivered directly to my doorstep, but a $13 premium isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
      <li>The trick is don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and they don&#x27;t give my fine hair any extra volume or bounce.  </li>
      <li>Purchased it based on other reviews here, and I will admit it does give more body to my hair.</li>
      <li>If I accidentally use more than a pea size, my chin length hair will look matted down and greasy.</li>
      <li>(And, yes I use Redken products &amp; rinse well, not encountering this prob til I began using this particular product)</li>
      <li>Great for thin hair, I don&#x27;t use it every day, but once it dries and you brush it out, hair is much softer than with other thickeners and fillers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does add body to very fine hair leaving the texture thicker, but I have not noticed any improvement in shine; in fact, my hair is a little more dull with it; but the extra body is so much appreciated that I am willing to let go of a little shine.</li>
      <li>This is the older version of the product &amp; I actually prefer this one over the supposed new &amp; improved one.</li>
      <li>and this is the only product I have found that really, truly makes it look and feel thicker.</li>
      <li>All you need is a little pea sized dopple because any more &amp; it will work in reverse &amp; you will be a flat head.</li>
      <li>Have recently purchased other mousse products and nothing compares to this as far as making hair non fly away and thick.</li>
      <li>so I use very little and only on the longer hair on the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;The smell</li>
      <li>If I have the bottle too long product does tend to clump together but very economic buying it in this large container versus smaller more expensive ones.</li>
      <li>I use it right after washing my hair, but if I need a bit of styling between shampoos, I can just wet down again and lift right back up without adding any additional product,</li>
      <li>This product gives my hair an extra boost and it still feels and looks natural, like there is no product in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I apply it while my hair is damp (particularly in the crown area) and blow dry it for extra body and hold.  </li>
      <li>I have a short pixie cut and VERY fine (and unfortunately thinning)  hair.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and usually buy it at my salon, but through Amazon, it is half the price!</li>

<li> They just do nothing or leave my hair feeling heavy.  </li>
<li> This product provides volume without making my hair heavy and/or greasy.</li>
<li> Made my hair feel greasy and heavy</li>

    <li> I have thin baby fine hair, I got introduced to this lotion many years ago and it is the only product of many I have tried in the interim to give my hair body and lift.  I use it right after washing my hair, but if I need a bit of styling between shampoos, I can just wet down again and lift right back up without adding any additional product, something nothing else allows.  It holds well enough to eliminate the need for hairspray for everyday styling in a short or bob cut.</li>
    <li> leaves hair dull and sticky!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do my hair without out this.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this to me after I went to her lamenting about my thin hair. 1 pea size dollop and 5 minutes worth of blow drying later, my hair looks 50% thicker. The trick is don&#x27;t use too much. If I accidentally use more than a pea size, my chin length hair will look matted down and greasy. Also, for best results, use a diffuser on low and just scrunch the hair for waves and volume. I purchased the 16.9 oz bottle a year ago and still have more than 3/4 of the bottle left. THe smell is pleasant and mild. An everyday staple that actually does what it promises!</li>
    <li> This product helps my fine hair have some body and sure helps with the styling process.  I have used it for years and never go without it.</li>
    <li> This product provides volume without making my hair heavy and/or greasy. I love it! Redken has recently become a favorite brand of mine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have ordered it several times &amp; use it on my hair with every wash prior to styling. It saves me a lot of time when styling my hair.</li>
    <li> Wish they still made this...</li>
    <li> Does add thickness to my very thin hair. If I have the bottle too long product does tend to clump together but very economic buying it in this large container versus smaller more expensive ones. Have recently purchased other mousse products and nothing compares to this as far as making hair non fly away and thick.</li>
    <li> Have been using for a few years now and was so happy to see this at this price!</li>
    <li> I use this product faithfully and would recommend it to anyone who needs a little volume added to their hair. All you need is a little pea sized dopple because any more &amp; it will work in reverse &amp; you will be a flat head. This is the older version of the product &amp; I actually prefer this one over the supposed new &amp; improved one. You know some of us don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; change bur in actuality it is my hair that like the old the best. This is a bargain price too which makes it even better!!</li>
    <li> I have used it for years and although the bottle color has changed, it appears to be the same formulation.  I am glad this formulation is still available.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Works great on my fine, thinning hair!!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily. It was recommended by my hairstylist and works to add body and protect during blow drying.</li>
    <li> Great for thin hair, I don&#x27;t use it every day, but once it dries and you brush it out, hair is much softer than with other thickeners and fillers. This big bottle lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Product as described. Rapid turn around. A++++++++++ seller.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. It does add body to my hair and makes it more manageable.</li>
    <li> for any person with fine hair, this is the best leave in conditioner I have found!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and usually buy it at my salon, but through Amazon, it is half the price!</li>
    <li> I have very them limp hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel greasy and heavy</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on me after a haircut and it only takes a tiny amount to do the job as my hair is cut very short for the summer...but..the smell bothers me.. it smells like a man&#x27;s cologne..so I don&#x27;t use it a lot.. Maybe my daughter will use it..</li>
    <li> I have been using Redken Thickening Lotion 06 for about 4 months now and I really like it. My hair is short so I use very little and only on the longer hair on the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;The smell hasn&#x27;t bothered me and certainly I notice no odour 5 minutes after application.&lt;br /&gt;It does add body to very fine hair leaving the texture thicker, but I have not noticed any improvement in shine; in fact, my hair is a little more dull with it; but the extra body is so much appreciated that I am willing to let go of a little shine. I am no longer a flathead! I use a hair dryer, but previously without the product I would end up with a flat hairdo every time after drying it.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair. Recently moved to Florida. Very high humidity. Don&#x27;t like tons of hair spray. This gives me soft volume with minimal amount of spray to keep shape.</li>
    <li> I have a short pixie cut and VERY fine (and unfortunately thinning)  hair.  This works great, and even thickens my hair without blowdrying.  The only downside is that my hair seems a bit less shiny. But, like another reviewer, I&#x27;m willing to pay that price since I have literally tried almost everything on the market, and this is the only product that thickens my hair and keeps my hair from being all flyaway while still being able to run your hands through it. It also lasts a long time.  My last bottle lasted over 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of medium length fine hair. I use this product on the roots of my hair after shampooing while my hair is still wet. It gives my hair a lot of volume. I really love it!</li>
    <li> Purchased it based on other reviews here, and I will admit it does give more body to my hair. But I should have known, based on my experience with other Redken products, that it does not agree with my scalp. For whatever reason, this enflamed my scalp and gave me headaches, and I gave up using it after only two days. An effective product for what it does, but not for those with sensitive skin - whatever chemicals are in here just don&#x27;t agree with my body.</li>
    <li> My wife rellay enjoyed this product has used in the past and was glad was still available on AMAZON. The price was great and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Redken product for many years.  I have fine hair, but I have allot of hair.  This product gives my hair an extra boost and it still feels and looks natural, like there is no product in my hair.  The only problem with these web prices is that I can buy it from my local beauty supply for $15 for the 16.9 oz size.  Usually the web prices are good and I like it because they are delivered directly to my doorstep, but a $13 premium isn&#x27;t worth it.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and I like to keep it as long as possible.  A stylist I went to recommended this product to help make my hair look thicker when I style it in the mornings. It has made a WORLD OF DIFFERENCE!!!  I only use a little bit (maybe the size of the tip of my little finger) before I blow dry in the mornings and my hair looks much thicker.  The product is also very light weight.  My hair does not feel sticky or weighed down when I put this product in.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the results that this product offers me &amp; will continue to keep it as a staple. However~when I comb my wet hair (after washing) it has been getting a few of these nasty, tiny little snag knots. Wondering if the product could be washing down the hair~causing a build towards the end, resulting in these tiny lil&#x27; nasties? I have a ton of fine, colored hair~medium length. (And, yes I use Redken products &amp; rinse well, not encountering this prob til I began using this particular product)</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how much body this product adds to my baby fine hair.  And you only need to use a small amount.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this is a lifesaver.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years.  I apply it while my hair is damp (particularly in the crown area) and blow dry it for extra body and hold.  I also use Hairspray for hold but this is a great product.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! really does its job and this bottle is a great size to last for a while.</li>
    <li> I thought I was never going to have this product again until I saw it on Amazon.  Thank goodness I found it and now I have enough for many years because the size was 3 times the one I had.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it really helps build body in my very fine hair.  Works well with blow drying.  Only a little dab is necessary.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most excellent products I have ever used. I have very thin hair and this is the only product I have found that really, truly makes it look and feel thicker. Thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and was relieved to find it on Amazon as it is no longer available in stores or salons.  Just a tad adds volume without greasiness or stickiness.  I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and they don&#x27;t give my fine hair any extra volume or bounce.  They just do nothing or leave my hair feeling heavy.  Hope Redken doesn&#x27;t decide to discontinue it.</li>
