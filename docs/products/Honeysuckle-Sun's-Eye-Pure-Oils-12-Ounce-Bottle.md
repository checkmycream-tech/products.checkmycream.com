### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This was wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I was impressed with all of them but two.  </li>
      <li>But the honeysuckle was wonderful, and perfect for what I was making.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a tad softer than others I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s a very good choice for the size and price.</li>
      <li>Very good, and it does smell like honeysuckle oil.</li>
      <li>and she is THRILLED with this super-strong smelling oil!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>However it does smell nice...</li>
      <li>I bought it and it is so good that I will buy more.</li>
      <li>I have nothing innately against this group of people, in fact, for the most part I find their presence makes this town charming.</li>
      <li>I ordered honeysuckle oil from another vendor an amazon and thought theirs was nice.  </li>
      <li>its kind of hit and miss with some of these oils.</li>
      <li>I wanted something very light and airy.</li>
      <li>Fantastic oil!</li>
      <li>and I love them both.</li>
      <li>If you normally love honeysuckle, I think you&#x27;ll love this one.</li>
      <li>Honeysuckle is one of my favorite scents.  </li>
      <li>so I could smell it more when it is out.  </li>
      <li>putrid, wretched, I can think of more words to describe this, but I will stop at those.</li>
      <li>It is so ridiculously strong it is doesn&#x27;t even smell like honeysuckle and gives me a headache.</li>
      <li>but I found it to be too strong and \\&quot;deep\\&quot;?</li>
      <li>I was looking for more of a light, sweet, floral honeysuckle smell.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a light honeysuckle this probably isn&#x27;t it.</li>
      <li>Really strong and a bit overwhelmingly sweet</li>
      <li>it IS very powerful, so</li>
      <li>Excited to find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>True to the characteristics of the essence without being overly assertive.</li>
      <li>I used this full strength as a cologne.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad smell just not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
      <li>I like it so much that I ordered two more bottles as soon as I opened the first one!</li>
      <li>Quick service,high quality.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re new to honeysuckle, think of a lighter, perhaps even fruitier smell than jasmine, but still more flowery than anything else.</li>
      <li>Real honeysuckle was easy to detect and the Sun&#x27;s Eye Honeysuckle never fooled any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Its way too strong and the smell is very overpowering.  </li>
      <li>This oil smells exactly like fresh honeysuckle!</li>
      <li>The smell is nice and similar to honeysuckle</li>
      <li>Have had several compliments of smelling nice when wearing them.</li>
      <li>this smells exactly like I remember honeysuckle smelling like.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced!</li>
      <li>So this oil arrived, and to my dismay, it smelled exactly like a hippie store.</li>
      <li>Was very strong, as expected it did not smell like honeysuckle to me.</li>
      <li>but now I have to go find some real honysuckle scent....</li>
      <li>It has that &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; scent just like the real flowers and it lasts all day.</li>
      <li>WARNING: use very sparingly when using with a diffuser.</li>
      <li>It arrived to her house in a very timely manner</li>
      <li>Advertised as &amp;#34;1/2 ounce bottle of high quality Sun&#x27;s Eye Pure Oils™ brand</li>
      <li>This honeysuckle is so pretty smelling and soft.  </li>
      <li>I bought 3 different scents, Gardenia, honeysuckle &amp; Magnolia &amp; they all smell like cheap old lady soap.</li>
      <li>I have even brought in honeysuckle to the store when I worked there to do a direct comparison of scents between real honeysuckle and this oil.  </li>
      <li>This oil is extremely strong and gave my roommate and I headaches, I only used about 3 drops and mixed it with water....</li>
      <li>The Natural Foods store that I normally bought these from stopped stocking them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Their other scents (save one) are on target, but this one has nothing to do with true honeysuckle.</li>
      <li>so I can smell the honeysuckle and have tried to transplant vines to areas near my windows and doors</li>
      <li>It was so strong that I over-scented my product with just a few drops!  </li>
      <li>I used to work part time in a new age bookstore and they carried the Sun&#x27;s Eye essential oils.  </li>
      <li>I make sure I spend extra time out walking through my neighborhood in late May every year</li>
      <li>This particular brand did not wow me, but it is fragrant.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember the other that I didn&#x27;t like, but this one is a real issue.  </li>
      <li>You see, I live in a town that is very artsy, and attracts alot of free spirits in my circle, we call &#x27;em hippies, sometimes dirty hippies if they are obnoxious).</li>
      <li>In all seriousness, I agree with the other reviews here, this is a strong, somewhat \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; scent, and a little goes a long way.</li>

<li> should last a very long time.</li>
<li> Not surprised.</li>
<li> You only need a VERY little swipe of it for it to last all day.  </li>
<li> it was very deep and heavy.</li>
<li> This brand is no good as far as I&#x27;m concerned!</li>
<li> The oil is definitely honeysuckle and heavy so, a little (very little) goes a long way.</li>

<li> What a waste of my money.</li>
<li> Delicate and not overwhelming.</li>
<li> Hard to beat.</li>
<li> I learned the hard way.</li>
<li> But as my wife loves it, I feel it deserves at least four stars, maybe five.</li>
<li> I unfortuantely went overboard and put some behind my ears (pulse point), arms, knees and made myself sick by the end of the day.  </li>
<li> This had a very unpleasant and extremely powereful scent.  </li>
<li> I personally think this smells awful.</li>
<li> But I don&#x27;t like their weird smelling fragrances.</li>
<li> This one smells like torture &amp; hate.</li>
<li> Bought this for making bath salts, and I must say, I was very disappointed when it arrived.</li>
<li> The WORST part is they won&#x27;t let me return it (without paying for shipping)!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought this for making bath salts, and I must say, I was very disappointed when it arrived. You see, I live in a town that is very artsy, and attracts alot of free spirits in my circle, we call &#x27;em hippies, sometimes dirty hippies if they are obnoxious). They have shops around here (Silver City NM) and, each of these shops has a smell. I always thought it was patchouli, but I could be mistaken. At any rate, this smeel is not honeysuckle, and I don&#x27;t like it. I have nothing innately against this group of people, in fact, for the most part I find their presence makes this town charming. But I don&#x27;t like their weird smelling fragrances. So this oil arrived, and to my dismay, it smelled exactly like a hippie store. But, I made the salts, and my wife told me she loves the smell. Go figure. I suggested to my wife that she might take a shower sometime soon, and she just rattled a tambourine and told me that my \\&quot;negative vibes were muddying up the aura of her inner sanctum\\&quot; whatever that means. In all seriousness, I agree with the other reviews here, this is a strong, somewhat \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; scent, and a little goes a long way. I was expecting a lighter airier smell, and that is not what this is. But as my wife loves it, I feel it deserves at least four stars, maybe five. Nah, just four.</li>
    <li> I used this full strength as a cologne.  I do wish the scent lasted longer, but it probably lasts as long as regular cologne.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a light honeysuckle this probably isn&#x27;t it. The smell is nice and similar to honeysuckle but I found it to be too strong and \\&quot;deep\\&quot;? (I&#x27;m not familiar with the wording for perfumes) for my preference. Not a bad smell just not what I&#x27;m looking for. I wanted something very light and airy.</li>
    <li> This is not honey suckle, not only is it not that, it is putrid, wretched, I can think of more words to describe this, but I will stop at those. What a waste of my money. Do not trust reviews.</li>
    <li> The Natural Foods store that I normally bought these from stopped stocking them. Excited to find them on Amazon. Delicate and not overwhelming. Have had several compliments of smelling nice when wearing them.</li>
    <li> this smells exactly like I remember honeysuckle smelling like.  it IS very powerful, so a very tiny amount is enough.  should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> This oil smells exactly like fresh honeysuckle! It has that &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; scent just like the real flowers and it lasts all day. One word of warning, I spilled a couple of drops on my wood dresser and I did not realize I did until a day later and it totally took off the finish of the furniture! But that was just my fault and not a fault of the product!  I have both the carnation oil and the honeysuckle oil and I love them both.</li>
    <li> Really strong and a bit overwhelmingly sweet</li>
    <li> I bought it and it is so good that I will buy more. It shipped the same day. Three days and I got it.</li>
    <li> This was wonderful.  It was so strong that I over-scented my product with just a few drops!  But the honeysuckle was wonderful, and perfect for what I was making.  I look forward to using it in candles and lotions until the very last drop is gone.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this because of some of the reviews here.  The oil is definitely honeysuckle and heavy so, a little (very little) goes a long way.</li>
    <li> WARNING: use very sparingly when using with a diffuser. This oil is extremely strong and gave my roommate and I headaches, I only used about 3 drops and mixed it with water....the house smelled like musty flowers all day long...and the oil was only heated for about 20 to 30 minutes. I personally think this smells awful. Its way too strong and the smell is very overpowering.  Just be cautious when buying \\&quot;essential oils\\&quot;....its kind of hit and miss with some of these oils.</li>
    <li> I like it so much that I ordered two more bottles as soon as I opened the first one! Quick service,high quality. Hard to beat.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like honeysuckle.</li>
    <li> I used to work part time in a new age bookstore and they carried the Sun&#x27;s Eye essential oils.  I was impressed with all of them but two.  I can&#x27;t remember the other that I didn&#x27;t like, but this one is a real issue.  Honeysuckle is one of my favorite scents.  I make sure I spend extra time out walking through my neighborhood in late May every year so I can smell the honeysuckle and have tried to transplant vines to areas near my windows and doors so I could smell it more when it is out.  I have even brought in honeysuckle to the store when I worked there to do a direct comparison of scents between real honeysuckle and this oil.  I even had my friends who worked at the store close their eyes and compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was no contest.  Real honeysuckle was easy to detect and the Sun&#x27;s Eye Honeysuckle never fooled any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their other scents (save one) are on target, but this one has nothing to do with true honeysuckle.</li>
    <li> YUCK! YUCK! YUCK! This brand is no good as far as I&#x27;m concerned! And I buy A LOT of essential oils, so I&#x27;m no novice. I bought 3 different scents, Gardenia, honeysuckle &amp; Magnolia &amp; they all smell like cheap old lady soap. This one smells like torture &amp; hate. The WORST part is they won&#x27;t let me return it (without paying for shipping)! Not surprised. They&#x27;re probably trying to get rid of the stuff!</li>
    <li> Very good, and it does smell like honeysuckle oil. It&#x27;s a tad softer than others I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s a very good choice for the size and price. If you normally love honeysuckle, I think you&#x27;ll love this one. If you&#x27;re new to honeysuckle, think of a lighter, perhaps even fruitier smell than jasmine, but still more flowery than anything else.</li>
    <li> Was very strong, as expected it did not smell like honeysuckle to me. it was very deep and heavy. I was looking for more of a light, sweet, floral honeysuckle smell.</li>
    <li> This particular brand did not wow me, but it is fragrant. I&#x27;d buy it again, if the other brands were not available.</li>
    <li> IMO this is NOT even CLOSE to honeysuckle. However it does smell nice...just not what I wanted to buy. I am keeping it but now I have to go find some real honysuckle scent....sigh...</li>
    <li> This honeysuckle is so pretty smelling and soft.  I ordered honeysuckle oil from another vendor an amazon and thought theirs was nice.  This one blows them out of the water.  I unfortuantely went overboard and put some behind my ears (pulse point), arms, knees and made myself sick by the end of the day.  You only need a VERY little swipe of it for it to last all day.  Trust me.  I learned the hard way. I put some in some 100% African Shea Butter, melted the butter, poured it in a glass jar and viola!  Do yourself a favor and get this oil.  You&#x27;ll love it! Well, I do.</li>
    <li> Advertised as &amp;#34;1/2 ounce bottle of high quality Sun&#x27;s Eye Pure Oils™ brand oil&amp;#34;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a perfume type oil, that smells like a chemically type musty flower. It is so ridiculously strong it is doesn&#x27;t even smell like honeysuckle and gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> Fantastic oil! True to the characteristics of the essence without being overly assertive. Reasonably priced! Expedient delivery!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom who has been looking for honeysuckle oil for years.  It arrived to her house in a very timely manner and she is THRILLED with this super-strong smelling oil!</li>
    <li> This had a very unpleasant and extremely powereful scent.  It was just not the honeysuckle I was hoping it would be.</li>
