      <li>of fun giving baths with the Calendula CA Baby</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s the same smell as the shampoo</li>

      <li>Thanks CA Baby!</li>
      <li>I just went to a drugstore and found a extra sensitive Elmo bubble bath for $4, so I will try that out to see if it&#x27;s more economical.</li>
      <li>Makes great bubble bath and tough bubbles when you choose to use the (included) wand.  </li>
      <li>I like it but wouldn&#x27;t spend so much again.</li>
      <li>One capfull fills our whole tub with bubbles, and the wand is a prefect distraction for my toddler when she decides she&#x27;s not in the mood for a bath.</li>

      <li>I left off a star because the bubble wand doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>My one year old loves to splash about and watch/</li>
      <li>I like that they are natural and non-irritating and she likes that they make lots of bubbles.</li>
      <li>Smells lovely and love the ingredients but expensive for how few baths we got out of it.</li>

    <li> The kids love these bubbles! They are plentiful, smell great and don&#x27;t cause any skin reactions!</li>
    <li> I recently developed an adverse reaction to many of the perfume bubble baths.  California Baby bubble is the key for me and is so bubbly.  Great product and no ring around the bath tub.  Thanks CA Baby!</li>
    <li> What a pleasant surprise to have so many bubbles with non toxic ingredients! The bubbles are in my baby&#x27;s mouth and eyes in the tub without any problem-- no foul taste and zero burning. I tried it myself and it has zero taste and is very gentle. I love this brand!</li>
    <li> Great smell. Not to sweet or floral smelling. Good amount of bubbles</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and love the ingredients but expensive for how few baths we got out of it.</li>

    <li> My little grandson loves this stuff! It doesn&#x27;t burn his eyes either.</li>
    <li> My little girl loves these bubbles. They do not dry out her skin and the fragrance is subtle.  The bubbles last the duration of her bath.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really make very many bubbles in my opinion.  I do like the ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t appear to dry our baby&#x27;s skin out though.</li>
    <li> I bought for my 2 kids and they are having a lot of fun with it. You can make a lot of bubble without having to use too much product.</li>
    <li> good quality.Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These are great bathtime bubbles for my 2 year old.  I like that they are natural and non-irritating and she likes that they make lots of bubbles.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, so bubbly.  I don&#x27;t use the recommended on the bottle that would be SO bubbly.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.  Happy to have something natural and gentle for the kids</li>
    <li> Way too expensive for the size. Bubbles like any other bubbler. Smells nice. Was frozen when I received it so it leaked a little. I like it but wouldn&#x27;t spend so much again. ever.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, the brand is also very good.</li>
    <li> Smells great - bought this for the bubbles - very bubbly as advertised. It went quickly in our house - you may want to buy two if you use it a lot.</li>
    <li> I trust California baby.it&#x27;s a good brand for baby.Calendula plant is goog for skin. And it&#x27;s bubble very magical and funny</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!  Makes great bubble bath and tough bubbles when you choose to use the (included) wand.  And makes tons of bubbles with each blow!  Knowing that they are not toxic to my little one&#x27;s skin is just priceless.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!! One capfull fills our whole tub with bubbles, and the wand is a prefect distraction for my toddler when she decides she&#x27;s not in the mood for a bath.</li>
    <li> My children love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for my kids for years. I LOVE it.  It smells great and does relax my very energetic boys.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the title of this product is misleading, it doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s french lavender, it only says calendula, I thought it was fragrance free. I am not a fan of lavender but I have bern using it anyway for my toddler and no, it did not help him sleep better at all.&lt;br /&gt;I like the unscented one much better.</li>
    <li> I use of a lot of CA Baby products and love them but I will not be purchasing this bubble bath again. You have to pour a ton of it in the bath to even get some bubbles so I went through it very quickly. Smells good but that about the only positive thing I have to say.</li>
    <li> love it ,good for my baby</li>
    <li> California Baby... always a treat. Nice for chemically sensitive souls like me. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the bubbliest of bubble bath and soooo relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of fun giving baths with the Calendula CA Baby - try it you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
    <li> Finally I can wash their hair without fighting. I love the smell too. Apply the calendula cream after the bath.</li>
    <li> California baby is one of the few brands that doesn&#x27;t irritate my daughter&#x27;s very sensitive skin.  This baby bubble bath is the best! After one bath, I saw significant improvement in her eczema.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my 18 month old son, who loves bubbles.  Bathtime has now become a favorite activity!  We absolutely love this product. The smell is nice and relaxing, but not overpowering.  It leaves his skin feeling very soft. We will definitely be using this bubble bath regularly from now on.</li>
    <li> Very good shopping experience,bubble is too much.My baby just seven month,I think his will be like it after 1 years old.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great item. Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells good but I won&#x27;t purchase again because there are no bubbles!  What is a bubble bath with no bubbles?</li>
    <li> We love these bubble baths! Calendula has a rather strong fragrance for bubble-blowing but is pleasant for bubble baths. Very bubbly, esp great for bubble-blowing.</li>
    <li> This bubble bath smells natural and nice, and seems gentle. it is quite expensive though. I have bought two of these, and you can go through them very quickly if you do a bubble bath every day. I just went to a drugstore and found a extra sensitive Elmo bubble bath for $4, so I will try that out to see if it&#x27;s more economical.</li>
    <li> Best bubbles from a trusted source, yet.</li>
    <li> I left off a star because the bubble wand doesn&#x27;t really work. Although this product is simply amazing with or without a bubble wand.... My one year old loves to splash about and watch/eat  the bubbles in the tub.  California Baby never irritates my son&#x27;s sensitive skin and the scent is always pleasant. I love the convenience of Amazon Prime delivery and I feel great knowing that the products from California Baby are always safe.</li>
    <li> I pretty much summed it up in the summary line above.  We love the scent of the bubble bath and like California baby products but if you use 3-4 capfuls per bath, which is on the lower end of what they recommend, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> Good product for children，hope more competitive price later.</li>
    <li> Good products worthy of trust</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice because it&#x27;s the same smell as the shampoo and it&#x27;s gentle. The bubble wand will come in handy one day.</li>
    <li> I keep buying this stuff saying it&#x27;s for my infant and toddler, but it&#x27;s really my favorite bubble bath.  It smells like heaven.  It&#x27;s the best de-stressing bubble bath I&#x27;ve ever used.  Take your bubble bath to the next level.  Get this stuff.</li>
    <li> just use it,and i do not know how did it working,I think it will be ok!&lt;br /&gt;shi bu shi a !</li>
    <li> Suds are nice, product does not irritate baby&#x27;s sensitive skin. Do not need much product for a nice bubble bath.</li>
