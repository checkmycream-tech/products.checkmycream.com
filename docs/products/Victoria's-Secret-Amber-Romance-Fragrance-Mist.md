      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite scent</li>
      <li>this fragrance is my favorite</li>
      <li>The essense its very sweet to smell.</li>
      <li>but if you spray it on your clothing, it lasts a long time and has a very pleasant smell.  </li>
      <li>This is my go-to fragrance, not too strong, and very pretty and most importantly, doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze...</li>
      <li>great smell wish I could have gotten it back from her.</li>
      <li>therefore it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>it arrived earlier than it had said which was great.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance, very feminine but not too sweet!</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>fishermen and golfers clean the shelves....</li>
      <li>love was always enough).</li>
      <li>I came to Amazon and found a whole community of people who still had it in stock!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and came in at expected date</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, sweet, subtle and yet still spicy scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>I really like this body mist</li>
      <li>Since this is much cheaper I spray alittle Burberry and layer it with this.</li>
      <li>this body mist leaves a long lasting fresh scent, I love this product.</li>
      <li>I usually go for a fruity scent or a really bold, strong scent and this is neither.  </li>
      <li>Shipping time was decent as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every VS Garden Collection scent and this is my absolute least favorite.  </li>
      <li>I get more compliments when I wear this then my super expensive designer perfume.</li>
      <li>old</li>
      <li>and I am 69 yrs old.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t put it on my skin as we shouldn&#x27;t be putting chemicals directly on us</li>
      <li>This is very nice, a bit woodsy to me, however, I was disappointed that it was a large spray bottle of body spray, not toilet water or perfume.</li>
      <li>my stupid allergies keep me limited to this pretty much, so good thing I like it.</li>
      <li>It has such a strange smell and it is just too soft for me.  </li>

    <li> Jack, my soulmate for 41yrs. ordered 2 bottles of Amber Romance a about a month or so ago. A couple weeks ago the love of my life went to be with our Lord. He always tried to give me anything he thought would make me happy(his love was always enough). I really like this body mist and I like when people ask me what perfume are you wearing. To close this was the last gift I received from him. He was 73 yrs. old and I am 69 yrs old. So yes I am more than pleased with the product. Loretta</li>
