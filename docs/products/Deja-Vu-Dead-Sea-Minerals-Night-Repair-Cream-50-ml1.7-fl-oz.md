    <li> This is a product that you see in malls at a kiosk. I try to avoid them as much as possible and the sales people are always a little pushy. I don&#x27;t know how, but one of the girls actually got my attention and I reluctantly went over to the booth. I just had a manicure so I thought I was safe as all they ever want to do is put lotion on your hands. I am very glad I stopped. I made a joke that if she had a miracle product that would take the wrinkles away I would buy it. She tried putting it on my hand and I informed her that putting it on my hand wouldn&#x27;t tell me anything so she dabbed it on my unwilling husband before he knew what was happening. I literally could see the lines around his eyes soften within minutes. Makeup and all, I put a dab around my own and on my forehead. It is the most amazing product I have seen. I had a product once do the same thing, but it burned. This was very hydrating, softened all of the lines on my face. Mine are just fine lines now so I cannot attest to how it would do on deeper wrinkles, but hopefully with this product I won&#x27;t have to find out. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The cream was expired a year ago, it is very disappointed to spend money that will throw away without having to try first.</li>
    <li> So far, so good....I like to give a product a good month before I say...Great!  I have oily skin so even though my eye areas and sometimes neck areas are dry ...this product seems to be helping them maintain a soft and luxurious feel.....not bad,..</li>
    <li> This cream typically sells for about $80. at my local mall.  This is an unbelievable price (approx. $25.) and I was thrilled to find it.  And it arrived at my home the next day after I ordered it!  The cream is thick and cool and I can feel my face nicely tightening when I apply it.  I only use it once a week.  I really believe it helps your skin maintain a youthful glow.  I am nearly 60 and people are blown away when I tell them my age.  I always get compliments on my \\&quot;beautiful skin.\\&quot;  I have to be careful what I use on my face - it is so sensitive and I can get red blotches when I try something new.  But Deju Vu caused no side effects.  Hopefully more of this line will be sold on Amazon such as the facial peel.  I&#x27;ll certainly be looking!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream for my face.  I use it all the time and like it very much.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just awesome!  I use it with the Vita Gel Moisturizer for extra protection.  Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> The seller was great everything arrived promptly. And the boxes were wrappped in plastic :) . I love these products though they work great for my skin. My skin is looking brighter and clearer with each use. I would recommend both the seller and the products. I have sensitive skin and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and decided to give it a try. I am happy I did. It makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
    <li> I loved this night crème. My face felt so soft and any fine lines melted away. Love this product and will order again.</li>
    <li> really left my face creamy feeling.. and the lines around my mouth have gone down.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful night cream!  I use it every night and love the way it feels and it keeps my skin soft and well hydrated.</li>
    <li> my family loves this product, especially since for years we were not able to find a product that worked.  But why has the price gone up to drastically?  This will deter us from purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This Night Repair cream is ok, but not anything special in comparison to Olay, L&#x27;Oreal etc.  It has a light smell and it moisturizes.</li>
    <li> It soaks into the skin right away and it feels amazingly soft. It is not really expensive for how great it works.</li>
    <li> You only need a little and it still makes your skin hydrated, smooth and fresh looking. It also makes the skin feel &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; and youthful</li>
    <li> This line of skin care is great but ridiculously priced in the mall venue. My skin is clear and soft when I use this line. My frown lines go away when I pay amazon prices for it v. Mall price!</li>
    <li> This has always been one of my favorite products, and at this great, low price. No Brainer!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, would recommended</li>
    <li> Deja Vu Dead Sea Minerals Night Repair cream is lovely,soft,smooth,light and pure moisturizing magic! Get It, you will be thrilled you did!</li>
    <li> This item does ok was not what I thought when I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;For what it is its ok. There are other products that I have found with much better ingredients</li>
    <li> If you are wondering how on earth is this so much cheaper compared to the DeJa Vu cosmetics web page and what they are selling in the stores...I can assure you its not because it is expired. I just received this product in the mail and it doesn&#x27;t expire till 2016! Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t comment on how well the product works as I just started using it last night. I will follow up with an update, for those of you that have never used this product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Since I&#x27;ve been using these products my face has cleared up completely! I have battled break outs for years and have never been able to find anything that didn&#x27;t severely dried out my skin while still having break outs! This stuff is amazing! I use this night cream in conjunction with the eye gel, moisturizing gel (day time), facial lift mask, and the skin peeling.</li>
    <li> This is a super producted. If your looking for a cream to repair damaged skin, this is a must. I have use the deja vu producted and won&#x27;t use anything else. Try some today,  and see for yourself the results.</li>
    <li> I like this product never had used before but it is a worth product to try, it does i t job</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found Deja Vu products on Amazon.  It will keep me out of the malls.  I love it and my skin loves it.</li>
    <li> The night cream is great.</li>
