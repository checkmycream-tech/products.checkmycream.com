      <li>A check of current on-line prices indicate that Big Pony #1 is a decent fragrance considering the price/value - you can purchase a large bottle for under $50 USD - not too shabby..</li>
      <li>If you are a novice in the game, pass on BP#1 - there are plenty of citrus based fragrances out there with better performance.  </li>
      <li>After an hour Big Pony #1 sits close to the skin and is barely traceable after four hours of wear.  </li>

    <li> I love this perfume, it is not the one I prefer but, for the price this one is perfect, it last all the day,without being too strong, and my wife loves it. I buy from amazon, it is cheaper then the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it</li>

    <li> Mild but lovely. Like the scent.</li>
    <li> Yesterday I wore and wrote a review of Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Big Pony #4.  Next in my rotation is Big Pony #1 (blue bottle).  As noted yesterday, I am a true fan of all the Ralph Lauren fragrances - and I do like the Big Pony collection - I have many of RL&#x27;s signature scents and all of the Big Pony series.  In my opinion, Big Pony #1 is the best fragrance in this line.  It is a simple fragrance with notes of citrus/fruit and &amp;#34;woods&amp;#34;.  From the onset, the citrus takes center stage and any &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; notes are lost early on.  Not a bad thing, though.  The citrus blend is a very pleasant smell and all who like (myself included) citrus fragrances, will love this scent.  The issue or concern is the projection and longevity of the fragrance.  After an hour Big Pony #1 sits close to the skin and is barely traceable after four hours of wear.  I was greatly disappointed..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do admit, however, that I do like the bottle.  Great design and theme.  Given the citrus blend of notes, Big Pony #1 is best suited for daytime wear in Spring and Summer.  It offers great flexibility/versatility in those months as a safe office wear and that it can be worn to any event in excessive heat temperatures.  Should work well in the South Carolina heat and humidity - I can hardly wait..!! A check of current on-line prices indicate that Big Pony #1 is a decent fragrance considering the price/value - you can purchase a large bottle for under $50 USD - not too shabby..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Ralph Lauren&#x27;s Big Pony #1 is 4 stars out of 5 stars.  It smells great, but lacks the projection/sillage and longevity to be a major player.  For the serious collector, or Ralph Lauren fan, add to your collection.  If you are a novice in the game, pass on BP#1 - there are plenty of citrus based fragrances out there with better performance.  Find the right one for you (and your budget..).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count... Invest your time rather wasting your time...</li>
