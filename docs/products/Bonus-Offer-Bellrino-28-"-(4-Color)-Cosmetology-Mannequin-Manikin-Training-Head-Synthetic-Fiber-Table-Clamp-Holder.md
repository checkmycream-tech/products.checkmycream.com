    <li> This is a 5 star product and 5 star price</li>
    <li> The hair is lifelike on this mannequin head and facial features are some what life life with rubber skin. The head is smaller than what you would expect from an adult which is a little odd given it is a Cosmetology practice mannequin,</li>
    <li> I got the head to practice braiding but the hair sheds a lot and the hair is put in a crazy direction which makes styling it a little difficult. Otherwise its ok</li>
    <li> Was given as a gift, but she really liked it.</li>
    <li> The hair feels so natural. I want to teach people how to braid. The only difficulty for that is, it&#x27;s cut in a blunt V. For braiding, a straight cut would have been better, but it&#x27;s still great to have.</li>
    <li> It came in a box but her hair wasent that long when I got it I checked before anything done</li>

    <li> great Christmas gift for curious teens to experienment with</li>
    <li> Ive experienced A LOT of shedding! So if purchasing this product..expect that. It also has alopecia as well, which makes it hard to style certain ways</li>
    <li> I bought this item to practice braids and updos (I only received this item 3 days ago) and the hair falls out INSTANTLY. The head is already bald in places! I do NOT recommend spending money on this head!</li>
    <li> I just wish it was real hair,  When you buy this type of Mannequin with synthetic hair, it falls out and hard to style</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this mannequin</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter received one of these for Christmas. She loves it! She sits for hours and practices braids on the mannequin&#x27;s hair. This product was on time and packaged well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Cosmo student n this work great for updos &amp; braiding. It&#x27;s by far tha best synthetic hair I&#x27;ve felt. It&#x27;s a must for any cosmetology student who need operations done rapidly!</li>

    <li> great product very pleased fast shipping no complaints at all</li>
    <li> My niece has very long, wavy, natural hair.  I bought this one for her so she can practice ways to style her hair when it is flat-ironed.  She was so happy to receive this for Christmas.  She loves it.  I think it is great.  The hair is long and silky.  She has twisted it, braided it, and put it in buns and ponytails.  She asked what would happen if she washed it and I told her I didn&#x27;t know.  I will update review after she washes it and let you all know.</li>
    <li> Good ítems hope to deal with you in the future</li>
