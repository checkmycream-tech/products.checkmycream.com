      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So refreshing, but I can&#x27;t use it solely.</li>
      <li>It needs to be better secured because of the pump.</li>
      <li>All 3 of my daughters love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I finally found the perfect shampoo for me!  </li>
      <li>Only the best for my curls and coils!</li>
      <li>Love this product for my hair.</li>
      <li>Excellent for daily use.</li>
      <li>While it did address the dryness of my hair, I still required a conditioner to be able to comb through it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a medicinal fragrance.</li>
      <li>your hair will be clean and nice smelling.</li>
      <li>It smells great, allowing me to cover the medicine smell of this particular shampoo, while helping detangle for an easier brushing.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is ok, not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Your hair will feel clean!  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, smells great, and clean very well.  </li>

      <li>Hair is soft, smooth, smells great.</li>
      <li>My hair is on the fine side, shoulder length, and salon processed about every two months.</li>
      <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
      <li>Very Pleased with this shampoo, it is just wonderful, I have fine hair and thought maybe it would be to heavy but not at all, in fact my hair looks and feels much thicker and seem to grow faster.</li>
      <li>Leaves my curly frizzy hair smooth and without build up from the conditioner over time.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is OK, but made me break out right away.  </li>
      <li>Great product that functions almost as well as the Aveda products I used to be able to afford, and for much less money.</li>
      <li>I finally found a safe shampoo and conditioner that I LOVE!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve struggled with finding a co-wash / shampoo that leaves my hair clean yet NOT stripped.</li>
      <li>This product is great for super dry hair.  </li>
      <li>I love the way my hair feels and is very manageable</li>
      <li>But, Giovanni&#x27;s Avocado &amp; Olive Oil Shampoo makes my hair smooth (yet full &amp; voluminous), shiny, healthy-looking, vibrant, &amp; clean!</li>
      <li>Seriously the best shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>Shipped relatively quickly</li>
      <li>love this shampoo, leaves hair soft and is cruelty free</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, and most shampoos cause me to get contact dermatitis.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve had the smaller containers before and it made my hair soft and light and smelled really good...</li>
      <li>I tried it anyway and sure enough, my hair feels like it is clean and moist.</li>
      <li>I was honest and told Amazon that not much was lost, but they gave me a full refund anyway and let me keep the product.</li>
      <li>The shampoo/conditioner makes my hair very soft and easy to manager.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product I brought where my hair is very clean and soft.</li>
      <li>But the minute I washed it with the Giovanni&#x27;s Avocado &amp; Olive Oil Shampoo, it was smooth, soft, shiny, &amp; voluminous once again!</li>
      <li>This is a great product for Natural Hair and all other hair types.</li>
      <li>Definitely found my new favorite!</li>
      <li>First olive oil shampoo I have found that does what it promises.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give it more stars is I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent.</li>
      <li>so it really makes it worth the money.</li>
      <li>I never feel like my hair is clean, in fact I feel like my hair is more weighed down and dirtier than before I was it</li>
      <li>Good price, good product, bad packing.</li>
      <li>Not bad for moisturizing natural hair</li>
      <li>For this shampoo to be this great with hard water!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and transitioning to natural hair.  </li>
      <li>I have blonde, long, fine hair and have to watch what shampoos I buy because many end up leaving my hair greasy.</li>
      <li>and  I am very particular about the shampoos that I use on my hair.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s really the only accurate way  to describe it.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t have to you as much of this product as you do Wen</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely miraculous.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The best shampoo for 3b curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;I am in live with this shampoo and conditioner! It is the perfect amount of moisture and leaves my hair shinny!</li>
    <li> Love this product for my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair!  I have naturally wavy hair, and when paired with this shampoo it has changed my life.  I used to have to straighten my hair for it to be presentable and manageable.  However, it still looked horrible most of the time.  With this shampoo I no longer need to straighten my hair!  In fact my hair has never been softer and more gorgeous.  It has also grown to it&#x27;s longest length ever since it no longer breaks, and I SWEAR new growth is coming in.  I&#x27;m never using anything else.  I finally found the perfect shampoo for me!  Also on a side note I have hard water.  For this shampoo to be this great with hard water!  I mean come on...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and transitioning to natural hair.  I love the way my hair feels and is very manageable</li>
    <li> It makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo which cleanses nicely without drying out your hair. I have dry, colored hair and  I am very particular about the shampoos that I use on my hair. This is one that you only need a little bit and it does the job, clean without drying. My husband even likes this shampoo</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend and it makes her hair look beautiful.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really deeply moisturize or cleanse</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s gentle. Has a GREAT smell. So refreshing, but I can&#x27;t use it solely. It&#x27;s too gentle since I have hair grease, moisturizer, etc. that builds up alongside an active lifestyle. It&#x27;s too gentle to use it weekly, but I alternate it with my clarifying shampoo and it works WONDERS. It&#x27;s a great buy.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a HUGE bottle and it may be expensive, but a little goes a LONG way.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is down right terrible. I love most Giovanni products, but this is below quality for then. It leaves a extra residue on your hair that makes it totally unmanagible.</li>
    <li> I got this for my granddaughter and she really loves it.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo because I have really sensitive skin and they discontinued my usual olive oil shampoo.  This shampoo is OK, but made me break out right away.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for someone with sensitive skin or someone who need hypoallergenic stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product! leaves my hair nice , and soft.i recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying many different brands of shampoo &amp; conditioner the past couple of years since my old favorite was discontinued.  I LOVE the way it makes my hair feel.  Very soft, not weighed down.  The fragrance is ok, not too strong.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! My hair is looking healthier and shinier since I started using it several months ago.</li>
    <li> Not bad for moisturizing natural hair it&#x27;s seems to do what it says.  This is the first product I brought where my hair is very clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Great product! Shipped relatively quickly but the shampoo was leaking when I recieved it... It needs to be better secured because of the pump.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo! Smells great and feels invigorating!</li>
    <li> I usually have combination hair. I didn&#x27;t realize this hair care product was for dry hair until after I bought it. I tried it anyway and sure enough, my hair feels like it is clean and moist. It isn&#x27;t overly moist and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has a bunch of chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/7/2015&lt;br /&gt;It has been about 18 months now and I have not used the Giovanni as of late.  I decided to use up some older shampoo&#x27;s.  BOY WAS THAT A MISTAKE!  I miss this shampoo so badly that I am going to go back to it very soon!  It keeps your hair moist!  You will have less flyaways!  Your hair will feel clean!  If I had to have shampoo on an island, it wouldn&#x27;t be any of the other Giovanni 2chic ones, just the Avocado and Olive Oil product.  I like the volume version and the coconut one, but they still aren&#x27;t as good as this one!  :-)</li>
    <li> One of two bottles came with a broken spout and got all over the rest of my purchases. Good price, good product, bad packing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several months, along with the matching conditioner. We&#x27;ve also recently started using it to wash our daughter&#x27;s hair (3.5 years old). It&#x27;s great. Hair is soft, smooth, smells great. Not sure what more I could expect from a shampoo + conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product that functions almost as well as the Aveda products I used to be able to afford, and for much less money. Leaves my curly frizzy hair smooth and without build up from the conditioner over time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for Natural Hair and all other hair types. The best among the rest of products that I have ever used</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  My hair was breaking off something terrible.  This made a tremendous difference in just a few days.  I&#x27;m sticking with this for a long time.  I&#x27;m a senior citizen and my hair is already thin but now I feel I have a chance to save some of it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Found this to be a really excellent shampoo.  I color my hair and this shampoo and conditioner help keep my hair moisturized. Keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is drying to curly hair and isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all. It cleans your scalp well hence the 3 star. The suds dried my hair not the soap cause I know focus on my scalp so you know if you have dry hair it&#x27;s a no-no.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this shampoo from walmart before and it was really awesome...this shampoo is rather lacking in the wow factor. I never feel like my hair is clean, in fact I feel like my hair is more weighed down and dirtier than before I was it, I&#x27;m not sure if it is the bottle, or if I just got a bad batch but I&#x27;ve had the smaller containers before and it made my hair soft and light and smelled really good...I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong with this product but I can&#x27;t wait until I&#x27;ve used it all so I can look for something else</li>
    <li> The package arrived with a broken lid and the shampoo was spilled all over.</li>
    <li> I like this product . It&#x27;s a good natural shampoo without sulfate at a comparatively cheaper price than other organic shampoos that do just about the same job . It doesn&#x27;t make my hair like straw . And moisturizes  it well . But the next day my hair is greasy and feels weighed down so I shampoo everyday . I&#x27;m still searching for that &amp;#34;the one &amp;#34; shampoo that will take my breath away but till then I love this and will continue using it</li>
    <li> Seriously the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Period.</li>
    <li> This product is great for super dry hair.  It&#x27;s not greasy or too thick to apply and does not leave any residue in the shower.  It&#x27;s the perfect weight for daily use.  The smell is fairly light, neutral, and pleasant.  Works well with the avocado and olive oil conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is the first shampoo that I have used since I have been natural for a year and it made my hair so saoft, that I don&#x27;t even have to condition it</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel dry</li>
    <li> love this shampoo, leaves hair soft and is cruelty free</li>
    <li> I have great hair.  This helps a lot. Plus its organic.  Yay.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and the size of the bottle.  It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than at our local Wal-Mart.  The shampoo/conditioner makes my hair very soft and easy to manager.  I have very long, straight hair.  Before switching to this product I used Wen Hair care products and I like this brand better.  Giovanni shampoo/conditioner is very similar to Wen as far as how it makes my hair feel and look after the wash and you don&#x27;t have to you as much of this product as you do Wen so it really makes it worth the money.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel so soft and has helped with my split ends and fly-aways. I have blonde, long, fine hair and have to watch what shampoos I buy because many end up leaving my hair greasy. This shampoo does not! Definitely found my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Very Pleased with this shampoo, it is just wonderful, I have fine hair and thought maybe it would be to heavy but not at all, in fact my hair looks and feels much thicker and seem to grow faster. I just love the shampoo and conditioner. The service is great too. Thank You</li>
    <li> Best conditioner Ever</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, no more tangles, very light pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great at providing the moisture I needed. It&#x27;s listed for dry, damaged hair. While it did address the dryness of my hair, I still required a conditioner to be able to comb through it. My hair is on the fine side, shoulder length, and salon processed about every two months. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it more stars is I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent. It&#x27;s more of a medicinal fragrance. I recently picked up Giovanni&#x27;s conditioner to go with this shampoo. It&#x27;s the Ultra-Volume for fine, limp hair in the tangerine &amp; papaya butter. It smells great, allowing me to cover the medicine smell of this particular shampoo, while helping detangle for an easier brushing. Though I like their products, I will probably not purchase this particular product of Giovanni&#x27;s line again.</li>
    <li> First olive oil shampoo I have found that does what it promises. Excellent for daily use.</li>
    <li> I use this with the 2Chic Avocado &amp; Olive Oil Hair Mask. My hair is soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It adds moisture to my spiral curly hair without weighing it down. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I have 4A+B hair and I&#x27;ve struggled with finding a co-wash / shampoo that leaves my hair clean yet NOT stripped. I HATE that squeaky clean feeling. This is the one folks. THIS IS THE ONE. I tried this a while ago when I was first went natural and started getting into higher end products. Only the best for my curls and coils! Once the bottle was done, I thought to try others products by other bands (so tempting isn&#x27;t it???) and nothing compared to this. So about 5-6 different products later, I came running back to this shampoo with open arms. A little goes a long way and you will have this bottle for a while. This is the BEST shampoo experience I have ever had. In addition, I have to say that Giovanni has continued to impress me with their hair products.My hair NEVER feels dry which is a big concern for me with natural hair. My hair is thick and it has a nice curl pattern, but the thing that I struggle with a lot is dryness. I hate when my hair looks dry and I hate it feeling dry. Giovanni products help me get past that. Kudos!!</li>
    <li> and smells nice. your hair will be clean and nice smelling. After you wash it with 2chic Avocado &amp; Olive Oil Shampoo.</li>
    <li> Like product but took way to long to get here!</li>
    <li> Happy hair and such a nice smell!</li>
    <li> I finally found a safe shampoo and conditioner that I LOVE!</li>
    <li> Giovanni&#x27;s Avocado &amp; Olive Oil Shampoo is a miracle hair care product beyond compare! I have thick hair, but the texture of it is fine &amp; wavy. It is also very layered &amp; has multiple blond color processes done on it (straight bleach, highlights, lowlights, &amp; tints). I also use a lot of heat. A lot of shampoos--including those for color-treated or over-processed hair--will still leave my hair looking dry, frazzled, &amp; with ends sticking out everywhere. Other conditioning shampoos will weigh my hair down &amp; make it look &amp; feel coated, greasy, &amp; dirty. Ugh. But, Giovanni&#x27;s Avocado &amp; Olive Oil Shampoo makes my hair smooth (yet full &amp; voluminous), shiny, healthy-looking, vibrant, &amp; clean! While I was waiting for my purchase to arrive (which came within a few days!), I used a different shampoo that was supposedly ultra conditioning &amp; for dry, color-treated hair, but it made my hair look like frizzy straw. It was awful. I thought my hair was ruined beyond repair.  But the minute I washed it with the Giovanni&#x27;s Avocado &amp; Olive Oil Shampoo, it was smooth, soft, shiny, &amp; voluminous once again! I was so ecstatic. This product is absolutely miraculous. That&#x27;s really the only accurate way  to describe it. And it seems to work well on all different hair types as well, because my daughter has very thick, healthy, straight, (dyed) black hair with crimson bangs. Completely different hair from mine &amp; she loves this product as well. I also like that this shampoo is essentially scent-free as opposed to the chemical smell or heavily-perfumed scents of most other hair-care products I&#x27;ve tried. In fact, I love everything about this shampoo. You can actually find this shampoo @ Target, but it only comes in a small squeeze tube, which I find inconvenient to use in the shower. I also find it rather difficult to get the shampoo out once you&#x27;re about 3/4 of the way through the tube. But this economy size available through Amazon with the salon pump makes a great product even better &amp; easier to use. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> suffer from a lot of allergies to include lotions and cleansers. I live in North Pole AK which is very always very dry - especially in the winter with the wood burner going.  As you can imagine it royally dries our your hair. This shampoo and conditioner has been a LIFE SAVER! My hair is baby fine and it has been soft, lots of lift, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.... and it smells really good. I definitely recommend to people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, and most shampoos cause me to get contact dermatitis. Isn&#x27;t that rough? I didn&#x27;t want to start using Vanicream Lite for shampoo (uchk, then my hair would get all grimy and greasy), so I thought about getting a natural, paraben-free shampoo with few ingredients. Giovanni is absolutely what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the shampoo, part of it was leaking. I was honest and told Amazon that not much was lost, but they gave me a full refund anyway and let me keep the product. I think that this was just a packing error and not the fault of Giovanni. I love this shampoo and am a life user.</li>
    <li> Great service! great product! My hair loves this product too</li>
    <li> This super concentrated shampoo is great!  Doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, smells great, and clean very well.  All 3 of my daughters love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product previously and it worked well with my 4b African American natural hair. Smells really good and it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
