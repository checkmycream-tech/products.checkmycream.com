<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product!  I like it because it was as nice as shown in the picture.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, but I&#x27;d rather it had little &amp;#34;grippies&amp;#34; on the inside.  Other than that, I am enjoying this head band.</li>
    <li> Very strong, the base head band is metal.</li>
    <li> Super cool accessory. There isn&#x27;t anything like this in the U.S. I not only wear it as a headband but as a choker and it rocks!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 6 yr old daughter&#x27;s Ever After High costume. She was Raven. It&#x27;s more comfortable than a lot of her other more expensive headbands.</li>
    <li> It is put together with hot glue. Fell apart after the first wear.</li>
    <li> Super cute. Even better in person, doesn&#x27;t look cheap. Awesome price. Definitely a great deal.</li>
    <li> The cutest headband ever!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love it but had to glue it back together after wearing it a few times</li>
    <li> Comfy and cute :D none of the spikes have broken off so that&#x27;s always a good sign.</li>
    <li> Looks super cute, but the bottom portion did fit a bit tight behind my ears, causing me to get a sort of ache back there.  I have to adjust it every hour or so to a different position so it doesn&#x27;t hurt too much.  I might end up gluing some felt or something on the inside of the bottom parts so I don&#x27;t have to be in pain to wear it.</li>
    <li> Really great and cute! The spikes are noticeable but not too crazy, they are pretty sharp though!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. It&#x27;s stylish and really well made.</li>
    <li> Came on time, cute, and very appealing. The leather band has a nice light gloss. The spikes a lil Sharp for my liking but can be overlooked, and the inside has a metal band instead of something else. So it is pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> It would&#x27;ve rated it with a 5. I gave it a 4 because part of the faux leather was loose near one end. Other than that, I am glad the inner band is made of sturdy metal material, because if it was plastic, I am fairly certain it would have snapped during shipping or prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am so pleased with my purchase. I&#x27;m far from a daring person when it comes to fashion. I never would have thought this could look good on me or that I could pass this look.  As soon as I put the headband on, I couldn&#x27;t help smiling at how cute this headband is! So be daring, and give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I have dark brown hair, and thought this item in black would be the best color choice in order to play down the punk look, but emphasize the headband with a tailored look (try: plenty of volume in a high ponytail).</li>
    <li> Super cute and on trend, arrived as shown. Shipping took almost two months though</li>
    <li> I love this! But sadly it broke after a few months of wear. Glue came apart.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cute but it is kind of bent so when you put it on your head, it doesn&#x27;t sit where it needs to; still trying to fix it.</li>
    <li> I love this! It looks great on my short hair and it&#x27;s very comfy to wear all day as to where most headbands would start hurting after a while. It&#x27;s very adorable and people have commented on it and asked where I got this! I would recommend this to a friend and plus it&#x27;s easy on your money! Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this headband! Now, if only it could stay together.&lt;br /&gt;The headband shipped within a reasonable time (Two or three weeks, if I remember correctly), and I was overjoyed. It&#x27;s a bit wider than I expected, and the spikes are smaller, but I don&#x27;t mind one bit. It&#x27;s really cute. When I got it, I started wearing it every day. The style looks awesome with everything in my wardrobe— lace, floral, graphic prints, sweaters, dresses, and tank tops. I even wore it to a formal banquet and got many compliments! It can either increase the edginess of a goth or punk outfit or make a sweet, frilly outfit seem less Lolita-esque. When wearing it, the skin behind my ears would get a little irritated, but I have sensitive skin and this happens with any headband.&lt;br /&gt;After about three weeks of wear, however, the leather strip started peeling off of the metal band, and now it&#x27;s almost completely detached. I can&#x27;t wear it anymore, but all I have to do to fix it is hot-glue it back down. Should be an easy fix. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Super cute, seems sturdy. However the packaging it came in was essentially the material of a bag like you&#x27;d get at a supermarket, no padding whatsoever so I&#x27;m shocked it wasn&#x27;t damaged. A few of the rivets were tarnished but hey, what do you expect for $3 from China. Still looks just like I&#x27;d expected c:</li>
    <li> I was actually very impressed at the product considering its price. The backbone is actually a very sturdy metal and the spikes are cute (but not super sharp) It has some really nice comfortable tips so it doesn&#x27;t dig into your head and give you a nasty headache. Also, it looks like it&#x27;s covered in real leather (actually pleather) and is very adorable ^.^ I will definitely wear this more a lot.</li>
    <li> Its adorable, and super sharp! Its awesome. Its a bit delicate feeling so just be gentle with it :)</li>
    <li> I love this!&lt;br /&gt;The inside is a stiff metal, and it&#x27;s a bit tight on the head, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s new and I&#x27;m terrified of breaking it!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I can see some hot glue sticking out, but easily fixed by pulling it off. The bottom is covered in black fabric, so it&#x27;s not painful to wear either.&lt;br /&gt;The studs are cute, and very alternative looking. I get tons of compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, nor from the photo, but this product really is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;My package was supposed to arrive the 23rd, but was here on the 17th, early packages are always acceptable in my world.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> super happy about this purchase &#x3D;D it is very well made and it&#x27;s made out of good quality &#x3D;D !!!</li>
    <li> slides off my oval head easy, its too circular. But I still think its shweet.</li>
    <li> Really really really love the headband! It&#x27;s a muuuuuch better material and style than I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> It took a while to get here but is great quality, super cute, and completely worth it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this headband. I just got it in the mail today and wore it out. It&#x27;s cheap, but good and doesn&#x27;t give off that &amp;#34;totally cheap&amp;#34; look. Nothing was broken or loose and it fit my head perfectly.</li>
    <li> Perfect but watch the tips, and sometimes can give a headache do to how right it is but I can manage</li>
    <li> This headband has been a wardrobe staple for me. I have worn it so much the fabric began to seperate from the metal but a little bit of glue fixed that. I have received tons of compliments on it as well. It is good quality and doesn&#x27;t look cheap!</li>
    <li> This is a really cute headband, for my daughter anyway. I cannot comment on durability since we have only had it a couple of weeks. But even if it snapped in half tomorrow, it would have been worth the $3 we spent on it. Be advised that most, if not all, sellers are overseas so allow extra time for delivery.</li>
    <li> looks like the picture fits fine but kinda gives me a head ache if i wear it in one spot to long</li>
    <li> so cute that my mom stole it for herself</li>
    <li> If I could wear this anywhere I could. I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a while, but every time I&#x27;ve seen something similar, it&#x27;s been listed as, like, twenty dollars. Item was precisely as described and fits like a dream.</li>
    <li> Very cute for the money and fits my big head!</li>
    <li> Super cute but pinches my head</li>
    <li> It is just what you see</li>
    <li> The spikes are cute and small, smaller than expected. It&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
    <li> For as cheap as it is, it&#x27;s a nice headband. I&#x27;ve worn it many times and it&#x27;s still in good condition.</li>
    <li> Amazing strong packaging, studs are secure and it&#x27;s a great fit, even with my extensions on c: shipping took a while but overall, nice product</li>
    <li> it was a good headband except it make my head start to ache really fast and the spikes screw off pretty easily, but other than that it looks great and is fine.</li>
    <li> I like this headband a lot, but sadly, the faux leather studded strip started to separate from the metal headband base. Pretty badly. I&#x27;ll have to glue the headband back together, but hey, I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I purchase this because I was inspired by a movie I love Bedazzled. The girl devil wore it in the movie and I found one close to it,  I thought it was cool and every now n then my friends asked where did I buy that I told them Amazon</li>
    <li> it goes well along with my brand new shoes and i love it.</li>
    <li> Very cute! I really love it and wear it quite frequently, though.. I do have to take it off for periods of time due to it squeezing my head a bit, giving me bad headaches.. but I&#x27;m generally prone to frequent migraines, so that could also just be me.</li>
    <li> i love this, is beautifull</li>
    <li> Cute, but the headband hurts the back of my ears after wearing it for a very small amount of time; I can deal with it though!</li>
    <li> This awesome little headband arrived in a very safe Styrofoam box to protect it during shipping. i&#x27;m happy with the quality of it and i think it looks totally cute on me. Seems like pretty decent quality materials for the price. i hope it holds up for a good long time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute, but doesn&#x27;t feel very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. It looks awesome and can be worn with any outfit to give it a little punk look.</li>
    <li> First, it arrived way earlier than expected&lt;br /&gt;it looks just like the picture. Its durable and a perfect girl for a friend son or daughter&lt;br /&gt;It is so worth its price I reccomend</li>
    <li> Really cute, looks just like the picture. A bit uncomfortable behind the ears, but no more so than every headband. Higher quality than expected</li>
    <li> Its so cute and it was so cheap but it doesn&#x27;t look it! I havent had any issues with it. It looks like leather and I would definitely but from them again!</li>
    <li> Pretty rad and worth your money</li>
    <li> I rated this product a 3 because I do like the way that it looks and it fits comfortably, but it is defiantly not worth how much it&#x27;s priced at. You can see where the glue had been seeping out of the metal part that divides it from the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; part. It&#x27;s defiantly cheaply made so if you order this, I&#x27;d recommend that you take care of it and be gentle with it, as it does not look like it will last very long.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy! This headband has some weight to it, which I love. I have super think hair so this is great. There are no comb teeth on it to keep it in place though.</li>
    <li> I love it. I got it two months ago and its still in good condition. The points do unscrew but they go right back on.</li>
    <li> Very awesome hair band. Fits my 4 year old a hair too big but she will grow into it!</li>
    <li> Cute but small, makes your head hurt if you wear for long amounts of time</li>
    <li> The spikey thingys keep on falling out and you cant put it back on. I don&#x27;t reccomend this item at all. Dont buy it!</li>
