      <li>Very strong and gets very hot, but not too hot!</li>

      <li>The nozzles seem kinda cheap.</li>
      <li>These nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when I try to rotate them.</li>
      <li>Lightweight was important feature.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really a fantastic blow drier for professionals and at home use.</li>

      <li>For the life of me, I can&#x27;t get smooth ends with a hair dryer.</li>
      <li>With good technique can leave hair silky soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ultimately, if you&#x27;re looking for more power and good enough heat this would be for you.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very powerful however.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited to write my review for this one.</li>

      <li>I love my new Rusk!</li>
      <li>This does get hot!</li>
      <li>have very curly, fine hair, and a lot of it, prone to frizz.</li>
      <li>Very good power as I expected since it is a professional product .</li>
      <li>And, it was so powerful</li>
      <li>powerful air flow made me try the diffuser which did nothing for drying my hair.</li>
      <li>In fact it&#x27;s so powerful</li>
      <li>It id definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>it did it super fast!</li>
      <li>so if you have wavy or curly hair and you want to straighten it without using a flat iron, this blow dryer will straighten it nicely with no frizz.</li>
      <li>Not to mention everytime I&#x27;d try to spin it it would end up falling right off.</li>
      <li>I am a stylist and having the right dryer makes all the difference.</li>
      <li>While I loved my Babyliss, I did wish it had had the diffuser attachment for curls, so that was definitely something I was looking for in a new dryer.</li>
      <li>This works super fast</li>
      <li>Amazon had it listed at a very close price, so I gifted it to myself  for (early)</li>
      <li>THIS NICE DRY</li>

    <li> This is a great dryer the one star rating is a reflection on Amazon&#x27;s listing only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The listing for this item stated that it was available for shipping to Australia.&lt;br /&gt;Hence, you would assume that it would work with Australian mains power - WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere in the listing (including specifications) did it warn that this dryer could only be used with 110 volts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia uses 240 volts, so the dryer is useless - I was going to return it but the return postage was $60.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon  |: (</li>
    <li> Love it! Excellent product. Very good power as I expected since it is a professional product . I hope lasts forever as if used in a salon</li>
    <li> Pretty good Dryer. My only wish is that it blew a bit hotter on the max heat setting. It&#x27;s very powerful however.</li>
    <li> This is the best blowdryer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> THE BOMB!!!!!!!!! I have thick hair and at 41 yrs old been looking, for years, for a blow dryer that BLOWS ALOT OF AIR. BINGO, Found it!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer!!!</li>
    <li> This baby has power!  I have very thick hair......and a lot of it........this cut my blow drying time down significantly!!  It is a little loud but is totally worth it.  The only problem I had was it set off my smoke detector when I was using a round brush with it.</li>
    <li> It is too heavy for me.  I gave it to my neice and ordered a T3 featherweight because it is lighter</li>
    <li> Opened a Beauty Salon in Costa Rica, this is the best Hair Dryer we ever had... very easy and reliable product!</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist I love this dryer. It&#x27;s light weight but powerful and gets the job done quickly. I&#x27;ve used everything from elchim to babyliss and by far the Rusk 7500 is what I&#x27;d prefer over the elchim anyday.</li>
    <li> the first one i got was broken, but they replaced it with no issues. the nozzles don&#x27;t fit well, though, which is annoying. you have to jam them on or just forsake them. that&#x27;s the only thing keeping this from 5stars, it works really well. 3 heat settings, 3 speed settings, and a cool button for extra cold. it&#x27;s really a fantastic blow drier for professionals and at home use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time purchasing an item from Amazon. It was a very easy process and the dryer arrived on time. The hair dryer exceeded all my expectation!I have very curly hair and I was able to blow dry it in less than 30 minutes. The hair dryer is light and of great quality. I have purchased lots of hair dryers and this one tops them all. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I love my new Rusk! It is a little heavier than I thought it would be, but it is easy to hold. The 4 attachments make any style possible.</li>
    <li> If I knew this Hair Dryer was this good. (more than just good), I wouldn&#x27;t spend to buy many Hair Dryers in the past. This one is very quiet and powerful. The dryer is still cool after use it. Buy one. You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 1.5 years in the salon i like the dryer, actually gets too hot so i rarely use it on high heat, the cold button is placed in a good spot, dryer tends to be a little heavy when using all the time. but it hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble, over all it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> love it the best product!</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever!  VERY powerful!</li>
    <li> Needed a more powerful dryer for less drying time for myself and my full-coated Havanese as we have very thick, dry hair. This Rusk worked GREAT! Lot&#x27;s of different settings to choose from and the motor noise is not irritating.&lt;br /&gt;VERY pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> It is heavier than I want.</li>
    <li> EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;Turned my hair into straw&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: good blow, not too hot&lt;br /&gt;Cons:heavy and the way the attachments attach is bad (you really have to push super hard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best under $100 hairdryer I have ever used. I had a 20% of coupon at that big bed and bath store. It was 99.99 so I got a good deal. It is a solid hair dryer and solid made. Made in Italy. Good blow and not too hot means hair dries faster with less damage. With good technique can leave hair silky soft. Not as defrizzing as my Volare though. And it feels heavier to me. So my Volare will remain my baby. It is better than the Elchim 2001, the $300 T3,  $200 CHI and an FHI dryer that I tried. I have super long wavy hair, live in the Bay Area, and I don&#x27;t get haircuts often enough, so I need the anti-frizz. Also I am not great at blowdrying hair so I need the idiot proof anti-frizzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not as good as my Volare V2 by Babyliss with the Ferrari AC motor (paid $70 more for). That dryer is magic. That and the Italiabrava by Babyliss are the best hairdryers on the market!</li>
    <li> I was on the fence with this one. It&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve replaced my hairdryer. I have a BayBliss one and I figured because this one is listed as 2000 watts it would be more powerful and I&#x27;d be able to dry my hair faster. That didn&#x27;t really happen. As others have stated the power is there my hair gets blown around like crazy and I end up with little snarls and tangles but the heat just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. In fact it&#x27;s so powerful it would blow everything off of my sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try it a few days before making a decision but the price of this is really what made me return it. My old dryer was less money and just seems to work better in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powerful air flow made me try the diffuser which did nothing for drying my hair. I immediately took that off. Trying the other attachments to concentrate the airflow in one direction was difficult because when I move the dryer the attachment would be facing the wrong way. I&#x27;d have to adjust and trying to turn the adjustment when it&#x27;s hot is not a good idea. Not to mention everytime I&#x27;d try to spin it it would end up falling right off. It wasn&#x27;t my idea of a good time. I have a limited amount of time in the morning for getting ready and I didn&#x27;t have time to mess with the settings and attachments. I just want to dry my hair and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer it self was a little awkward to hold while drying. I usually grab it at the base of the dryer where the handle starts and on this dryer it wasn&#x27;t comfortable at all. I believe there was even a button in the way. It&#x27;s a little bulky as well. My BayBliss is much smaller and easier to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, if you&#x27;re looking for more power and good enough heat this would be for you. I&#x27;m not hoping my old dryer never breaks down.</li>
    <li> Soooo loud.  Great dryer minus the fact it is so darn loud.  I&#x27;ve gone back to my older dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is AMAZING! I have alot of thick frizzy hair and this blow dryer not only smoothed my ends it did it super fast! Im so happy with my purchase its worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has more power than any I&#x27;ve ever owned. It also has many settings to decrease or increase the amount of power and to change the temperature of the air. It seems like a professional salon dryer. I&#x27;m so happy I listened to other great reviews and bought it!</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer ever. I spend lots of money on my blow dryers.  One because I have a lot of thick curly hair and I like to straighten it. This works super fast and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Big and somewhat heavy, but this is the best hair dryer I have ever used on my super thick, naturally wavy and frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> New favorite dryer for professional use. I am a stylist and having the right dryer makes all the difference. This things blows hard and gets hot. I use it on medium heat and low speed and still cut my drying time in half with gorgeous results. Very little need for curling iron or flat irons when done. Time saver, light weight and I even like the diffuser:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so excited to write my review for this one. I was doing research about the best hairdryers, because there are millions of them out there.&lt;br /&gt;This one is perfect.  I have waist length, thick, wiry and wavy red hair that really enjoys frizzing and making my life unpleasant.  Finding hair products that work for me, is like my life&#x27;s mission.  This does get hot! I&#x27;m not sure what might be wrong with the other reviewer&#x27;s products, I think mine gets plenty hot.  Hot enough to dry it fast, without burning the mickey out of my scalp, and man does this thing have POWER.&lt;br /&gt;And  its quiet for how much fast air it can blow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this, it works great on my hair for volume, or diffusing, and even straightening.  Cuts my hair prep time in half.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this dryer if you have thick or coarse hair that needs to be smoothed or straightened. If you are the type of person who just flips the hair around and smooths with fingers, this might be too much dryer for you, but I have no experience with that kind of hair. This is my first professional hair dryer, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have medium coarse hair (mixed race, ringlets, coarse but not kinky. 3b maybe?) that is currently just below chin length. I&#x27;m super-skeptical about product claims, so I did a lot of research. I read an article about a comparison of several models that convinced me of the effectiveness of titanium, and I knew I wanted 2000 watts just cause I wanted as much power as possible. There aren&#x27;t too many dryers with those 2 features, so after reading the positive reviews, I decided on this model. From the first time I used it, I was very pleased. My hair was definitely softer and smoother. I never believed a hairdryer could make your hair softer, but this one definitely did. I can also dry my hair much more quickly, but I think that is because with this hair dryer, I am actually able to dry my hair like the hairdresser does (in big sections, using the curve of my head to smooth it out.) Previously, I always had to dry my hair in 1-2inch sections wrapping around and pulling with a round brush, which takes FOREVER. If I dry my hair that way with this dryer, it still takes about as long, but I don&#x27;t really get much better results so I don&#x27;t bother. CONS: 1. I still have to use a flat iron to smooth my ends. For the life of me, I can&#x27;t get smooth ends with a hair dryer. I was really hoping this dryer would solve that for me, but instead it has convinced me that it is my technique, not the dryer. 2. It really does get HOT. I have to use medium heat around the edges of my hairline, and that can still be a little intense. If you have a sensitive scalp, this might be too much dryer for you. 3. The nozzles seem kinda cheap. My last hair dryer had  nozzles that snapped on, which made it easier to rotate and change the angle. These nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when I try to rotate them. I can&#x27;t speak to some of the other complaints about this dryer like weight and noise. I wouldn&#x27;t call this dryer light or quiet, but it doesn&#x27;t seem particularly loud or heavy to me. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t want to give up the performance of this dryer for those features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps, and happy styling everyone!</li>
    <li> This product was listed as a 2000 Watt Ceramic/Ionic hairdryer.  It certainly had 2000 watts and was as loud and powerful as a jet engine in my bathroom.  However, despite the power, the heat was lacking.  And, it was so powerful, it was difficult to control fly-aways.  Not recommended for curly hair where you are trying to control frizz and defeat humidity.  Too powerful, but not hot enough to help.</li>
    <li> Solid dryer, does the job quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the hairdryer my hair stylist uses and when she recommended it to me, I knew I wanted to get it. It is absolutely wonderful! It&#x27;s much more powerful than any I&#x27;ve used and dries my hair in less than half the time of my old hair dryer. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer! I have very thick hair and lots of it so it takes a long time to dry. But it takes less than five minutes with this hairdryer. There&#x27;s one attachment that comes with it which diffuses the air wide and i use it to give more volume. I realized how miserable my drying experience was before this purchase. Well deserve 5 star rating!</li>
    <li> ***** exwife seemed to like it.</li>
    <li> I have a coworker who whenever she comes in with blown straight hair, it looks like she got it professionally done. I was looking to upgrade my blow dryer, and this was her recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was skeptical because it&#x27;s kind of expensive, but then I bit the bullet and got it. I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly, fine hair, and a lot of it, prone to frizz. It used to take me close to an hour and a half to blow dry my hair, then smooth over it with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blower dryer cuts my total hair-doing time in half! And I just touch up with a straightener on low heat (around my face, the top/back of my head). I use one of the concentrator attachments that comes with it (I believe the middle one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I didn&#x27;t touch up with a straightener for a few days, and my blow out really lasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone with hard-to-manage hair who wants a sleek and bouncy blow out.</li>
    <li> My Babyliss Pro from cosmetology school finally started burning out. I&#x27;ve been looking for a new dryer for a while, knowing the time was coming. While I loved my Babyliss, I did wish it had had the diffuser attachment for curls, so that was definitely something I was looking for in a new dryer. This dryer has all kinds of attachments for anything I could possibly need, and then some. I had heard good things from from my stylist &amp; other stylists about Rusk dryers &amp; decided to narrow my search field. Found this one at a fantastic price on Black Friday on another website, but it sold out before I could put in my order. Amazon had it listed at a very close price, so I gifted it to myself  for (early) Christmas ;) I absolutely love this dryer.</li>
    <li> Truly amazing results on thick, curly hair!  I usually dread drying my hair, but this one has changed my mind.  This dryer has cut my drying time by more than half and split ends are reduced.  It feels substantial and the cord is thick and long.  I am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love. Im a male african american and i have very course hair. With a round brush it gets my hair straight without needing a flat iron. It even dries my hair completely with cold air! My conair never was able to do that. Simply amazed with it. It id definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I find the product to be superior to those I had before. It is as good as my Chi dryer.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer with great styling ability! Very strong and gets very hot, but not too hot! I hope it lasts!</li>
    <li> I already have one like this, but I bought this one for my mother, and it&#x27;s working better than mine. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Amazing how much difference this dryer makes!! It dries my hair in fraction of time and straight if I want it straight. Or curly with diffuser. Lightweight was important feature. Great dryer.</li>
    <li> OMYGAH I LOVE IT. MY HAIR HAS NEVER HAD A HAIRDRYER THIS NICE DRY IT. It took half the time to dry my hair with this dryer than my old Bed Head dryer. Definitely recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a professional hair stylist with ten years experience.  This is the best dryer she&#x27;s used thus far.  The price was amazing, less than half of what I almost paid locally.  Drying hair with this is much like aiming your head at a turbine engine with very high velocity constant airflow and heat, it dries hair in about 1/3 the time of others she&#x27;s used.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this blow dryer and I love it. It&#x27;s not too small or too big. It has high watts so if you have wavy or curly hair and you want to straighten it without using a flat iron, this blow dryer will straighten it nicely with no frizz. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The buttons are touched to easily when holding it. Also there should be 3 speeds on the air blowing.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer. Love It</li>
