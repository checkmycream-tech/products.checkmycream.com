      <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
      <li>My nieces LOVE IT.</li>

      <li>They r cute</li>
      <li>even u put top coat</li>
      <li>I love this brand..never had a problem with any of them..</li>
      <li>Like most the designs I got.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and love the variety.</li>
      <li>I have natural nails and they look great. :-)</li>
      <li>The top coat of clear is very important.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, will order again.</li>
      <li>The designs are really sweet - fun colors and sparkles.</li>
      <li>The next morning, I removed all my old stuff, easily took off the new sticker &amp; put on my new flower stickers, they are great...</li>

      <li>These are so pretty.</li>
      <li>but they are pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>First, the cute little stickers I got, each page was different &amp; cute!!...only one kind wasn&#x27;t really my style...</li>
      <li>My wife bought this for herself and she really loves using the stickers on her finger nails.</li>
      <li>Very sparkly</li>
      <li>so I put it to the &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; on my old polish...I put one right on top of my old stuff &amp; left it for my day of.....cleaning fluids...scrubbing the kitchen, the bathroom &amp; dishes....</li>
      <li>There are a lot of pretty ones in here but maybe a few too many cartoon related.</li>
      <li>they are very thin though, which is good it wont look chunky under your topcoat but be very cautious peeling them off the backing.</li>
      <li>I love them, it&#x27;s been 3 days, only one little part of one sticker came off...</li>
      <li>Perhaps having a bundle of more sophisticated in one and whimsical in the other?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been to the pool, had to wash my hands a million times and am pretty rough during the day, changing diapers, taking care of kids, cooking, cleaning...</li>
      <li>Follow the directions and your nails will last at least a week or more depending how often our hands are in water.  </li>

<li> and I got these for some of the little girls there.</li>
<li> have repurchased them a few times..</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to remove in one piece</li>
<li> U just have to do it slow .</li>

    <li> these stickers are beautiful. they are very thin though, which is good it wont look chunky under your topcoat but be very cautious peeling them off the backing. GORGEOUS! will order again for sure!</li>
    <li> Perfect selection of nail art stickers for my 10 year old.  And boy do they stick. Follow the directions and your nails will last at least a week or more depending how often our hands are in water.  The top coat of clear is very important.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and love the variety.</li>
    <li> The designs are really sweet - fun colors and sparkles. The downside is that when you apply topcoat it can smear those colors.</li>
    <li> Great product and fantastic delivery. I received exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> took forever to get in and they were ok but i can buy better in a drug store</li>
    <li> These are great.... I love them. Very sparkly and I have gotten many compliments on them. I have natural nails and they look great. :-)</li>

    <li> They r cute but it&#x27;s just a sticker....u can put them on ur notebook rather than on ur nails cuz they won&#x27;t stay there longer even u put top coat</li>
    <li> Works great. I have not had any problems out of these. Like most the designs I got. Love doing my own nails.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, will order again.</li>
    <li> First, the cute little stickers I got, each page was different &amp; cute!!...only one kind wasn&#x27;t really my style...so I put it to the &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; on my old polish...I put one right on top of my old stuff &amp; left it for my day of.....cleaning fluids...scrubbing the kitchen, the bathroom &amp; dishes....it stayed on WITHOUT the suggested top-coat of polish...then I made dinner &amp; wrestled around with my toddler boys on the floor...the sticker survived it all!! The next morning, I removed all my old stuff, easily took off the new sticker &amp; put on my new flower stickers, they are great...A word of advice....peel back the sticker carefully or fold part of backing to remove them..they are sticky &amp; they will rip if you&#x27;re careful.. but they are pretty sturdy. I love them, it&#x27;s been 3 days, only one little part of one sticker came off...I&#x27;ve been to the pool, had to wash my hands a million times and am pretty rough during the day, changing diapers, taking care of kids, cooking, cleaning...I don&#x27;t have to worry about these peeling off in a day, I will definitely buy them again!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. I work at a hospital for youth and I got these for some of the little girls there. They were so happy!</li>
    <li> LOVE these stickers! So cute &amp; so many choices. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on them.</li>
    <li> Really cute stickers! Price is a little steep, but I loved them.</li>
    <li> Five star, I love all the design...</li>
    <li> I love this brand..never had a problem with any of them..have repurchased them a few times..great staying power..dont come off till you want to redo manicure.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty. I Haven&#x27;t had the chance to use them yet, but I am looking forward to using them soon.</li>
    <li> Lots of choices in the pack!  Good price</li>
    <li> The quality and vibrancy of the nail art is great for the price!</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for herself and she really loves using the stickers on her finger nails. She will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Awesome nail stickers, they actually stay on your nails and blend in. Don&#x27;t even look like stickers.</li>
