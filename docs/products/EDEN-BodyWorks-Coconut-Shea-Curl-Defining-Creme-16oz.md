      <li>Hair felt clean and moisturized afterward.</li>
      <li>We tried mixed chicks and liked it but for whatever reason my wife likes this one more.</li>
      <li>Very cool  thanks  </li>
      <li>I noticed right away reduced frizzy hair,softer hair, and</li>
      <li>I even achieved my first wash and go with this product on 4b/c hair.  </li>
      <li>This does exactly what it says on the video.  </li>
      <li>Says all natural and when I looked at the ingredients on Sally&#x27;s site natural ingredients were listed but when I received it it had a lot more ingredients listed on the jar...</li>

      <li>I highly, highly, highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well with my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The product is primarily used to keep my ends and overall hair moisturized.</li>
      <li>I have mixed (African/Indian) hair which has more of the African kinky but not curly waves, so</li>
      <li>On my fine curly hair, this pro &amp;#34;curl defining&amp;#34; creme made my hair look wet and greasy.  </li>
      <li>I really like how this product defined my natural curly pattern😘</li>
      <li>Perhaps her hair needs more moisturizing since she is swimming everyday this summer, before she can achieve a wash and go with this</li>
      <li>but I live how it makes my hair feel</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Mixed Chicks product, but it didn&#x27;t do much to define my curls, and I found that my hair wasn&#x27;t absorbing the product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my 2nd cowashing product and the first</li>
      <li>This product should be labeled as designed for African American hair, or more descriptive of the type of hair for which it is intended (like coarse kinky curls)!  </li>
      <li>I have very fluffy curls that tend to proof with most products.</li>
      <li>I guess so far I am sticking to Aussie Moist Conditioner until I can find a natural product that works for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>a wash n go while keeping my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>On my hair it produces a soft hold.</li>
      <li>I condition her hair with Coconut Oil in the shower, and decided to try this natural product as a leave in.  </li>
      <li>As I Am Naturally line</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, and the results are satisfying.</li>
      <li>I recently got rid of Blue Magic, and all the heavy hair greases, and decided to go natural with her hair and curls.  </li>
      <li>On dry hair it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for her hair.  </li>
      <li>Such a shame since I want to do a healthier, natural method for her hair.  </li>

<li> Just a tiny bit made my hair look flat and oily.</li>
<li> So far the only way I can keep her hair looking moist, and maintain her Shirley Temple curls all day long is if I wet her hair, and put Aussie Moist Conditioner in her hair without rinsing it out.  </li>
<li> It is just lovely...goes on well after wetting hair in shower,spread well over hair and only used a couple of small handfuls!Felt heavenly on my scalp and rinsed very well.</li>
<li> Twist hair (I did two strand flat twists) and cover with bonnet overnight.</li>
<li> I personally use pure coconut oil on my scalp but my wife feels its too thick or something for our daughter</li>
<li> I bought it at a beauty supply store, which did not have it displayed with the other products for African American hair.  </li>
<li> if I did not have a product like this I would not have any curls in my hair unless it&#x27;s the back part of my head when its wet.</li>
<li> Fine follicles, but very thick and tight curl pattern.</li>
<li> However with this product my hair was dry and straw-like.</li>
<li> Before I started using any products on my hair it was dry and lacked the luster I wanted for my curls.</li>
<li> once her hair dried, it was back to a big poof once again.  </li>
<li> It produced loose coily curls.  </li>
<li> I tried it both ways, on dry hair, and on wet hair.  </li>
<li> while it stayed wet.....</li>
<li> I use it on damp hair whenever I don&#x27;t use it on wet hair for a wash n</li>
<li> I then applied this to her hair wet after getting out of the shower.  </li>
<li> She is a quarter white, a quarter Korean, and half black.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other curl enhancing or defining products for my hair</li>
<li> My daughter has what might be referred to as mixed type of hair and its hard to find products which my wife feels work well for her.</li>
<li> It is trusted and never let&#x27;s me down.  </li>
<li> Works as described unlike other &amp;#34;curl defining&amp;#34; products and truly leaves little or no residue or build up.</li>
<li> This is a far less expensive solution than other alternatives.</li>
<li> Instead of curls I had dry, straight/wavy, hard hair.</li>
<li> Now, my curls are fluffy and bouncy....</li>
<li> go because the creme is very thick and probably won&#x27;t absorb into the hair well if used on dry hair.</li>
<li> I am still very heavy handed using products so it is also oily to the touch, but that should change as I master the use of styling</li>
<li> I have crazy mixed 3b/4a hair.</li>
<li> thick, coily, curly</li>
<li> Not for thin hair.</li>
<li> Yes, I like this product and it has become by base product from which others are judged.  </li>
<li> so I am very disappointed!</li>

    <li> Not for thin hair. Just a tiny bit made my hair look flat and oily.</li>
    <li> This product should be labeled as designed for African American hair, or more descriptive of the type of hair for which it is intended (like coarse kinky curls)!  On my fine curly hair, this pro &amp;#34;curl defining&amp;#34; creme made my hair look wet and greasy.  I bought it at a beauty supply store, which did not have it displayed with the other products for African American hair.  I&#x27;ll give it to one of my co-worker friends.</li>
    <li> very happy with the results. I noticed right away reduced frizzy hair,softer hair, and much better curl definition</li>
    <li> My curls have lasted BEAUTIFULLY! My friends and family gave me compliments  I have 4c hair and this is how I did it 1) Shampoo and deep condition 2) Apply leave - in conditioner to damp hair(I used Natually Mixed Silk) 3) Apply generous amount of EDEN curl defining creme 4) Twist hair (I did two strand flat twists) and cover with bonnet overnight. The product caked a bit in the twists but it didn&#x27;t flake. It seemed to melt by morning. 5) In the morning, spray with oil sheen, take out twists and arrange curls how you want them 6) Look all Ooh La Laa!</li>
    <li> I have very fluffy curls that tend to proof with most products. This cream is a perfect balance of hold and moisture, leaving my curls defined but not dried out or crunchy. I buy mine for 7.99 at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it says on the video.  I am totally impressed. My hair is very curly after using this product. Quite pleased.</li>
    <li> Says all natural and when I looked at the ingredients on Sally&#x27;s site natural ingredients were listed but when I received it it had a lot more ingredients listed on the jar...things I do not want on my hair so I am very disappointed!</li>
    <li> On time, well packaged and a great product.  This is a far less expensive solution than other alternatives.</li>
    <li> So fast so good. I used this product for a twist out. I&#x27;ve only used it once but I live how it makes my hair feel and it doesn&#x27;t show up in your hair later</li>
    <li> I have crazy mixed 3b/4a hair. Fine follicles, but very thick and tight curl pattern. When my hair dries, it goes POOF. No curl pattern. I&#x27;ve tried Mixed Chicks product, but it didn&#x27;t do much to define my curls, and I found that my hair wasn&#x27;t absorbing the product properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff? Works like magic. My hair just slurps it up, and my curls become shiny, bouncy, so much more managable. I highly, highly, highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Great product. It gives good long lasting moisture and curl definition.</li>
    <li> My finicky wife loved it for my daughters hair. My daughter has what might be referred to as mixed type of hair and its hard to find products which my wife feels work well for her. We tried mixed chicks and liked it but for whatever reason my wife likes this one more. I personally use pure coconut oil on my scalp but my wife feels its too thick or something for our daughter yet she feels this blend of coconut oil with the other stuff is perfect.</li>
    <li> Yes, I like this product and it has become by base product from which others are judged.  It is trusted and never let&#x27;s me down.  I even achieved my first wash and go with this product on 4b/c hair.  It produced loose coily curls.  Another good product for Wash and Go is the As I Am Naturally line and it produces a tighter coil and a different Wash and Go look.  My daughter who has more 4c than b does not achieve a wash and go with this product.  Perhaps her hair needs more moisturizing since she is swimming everyday this summer, before she can achieve a wash and go with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is primarily used to keep my ends and overall hair moisturized. On my hair it produces a soft hold. I am still very heavy handed using products so it is also oily to the touch, but that should change as I master the use of styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding trustworthy product.</li>
    <li> This isone of the best products I&#x27;ve tried. I always need a product that will provide some hold for my hair when doing a wash n go, twist out or braid out. This product provides me with just that. I use it on damp hair whenever I don&#x27;t use it on wet hair for a wash n go because the creme is very thick and probably won&#x27;t absorb into the hair well if used on dry hair. This product defines my curls excellently for a wash n go while keeping my hair soft and shiny. This stuff also smells excellent</li>
    <li> This is super moisturizing for my fine strands. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> It keeps my curls defined and hydrated</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! It&#x27;s my 2nd cowashing product and the first didn&#x27;t do anything. It is just lovely...goes on well after wetting hair in shower,spread well over hair and only used a couple of small handfuls!Felt heavenly on my scalp and rinsed very well. Hair felt clean and moisturized afterward. Its a keeper!</li>
    <li> I really like how this product defined my natural curly pattern😘</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well with my hair.  I have type 4... thick, coily, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;It felt moisturized...but NO curl definition...in fact, it poofed out MORE after using this.</li>
    <li> Before I started using any products on my hair it was dry and lacked the luster I wanted for my curls. Now, my curls are fluffy and bouncy....very healthy and sexy. This creme is my go to hair styler!</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed.  She is a quarter white, a quarter Korean, and half black.  I recently got rid of Blue Magic, and all the heavy hair greases, and decided to go natural with her hair and curls.  I condition her hair with Coconut Oil in the shower, and decided to try this natural product as a leave in.  I tried it both ways, on dry hair, and on wet hair.  On dry hair it didn&#x27;t do much of anything for her hair.  Her hair stayed poufy, and looking like a giant afro.  I then applied this to her hair wet after getting out of the shower.  Her hair looked great, and had the Shirley Temple looking curls.....while it stayed wet.....once her hair dried, it was back to a big poof once again.  Such a shame since I want to do a healthier, natural method for her hair.  So far the only way I can keep her hair looking moist, and maintain her Shirley Temple curls all day long is if I wet her hair, and put Aussie Moist Conditioner in her hair without rinsing it out.  I guess so far I am sticking to Aussie Moist Conditioner until I can find a natural product that works for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Searching for a product to give my hair  curls and coils I decided to try this product. The scent is pleasant and the creme is not overly thick. However with this product my hair was dry and straw-like. The product made my hair straight. I have a mixture of hair textures in the 2 category. Instead of curls I had dry, straight/wavy, hard hair. I did use the product as an after shampoo rinse out conditioner because I did not want to throw it away. The product worked well as a conditioner.</li>
    <li> Works as described unlike other &amp;#34;curl defining&amp;#34; products and truly leaves little or no residue or build up. I&#x27;ve tried other curl enhancing or defining products for my hair but this is the only one that I do not need to reapply every day. I had my hairdresser apply this to my hair and then did not reapply til about 10 days later when I needed a refresher. In the intervening days, I used just the Eden coconut shea leave-in (looks just like this but in a bottle) after spritzing with water and that was all I needed to have curls that were drawing comments about how moisturiszd my hair looked...and even maybe... a bit of curl envy! This product does not have to be slathered on to your hair to work. A little goes a long way, and the results are satisfying. It is especially gratifying to run my hand over my hair after the day is almost done and to be happy to note my hair does not feel overdry. I have mixed (African/Indian) hair which has more of the African kinky but not curly waves, so if I did not have a product like this I would not have any curls in my hair unless it&#x27;s the back part of my head when its wet.</li>
    <li> This is a good product!</li>
    <li> Very cool  thanks  you</li>
