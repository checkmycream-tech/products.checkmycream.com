<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered what I thought was going to be 120 applications of 10cc (20-30) application syringes.  What I RECEIVED was one single 10cc syringe (20-30 applications) with 2 teeth trays.  The product description makes it sound like you are going to get 120 applications or roughly 3-4 syringes.  No.  You get one.  See picture for what i actually got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description even claims that you&#x27;ll receive 120 applications.  It says this in the first line of the product description.  Quote from product description:  &amp;#34;Kit 120 Applications&amp;#34;.  It then contradicts itself AGAIN,  by saying (and I quote) &amp;#34;Our 10cc(ml) syringes are equal to 40 APPLICATIONS!!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use this product because the product description is A LIE (not Amazon&#x27;s fault, but rather the third party seller - Instant White Smile Wholesale) and returned it immediately.  Maybe it&#x27;s a great product, who knows.  But for 20-25 dollars there are sellers selling 10 syringes of the exact same item.  Upon everything else...the product picture shows a clip art of 500-pack.  So, am I getting 20-30 applications per syringe, 40 applications...120 applications...500?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY.  Unless you really enjoy calling Amazon customer service for a refund.</li>
    <li> Follow the other reviewers instructions regarding the trays, etc, but I used this product twice over the weekend for 15 minutes each time and it did work well.</li>
    <li> I just got this and used it for 15 mins per instructions. I stuffed my mouth with towel paper as I salivate a lot and used a lip makeup brush to brush each tooth with this stuff. I then put on the tray to keep my mouth in one comfy place. But after I washed I noticed I got some spots white only. I took my time covering each tooth so maybe this happened because of the tray ? Not sure but I&#x27;m not happy with the white spitting. I will give it a few trials and continue to review it here for you guys.</li>
    <li> Make sure you follow the directions for making the reservoirs conform to your teeth. The manufacturer&#x27;s claims for this product are true. My teeth were only moderately discolored and I saw results immediately.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff. It will get your teeth really white.  However, white is relative to each person starting point and there actual teeth color.  My dentist told me that at the very best ones teeth cannot get whiter than the whites of your eyeballs.    The key is to get very strong carbide peroxide like 44% or the most you can handle.  The reason why is to whiten your teeth really white and to do it quickly.    If you have sensitive teeth do not try this.    First make good impression of your teeth with a plastic mouthpiece just like the ones used for sports.  Make sure you put it in boiling water and take a good impression don&#x27;t just use it out of the package.  Or get one that is specifically used for teeth whitening.  I like to trim down any part that goes over my gums just so that the carbide peroxide doesn&#x27;t spread over my gums and burn my gums but it is not necessary.  Next  Brush teeth &amp; Floss  Then  Start numbing your mouth and teeth with some benzocaine or xylocaine. You can get this over the counter. Do a very good job and do it several times.  Next your benzocaine probably came in a syringe like tube with a plunger. Put one small block of carbide peroxide where each tooth in pression is on the mouthpiece tray.    It is up to you whether you want to do your top and bottom teeth at the same time or one at a time.  I suggest doing them at the same time.    Leave them in at least 20 minutes. They may come with some directions if it says to leave them in longer leave them in longer.    If for any reason while you have the trade then they start to hurt really bad even though you have numbed your mouth take them out immediately.      This could happen if your enamel has been worn down and you&#x27;re not aware of it or you have very sensitive teeth.  Infact people with sensitive teeth should not try this.    If it does start to hurt just stop the process immediately and you will be fine.</li>
    <li> it doesnt really do too great a job, and can seriously BURN and be irritating. i&#x27;m sure if i kept using it long enough consistently it would have looked better but it BURNS!! OUCH!</li>
    <li> way too strong to use alone for the 20 mins... i used with my regular tooth paste to brush; worked really good!!!</li>
    <li> Works good,keep off the gums the best you can though.</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised. Very strong. Don&#x27;t overheat the mouth guards when forming them.</li>
    <li> Works great and was shipped right away. Very pleased !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t need the trays but the solution is great.</li>
    <li> the gel is really good but i had a hard time forming the trays to my teeth but it still works</li>
    <li> This 44% is VERRY strong. i noticed results after first use. My teeth have already been professionally bleached, but i wanted something to use for touch ups. I can not see using this product for longer than 30mins. you could definitely do damage to your Gums and teeth!. My gums were red on the first use when i put the solution directly on my customized tooth tray (which i have done for previous touch-up solutions). However, it became clear that this solution should not be in ANY contact with your gums. Even after wiping the excess off, my gums were red and very sensitive -- i have never had tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please use caution with this product. I do NOT recommend using the tray that comes with the product. there is no way to avoid it from getting on your gums. Consider a cotton swap and apply directly on the tooth - carefully, keeping your mouth open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope that helps!!</li>
    <li> Great item, exactly as I expected. Would buy again, and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works well but keep it off of gums- it can sting them</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff and it DOES NOT WORK!!!  I had been using 35% by Opalescence and worked really good and you have to buy it online as the dentist will not sell it to you and take it home.  You have to sit in the office and they will only leave it on for 1/2 hour.  So, I bought 35% and used it on my top teeth and used the 44% on my bottom teeth and it did not work at all.  Get it from another vendor or buy another brand.</li>
    <li> This system works really well. I did put too much of the solution in the holder and got blisters on my gums.  Now my teeth did bleach out really good.</li>
    <li> Stuff works faster and better than anything I&#x27;ve used before.  I held off using it for nearly a month after receiving it, scared off by all those reviewers who warned about white gums, sensitivity, etc.  I had NO untoward reactions, and I left the trays in my mouth for more than an hour.  More economical than what I was using And more effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still evaluating the product but I can tell you that you better NOT get any of this on your gums or you&#x27;ll regret it. This stuff is strong!!! There are indeed 20 - 30 applications per tube.&lt;br /&gt;You need to trim the trays before use, too. I think it&#x27;s a keeper.............</li>
    <li> I am a smoker of 30 years. I used a Q tip and I am very pleased with the results. Myself and my wife noticed the difference after 2 15  minute applications. Though I know it hurts many people&#x27;s gums I have had no pain what so ever. Certainly worth purchasing as opposed to the very expensive \\&quot;professional\\&quot; cleaning. Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> This product works good, but is very dangerous for your gums. The smallest amount on your gums, bleach them white and is painful. Works great though!</li>
    <li> Couldnt use it as i am allergic to it.  Burns my gums like crazy within seconds.</li>
    <li> Great strong gel.Whitens so fast and ive tried alot of teeth whitening gels.This is my favorite now.Because its 44% and it doesnt cause tooth sensitivity as much as the 35% cheaper ones.I use it with customized teeth trays.This Gel has also made me receive compliments on my teeth.Great Buy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Great product. I would order it again!</li>
    <li> Lots of product here to apply.  Great information was included to help in proper usage too. First application was OK.</li>
    <li> This product did not whiten my teeth.  I even combined it with an accelerating blue light.  It did make my teeth very sensitive.</li>
    <li> This works!! It&#x27;s honestly the best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for my teeth. The molding is kinda hard, so I just started putting it on my toothbrush with toothpaste. It also works like that.</li>
    <li> I like the gel very much.  It has helped keep my teeth on the lighter side :)  I am not a fan of the dual tray.. but that&#x27;s just me. I had a great experience and appreciate the product/services.</li>
    <li> It whitened a bit afraid I didn&#x27;t use it as often as probably need for ultimate whitening but I have very sensitive teeth and this exacerbated the sensitivity which it does warn you about.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again its a good price and works just like stuff you get at the store only cheaper. It can burn your gums if your not  careful.</li>
    <li> God damn!!! I had to go to my dentist the day after I used this, it burned my gums and my teeth were so sensitive even to air I wasn&#x27;t able to eat hot or cold for like a week! although it does white your teeth and you can notice even at one application, its too much for my teeth in my own opinion!!</li>
    <li> Works faster and more effectively than the stuff I got from my dentist&#x27;s office, at a fraction of the price. Note: If this solution comes into contact with your gums, it will turn them white and/or red for a while. Your teeth will probably hurt a day or two afterward, too. Expect that with a solution of this strength. But after one use my teeth looked noticeably whiter. After two uses, impressive, and after three uses, my teeth look dazzling. Worth a bit of suffering if you&#x27;re as vain about your teeth as I am.</li>
    <li> This ish is strong it removed my plaque on a back tooth in one hour... my teeth looks great and people are always asking who does your teeth... lol just don&#x27;t over do it.... great product</li>
    <li> It was decent, I really did not see that many results from this product which was extremely disapointing to me.</li>
    <li> This works great at a fraction of the cost you would pay to have the treatment done at a dentist office. I recommend reading instructions fully and don&#x27;t just give up after a few treatments. I was a bit sensitive to the gel so I didn&#x27;t put quite as much in the tray and didn&#x27;t leave it on for as long and I can see results after 3 treatments.</li>
    <li> Works for me and my family but it will hurt your gums if you leave on too long or aren&#x27;t careful when you apply.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a few months and saw results. I cut the mouth piece because it is pretty thick, but once I cut it, it fit perfectly. My teeth also looked whiter.</li>
    <li> I thought that I was making a good purchase since this gel is stronger than what I normally use (the Opalescense 35%)... but boy what a mistake I made!  This does NOT do a great job of lifting your teeth as you would think with this strength of gel and I&#x27;ve used it every day since receiving it.  Not only that &#x3D; it leaves them looking dull and not like &amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34; like my other gel does.  I was very very sad about this purchase.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a year anytime time I had free time. This thing works! Does it make your teeth bleachy white, NO. But it makes it regular white and people do take notice. I&#x27;ve gotten complements months after I stopped using it. Warning, the drooling is going to be serious and don&#x27;t sallow the solution.</li>
    <li> Better product than what you get at dental office!!!  Love product shelf life is long great!!! The best whitening ever!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!!! I previously used a bleaching product from my dentist. I used that product for 1 full month and it did not work as well as this product did in 3 days. I could actually see results with the first application. My teeth got several shades whiter even the one that had sustained trauma when I was a child. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great smile. It is well worth the price and the blue light was an added bonus. If you want whiter teeth get this product because it really works.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the product yet but it arrived days before expected. Instructions supplied could be better.</li>
    <li> This product did not work, I used it as directed and it was messy. I stopped using it and discarded it. I use the Crest whitening strips and they work great.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 kits. This product can really hurt your teeth/gum if you mess this up. I applied the gel to my teeth with a Q tip instead. My teeth are like 7 shades whiter in 3 x 15 minute tries in a span of 2 days.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. My ex-husband is a dentist, delighted to tell you he recommends it because the peroxide is safe for whitening.</li>
    <li> followed the instructions perfectly, however, I merely submerged the trays in hot water(as instructed) for less than 5 seconds and they shriveled up, becoming USELESS. Very displeased. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, works.  Strong.  I use with a dentist made form so all I need to do is remember to wear it.  I drink red wine and can get my teeth mega white with it.</li>
    <li> There were noticeable results after the first 40 minute session. Good price too with reasonable postage charges. Does what it says in the tin.</li>
    <li> Burns really bad and barely worked</li>
    <li> works as advertised!! Much cheaper than anything else that you would find online and worked great.  If anything it was a tad too strong..</li>
    <li> wow! very good item, came in 3 days with standard shipping. whitens really quickly</li>
    <li> Not fair to rate it as 1 star because the product was missing from the package they sent (it was opened when I got it inside the sealed box with many other items ordered).  I rate it a 1 because they did not give me the choice to exchange it for a new unopened product and are charging me to ship it back.  Basically I am paying for the experience of anticipating the delivery and receiving nothing with no option to exchange it.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried many whiteners through my dentist and others store bought, all in an attempt to find something that worked well. I have not had good results that warranted the money spent, until I found this product. Finally! Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> definitely noticed and immediate different. i didnt mold the trays initially but im going to for future application. people say it &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; after 30 min...i dont think its so bad. its more of a tingle. id say leave it on as long as possible. my teeth are kinda messed up color wise from fluoride ruining them so theyre all different spotty shades, but overall it made them noticibly whiter. gonna continue this treatment and brushing with xylitol.</li>
    <li> 3stars cos I havent used it. After purchasing then I stupidly decided to just check the reviews. Though there are many positive and negative , the few negative ones managed to scare me to death. ESP cos some people said it gave them badly sensitive teeth and that&#x27;s my greatest fear. I tried it once though but removed it before a second. Will try sometime soon and that spatula or whatever it is was so big and almost choked me damn</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading a few reviews that stated this product was an effective teeth whitening product.  It is not. I have used it on several occasions and the only thing it does it burn my gums and whitens them.  The reviews were right about it being a strong product but it does not whiten teeth--at least not mine.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and will neither be purchasing this product again nor suggesting it to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> This actually took off surface stains from restorative work that my dentist told me would need to be redone. Also several shades lighter after only one 15 minute application. No sensitivity after which I attribute to the short bleaching time. I actually didnt use the boil and bite trays provided and simple used rolled gauze to keep my lips off of my teeth and painted the gel on with a q-tip instead.</li>
    <li> Tray is a little too big and wide</li>
    <li> Messy and not effective</li>
    <li> This lasts a long time and works as good as the stuff I get from the dentist.  I drink a lot of coffee and this helps in between dental visits.</li>
    <li> my gums are white as snow and my teeth did turn a liitle whiter  if the instructions wer better i think i wouldnt have had an issue</li>
    <li> I am disappointed.I really thought that my teeth would whiten better than they did. They are still discolored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product twice, used it twice, and have been disappointed twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I&#x27;ll have to pay a dentist an exorbitant fee just to get my teeth whitened.</li>
    <li> Grate product , takes less time to whiten your teeth just don&#x27;t leave on longer than instructions say.&lt;br /&gt;arrived on time</li>
    <li> Works but did not whiten as well as i hoped.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t quite what I expected. The syringe that the product came out of was constantly clogged, the trays do not mold to your teeth if they are not perfectly straight, when I use this product I do notice a whiter smile but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> hard to shape the tray and  keeping the product from getting in the mouth</li>
    <li> The product was received promptly. However, the syringe is unlabeled and no where in instructions (insert) do you read the words \\&quot;44% carbomide peroxide\\&quot; nor is 44% seen in the ingredient list--the word \\&quot;carbomer\\&quot; is listed as the 4th ingredient.Is \\&quot;Whitening System Advanced\\&quot; the name of the company? What is the country of origin of this product? The insert doesnt have the manufacturers name of business or how to contact them. This doesnt follow the Basic Label Requirements in the US. Does it contains 44%, 22%, 16%, or 35% carbomide peroxide?  How can I be sure what this syringe really contains without a proper label?  I would be fired if i left an unlabeled syringe around at work to harm others. Whether or not it works is to be determined.</li>
    <li> I tried this a couple of times just in case...but I don&#x27;t see any results. Not in bright daylight, not in dim light, ...it&#x27;s like that trick--The Emperor Has No Clothes. Don&#x27;t believe what anyone tells you; It&#x27;s not gold, it&#x27;s nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed. It promised \\&quot;instant results\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t even see snail-rate results. It&#x27;s a bust. I should have known better. Back to Crest Whitening Strips. At least that provides results, after awhile.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the good reviews it got, but it did not work for me at all!. The trays were very uncomfortable to wear. I only used it for 4 days though because my teeth became very sensitive and they hurt.It says to avoid getting gel on gums but eventually your going to get a little on the gums and it burns a little and makes your gums white but it&#x27;s only temporary. I wanted something that whitens my teeth not my gums! Would i recommend product? NO!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, my whitestrips were easier and faster though. I reccommend this only to people who want the occasional touch up and don&#x27;t want to spend the $50 on a box of whitestrips. Can make teeth really sensitive, which is something i never experienced with whitestrips.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT&lt;br /&gt;Been using for over a year now and Im happy</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me maybe a good product for someone else</li>
    <li> Arrived promtly.  We have to wait to see if it works.  My husband has only used it twice so far.  No change yet.  Too early to rate it.</li>
    <li> This is the second SEALED 10ml NEW STRONGEST 44% carbamide peroxide teeth whitening gel that ive purchased but this one doesnt seen as strong as the 1st I feel like a bait and switch has jus happened like the switched it with jus 20% could just be me but doubt it but anyway i did get a suringe with mouth piece as described as far as it being 44% carbamide peroxide teeth whitening gel...that TBD...</li>
    <li> It worked the same as store bought products. I did not see the change that was advertised for this product.</li>
    <li> whitens well, and was much less expensive than whiteners in the store.  the brightness didn&#x27;t last though, makes me wonder if it might possibly make teeth more susceptible to staining, but I have no way t know for sure.</li>
    <li> I have custom molds and have used whiteners for many years.  This product is simply too strong. I bought it in the vein of &amp;#34;stronger, faster, better&amp;#34;. But it is unusable. Even with great care, the solution seeps to your gums and where it touches, it BURNS. My gums were bleached white - even with using it exactly as instructed.</li>
    <li> this stuff really works,it is an economical size with two good applications in each.</li>
    <li> Tried this as directed for 4 days straight and saw no difference.  Had a new crown which was whiter than tooth next to it as a gauge, hoping to match the color but didn&#x27;t even come close</li>
    <li> Works great! If not used correctly it can whiten your gums and cause sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it had the highest intensity I could find, and I got exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;m getting married in May and I didn&#x27;t want to look back at the pictures and think I didn&#x27;t do everything I could to look my best on my big day. My teeth are noticeably whiter and I&#x27;m happier for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note, like others have, that this will burn your gums if your not careful. I tried using a Q-Tip to Apply but it wasn&#x27;t even enough to get a nice coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the best results by staggering the days I do the tops and bottoms. I put the gel on one mouth guard put it in either the top or bottom of my mouth and then try to lay as close to flat on my back as possible. I find that gravity makes the gel run and laying down helps to prevent that.</li>
    <li> 1st time using this I just went at it, and caked the mouth guard with the jell, you do not wanting it touching your gums, it eats away at them quicker then most products. If you just put it at the bottom so it&#x27;s only on your teeth, you&#x27;ll see a differance in a 2 days</li>
    <li> This is very strong, but that&#x27;s expected. Whitened my teeth very well in only two applications with very little sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Pretty strong so only keep on for about 20 minutes. It may burn your gums; what I mean is that if the tips of your gums turn white, they have been burned. Not to worry though! It goes away in about 30 minutes. So use a timer to see how long the gel works for you.</li>
    <li> I use intelliWhite and love how it applies but I ran out so I opted for something cheaper! I use bumpers for my teeth so that It soaks up the saliva (You can buy 2000 bumpers for $18 on amazon) and I kept the pen from intelliWhite to apply this stuff and it works great lol I place the bumpers in first and then make sure my teeth are completely dry and I set the bumpers and keep my mouth open (smiling position) and apply the product with the pen (painting motion) and let it sit anywhere from 15-40 minutes depending on my mood. I have used the mouth pieces in the past and it works GREAT but I prefer not to since saliva gets mixed in with the formula and it gets in my mouth. With the bumpers I don&#x27;t get anything, although, it sometimes gets on my gums a little and behind my lips and at times the tip of my tongue (BECAREFUL it stings so make sure you wipe it right away) The bumpers are a lifesaver though. I still have the mouthpieces that are unaltered so I&#x27;m thinking of using the bumpers and then just setting them to keep my teeth from touching anything else. Overall, I used it once and see a tremendous difference already! If I had the money for intelliWhite, I would buy in a heartbeat cuz your teeth/gums don&#x27;t have that sensitive feeling and it has safer chemicals rather than this stuff. Since I am on a budget, this is what I will be using &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I was excited about all the positive reviews however this product has done nothing for me.  The trays are awful and don&#x27;t fit correctly. I have gotten the gel on my gums and it did not burn at all. I also have not had any sensitivety to my teeth.  I have seen no difference in the color of my teeth and am wondering if the strength is really 44%</li>
    <li> My self esteem has never been higher. I am getting compliments and i just feel like i WANT to smile more. Worth every penny and it was easy to use</li>
    <li> This product is ok for in-between whitening. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for someone expecting bright white teeth after just one use. I&#x27;m on my third, and I&#x27;ve not noticed any difference. It arrived before I expected it too, and was sealed, and packaged nicely, and securely.</li>
    <li> I am still using this product as I review it but I can notice a definite improvement. I have recommended this to my friends and will continue to use it. I did not boil my trays and they work wonderful that way for me.</li>
    <li> Messy and doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I bought several thinking it would work and I&#x27;d be set.  Now I&#x27;m stuck</li>
    <li> The mouth guard things are garbage... Order good ones! When u try to warm them &amp; form them they either don&#x27;t do anything or melt into a mess</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already seen an improvement by using this. I read the reviews prior to using it and tried applying it with a Q-Tip first. I found that it was too hard for me to keep my lips open enough to get my teeth (I have a snaggle tooth). So I put the gel in the mouthguard and put that in. I didn&#x27;t form the mouthguard to my teeth. I honestly haven&#x27;t had any burning/pain/gum whitening. After I take the mouthguard out my teeth do feel as if they are tired, like I had been clenching a lot but that just could be the mouthguard. I&#x27;d definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how long to leave it on. Doesn&#x27;t say anything about boiling trays, how much to use, how often, etc.</li>
    <li> Whitening Gel works great but the mouth pieces I can do without. I will not use those mouth things again. Much too big with gives off a lot of discomfort. I just spread the gel on my teeth with a QT and grin big time for 20 minutes. I feel like an idiot for that 20 minutes but the results are splendid.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I wanted to see what I’d look like with Joe-Biden-blinding-white teeth, but you can only work with what you have.  I have the type of teeth that are a little translucent and they’re as white as they’re going to get, due to the color of the dentin inside.  I have lighter spots on my lower front teeth that have been there since they came in.  Now those spots… wow.  Very bright.  Many will have better results than I.  The product came quickly and is very affordable.  It was immediately apparent that this stuff is in a different class than peroxide-based whiteners.  It was hard to keep the trays in my mouth for 15 minutes, but vanity is a powerful motivator.  It caused the gums around my teeth to turn light temporarily, but were back to normal the next time I thought to look.  Hey, for 8 bucks, why not try?</li>
    <li> whitened but not as much as i thought it would. i didnt feel any sensitivity or anything bad to my gums like others have mentioned.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say whether or not it would work, since the gag reflex it induced was enough to prevent me from trying it a second time.</li>
    <li> I used this only one time so far and am blown away by how amazing it is! My teeth have never been whiter!</li>
    <li> I bought the light to go with this and worked great, i would suggest buying them together shipped promptly easy but very messy to use</li>
    <li> works great whitened my teeth I am very pleased only needed to use it a couple of days 4 times a day</li>
    <li> I was skeptical since I read some negative reviews about this product. So I used it for 10 mins each time only. The result was ok. I did see some result. The tray was ok too.</li>
    <li> I thought i would have saw a diffrence after at least 4 times. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this item again but at least it was worth a shot.</li>
    <li> I had no problem came as promised and works like a charm. great deal for the price. has made my teeth wihiter</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works. I lined the trays, inserted the trays, my mouth instantly began to water. What in the world do you do with the &#x27;water&#x27;. Definitely NOT swallow. I kept removing and replacing, I didnt last 15 minutes. My teeth are naturally white, so I haven&#x27;t noticed the difference. I will try it again really soon, and keep ya posted.</li>
    <li> Received the product in a timely manner even though it was the holiday season. I am pleased with the results so far of the bleaching jell. I already had trays made by a dentist and was looking for a more cost effect bleaching agent than my Dentist offered.  I recommend giving this one a try. Peace and Love from Tammi in Dallas 2013</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth. DONT BUY THIS. Your teeth will hurt for weeks. In fact I had to go to dentist for pain meds</li>
    <li> And my gums bled. Dangerous whitening gel! I just threw it away. Not worth risking your teeth! Beware of this gel!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference!</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for a week now and do see a dramatic difference in my teeth. At first you may be skeptical about using this but it really is a good product. Now there are some things you need to know before using this.&lt;br /&gt;1. It is very strong and if used wrong, it will turn your gums white for a few hours&lt;br /&gt;2. DO NOT follow the instructions for the trays that come with this, just leave them unmolded to get better results.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply gel to each individual tooth with a q-tip, then apply the trays.&lt;br /&gt;4. Do not get onto gums or lips. I know it&#x27;s hard to keep completely off gums but try to get as little on them as possible to avoid having white gums for a few hours and more burning.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use for 30 minutes exact.&lt;br /&gt;5. It does burn, but the results are worth it and it manageable&lt;br /&gt;6. Don&#x27;t get discouraged if you get a few white spots on your teeth at first, this will whiten your whole tooth, and all your teeth you apply it too.&lt;br /&gt;7. Unless you have the dentist sucky thing they have, you are going to accumulate a lot of saliva in your mouth while this is in. That&#x27;s obvious, but again, its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK</li>
    <li> the chlorine odor from the whitener is so overpowering, it makes it tough to breathe while you are using it. wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item. i didn&#x27;t find it to whiten my teeth any better than drug store white strips.</li>
    <li> This whitening gel is very strong..really makes a difference with whitening..but burns the heck out of your mouth..gums...tongue..lips...the burns healed up in a day or 2..so it was worth it to me..teeth look great!only used it once!!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Will burn gums easily.  Best to rub something on your gums before bleaching teeth.  Start with 20 minutes and build up from there. I use Remineralization Gel after bleaching.  I use sensitive toothpaste a week before bleaching and a week after.</li>
    <li> This product works better than a professional bleaching at my dentist.  The tube lasts a long time I am on my 3rd month and whiten my teeth every 2 -3 weeks and still have half a tube left.  It hasn&#x27;t dried out in the tube and the strength is as good as the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was great, arrived way before expected time and it really works! I would recommend this to anyone! Very impressed with product and service.</li>
    <li> Do not let is touch your gums, it will burn them. If you are very careful to just place the gel on your teeth it works well.</li>
    <li> Disappointing,  I tried it on my bottom teeth only, because Crest White Strips, which work well on my upper teeth, don&#x27;t stay on my very small bottom teeth. Even though I followed the instructions, I had to remove it after having it on for only three minutes because I felt my gums burning. I&#x27;m not saying it is a bad product. It could be I didn&#x27;t do the tray exactly right. I may have my dentist make a tray, and try the solution again. I didn&#x27;t get blisters; I was afraid the burning would lead to blisters.</li>
    <li> For the price and excellent results i got i just thought this product deserves a thorough review, and NO i am not a seller or whatever, just a very pleased user of this product. I am very much skeptical because of the price and it seemed \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot; but I just tried it anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;The package was very simple. A syringe of gel and 2 mouth guards and a how to use card. Shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a review here that they recommended using a q-tip when applying the gel. I personally used a floss with a cane like pick at the end to apply the gel on each tooth for a more even coating. I ended up damaging one of the mouth guards when i followed the instruction to put in hot water because it just shrunked -_- PLEASE DON&#x27;T even bother doing it coz It didn&#x27;t really make a difference, mouthguard is mouth guard. The only inconvenient part of applying the gel is smiling for a long period of time. your lips or gums cannot touch the product or it will be irritated. I had little to no sensitivity like what other reviewers said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are naturally yellowish so I was told that it can&#x27;t be whitened since it&#x27;s their natural color but I cannot believe how this product changed that belief and delivered AMAZING RESULTS in just 1 WEEK Of use.It was above and beyond what I expected for a $6 dollar whitening product!! I am so happy with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanna help out future buyers. First, I DID NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCIONS written in the card but I made my own steps to achieve the best possible results FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STEPS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Brush your teeth like you normally do. (for teeth to be clean)&lt;br /&gt;2. UPPER TEETH: SMILE BIG. Apply a tiny dot onto the floss pick and apply to each tooth. Make sure it doesn&#x27;t touch the gums.&lt;br /&gt;3. after applying put the mouth guard so teeth and lips do not touch.&lt;br /&gt;4. Wait 20-30 mins. I recommend lying down your bed or couch  so you don&#x27;t salivate and the product goes everywhere in your mouth&lt;br /&gt;5. RINSING:Gargle with water and brush the part where you apply the product. Rinse with more water.&lt;br /&gt;6.Repeat steps 2-5 for lower teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to expect on 1st day: You will see white spots on your teeth, it&#x27;s completely normal and will just fade over the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that this review helped those who are gonna buy the product.It really works and I definitely recommend it :D</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as I thought it would, I&#x27;m on day 5 and I don&#x27;t really notice much of a difference, it also whitens unevenly. But it does recomment 20 or so uses, so we will see how things turn out after 20 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure that this gel is what it says.... I have used 44% peroxide before and this doesn&#x27;t seem as strong. The trays work well though and conform to your teeth when boiled. I&#x27;d just get a different gel.</li>
    <li> but not as directed, too strong to use everyday for 7 days. Used for 3 days instead. saw a difference on the third day. if you can handle it... go for it</li>
    <li> It did not work it totally sucks! It did nothing but make me drool I was mad as ever! And when I talk to them and told them they said they can refund my money! The package came with no instructions and then I told them so they emailed them to me! For all you know it could be hair gel in a tube just to let you know and I read all the reviews thinking well maybe ill give it a shot even though I saw bad ones I still said lets see and guess what im very upset!</li>
    <li> I Like this product alot. My wife has a more sensitive mouth and was a little strong for her ; so I would suggest if you are sensitive also ,use less strength to avoid discomfort.</li>
    <li> tried using this once so far and I must say the trays are very hard to mold. i used boil water and i had to use extreme boiling water it gets loose a little but it is still not molding exactly to my teeth shape. I&#x27;ve tried over and over.</li>
    <li> The product did not have enough information about manufacturer and I was very surprised by that fact.  It is also is extremely strong only a very very small amount should be used.  I am not sure I will continue to use it, my teeth are really too sensitive for the product</li>
    <li> It actually only has about 10 uses when used with the supplied trays. The trays are larger, thicker and less pliable than others. So, they waste product and irritate gums.</li>
    <li> this product made no difference on my teeth, the white strips work better. I even used it in the tanning bed for a week to see if the uv lightes would help and nope it made no difference.</li>
    <li> The product works very well even though you don&#x27;t get a lot of the product, but when I put the trays in hot water to mold to my teeth they shrunk up to almost nothing.  I bough different trays and us the rest of the whitening gel.</li>
    <li> After using it twice I see some changes.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth is getting whiter. Great product.</li>
    <li> i dont think it worked</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  Easy to use and does the trick.  After the second application both my husband and myself noticed how white our teeth had become.  Will use and purchase this product again.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> gel works very well! dosent have a terrible taste if it gets out of the mouthguard. the mouth guards are difficult to mold, but thats my only complaint!</li>
    <li> this is the best teeth whitener ive used and by far the best i have owned the nitewhite excel 3 22% and all i have to say is that pared with this 44 percent it works wonders i also used a white light so im a happy camper. I recommend this product to everyone! the trays that come with it are Excellent they are reach all your back teeth and front they mold very well and This was a Great buy for me i got Every penny worth out of this product!</li>
    <li> GREAT! Just don&#x27;t get the gel on your teeth (like it says in the instructions).</li>
    <li> I like it, this particular blend is very strong and burned my gums a bit. I was smart enough to take it off and give a thorough rinse. Works well.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003Y0504E 10ml NEW STRONGEST 44% carbamide peroxide teeth whitening gel + trays (20-30 applications)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works very well and I am pleased with the results. Product is very easy to use and didn&#x27;t burn my gums.</li>
    <li> I tried... i followed all the directions ... molded the guards to me teeth... left it on for the right time. But nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;The guards just don&#x27;t stay on... they kept falling off despite my attempts. So... i tried just brushing the solution with a makeup brush.. this also did nothing. I have accepted that i got what i paid for. So... I bought Crest professional strips... they were WAYYY more expensive ($59 on amazon)  but i am actually seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It was a waste of $8..</li>
    <li> Loving this bleach!  It is working really well, and my teeth are whitening up very nicely!  I tried the trays that came with it, but they were bulky and uncomfortable in my small mouth, so have just been using the trays my dentist made me years ago.  I would recommend using professional trays with this gel.  It came with one large syringe, which is quite a bit of bleach.  It has a sort of bland, icky taste to it but nothing unbearable.  Got this for the $7.99 cost and it&#x27;s definitely worth it!  Hope the price stays low so I can get more when I need it.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve tried other whitening methods in the past and this by far is the best. If you keep it on longer than 30 minutes it does make your teeth sensitive because it is one of the stronger whiteners on the market. I found that using it every other day for 20 minutes was enough for a dramatic difference. Great buy, comes with trays you can customize to fit your mouth for optimal results! Love this! Highly recommend if you have an occasion or just want whiter and brighter teeth after a few uses!!!</li>
    <li> I have already been to my dentist and had professional trays made up, so this stuff worked great for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it prior to having the professional trays made by your dentist, though, as it is strong and has a bit of a bad taste. No problems with this item at all doing what it was intended to do, although I did not use the molding trays that they included and wouldn&#x27;t recommend them. It got here quick after I placed my order and was a bigger syringe than I&#x27;d expected, which was nice. Great consistency of the product...not too runny or hard to spread in the trays. Would certainly recommend to anyone in need of dental bleach who has pro trays already and isn&#x27;t wanting to spend a fortune at the dentist to purchase bleach. One word of advice to anyone bleaching, though....***DO NOT DRINK TEA OR SODA WITHOUT USING A STRAW WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OR SO OF USE TO AVOID YOUR TEETH BEING DISCOLORED AND THEREFORE RENDERING THE BLEACH USELESS** I had to learn that the hard way, but once I did the product had no problem whitening my teeth back up after two or three sessions. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I got my syringe and my trays and that&#x27;s it. No instructions on how to do it, how long to leave it on, how often to do it nothing.</li>
    <li> This product is just as good at what you buy at the dentist office. Worked great. I had professional trays from a prior dental visit that I used so I can not comment on the trays that come with the whitening gel.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t burn my gums at all, works perfectly. Definitely would buy this again for sure. Great price too !!!</li>
    <li> But hater having used a zoom kit it&#x27;s hard to compare any over the counter whitener. These do the job in my pre made dental trays and don&#x27;t cause much sensitivity like the zoom ones do.</li>
    <li> Great stuff if your gums can take it. Just make sure you do not use to much and rinse your mouth well when you are finished using it. does whiten well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work just made my mouth sensitive and I followed directions.</li>
    <li> used it for 5 days, never let i mean never the gel in your gums it will make them white for days it looks ugly and i see no change in my teeth</li>
    <li> I did not think much of this product. I have bought a previous one with lower % and was better. I would not recommend this particular one.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and you get plenty.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. As long as you use it everyday for 15 minutes or every other day for 30 you will see the difference right away. I used it like this for two weeks and I am very happy.  PS. Try to cut down any mouthguard you are using to barely above your gum line because the gel can sting a lot and turn your gums white. (temporarily, like 30 minutes, but is gone if you immediately use the remineralization gel for 30) Good product that works. (Remineralization gel sold seperately, but so worth it. )</li>
    <li> Does not work at ALL.  Do not waste your money on this junk, and I do mean JUNK.  YOu get what you pay for and when you spend $9 for a whitening product, you get crap.  I feel the advertising for this is bullcrap.</li>
    <li> Overall, its a great product but the application process isnt that great. Its a bit messy and after a while, I stopped using it because it just wasnt convenient.</li>
    <li> Tried this 6 times for 20-30 minutes each time.  Barely noticeable.  Because it was so ineffective I ended up burning my mouth.  I brought it up to them &amp; they wrote back claiming it was professional grade.  Whatever, burn your gums for yourself if you don&#x27;t believe me.  I used it until I was foaming at the mouth, just plain did not work.  I aim to use up the entire tube since they won&#x27;t give my money back.</li>
    <li> This works,  I use it only once a week for a touch-up.  This is strong and I am not sensitive person.</li>
    <li> mouth piece, did not work... bleaching agent showed minimal results.  For the price, you get what you pay for. a</li>
    <li> dont buy this product, it started burning my gums right away. also you are paying way too much for a little bit of product.</li>
    <li> Love this for the money cannot be beat. I can&#x27;t afford in office visits and this does just the trick. I don&#x27;t use the trays and I have not had any sensitivity which I was concerned about with some of the reviews. I actually have pretty sensitive teeth to begin with.</li>
    <li> I think this works well, but you don&#x27;t need to use too much of it at a time AND be careful not to place any of it in your gums.  Ouch!!!</li>
    <li> just ok&lt;br /&gt;product whitened some not as good as i expected&lt;br /&gt;ok for the price of the product&lt;br /&gt;will not order again</li>
    <li> I did get speedy service, but after 5 days of continued use I showed no results.  I had to go to Wal-Mart and buy whitening strips and within 2 days my teeth were much improved.  The product, I concluded, was either weak or out of date.</li>
    <li> This seems to work fine, and is very convenient to use! It is also handy to squeeze out with the syringe.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used so many whiteners in the past, and nothing seems to last as long as I&#x27;d hope.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, they all cost around 30 dollars or more.&lt;br /&gt;When I started learning about Carbamide peroxide, I had to try it...and for only 10 dollars that couldn&#x27;t even hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Well, this product has surpassed my expectations- greatly. I only use a small amount at a time, and it works very well...and I still have some- so when I feel my teeth need to look a bit better I just apply some gel and wait about 30 minutes...and then my teeth are whiter again! I get so many compliments about how white my teeth are now and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I found it didn&#x27;t work any better than the product I currently use which is only 8% and only needs to be used for 15 minutes. The lasting period for the 44% stuff is only one day and it needs to be reapplied the same as the 8% stuff - which incidentally, comes with the teeth guards and in a 100ml bottle for about the same price....</li>
    <li> not real happy with this one forming the trays was a real chore and the stuff really burned my gums</li>
    <li> Happy with the product! I don&#x27;t use it as directed. I use it occasionally on my toothbrush and it keeps my teeth white to my liking. I don&#x27;t want unnatural white teeth so this works for me. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am a Registered dental assistant and have been exposed to many products in the field. This product is so high in percentage of Carbamide  Peroxide that it works very well. However if it is used improperly, it does have great potential for irritating the gums and for creating and/or exacerbating tooth sensitivity. This will not happen if you keep it off of the gums and only use it every other day or waiting even longer in between re-applications. I use it by extruding a very small dot on to a q-tip and applying it directly on to the tooth surfaces. When I do this I make sure to keep my lips in a wide smiling position as to not get it on the inside of my lips or gums. I did not boil the trays and keep them the way they came. The reason for this is because once I apply the gel to the teeth, I place the trays in and they help keep my lips away from the gel much better than if I had done the heat forming. I also place a bunched-up paper towel inside my mouth in between the top and bottom trays while the solution is on the teeth. This helps keep my saliva from spreading the gel around my mouth and from contacting other surfaces of gum and tissue. Sometimes I need to replace the paper towel if it becomes too saturated during the process. When I leave the trays the way they come, they seem to keep my lips at a farther distance from the teeth surfaces and don&#x27;t push the gel around and onto my gums. I have had some sensitivity but this is not abnormal when using whitening solutions at such high percentage of peroxide such as this product has. That being said, I LOVE the results. I saw a difference of at least 8 shades within 3 usages! That&#x27;s pretty good. I did have my teeth professionally whitened originally and I do notice in my 16 years as a registered dental assistant that it seems to speed up the touch up process when this is done at some time beforehand. If the stains on your teeth are due to natural pigment or from some sort of internal discoloration then it is very likely or at least possible that external whitening will not be successful. The price is so reasonable its definitely worth a try if you want to give it a go. I am totally pleased and happy with my results and with the product itself. It is what it says it is and for me, it does what it says it does! I use such a little amount it will last me months. I will likely store it in the fridge to ensure it&#x27;s efficacy for as long as possible. I say it&#x27;s a great product!&lt;br /&gt;TIP: When I am done applying the gel to the q-tip I pull back on the syringe plunger and it draws back any gel into the syringe barrel so that none is wasted. It will suck back into the syringe if you do this.ikely or at least possible that external whitening will not be successful.

    <li> To be honest this doesn&#x27;t really work. What I mean by that is that if you have an important event that&#x27;s the only time its good to use.... But your teeth don&#x27;t actually whiten. Its like a temp thing for maybe a couple of hours. I really was dissapointed with the product. But then again look at the price for what I got it for.</li>
    <li> Not whitening my teeth at all.. I&#x27;m very disappointed !!!  I demand something that works.. I&#x27;m getting my front teeth replaced with crowns next wk and I needed my real teeth as white as possible.  This stuff does nothing but burn my gums.  :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> easy to use.  had my own molds, didnt find anything irritating.  fast good results.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as my 70 percent stuff</li>
    <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Used it last night fo the first time, followed instrucitons from customer reviews worked great, am confident will work well and do equal to what I paid big buck for at the dentist.</li>
    <li> I will say it does do some kinda whitening but not what i expected it to do to my teeth.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. The trays make the gel go directly on your gums, which BURNS. It also bleached my gums temporarily, but my gums are still extremely sensitive now. I will not be using this gel ever again, and it was a complete waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I have done a couple of applications so far.  The last time I did it, it was quite irritating to my gums.  I guess that&#x27;s kind of expected but man did that freak me out.  So be careful when applying it.  I have noticed that my teeth is whiter than before I started using it so it did do its job.</li>
    <li> I have several types of teeth whitening gel that I use. Mostly 36% carbamide peroxide that I leave on my teeth for up to 45 minutes. I decided to try out the 44% to see what the difference was. When applied, you can feel it start to work immediately. It is a dull burning sensation. As with all carbamide peroxide gels, you have to be careful not to get it on your gums when applying it, and then wipe the gums down again when your trays are in place. This is even more true with this strong of a gel. If you accidentally get it on your gums, they will turn white and blister. With this gel, my teeth are whitened much faster. I have been able to leave the gel on my teeth for up to 20 minutes. I recommend starting with five minutes and working your way up to more time. If you are inexperienced at using carbamine peroxide, start with a lower percentage first. This will burn and leave your teeth feeling sensitive for a few days, but it definitely works fast and gives you better results.</li>
    <li> Item is working well, I feel an overal cleaner mouth, My gums are not so red anymore from gingivitis.</li>
    <li> I did 10 days straight of 20 minute applications and I saw a very nice improvement of several shades whiter.  I have fairly white teeth to begin with, and this was used as a touch up prior to my wedding.  No discomfort or sensitivity on the gums or teeth.  I have custom made trays, so I get minimal contact of gel on gums.  20 minutes was enough time to whiten while keeping tooth sensitivity at bay.  Product works best when whitening consistently.  Whiten everyday (don&#x27;t skip days) and whiten for at least a week straight for best results.</li>
    <li> Nice product that works, very painful on my gums. Even turned them white after about ten minutes, wouldn&#x27;t try again</li>
    <li> I had been using this product for over a week ever day and couldn&#x27;t see any difference, but now after about 2 weeks I am beginning to see a difference. So looks like it takes a bit patience and time.</li>
    <li> the trays are a joke compared to a dentist  but you get what you pay for.  if you never have whitened before  know what your doing. you can burn your gums.  dont cry about it lke the others. this is a strong product to do the job it works</li>
    <li> product is ok,I&#x27;ve applied little amount on my each teeth and it doesn&#x27;t hurts so.if the gel touches your gums,u&#x27;ll have white gums for a day at least.Trays are bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and can tell a huge difference in my teeth. I also received the package super fast! Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> If you can feel with a minut amount of teeth pain this product is great. It&#x27;s doing wonder s for my self esteem.</li>
    <li> had directions  worked very well&lt;br /&gt;  will order again when needed  i wll most definately recommend this product to other people.</li>
    <li> I have the trays in my mouth as we speak and i am loving this product so far. my one and only issue was i submerged the trays in hot water as it stated but they did not pick up an impression on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Worked well, results were seen after first use. The hardest part was boiling the water to make the trays fit. However, not for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything to whiten or brighten my teeth. I used for a month and noticed nothing different</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money, did not properly even after using all the gel there was no change but irritation.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this whitening product. And I ordered it for my whole family. It works really well. Just be careful if your teeth is very sensitive. Then this product is not for you. It works in 5-15 minutes. Be careful not to put it on your gums. This product will make your teeth several shades lighter depending how long you have it on. You will get immediate results the longer you put it on.</li>
    <li> I have been whitening my teeth for years.  My dentist made the molds and used Opalelscence, 33% carbamide peroxide.  Since this product offered 44% I thought I would give it a whirl.  Truthfully, I am not certain if it even works.  I see no difference.  The taste is horrible and my teeth look the same.  Will not purchase again and going back Opalescence.</li>
    <li> It was ok, not really what I wanted</li>
    <li> estoy muy contenta con mi compra, recomiendo al vendedor... el envio fue rapido y me enviaron exactamente lo que compre</li>
    <li> At first i thought that this product was not gonna work so after i ordered it i cancled it, but then i thought i should give it a try. When i received my product i tried it on the very first night and it didnt seem to do anything, but i thought i should give it a chance and leave it on for 30 minutes each night, snd to this day my teeth have been getting whiter with no irritation whats so ever, except for a tiny dot i got on my gum.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my teeth, and for the strength of peroxide, it is surprisingly mild if it comes in contact with my gums.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a friend, and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Burned holes in my teeth</li>
    <li> Item is ok but it doesnt whiten as well as said wouldnt buy it anymore and it isnt 20-30 applications</li>
    <li> This product is a great value for your money.after just one use you can see a difference.I paid a 75$ from the dentist office one year ago, I will never do that again.Try this you will love it!</li>
    <li> This product seems to work just as well as some of the big brands, costing double or triple the amount I paid for this. The tube is actually larger than it looks in the picture. The other reviews were right when mentioning the gum tenderness.....you only need it on 10-15 mins, not 30 mins-hour like some other treatments.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth much whiter then I expected (which is a good thing). I recommend this to anone who wants to whiten their teeth.</li>
    <li> came in an unmarked package with no labels or instructions....would not recommend using at it looks like someone just filled a syringe up wtih some gel and is selling it as teeth whitener.</li>
    <li> You can see why a dentist would normally use this -- if left too long on your gums, it can bleach and burn them. If you have professional trays, this is an excellent use for them.  Just keep it to 5-10 minutes.  And don&#x27;t even think about using it overnight. The results are as good as the $350-$750 charged by the pros. Although they&#x27;d make sure your teeth are clean and can benefit from this the best.  But if your teeth are clean, this is the way to go. If you&#x27;re currently using the 3-10 percent stuff overnight, stop.  Get this.  I got three types -- anything over 30 percent is great.  The best combination is a professional tray, professional cleaning and then dump the overnight 3-10 percent gel, and use this for 5-10 minutes instead.</li>
    <li> ok product for price I guess if you ised it daily or twice a day you would see better reults. it made a couple of spots on my teeth &amp; I know that it was evenly applied I also used a blue light I already had. this is no better than the teeth whitner I bought at the tanning salon that was cehaper</li>
    <li> This arrived within a week. However DenLaboratory is not on the packaging and the only thing I found online about the sender&#x27;s name was this empty wholesale profile, [...] . The tooth tray comes in a fitted plastic inside another envelope sized plastic that has the syringe. They are basic clear plastics with absolutely no labels or writing. Unfortunately, the plastic seemed years old and overly handled with scratches, prints, wrinkles and...either pen or teeth marks..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, it had an opening in which the syringe and tooth tray fit perfectly through.  The description said sealed but this seemed shoved through a recycled plastic. There is a crinkled , run over web page print out in the package of this order from the sellers account , a letter begging the buyer not to post less than 5 stars, and a ridiculous printed page of instructions in micro font with no logo header, margins, or proper indentations.</li>
    <li> I was expecting my gums to be sore like they are with Crest White Strips. This had an obvious baking soda taste to it and I left it on my teeth about 40 minutes. No noticeable gum tenderness, no noticeable change in tooth color with one application. I have teeth forms from the dentist and I had to use those because when I heated up the included mouth guard it curled up into a ball and was impossible to straighten out no matter how many times I re-dipped it. Also, it came in a small plastic sealed baggie. Kind of like someone made it at home and was just sending out &amp;#34;grandmas home recipe&amp;#34;. The gel is thick and cloudy and a little grainy.</li>
    <li> Lies they tell about this product please don&#x27;t waste your time if you want to buy this un professional wrapped product then be my guest but its a big waste that doesn&#x27;t even whiten your teeth...</li>
    <li> I read most of the reviews on this product but really had my doubts as to its effectiveness. I was extremely happy to see by the second treatment a difference in my teeth color. This product is easy to use and requires no extra time if you do it while showering and getting ready for your day (or evening).</li>
    <li> I just recieved my package tonight and it is very sketchy looking. Package came with small page of instructions with very little info. I also did not recieve an LED light to whiten then so no way I can use this now. Overall, not impressed. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had my teeth bleached several years ago and update them annually.  I did not see a big difference with this product.</li>
</ol>
