      <li>Best investment for a hair product!!!</li>
      <li>I use Unite 7 Seconds conditioner after I shower, then brush my hair, then use Moroccan Oil on my ends and this, and my hair is GORGEOUS!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent product to perk up curls.  </li>
      <li>, I say that Unite is a great brand and this beach texturizing spray is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Great product and will buy from seller again</li>
      <li>Totally worth the $!!!!</li>
      <li>Amazing amazing amazing... best beach wave product.</li>
      <li>And it smells good, too.</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>This does amazing things for fine hair!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the texture this stuff gives my hair.</li>
      <li>Love this product enhances my curls</li>
      <li>May get more ideas from that.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Unite Beach Spray works ok....</li>
      <li>I prefer \\&quot;Not Your Mother&#x27;s Beach Spray\\&quot; which has a more tropical scent.</li>
      <li>My hair is perfect everytime, and after years of straightening my hair with keratin treatments and my flat iron which took hours because of my massive amount of wavy/ curly 2C/ 3A hair, which is color treated, I now spend 5 minutes after jumping out of the shower and my hair is Giselle perfect everytime!!</li>
      <li>It seemed as though the bottle was filled with scented water.  </li>
      <li>LOVED the product UNITE that they used but couldn&#x27;t purchase it there because of my carry on only bag.</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>but again, the other beach spray is cheaper, smells better and works better on my hair.</li>
      <li>I can style it straight or, miraculously, it&#x27;ll get full and curly if I have the right product.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product.</li>
      <li>LOVE it and the 7 second detangler too.</li>
      <li>My friends tease me about trying so many different hair products</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products in this line and really liked them.</li>
      <li>Got my hair short and choppy and since have been trying to find a great beach spray that comes close to what was used on me at the time of my cut.</li>
      <li>Not really any better than any others.  </li>
      <li>Saves me so much time; just spray, scrunch curls</li>
      <li>Smells like an old lady smell, I  love old ladies but have no other words to describe it.  </li>
      <li>This is the right product; I can depend on it for a head full of the loose and breezy curls.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products in my day and spent a lot of money on items that just made my hair flat (because it&#x27;s so fine)and not the full, curly look I like.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday and just love the results.</li>
      <li>I then do a few \\&quot;twirls\\&quot; with my fingers at the crown and top of head.</li>
      <li>The results are very natural, not stiff or sticky.</li>
      <li>I expected it to be more like the Bumble and Bumble Surf spray and less like hair spray.</li>

<li> I have thick, fine-ish, medium-shortish hair.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed in Unite Beach Spray.</li>

    <li> Not really any better than any others.  Just $$$$</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in Unite Beach Spray. I&#x27;ve tried other products in this line and really liked them. The Beach Spray has an odd smell--kind of beachy. I prefer \\&quot;Not Your Mother&#x27;s Beach Spray\\&quot; which has a more tropical scent. Unite Beach Spray works ok....but again, the other beach spray is cheaper, smells better and works better on my hair.</li>
    <li> Once opened the pump bottle did not work so I cannot put it properly on my hair. Would like to see how it works especially for the money it cost!</li>
    <li> I got my haircut on vacation at Nine Zero One salon in West Hollywood. LOVED the product UNITE that they used but couldn&#x27;t purchase it there because of my carry on only bag. LOVE this product. Got my hair short and choppy and since have been trying to find a great beach spray that comes close to what was used on me at the time of my cut. LOVE it and the 7 second detangler too. Will def buy the shampoo/conditioner next!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. It dryed out my hair.</li>
    <li> Best curl cream around!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the texture this stuff gives my hair.</li>
    <li> This does amazing things for fine hair!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product. I am doing so because it has solved my problem. I have thick, fine-ish, medium-shortish hair. I can style it straight or, miraculously, it&#x27;ll get full and curly if I have the right product. This is the right product; I can depend on it for a head full of the loose and breezy curls.I spray quite a bit in my hair, down to the roots. I then do a few \\&quot;twirls\\&quot; with my fingers at the crown and top of head. Lastly, I put in clips at the roots (while it dries)for the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; at the crown.I let it air dry, run my fingers through it when it&#x27;s dry to toss into a casual look. No hair spray. Amazing. I&#x27;ve tried many products in my day and spent a lot of money on items that just made my hair flat (because it&#x27;s so fine)and not the full, curly look I like. And it smells good, too. And I typically don&#x27;t like perfumed products. It is definitely worth a try. I get A LOT of compliments. I haven&#x27;t looked at the uTube video about how to use it. May get more ideas from that.</li>
    <li> Great product and will buy from seller again</li>
    <li> Very stiff and crunchy. I expected it to be more like the Bumble and Bumble Surf spray and less like hair spray.</li>
    <li> It seemed as though the bottle was filled with scented water.  There was no texture to the product whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to perk up curls.  Saves me so much time; just spray, scrunch curls and I&#x27;m out the door!!!!  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product enhances my curls</li>
    <li> Gives your hair extra volume</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing amazing... best beach wave product. My hair is perfect everytime, and after years of straightening my hair with keratin treatments and my flat iron which took hours because of my massive amount of wavy/ curly 2C/ 3A hair, which is color treated, I now spend 5 minutes after jumping out of the shower and my hair is Giselle perfect everytime!! Best investment for a hair product!!! I use Unite 7 Seconds conditioner after I shower, then brush my hair, then use Moroccan Oil on my ends and this, and my hair is GORGEOUS!!! I only wash my hair every 4 or 5 days, but I wet it every day and reapply and my hair never gets greasy either! Totally worth the $!!!!</li>
    <li> Smells like an old lady smell, I  love old ladies but have no other words to describe it.  Like the smell of vintage dep gel maybe?</li>
    <li> Would give 5 stars except for the cost. The results are very natural, not stiff or sticky. It takes a lot of product to do the job and requires reapplication after wind or a hat.</li>
    <li> My friends tease me about trying so many different hair products and it&#x27;s with this experience, I say that Unite is a great brand and this beach texturizing spray is wonderful. I use it everyday and just love the results.</li>
