<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have always had weak nails that broke . I would also get cracks below the tip of the nail which would need to be trimmed, resulting in a very short nail. Since I started using this product in March 2013, I have not had a single nail break. I do get the occasional roughness on the tips. But, this is easily filed. For the first time ever, I have the nails I always wanted. I do not know how the newer formula works. I can only speak about the ORIGINAL formula, which I highly recommend. I will never use any other nail strengthener now that I have found this super product. Thank you, OPI !!!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (July 2013): Finally, after using this product for 4 months, I had a nail break. But, it broke in such a minor way that I was able to file it. I still consider this product A+ as, before I started using it, I would have broken practically every nail in a four month period. I actually had to file down all my nails as they were getting too long. I just bought my second bottle and still highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have never had such excellent service.  The product was delivered in two days from the time I ordered it.  My nails are brittle.  They break easily and this product really does help.  The price I paid was better than retail locally.</li>
    <li> I pay about $16 or $17 dollars for this stuff in the stores. So, the online price is fantastic. This is a staple product for me. It works. It does what it says. After I&#x27;ve finished the bottle, I can go about a month or two without it. Typically, I might apply the second bottle only once per week or so, giving my nails little breaks in between before repeating the process. OPI makes a follow up treatment for this product, used for maintenance, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet since it&#x27;s harder to find in my area. I know the price seems a little expensive to some, but, for me, it&#x27;s worth every penny.   I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years. After you&#x27;ve stopped using this product for 2 months or so, your nails go back to normal. I&#x27;ve always had long nails, but after my second pregnancy my nails would break very easily. I tried gel overlays over my natural nails for awhile, but that process actually destroyed my natural nails. I cut them off, let them grow out, and have been using Nail Envy ever since.  Nail Envy seems to make the nail a bit thicker. I still break nails from time to time (especially if they&#x27;re getting TOO long), but no where near as often as I do without this product.   A hair stylist recommended that I forget about the gel and try this product. I had very little hope that it measured up to all the hype, but (obviously) I was pleasantly surprised. Nail Envy does not work instantly. When you&#x27;re just starting out (or starting over) with Nail Envy, you  have to use this product as directed for at least 2 weeks before you see a difference. I have recommended this product to other people who did not follow the instructions, and they did not get the results. For the first week and a half or so, your nails may still break and do whatever it is that they typically do. Just give it time. Use as directed, and you will be very happy with the results! (Be *sure* to cut/file/buff out any splits in your nails. Nail Envy will not repair or mend damage that has already occurred to the nail.)</li>
    <li> Face it - if you can&#x27;t build a set of nails with ENVY, you probably aren&#x27;t intended to wear nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this ten years ago and paid full-price.  When I found it here, on Amazon, all my troubles faded to black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes - I admit - I stray from this terrific product and return to \\&quot;Hard as Nails\\&quot; - trying to fool myself into ignorant complacency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then - my nails grow.  And I begin to suffer again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it up with ENVY, girls - and you&#x27;ll never be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be the one everyone else envies.</li>
    <li> I got great service.  Shipped product quickly and I got exactly what I wanted.  Also, got it for a great price.  Would recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and have always been pleased with the results.  The price was fantastic and I received the product almost immediately (ordered on Fri, received on Mon.) I will definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived fast but I was charged $5.95 for shipping and both nailpolishes arrived in the same shipment.  I felt a little jipped</li>
    <li> I was at Target and found this product for $16.  I love this stuff.  If I take biotin vitamins and use I can actually get my nails to grow!  Xpressyourself is a great company to buy from.  One of my products didn&#x27;t match colors and  they sent a refund immediately!</li>
    <li> At one of my jobs I take care of pools and am constantly washing the chlorinated water and other chemicals off of my hands. At the other I touch money and cardboard and dust and lots of other things so my hands and nails get dry and worn fast. This product made my nails look better even on the first day. It looks better than any other clear nail product. After a few weeks my nails look healthy and strong and better then they ever did before I abused them. Great product if you ask me! I can&#x27;t stop looking down at my nails.</li>
    <li> As a nurse, washing and washing my hands, I have never been able to have decent fingernails. Now, after using Nail Envy for 2 weeks, I am seeing stronger nails. No more peeling or tearing from the edges. Do not use if you have torn cuticles or hang nails. It burns. Get them healed up then apply as directed. Used 2 weeks and can the bottle still appears quite full, so it looks like it will last a while.</li>
    <li> This is easy and quick to use, dries within a minute..helps my nails stay strong while in water all the time. can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> I have used Nail Envy for years and am very well pleased with it. It keeps my nails from splitting and peeling.  Also, helps them to grow.</li>
    <li> I definitely love the brand Opi but this product did not work well for me.  I have extremely thin and peeling nails so it is very hard to find an item that does produce good results. This particular nail strengthener works just as well if not better than other brands I have tried.</li>
    <li> Nail Envy works great as both a base coat and top coat, and even looks good on your nails all by itself with no color on top. I have definitely noticed that my nails are stronger after using it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with Nail Envy.  I had artificial nails removed and my nails were very weak and were starting to peel.  Applying Nail Envy really helped strengthen them and they are beginning to look attractive.  I still have a way to go but it was a worthwhile and satisfying purchase.</li>
    <li> I am turning 40 and I finally decided that pretty nails are something I want. After watching a youtube video by a woman who has amazing nails and sort of dismissing out of hand that she is just genetically blessed, I decided to google \\&quot;Nail Strengthener.\\&quot; I had never heard of Nail Envy but it showed up and my local beauty supply store had it in stock. I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to wait for it...imagine my shock when they charged me $17! Well, it was a splurge on myself, something I rarely do and they have a satisfaction-guaranteed policy so sign me up! That was two months ago. I don&#x27;t understand the reviews by the people who say they saw results in a week...hmmmm...but I can say after two months, I have dramatically stronger nails. My nails are normally bendy and they peel terribly. I did buy a much cheaper strengthener at the same beauty supply store that the clerk recommended to me as another option that was only $5. Well, the difference after two months and two empty bottles is clear. Nail Envy works. I used it on my right hand as those nails get more abuse and there is a visible difference! They feel thicker and there is no peeling whatsoever. And no bending! I really love this stuff and will order my next bottle on Amazon! Try it! Give it a few months to really see the difference. I didn&#x27;t even make sure to put it on every other day, there were times when I just forgot and even so it worked! Just try it, you deserve it!!!</li>
    <li> I have never EVER had to think about clipping my nails! I am a 59 y/o woman and my nails have ALWAYS been soft and \\&quot;peely\\&quot;. I am a dental hygienist so my hands are constantly in water and latex gloves. Nail envy is the first product I have used on my nails that stays on even with the constant moisture and gloves. Now my biggest problem is that I have to make time every week to clip them so my patients dont start hating me!No longer use it every other day - maybe 2-3 times a week so a little goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> loved that they shipped it so fast and the price was so good really worth my money thank u :]</li>
    <li> I have very weak nails and they peel all the time so when I learned about this product I decided to give it a try. What a diference it makes. Before I apply nai polish, I use this as a base coat.  This is great to keep my nails strong for a week. Just make sure you use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is, without doubt, the best nail strengthener I have used. Results were almost immediate. Love OPI products, always give great results.</li>
    <li> My nail were able to grow out some but the strength of them wasn&#x27;t really enough to keep them long. They would bend and brake. Just not as fast as usually. It is kinda annoying have to apply it so much.</li>
    <li> This is buy far one of the best Nail Strengtheners I have found yet! It works great!</li>
    <li> My nails are pretty soft as I have my hands in water frequently throughout the day and I also garden which gets rough on my nails. I was considering getting fake nails but am adverse to the whole process. Decided to give this product a try and am very pleased with the support it gives my nails. I have been using it as they suggest and my nails are actually growing longer!</li>
    <li> I am an avid OPI user and nail envy is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used to correct and keep up ones nails.  I have been having trouble with mine peeling and this product has put a stop to that problem.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this could possibly be the actual O.P.I stuff I was looking for, but it was cheap enough to take a chance.  It&#x27;s legit!  Thanks for the great deal!</li>
    <li> My nails are damaged from acrylics and this is the best SO far that I&#x27;ve found...plus this supplier is one of the BEST I&#x27;ve used from Amazon!!  Products are as described and packaged with bubble wrap VERY well.</li>
    <li> This polish is absolutly,wonderful, from the first day you use it you will notice a difference in your nails, it doesnt chip, My nails have all grown out evenly,no breakage. I had to order more for my friends. I love this polish</li>
    <li> This product is well worth it.  With dedicated use, anyone can grow strong nails.  I apply several coats over the course of a day or two before adding color, or I use it alone.  The key is to apply several coats and you will feel your nails growing stronger and they will be well protected.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The liquid appears as if it was going to be a mat finish but it shines like regular clear polish. I was hoping it would be more like a hardening gel but if you you put about three coats on it does a decent job AND it doesn&#x27;t peel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years introduced to me by my manicurist . Have had beautiful nails ever since. I would recommend this product to anyone. A long with this product I suggest you also order nail oil by OPI for healthy cuticles and nails.Buff oil into nails and cuticles. You&#x27;ll be amazed at the difference in your nails in about two weeks</li>
    <li> I liked it so well I ordered another for a friend who wanted one.  It has helped my nails quite a bit.</li>
    <li> OPI&#x27;s Nail Envy is a remarkable product!  It is designed to help correct dry, brittle nails and even after just two weeks, you can see the results.  The original formula dries to a nice gloss, the Matte finish dries to a non-gloss finish.  OPI points out that the non-gloss finish was designed specially for men who do not care for a glossy finish on their nails.  You can combine it with a light translucent white or beige to help correct the discoloration of yellow or stained nails.  I have found that it works very well on toenails since they tend to get abused or neglected in the months shoes are worn most of the time.  Look for the \\&quot;His &#x27;N Hers\\&quot; package that combines one bottle of each type at a slightly discounted price.  Your gal will love it too!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. The nail polish chips before its time to reapply it. I wish it was thinner like an oil treatment that can soak in your nails instead of keep changing it</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I thought the nail strengthener would be more effective. I will keep using it hoping that by the time the bottle is finished I will have a better result.</li>
    <li> Love this nail strengthener. My nails which are soft and brittle thrive when I use this product. I have tried the other opi nail strengtheners without success. Theis is the bomb!!</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and I have found this to be the best nail hardener I have tried! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Around the first of the year I decided to try and make my hands look more feminine. In my profession I must wash my hands sometimes 50-60 times a day, so it is difficult to wear polish, fake nails against policy and rings often get washed away. So I thought maybe if could grow my nails a bit my hands would look more attractive. After some internet research this product kept coming up. As I am a cheapskate, it was hard to part with the expensive price as there were other products costing half the money. It took about six weeks but man did my hands look good!  I have been a walking advertisement for this stuff. So many people have complimented me on my nails, they are long clean and shiny. All my friends are now using this and I am on my second bottle.  It lasts a long time so it is actually not expensive in the long run. I would not consider any other nail hardener. Plus I found it for considerably less on Amazon, I now buy things i would never would have thought of on Amazon! Love to save money!!</li>
    <li> This polish has worked and done its job.  My nails used to be short and weak.  My nails are stronger and have grown longer.</li>
    <li> I have very very thin nails.  I had to remove my gel nails because apparently I am allergic to the chemical.  My nails were very weak when I started using this product and I did break one nail in the first week of use.  It has been a few weeks now and I have not broken a nail and they feel naturally stronger.  I have never been able to grow my nails without using some type of acrylic until now.  Worth the money and follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> I have been using OPI Original Nail Envy for about 12 years now. Can&#x27;t live without it!! The reason I bought it from Amazon this time was the \\&quot;AMAZING PRICE\\&quot;. This costs me $20 (plus tax) at my local salon!! I couldn&#x27;t believe the price when I checked Amazon - thought maybe something would be wrong with the polish, but it&#x27;s excellent!! I will buy it here from now on and I just hope Amazon keeps selling it. I used to have very brittle nails that would peel, chip and break easily. Not anymore!! This product is great!! I get so many compliments on my nails. Love it!!</li>
    <li> There is no substitute for nail envy... I&#x27;ve used it for years and Amazon has the best price (of course)!</li>
    <li> i have been looking for this nail strengthener for a long time. This is really a great product. It helps my nails to stay strong and nor so easily broken. Thx!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as a nail strengthener, but then saw a youtube video showing how to use it as a base, and never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my nail polish to last over a week at a time (putting top coat after the polish as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!  I would highly recommend it especially to those who have peeling and weak nails.  It does help.</li>
    <li> Nail Envy has made a remarkable difference to my nails.  I had problems with constant peeling and had to keep filing or clipping them because of it.  Every time I use this product, people comment on how awesome my nails look.  They are long and strong and now I have to file them only for maintenance and to keep the length manageable!  I have used this product on and off for years and always have great results.  My only complaint is that when I get down to about the last third of the bottle, it gets so thick that it is unusable.  Other than that, I love it!</li>
    <li> With continued use of this product, I am now able to have longer and stronger nails -- and nails that do not break as often.  Will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> My nails are much stronger now.  I would highly recommend this product.  Prevents splitting and chipping.  Works better than any other product</li>
    <li> This is great stuff - stays on and helps with soft nails immediately! My nails are already much stronger and the cuticle oil is great also! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the very best nail strengthner that I have ever used. I use as a base coat and also as a topcoat.</li>
    <li> The salon size brush and the quality of the product are amazingly better than any polish I have ever used. It stays on until you take it off.  It looks natural and clean.</li>
    <li> This works far better than I expected.  It not only seems to strengthen your nails, but  if you top it up over your polish, your colour stays on twice as long.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I have the weakest nails.  They always split and tear.  I&#x27;ve tried everything.  Nothing really worked very well.  A friend suggested Nail Envy and so I tried it and I can say this is the best product for weak splitting nails.  Love it. [[ASIN:B000ORNKHY OPI Original Nail Envy Nail Strengthener]]</li>
