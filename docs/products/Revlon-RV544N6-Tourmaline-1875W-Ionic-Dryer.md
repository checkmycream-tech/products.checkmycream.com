<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used it for about 6 months and loved it, no complaints.  Then it just stopped working.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. While I read that some people had problems with this hair dryer, I had purchased it before, and that one lasted 4 1/2 years. Considering the price, and the fact that I returned one (to a drug store, not to Amazon) that cost more than twice the price and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well, I decided to take my chances. It dries hair quickly without breakage. I did notice that now on the info they include, it tells you not to wrap the cord around the handle for storage. I always did that, although I never pulled it tight to where it broke the wires or covering on them, so maybe that contributed to the problem people have had? Seems to be well made. I will update this review if it breaks quickly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy! After using it for a little over 6 months mine suddenly caught on fire.&lt;br /&gt;It stopped working, sparkles came out of the handle, the electric cord caught on fire. I was able to unplug it.&lt;br /&gt;The sparkles damaged my wall bathroom mirror. But at least I didn&#x27;t die from electrocution!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer several times, and it is faster and quieter than my previous (deceased) hair dryer. My hair gets dryer faster, plus the Revlon dryer is very light, making it so easy to use without straining my arms for so long. I haven&#x27;t used attachments on a blow dryer in so long, I almost forgot what a convenience they are. In truth, I tossed out my old dryer&#x27;s attachments because they kept popping off while the dryer was working. No such problem here -- the attachments seem to snap securely into place and stay there until they are removed! Excellent price for a dryer that performs this well. I may ultimately purchase a second one for the guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> I liked this Revlon hair dryer as it dried my hair quickly and was relatively lightweight.  I&#x27;m on my third one though within a year.  It only takes my hair 5 minutes to blow dry, once daily.  This hair dryer should last much longer.  I&#x27;m on my search for another dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great and cheap. I don&#x27;t use one all the time but when I do I expect it to make my hair dry and not hot. This dryer does not damage my hair and it&#x27;s still in great shape. My only concern is it smells pretty bad like something is burnt when I turn it on but it doesn&#x27;t bother me because I understand it has to heat up.</li>
    <li> It is not terrible but I would not buy it again.  It seems like over time ( and not a long time) the dryer has lost some of its air power.  I thought it used to actually move my hair while I was drying it now it does not.  It blows two temperatures of hot air and the cold shot still works, I have cleaned the filters out but it just takes forever to dry my med length hair.  I want a blow dryer that BLOWS the hair.  This one does not.  The other issue I have is with the design.  The toggle switch power is right where you hold the dryer so I am CONSTANTLY turning it off accidentally while drying.</li>
    <li> I have been using the hairdryer for a while and everything had been working fine. Yesterday however, after blow drying for about 5 minutes, I noticed it started to lose power. I thought I simply had to clean the filter, but before I managed to reach up and turn it off there were sparks and smoke coming out from both the outlet and blow dryer itself. As this was right where I held my hand, I dropped it in panic and unplugged it immediately. In the split second that the dryer ignited, the palm of my hand had turned black from the smoke. Most of this washed away, but I was left with a painful burn that has yet to go away. Upon closer inspection I noticed that the cable had broken where it connects to the dryer, and reading other reviews this seems to be a common problem. I have never bent the wire at this point, as I consistently hang it using the attached hook. This must simply be bad engineering, and seeing how this could be dangerous (even potentially lethal), I cannot recommend this hair dryer to anyone else.</li>
    <li> Needed a new hair dryer.  Read many reviews for this dryer and I have to agree with the positive reviews.  This hair dryer is very impressive.</li>
    <li> Awesome blow dryer, I wish I had chosen the travel one. Next time. It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing to hate about this hair dyer. I&#x27;ve owned mine for two years and I use it most of the time and it still functions the way it did when I first bought it. I really cannot ask for anything more. If ever it breaks, of course it would in the future, I would buy the same kind.</li>
    <li> I liked this hairdryer and have used it for 1 year 2 months when suddenly while using, sparks shot out of the cord/dryer junction (burning my wrist) and proceeded to burn like a candle until unplugged. I was happy with the performance, but with a safety issue like that I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice while it lasted.  I only had this dryer for about a year when the motor started going out.  I use the dryer maybe once or twice a week and feel the dryer should have lasted years.  I will not buy this dryer again.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works amazingly well. A great purchase made and not a bad price either!</li>
    <li> Got it a year and one month ago. Have been using it about twice a week. I liked it, it was powerful enough, light weight and easy to use. But it stopped working yesterday. I am a little disappointed as I would expect a hair dryer to last me at least 2-3 years, especially a brand like Revlon.</li>
    <li> Like my to friendly neighbor; plenty of hot air.</li>
    <li> This dryer works great. It drys my hair quickly &amp; leaves my hair looking healthy &amp; silky.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Arrived quickly and in perfect mint condition. Best Hairdryer I have owned thus far.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after using it for 5 months. Sparkles came out of the handle, the electric cord burned, very scary experience. Wonder if there&#x27;s a warranty period.</li>
    <li> Love it. Dries my hair without the frizz</li>
    <li> great size and the defuser is great too</li>
    <li> Very Quiet and very efficient!!</li>
    <li> No complaints and still holding up. Thanks Revlon!</li>
    <li> Works like it should, looks great, works great. Heats up quickly, and never gets hot to the touch.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lightweight hairdryer as some are quite heavy.  This is sold as lightweight and compared to other hair dryers it is,  but I wish it was a little bit lighter.  That being said, I like the cold shot, the high and low speeds, and high and low heat.  It is also fairly quiet.</li>
    <li> Very quiet and works great!</li>
    <li> Blows your mind! Haha</li>
    <li> I really love this hair dryer.  It does a great job, no frizz, and pretty light weight for the size.  Only issue is the switches are located in a spot that makes me hit them and turn it off by accident all the time.</li>
    <li> Broke before the one year mark...the cord opened and started on fire</li>
    <li> Previously owned same model and make. Was very upset when it died on me so I was determined to find the same dryer. Love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Love! Love! Love! I&#x27;ve always had trouble trying to blow dry my hair like the professionals do. This dryer is quick and gets very hot, USE HEAT PROTECTANT SPRAY. My hair came out almost like when the hair dressers do it, only fault was of my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this dryer to woman who has also had issues with frizzy hair when blow drying. It even comes with the concentrator and diffuser.</li>
    <li> Works just fine and it is not too noisy, best in price according to consumer reports.</li>
    <li> Unit has a nice grib to hold but I do not like that every once in a while I turn the unit off while drying my hair,  The buttons at the bottom of the handle are too close to the grip.  Other than that I like that you can do a cool boost and have two different speeds and it is light in weight,  would recomment</li>
    <li> Ridiculously lightweight and small compared to the hair dryer it replaced. Significantly more powerful. I thank myself for this purchase everyday, everything you want in a hairdryer.</li>
    <li> I needed a new dryer after my old one died out (a cheap conair) and this one is the perfect replacement. It&#x27;s a little loud, but it works quickly enough and my hair dries in no time!</li>
    <li> Quiet, lightweight and dries fast. Very pleased with this purchase, especially for all of that and a great price too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one or what. Had this less then 6 months. It started shooting sparks. Almost burned my daughter. It was not dirty, the filter was not full. It just shot Sparks and died. No pictures because I&#x27;m never plugging the piece of crap in again. And no my house is not old. The wiring is not old. And was not stored in the bathroom. It was stored in a caddy in the linen closet.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed! Bought this 01/26th and by 04/14th it stopped working! Not sure what happened. Just stopped.</li>
    <li> This dries my hair so quickly! Way better than the old revlon dryer I had. I would purchase this hair dryer again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great and like the features it has.</li>
    <li> My hair got stuck in the back of the dryer (in the fan) as I was blow drying someone else&#x27;s hair!! My hair falls just below my boobs so it&#x27;s not some abnormal length. Suddenly I realize that my hair is stuck and I can&#x27;t pull it out! I had to cut a chunk of it off! The opening, where the fan is, is WAY too big and doesn&#x27;t do a good job at blocking things out of the fan!</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer that I have ever owned! I have curly hair and my children have straight hair, when we use this hairdryer on the kids hair, their hair is so shiny and healthy looking and it dries really fast. My hair, is a lot less frizzy when I use this dryer. Since I have curly hair, I use the large round diffuser and it works great for me! About to have to order a second one of these hairdryers, b/c the teenager keeps taking this one, it dries her hair so much faster then the other hairdryers around here and her hair looks a lot thicker and healthier when she uses this dryer.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS DRYER...ALMOST BLEW UP AND BURNED MY FACE OFF!!!! BURNED MY HAND!!! The plastic on the wire melted and the wire exposed. Never bent or fold the wires and used it very carefully. Not noticing the plastic melted...turned it on used it as usual to dry my hair...sparks started flying everywhere and burned my hand!!! So close to burning my face!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like more blow strength, but seems to dry efficiently despite!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this did not even last one year before it stopped working. And I don&#x27;t even blow dry my hair that often, maybe once a week? The rest of the time, I just let it dry naturally. This is one of the cheaper blow dryers.I bought it because I figured, since I use it so seldom, it will be good enough. I guess you get what you paid for. Not impressed by this product at all.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer! Works very well and the diffuser attachment fits snugly on the end and does not come off, like other dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> This dryer is powerful and heats up well which makes drying much quicker.  It has a lower setting if it is too hot for you.  It is also very light weight and very comfortable to hold.  I dry my hair every day with a round brush, this helps speed up the process and makes it easy.  They last 2 years plus and I have two now so that I have a back up when the other goes out.</li>
    <li> We bought this in Nov. 2013 and it is now broken. The plastic fan blades developed cracks and started to rattle at high speed. My wife and I each use it once a day and her long hair requires longer drying time and more agitation of the dryer. In the end, I wish we could get a few years for the $20 investment.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. HOWEVER, it died on me after a year like other reviewers noted. But it really doesn&#x27;t damage your hair and it dries your hair quickly. I have thick, curly hair and this has been a godsend. I tried to replace it with a different brand and after 3 months, I&#x27;ve given up on that one. The heat isn&#x27;t funneled well and my hair seems to have been damaged by the type of heat (not all ionic ceramic blowdryers are made the same). So, I broke down and just bought another one of these. So, yes, this is my second one in a year or two.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than my last dryer it comes with 2 attachments couple of heat settings and a cold shot. Good basic hairdryer. I would recomend this dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer, but after 1 year, it kept shorting out, so I returned it to the manufacturer (it has a 2-year warranty), and a week later I received a new one.</li>
    <li> Great deal, works great. Owned for 6 months now and no issues.</li>
    <li> Product arrived timely and as described, but not as powerful as I wanted.</li>
    <li> It does an excellent job in drying your hair.  My daughter and I have long hair &amp; it only took 10 minutes, very fast compared to several dryers i have bought in the past. I&#x27;m very impressed at how light it is but very powerful. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Working fine. Didn&#x27;t observe any issues</li>
    <li> my hair  is so much softer and shinny with this dryer. It drys my long hair unbelievably fast on low heat.</li>
    <li> I have pretty weak arms so this ultra lightweight thing is just the best for me. My hair gets dry quite fast and this is a plus since I am a young professional and I cannot be tardy. This is a good product considering its price.</li>
    <li> It does not &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; your hair, it is very lightweight. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer and its accoumpanying parts are great and just what I needed.  I have no complaints and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> All my hair dryers up to now have lasted at least 3-4 years, with daily use. This one conked out after only 1 year. Highly disappointing.</li>
    <li> well it started out great but almost exactly one year after i purchased the hair dryer it started making buzzing noises and smelling like something was burning.  I was always good about cleaning the back filter so it must be a defect with the dryer.  Its a cheap dryer so im not that upset just annoying to have to get a new one only after a year.  oh well,  On to the next one.</li>
    <li> I got this Dryer on February 3rd, 2013.  I usually used it every other day, sometimes daily.  The low speed stopped working by the end of March.  On June 18th, 2013, the dryer sparked, and stopped working all together.  I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer last less than a year.  This was wasted money.  I&#x27;ll be investing in a more expensive dryer this time.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this hair dryer - on my Asian thick hair, it dries it fast and makes brushing out (when needed) easy. Just make sure to use heat-protectant on your hair first - it does get very hot!</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair dryer for exactly five months... that is until a couple days ago when it started shooting sparks out the bottom right where the cable connects to the base. Great hair dryer but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
    <li> a pretty good deal for this price. quiet, doesn&#x27;t feel burnt but dry fast</li>
    <li> I bought this exact blow dryer from Amazon on 2-18-2013. It blew sparks out of the bottom where the cord connect. This happened November 2014. It only lasted maybe 1.5 years. I&#x27;ve had blow dryers for years with no problems. This one left a black streak on me and my sink due to the sparks/fire from the wire. I didn&#x27;t  even use this blow dryer every day. Several days a week I leave the house with wet hair because I ran out of time. Bad product!</li>
    <li> Works well so far.  Was advertised as being quiet but it definitely is not.</li>
    <li> I would give this hair dryer 10 stars if I could. Dries my thick unruly hair in 5 minutes at the highest setting.</li>
    <li> This dryer works very well-fast, light, and makes hair soft.  It&#x27;s not any quieter than my previous dryer, but because I can dry my hair much faster, I don&#x27;t have to listen to it as long.  The &#x27;tourmaline ionic&#x27; part makes a big difference to the softness of my hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome blow dryer.  I use it on my beard and the adjustable heat is great.  No more baking your hair, just use the lower heat setting, and the directional tip is great.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer! Wife was skeptical of the price bc she paid $100+ for the last one... This one didn&#x27;t disappoint! Dries her hair just as quickly as the high end one, ye didn&#x27;t cost me my second child!</li>
    <li> Dries very well but the coating on the casing gets sticky and rubs off.  I have thin to normal hair and it may be too hot for thin hair because although the box advertises no friz, I am still getting some friz or it may be damaging my hair due to the hot heat.  I will update when I am more sure of this.  I was hoping for relaxed silky results, but have not had the pleasure as yet.  Again, this may not be the best dryer for thin to normal hair.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve purchased - one for each of my daughters.  They are really nice hairdryers and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Worked well for a while but then just died. Not durable at all.</li>
    <li> This is such a great hair dryer. It&#x27;s worth the little money you pay for it and the quality is wonderful. My hair is a lot softer and healthier since moving over to this dryer! Not to mention it&#x27;s a bit more quiet than most hair dryers I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> We loved it to begin with. It was quiet and dried our hair quickly bu the then the dryer stopped working after 9 months.....something with the wires.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer.  Nothing but good things to say.  No negatives at all.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, so easy to use. It dries beautifully, leaving my hair shiny and smooth. Would definitely recommend, especially for the price</li>
    <li> I use this when I am so inclined for my hair. Great quality. Bought it again for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I love it how my hair quickly dries without the frizziness, it&#x27;s so light too! It gives shine to my hair. The heat can be adjusted to hot or warm, so you won&#x27;t incur damage to your hair. I have a few hairdryers in the past and this one is the best I got for a looong time!</li>
    <li> This product is worth the money. It dries hair quickly, it&#x27;s light weight, and it&#x27;s always nice to have a diffuser.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer. It&#x27;s affordable and works great! I have long, very thick, semi-straight hair and this is able to dry my hair in about 3 minutes. I debated purchasing a more expensive model for the guarantee of better quality (of course that&#x27;s not always the case), but from my research, this model is just as high-powered and well-reviewed as the more expensive brands. I find that for straight hair, you can save on the dryer but splurge on a good-quality straightener. Likewise you should save on the shampoo (it&#x27;s all basically the same ingredients) but splurge on a good conditioner. I&#x27;ve found that this makes all the difference for getting smooth, straight hair.</li>
    <li> I have had a Conair dryer for many years but it finally broke. After reading many reviews I chose the Revlon Tourmaline dryer. It really does dry my hair in half the time, and it looks extra shiny.</li>
    <li> This large handheld hair dryer is loud and takes a little too long to dry hair. I&#x27;ve had smaller ones that were more powerful and less noisy, but went for it because it looked like a bargain. If the diffuser attachment is important to you, that could cinch the deal. I found the attachment to be entirely ineffective, but it might work if you drape really long hair onto it.     Ionic - this product is marketed as ionic. It has an ion indicator light. The Revlon website doesn&#x27;t list this product, and I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere a claim to the effect that it imparts a negative charge to the air. It&#x27;s reasonable to expect Revlon to state whether it has an emitter and leaves only negative ions in the exhaust.     Unfortunately, quality handheld hair dryers cost a lot more. You have to look at this as a value purchase, and because it&#x27;s so large, you should have the space for it.</li>
    <li> I torched my other Ionic while traveling overseas. This was a great replacement for it. Works well, and I like the low setting the best. Just enough to allow me to dry my hair enough to go outside and not let the wind have it&#x27;s way with my hair :-)</li>
    <li> my hair is shoulder length, layered and medium thick.  My old dryer (Remington D-2012 Tstudio Collection Tourmaline and Ceramic Hair Dryer) took 5-10 minutes to dry my hair.  This dryer took 5-7.  But it overheated almost immediately and shut itself off.  and it took a few minutes to cool so I could turn it back on and finish drying.  There are no vents in the concentrator, either.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it&#x27;s light,but it feels flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cord is incredibly short.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this two days ago, used it just this morning and I am returning it.</li>
    <li> Before finding this hairdryer online, I was tempted to buy a $200 one advertised elsewhere.  What I was looking for is a hairdryer that won&#x27;t totally dry my color-treated hair out.  With my old one, my hair closely resembled a haystack, so I was forced to let my hair dry on its own.  Took a long time, but at least it looked decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one turned out to be fabulous!  For the price, you CANNOT go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use this dryer with a universal diffuser attachment and love the way it works. The air doesn&#x27;t blow too fast on the low setting. It only has 2 speed settings (fast and low) and 3 heat settings (hot, warm, and cold--cold is controlled by a release button, not a switch). The cord is pretty long, which can be nice.    I have very thick, above the shoulder-length hair. My hair is wavy/has big curls. This blow dryer, plus a diffuser attachment, works great for me.    Oh, and on the low setting, it&#x27;s not too loud!</li>
    <li> My good old trusty hair dryer kicked the bucket this weekend so I ordered this blow dryer because of all of the good reviews.  While it doesn&#x27;t blow as hot or as hard as my old dryer, it still got my hair dry slightly quicker.  And my hair looks DAMN good today - much better than it&#x27;s looked in a while.  Good end result.  I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> I needed to buy a new blow dryer but was low on cash. I just went on google and put out the question best blow dryer and this one came up and then of course the others for @$150 and then it told me I could get it at Walgreens for more or Amazon for like $19.00 and then I got it with free shipping, so what a deal!.   It is lightweight, low sound and works really well. It does get really hot but I then just turn it down to the med level.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research and based on other reviews, etc. thought this could be a suitable replacement for my old salon-quality hair dryer but it simply isn&#x27;t powerful enough. As a result, my hair turned out much frizzier than ever. Also, it doesn&#x27;t heat evenly, or it just gets too hot, which fried my hair. If you&#x27;re looking for a solid, tried and true dryer, I would say this most likely isn&#x27;t it. I thought I could get around the high price for a top performing dryer with this but was disappointed. I ultimately shelled out for the Elchim 3800, which was pricier but worth every penny. My hair has never looked better and it&#x27;s a vast improvement over this dryer.</li>
    <li> Still use this dryer every day, 4 years later, and it&#x27;s amazing. Dries my hair quickly and cuts frizz like a dream.</li>
    <li> When my old hair dryer suddenly stopped working (while I was part way through drying my hair and already late for work) I was distraught.  Partly due to the fact that I still had wet hair but also because I had to go find a new hair dryer.  I purchased this product soley based off the reviews of other Amazon users and I am really happy with it.  I have naturally curly hair and was concerned that the diffuser attachment that comes with the dryer wouldn&#x27;t get the job done.  However I have been pleasantly surprised.  This product is great!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quiet hair dryer to replace one I had that broke.  This one is quieter than others I have had, though still not really quiet.  It is light and dries hair quickly.  I need another and am ordering it again.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is I wish it folded for easier storage.</li>
    <li> This dryer is not as quiet as I expected (based on reviews on other sites), but man does it work well! On the low heat setting, it dried my hair in 1/2 the time that my old dryer did. I&#x27;m very happy with it and might actually blow dry my super thick hair on a more regular basis now. I also like that the barrel stays fairly cool so I can put it straight onto my bathroom counter after use.</li>
    <li> After using this dryer I was a bit surprised by two attributes others criticized:&lt;br /&gt;1.  There is sound but not the high pitched whine of previous products.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It dries quickly without seemingly getting very hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This size is quite compact and the price was very reasonable; as usual the attachments went into some distant drawer.  All in all, I&#x27;d replace it with another just like it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this dryer based on all the positive reviews.  Also, it was $10 less on Amazon than in my local store.    I am very pleased with the dryer so far-- works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it. Apparently me when the other, slightly more expensive Connairs I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I&#x27;ve used this as well and found it light and effective but not as good as she raves it to be.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer based on positive reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere. I have to wonder if Revlon paid for those reviews. For me, it was a total disaster. It has been compared to more expensive products with similar technology, but did not produce the same results whatsoever (I previously owned a high-end dryer that died after 5 years and did a very nice job while alive). Further, this dryer got so hot while drying my hair that it once literally burned my palm. It consistently emitted a horrible burning smell. Finally, it abruptly stopped working after 2 1/2 months, probably due to how hot it got. I am surprised and lucky that it didn&#x27;t catch on fire (yes, I should have returned it right away, but got caught up in life). I consider this a dangerous product which deserves zero stars. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> best hairdryer ever!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this dryer for sometime now and really love the attachment that diffuses the air. This gets my hair perfectly dry everytime.</li>
    <li> My wife loves using Revlon. Have been using these for years. The previous one last a little over 4 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter. She wanted an expensive professional model but agreed to try this first. She has coarse-wavy hair which takes forever to dry. She said it works very well and it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so lightweight but gets the job done. The diffuser is perfect size for my curly hair but doesn&#x27;t add the extra wieght that most do.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Lasted for 30 days. Nothing wrong with the machine until 30 days but the wire split after a month - A dryer needs to be moved around right? Thats all I did. Poor design caused the wire to just split/break which is NOT Safe and then stopped working - ofcourse if the wire breaks.</li>
    <li> This dryer is AMAZING! It&#x27;s light n powerful! Love it!</li>
    <li> Came in excellent  condition but made my hair brittle. Ill just use it occasionally</li>
    <li> As many of the poorly rated reviews state- my dryer stopped working after about 6 months use. I use it for about 5 minutes a day to blow dry just my short bangs so excessive usage could not have been the issue. There was no burnt plastic smell so I don&#x27;t think the motor had anything to do with the failure. I had two days where the dryer cut off and when I jiggled the cord it would come back on and continue working. Until day three when it just quit altogether. Obviously there is an issue with the cord and it having a short in it that causes the dryer to stop working. Interestingly enough the handy tab for hanging the blow dryer on a hook is located with the cord and where it attaches to the dryer. Likely hanging the blow dryer by this tab is what caused the error in my case. I bought this because of the reviews and the Revlon brand of quality. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> does what it has to do - one can change btn. hot and warm and cold. No unneccessary funcions, easy to handle and it&#x27;s pretty light so nice to hold. May not be the fastest hair dryer I&#x27;ve seen, but it does its job pretty well so I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Smells like something is burning when I use it.</li>
    <li> This hair drier is great for teasing hair and getting a bolder effect rather than just smooth and flat.  If this dryer lasts a long long time, and keeps doing what it is supposed to do, I would say it is almost perfect. I just wish it was a bit smaller since I found it in a &#x27;travel dryer&#x27; search.I got this dryer this week and used it a few times. It is not so noisy as others have said. Sounds more like a blender on low. The rocker controls are in exactly the right place for me because you can finish with a shot of cool air without taking the dryer away from your hair. It dries faster than my expensive ionic dryer and my hair looks and feels different, too....softer, shinier and styled the way I like it.</li>
    <li> I have had my this blow dryer for about a year now.  Though it started out strong, it now has lost the ability to heat up properly, thus leaving my hair frizzy.  I have to again look for another blow dryer that is affordable and lasts.  I have long thick hair.</li>
    <li> I used to have a hairdryer that I paid over $100 for, but it broke after several years of use. I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money again, and I am thrilled with the decision to purchase this hairdryer. My hair is long to my mid back and very thick, and I can blow dry it in less than 10 minutes with this hairdryer, and my hair is smoother than I have every gotten it! I would recommend this hairdryer highly. You really can&#x27;t get better quality at this price.</li>
    <li> I picked this up when it was only $12 and WOW I am so impressed! This dryer has cut my drying time by 65% and adds a tonne of shine. My hair is super coarse and curly and after drying straight with this dryer, I barely need to use a straightener. Great purchase, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just got this last November 2014. By December 20 it stopped working.  I unplugged it and pressed the reset button many times, but it worked only once and then stopped. It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
    <li> Very good blow dryer for curly or straight hair. I just wished we had bought the kind that folds up to save space. But this one does the job.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, has a cooler setting than my previous travel drier so I really like it!</li>
    <li> I used to hardly ever use hair dryers because they always made my hair really frizzy, poofy, and dried out. This one dries my hair very quickly and it feels much smoother and straighter than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve used. The fact that it&#x27;s only $20 makes it the perfect hair dryer for me.</li>
    <li> Came in on in and was great!</li>
    <li> I may not have bought this from amazon so I cannot say how long I have owned it. It has not been used much so I was surprised that it stoped working.</li>
    <li> This is my second Revlon hair dryer.  The first was&lt;br /&gt;quite satisfactory, so I ordered the second when&lt;br /&gt;my travel hair dryer died at my cabin.  The only&lt;br /&gt;reason it received 4 instead of 5 stars is that it occupies&lt;br /&gt;such awkward space, function is great.  I have very fine&lt;br /&gt;hair, and I make use of both temps.  Tools snap on easily.</li>
    <li> Light weight, functional, has enough settings for flexibility. A very nice product for its price. Bought it for college and it has been working very well for the last two or three weeks.</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer.  It is powerful and gets my thick hair dried quickly even when I use the diffuser.  It is much lighter and easier to hold and use than my old blowdryer. This is important as I have carpal tunnel.  And it is much quieter than my last dryer.  I saw this dryer in a store a couple of years ago and didn&#x27;t buy it.  Sorry I didn&#x27;t.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is a great value for the price. It has a sleek design. Comes with both attachments. VERY lightweight! The only issue I have with it are the placement of the buttons. I have, like some other reviewers, accidentally turned the dryer off while in use because of the button location. It&#x27;s not that big a deal but a simple flaw that could be fixed in the next model. I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s any quieter than my last hairdryer but it does cut down the drying time and leaves my hair a bit shinier than the last one as well.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom she loves it</li>
    <li> Like I say, above, the on/off switch is EXACTLY where my fingers grip the handle -- I can&#x27;t say how many times I&#x27;ve accidentally turned off the dryer.  Others have talked about how light it is -- it&#x27;s okay, not superlight but not heavy.  It functions okay -- when I haven&#x27;t accidentally squeezed it off, LOL.</li>
    <li> Very good item in reasonable price. It arrived in time. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this dryer -- quiet, fast-drying, lightweight -- until it died yesterday after owning it for less than two and half years. Perhaps my expectation are too high? I used this almost daily, but my hair dries in about 10 minutes, so I don&#x27;t quite understand how that would wear it out so quickly. To be honest, other Revlon hair dryers haven&#x27;t lasted too long for me, either, so I think this is the last Revlon hair dryer I&#x27;ll purchase. I&#x27;m tired of replacing these things so frequently. (Will someone please make a hair dryer that lasts? I will pay extra for that!)&lt;br /&gt;This dryer gets two stars for the two years I owned it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, got it on sale w/ prime shipping. Works like a charm, had it for a few months now, already bought another for a friend.</li>
    <li> less than one year, stop working. bad quality.</li>
    <li> I have this and for Christmas, I bought two for my daughters. They both have told me at least 3 times how much they love it. One told me she doesn&#x27;t need to use as much product for frizzy hair. The other said her drying time is cut in half. Fast delivery and packaged well</li>
    <li> My Revlon Tourmaline Ionic hair dryerer died today.  I had it for four years and use it almost everyday.  I am getting another one.  It is great.  Very powerful, dries hair fast and is lightweight.  I have fine hair, but a lot of it. When I use this my hair looks professionally done. I am so glad they still make it.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well. Dries my thick shoulder length hair quickly without scorching it.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> As an electrician I am somewhat qualified to review why this hairdryer fails and is a danger. My hairdryer failed to last a year because the cord just under the strain relief has severed internally under the rubber from mechanical fatigue. When this happens the dryer will lose power and regain power if you flex the cord, eventually if you keep using it, the arcing at the break will overheat and the cord will: smoke, burn, pop, expose the conductors and maybe catch on fire. All they need to do is use a higher quality cord, otherwise this dryer would be fine. As it is, it&#x27;s a hazard that is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone found this hairdryer to be too big. I am a short chick with short arms and I can easily hold this away from my head with out any trouble. It gets the job done quickly !</li>
    <li> it was good while it lasted. 6 months in something in the heat function broke and it didn&#x27;t work as well as it originally did.  About a year in the whole dryer broke.  It will now live in a landfill for millions of years...</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this dryer and am returning it.  It is very loud, the diffuser attachment is very small and the hot setting was not hot enough for me.  I have very thick, very curly hair (just below shoulder length) and diffuse my hair every day.  The diffuser that came as an attachment is much smaller and is flat and has the fingers sticking out, which ended up poking my head.  The Helen of Troy diffuser I&#x27;ve used for years has a bigger circumference and is concave so the fingers don&#x27;t touch your head.  Also, most ionic dryers leave your hair shiny, but this dryer left my hair frizzy and dull.  I also wish it had a longer cord.  On the hottest heat setting, it just felt like the ends of my hair were getting dry, not my roots.  For curly hair, if you don&#x27;t get the roots dry, you end up with flat hair that is curly on the bottom a.k.a. \\&quot;triangle head.\\&quot;    On the up side, it is very light.  Someone with thin or straight hair may really like it.  But if you have thick, curly hair...this dryer is mostly just noise.</li>
    <li> i bought this hair dryer for the second bathroom, and it&#x27;s now in our master bathroom. lightweight, quick hair dryer. clean, simple design. functions are pretty standard. i&#x27;m not sure if the tourmaline ionic really does what it claims, but the price was about the same as other models without the feature, so i figured i might as well get it. my only (slight)complaint is that it has rocker switches instead of slider switches. sometimes when you&#x27;re shaking the dryer around, you can inadvertantly shut the unit off. no big deal, but it is a drawback. otherwise, excellent product.</li>
    <li> Amidst the happy reviews there are just a few that mention that this might not be a good dryer for fine hair. Wish I&#x27;d listened! My fine, straight hair is normally no big deal to style but this dryer leaves it limp, limp, limp. Plenty of hair spray is the only way to salvage a little curl. And perhaps because my hair is both fine and short, the dryer runs too hot for me. Can&#x27;t handle pain before breakfast. Glad it works well for so many folks but, for me, time to find another dryer. I strongly recommend the Elchim Professional 2001 2000 Watt Classic Hair Dryer, which is not ionic, works perfectly with my fine hair, and has proved worth the higher price.</li>
    <li> I never ever write reviews...but this hair dryer is awesome! I have waist length medium thickness hair that when not straightened is very curly/wavy/frizzy. And after blow drying before flatiron my hair is usually pretty frizzy. First off this hair dryer is much quieter than most . Second my hair was dry in 6 minutes. Seriously. The best part was my hair was very smooth and not frizzy / flyaway. And after the cold shot button it was amazing. I didn&#x27;t even use my flat iron. And a great price..... I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> This dryer is great, and I am really glad I purchased it. I was on the fence, but for price and performance, this can&#x27;t be beat.  For reference, I have thick, long hair that is wavy in the back and I style it straight.    Pros: great price, lightweight, dries fast with little-to-no static!  Cons: louder than my previous hair dryer</li>
    <li> Dries hair pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my wife and she liked it. Its handy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I was torn between purchasing this and the ConAir version of the same thing.  I was turned off by the Conair reviews about the weight of the hairdry.  I don&#x27;t regret my decision at all!  I have curly hair and I wear it both straight and curly.  The high setting is perfect for when I straighten my hair and the light setting makes perfect curls.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Pros:  It dries hair fast without letting it freeze. It&#x27;s inexpensive.  Cons: It&#x27;s noisy and it doesn&#x27;t feel durable. The first one delivered broke the second time I used. The seller replaced it and until now it&#x27;s ok, but I am always waiting for something wrong to happen.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is OK.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I would like.  It is very light weight and I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing.  It almost seems flimsy.  But heck, for the price what can you exect.  Here&#x27;s my chief complaint about this product: the on/off and temperature toggle switches are on the INSIDE of the handle.  What this means is that while you are drying your hair, you have to be VERY careful how you hold it or you will turn the dryer off.  It happens at least a couple of times every time I dry my hair.  It is most annoying.</li>
    <li> Pretty much life-changing. Went from curly hair that blows out straight but with lots of frizz, to curly hair that blew out straight as a stick with no frizz whatsoever… No other change to my routine other than the dryer! Big thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I must admit, I wasn&#x27;t expecting the response that I received from my wife. After seeing that she was constantly complaining that she need a better hairdryer, I set out to research and try to find her the best one. After careful research, I settled on this one. I will never forget her reaction after her first time using it. The most notable claim obviously was how fast it dried her hair. Easily a quarter of the time it usually takes her and also how lightweight it was. She herself proclaimed that next to diamonds, this was probably the best gift she had ever received. I highly recommend this hairdryer for anyone who is looking to drastically cut their hairdrying time.</li>
    <li> I thought I would like the fingers to be longer, but it is just right.  It doesn&#x27;t blow my hair around as much as the other ones, so for curly hair it keeps the waves in place while drying!  And the head doesn&#x27;t fall off like older models did!</li>
    <li> It is lightweight and it is SUPER fast to dry my thick, wavy hair. I love the diffuser attachment, but mostly I just use it as a regular dryer without that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it&#x27;s noisy, all of them are, but sometimes I think I hear music from inside. Or maybe I have just gone a little crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this, it&#x27;s well worth, especially with the amazon discount!</li>
    <li> I liked this hairdryer a lot, but after maybe a year of occasional use, it now has a &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; in the cord.  It will only work for a few seconds at a time before shutting off, and I have to wiggle the cord to get it started again.  For the price (it&#x27;s currently half off the list price), I would still buy it again, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last for years or anything.</li>
    <li> This thing is practically a toy. Had to send back.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer in February 2014. Used it just about every day until this past Wednesday, November 26th when it didn&#x27;t work anymore. For a couple days leading up to Wednesday there were issues with the cord where I had to hold the cord at the base of the dryer just right to get it to work. When it worked it worked well, but it should last longer than 9 months.</li>
    <li> Great product. This dryer dries my hair really quickly. The narrow nozzle for straightening my hair fits on there securely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about a year. I usually use the high speed but now in the middle of drying a section of hair, it&#x27;s started reverting to the low setting for a few seconds, then goes back to high. This didn&#x27;t start until just recently so I&#x27;m figuring it&#x27;s about to die out on me. When the speeds change, the lights in my house start flickering. I&#x27;m just wondering it anyone else had this problem? I need to find a 3 speed AND 3 heat setting drier since the high setting on this dryer is extremely hot, burning my scalp but low setting is way too low. HELP!</li>
    <li> This is a great value for the money.  It works extremely well to smooth and quickly dry hair.  I have frizzy hair and this dryer has been a lifesaver.  With minimal effort and dryer skills, my hair is smooth a polished.  I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on it and I am all thumbs with hairstyling.      The only con I would note is that it is quite loud.  I previously had a Chi dryer and it was so super quiet.  But for the money and the performance I&#x27;ll take a few extra decibels.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little loud but I&#x27;m used to it because my previous dryer was pretty loud too. It&#x27;s light weight which I like. The diffuser and concentrator are rather large. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love Revlon. It&#x27;s great dryer</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. When it comes to drying hair, it does so in half the time that her past dryers did. That and her hair is completely dry opposed to other dryers. A quote from my wife was, &amp;#34;I never knew my hair could look this good!&amp;#34; If your current dryer isn&#x27;t doing the trick, this dryer is the treat it deserves.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this dryer for me for Christmas.  I have very thick, curly/wavy shoulder length hair.  With previous dryers I would take forever blowdrying my hair only to have it frizz, then I&#x27;d have to use a flat iron.  Eventually, I got fed up with trying to style my hair and just let my hair \\&quot;go natural\\&quot;.  I talked to my hairdresser who suggested an ionic/tourmaline dryer.  My husband picked this one because of the good reviews.     Well, the first time I used it I was amazed.  My hair looked as good as it does when I leave the salon and dried very quickly.  Another big plus was that the dryer was very light.  Previously, my arms would get tired and my neck and shoulders would hurt (I have muscle spasms in this area) trying to dry and style my hair but not with this dryer.  It also eliminated the need for a flat iron which really cut down on time spent on my hair.    Other reviewers said the dryer was noisy and the buttons were difficult to control but I haven&#x27;t noticed a problem with either issue.  The buttons took a little time to get used to but once I used the dryer a few times, it was fine.  Also, the only attachment I have used is the concentrator so I can&#x27;t comment on the diffuser    This hairdryer truly is amazing.  I even got my hair cut into a trendier style now that I can control it.  If you looking for a dryer that will make styling your hair easier, faster and make your hair look healthier, thiis is it!</li>
    <li> I have very long wavy but fine hair... prone to frizziness/puffiness.  I regularly straighten my hair using only a hair dryer.  This one doesn&#x27;t cut it.  It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as others I&#x27;ve used (better for my hair I&#x27;m sure, but not when I want to straighten), resulting in a much longer dry time.  It leaves my hair looking noticeably more frizzy/unhealthy.  Probably fine for the average user, but if you need a hair dryer that smooths and straightens, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> MUCH quieter than my old blow dryer. Drys my hair quicker too. It came with two attachments. One was a diffuser. I wanted to see what a diffuser would do for my hair--not much. I use the dryer w/no attachments and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer!  It&#x27;s surprisingly light considering the power it has.  I really like the diffuser, too.  It works well and very quickly on my curly hair.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently experienced a very expensive flat iron so I was in the mindset to think that only a very expensive blow dryer would do.  However, like the informed consumer that I am, I did my research online as to which dryer was the best.  From what I read, this dryer performed very well against others on the market and was second only to the T3 dryer that cost over $300.      When it really came down to it, there were no specifics as to what made the T3 better.  Since this was around $30, I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I didn&#x27;t need the dryer to do many things.  I style my hair with heat (flat iron) so I blow dry on \\&quot;warm\\&quot; only.  I do not style with the dryer anymore, only to dry it and give it a little volume.  Perhaps my previous dryers are to blame for my clumsiness with the dryer (on myself).  When I&#x27;m doing other people&#x27;s hair, no problem, but on my own head, the dryer always felt foreign and positioned incorrectly.      This dryer changed my whole outlook.  It drys my hair really fast from just showered (I rarely bother to towel dry the way \\&quot;they\\&quot; say I should) and is SO lightweight!  My arms are not sore from lifting the round brush UP, AWAY from my head, and twirl, twirl.  I can switch hands when I dry the other side of my head instead of ending up with one side that is bouncy and fresh and one side that didn&#x27;t get the right direction of TLC.      I will never use the diffuser on myself so I can&#x27;t say how that works.  The other one, the focus?  Narrow thing?  Is great.  Even on \\&quot;warm\\&quot; it takes less time to dry my waist-long hair than my other dryer on \\&quot;hot.\\&quot;  It is so quick that I don&#x27;t lose patience and give up.  I&#x27;m not a hair person and I want results QUICK.      I used to dread washing my hair because of blow drying after.  This changed my whole perspective.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter  was very pleased this was a gift, she really liked the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer for my girlfriend because she&#x27;s always in a battle vs frizz. I didn&#x27;t think there would be as much difference between switching dryers (as this one wasn&#x27;t too expensive).    The dryer is light, and dries quickly, and best of all... her hair has noticeably less frizz using this dryer! My girlfriend has shoulder length hair and kind&#x27;ve thick, so its nice that her hair can still dry quickly. She&#x27;s very happy with the dryer, and when she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy. Recommended.</li>
    <li> To it&#x27;s credit, this dryer is lightweight.  The description of this item states it is \\&quot;super quiet;\\&quot; however, I found it to be quite loud on the high setting.  Also, the diffuser attachment hurts my head.  Someone needs to tell the folks at Revlon that the human head is spherical--not flat.  Finally, the cold shot button takes several seconds before the air temperature drops; it&#x27;s far quicker and simpler to just turn the dryer away from your hair to set the style.  I am not able to see any increase in shine, luster, or smoothness from an ordinary hairdryer without Tourmaline or Ionic technology.</li>
    <li> The Revlon Tourmaline hair dryer drys as fast as advertised.  It is also very lightweight.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for about a year. It started off working perfectly, i was surprised how powerful it was for such an inexpensive hair dryer, but i guess you really do get what you pay for...  A few weeks after i started using it it started flickering between the high and the low setting without me touching any buttons. I didn&#x27;t think much of it, but as time went on it got worse and worse. Now it wont stay on for a minute without flickering to the lower setting, and since no buttons were pushed i have to wait it out for it to come back on high. It takes me 40 minutes to blow dry my hair when it used to take 20. I am in the market for a new blow dryer, but i wont be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> I saw this model hair dryer at Target.  I was trying to find a hairdryer that fit an attachment from an old hairdryer that broke.  It fit perfectly on the sample (cord cut) model at Target, but they did not have any in stock.  I searched for the model on Amazon and found what I thought was it.  The attachment doesn&#x27;t fit, so have no use for the dryer...it was pricey too for a travel hairdryer.</li>
    <li> The dryer looks good and feels light.  However the second time I used it, the switch to turn it off stopped working.  I had to unplug it to stop the dryer.  I just think it doesn&#x27;t have a good solid quality.</li>
    <li> I had spent $130.00 on the same hairdryer my hairdresser used by CHI about 2 years ago. It stopped blowing hot air, so after looking at the reviews on the Revlon RV544, I decided to take my chances on it. It works better than the CHI for $130.00. It is lighter and dries my hair quicker. I use the diffuser as I have curly hair. I have cut my drying time in half. I am extremely happy with my choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Vidal Sassoon travel hair dryer for years and it was time to replace it.  I started looking at more expensive brands and was about to pay $139 on a light weight Sedu.  I asked my hairdresser for recommendations and she actually told me to save my money and buy a drug store brand.  After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I settled on the Revlon RV544.  It&#x27;s bigger than my travel hair dryer but it&#x27;s about the same weight and it&#x27;s a lot more powerful.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I like it.  Unlike some reviewers, I don&#x27;t find the buttons poorly placed and I think the cord is a good length.  Bottom line, you can&#x27;t beat the Revlon RV544 for the price.  UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve changed my mind about this blow dryer.  I have a lot of fine, layered hair. The blow dryer doesn&#x27;t give my hair body.  I thought my hair was looking flat because I was in need of a hair cut.  Then I used a blow dryer at my gym and my hair looked fine.  I realized that it&#x27;s not my hair, it&#x27;s the dryer.  NEW BOTTOM LINE:  Based on the positive reviews, I think this hair dryer is good for people with thick or curly or frizzy hair.  I can&#x27;t recommend it for people with fine hair.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS DRYER AFTER READING THE REVIEWS, AND WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL.  BUT IT WORKS LIKE IT SAYS..IT DRIES HAIR SUPER FAST, I HAVE LONG THICK HAIR AND I CAN DRY MY WHOLE HEAD IN 15 MINUTES....IT&#x27;S A GREAT LIGHTWEIGHT DRYER.  THE DIFFUSER IS A LITTLE AWKWARD, BUT I LOVE THIS DRYER......</li>
    <li> I have carpal tunnel syndrome in my left hand and was trying to use a heavier hair dryer was not working. My fingers kept falling asleep. This dryer is very light and effective. I have been searching and searching for a concentrator nozzle, could not find one to fit my hair dryer. This attachment with this hair dryer works great. My hair is smooth and dries half the time then my old hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have been using some old hair dryer since college (using for 7yrs).  I needed a new one and came across this one.     I bought it because...  1) Price was reasonable  2) Positive comments were abundant  3) when it came, it was light!!!    been using it for over a month now.  Works great</li>
    <li> great product ,price exceptional, hair looks great</li>
    <li> This is hands down, the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  The hot setting is very hot but, you don&#x27;t really need to use it. The warm works just as well and only adds a couple of minutes.    *What is amazing is the finished product - WAY LESS FLYAWAYS and my hair stays frizz-free all day (and that is NOT what I normally see with my hair).    Don&#x27;t let the price fool you - this is a VERY GOOD hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST blow dryer for this price. Hands down. Love the diffuser extension for my curly wash n go&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I expected this dryer to do the job in 5 minutes. I was delighted when my hair was dry in 3 minutes. Great product, purchased 2 more to give as gifts, and they were very well received :)</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is great! It now takes me 60% less time to dry my thick long hair. Light weight, great buy.</li>
    <li> Dryer is lightweight and dries hair quickly.  I use the hot setting and do not think it&#x27;s too hot and my hair is not super thick.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very satisified with this dryer.  It is light weight, easy to use and the tourmaline feature actually dries your hair faster than regular dryers. It even has a light that lets you know it is tourmalining.  The cord is plenty long enough for normal use. The ground fault plug is small and unobtrusive.  I don&#x27;t use the round black thing but use the intensifier nozzle a lot.  The button placement could be better but what the heck, it&#x27;s only a hair dryer not an instrument for brain surgery.  If you hit the wrong button you will instantly know it. Just look down at the handle and make another selection. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Had a more expensive Babyliss that died after only a few months. That was \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; and claimed to speed up drying for long hair (mine is colored as well). It didn&#x27;t. Thought the whole ionic thing was just hype until I got this dryer. Wow! What a difference it makes in drying my hair. I have also noticed a huge improvement in the shine and smoothness in my hair after using this dryer - all the things I was expecting of the one I had before. I will never go back to the more expensive dryers. They are a waste of money not to mention disappointing. This one is a great value, lightweight and powerful and far exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Its a very good one. I use it almost after every shower and I am so satisfied with its performance</li>
    <li> I was long overdue to upgrade.  I have very thick,  hair that I just dont want to cut short and this dryer makes it so easy to smooth out if I want to. I thought it had a lint filter though and I have not been able to find it. My old blow dryer finally died so off I finally got to buy a new one without feeling guilty. After some research, I picked this one and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> My wife is the main user so I asked her what were the &#x27;goods&#x27; and &#x27;could be improveds for this dryer.&#x27;   Overall, she likes it a bunch!   Great cooling control with the &#x27;cool&#x27; button.  Other buttons work well, just need to be aware of which one you want to use.  It is lightweight and many of the competition brands are too! It is quieter than our last dryer.</li>
    <li> This has definitely cut the time it actually dries hair-- i haven&#x27;t tried styling yet, just because I have had enough time to style- or i&#x27;m going to bed right away &amp; then why style.. but I would definitely recommend it.. it is light weight and dryes faster than my old hair dryer...</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace one that was fabulous....until the day when it stopped heating.  This is so lightweight and dries my hair very quickly. It&#x27;s an excellent replacement that exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have very thick long hair. It normally takes me 20 mins to get my hair completely dry and I burn through the blow dryers very quickly. . This one did it in 6 mins!!!! I am very pleased. Hopefully it will last a year for me!</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews saying this was a quiet hair dryer I bought it and compared it to my ancient VS quiet traveler. It was louder. Other than that it seems to be a decent hair dryer but my hearing is more important to me, so I&#x27;ve returned it. The search continues.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price. I like that it many settings for one to choose from.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time Amazon buyer - but don&#x27;t write many reviews.  My review now is by happen-stance as I was poking around in \\&quot;my account\\&quot; options and was reviewing what I had purchased over the years and came across this purchase in 2006.      Can&#x27;t recommend this dryer enough ( and yes - perhaps the newer models have changed in appearance/button location).  Bottom line - hair dries in much, much less time and this dryer is still going steady after 3 years of use.    You can pay $75.00 ---&gt; on up if you choose to buy another dryer because you can&#x27;t handle where the buttons are located on this dryer.  So do what ever floats the boat.   But for my money and the same results - you can&#x27;t find a better dryer anywhere for this price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about two years, and it held up pretty well during that time.  Recently, it started making a burning smell, and regular cleaning of the lint area hasn&#x27;t helped, so I figured it was time to replace the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this Revlon unit here on Amazon since it was rated as a Consumer Digest Best Buy, and it&#x27;s a decent dryer for the price.  If you have shorter hair that is not too thick, this dryer should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, instead of buying a new one of these to replace my old one, I decided to upgrade to a Sedu brand dryer -- and the difference between the two is amazing.  With this Revlon dryer, it took me at least a good 15 minutes to fully dry my short, thick hair.  The Sedu dryer dries my hair in less than five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good, mid-priced dryer, than this Revlon works well and will last a long time.  However, if you want a faster drying time, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.  I didn&#x27;t know how slow this thing was until I splurged on a more expensive unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would give this Revlon unit 3 1/2 stars.</li>
    <li> Works great, dries my hair MUCH faster than my previous dryer... or any dryer I have ever used outside of a salon. I am completely satisfied with it, ESPECIALLY for the GREAT price (I got mine for $16.99). Yes, as some reviews mention... it does get very hot on High, (but I have a lot of hair so maybe thats why it&#x27;s not a big deal to me). Yes, the power control buttons are placed stupidly/as rocker buttons, but that is also not a deal-breaker for me either. -So once in a while I shut it off or accidentally change it&#x27;s setting, big deal! I then turn it back on or flip it back to high! It&#x27;s not particularly frustrating.  I researched and researched hairdryer&#x27;s before I made the decision to buy this one several months ago after my old dryer broke. This was the one I found, and back then it was $30+. I ended up discovering how to fix my old dryer, and so it wasn&#x27;t&#x27; until I lost my old dryer moving that I actually went ahead and bought this one around Christmas. It was a great choice!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair, so I need a hairdryer with some serious power and heat.  This model is much better than my last hairdryer.  It only has two heat settings, but that&#x27;s all I really need.  I sometimes accidentally turn it off because of where the on/off switch is, but it takes 0.5 seconds to turn it back on so who cares.  It doesn&#x27;t just blow air into my hair, it blows my hair around and gets it dry much faster than other hairdryers. It&#x27;s light so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.  I haven&#x27;t had problems with it sucking my hair into the intake vent either.  I&#x27;ve had it for more than a year, and if it dies, I&#x27;ll get another one.   Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Can not beat this hair dryer for the price.  I had a Chi blow dryer for 10 years, and it died.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative.  This is definitely it!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000FS05VG Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black]]&lt;br /&gt;The reviews here convinced me to try this dryer. I was sold on the Ionic capability after my first very expensive dryer from another company. Wasn&#x27;t too familiar with Tourmaline or what it did, but I noticed everyone had it now, so why not...&lt;br /&gt;So to add on to the other reviews- I have VERY long (thigh length) hair. The hair itself is fine, but there&#x27;s alot of it, so it takes a long time to dry, and I blow dry every day. My first purchases were duds. Too heavy, too long to dry, too hot...I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get it right.&lt;br /&gt;For the small price of this dryer, I figured I&#x27;d try it. Indeed, it&#x27;s well constructed, very light to hold, and comes with the big diffuser attachment you see in the pic, and a smaller mouth attachment for focused drying. I almost want to buy a second one and hide it away for when this one eventually blows up, so I don&#x27;t have to search for a perfect replacement like this again! I tried several different brands and price ranges before I bought this, and I have to say price is the only difference. It&#x27;s a tad loud on the highest level, but all of the dryers were, so I couldn&#x27;t take off a star for that!&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful to buy the RV544. There are MANY different Revlon dryers out there, and they are ALL DIFFERENT! I tried a few! This is the one you want.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift.      It is very light and powerful.  At first I thought the Tourmaline Ionic was a bit of a gimmick but my wife really likes it.  She says it leaves her hair softer than before and the driver is much faster than her old dryer.  I guess it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> Very light weight. Love the settings. Diffuser works great. Best blow dryer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. She has lots of naturally thick and wavy hair. It used to take her almost 45 minutes to completely dry her hair and now takes less than 15!!  Not an exaggeration. She is still amazed after nearly a month. She said I not only gave her a hair dryer as a gift, I gave her the gift of time.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product works great and I spend less time drying thick coarse hair. So glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a hair dryer like the one used by her hair dresser. It was light, powerful, and dried her hair really fast. Not sure what brand it was, but I cringed at paying several hundred dollars for a blower. Saw the rave reviews on this Revlon model. Decided to take a chance and save some bucks. Bottom line, my wife is thrilled. She can&#x27;t believe how good this thing is. Thank you Revlon! And thank you Amazon for the great deal!</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer!!! I did a lot of research on hairdryers, and I&#x27;m so pleased to have found this product. It&#x27;s very lightweight, quiet, &amp; dries my hair super quick. I wish it was a little more compact (for travel), but for everyday home use, it&#x27;s absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this dryer. I wanted something that had the ion technology yet was lightweight, dried hair quickly, left my hair shiny, yet was reasonably priced. I came very close to purchasing one of the $100+ high-end driers, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. This little guy is strong, extremely lightweight, and leaves my hair really shiny. It also dries my hair quickly. I gave it 4 stars because the concentrator attachment fits pretty loosely on the nozzle, so it tends to turn and shift position while I&#x27;m using the drier, and I have to re-adjust several times. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> very strong----looks like it will last.!</li>
    <li> I havefine, thin hair also and this dryer works well for me.  Just be sure to section hair and not put too much on the brush.  The hot setting is quite warm while teh warm setting is much easier on the hair.  I would have likes a toggle switch for the cold setting so as not to have to hold the cold button down while using this temp to set the style which is difficult when you are moving the dryer around.  Otherwise its a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I should have read more reviews on this item--looked popular but it&#x27;s awful. My main complaint is that the handle gets so incredibly hot after just a short time you cannot hold on to it. I&#x27;ve burned my hand a few times and it also smells like it&#x27;s burning. Some reviews have said that it sparks and caught fire!!</li>
    <li> I went out of my way to buy this one (not to mention a day on research I did to find a good diffuser) . I asked my realtive to buy it from US and ship it to UK. I bought a $55 adaptor and this diffuser blows off when I switched on. I have many other US hair tools (Remington , Conair etc) which worked perfectly on this adaptor so its definitely not adaptor problem. Well, I was hoping to use it everyday and I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it even once...very very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I have had mine for 5 years and I love it! I will never buy another kind</li>
    <li> Horrible design and very dangerous.  I purchased this unit in November 2014 from Amazon.  Only lasted 6 months.   I turned it on the other day and it didn&#x27;t work.  I thought the GFCI was tripped so I pressed the button...that was not the issue.  I then tried the power switch again and a huge spark and smoke came from the area where the cord enters the dryer.  My first instinct was to unplug the unit and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Turned out the unit shorted at that point and burned completely through the cord and insulation.  Very dangerous and could have easily caused an electrocution if someone inadvertently grabbed that area instead.  I never wrapped the cord around the unit or subjected it to falls or other abuse.  Revlon&#x27;s warranty policy is ridiculous.  They want the buyer to send the unit back as well as $6 to cover handling.  By the time someone does this it would have cost more than the unit.    MY ONLY ADVICE IS JUST TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNIT AND LOOK ELSEWHERE...THIS IS A BAD PRODUCT AND COULD CAUSE HARM TO SOMEONE!!!</li>
    <li> I gave myself about a month to adjust to this new dryer so I wouldn&#x27;t be critical as a result of something new and different. It&#x27;s a nice dryer--lightweight and powerful. However, my big gripe is the fact that the switch placement results in advertently turning the dryer on and off. I had the slider switch on my old one and it was a much better design.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product for the price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot for this.  I went back to my old Wally World cheapie.  It didn&#x27;t dry my thick hair any faster nor did it make it smoother.  Seems like any other hair dryer to me and actually it dried slower for me.  Go figure.  I gave it 3 stars because it did work, just not like I had hoped.  I have mid back very thick straight/wavy hair.  To be fair, my hairdresser comments on how long my hair takes to dry.  So, it is VERY thick.  The price point is fair, you&#x27;re not paying a whole lot more than something you&#x27;d pick up at the store, but don&#x27;t expect anything impressive.  I reply on amazon reviews and in this case I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to replace an ancient, 1980&#x27;s-era blow dryer, and based my choice on its excellent reviews. I have to agree, this is an excellent product. I first noticed that even on the highest setting the dryer did not get as hot as my old one. I thought this might be a problem, but actually it is an advantage as it won&#x27;t burn you if you leave it in one place too long. The volume of air being pushed out of this dryer is far stronger than my old hair dryer, so it dries very fast. I have naturally wavy hair that tends to frizz and I used the dryer to straighten it. Much to my surprise, this dryer not only dried my hair very quickly, it left it very smooth with no frizz. It must be the lower heat with the strong blast of air that works so well. Whatever it is, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I read a ton of reviews on this hairdryer before I bought it, so naturally I was concerned with the few minor people out there that gave &#x27;negative&#x27; reviews...but with the overall great ratings on this, I went ahead and bought it since it met all of my criteria, which were 1. Light, 2. Less noisy, 3. Some kind of ionic smooth hair function (even if it was 99% hype I STILL wanted it), and 4. super EASY buttons to use (because I hate the slider ones that are tougher to change).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is the lightest hairdryer I&#x27;ve come across...and I HELD all the ones opened on the sales floor at my local Target to compare how weighty each felt! Also, this hairdryer was bought to replace an aging one I&#x27;ve had, which started to have sparks flying out of it...and compared to that one, this is significantly less noisy. I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for the past three months now, and for it being under $20 I think this purchase is a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, every now and then while drying my hair I&#x27;ll accidentally trip one of the buttons from high to low...but the tradeoff is acceptable and I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about the design- I love how easy it is to change settings. It&#x27;s just a matter of holding it carefully so it doesn&#x27;t happen again.</li>
    <li> Great price great product fast shipping.</li>
    <li> After much searching, trying others and a lot of research, I finally found a GREAT hairdryer!  I can honestly say this is the best one I used and so glad I purchased it. The diffuser, I haven&#x27;t used, but I&#x27;m sure is fine. I purchased a separate universal one from Conair. It is a tourmaline one. I like the diffusers a bit curved in the middle (this one is flat), like a cup so that I can make my waves a bit curlier and it does just that. Although my hair is consistently frizzy, this leaves it a bit less so, but with some products in my hair, it helps. It doesn&#x27;t last all day, then again, it is a hair dryer.    This is the next best one, from what I have read, to the T3. I love the cool setting and everything. Those who had complained regarding the placement of the switches and buttons... maybe they don&#x27;t know how to use a hair dryer, or have really big hands, but I have yet to get that problem.</li>
    <li> I have tried it, but not as quiet as expected. It is a Christmas Present, so hope my wife LIKES IT.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> very nice. great price. who needs more?</li>
    <li> Just like everyone else said! My wavy, thick hair now dries in 6 minutes. I&#x27;m very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer for my wife. For the first few months it was perfect. But then something happened to the cord and the hair dryer wouldn’t blow air even when it was turned on unless the cord was tweaked in a certain way. This lasted for about one week and then suddenly it sparked and caught on fire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product because it is unsafe!</li>
    <li> I blow dry my hair just about every other day and I hadnt purchased a new hair dryer in about 7 years (even though I used it all the time, I cannot think of the brand- I tossed it and now just cannot remember).&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I was looking for a hair dryer with a diffuser and high temperature settings, I have very long hair and was just thinking about cutting drying time.&lt;br /&gt;I love the attachments, The dryer gets really hot and I can get my hair dry in about 5-8 minutes, rather than the 15 it was taking me before. Great quality dryer, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my new hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Works just fine. Really don&#x27;t have any problem with this one. Dries my hair pretty quick and does so silently. There&#x27;s just a soft hum.</li>
    <li> Good product. Don&#x27;t spend tons of money for a hair dryer. This can do it all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hair dryer.  It does what it should.  I have never been wow&#x27;d by a hair dryer.  This one seems to have a tad less oomph than the one it replaced, but seems to dry my hair in similar time and fashion.  I can&#x27;t give it five stars because other reviewers made this sound like a dreamy hair dryer.  I&#x27;m thinking hair dryers are pretty much the same across the line at this point.</li>
    <li> I had much higher hopes on this item based upon the Ionic feature.  I don&#x27;t believe it worked that much better. Oh well. It still is a good dryer for a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this hair dryer for a few weeks, but so far it does not disappoint. Sits great in the hand, useful controls of heat and strength. Great hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I use a hair dryer everyday and also color my hair.  These are both actions that can dry aging hair and make it look less than pleasing.  Fortunately, my last hair dryer broke and I suffered through days of research to find another.  This one makes my hair look lustrous and full even the day I color it.</li>
    <li> I have paid out hundreds of dollars for hair dryers and I can honestly say that this beats all of them even the most expensive ones. It is lightweight, drys my thick hair faster than all the others, doesn&#x27;t overheat and shut down (like my last one kept doing that I paid almost a $100 for) and doesn&#x27;t make my colored hair loose moisture. I do hope that they continue making this product but I am thinking about buying another one just in case.</li>
    <li> this blow dryer is much hotter than i expected it to be. it&#x27;s very quiet except for my screaming when my scalp is on fire. i actually love this blow dryer though. it&#x27;s light and powerful</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned and I think I&#x27;ve owned at least one since 1980. Lightweight, good ergonomics, faster than I expected, and seems to prevent that static effect blow dryers often cause in fine-textured hair.  I don&#x27;t know about the tourmaline but I do know I like this blow dryer.  The wife.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old male who wanted a hair dryer to dry my feet after showering to prevent athletes foot (as reccommend by my podiatrist). I simply wanted something powerful and long lasting, I don&#x27;t know what the attachments are for and have not used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is powerful, in 2 months has shown no signs of faltering.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has two settings for heat (hot and warm) and two settings for strength (high and low). Plus a Cool setting that feels nice after getting all steamy.&lt;br /&gt;3. On the highest setting it drys my feet very quickly. I enjoy it so much that i&#x27;ll use it on the rest of my body where a towel can&#x27;t seem to wick away the last bits of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;None really, I can see this drying out your scalp if you don&#x27;t set it on a lower setting, but I imagine any hair dryer could do that.</li>
    <li> First, great price for the product. I&#x27;ve looked at stores like Target and WalMart and couldn&#x27;t find anything like this for this good of a price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this dryer works great. It used to take me 20+ mins to dry my hair with my old dryer (I have very thick hair). With this one, my entire head of hair is dry, completely dry, in less then 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, I&#x27;ve had this obsession with split ends for years and years, where I would find them and get rid of them by cutting them off (I know, ridiculous). However, since I&#x27;ve started using this dryer, I haven&#x27;t been able to find split ends at all. This has been a major relief to my daughter, who was sick of me spending so much time looking at my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, I always have had static problems with my hair in the winter time, no matter what products I used in it. Since I&#x27;ve started using this dryer, and the winter season has come around, I haven&#x27;t had any static problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the components of the dryer itself, I like that it has a warm and hot setting with the optional cool button. I have accidentally shut off the dryer while using it a few times, but once I got used to where the controls were, it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a wonderful hair dryer that has saved me lots of time drying and has done wonderful things in regards to the condition of my hair. I would recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a dryer.</li>
    <li> Too much good!!! Aproved!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this...my hair comes out perfect every time&lt;br /&gt; I feel like I have less frizz, less than ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if any ionic dryers actually make a difference, but all I know is that this is just like a normal dryer, I see no difference in shine, softness or anything else. Having said that, its a good dryer, works fine, strong enough to straighten my hair (which is relatively curly)</li>
    <li> It turns on, heats, blows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have with this hair dryer is that it DOES NOT have a filter that can be removed and cleaned.  This is the one and only thing that could extend the life of the hair dryer.  Such a thing would cost less than a penny.  This is a huge oversight by the manufacturer.  While the &amp;#34;end cap&amp;#34; may be removed and cleaned it is NOT a filter.  The end cap will not keep dust and lint out of the dryer.  There is a screen underneath the end cap, but it is not removable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the filter out of my last dryer and installed it.  The filter is not paper.  It is plastic.  It is a finer mesh than the mesh on the back of the this dryer but does not reduce the airflow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope the manufacturer reads this:  Please add a removeable filter to your hairdryers.</li>
    <li> I have fine and thin hair and it works just right for me. For less than $20 it meets all my requirements: have cold/warm/hot air, 2 speed settings and has ionic.  I use it on warm setting with high speed, and my hair is dry within a couple of minutes. Love it.</li>
    <li> 3 years later and it still works perfect</li>
    <li> I had to look for a new hair dryer since my old Quiet Con Air hair dryer dies after 5 yrs of service. I have chosen this one because I have read that it blows really hard which is what me and my sister was looking for in this kind of equipment because we both have thick long fine hair. It takes us half day to let our hair dry by itself. This one dries our hair fast. The temperature settings were just right for our hair. I hope this will last longer than my old one. It was a little lighter than what I had but same quietness.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It dries my hair quickly.  Not too loud either.  It is very light weight too.  The paint is already chipped and it was only bought a month ago.  Highest and warmest setting may be too much for fragile hair, but is great for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I was not sure about purchasing this dryer because of the low price.  I am so glad I did. The finger diffuser for my curls is totally what I wanted.  It lifts and gives great volume to my long hair.  I recommend this for all hair styles, well worth the money.    Shirley in Florida</li>
    <li> I have curly hair, so I use the diffuser and this works great.  The only thing that did take some getting used to is the position of the buttons get in the way of my fingers.  Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical, because I have fine hair, and many reviews state it&#x27;s not for fine hair, HOWEVER, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hairdryer.  It is AWESOME on my fine hair.  Yes, the buttons are right at your fingertips, so you do have to pay attention, but I don&#x27;t know where else they would put the buttons.  Once you get used to it, your fingers do not tend to push the buttons accidentally.  It gets very hot on the hot setting, and just as the button indicates, it&#x27;s warm on the warm setting.  I have fine hair, and I used it on HOT.  When I want to straighten my hair, I used the attachment to direct the heat to a certain area; when I wear it curly, I used the diffuser.  Someone had mentioned in an earlier review that the attachments are not included; THEY ARE INCLUDED.  I got a diffuser, and a directional attachment.  It is light weight, NOT TOO LOUD, and all around perfect.  If it ever tears up, I will get the exact same thing as a replacement.</li>
    <li> Good product but the lowest blow level still too high for some.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair frizzy and did not dry well at all.  Worst of all, within three months it started making a loud humming noise, and burn out.  I would never recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> This is the first ionic dryer I have used so don&#x27;t have a strong comparison. I have been using my $15 dryer from 2000 and finally upgraded my dryer. However, immediately I noticed that it did shortened the time drying my hair and my hair is sleeker and smoother. There are less flyaways. Love it, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is a great value.  It cost about $20 and dries my hair faster than my last dryer.  It is lightweight, has a large, diffuser, and has actually eliminated the frizz in my bangs.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive dryer.</li>
    <li> For the price, I think this dryer is great. I like to wear my hair straight and it&#x27;s natural curly, and these attachments are perfect for both those things. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy like some dryers do, and it dries my hair fast! I actually left this while I was on a trip and bought another one right away.</li>
    <li> One of the quieter dryers, but still pretty loud.  Dries fast though.</li>
    <li> I used it couple of times and it isnt drying my hair like before and less weight too. I think I like it.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer, in some reviews people had issues accidentaly turning the dryer off. I have had this problem a couple of times when in a hurry, but it is not very bothersome.  Works great, the diffuser works really well, my old one kept falling off this one attaches better. All in all, good purchase!</li>
    <li> Not the most powerful but OK for men. A woman with thick and long hair won&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Awesome blow dryer for the price!! It takes much less time and less heat to dry my hair. I would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> Works great and has the ability to choose between warm and hot air.</li>
    <li> We bought this from Amazon Dec. 2010 and it just quit Aug. 2011 - not very long in my opinion.  So why are we getting it again?  My wife loved the ability to hit the cool air button and the instant switch from hot to cool air to set her hair, it is light weight, and while it worked, she loved it.  She has fine hair and some reviewers said it wasn&#x27;t the best for those with \\&quot;delicateness\\&quot; in the hair strand arena.  Not a problem I was told.  So because the primary user loves it, the price is reasonable, we are getting another with hope and prayers that it last longer than 8 months.</li>
    <li> It is a good dryer with really hot wind, but the warm wind is gentle so don&#x27;t worry. I like the cool wind to make my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer, it gets very hot though so be careful, my hair turns out shiny and without frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned 2 and would purchase again if it died or I lost it. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer after doing some online research and finding this website ([...]), which rated this as the best value.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I like that it&#x27;s lightweight and can get very hot.  I&#x27;ve always used cheap $10/$15 blow dryers before and they just don&#x27;t dry your hair as fast or style it as well.  I have EXTREMELY thick hair and this blow dryer works quickly and leaves my hear looking sleek.</li>
    <li> It worked well until it would not turn on after a year and a half. I was hoping it would last longer.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I had a bad problem with static electricity in my hair &amp; this works to prevent it.</li>
    <li> i thought this dryer would work better based off the reviews, but i wasn&#x27;t impressed. the only thing i really like about it is it&#x27;s very light weight. i don&#x27;t think it dries any faster than using any other dryers.</li>
    <li> This dryer worked for about six months before the wire connecting to the base melted through and burst into flames in my hand. I had been running it for about 3 minutes at the time it caught on fire. Scary.</li>
    <li> Well, I bought these thinking my old one quit working on me. Turns out my husband turned off a switch that made my sink outlets go out. So, I just went ahead and gave this to my mom for Christmas. She was happy to get it.</li>
    <li> This dryer got better reviews and was less expensive than the one my stylist recommended so I bought it.  I like it a lot except for the placement of the on/off switch on the handle.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s easy to turn it off accidentally while using it.</li>
    <li> I own this hair dryer.  I rarely write reviews but feel compelled to for this one due to the way I ended up on this product page.  My old trusty dryer died after 8 years and I took this Revlon RV544PKF out of my sons&#x27; bathroom (it&#x27;s the family/dog bath//guest/back-up hair dryer) and started using it.  It is so loud I have to be very careful and wear ear plugs each time I use it, but it does dry hair well.  So fast forward and now I am doing an internet search to find a QUIET hair dryer--one that won&#x27;t ruin my hearing!--and THIS one comes up in some beauty magazine and links here.  Don&#x27;t trust most of the stuff you read on the internet, folks--this one is super loud and will damage your ears.  If you are looking for a quiet dryer, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Works well and is very light weight.  Doesn&#x27;t drug my long hair as quickly as I had hoped but overall is a nice  dryer</li>
    <li> Things I love about this dryer...it&#x27;s lightweight, fairly quiet, has hot, warm and cool settings, and it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.  Unfortunately, at 9 months, mine developed an exceptionally loud buzzing noise that makes me feel I&#x27;m going to go deaf using it, so I&#x27;m replacing it.  I hate to replace a hair dryer at just 9 months, but thankfully it&#x27;s very inexpensive!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item 3 times within the last few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one gave out after 4-5 years. I was happy with how long it held up for, and decided to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second one (purchased on Amazon), lasted 6 months. The hairdryer started to smoke one morning (while plugged in). There were a few sparks that came out, and it stopped working after I turned the hair dryer off and back on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third one (also purchased from Amazon), lasted a mere 3 months. The same issue occurred (as above), occured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was unable to get a refund, since it was past the 30-day window. I will not be purchasing this item again.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this hairdryer. It is fast, effective, and leaves my hair feeling super soft.  I especially appreciate how quickly it dries my hair, as I have very long hair and it usually takes a while. Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This was my first Tourmaline hair dryer. So I can&#x27;t compare it with anything. I have thick middle-eastern hair that gets frizzy when I blow-dry it. But I was very happy with this dryer until the fan stopped working after 10 months gentle use (twice a week).    Pros:   ----------  - It gets very hot (you can burn your hand if you touch your hair after drying it with this dryer). So it dries hair very fast.   - It&#x27;s light-weight.   - It was much quieter than my previous Revlon dryer, before the fan started making loud noises.    - It left my hair silky and very soft.   Cons:  ----------  - Stopped working after 10 months gentle use (at most twice a week)!  - It&#x27;s too long to use with the diffuser attachment on your own hair, unless you have very long arms!   - The heat melted the concentrator attachment after a few months. Hopefully it didn&#x27;t ruin my hair.   - Due to its length, it&#x27;s hard to fit into your suitcase; something you might want to consider if you travel a lot like I do.   Over all, I won&#x27;t buy this again. I&#x27;m going to try something else this time. (I had bought mine from Walgreens, but it was the same product and for the same price.)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works very well for me. It is very affordable and comes with extra attachments if needed for added styling.</li>
    <li> I purchased the dryer after reading all those great revues. And I&#x27;m absolutely happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s very light, and it&#x27;s really important for me as my hair drys very much slower, comparing to other people I know. The dryer is also very powerful. In other words I purchased I really good dryer for a really affordable price, I&#x27;m more than happy.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement for my hairdryer that was dying and price was right.</li>
    <li> Began working intermittingly after only 8 months of use.  The issue is a loose connection in the cord brought on when you hang the dryer from the tab on the handle.  Hanging it this way causes the cord to bend in a way that must, over time, loosen the connection inside the dryer. I&#x27;m stretching out its life by using electrical tape to reinforce the cord position but the dryer clearly has a design flaw.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer at this price!  It&#x27;s bigger than I expected from the picture, which is good.  Totally worth buying! I love it.</li>
    <li> Great blow drier. It seems to dry my hair quicker than other blow driers, and doesn&#x27;t seems to be causing much damage. It is also very lightweight. This is such a steal!</li>
    <li> Affordable. Sturdy. I don&#x27;t really have a use for the bigger nozzle extension. I have fine sensitive hair and it work very fast. The cool shot helps closing the hair cuticles.</li>
    <li> This dryer was awesome - until it just stopped working five months after I bought it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a hair dryer in a long time.  This hair dryer is great.  Lightweight and does an excellent job drying your hair.</li>
    <li> Works well, dries my hair about as fast as I could hope for.</li>
    <li> Everything I wanted, quiet, great diffuser, lightweight.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed by this dryer immediately after purchase. For such an inexpensive dryer it did an excellent job drying my thick wavy hair. The dryer is lightweight and dries fast. The issue is that this week about 3 months after my purchase the dryer stopped working. It sounds like it is the motor as it sort of turns on for 5 seconds and then dies out. Since the dryer is cheap it looks like I will just be tossing it in the trash and looking for a better quality longer lasting dryer. I knew it was too good to be true. Only purchase this dryer if you want a disposable short term option.</li>
    <li> All the other reviews were spot on! I&#x27;m kinda picky about my hair tools and this one has got it goin&#x27; on! It promises smoothing and fast drying.  It does both!  My thick, coarse hair was smooth enough after drying with no additonal products that my curling iron slipped right through.  The diffuser and concentrator are well made, not cheap and flimsy.  The filter area on the back is accessible and will be easy to clean!</li>
    <li> I like it and it does work great but I miss my tigi bed head blow drier that died. This is a very lightweight hair dryer and i thought it wouldnt work great but it does a fine job.</li>
    <li> It came in a timely way exactly as advertised.  Somehow, I was expecting it to be hotter and more powerful than it is, it is adequate and i&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
    <li> When I received the box I was worried about how light weight it was. The only thing lightweight about this blow dryer is the number of pounds and ounces.  It is easy to handle and so fast!  My drying time is cut in half and I seem to get lots more volume with my fine hair.  I am happy with every heat setting and do not find the hot too hot.  It is worth way more than the price they are selling for.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> dries quickly, static reduced</li>
    <li> Product much lighter weight and does not have the power of other dryers.</li>
    <li> I bought it on April 20,2015 and I loved it. On May 27, 2015, I went to use it and it sounded funny and there was a burning smell. Unfortunately, I had to return it by May 22 so I am screwed. Very disappointing. Toni</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve owned!     I have long, very thick hair, so I usually only dry my bangs and air-dry the rest; drying and styling my whole head can take more than 30 minutes. This dryer has shortened my drying and styling time to under 10 minutes, fresh out of the shower. It&#x27;s also lightweight, so my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired holding it. One thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how great my hair would look and feel afterward; usually, after drying, my hair is coarse and wavy and I have to take a flat iron to it. After using the ionic dryer, my hair is smooth and shiny; no need for the straightener!</li>
    <li> Good quality, fast shipment, no issues.</li>
    <li> First, this dryer is very light weight and easy to use.  It dries my very thick hair in less than half the time others dryers have in the past.  NO FRIZZ!!!  I have naturally curly hair and this dryer (with the Diffuser attached) simply dried my hair without leaving my hair frizzy for days.  I wish I would&#x27;ve bought this years ago.  I also like the variable temperature settings - more options than on most dryers.  I would recommend this product to anyone who cares about whether they are frying their hair or not.  Plus, I ordered this while deployed in Afghanistan and it got here within a week from the states!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased my own Revlon hair dryer about 1.5 years ago.   It&#x27;s so lightweight and easy to use.  My mom, who is a very picky person, wanted to try it because I keep saying great things about it.  She tried it one time...and told me to buy her another one!  It&#x27;s a steal for something this good under 20 dollars!  I would definitely recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer I&#x27;ve owned. It is extremely lightweight, as listed, and dries hair quickly. Great product at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> Extremely quiet compared to the wife&#x27;s earlier models, but she says it dries the same if not better.  Would highly recommend this to any one looking for a new one.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer recently died on me.  After reading through reviews, I purchased this one.  I am amazed at how fast it dries my hair.  I have super static hair that&#x27;s especially bad in the winter.  This definitely helped calm the static.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer a lot. A few years ago I purchased this hair dryer after reading great reviews. The reviewers were right because it is a great hair dryer. I started getting a short in the cord so I felt the need to replace it. I really like this particular model of hair dryer because I purchased the same model to replace my shorted cord one. It works great for drying my long curly hair with the included diffuser. If I want to straighten my hair the directed air attachment(what is it called?) is awesome for that. It is a great hair dryer and it works. What more can you ask?</li>
    <li> After spending over $50 bucks every 6 months on a new blow dryer- I found this one! I have the curliest hair ever, and I blow dry every day for 30-40 minutes... This blow dryer not only has outlasted the rest, but has also been THE HOTTEST by far that Ive had.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I really like that it is very lightweight. It dries my hair quickly, and leaves less frizz than my last one did. I haven&#x27;t tried the adapters for it yet, but I like the two different speeds. It&#x27;s simple and just what I needed to quickly do my hair in the morning.</li>
    <li> Shorted out the first time I used it! Which BTW wad a tad bit frightening. My hair is long and blows around. It seemed like it was working well. but about half way into my first blow dry, it sucked a piece of hair into the hinged end cap and zapped the hair and shorted out the highest speed.  The hinged end cap that sucks in air is slotted and WAY TOO BIG. It seems like a design flaw.  I had the old version of this blow dryer and it had little holes at the end which do eventually get clogged with lint but at least you and your hair are safe!</li>
    <li> I had one hair dryer for 20 years and since then I have been going through one a year. This is the best yet. Leaves hair with nice shine and soft. Last 2 I bought left hair fried and dull after first few uses. Daily use now for 4 months or so and still works great. Unfortunately can&#x27;t expect to get that 20 years out of anything anymore. 1-2 years would be great on a 20 dollar hair dryer I think.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer while it works. Now, after 11 months of daily use, it no longer blows hot. I expect a hair dryer to last longer. Too bad. On the other hand, 11 months for $20.00 may be reasonable. Something to think about...</li>
    <li> UPDATE 2017/03/20: I bought 3 of these. 2 died after a few months due to poor wiring quality in these Revlon dryers.  I switched to a much better dryer, xtava Allure Supreme 2200W, and it is well worth a little bit more money.  The quality of the xtava is WAY ahead of this Revlon.  Original review: Wow, so much better than my Conair &amp;#34;euro&amp;#34; dryer. This RV544PKF is so powerful and less noisy; we bought one for each bathroom in the house.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is my first official review. I bought this dryer about 7 months ago. Other than the concentrator/nozzle melting a bit, it worked great. Seven months later it stopped working. I&#x27;ve never had a blow dryer die on me so quick! Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace a goody hair dryer that had a 3 year warranty and began shooting out flaming chunks after 13 months.  I have shorter hair, so drying time isn&#x27;t a real problem with any dryer. My main issue is the excessive noise some of them have.  Sounds like an airport runway in my bathroom.  Really wish they were required to note the decibel levels on the package.&lt;br /&gt;This model has a very acceptable noise level and doesn&#x27;t have that high pitched whine that some do.&lt;br /&gt;Drys my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> good for the price. it works. standard head works well but i don&#x27;t know how the large head works.</li>
    <li> This dryer is quiet, lightweight, and cuts your dry time down. It made my hair straighter, shinier, and softer that with my previous dryer. I couldn&#x27;t believe my hair looked that improved by simply changing my dryer! I should have done it sooner!</li>
    <li> Extremely noisy on high.  Blew the circuit on High and HOT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using it, so it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
    <li> I am meticulous about reading reviews and after the great reviews I read about this dryer I decided to go with it. It dries my long hair in no time at all. It has two heat settings, warm and hot as well as a cold shot button. I love that the concentrator attachment does not fall off easily but it still can be maneuvered up and sideways depending on how you are holding the dryer. I use the hot setting and it does not damage my hair what so ever. It is a really great dryer. It is light and the cord is long enough for you to use without incident. I would recommend this to anyone!    UPDATE: A few weeks ago I was drying my hair as usual when the hairdryer sparked what looked like fireworks on the fourth of July and started smoking. I was totally freaked out and somewhat angry, so I emailed the Revlon customer service and asked about a warranty. Within a day or so I received a phone call from Helen of Troy, the company that produces the dryer asking if I was okay and which model I had. Without question they had FedEx-ed me a brand new hair dryer in 2 business days. I was really impressed with their customer service. I am sure I just had a faulty dryer, I still use mine every other day and it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I bought this nov 15, 2014. Today it caught on fire! I heard a pop and a spark came from the cord (right where it meets the hair dryer). After the spark, it flared into a flame. I was ridiculously frightened. I dont think my husband really believed me until the smoke set off the fire alarm. I see now that several other reviewers have had the same experience and that I am lucky to have avoided a burn. I wrote to revlon and they blame Helen of Troy (the manufacturer). This is no joke. This deserves a class action suit! Stop selling this product!</li>
    <li> I love this drier. Not only does it dry my hair, which I have a ton of, faster than any drier I&#x27;ve ever used before, but it also leaves my hair very soft and silky, rather than fried. It is lightweight and surprisingly quiet! I haven&#x27;t played with any of the attachments yet, but I can&#x27;t wait to!     My only negative comment is that the on/off switch is in the exact place where my hand holds the drier, so I keep inadvertently turning it off. Not a big deal for me, but if you get irritated easily with your appliances, it might matter.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t purchase this hair dryer soon! It is less hot and not as loud as my old hair dryer, yet it dries my hair 2-3x faster! I save so much time in the mornings and for the price, this hair dryer is a total steal!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for - a dryer that won&#x27;t blast your eardrums.  It&#x27;s much quieter than most dryers and powerful too.  A good buy!</li>
    <li> I love this staff .I heard is works ,I had use before ,Is cheaper ,good quality&#x27;you have to have it</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is everything it&#x27;s advertised to be: lightweight, efficient, and with the diffuser it dries my wavy hair faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before, without making it frizzy.  My hair normally takes forever to dry, and often gets frizzy too, so this is an amazing find.  I can&#x27;t even believe the price.</li>
    <li> I have REALLY, REALLY thick hair.  To dry my hair in the past I would blow dry the top for about 20 minutes then go sit or do chores and let it air dry for at last 30 minutes.  Then if I really needed it dried all the way, which I rarely did, I went back for 20 more minutes under the dryer.  My sister in-law said she got a great hair dryer at Christmas for over $100.  Well 1, I will never spend that much on a hair dryer and 2, I don&#x27;t have the money to spend over $100 on a hair dryer!!  My daughter \\&quot;suffers\\&quot; from the same hair as me.  So between the two of us we can&#x27;t dry our hair within an hour at the same time.  Well, with this hairdryer I was able to dry my daughter&#x27;s hair in literally 5 minutes.  I timed it.  I was able to dry my hair in 8 minutes!!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  This is the most amazing hair dryer I have ever owned or used!!  It is light weight and the buttons are easy to use with one hand.  I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this hair dryer!!</li>
    <li> I have really thick curly hair and it takes forever to dry normally and most dryers tend to leave my hair frizzy. After using the Revlon RV544 my hair looks shiny and healthy and it doesn&#x27;t take a long time. Another plus is that it truly is light weight and doesn&#x27;t make my arm tired.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, just as advertised. I feel noticeable smoothness in my hair after using it. Also, it dries very fast. Don&#x27;t care too much for the heat diffuser attachment because my hair isn&#x27;t thick enough to benefit from it. Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy if she is happy.  She has long thick hair, and she feels this drier works well and quickly.  I can&#x27;t comment on how durable it is, but hopefully it will last a few years.</li>
    <li> I have really thick wavy hair and it usually takes at least 30 minutes to dry it.  By the time I&#x27;m done, it&#x27;s dried, but frizzy from being exposed to the heat for so long.  This dryer, with the diffuser attatched, literally dries my hair in under 5 minutes.  I was stunned. Not only is my hair dry, but waves keep their shape and the frizzies are gone.  I love this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Excellent hair drier.  My hair is completely dried and straightened in 5 min.</li>
    <li> I had my old blow dryer for 16 years... This was such a welcome change!!!  My favorite part is that it has a cool, warm and hot setting.  The hot on my old dryer was always too much for my daughter but she didn&#x27;t like the cool setting.  This is perfect for her on the warm setting. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Reasons why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s VERY lightweight. I hadn&#x27;t replaced my hair dryer in many years, and this is a noticeable improvement. It&#x27;s also nice because it won&#x27;t take up much weight in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The attachments actually fit OVER the nozzle instead of clipping right inside, so they actually stay in place. I had a previous hair dryer where the diffuser fit into the inside rim of the nozzle, and it kept falling out all the time. These attachments fit over the nozzle and are very sturdy, so no more worrying about the diffuser falling off when you&#x27;re drying your hair upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The hot setting is REALLY hot, and the cold setting is actually cold. Not true with all hair dryers, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a decent hair dryer that is simple to use and does what it is suppose to do. Drying hair is not complicated and it does that. In the hand it feels top heavy but that is a minor complaint. The two speeds and temp controls are all I needed. The problem is the quality. The warranty is for two years and Revlon will replace it for $5 when you ship it back to them. So if I spend $12 to return it and include $5 to cover the return shipping I will have saved $3 under the Amazon price. I doubt if they get many returns. This one was purchased 54 weeks ago and used daily by my wife, so it barely made it half way through the warrantiy period. Without the $5 charge then a return might be in order.  I won&#x27;t buy another Revlon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this model for a few years and love it. Just bought this one for my mom. Good quality, a few different settings, &amp; easy to clean lint filter.</li>
    <li> Lightweight. Fully met my expectations. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This thing has power!  The first time I used it, it tripped my bathroom&#x27;s 15-amp circuit breaker that is shared with a 5-bulb light fixture with compact fluorescents.  That never happened with my old dryer, a Vidal Sassoon QuietStyler 1875.  I didn&#x27;t experiment a lot because it&#x27;s a long walk to the breaker box in the garage, but I assume the lower power setting wouldn&#x27;t blow the breaker.     I based my choice on users&#x27; reviews of this dryer.  I wanted three features and got one of them.    I wanted a light-weight dryer and it IS light.    I wanted quiet.  Several reviews said it was, but it is quite a bit louder than my old Sassoon.    I wanted the fast-drying that several reviewers praised.  I haven&#x27;t timed it, but I don&#x27;t sense that it dries my (thick, medium-length) hair faster than the old one.</li>
    <li> What I like about this product is that it&#x27;s super light. Very easy to hold over your head without getting tired.  However,  I don&#x27;t think it dries as quickly as my old hairdryer.  I like the cool blast setting for setting hair in place. I would buy again, just takes a couple extras minutes to dry.</li>
    <li> I loved my dryer, it worked great on drying my hair while leaving it soft and shining. However, after 4 months of daily use it broke down on me. I know it&#x27;s probably just the fuse, but I&#x27;ve had other dryers at a must lower quality rating that lasted for years. Thankfully I still have one of those old goodies as a back-up kicking around so I was at least able to finish drying my hair this morning. A \\&quot;good\\&quot; product like this from Revlon should prove to be of better quality; I&#x27;m very disappointed and will be looking to probably pay extra for something that will actually be good quality. While I would still recommend this type of hair dryer, I would not recommend this model to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great little hair dryer ... Given as a Christmas Present.  My wife loves it.  It has a super price for such a good hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. My daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer twice since purchasing and it&#x27;s done a very decent job so far. I have dreadlocks which hold a lot of water after washing so, I needed something powerful that could completely dry my hair or come as close to that as possible. This dryer satisfies my needs,it&#x27;s powerful and even with long hair I do not need to use it at the highest settings to get good results. At the highest setting it&#x27;s very bearable and not uncomfortably hot to the ears or other parts of the face. However,if you have clips or some other metal item in your hair those can get very hot and that can be a bit painful. As long as you focus the dryer on your hair it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with the dryer is the placement of the control buttons. Based on the way that I have to hold the dryer I&#x27;m either turning it off or changing the settings while I&#x27;m using it which is a bit of a nuisance. I know that most dryers are like this but I&#x27;ve never had a problem like this one before. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the style of the buttons but they switch very easily, which can be a good thing when starting it up but can be a problem while in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all for the price it&#x27;s an excellent dryer.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace a tourmaline hair dryer I bought a year ago at a beauty supply store.  I found reviews for this Revlon dryer put it on par with dryers three times as expensive.  I had my doubts but it really lived up to it&#x27;s claims.  It is powerful enough to straighten out my curly hair and it did so without causing damage to my hair.  It is also light as a feather, which is a plus compared to the heavy monstrosities I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The only negative is that it has a very short power cord but that I can work with.  I&#x27;m actually considering buying the travel version.</li>
    <li> Burnt out quickly because I guess it got backed up with gunk</li>
    <li> I love it! It drys my hair faster than my last dryer and it makes it nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> had no issues while using it. eventually blew out while I was using it. started steaming and saw sparks.</li>
    <li> Have had this dryer for a number of months now and still works great - really nice for the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hairdryers in my life that lasted and lasted. I bought this one in summer 2007 as it seemed with more modern technology and also has a distributor. I used it every morning for about 10 minutes and have more or less shoulder long hair. About last fall I noticed that it didn&#x27;t blow with the same energy anymore, and as others have reported some sparks and hot wires appeared. Now it finally died completely. Since I use it little in summer I got about 3.8 years out of mine for daily use, considered that some users reported a life span of less than that I gave it 3 stars. In the first 3 years it worked very well, then slowly declined until dead. I do not like to through away electrical appliances all the time and would expect a hair dryer to last longer, but I guess one cannot expect that anymore from a basic dryer. Will now significantly upgrade and order a Solano professional dryer.</li>
    <li> Quit and the settings give me lot of options for me and the kids!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is an excellent value for the money.   From what I understand consumer reports also found this dryer to be a good value.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed if you choose to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Definitely recommended. I purchased this dryer for my wife and it works nice. She has the last dryer from Revlon which lasted 3 years, and I am hoping same from this one.</li>
    <li> Works great and light weight. I bought from the slightly damaged and only had one scratch. Not a big deal. Very happy.!</li>
    <li> Lasted less than a year</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s light weight, it&#x27;s powerful, it&#x27;s not too loud.  Very good buy.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if the whole \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; thing was BS or not, but I have to say --- this dries my hair much faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve owned (I have pretty thick hair), and it does make my hair shiney.  All the other hair dryers I&#x27;ve had made my hair look all dried out and gave it fly-aways.  Not this one.  And it&#x27;s reasonably priced.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price, would recommend. Diffuser is a great bonus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several hair dryers. Expensive and inexpensive and this is by far the best hair dryer ive ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This really is one of the most light-weight full-size hairdryers I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have had trouble finding a hair dryer with enough power to dry my long hair quickly without also weighing fifty pounds.  This dryer is SO easy to hold up I could dry the hair of everyone in my family without my arm getting tired.  And it dries my hair very quickly.    There is one annoying problem though.  The controls are positioned on the handle in such a way that it is almost impossible to not accidentally turn it off, or switch from hot to warm without meaning to.  This seriously needs to be re-designed.  But I still like everything else about it so much I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
    <li> Light weight, easy to use and does the job very well...I would not hesitate to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have had this blow dryer 2 years but hardly ever blow dry my hair since its short and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like all the other 1 star reviews, my cord broke right where it connects.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer because it had so many positive reviews and seemed like a good bargain.  Once using it, I was not impressed.  It leaves my hair feeling frizzy, not smooth like higher quality dryers.  At this point, I still figured it was worth it given the low price.  However, almost exactly 1 year after buying it, it stopped working.  Perhaps I have unrealistic expectations, but I had hoped it would last longer.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I was looking for something that will dry my hair fast. I am always in a rush in the morning going to work, but I can&#x27;t leave my hair looking and feeling damp. This one does the job perfectly. This is a great hair dryer</li>
    <li> I purchased this blowdryer in November of last year and it just failed - it didn&#x27;t even last a year and it shorted out! I thought it was great and lightweight while it worked, however I can&#x27;t believe it didn&#x27;t last longer than 9 months.</li>
    <li> powerful and quiet.  great!</li>
    <li> Surprised at good value of Revlon Ionic Dryer. I have long fine hair, dries my hair in three minutes. Really like cool button feature for bringing out shine.</li>
    <li> I love this thing because the kids stay in their own bathroom in the morning!  Seriously, it works very well and and is light weight. Well worth the price and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight almost too lightweight.  Seems cheap but it works.  I just use regular attachment not diffuser.  I have really thick hair and drying time is average.</li>
    <li> This is the best value anywhere. Excellent product at low price.</li>
    <li> This item works great and dries my hair very quickly.  The attachments it comes with make staying my hair easier.</li>
    <li> After working at home for two years, I took a job downtown and had to learn to get ready in a hurry.  My other blow dryer was hot, but the air flow seemed moderate.  I wanted something that would dry fast, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.  This is an excellent dryer for the money and performs similarly to dryers that cost more than $150.  It drys super-fast and does not seem to damage the hair.  My hair looks full and shiny and it gets the job done in about five minutes.  Gotta love it!</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little while now, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it at all. It dries my hair quickly, and I have very long, thick hair. I use the targeted nozzle, I haven&#x27;t tried the diffuser yet, because I prefer my wavy hair be straight. Overall I am very pleased with my blow dryer and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement for the hair dryer that I had for a few years. I was skeptical about buying a new one, because I really liked me old one. I bought this on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and I love it! The hot setting is great, and if it gets too hot, the warm setting is perfect.... Great buy!</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for less than 6 months and today a coil inside started to catch on fire and spit out flames that almost caught my hair on fire!  I plan to contact Revlon and voice my concern over their very dangerous appliance!  Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this hair dryer a long time ago and never thought of writing a review until now. The item is several years old and still holding up well. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> after reading plenty of reviews on amazon and on other websites, i decided to purchase this hair dryer.  i wanted something that dried my hair quickly, but had this new fangled tourmaline gem thing, as well as something ionic or ceramic for even heating. i dry my hair with a dryer every time i wash it, so any features that decrease chances of me frying my hair are a plus. i usually go for conair, but this dryer has gotten a lot of positive reviews, so i went for revlon this time!  1. dries quickly, but no scalding! i have thick asian hair and have been using 1875 watt dryers for at least a decade (how else can i dry my hair under an hour?). it does tend to get pretty toasty, as some other reviews noted, but it&#x27;s not more than other hairdryers i&#x27;ve owned. i never keep it in one spot, nor do i think you&#x27;re supposed to, so burning myself hasn&#x27;t been an issue at all.  the cord doesn&#x27;t get hot during use. (i checked after i finished drying my hair.)  also, the barrel doesn&#x27;t get very hot, either.  immediately after using it, i felt the barrel and it was relatively cool.  i could probably hold onto it while styling.  2. noise level.  honestly, it&#x27;s not that much quieter than my last dryer before it broke, but i think the last one was designed to be quiet, too. (i&#x27;ve had it for a while so i don&#x27;t remember) also, it&#x27;s a different kind of loud.  it is definitely not as loud as some other hair dryer&#x27;s i&#x27;ve tried, so i would consider it quiet... especially on the lower settings.  the loudness mainly comes from the amount of air blowing through, which is not as bad.  it&#x27;s bad when a dryer is loud because the fan has that high machine whine or sounds like a lawn mower.  this one is just a lot of air whooshing through.  3. weight. Definitely light!! love it.  4. attachments. sorry, i don&#x27;t really use them, but they seem like your typical diffuser and concentrator.  5. the tourmaline/ionic thing. works great as far as i can tell! my hair feels super soft after i use it! it feels light.  also, not to be gross, but it doesn&#x27;t make my head all sweaty after i use it, either.  haven&#x27;t used it during the summer yet, but it&#x27;s been better than my last dryer at that!  i&#x27;ve never really used any of the expensive dryers, so i can&#x27;t compare, but for this price range, it&#x27;s definitely a five-star! hope it lasts as long as my last one :)</li>
    <li> This hairdryer was a steal for twenty bucks!!  I definitely feel like I&#x27;m using a dryer worth a lot more.  My *thick*, wavy hair dries much faster now than with previously owned dryers.  All the settings work as expected, including the cool setting (a first for me - they seem to usually just be decoration with no real function.)  I would purchase this again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Quality is so so. The design is a little strange since the Off is the middle switch which makes it uncomfortable to turn off easily.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife after doing some research.  I love it because she does!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this since February 2009. I clean the lint off from time-to-time with the brush, that&#x27;s the only maintenance I do. Two of us use this dryer daily....I&#x27;ve never had any hair dryer work this many years before conking out on me. Occasionally I have to push the reset but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. Mine has never sparked nor had any funny burning smells like others state. I also don&#x27;t wrap the cord on this so maybe that contributes to the longevity.  I love the heat settings and the ionic part of this helps my blonde hair become a little more shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: November 2015, found this was on sale so I purchased a back-up in case the 6-1/2 year old dryer ever quits.</li>
    <li> I moved to the US so bought this to replace my T3 hairdryer that I left in the uk. So far I am very pleased with the hairdryer it is very light and dries my hair quickly. I am no expert but my T3 did not seem to produce noticably better results and was certainly not worth at least 5 times the cost if not more. As long as the hairdryer lasts at least a couple of years I will be very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this hair dryer. It works well on my hair as well as the dog&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> works great and the price is so reasonable</li>
    <li> Seems to be great so far, I have used this hair dryer 3 times and it makes my hair so smooth. I didnt even have to straighten it! It also cut my drying time in half.  So far for the price I can&#x27;t complain, very happy!</li>
    <li> First one came DOA but they made it pretty simple to send it back and get a new one in days. Regardless, it&#x27;s still a decent little dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for a while now, and it works great! The air speed is not quite as fast as an old one I had, but my water-loving hair still dries quickly. I have also noticed a significant increase in volume when I use this one (compared to my other dryer)! The ions really do make a difference! Completely happy with this dryer!</li>
    <li> I was surprised how lightweight this really is.  It also dries my hair very quickly without the intense  heat of other driers I have owned. Highly recommend this item and the price is right!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, naturally wavy, fine hair (but I have a ton of it), and this dryer (with diffuser attachment) manages my waves without blasting them all over the place.  The hot setting works perfectly without scorching my hair or scalp.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The hairdryer works well.  I like the power and heat control to dry my hair.  It works as expected.  I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times and always happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer works wonderfully, came in good time and condition. The &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button doesn&#x27;t seem to work, but I haven&#x27;t yet read the directions- I just started right in using it! Overall, I&#x27;m pleased!!!</li>
    <li> It met my expectations and exceeded it in some cases. With my old dryer I would take about 15 to 20 minutes to get my hair dry with this one i am done in 10 minutes flat that is really great for me especially when i am rushing to get to work.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair dryer when I bought it -- didn&#x27;t give me the frizz, dried quickly, my thick hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz was more smooth -- much better than the Conair it replaced. However, I noticed the motor making a funny sound, first just on \\&quot;high\\&quot;, but now on all speeds and temperatures, and it&#x27;s not getting hot any more. I came here to buy another one, so I looked up my previous order, and it was only January 2011. Hair dryers shouldn&#x27;t die that quickly. So thankfully I had the old Conair in another bathroom, and will use that until I figure out what to get next.  I&#x27;d love to recommend it, but I consider a one-year failure rate too high.</li>
    <li> I like using the diffuser on my hair because my hair is kind of long. This dryer just takes up to 15 minutes to completely dry my hair. I can go to work with sleek and straight hair. The best dryer for me.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It performs as expected. However, I have used it 2-3 times a week  for 2.5 years and it just caught fire where the cord attaches to the hair dryer. A bit scary but will definitely be replacing it with another just like it.</li>
    <li> I read great reviews about this dryer, and those reviewers weren&#x27;t wrong!  I have been very pleased with how fast it dries my hair, how lightweight it is, and how my hair doesn&#x27;t seem as damaged now.  This dryer is quite the bargain.</li>
    <li> the wind is strong and hot when you turn it on, of course it can be switched to low/warm wind. I like it.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. I prefer the stronger output of my Conair Infinity Pro, but it&#x27;s twice as much.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair that takes forever to dry.  I love this hair dryer! It is light and has really shortened drying time.  I bought it based on other reviews and it didn&#x27;t disappoint. Please consider this before you spend a lot of money for the same results.  This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife as her old hair dryer had given up the ghost.  She did the research and told me which one she wanted.  This new one (in her words) \\&quot;does a good job and is quieter\\&quot; than her old one.  She is pleased with it.    By the way, we purchased this through our local PBS station website so a portion of the purchase amount gets donated to our favorite radio station at no additional cost to us.  Thanks Amazon for supporting Public Radio!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, wavy, shoulder length hair. I am a low maintenance type of person and I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of effort on my hair, but I also don&#x27;t want it to look crazy and unkept. I have always hated blow drying, but it is a necessary evil. Before I bought this blow dryer, I&#x27;d had the same one for years and I thought it did all right. However, this one blows my old one out of the water. It packs a lot of power. I am amazed by how quickly it gets my hair dry. For this review I timed myself and it took less than five minutes. I need to emphasize that I have a lot of hair. All of my life, stylists have commented on it and said that I have enough for two people. I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for about five months, and as long as it continues to perform at its current level I will be a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair dryer with a nozzle and this was great. I purchased it because of the other good reviews and was not disappointed. I feel like it dries my hair quicker than my old hair dryer. I also like that it&#x27;s light so my arms don&#x27;t get tired.</li>
    <li> There you go again amazon.com - giving me something good!!!  I love that this is not heavy - when you get older holding a heavy hairdryer is not good for the wrists and/or arms.  This works as stated in the description - simple as that!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this hair dryer, but after about 9 months it has started shorting out. I have to hold the cord at a certain angle every morning to get it to work. I will buy a new hairdryer and will try another one in hopes of it working more than 9 months.</li>
    <li> It dries your hair, what can you say.  I actually like the big diffuser though I wish they would put rubber tips on it so it doesn&#x27;t hurt to rub it along your scalp.  Would be nice to give the scalp a massage.  I actually don&#x27;t think the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting is as hot as other same wattage driers.  At least it doesn&#x27;t seem to be.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any speedier drying than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve had and I can&#x27;t speak to whether the ion hullaballoo actually works.  My hair doesn&#x27;t seem any shinier.  It&#x27;s fairly large, takes up a bit of room in carry on luggage.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new hair dryer, but I didn&#x27;t need one with all the styling gadgets. I just wanted one to dry my hair.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I see a big difference in the way my hair looks and feels after it has been dried with this dryer.  The dryer leaves my long, fine hair smooth and silky. I did not see any decrease in drying time, however.  That is why I only gave it 4 stars.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly light and quiet.</li>
    <li> Fairly quiet and light.  Hair not as frizzy after using as I&#x27;ve had with other dryers.  Very please with purchase.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has some nice features and it worked well for my wife for about two years, but then it died.  We bought a second one at that point and that was a couple of months ago and so far, so good.  I know that everything is made in China these days and that quality has gone by the wayside, but I remember my mom&#x27;s hair dryer lasting about 20 years...seriously.  We&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts, but two years is pretty pathetic, especially given the fact that the unit was not abused or damaged in any way.  The only thing that I can say is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s priced right, even considering how long it lasted, and my wife is pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer about 5 years ago and use it every morning along with my sister. It still works like its brand new and we&#x27;ve never had a problem with it. The temperature settings let you choose hot, warm, or cold which is nice and the dryer itself isn&#x27;t very loud. I just recently bought another one of these because I am moving out to my own place in a month, and I must say this dryer is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I searched and did ALOT of research before I purchased this hair dryer. There were so many high quality brands at very low prices, but this one stood out. Some of the other brands actually had reviews that said the other dryers \\&quot;caught on fire\\&quot;. I was nervous about purchasing anything. However, I finally purchased this one, and so far, very good. Dries very fast, not heavy and my hair feels sooo smooth whenever I am done drying. Only been a month, but I am very happy with my purchase,</li>
    <li> After looking into several reviews on blow dryers, I learned about the Revlon Tourmaline.  All of the reviews were so positive.  I&#x27;ve been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are.  The placement couldn&#x27;t be better on the controls. The price was right as well!  Blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive.  A very good value.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best dryer I have purchased.  I have thick, long hair and it is a hassle to blow dry and usually the dryer cuts off from over heating at least four times before I&#x27;m finished.  The dryer stayed hot the entire time, never cut off and it took me half the time as usual.      It was a bit too powerful to use on my youngest daughter&#x27;s hair but did wonders on my eldest.     I wish there was a comb attachment but the dryer itself is wonderful!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. First time I use it,  it caused the power circuit to shut off on my brand new house built in 2014</li>
    <li> The hot air wasn&#x27;t too hot or came out strong BUT my hair dried fast and I have a lot of hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> Pros:  Very light weight and drys well with less heat.  Cons:  Very loud... almost ready to get a pair of ear plugs.  Yikes!    Details of Use: The air coming out didn&#x27;t seem to be as hot on low as my old dryer.  However, it does dry quickly and evenly. I have yet to use it on low heat. Just doesn&#x27;t seem hot enough. On high, it&#x27;s a blast of hotter(but not too hot) air and noise.  Great for a person styling someone elses hair the way my stylist does. The air shaft is longer than I&#x27;m used to, so I&#x27;m on a bit of a learning curve with a brush and heavy blast of air trying to curl medium length straight hair to give it body. Cool button is great, but don&#x27;t seem to use it. The buttons are easy to use and have yet to hit one by mistake.    Not sure I would buy again because of noise.  I just use it on low and take a bit longer.  My husband and son now wake up.  Kinda miss that time in a.m. by myself. ;)</li>
    <li> After 3 uses it died:( I really loved it but I can&#x27;t pay 20 dollars every 2 months.</li>
    <li> Bought this in February, and noticed in April there were cracks in the handle. It was used about 3 to 4 times a week, a total of 15 minutes, tops, by a 69-year-old woman. It was not dropped or used to beat a rug. So this is ridiculous. Amazon&#x27;s return policy says I&#x27;ll only get a portion of the cost returned. Maybe I&#x27;ll write to Revlon. I guess I can try duct tape, but I won&#x27;t buy a Revlon hair dryer again.</li>
    <li> used it to replace an expensive chic model.  works better.</li>
    <li> This replaces my old vidal sasson with ionic technology.  I must say that I love this hair dryer.  It works much better than my old one.  I have fine wavy hair that tends to frizz and this really smoothes it out.  Even though my hair is fine I have alot of it and this dries my hair very quickly.  My hair also feels healthier.  Love this dryer and love the price.  I thought about getting an expensive CHI but couldn&#x27;t bear to pay the price.  I am very happy with this dryer and think I can live without the CHI.  I also like the silver color of this dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these in three years. Seems to die on me after about 9-12 months. I only use it once, occasionally twice a week to blow dry my hair straight and it does work well which is why I buy it. I had  conair model before which I spent about $40 on and lasted 10 years but didn&#x27;t straighten my hair as well as this so I continue to buy the revlon. Just wish it lasted longer!</li>
    <li> Seriously doubt the claims that it is Tourmaline, Ionic and Ceramic.  There is not switch for Ionic (as described) and the nozzle is at sort of an odd angle from the handle, not 90 degrees like most hairdryers.  The photo makes it look as if it is but it&#x27;s more like 80 degrees, which makes awkward to direct it at your hair in some positions when using a round brush.  Dosen&#x27;t seem to dry any faster than a non-specialized dryer.  Not my favorite.</li>
    <li> Terrible hair dryer. It stopped working on January 23 and I only had it for 2 months! I dry my hair twice a week. This was a terrible purchase. Spend a little more money on a quality product! The warranty ran out on Dec 20th so I can&#x27;t return it...</li>
    <li> Thought this was a great hair dryer until today when using it I smelled something funny and next thing I know there are flames shooting out of the place where the cord goes into the dryer. Not safe! Too late for a return but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this dryer for any reason!</li>
    <li> I REALLY, REALLY like this hair dryer, but I now have the 3rd one of this same model that is giving me trouble.  I love how hot it gets and the air flow is perfect for medium to thick hair, but since I use it to straighten my hair in sections I am constantly turning the dryer on and off.  With all 3 dryers (the 3rd one started acting up this morning) the switch goes bad and either won&#x27;t come on or only works on the low setting.  If you only turn the dryer on a few times per session then it will likely last you a while, but if you plan to turn it off 15+ times in a drying session, you will probably have the same problem.  On a positive note, this dryer is really cheap so you could buy 6 for the price of those high-end dryers!</li>
    <li> its quiet and light weight.....the cord could be a little longer</li>
    <li> Works great, love it!</li>
    <li> I love my new hair dryer.  This is a vast improvement from my other one which I had had for well over 10 years (may it rest in peace).  Dry time quick and my hair looks/feels shinier from before.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok... for the price, powerful and light.  Not many settings... but a nice simple blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, professional hair dryer!!! It has terrific drying power, you don&#x27;t have to set it&lt;br /&gt;on the &#x27;high&#x27; setting to dry your hair. It holds nicely and is not too heavy. A great purchase!!</li>
    <li> After using this tourmaline dryer the first time, I thought I had forgotten to rinse out my conditioner.  The second and third time using the dryer, I suspected my flat lifeless hair was due to the tourmaline dryer (which it was).  There were other reviews saying this dryer is not for fine hair, and I should have listened.  When I realized it was the tourmaline-type dryer making my hair flat and lifeless, I went to the store and bought a NON-tourmaline dryer and now my hair has its volume and bounce back.</li>
    <li> When I first got them last year they were great as advertised. Inexpensive, light, quiet and dried hair fairly fast but in 6 months one of them shorted and sparks flew out. Then last week the same thing happened to the other one. Definitely not recommended. This is cheaply made and dangerous.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is light weight and quiet.  It dries my short cut very quickly and has more settings than I will ever need or use.  Great price.</li>
    <li> If you have straight hair that you actually do something with stay away from this dryer.  I have short straight hair and this dryer is leave my hair flat and limp!!!  I am definitely returning this dryer.  I will take my chances with my old beloved CHI that has a short in it until my new one is comes.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery and good hair dryer</li>
    <li> This blow dryer, drys my hair real quick within 10 mins. It does get super hot and I would have to cool it a bit so it does not burn my scalp. But love the dryer. Great choice!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick straight hair.  It takes awhile to blow dry, and this dryer works pretty quick to dry my hair.  It&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold.  I like the smaller attachment, works well for straightening and smoothing hair.  I tried the diffuser but don&#x27;t really understand what that is supposed to do for me!</li>
    <li> My Hair Type &amp; History: Thin with long layers, dyed, body waved permed &amp; curled at least every other day to control the frizz, so it&#x27;s pretty damaged looking!    After all what my hair has been through (especially the perm) it&#x27;s a big frizzy mess. I should&#x27;ve never permed my hair. It&#x27;s more maintenance work I&#x27;ll tell ya that. Every time I showered and blow dried my hair, I hated how my hair looked. Super dried and fried, but whenever I leave the salon it&#x27;s shiny, bouncy, light, and smooth. I bought every hair product that my hairstylist used one me (Moroccan Oil &amp; Root pump for volume), and it never looked the same. Then she asked what blow dryer I was using. I said, a cheap $10 Conair. She said, having a good expensive ION TOURMALINE blow dryer would work, so I went home and looked up all the blow dryers with ION TOURMALINE. I came across many expensive brands, but this caught my eye due to the amount of reviews and inexpensive cost! Boy, the reviews weren&#x27;t wrong. Now, my hair is very smooth, super soft (too soft actually), and glad to know that I&#x27;m not damaging my hair even more due to the tourmaline. Also it is very light weight for such a good quality product. Very impressed. Only downside is that, it has made my hair so soft, that I need to add more hair products to give it texture and hold, but I&#x27;m loving it. It is something I can&#x27;t live without, nor would I want to use anything else. I am going to buy one more before they discontinue this!</li>
    <li> Good dryer. I was looking for something to replace my old ionic dryer, which I loved and which (sadly) finally died, and tried out numerous products from different stores and manufacturers. Unfortunately, this one isn&#x27;t quite as powerful as I wanted (ionic dryers just don&#x27;t seem to compare to regular ones), but it&#x27;s the best of the five or six that I tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  My sister has one just like this and I used it for a few months before finally giving in and buying one for myself.  Love it! Dries fast and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace my old and about to die hair dryer  purcahed this based on the reviews.This dryer dries my hair quickly  and doesn&#x27;t dry it up.  Well worth $20</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is awsome. Its only $20 and it does the job right. I have been using this for 5 months now everyday and its still working like brand new. I had bought a different one before and it didnt even last 2 months. This one has awsome quality and its a great price. If your looking for a quality blowdryer for a great price then this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is amazing.  My hair is softer &amp; shinier than it has been in years.  The hairdryer is easy to use and a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lightweight and effective hairdryer.  I borrowed this at my daughters&#x27; house while visiting her and said ... I have to get this for myself.  My hair got finished faster and smoother and my shoulder didn&#x27;t hurt while doing the process.  And such an amazing price!  Kudos to Revlon!</li>
    <li> 20 bucks and a great rating from 400+ ppl. What else is there to say? My old hairdryer cracked after years of use so I hopped onto Amazon and immediately bought this hairdryer after some quick comparisons. It&#x27;s lightweight and dries my hair so quickly due to the tourmaline ionic tech. I only wish my old hairdryer broke sooner! It comes with 2 attachments, the finger diffuser and concentrator. It was a bit hard for me to put the concentrator attachment onto the dryer so I haven&#x27;t messed with it to switch to the diffuser. (For some reason, it took more strength than I thought it would need to attach, it is a very tight fit. and no, i am not a weak woman). Anyway, it dried my hair fast and left it very smooth and sleek. I alternate between hot and warm because sometimes the hot air is a bit too hot on my scalp. Also love the cold air button to set your hair. Easy to use, easy to lift and maneuver. My mom loves it as well, so much that she took it! It looks like I&#x27;m going to have to buy another one! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have curly hair and I wanted a way to dry it without frizzing it. I love the diffsure and the options it gives with heat and strength. It doesn&#x27;t give me perfect curls, so I also use a curling iron to make the curls more presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have had no issues with the dryer itself.</li>
    <li> I bought it in April 2014 and it is July 2015 now. I bought this because of reviewer bragging about its power. Well, honestly,  I did not think this gave off that much power to begin with, but I used it everyday for not much to complain otherwise.  Around march 2015, it started to overheat so quickly and my hair started to feel more dull at the end. I can feel the handle is pooling its heat and I had to turn off several times during my hair drying. I clean dusts from both ends of the dryer, say monthly, if not more often, but it did not do much.  This morning, the dryer sparked right by my ear and it scared the daylight out of me. It was so hot that I thought something bad happened to the skin, but it was just red, nothing else. I ordered other dryer right away and I will pull out my old one from Costco until the new one arrives. I am giving two star for working fine for a while (less than a year), but took 3 star off for its short life.</li>
    <li> This dryer is VERY lightweight, which comes in handy for those of us with difficult hair. I have very curly, wavy, frizzy hair, and it comes out smooth with this dryer and a large round brush. Also, the drying time seems to be cut significantly.  I would guess it works as well as some of the high dollar hair dryers, but at an AWESOME price!</li>
    <li> After researching on line what the best hair dryers were, this model appeared to be the best without spending a small fortune. I found various prices for this model at more than double the price that I paid through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hair dryer. Its very light and it drys my hair in like 5 min. I bought a $300.00 ion dryer and i have to say I like this Revlon dryer better. I read the reviews and i decided to try it. I have to admit, maybe because i read so many reviews that stated that they keep shutting the dryer off because of the location of the on and off button, but i havn&#x27;t done that once. hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me at all. i am going to purchase a couple more.</li>
    <li> If you have long, thick hair, this dryer is a must!  The high speed setting throws out a ton of super hot air cutting drying time in half.  The low speed setting is great for styling.  I have never dried my hair in a more efficient way. It is also lightweight and rather quiet.  A very useful tool for the busy woman on the run.  Thanks Revlon!</li>
    <li> Ive had this hairdryer for 6 months now, it dries my hair good and hasnt broke. I dont use the attachments cuz i didnt know what they were for (:</li>
    <li> I really like how light weight this dryer is - it&#x27;s also very powerful. I would recommend this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer - it has plenty of options, it&#x27;s light and easy to travel with &amp; It works!</li>
    <li> My wife bought this hair dryer about 2 years ago and we are now on our 4th one.  Here is a brief description of how we got to the 4th dryer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Duration of use:  7 months - hair dryer started burning/smoking&lt;br /&gt;2.  Duration of use:  10 months - electrical fire&lt;br /&gt;3.  Duration of use:  8 months - it just died&lt;br /&gt;4.  Duration of use:  Current - experimental trial - family has placed bets on how long it will last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They must have their marketing team doing the engineering and R&amp;D on these dryers.</li>
    <li> A little too hot, but powerful.</li>
    <li> After reading rave reviews on this hair dryer I decided to purchase this as a   gift for my sister for Christmas who has an old dryer that was really old.    She loved how lightweight it was and dried her shoulder length straight hair   extremely fast and left her hair very soft.    Said she would recommend it anyone!    Pros - Affordable, lightweight, dries hair fast!</li>
    <li> Lightweight and dries fast!</li>
    <li> This is again another hair care product with rave reviews, that does not live up to its expectations. It&#x27;s not a bad blow dryer, its just not the best. It is better than my 4 year old heavy conair,that was weak in power. This iron is infact light weight and has a good amount of power and the noise is not annoying, but it does not give a salon look if that is one wants, or should i say a smoother sheen to the hair. It kind of makes my thick somewhat wavey hair really poofy, which is okay i guess because i end up straighting it anyway. So if you want an iron that works decently, i would get this one, but hey, get it at walmart, its half the price, which i discovered the other day.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife to use, and I use it sometimes. I have no complain. It was good- quiet, light and powerful enough. Best I used so far.</li>
    <li> I have bought Revlon dryer for a short time ago. I liked it very much. I can compair it with Conair dryer (almost the same style and size) I have had.  Revlon dryer is much more lighter, has more variants of drying. Temperature of drying can be more higher, so I can dry my hair much faster. This dryer is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Although the hair dryer worked well for a few months, it now intermittently will turn off or stop working while trying to use it.</li>
    <li> I read a reviewer stating it blew too hard and too cool for her fine hair.  I have very fine hair and think the blow dryer is great.  Boy, I can really tell a difference between a regular blow dryer and an ionic one!  My last ionic blow dryer from Hot Tools broke suddenly one day (after only a year).  So, I was using my old back-up.  My hair was so dry and brittle using that.  No wonder I always thought my hair was so dry growing up.  Once I received this ionic blow dryer from Revlon at such a GREAT price, I was in heaven again!  My hair is incredibly soft.  I love the tool it comes with to control the airstream.  My hair has never looked so good and it cut my drying and ironing time in half.  I would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone!</li>
    <li> I like this blow dryer.  It blows hotter than my old one did and seems to dry my hair faster than my old one did.  My hair is fairly thin, so it doesn&#x27;t usually take that long to dry anyway.  I like the diffuser, but since my hair is stick straight anyway, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything to my hair except make it a little bit smoother, though it does slow down drying time.  I read that it was one of the quietest blow dryers out there, but it&#x27;s about as loud as my old one was.  My old was probably didn&#x27;t have much power, so that&#x27;s probably why it&#x27;s just as quiet/loud.  Overall, I like it.  It&#x27;s super lightweight and it works well.</li>
    <li> After 13 weeks, the dryer stopped working.  I used it two or three times a week, not every day.  When it was working it was fine, but that was probably only about 30 uses.  This product was an absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is the lightest hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned, about half the weight of my previous model. I heard about this hair dryer on a morning TV news show and it was rated the best even over the $100+ tourmaline dryers, so for $23 I had to try it. It was sold out everywhere I looked...Target, Walmart etc. I finally found it here with a 1-3 week wait and ordered it. It did take about 3 weeks to get but It&#x27;s so worth it. My hair is dry in almost half the time, the high setting is sooo strong. I highly recommend this especially if you have long thick hair like me that takes forever to dry naturally.</li>
    <li> I rave about this product to everyone I know!  It makes my hair come out even better than it does at my salon!  It really does cut my drying time in half and my hair feels so silky and smooth!  I live in a very humid climate and I have naturally curly hair so it has been impossible to get straight sleek hair without spending 20 minutes with a straightner.  After using this (affordable!) dryer most days I don&#x27;t even run a staightener through my hair.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this dryer!  It dries incredibly quickly, is the lightest I have ever owned, and is very reasonably priced.  I was going to buy the T3 Tourmaline for nearly 10 times the price, until I realized the seller would not honor its warantee on products purchased through Amazon. I have forever retired my previous ceramic dryer, which strained my arm so much, I considered installing a bracket on my body to hold it up.  Other small details that make a difference:  loop for hanging; buttons well-placed so on/off and cold setting are not hit by accident; comfortable to hold by nozzle instead of handle if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first reviewed this product in 2006. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but it&#x27;s held up for almost four years. I continue to be pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Worked great for 8 months, then began losing power when turned over to dry at certain angles.  Not worth the cost of returning it postage paid plus return shipping.</li>
    <li> I searched and searched for a good hair dryer.  I did not want to spend a fortune on it, yet after reading reviews, decided I did want the tourmaline ionizer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Found this one, bought it, and love it.  Lightweight, yet it does the job beautifully, and I can&#x27;t imagine how the $100+ dryers could do it better.  Comes with a diffuser and concentrator, both included at the base price.  A rare find, and a gem!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It works well, dries my hair quickly and is not heavy. I took a different hair dryer that was both ionic and ceramic back to the store because it was too heavy and the dryer with attachment was so long I kept hitting my head... This one is the right size and and cheaper to boot.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve upgraded my hair dryer in about 10 years lol my hair is long and fine.  This gets it dry quickly without making it stick up.</li>
    <li> Just what my wife wanted. It saves her half the time that it use to take with her previous hair dryer. My purchase was based on a previous review and he was right.</li>
    <li> My mama loves it, I got it for her for Christmas</li>
    <li> I use it almost every day. My best buy on amazon so far.</li>
    <li> Good dryer for the price and with free two day shipping, makes it even better</li>
    <li> I have had this dryer for 2 months and the concentrator, the attachment that you use to blow your hair straight, has melted and continues to melt after every use.  The dryer leaves my hair limp and lifeless and my ends are dry and split since using this dryer.  I cannot believe that this product was developed so poorly.  I would not buy again and would not suggest it to friends either.  Terrible choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking to replace my 20-plus year old black &amp; decker hair dryer which I hung on to due to its light weight &amp; low noise level, I have sensitive ears &amp; loud noise is like being tortured.  The old hair dryer finally gave out I chose this after reading other reviews this really is a quiet &amp; light hair dryer you will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Good looking item.  Performs well.  Great bargain.</li>
    <li> It does work amazing even with dense hair.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Revlon RV544PKF hairdryer I&#x27;ve purchased. The first one lasted 2 years and this most recent one lasted 40 days. only 10 days over the 30 day warrantee. VERY UNHAPPY. Will not be buying a third one.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic when it came to hairdryers--they all blow air into your hair and it dries, right? Not so! The technology in this hair dryer is tourmaline ionic, meaning it reduces static, frizz, and boosts shine. I had a vidal sassoon before, and a Conair before that, and they were supposedly \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; but my hair was still quite a bit frizzy afterwards.     This Revlon is amazing, though--my hair is so straight, sleek, and shiny, without having to apply a bunch of creams or shining sprays. It saves a lot of time! It comes with two attachments (diffuser, concentrator)--I&#x27;ve only used the concentrator to straighten my hair and it takes around six minutes and works effectively.    Also, a HUGE bonus is its lightweight! The comparable Conair version (nearly same price, ionic) is so so much heavier, while this hairdryer is easy to move, so I can pick it up and use it all over my hair.  The only con about this as others have mentioned is that you have to hold it carefully or else your fingers will accidentally turn the hairdryer off--the buttons move easily and are near where you place your fingers to hold it.    Bottom Line: This is the best hairdryer for the price. When I used other hairdryers, my hair is very noticeably frizzier and less shiny compared to this Revlon. It&#x27;s a reasonable price for the technology, and I definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new dryer and found this one. It is very light and not very loud.  The diffuser is huge which can be bad if you travel a lot like me, or have limited storage space.  The ionic part works well.  My hair is less frizzy and have lot of natural curl so I usually have frizz when I blow dry my hair.  Why I returned it was that it the 2 heat settings were not good for me.  The \\&quot;warm\\&quot; was actually hot and the\\&quot; hot\\&quot; was way too hot for my fine delicate hair.  Back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> seems like a nice dryer but it takes forever to dry hair....30-50% longer than my old dryer. the high setting isn&#x27;t very fast. maybe this is to prevent heat damage.</li>
    <li> Super fabulous hair dryer. I love that it cuts drying time to just 5-8 mins while also cutting the frizz. Love my sleek new hair!!</li>
    <li> Great value. Feels like a professional dryer. Lightweight and easy to store. Super powerful. I will test...</li>
    <li> Almost perfect but does take me longer to dry my hair now</li>
    <li> Been using it for over a year and still does a great job. It is not too noisy, dries my hair super fast and wont leave it damaged. A little on the heavy side, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> this hair dryer is so very load it is obnoxious  that I ditched it after a short while and bought another</li>
    <li> Was hopeful about this since it has many great reviews and only a few poor reviews.  However, after nine months (I only use 2-3x a week), the exact same thing happened as other people have reported.  The cord exploded and it broke.  Luckily, I was holding it in a way that I didn&#x27;t get burned, but it could have happened.</li>
    <li> Bought a $200+ T3 to replace my T3 that began to smell like it was burning.  I was less than impressed with that hair dryer and decided to give a less expensive one a try.  I bought this based on the Amazon reviews, and I am not disappointed.  It dries my hair quickly (I have fairly fine, curly hair but a lot of it), leaves it soft and easy to manage.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would recommend this dryer to others.</li>
    <li> Broke within 6 months. Heating element went out.</li>
    <li> Best one I&#x27;ve had in a while. Drys my hair quickly and well.</li>
    <li> Got a good deal for the hair dryer. It came with 2 attachments, diffuser and other one for straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good so far but very loud.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for 5 months and never had a issue. It works well.</li>
    <li> It Stops for a few seconds while it is working and then it continuous  For this price I didn&#x27;t expect high quality though</li>
    <li> and i mostly used it to tame my short bangs! i only used it to dry my entire head of hair about 7 times at most and the thing just stopped working. first the \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; completey stopped working,  then the low . a couple sparks came out last time i turned it on so shut it off, unplugged it and threw it in the trash .</li>
    <li> Great I love it. You will too.</li>
    <li> I bought this lightweight hairdryer to take with me on a trip to England after reading the good reviews that it had. Once in the UK,  I used it with a wall adapter.  About half way through drying my hair, it became hotter, so I switched it to the lower setting.  Suddenly I smelled hair burning, and in what seemed like an instant, I realized that my hair had been badly burnt, the natural bristled brush had burned on the ends, and there was lots of burned hair in it.  I had to leave the hair dryer in UK as it wasn&#x27;t worth it to try and fit it in my suitcase, but I would not trust this dryer, at least not to use in another country.  I don&#x27;t know if it simply can&#x27;t be used with an adapter or if the dryer itself cannot be trusted.  Has anyone else had a problem like this with it?</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, I purchased this hair dryer to replace some model of an ionizer Conair which just stopped working after a number of years.    I love the ergonomics--so comfortable to hold and lightweight.  I have short hair..and wet it and blow it dry every morning.  It is very easy to style with and the different heats are well modulated...so the warm works well.      Thanks to the other reviewers for helping me find this dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was the best one I have ever seen, it is very quiet when it runs and is very light weight.  The different attachments are very handy as well!  Even the color is great!  It is overall the best hair dryer I have ever used!  Thanks Revlon and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and does the job. Good enough for the cost, design, weight, and results. I previously used the Andis 82075 1875W AC Motor Ionic Tourmaline Hair Dryer, which i liked for its power and results but was more expensive, heavier, and had an oddly located on/off button that i would always switch off in mid-dying. In comparison, the Revlon RV544 is a better deal. I first purchased the Farouk Deep Brilliance Professional Hair Dryer to replace my Andis, but i replaced upon first use. The Farouk Deep Brilliance hair dryer was the weakest and slowest hairdryer i had ever used. I printed the return slip immediately. I&#x27;m satisfied with the Revlon replacement.</li>
    <li> I live in humid FLA- and this hairdryer does the trick. Dries fast and efficiently. The cool shot button works quickly. It&#x27;s also lightweight and quiet.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer started smoking and sparking in under one year of use. I&#x27;m very disappointed since the hair dryer is light weight and cuts my drying time in half!</li>
    <li> I got this dryer this week and used it a few times.  It is not so noisy as others have said. Sounds more like a blender on low. The rocker controls are in exactly the right place for me because you can finish with a shot of cool air without taking the dryer away from your hair. It dries faster than my expensive ionic dryer and my hair looks and feels different, too....softer, shinier and styled the way I like it.  If this dryer lasts a long long time, and keeps doing what it is supposed to do, I would say it is almost perfect. I just wish it was a bit smaller since I found it in a &#x27;travel dryer&#x27; search.</li>
    <li> Was fine until it died after 5 months. On to the next.</li>
    <li> Good quality dryer. I tried to fix the front part for concentrated heat, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It is a good hair dryer. It wasn&#x27;t like what people said that it blow really hot air. Both \\&quot;hot and warm\\&quot; air work great! My hair does have a better quality after using it.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, full hair and this dries my hair very quickly.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time at home and at the gym. It&#x27;s so light, quick to dry, and much quieter than my old dryer. Now this is something I use to do my hair often!</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and the low heat setting drys my hair in about 10 minutes without burning it. Since I&#x27;ve used the product 3-4 xs a week for over a month, I have not noticed any split ends. My hair feels smooth and conditioned after I use it. This is a great blow dryer for the cost.</li>
    <li> First one lasted 8-10 yrs and was great!  Bought this one based on previous good experience. This one is working as well as the old one did.</li>
    <li> Buyers beware. While using this hairdryer it sparked in the plug area near my wrist. Luckily it didn&#x27;t burn my skin. But you can see the soot where it hit my wrist. This product is a fire hazard.</li>
    <li> I had this for 13 months, until it sparked, and almost caught on fire! Would not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my previous Revlon dryer.  It gets hot, but only in the Hot &amp; High setting, but not in the Hot &amp; Low setting, which I would use for styling.  It takes longer to dry my hair and I can&#x27;t get it to look the same as it did with my previous dryer.</li>
    <li> My wife would definitely love this! She has extremely long hair that classifies her as a potential candidate for the modern Rapunzel. Drying her hair takes a long time, which this device can curb efficiently.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for a young lady and she loved it.  Was just what we were looking for and is easy to take along with her.</li>
    <li> This blower worked very well for about a year. Then, the motor starting making odd sounds and the heat cranked WAY up--to the extent that the plastic on the end actually got a  hole in it. I can no longer use this hair dryer and would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is light weight but performs powerful. It has the right amount of settings. I do notice silkier hair after using it for a while. The cool air button should relocate though, I hit it accidentally sometime</li>
    <li> I have owned this hair dryer for just under 18 months.  During that time I have used it, on average, 5-6 times per week and up until about a week ago, I loved it.  It dries quickly without getting too hot, the diffuser (which I use regularly on my naturally curly hair) fits snugly without falling off, it has settings for heat and airflow that can be set independently of each other, and it seems to help keep my curly hair smoother and less frizzy.  It is also much lighter than other hair dryers I have used in the past, helping to reduce arm and hand fatigue, especially during a period of longer use, such as when I&#x27;m straightening my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my favorite hair dryer ever...until it abruptly stopped about 60 seconds into use one morning a week ago.  I reset the plug and the outlet and when that didn&#x27;t work, I asked my husband to take a look at it.  He figured out that if you tweaked the cord in a certain way, the dryer would run again.  The problem seemed to be in the 1.5&amp;#34; long thicker area of cord where it attaches to the dryer.  There is no visible fraying or damage on the exterior of the cord, but now the only way I can get the dryer to run is to hold the cord in a certain position and sometimes to pinch or slightly bend it in that thicker area just below the base of the dryer.  I&#x27;ve been limping along like that, continuing to use it for the last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to the Amazon website today to look up the date I had purchased the dryer and saw multiple reviews reporting problems like what I&#x27;m experiencing.  However, I was dismayed to read that in several cases, once the cord began to experience this fault, the dryer has burned users or even caught on fire!  As much as I loved this hair dryer, I&#x27;m not willing to risk a serious burn or an electrical fire to continue using it.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in the durability and quality of this product and concerned about the safety hazard that it poses!  I expected better from a large and well-knownbrand like Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on how much I liked this product when it worked, I&#x27;d give it five stars, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d take a chance on buying another given the short useful life and the safety hazards it poses, hence my final one star rating.</li>
    <li> Purchased this hair dryer as a gift for my daughter who&#x27;s very particular&lt;br /&gt;She was concerned it was not an expensive brand name but has told me&lt;br /&gt;This is the best hair dryer she has e ere owned.  Sh has had many High End&lt;br /&gt;Units but this is very light weight and drys her thick hair quickly and without frizz or static&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is an amazing  alive and highly recommended</li>
    <li> This is a lot quieter than the one that I used to own. The dryer itself is lightweight and it only takes me 15 minutes to get my hair dry. Now I am never late to work.</li>
    <li> It does its job! It&#x27;s a bit long in size. Other than that, the two different high/low and hot/cold works great!</li>
    <li> The button is placed where it is easy to accidentally turn the blowdryer off when you are using it.</li>
    <li> Got it in August 2014, it started to stop for unknown reasons when my families used it in the beginning of 2015. And last month in April 2015, it SPARKLED on my mom&#x27;s hair and face when she was using it. It just works for about eight months. Never purchase this!!!</li>
    <li> I used this dryer lightly for about 2 months (3-4 times per week, for 5-10 min at a time).  It worked pretty well.  But the first time I used it for over 15 minutes, it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;After a quick internet search, it&#x27;s apparent that this is a relatively common issue with this product.  It&#x27;s some kind of power/fuse issue, as the \\&quot;reset\\&quot; button on the plug keeps popping out.  Now it only works on cool air/low air.  I am positive I did nothing to trigger this (in the way of letting it get too hot, wet, using the wrong plug, etc.)  Bummer!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer. It got my hair dry in half the time as my old dryer. Also is lighter to hold. Got one for my daughter who has shoulder length hair. She said she wouldn&#x27;t part with this dryer.</li>
    <li> Works well, came quick, brand new</li>
    <li> I had read in many places that this was a good ionic hair dryer. It was indeed very light and quieter than other 1875 watt dryers I&#x27;ve used before. I found the high/low heat settings to match exactly what I had expected. The high heat was hot enough to dry my hair quickly but not so hot that I felt like my hair was about to fry. The strength of the fan was good as well. I felt like maybe the high fan could have been a little more, but it might be a psychological thing due to the quieter sounds.</li>
    <li> Suddenly stopped working after two months. I was very careful. No water damage. Cleaned the filter. It just stopped. Has anyone experienced this?</li>
    <li> nice product , was a gift to my mom, she says it&#x27;s great product, light, easy to use and nice look...</li>
    <li> It worked well, not fantastic, for about a year. Then it sparked where the cord meets the dryer and almost set my hair on fire!! Apparently, I&#x27;m not the only one.&lt;br /&gt;Beware.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is not too loud and is very light. It used to take my 20 minutes to dry my long thick hair and this has cut that time in half. In addition, the dryer does not crisp up my hair or make it frizzy. I like both attachments as well; one gives my hair volume and quickly dries the roots and the other helps keep my wavy hair straight by blowdrying in sections. Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> If it were more durable, this would be a wonderful hair dryer. I keep mine in a dryer holder.... So it is never dropped, ripped out of the wall, or yanked on. It is used once a day. While it was still under warranty, I found that while holding it an angle, it would turn off and then back on, as if the wire were breaking. Revlon sent me a replacement. Now, under a year later, this second one is doing the same thing. As I am in fear of it becoming a fire hazard, I will throw it away.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer was OK for the year or so I used it. It wasn&#x27;t as nice as the one I was replacing, but I knew that going in and it was acceptable.     However, it randomly stopped working the other day. I plugged it in to use, and it just didn&#x27;t turn on (after of course resetting the cord and the outlet, and trying multiple outlets). I know this wasn&#x27;t a very expensive or a professional model, but I expect more than a year of use out of a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I have bought ionized dryers before with little success, however this one definitely lives up to its claims. Aside from drying well with less noise than traditional dryers, I have seen a notable difference in how smooth my hair is. I have even used this on dry hair to calm frizz. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair to the middle of my back...that I like to wear straight. My old hair dryer would take a good 20-30 minutes to dry it, and that was with me brushing and pulling and exerting some effort. So imagine my wondrous surprise when this hair dryer did the same job in about 10 minutes--no lie! And it is SO light!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the buttons are not placed very well (although I only accidentally turned it off once), and I have to say that I wish the \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; button was able to lock in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position (like my last dryer did).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the sound against my old dryer (probably five years old, but the same wattage and also ionic), and they were about the same, but the Revlon is much lighter and dries the hair much faster. The air stream did seem a bit higher, but that was fine with me since I need that for my hair. And overall, my hair looked the same as it did with my old dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for a new mom with not much time for hairstyles, this hair dryer is a winner. It only gets knocked down to 4 stars because of the button placement and the cold-shot button.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last long....Quit working less than a year after purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this 1 year and 20 days ago.  This morning, it shocked me and flames shot out the bottom.  Save your money on this thing, buy something of better quality.</li>
    <li> It takes forever to dry my hair :(</li>
    <li> I had the dryer for about a year. This week it literally caught on fire and sparks came out the back. Pieces of metal shot out damaging the bathroom mirror. Luckily no one was hurt.  This product should be taken off the market.  If one of the metal pieces went into her my eyes I would have been severely injured.</li>
    <li> Light weight with excellent power with 2 speeds.  The cord is also a good length.  The defuser is sturdy and fits the head of the dryer well.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product received very prompt shipping and excellent quality ... thank you very much, very recommended</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer. It dries my hair a lot faster than my previous dryers. I like to use the diffuser as well, both attachments are great.</li>
    <li> this is awesome! it comes with a diffuser and is super lightweight so I no longer dread drying my hair.  only thing i noticed was that the circuit breaker needed to be reset two of the four times i&#x27;ve used it (not sure if it&#x27;s the product or my circuit breaker...).  i also blew a fuse once.  in any case, i love this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 3 months. I&#x27;m out $25 now. Thanks. DO NOT buy this if you plan on using it for more than a couple months.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. Uses it everyday, it&#x27;s compact and comes with the two additional pieces which is a plus!</li>
    <li> It does seem to help handle the frizz and such as that, but as far as helping hold her curls, not so much.  We are still working on getting her poker strait hair to hold a curl, but we are getting there.  This hair drier definitely helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this dryer! It is much quieter than my old  one, and love the shine it brings to my hair. I would have given 5 stars but it is just a tad heavy for the arthritis in my hands.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this dryer.  It works perfectly and the price was fantastic.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it I have really thick hair and this cuts my drying time in half my hair is shoulder length and before I used to take 30 mins to blow dry it but now the max is 15 mins</li>
    <li> This dryer is lightweight which is important to me. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t get too hot. A good deal for the price</li>
    <li> This Revlon hair dryer has been blowing peoples heads with its style and attachment. It will leave you saying wow it must be Revlon. You get salon performance in this Revlon hair dryer. Help shape that hair style from a hair don&#x27;t to a hair do. Let Revlon blow your head today and be Revlon beautiful.</li>
    <li> A very helpfull hair dryer for any busy woman on the go. Revlon makes nice hair dryer products! If you have long, thick hair, this dryer will probably work well for you too.! The high  setting throws out a lot of heat so air cutting drying time in half what it was with my old dryer. The low speed setting is great for styling and taking your time or if you are worried about creating frizzies. I have never dried my hair in a faster way. It is also not too loud and not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Dries fast and evenly. I would have given it 5 stars, but the on switch it right where you hold the dryer so I often hit the switch and turn it off. Not a big deal and I&#x27;ll get used to it, but it&#x27;s been a bit annoying</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s lightweight and has a warm setting so I don&#x27;t burn my hair.  I would recommend it to anyone who uses a blowdryer daily!</li>
    <li> This dryer is a really good value.  I was willing to spend more, but hesitant to shell out the money for a T3.  Unfortunately, there just isn&#x27;t much in-between.  After checking the reviews, it seemed many of the negative reviewers seemed to expect this to be AS GOOD AS the T3.  I&#x27;m sure I would like a T3 if I had one, but I think my hair looks pretty great with this one.  I have a lot of very fine hair which takes a while to get completely dry.  This dryer is probably the quickest I&#x27;ve used and gets it pretty smooth.  Those are my main requirements of a dryer.  The loudness and weight of the dryer aren&#x27;t terribly important to me, so I can&#x27;t say whether I would recommend it to anyone looking to fill those criteria.  It doesn&#x27;t seem overly loud, and I can get through drying my hair without my arm aching, so that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Great item for a great price</li>
    <li> bought for my wife, it dries her hair.</li>
    <li> Got here fast and was exactly what I was looking for. It works beautifully and the diffuser attached easily.</li>
    <li> Ok, first...I had my previous blowdryer for 8 years!  I loved it. I have tried others and end up returning them or giving them away. This one will be with me until it dies! Its very lightweight (as promised)...which I need because I have fibromyalgia. Even with the defuser, its not heavy at all! Also, my old blowdryer, I had to super glue the defuser onto it because it kept falling off. This doesnt! It snaps right on and stays there. I like that it has a switch for hot and warm because I hated having to hold it down to get a cooler setting. And now the biggie...I have very long hair and those of you who do will appreciate this...it doesnt get caught in the air intake! With other blow dryers that have this much power, it happens a lot. There you are...ripping your hair out of the back of the blowdryer. Not with this! It blows hard, but doesnt catch your hair!  Love this!! Thanks Revlon!</li>
    <li> I like the dryer a lot.  It dries my hair quickly, I have naturally curly hair that&#x27;s to my shoulder blades and it dries in ten minutes or less.  It has a nice glossy finish when it dries too.  Another positive is that the dryer is nice and light, my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired when I&#x27;m drying my hair.  I wish the cord was retractable, that would have made it five stars.  Obviously I knew it wasn&#x27;t when I bought it, but it would improve my review if it were.  Wishful thinking :). My one complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to get very warm.  It&#x27;s warm but not hot.  My other blow dryers in the past have gotten very warm, so I&#x27;m wondering if something is wrong with it.  Overall it gets the job done quickly and nicely.  Four stars.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer.  Especially the root lifter attachment - its like a mini massage for my head every day.  The only complaint I have is that my hair is still somewhat frizzy when I use it. Otherwise, its light and drys my hair the fastest out of any dryer I have used (I have long, thick hair).</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be light and quiet, but it&#x27;s just somewhat lighter and not loud. I had higher expectations, but I suppose it is on the lower end price-wise, so you get what you pay for. I like that it has two attachments that come with, but I don&#x27;t know how much they will work. I was planning on using this for traveling, but it&#x27;s longer than I expected.</li>
    <li> This dryer does my my hair faster which is a plus and is moderately quiet. Don&#x27;t see any difference in bounce and shine in my hair, but am thankful for the faster drying time.</li>
    <li> This dryer is not for people with thick long hair. It does not give enough heat. I am attaching a picture for you to see how my hair looked after using this blower. Unfortunately I will have to continue to spend $100+ for a blower.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted. It is light weight and the knobs are very easy to use. I frequently turn my drier off and on while styling and these controls are a breeze for that -- unlike my last one which took two hands! It dries my hair great and I always use it with the smaller attachment, threw the other one away because I never use it.</li>
    <li> I received the new blow dryer this weekend and it was DEFINITELY worth its price.  I was kind of leery at first because of how cheap the price was, but the dryer turned out to be exactly what i wanted.  I recently used a chi professional at a friends house and thought it was amazing, but didn&#x27;t want to spend the 85$ for it, so I researched and found this Revlon and figured well its only $20 so if it doesn&#x27;t do a good job, I&#x27;m not losing a lot....but sure enough, my hair is so smooth and straight...with my old dryer, it would always be super frizzy and I would have to straighten it right after blow drying it. I dont have to do that anymore !!!</li>
    <li> About four months after purchasing this hair dryer, which left my hair looking dry and brittle, it started turning on and off intermittently while in use. I had to twist the cord with one hand to make the wires connect while trying to use the hairdryer with the other. One day I got a nasty electrical shock when I turned it on, and it started sparking.    I took it apart at some point before I threw it out to see if I could fix it, and it turns out that their \\&quot;Ionic/tourmaline technology\\&quot; translates to the hot air being blown through a cardboard toilet paper tube that has been spray-painted gold. Apparently gold paint &#x3D; tourmaline? I think not.    Do NOT buy this product. It is falsely advertised and a fire hazard.</li>
    <li> So far i really like this dryer. i especially love that it came with 2 add ons - a diffuser AND a straightening tool. how cool is that. 4 settings, High heat setting works well. no complaints. i got it within 2 days of ordering it. i recommend this product</li>
    <li> the only thing i wish is that this blow dryer came with a comb and that the on off button was made//placed in such a way that it wasnt so easily  turned off/on while in use. Quite annoying</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light weight and gets the job done. Sometimes my fingers slip onto the buttons, but other than that, no issue. It&#x27;s inexpensive compaired to others and works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very small but it&#x27;s light. Easy to operate. Dry my thick shoulder length hair in about 3 to 4 minutes. This is my first blow dryer so I am not sure whether this is fast or not. And it seems not producing unwanted volume since my hair is already a lot I don&#x27;t want any more volume. Personally I am pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> Good for it&#x27;s price range</li>
    <li> Powerful and light weight. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem as \\&quot;soft\\&quot; as it did with the Sharper Image hair dryer, but good hair dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> This only lasted a couple of months before it died an unexpected and unheroic death.  Nothing worse that starting your day with wet hair when your hair dryer dies. Save your money and get a nicer brand that will last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a far more expensive tourmaline hairdryer and wanted another nice hairdryer. This works great- eliminates frizz and dries hair quickly and smoothly.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself and my daughter, both of ours went out at the same time.  We wanted one with a diffuser and since this one did so I bought them.  I&#x27;m pleased to say that months later they still work great.  The force of air on high is excellent for her thick curly hair and it works great on my fine hair.  We&#x27;re pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> this is a great blow dryer. i would have given it 5 stars if there were a med. speed setting.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance.  I haven&#x27;t bothered using the attachments. Some reviewers have complained about the location of the on/off switch.  After the first use, that is no longer an issue since one quickly learns how to hold the unit.</li>
    <li> Bought this 3 years ago for $11 and it&#x27;s still alive and kicking. I have long, straight, medium thickness hair and it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to dry with this hairdryer. I can&#x27;t speak to how the attachments work because I&#x27;ve never used them. I like this one because it&#x27;s powerful but it doesn&#x27;t blow me away like some others I&#x27;ve had that would end up just tangling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a new hairdryer in a while now since its not something that needed to be changed unless it is broken, and I&#x27;m really glad my old one broke so i got the chance to try this great hair dryer out. I found it to be lightweight and makes my hair feel silky and smooth (not frizzy and dry like the old traditional ones may make my hair feel) although it is moderately noisy. It is also pretty powerful as it dries my hair in half the time as my old dryer.I definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This dryer, gets very hot, drys quickly, no fuzzing or flyaway hair.  I have thick, wavy but fine hair.  LOVE IT !</li>
    <li> Purchased this product 14 months ago, and it broke this morning.  Agree with the above reviews about its quality as a dryer, it had worked well, but now I&#x27;m hair dryer-less.  Called up Helen of Troy, since it is still under a 2-year product warranty.  However, to get a new dryer I&#x27;d need to ship in the old one, write a $5 check, and wait another 7-10 days processing time before they ship out.  Plus, if they don&#x27;t have the RV544 dryer in stock (which they can&#x27;t tell you on the phone), they&#x27;ll send you a different model, who knows which kind.  (mailing address: 1 Helen of Troy Plaza; El Paso, TX 79912)  Sp one way shipping fare, plus $5, plus 2+ weeks processing time does not equal a stellar reason to use the warranty, so I&#x27;m just purchasing a new one with my Amazon Prime account.  Overall unfortunate customer service experience from Helen of Troy.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair dryer. Halves my drying time and keeps my hair from burning, happened once, don&#x27;t want it again.</li>
    <li> There is not much to this hair dryer but, it&#x27;s not very loud, easy to use, dries quickly and stores in a drawer easily.</li>
    <li> Light weight works great</li>
    <li> I gave 5 stars because of price.  I have short hair, so it served my purpose well, therefore I cannot comment on it&#x27;s use for long hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace one that died. The last one (exact same model) lasted 5 and a half years, so pretty confident that this one will too. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times my wife dropped the last one. She has thick long hair, the kind my barber would charge double to cut, so it runs forever to get her hair dry. It certainly took a licking and kept on ticking. In 5 more years I hope that this one will still be going strong, but if not, I think 5 years is a pretty good run  *UPDATE 1 year later and it makes a weird noise. Like a rattle, but not the good kind, the death kind. Now it is a 4 star because it did work well, and I am not sure if the death rattle was a quality thing or if my wife dropped it down the stairs and it stopped working &amp;#34;all of a sudden&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but so far so good. It&#x27;s very lightweight and dries my hair faster then my old Conair, which is kind of surprising since it doesn&#x27;t get super hot, even on high. It isn&#x27;t loud either which is nice. I&#x27;ve only used the straightening attachment thus far but it works well and fits snugly. I have very curly, frizzy hair and it&#x27;s much silkier now. For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Great! Excellent! It works great! Tiny but perfect for me! Easy to use... totally recommend it!! Buy it now! Don&#x27;t wait!</li>
    <li> I love the attachments.  The diffuser is a little bulky but still does it&#x27;s job.  Great all around dryer.  I wish the HOT setting was a little bit more HOT but still efficient for my needs.  But all in all-great buy.  The price made me nervous at first but I&#x27;m finding it very useful and quality is great :)</li>
    <li> Hair dryer works great. I&#x27;m glad I ordered it. With a round brush and the hairdryer I can make my long, thick, coarse hair look unbelievably smooth.</li>
    <li> Great dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> easy to use! works well no problems good choice good price very safe wife likes it.&lt;br /&gt;nice coloring nice set up with parts</li>
    <li> Unfortuately it blows out cold air instead of hot air. The hot air is on for a second and then goes back to cold.I was hoping it would adjust but it&#x27;s not. Now I am returning it one day after the expiration for returns and only to get back half of what I paid plus additional shipping. THEY SHOULD REFUND ME 100% FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS DEFFECTIVE.</li>
    <li> Get&#x27;s hot enough to get the job done without damaging hair!  Simple and effective!  OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I had to call the company and they are excellent in providing high-level customer service.</li>
    <li> I have fine, color treated hair but I have 3 daughters with a variety of hair types. My daughters all have their own but everyone ends up in my bathroom to share this hair dryer. It works better than any other hair dryer for adding shine, reducing frizziness. It is light to hold and I will definitely buy another if/when I need a new one.Best hair dryer I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this hairdryer. It&#x27;s lightweight and it takes at least 5 minutes less to dry my long hair than my old hairdryer.  My hair is smooth and less frizzy.  I would strongly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> Writing this review for my wife.  She loves the hair dryer-- says it is MUCH better than her old one.  She uses the diffuser attachment a lot and it works really well.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the money.  It is hard to find all three:  tourmaline, ionic, and ceramic in an iron that is affordable.  You will get the best results using the flat nozzle attachment and drying with a round or paddle brush - depending on the length of your hair.  The dryers &#x27;hot&#x27; setting truly is hot - as it should be.  I recommend that you use a heat protectant before drying to keep your hair in the best possible condition.  I&#x27;ve been a hairdresser since 1993.</li>
    <li> Broke a week after arrival</li>
    <li> Bought this blow dryer for my mom who has waist-length long, thick curly hair. She loves the diffuser for her curls. She said it makes drying her hair easier with less frizz. Great hair dryer that has different setting so hair is not overly dried out.</li>
    <li> Comes with two different cones that I don&#x27;t know how to use and dries my hair perfectly which makes me sleepy lol.  Blows hot and is lightweight.</li>
    <li> The hair dyer is wonderful! It has 2 attachments that I use daily, dry and styles hair easily. You cant bet the price!</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist and during the middle of a very busy Saturday my over 2 yr old T3 went quiet and was not putting out any heat.  Knowing I had to have another hair dryer by the middle of the week I went into action finding a replacement.  I stumbled upon this hair dryer and many reviews claiming it&#x27;s qualities and how much it is a less expensive T3 with all the same qualities as the T3- WRONG!  It does not dry the hair as well, causes a lot more friziness, takes a very long time to dry hair, the cord is MUCH TOO MUCH too short, weighs more, is louder, and just does not leave the hair looking as shiny.  I am really disappointed with it and all the reviews (on many websites) that made it sound like something it is not.  In the dryer&#x27;s defense; I know it is NOT a professional dryer and it was simply a quick fix until I could get another T3 and if I were to just use it at home I would probably be quite happy with it not expecting \\&quot;professional\\&quot; results. There is a CLEAR difference in the results from one to the other.  Again, I know it is not a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; hair dryer so I would say the average person leaving behind a regular (non ionic or tourmaline) hair dryer will definitely see the difference once they start using this dryer but for me, a professional who puts a lot of effort into blow dries, it was \\&quot;ok\\&quot; until I got my T3 back!</li>
    <li> I think this may be one of those items that is brought in from China as not an authentic item.  On it&#x27;s first use, I went to use the cold shot button and it stuck to that.  I changed all the settings hoping it would get reset, but for the day, it did not.  I turned it on the next day and it was working again.  Pretty poor for a brand new hair dryer.  Also, it gets extremely hot to where it can easily burn your head, even on its lowest setting.  Total piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair. This dries it very well, very fast and completely. I don&#x27;t have any wet tips like I did with my last dryer. Mostly because my arm was tired from holding it so long. This one works!!</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer a lot, though I don&#x27;t use it often because I have very curly hair and would have to feel like taking the time to use product and/or straighten my hair. My husband uses it sometimes when he&#x27;s strapped for time in the morning (especially in the winter), and he really likes it as well.</li>
    <li> My expensive Chi brand blow drier went out after only two years. After researching several blow driers I saw this one had great reviews so I decided to try it out since I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on another blow drier. This drier is great. It dries quickly and blows really hot air. I&#x27;m very pleased with it and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great price and the girlfriend couldn&#x27;t be happier. This has definitely performed and lasted well beyond her expectations with almost daily use and the diffuser is great to prevent her hair from frizzing</li>
    <li> My girls and I are enjoying this, we all have curly hair and the diffuser works great.</li>
    <li> Does its job quite well given the cheap price. if youre on a budget and need a great dryer, i&#x27;d get this.</li>
    <li> Works great - good value - wife has started using it rather than the heavy professional one she&#x27;s used for years</li>
    <li> Purchased this about a year ago based on the &amp;#34;#1 seller&amp;#34; designation and good price.  I was disappointed in the performance pretty much immediately, as it seemed to lack the power of the dryer it was replacing.  This doesn&#x27;t matter as much for me, as I have a shorter hairstyle, but it did matter for my wife. Also, despite the dryer categorized as being Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic, which is supposed to use a type of heat that doesn&#x27;t over dry your hair or create frizz/static, I felt like this product produced a dry type of heat that did just that.  Therefore a few days ago I looked around Amazon and ordered a different brand that will hopefully perform better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bigger issue - The very next morning after ordering the new blowdryer, my wife was using this Revlon and was freaked out when it suddenly started sparking and smoking in her hand.  And when I say sparking, I mean she said there were sparks showering out of the unit.  Luckily she got the dryer unplugged, but not before it burned through half the cord.  I was in there immediately after this incident and could smell the burned rubber.  I set out to write a review and now see that many of the other negative reviews had the same scary situation with the dryer nearly exploding or catching fire during use.  You would think that based on the frequency there would be a recall on this model.  This dryer was an underachiever before it blew up, but now, with the safety hazard factor, I would urge anyone looking at this model to steer clear.  There are plenty of other $20.00 hair dryers that do not carry a risk of injury or fire, so why take a risk?</li>
    <li> This was the first ionic dryer I have tried &amp; I love it!  It is nice &amp; lightweight like it says, but more importantly, it dries my hair quickly and the diffuser helps save my curls.  It has just enough settings - hot or warm and high or low speed.  I found it is easier to use without the directional flow attachment but love the diffuser.  My husband says both air flow speeds are too fast for him, but our old dryer was VERY old and he was use to the weak air flow.</li>
    <li> My old blow dryer finally bit the dust so off I go to find a new one.  After looking at a bunch, I picked this one and have not been disappointed.  I have very thick, curly hair that I just got cut short and this dryer makes it so easy to smooth out if I want to. It&#x27;s supposed to have a lint filter though and I have not been able to locate it.</li>
    <li> It is really light weighted, and it dries the hair fast, but the cold shot button does not make the air cold, it just makes it less hot!</li>
    <li> A brand name in Hair Dryer....great uniform heating, useful accessories, at such a low price...dries wet hair in max 2-3 mins....what else do you need !!!</li>
    <li> Works well. Priced competitively.</li>
    <li> Good dryer, I like the nozzle and heat settings. Not professional quality, but very good for the price. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> s***ty, because its not strong enough maybe i EXPECTED TO MUCH !! FROM THIS STUPID BLOW DRYER.  It took way too long to dry , maybe my hair to thick for any hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great value.  Feels like a professional dryer.  Lightweight and easy to store. Super powerful.</li>
    <li> Light weight and powerful.  Works great!</li>
    <li> After having this dryer for 9 months it died. Checked all of the things the mfg told me to ,cleaning lint filter etc. I was told to return it under warrantee. First I have to pay shiping to them (USPS $7.85) and pay for return shipping ($5.00). And they told me it takes about  90 days to fulfill a warranty replacement. What a hassle. This thing only cost $22.49. Not worth the bother. I should point out that the previous hair dryer I purchased was from Remington and it lasted 15 years. So I purchased another remington. Good luck if you decide to purchase this dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a solid hairdryer.  It dries quickly, it&#x27;s comfortable to hold, and it has the right amount of bells and whistles.  I like how it not only has a hot setting and the usual cold-blast, but it also has a warm setting, which is nice to be able to use on my young daughter.  It does what it needs to do for not a lot of money!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this item from amazon.com and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  It&#x27;s light, generates good airflow, and dries my hair quickly.  Before I made the purchase, I researched it on this site and at consumersearch.com, where it was a top rated product.  So far it has not disappointed.  April 2, 2017 update.  I had this product for 8.75 years before it finally gave out.  Used it almost every day for maybe 3-5 minutes a day.  Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, so recently bought another one.  I noticed some people have had sparking problems, so I&#x27;m a bit leary about the new unit.  Perhaps quality control on these units has gone down since my original purchase in 2008?  Anyway, I will update again if I have any problems.  One more thing.  This unit does not have a super strong fan, so if you have longer or very thick hair you might want to go with another dryer.  But it is nice and light!</li>
    <li> It is not handy for drying your own hair. It is not durable.  But it does the work as intended.</li>
    <li> After many years of daily service, my old Revlon 1875, Model #473 finally stopped running.  Without hesitating I went out to buy what I thought would be a \\&quot;new-and-improved\\&quot; version of the same dryer.  What I found was a product with no resemblance, except for the name.    The ONLY good thing I can say about his new dryer, Model RV544, is that it dries my hair much faster than the old one did.  But the result is disastrous.  I have short, straight hair that is well-styled.  This dryer leaves my hair limp, with no body.  I used the \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; setting on the old dryer to give my hair lift; on the new model it&#x27;s a useless feature.  The attachments are also useless, at least for me.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but after using this dryer every day for a week, trying various combinations of heat/speed settings, I&#x27;m going to pack it up and return it.    Another note -- I tried to find a website so I could write to the manufacturer.  It&#x27;s odd that there is no such website.  The name \\&quot;Revlon\\&quot; means nothing on this piece of equipment, because it&#x27;s made in China by \\&quot;Helen of Troy\\&quot; so no one is even taking responsibility for this worthless item.  Just goes to show ya -- sometimes newer does NOT equal better.</li>
    <li> At first I loved it... until it stated acting up. I would hear this change in the power and then the air coming out wouldn&#x27;t be hot anymore. I had to wait for a bit then the noise would come again, and it would start warming up the air again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now is not even blowing hot air anymore....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed on this product which looked great at first.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer! My wife said it would be better if it got a little hotter and blew just a bit more harder. She doesn&#x27;t get the crazy witch hair like she use to with her old one! Lol! Other than that it&#x27;s light, a good price, and my wife is happy! So its a win win!(She has long and dark thick hair)</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is light, powerful, and hot. Best one I&#x27;ve ever used and it gives me salon results. I ordered this at 2p on a Wednesday and it was at my door by the time I got home from work on Thurday. Excellent product and service. P.S. Dirt cheap.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time, works great, thank you.</li>
    <li> The end of the hair dryer with the black flow nose gets extremely hot.  I feel like I cannot set it down on counter as it might burn.  The handle for me was bad because I kept hitting the control buttons with thumb and fingers while I was trying to dry my hair.  Trying to hold it so I don&#x27;t push the buttons cramps my hand.  It does dry hair fairly fast.</li>
    <li> Light and efficient. I have long and thick hair and it takes me 6 min to blow 80% dry. I&#x27;m satisfied with the result.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for the past 13 yrs and it still works great. Only problem is when I plug it into the outlet the plug makes a buzzing noise ,which means it&#x27;s time for a new dryer. . It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does so efficiently.</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d upgraded my dryer years ago!</li>
    <li> I love the Light weight, works great. Tangle free cord is great as well.</li>
    <li> I read good reviews on this product before I bought it 2 years ago for one of my teenagers. The dryer is light to hold , the back cover doesn&#x27;t fall off all the time ( like mine does) and it has a lot of power without putting out excessive damaging heat . After a few months of use , I decided to buy a second dryer for my other daughter who has long, thick hair and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of patience for spending too much time drying it....problem solved. She gets the job done in about 6 minutes and I don&#x27;t have to nag her about  wet hair anymore.So far both dryers work well</li>
    <li> Worked well, but broke after a few months. A dud.</li>
    <li> After sending back two hair dryers before this one, I am very happy with my purchase. This is one of the best hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s super lightweight, so it doesn&#x27;t make your arms tired before you&#x27;re done drying your hair. It also makes your hair very soft. Definitely recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these hairdryers for a rental home.  I did not open them or try them until a guest just tried to use one.  One of them works and one of them doesn&#x27;t.  Lesson learned.  Try out your products before the return period expires.</li>
    <li> Lightweight which was great but it broke after just a few months.  Wish I had not wasted my money on this, as I now have to just buy another one.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing Revlon again.</li>
    <li> This is my very first hair dryer &amp; I really like it. Though I have used it only for few times I can say it works really fast. No regrets yet. Too good for the price.</li>
    <li> I found this hair dryer was good.Buttons got in the way a bit when holding it as i kept turning it on and off to start with.Apart from that it was as good as i was expecting it to be.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting, as opposed to just a shot of cool air.</li>
    <li> Its definitely a great deal for personal use! I have short hair and it dries in 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hairdryer. It comes with a diffuser option, perfect for curly hair. It has a warm and hot setting and can be used on low or high. It certainly does the job.</li>
    <li> It does the job for the price, so far works great</li>
    <li> Very nice one and pleasant purchase experience . We use for daughter&#x27;s hair dry and the professional blower protect her hair from damage</li>
    <li> I have fine hair with a digital perm.  The attachment is perfect for keeping my curls bouncy and it never burns my hair.  Lots of airflow so your hair dries fast.</li>
    <li> My wife Christine has had one of two problems: drys too much and scorches her hair or doesn&#x27;t dry enough and takes an hour to dry. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so glad I found this Revlon dryer. Simply put, this is the best dryer on the market hands down. She has been a happy camper and gets her hair poofy and styled in 10 minutes. Done deal!</li>
    <li> This is my second one. The first was so solid that my gf took it for herself!!   My Tourmaline Ionic never let me down while other dryers burned out.</li>
    <li> This item is good but not as great as all the reviews make it out to be.  It does dry my girlfriends hair quicker than her old dryer and leaves it softer but its not any lighter or quieter which were the main reasons i purchased.  All and all good enough but you can run down to the local Target and pick up something similar I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> I had read reviews prior to buying this hair dryer about how it didn&#x27;t last long, sparks shot out, etc. Figured what are the chances it could happen to me? 5 months and the hair dryer worked well...UNTIL, just yesterday, it decided to make a huge popping sound and shot sparks out all over the place. Luckily, no one was around and it didn&#x27;t start a fire or anything. I will not be repurchasing this item and I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy it. Yes it&#x27;s cheap, but you&#x27;re getting a really short time use out of it (not to mention it&#x27;s a fire hazard.) I&#x27;ll play it safe next time and shell out the extra cash if I need to for a good one.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is very loud.  It also only lasted one year. I bought it on December 7 2013 and it died mid-dry on December 21 2014.  My last hair dryer (of what I thought was comparable quality) lasted five times as long before biting the dust</li>
    <li> Love it. I use the diffuser to dry off my dog and she likes it better than blowing the air full on.</li>
    <li> Great dryer. I don&#x27;t need to flat iron much after a dry with this. I have very coarse hair that needs a lot of straitening. The cool shot doesn&#x27;t get cold but just not hot. The button doesn&#x27;t depress completely either.</li>
    <li> Nothing different from the old hair dryer I had before.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old dryer with this model.  Works great.  Leaves hair shiny.  Lightweight and easy to hold.  Hair dries quickly.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s really lightweight but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made any difference in drying time or shine for my hair.</li>
    <li> I got this item because I&#x27;m going away for college and I needed a new dryer but didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for it. I am mixed race and have wavy to slightly curly hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz. This dryer is easy to use and came with attachments that are useful and work well (even heat distribution and I&#x27;ve noticed less frizz). They can be a little difficult to remove at first. Cord is a good length and the dryer is light weight. My arms weren&#x27;t tired (usually takes about 30 minutes to completely dry my hair). The hatch at the back is hinged for easy cleaning and it has straight forward settings. Only problem that I have with the switches is that depending on you grip you can accidentally switch settings or turn the dryer off. Cool button is in a good spot and can be easily held down. To stay on cool setting longer I recommend putting heat setting on warm instead of hot. Over all a great deal at around $20.</li>
    <li> Everything you need. Nothing you don&#x27;t.  Tip keeps from burning the little ones.  Good in the hand and durable.  Have no fear.</li>
    <li> I love the way this dryer works, lots of heat and the diffuser keeps my curls in place...the only reason this did not get a 5 is because it is a bit heavy.  Granted I am older and my wrists and hands aren’t as strong as they one were but it dries so fast I don’t have to hold it for long.</li>
    <li> I have thick, long, curly hair and have always air-dried. When I&#x27;m really in a hurry, I use my husbands blow dryer, but always find it leaves my hair looking frizzy and destroyed. I decided to purchase a hair diffuser, but couldn&#x27;t find one to match the blow dryer we already have- so for not much more than the diffuser alone, I decided to try this blow dryer, which came with a diffuser &amp; concentration attachment.    This blow dryer is amazing!    It leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth, which is the opposite of what I&#x27;ve always thought a blow dryer would do. Best of all, it dries super fast. In 5-10 minutes I am ready to walk out the door and I still have my curls!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer a few weeks agao at BJ&#x27;s wholesale club for only $17.99. It came with a free anti-frizz ionic brush as well. After trying hair dryers by Chi, Conair, and Wahl, I was so fed up. All those dryers took a very long time to dry my shoulder-length naturally-wavy hair (over 15 minutes), and they left me with frizz and no shine. The Revlon is fantastic. It only took 8 minutes to completely dry my hair, and left me with smooth beautiful shine. Note: I normally use SunSilk hydrating shampoo and conditioner, and Lanza Strait Line Smoother Straightening Balm.  The model number on the box says it is the RV-5242 (I think because they are including the free brush). The brush itself it the BEST snag-free static-free brush I have used in years. I HIGHLY recommend this dryer to everyone.</li>
    <li> This product is neither Ionic, nor Ceramic! What a disappointment! It doesn&#x27;t appear to even be a real Revlon dryer... the small print on the box is not available via Amazon product photos, so I bought it only because I was mislead to believe that it was a new Ionic Ceramic technology, which it is most definitely is not. The cold shot button does not do it&#x27;s job, and my hair is not left with the ionized freshness that a true ionic dryer gives. And if you look down the barrel of this dryer, it becomes very obvious that it also is NOT ceramic. My hair does not agree with it&#x27;s use. However, it would cost me at least a third of the price I paid to return it, so I&#x27;m not going to (my better half uses it to warm the toilet seat... that&#x27;s about all it&#x27;s good for).</li>
    <li> This is a great little hairdryer. I like the fact that it is so light weight. It works great also. I would definitely buy another one of the same model.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer works great!  My hair is dry in about 5 minutes and the concentrator works well at smoothing it all out.  My hair feels full and soft, not dried out.  The shipping speed was slow---it took the full \\&quot;14 days\\&quot; to arrive.  Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and have recommended it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of the price but it is far better than the other more expensive models I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features I was looking for:&lt;br /&gt;1. Lightweight so my wrists do not hurt after using it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Long cord so it can reach under my vanity and still have plenty of space to reach above my head.&lt;br /&gt;3. Hot heat but not scalding.&lt;br /&gt;4. Enough oomph so that when I use a round brush, it actually wraps around my hair to create volume and waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This met all my needs, no complaints. The attachments are great too. I have fine limp hair (but a lot of it) that is not really curly and not really straight so I either have to use the nozzle and straighten it with a round brush to give me volume and shape, or use  a ton of product with the diffuser to make it somewhat curly/wavy-ish.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is powerful and lightweight and does a good job drying my usually frizzy hair and making it relatively smooth.  The only drawbacks are the noise (I bought it thinking it would be quieter than my old dryer-- not so, but about average for hair dryers), and the placement of the buttons (I keep hitting them by accident, but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t get used to).  Overall, I would recommend this dryer, especially if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a T3.  I like the diffuser attachments that come with it as well. Also, keep in mind that the airflow is POWERFUL, so if you don&#x27;t like getting blasted by a stream of air on the high setting, then this isn&#x27;t for you.  It would benefit from a medium setting.</li>
    <li> I read all the rave reviews and since I needed a new dryer and was cheap, it I went for it.  It&#x27;s fine but I don&#x27;t understand all the raves. It&#x27;s not noticeably quieter than my dying Conair, and only 3 ounces different in weight. It didn&#x27;t shorten the drying time at all, (I&#x27;ve been timing) I think it actually increased the frizzies a bit. The high setting is way to hot and the warm setting is not quite hot enough. The plastic casing is too smooth and slips in my hand. The ridges they put on the handle for traction are uncomfortable on my palm and the cool shot button hurts my finger. The rocker switch on the Conair is a better design.What really made me review was the ridiculous claim on the box that it was a $120 value! If they&#x27;re selling it for $16 then it&#x27;s a $16 value. Believe me, had I spent $120 on this dryer with those claims, it would be in the box and on the way back!  I&#x27;ll keep this for my overnight bag and continue my search.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday at the spa where I swim. It is light and powerful. I have not had problems with fizzy hair as others have reported, but I use Aveda Be Curly before blow drying. The diffuser attaches very firmly and would never fall off, as others do. The buttons can be unexpectedly turned off when using, but you just have to get use to where to put your hand when holding it. It is not particularly quiet, but I was most interested in fast and effective. I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this, and it was highly recommended by outside reviewers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer as a gift for my daughter who has very long, thick hair. She wanted a powerful dryer that would cut down on time spent fixing her hair. She liked it very much.</li>
    <li> I bought this blowdryer in December of 2010.  I used it about 2-3 times per week during that time period.  I was using it last night and it shorted out.  The fan just stopped running halfway through drying my hair.  Fortunately I had an old blowdryer lying around so I was able to finish the job.  However, in my opinion, a blowdryer that only last 10 months is not worth the purchase!!</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer. It&#x27;s a great deal.  I like how light weight it is and how quickly it dries.</li>
    <li> Perfect machine, great price</li>
    <li> Good blowdryer, good power</li>
    <li> great blow dryer for a inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase. Good quality and I love that it has two diff temp options; Warm and Hot.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer based on the great reviews it got and it lived up to it&#x27;s expectations. My hair dries quickly with this dryer and it feels soft and shiny after use, not dry or damaged. The dryer is a standard sized dryer. It&#x27;s also pretty powerful. The only issues: 1. Because of placement of the switches in front of the dryer, sometimes I accidentally hit them during use and turn the dryer off. 2. The dryer take a few minutes to get hot. Overall, great dryer and my hair is lovin it!</li>
    <li> Loved the way this dryer worked but it died right at one year.  Used for about 5 minutes daily on very short hair. A loud whine started coming from blow-dryer followed by smoke. Very disappointed.  Update 12/2014 on replacement dryer.  This is the 2nd one of these hair dryers that I have gotten that has lasted only about year.  This time when it died fire &amp; sparks came out around the cord in the handle. Very scary!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair (pencil-sized curls) that I tend to straighten very often during the colder months. I decided to try this &#x27;ionic&#x27; dryer because it is supposedly healthier for hair compared to a regular blow dryer. It comes with a concentrator attachment as well as a diffuser attachment, which I only used once and it works fine from what I remember but I do not wear my hair curly. I use it with the [[ASIN:B0002YE8V6 Vidal Sassoon VS7963 Ionic Thermal All Purpose Brush]] that I purchased together with it and they make a very good team for blowing my hair out as long as I comb my curls out beforehand, because the pins on the brush otherwise cause tangles. The brush purposely heats up, allowing the underside of the hair being blown to receive an equal amount of heat also, so I guess it is useful. Compared to every other blow dryer I have ever used in life, I definitely believe this is the best one I&#x27;ve used and I am satisfied enough that I would rather repurchase this one than try another brand. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the quality of the dryer itself or the &#x27;ionic&#x27; technology (I haven&#x27;t tried any other &#x27;ionic&#x27; dryer before) but I notice that, as promised, my hair is healthier feeling than it usually would feel after blow drying it. Whereas most blow dryers leave a certain level of brittleness to my hair, this blow dryer actually leaves my hair in a condition comparable to that of my hair when I allow it to air dry naturally. My most important comment to make about this dryer is that it is very hot, I will consider that a good thing. The settings are Warm and Hot but I am never able to use the Hot because the Warm is already as hot as I can take it. I am able to use the Hot setting on my ends but I cannot put that heat anywhere near my scalp. I do not consider the temperature as a bad thing though because when I use the Cool Shot on the Warm setting it becomes room temperature, and it is easy to hold the Cool Shot button for the entire drying time if desired. It isvery light weight and relatively quiet especially when compared to an average blow dryer. I would equate its weight to that of a full bottle of conditioner; very light. I have had this dryer for nearly 2 years now and it still works like it did when it was brand new. I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth for the low price that it cost, and I expect to get at least another couple of years worth of use out of it.</li>
    <li> Dependable blow dryer.  Fast drying and cost effective!</li>
    <li> Second one of this style I&#x27;ve purchased, LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Worked great for 6 months, then sparked and died. Almost set my hair on fire.</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer for only 10 minutes a day and after 4 months it started shorting out.  I bought this one because my previous hair dryer, which I had used for a few years, was also made by Revlon, and it was a recommended affordable product on a consumer website.  I would NOT recommend this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer does what I need it too and doesn&#x27;t cost an outrageous amount.</li>
    <li> Nice product and works good. Price is really low and I would recommend this to everyone for a more general hair dryer requirement</li>
    <li> As this is my first foray into hairdryers, I cannot profess to be an expert, but this meets my expectations. It takes a little while to warm up, but it gets the job done. The price was right, so I have no reason to complain. 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t blow me out of the water, it just does the job.</li>
    <li> After  doing a little research about which hair blow dryers would be worth the money spent, I settled on the Revlon, which was highly recommended. The power is adjustable and so is the temperature. I haven&#x27;t used both of the attachments yet, but the one I use every day is great. The only bummer is that after the blow dryer has completed the job of drying my hair, the attachment is super hot to the touch. Other than that minor thing, I&#x27;m really satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and she has been happy with it. It has a nice strong flow. It&#x27;s as loud as any other dryer we&#x27;ve had, but we don&#x27;t expect hair dryers to be quiet. So far, it&#x27;s worked out well.</li>
    <li> This is a really good, functional hair dryer.  Bought it to replace an aging T3 that was much more expensive, but this Revlon dryer dries just as quickly and my hair is shinier.  My personal observation is that all tourmaline dryers impart much more shine when new, but for me there is no chance I&#x27;ll go back to the T3 price range as long as this Revlon product is on the market.</li>
    <li> This was a much needed replacement for an old hair dryer.  It is very lightweight and has improved the look and feel of my fine, straight hair--softer and fuller.  What a difference this dryer has made, for the fraction of the price of one salon visit!</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy/curly hair and decided I needed a diffuser because my hair is getting so long that the curls were flattening (triangle head). I have been air drying my hair for years and I don&#x27;t even know where my old hairdryer is, so I decided it&#x27;s time for a new one and I will try to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted an inexpensive, dependable dryer with a diffuser attachement. This one works just fine. 3 heat settings and high/low setting. I had forgotten how good curls look when diffused after washing. :) Definitely recommend if you have curly hair and just want a a good ol&#x27; dependable diffuser, nothing special.</li>
    <li> Ok, do these people actually use the items before they put them on the market?  The buttons are directly where your hand grabs the handle, so I&#x27;m constantly turning my dryer off in the middle of using it.  Good grief.</li>
    <li> This is a very good, lightweight dryer.  I have long hair and it takes very little time and effort to dry my hair.  Even my 6 year old daughter can handle the dryer very well to dry her own hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer. It&#x27;s reasonably priced, lightweight, and fairly quiet. The only problem I&#x27;ve seen (as have other reviewers) is that it&#x27;s easy to hit the switches and either turn off the dryer, lower the temperature, etc. Overall, though it&#x27;s an excellent buy in quality and cost.</li>
    <li> This dryer was not strong enough to dry my hair, which is past my shoulders and medium thickness. It got hot enough but there wasn&#x27;t enough air flowing through the dryer. I gave it away to a friend that has very short, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I just got this blow dryer about a month ago and I love it, it&#x27;s easy to handle and doesn&#x27;t make your hair as frizzy as other dryers.  But there&#x27;s one strange problem, the paint on the handle is coming off.  It comes off on your hand when drying your hair and it&#x27;s making the handle sticky.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, very nice designed, powerful, it came with the two adapters that work ok, recommended. the item arrives at time, and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> So noisy and hardly any heat.</li>
    <li> FYI if this post under the name of Gerard, he is my hubby. We share the same account.  Love this hair dryer! I am glad that I bought it. My other hair dryer was a very old Gillette blow dryer. Sorry I waited so long to update. It weighs less than it looks. Happy with the three temperature selections. If you have long hair, be careful not to get it where it can be sucked into the air intake screen. This has happened to me twice. Both times my own fault for allowing my hair to fall over the dryer.  Hair drys nicely, and quickly. I would buy this dryer again.</li>
    <li> BEST DRYER EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used it before to dry off my man bits and it didn&#x27;t over heat them or anything.</li>
    <li> Warm and strong wind, low noise, cheap.and so on. Warm and strong wind, low noise, cheap.and so on. attachments are cool</li>
    <li> If this hair dryer actually had any power to it, it might be okay. But it took me about twice as long to dry my hair as my previous hair dryer! I guess you get what you pay for. I&#x27;d only recommend this dryer to people with shorter and thinner hair styles. One positive was the shipping from amazon was great.</li>
    <li> No problem with order. Arrived quickly, a little odd holding base of hair dryer and straightening the hair, I guess I will get use to. Great but for the money.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair dryer for curly locks.  It is powerful and the settings are just right.  Sometimes my fingers flip the switches accidentally with them located on the handle.  There seems to be an adhesive on the end of the hair dryer to help the diffuser stay on better.  But when you remove the diffuser, the sticky stuff is still there - kind of gunky.  Not a big deal and doesn&#x27;t effect the dryers performance, just gunky.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s lightweight. It also dried fast. I have thick hair and it did not dry it out while drying. But it only lasted 5 months.</li>
    <li> I was initially skeptical because it was very cheap, but I have been pleasantly surprised. I have been using this dryer for a year now and it works great. I didn&#x27;t use it a lot when I was natural but it used to give me a great blowout, and now that I am textlaxed it still works great. Fast drying and the diffuser actually works.</li>
    <li> This dryer dried my hair in half the time of my old one.  My sister said the same thing.  People also commented on my hair looking better.  Great value!</li>
    <li> Works great, there&#x27;s not much to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not that into hair driers since I&#x27;m a male plus I have short hair - we bought this just to dry our hair after taking a shower and it does it fine and quick. The dryer feels nice, not too heavy and not to light. It includes various accessories which I&#x27;m guessing make the experience better but I wouldn&#x27;t know firsthand. It has more options that what I&#x27;m used to (hot and cold), which is great since we plan to use it on our cat. The options are hot, warm and cold plus high and low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is long enough even for big bathrooms. Not sure if it&#x27;s a $120 value dryer but for what Amazon is selling it - I can&#x27;t really complain. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do well and it has extras that make it more valuable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see with time how it holds up.</li>
    <li> Speed is not as fast and strong as my previously owned blow dryers, but this really drys my hair quickly! It works well, but I wished it was able to fold so it is easier to store, but its fine. I made it work. Also the diffuser doesn&#x27;t really serve a purpose for me, so I would have been fine without it. Aside from that I love the dryer and the other additional attachment.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my new blow dryer. It&#x27;s so light weight and it dries my thick hair quickly with lots of shine and volume.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer when my T3 dryer stopped heating up after 5 years of drying twice a week.  This Revlon was rated very highly so I gave it a try.  WHAT A FABULOUS PURCHASE!!  I have used it a few times now and here are my impressions:  -It is lightweight- feels the same as my old T3, has a very similar design of the handle and ergonomics in general.  -Has more power and drying choices than the T-3.  -I did not notice any difference in drying time or the quality of the blowdry in comparison with the T3- it was great!  -Fairly quiet  If you want a T3 clone at a fraction of the cost (or for that matter a great dryer in general)- look no further!  p.s. my only complaint is that the cord is too short.  Another foot would be perfect!</li>
    <li> I loved this dryer! And it lasted me exactly one year, which I guess isn&#x27;t bad for $20!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently it stopped working, it would not even turn on unless the cord was bent. So I had to get creative and hold it a certain way to dry my hair. I started noticing a burning smell and I will not use or purchase this dryer again. They need to change this because I have noticed I am not the only one having the same issue! Just be careful. Otherwise it worked great for one year.</li>
    <li> Having long thick hair, I sometimes dread using a hairdryer. They can become so heavy and painful to use after a while. This hair dryer is light enough that my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired holding it and yet it seems to dry my hair faster.. The controls are well placed and easy to use also.&lt;br /&gt;Well, 4 months after I wrote the glowing review on this dryer (perhaps I should have used it for longer than one month before reviewing), it started making horrible noises and giving off a burning electrical smell. It was never dropped or mishandled, nor was there any clog at the inlet, so I know it was a manufacturing defect. Having to pay postage to return under warranty and include $6 for return postage made using the warranty service a financially stupid idea. It went in the trash. Sorry Revlon, this item is a hazard.</li>
    <li> Positives Are: it&#x27;s light, leaves hair silky, good price.  Negatives are:  big and feels bulky (I have long hair), cord twists into a mess, buttons are too easy to switch into wrong settings.</li>
    <li> Works well with the diffuser and low-speed to quickly dry my very thick, curly hair.  It does have a cold-shot button on it.  My old dryer was ceramic but not tourmaline, and that must be the difference in how nicely this one works.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome.  I really like the attachment with all the nubs on it.  I have really thick and long hair, and it dries my hair really quickly.</li>
    <li> Love love love this hair dryer and it was such a good deal!&lt;br /&gt;Things I care about: weight, how loud it is, and drying ability... This has all of them.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty light so it doesn&#x27;t hurt my arm when I blow dry my hair. Also it drys really fast compared to my Conair. It is also fairly quiet, no screeching noise. Best of all, the concentrator stays on sturdy and doesn&#x27;t turn every time I move it. I love this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I bought this 3 years ago and it is still working perfectly.</li>
    <li> Good product...much quieter than I thought it would be and drys hair fast.</li>
    <li> Very nice dryer - light and pretty quiet.</li>
    <li> Bought this in August 2014, and it only survived for 10 months before it quit working.  I wrote the company and they sent me a replacement, but that replacement died after 4 months.  I was really surprised because this was the most reviewed and highest rated on Amazon, but I&#x27;ve learned my lesson; I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it has a diffuser . It works great but the diffuser attachment falls off every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Well, it sparked and spit and fumed and died less than six months after purchase.  :-(  Previously, I wrote this: &amp;#34;Love this dryer!  Fast, efficient, easy to control with thumb.&amp;#34;  I have to give it two stars because it really was great...for the very short lifespan.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer at an exceptional price!  The highest heat is not so hot that it can damage your hair.  I will reccomend to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Its super light compared to my old blow dryer and its really powerful....  My hair is past my shoulders and medium thickness and this does a wonderful job of drying....</li>
    <li> My hair stylist told me my hair was breaking due to the type of dryer that I was using. I looked at the professional dryers and they cost $100 and up. I ordered this to see if it would work and I was amazed with the results. My hair didn&#x27;t frizz with it and feels softer than when I used my old dryer. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay a lot of money for a good hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Wish it was quieter, but it&#x27;s a good drier..</li>
    <li> Fast, gentle, light, hair dryer.  No frizz, quick drying results.  The diffuser attachment is rather large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good gentle air. The dryer is very light to hold and has a cold setting to finish the job.  The motor can be rattling and rather loud but over all performance is excellent for daily use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I first read about this hair dryer in a magazine at my beauty salon. It was reviewed side by side with two other hair dryers that were well over $100.  I figured it can&#x27;t be any worse than other hair dryers that you buy at a drugstore, so I gave it a shot.  My shoulder length, color-treated hair is  very thick and really retains moisture so it can take forever to dry.  This hair dryer has cut my dry time in half.  I&#x27;ve used it all week and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.  It is very lightweight and came with both the diffuser and a concentrator attachment which is nice. My only complaint it is very loud.  Whoever said it is quiet must have had a hair dryer with a jet engine on it before owning this one.</li>
    <li> Breezy. Dries my hair. Not sure what else to say?</li>
    <li> I had a $125. Dryer that blew up in my hand! Was in love with it for YEARS but obviously needed a new one! After lots of research I chose this dryer.  When I got it I was Sceptical of how light it was...but it works great! Dries my hair quickly and with less frizz!! I love this dryer!!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works well/ There have been no problems - have had it for nearly 2 months. Dries my hair quickly and w/o &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this dryer!  It is not too noisy.  It does not get extremely hot, but just right.  Leaves my hair nice and shiny.  And I love that the back comes off for easy cleaning.  Now I won&#x27;t have a problem with it getting clogged up!  It is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> The dryer works very well and has multiple settings!</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for almost exactly one year. It has worked fairly well until recently, when I started to smell funny and turn off on its own. The filter was clean, and I could see no other problem with the dryer. Then, just today, sparks flew out of the dryer as I was using it. I have never had a dryer do that before. Obviously it isn&#x27;t a safe product and I will discontinue using it.</li>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like regular blow dryers.  The attachments work great and my daughter is jealous.</li>
    <li> Works well. Rated best buy on consumer reports. Very fair price. Attachments add value to it. Settings proved great variety.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairdryer for the price.  The high setting has a lot of power and I like the low and high heat settings.</li>
    <li> I order on Amazon ALL the time, have for years, this is the first time I have felt compelled to submit a review.  This dryer arrived, and I was immediately disappointed in how light weight it was.  Not that I was after something heavy and cumbersome, but this is SO light I thought it would not be good at all.  Was I wrong!  I have course, thick, shoulder length wavy hair.  Using the diffuser attachment, my hair was completely dry in under 10 minutes.  My $80 dryer takes twice that long!  My hair is full of bounce, body, shine, doesn&#x27;t feel dry, and there is NO frizz.  I am AMAZED.  Definitely going to order a back up!  If you are wavering on this purchase, don&#x27;t - this is a great product and an excellent value.</li>
    <li> LIght-weight, not overrun with needless setting options, small enough grip so not to give my hand a cramp, does the job, not expensive.</li>
    <li> Bought a cheapie just to fight a foot fungus, but soon realized it was none the less, a cheapie. Ordered this, and I have 3X the dryer now. The switches are handy, but easily mis-toggled in my hands.</li>
    <li> Very good drysy hair quickly and effectively</li>
    <li> Not quite as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped but good hairdryer at a very reasonable price</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price .... The attachment is a bit bulky but it works well .... It is a bit difficult switching attachments since it connects so tightly and won&#x27;t come off easily...</li>
    <li> Low fan setting is actually quite strong.</li>
    <li> this hair dryer was to replace a older one I have.  I wanted something more powerful.  It is but not as powerful as I would have liked.  came with all the attachments and works well.  If your looking for a very powerful dryer I would not purchase this one.  But it does the job</li>
    <li> I like very much it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair</li>
    <li> My wife used this hair dryer almost every day for a total of 389 days since I ordered it out.  It&#x27;s not expensive and I suppose you get what you pay for.  I still have our old hair dryer we bought nearly 30 years ago and it works just fine.  I&#x27;d just hoped this Revlon dryer would have worked for a few years.  Maybe \\&quot;they just don&#x27;t make them like they used to\\&quot;.  She plugged it into a ground fault outlet this morning and the plug smoked and shot out sparks.  Not only did it trip the outlet&#x27;s built in breaker but it tripped the breaker in the power panel also.</li>
    <li> It sounds loudly and annoying</li>
    <li> This is a very good hair dryer. It&#x27;s Ionic/Tourmaline/Ceramic which is supposed to be easy on hair and minimize frizz. My hair is coarse and kinky and after drying it&#x27;s smooth, frizz &amp; static free. I use it to dry my hair and then use a flat iron, so I haven&#x27;t used the diffuser and concentrator attachments. The dryer has Hot/warm, low/high settings and a cool shot. In my opinion, it&#x27;s relatively quiet. It also has a vent on the back that you have to clean out, which is a new feature than what I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s a good thing because a strand of my hair got sucked into the back of the last one (what do you even do about that?) The directions are stated very clear and tell you how to take care of your hair dryer. Revlon is a great trusted brand, and for $16 this is fantastic. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I looked on Consumer Reports before purchasing this hair dryer.  It wasn&#x27;t the top rated one - but it was in the top seven.  I am so glad I purchased it!! It works GREAT and I love that it has the different settings!  GREAT HAIR DRYER!!!!</li>
    <li> A hair dryer review by a bald guy is somewhat amusing.  I bought this for my wife who luckily is not bald.  The dryer is quieter than her last one which was supposed to be quiet and certainly wasn&#x27;t.  Quietness is very subjective while this is quieter I don&#x27;t see how all you haired folks stand that noise for the length of time it takes to dry your hair.  This does a good job.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair dryer twice since I received it yesterday. I honestly am amazed.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a junky hair dryer for a long time, so I finally decided to invest in another one. I only regret that I didn&#x27;t do this sooner!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot  believe how smooth my hair is when I am done drying it. I have the volume minus the frizz, which I didn&#x27;t even know was possible.&lt;br /&gt;I have long (a few inches past my shoulders) medium-thick hair, and it dries it in a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that is kind of heavy. My arm gets sore from holding it up too long.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I highly recommend this hair-dryer! I&#x27;m glad I bought it :)</li>
    <li> This thing works. Nothing special. It&#x27;s a good price so I believe this to be a decent deal. Had mine for  a couple months and it seems to be holding up fine</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer, I don&#x27;t particularly style my hair with it, but it has those different positions, so it&#x27;s really nice to use and very light. Very easy to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer, it&#x27;s very light weight, which I find a big plus, I have had short hair for years and I wanted to grow it out but hate blow drying cause since I have gotten older I find it harder to hold a heavy dryer this dryer is so lightweight and gets the job done quickly. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer.  I have tried many and so far this is the best.  I have medium long hair an it dries it in seconds.  I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old hair dryer which was supposed to be a \\&quot;quiet\\&quot; one but it was the loudest dryer I have ever owned.  This dryer is much quieter and light, works great!</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer and the price makes it even better since it&#x27;s performance compares really well with the more expensive dryers.  I have shoulder length relaxed hair with fine strands &amp; medium density and I was able to dry my hair using the warm heat &amp; hi fan speed combo in around 15  minutes.  It left my hair silky smooth &amp; full of body and best of all ... my arm wasn&#x27;t tired!!    You&#x27;ve probably guessed already, but my favourite feaures about this dryer are:  - lightweight - it actually is light compared to other dryers  - the dual settings - they allow you to combine the desired heat setting (hot/warm) with the fan speed (hi/low).  This is great for people like me who absolutely cannot stand a hot dryer but don&#x27;t have the patience with the diminished air flow of the lower settings.  - ionic technology - leaves your hair so smooth and shiny with lots of body and anyone with my type of hair knows that achieving volume is a minor miracle all by itself.  - design - fits comfortably in your hand, the buttons are easy to get to and well placed so that you don&#x27;t accidentally change the setting.  It also has a hinged endcap to make cleaning the unit easy, which I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll appreciate after I&#x27;ve had it a while.</li>
    <li> I had this dryer for about a month and it just stopped working in the middle of drying my hair.  Nothing I could do would get it started again.  I emailed the company, but got no response.</li>
    <li> After about a month of using this hair drier, I noticed my hair was starting to get a lot of split ends and break a LOT more than usual.  I finally figured out this hair drier gets too hot and was damaging my hair.  Needless to say, I will be getting rid of it.</li>
    <li> OWNED: 4 years. [Edited on 2014]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR: Wavy, average thickness hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOISE: High setting is noisy, but that is expected. Low setting is still somewhat noisy, but quiet enough that I can use it at night without feeling like I disrupt people in other rooms. If you worry too much about noise, you are going to buy a weak hair dryer that never dries you hair. Don&#x27;t worry about noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEAT: High and low settings both dry my hair well. Usually I start with high and then switch to low when I only have a few spots left to dry. Does not overheat. With my old hair dryer, I would have to press the cool button after a couple moments in the high setting because it heated up too much. I have not had that problem with this hair dryer. The low setting is a bit slow (~10 min) to dry my shoulder length hair completely, so I never use only the low setting unless I have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL: Good. No smell. Other hair dryers sometimes smell burnt, but this one does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHINE/SOFTNESS: I think my hair is shiny and soft, but I do not know how much to attribute to the hair drier and how much to attribute to conditioners and other things. Anyway, this hair dryer does not make my hair frizzy. No frizziness! It leaves it smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND? Yes!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my broken hair dryer for the guest room. I dont use it much only tried it when it first came in. Works well.</li>
    <li> I Love the differant settings. Everyone that has tried it while visiting, wants to know where I got it they Love it too. There is alot to say for this product. It does dry faster, I can tell a differance in the look and feel of my hair when I am done. I Just Love it.</li>
    <li> Finally a hair dryer for naturally curly hair.  The diffuser is average size or slightly larger than other dryers I&#x27;ve purchased.  More importantly it snaps on, so I don&#x27;t have to chase it rolling around the bathroom floor after it falls off.  The dryer puts out plenty of hot air, but it doesn&#x27;t blow so strongly that my curls are all fuzzy and tangled when I&#x27;m done.  Very, very happy with this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I need a hairdryer that dries my hair fast and leaves it smooth and manageable. The Revlon is it! I have used many hairdryers, several 4-5 times the price of the Revlon RV544. The others are Tourmaline Ionic and cost a fortune, but I always come back to this hairdryer. It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use. My hair is silky smooth in no time! I gave the more expensive ones to my husband and teenagers, but they kept coming to my room to use my Revlon. I bought each of them one so now I don&#x27;t have to share mine. Who says good quality has to break the bank! The Revlon RV544 is the perfect example!</li>
    <li> I could have literally bought 13 of these hair dryers for the price of one T3, and I can&#x27;t imagine it would have been any better. My fine hair dries fast and smoothly. It took some getting used to the fact that the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting isn&#x27;t consistently hot, but it doesn&#x27;t adversely affect the outcome, so I decided it is not a problem. Maybe it&#x27;s actually just keeping my hair from getting dried out and damaged. My shoulder length hair dries totally in 7 minutes. With the concentrator attachment I have excellent control. If this thing were bright and colorful like the other ones I shopped for it would be perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer at a local drugstore when they had them on sale for 50% off so it cost me $15 + tax. The first one I brought home didn&#x27;t work at all, so I returned it and got a second one. The second one never worked right, but since I threw my old dryer away as soon as I opened the first one, I TRIED to use it for about a week, before ordering a new one and throwing this one away. The switch to change between high and low speeds is a rocker switch (not a sliding switch) with high on the top, off in the middle and low on the bottom. NEVER did it work. Once used on high, I could turn it off, but not switch to low. After a couple of days, it switched to low, and then never switched back to high again. Junk. I ordered the Conair Pro (the orange one) from Amazon, have been using it for a couple of weeks, and like it SO much better.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of a new hair dryer, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for one.  I read some reviews, and I was happy to find that the recommended hair dryer was offered at Amazon for under $20.  As other reviewers stated, the buttons can interfere with its use, because they are placed where you have to hold the dryer.  I can deal with it, though, and my hair dries quickly.  I don&#x27;t burn myself because of the lower heat function, which is nice.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer because I recently got a perm.  It is my first blow dryer I ever had and I am very pleased with it.  I have had no problems with it and it works to my expectations.  No regrets.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair that gets very puffy espcially in the humidity. my hair has been looking really good since I started using this dryer. The dryer has cut at least 5 minutes off my usual 20 min drying time. The plastic on the outside is very lightweight,but feels like it may break if dropped. So far, I really like it, and the price is right!</li>
    <li> Good power and temperatures.</li>
    <li> I used it e few times i felt this procuct is very good, i love it</li>
    <li> Great dryer, great price.  Fast delivery, very pleased.</li>
    <li> So after my professional expensive dryer finally died I obviously needed a new one.  We are going away in a few days and really don&#x27;t have money in my budget right now.  So I went right to the Internet for reviews and was about to buy or try the babyliss 2800 which on a few sites got great reviews until I saw this one last minute.  Then I saw price and thought was too good to be true.  Well I went out today and bought it and wow all I can say is that I wish my professional dryer would have dyed sooner!  Only after one blow dry I am impressed with this dryers performance.  I am a hair snob and a perfectionist so I felt the need to write this review.  My hair is semi fine and will frizz without good product and a good dryer</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t blow dry hair fast. I think it is a weak hair dryer. Maybe mine was defected. I exchanged it for the Remington Pearl which I like so much more.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Just as good if not better than the expensive dryers. My daughter has super thick hair and this helps out better than any other hair dryer I have had before.</li>
    <li> Fast, light weight, concentrator works great. Leaves my hair a bit dry though.</li>
    <li> This dryer is easy to use and has 4 air/heat combo settings, plus a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; air button which is nice to use at the end to cool off your head after blowing warm/hot air on it.  I&#x27;m not sure what \\&quot;tourmaline ionic\\&quot; does any different from a regular hair dryer, but it is easy to hold and works fine.  Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair dryer for the gym, and this one was compact (great in the locker) and it dries my hair fast. It wasn&#x27;t expensive, and it does the job.</li>
    <li> Bought this dryer for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. She has very thick hair and has complained about previous dryers not getting hot enough or blowing the air hard enough to get her hair completely dry, however this is not a problem when using the Revlon dryer. On a side note I would also take into account several reviews from individuals with thinner hair saying this dryer gets too hot, and can damage hair if not used properly. Overall this is an awesome dryer for the price, I would highly recommend this for people with normal to thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this hair dryer. The first one lasted five  years and I only had to replace it because I damaged the cord. Is the fastest and lightest hair dryer I have ever owned!!</li>
    <li> This drier worked great for the two months that it worked . . . but it pooped out quickly and too late for me to return.  Ugh!</li>
    <li> I mistakenly thought this was a full size dryer when I ordered it one morning frustrated that my old dryer died mid-dry. It arrived the next day (thank you Prime!) and at first sight I was disappointed thinking there was no way this little thing could match up to my former full size dryer. Holy cow was I wrong. It dried my hair in half the time and at was light enough that I didn&#x27;t get my normal arm and neck strain. Amazing little machine for the price!</li>
    <li> This was a great dryer for the couple of months that it worked.  It was light weight and had great heat.  I have thick long curly hair and was able to Cut my drying time in half . Very disappointing that this dryer didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Needed a blow dryer for my gym bag. It&#x27;s a full size dryer but I like it every bit as much as my regular dryer. This dryer does not dry my fragile curly/wavy like the standard dryer at the fitness center. The included large diffuser would be great for long hair. The other attachment focuses the airstream with presicion brush during styling.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how light this dryer is!  It is so quiet that it makes my old dryer sounded like a semi truck.  LOL  I have used the dryer and find that it does not blow more than it dries, like other dryiers.  That makes it much easier on hair.  I have never used hair dryer attachments and probably won&#x27;t use the ones that came with this one.  So, I can&#x27;t help you there.  When you first use it, remember to depress the red button on the cord.  It will not turn on, unless you do this. You only have to do this once.  It is a safety feature.  If you have small children, you can disable the red button, so kids won&#x27;t turn it on and leave it.  Remember, it is very quiet.  Overall I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Had this for a little over a year.  Worked well, until this morning.  Sparks shot from base of the handle and it smelled of burning.</li>
    <li> came in quickly, very happy!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife when her old unit died. Read other reviews before buying, and can confirm that the unit lives up to expectations - performs well, and can&#x27;t beat the price. My wife is very satisfied with this unit.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer five years ago, and I&#x27;m back to buy another one. It really does dry my long hair very quickly. It&#x27;s held up well. The plug seems to have cracked, and it won&#x27;t turn on now. For the price, I think it&#x27;s held up really well. My only complaint is that the silver finish on the plastic hair dryer peels off. It doesn&#x27;t look perfect, but it works great.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, and this hair dryer just changed my life when it comes to helping me get ready in the morning! It dries my hair super quickly, and significantly reduces frizziness, which is much appreciated! So far I&#x27;ve got no complaints for this item!</li>
    <li> Beside this being the loudest blow dryer I have ever used, the buttons are upside down. Who does that, really?</li>
    <li> The blow dryer does not work right. It colds hot and cold when the dryer is on. I must have gotten a defective model.</li>
    <li> With the promotional certificates plus the already low price I was able to get this for $15.97.  Wow!  The dryer works really great.  It was slow shipping though.  It took 1 month to get the item.  It works great - I tried it one time so far and it was nice.  I considered buying one of the $100 + blow dryers and this one was right up there in performance so I am glad I went with it.  It has nice power plus it is lightweight. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Was disappointed that it wasnt quiet, as it was advertised.  Other than that, it works fine</li>
    <li> I like it, but it went on sale for another $5.00 cheaper this week at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have long wavy hair and I&#x27;ve been through my share of hairdryers. I used to dread washing my hair because drying took so long. This dryer cut my time in half! Great product!</li>
    <li> Hair dryer is exactly as described and it does a great job. I love it.</li>
    <li> lightweight and wonderful</li>
    <li> I had an 1875-watt hair dryer that I thought I liked, but when it finally died, I checked the reviews on Amazon and decided to get the Revlon 1875 Tourmaline Model RV544.  I had no idea what I was missing in the past!  It&#x27;s so light, my arm and shoulder don&#x27;t tire from holding it.  And the best thing is it dries my hair in half the time it used to.  It doesn&#x27;t seem hotter; evidently it&#x27;s just more forceful.  I love it and would highly recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very powerful so takes a while to dry your hair ... I have flat irons that I use as well .. if I didn&#x27;t then i would want a different hair dryer ... good as a basic dryer</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this dryer. After doing some research at consumer reports, this dryer was rated higher than the T3 dryers.  I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone who needs a high powered dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer at the end of September 2014. It seemed to work alright for a while. All of the attachments fit and worked well. After 7 months it would start to smell like something was burning when I turned it on, then it got a short in it despite how careful I am with the cord while storing and during use. Yesterday as I was using it, I heard two loud popping noises and then it started on fire where the cord connects to the dryer! This dryer didn&#x27;t last a year. I used a Babyliss Pro prior to purchasing this dryer and it lasted four years so this was a disappointing follow up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two T3 blowdryers in the last few yrs ..only to have them both fail me within 12 months of using them.. One only lasted a couple of months.  My sister also had several of the T3 dryers and had the same problem.  We both have thick frizzy hair and agreed the Revlon did as good a job straightening and smoothing as the T3.</li>
    <li> I go through a lot of hair dryers as I have curly hair that I straighten most often, and my hair is also thick and long.  This hair dryer, not only dries my hair but is hot enough to straighen it in record time.  Also with the diffuser, I can make my hair dry and curly in a matter of minutes instead of waiting for it to air dry.  I recommend this hair dryer to anyone as a definite must have!</li>
    <li> bought as damaged box sale . good deal, blower inside original wraping</li>
    <li> Nice look, well made, and great price.  We bought it for the guest bath, but won&#x27;t be surprised to see it in the Master.</li>
    <li> Light, but powerful!  Literally dries my hair in half the time, should&#x27;ve bought a long time ago.  Excellent performance for the price!</li>
    <li> Some reviews say it&#x27;s &#x27;light weight&#x27;. I think it just feels cheap. The filter in the back of the hair dryer is really wide, so I&#x27;m not sure what lint/dust it will actually be catching. The speed of air coming out is &#x27;so so&#x27; at best. It was definitely not any quicker than my old hair dryer. I am mostly returning this because I don&#x27;t think it will last long. With the filter being so wide, I have a feeling that the motor will blow out within a year...so I&#x27;d rather find a better hair dryer than wait for the inevitable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my daughter for Christmas. She used it once, I used it once, after that it no longer worked.</li>
    <li> Worth the money. Spend a little more and get this one. I was gonna get the cheaper one,but after reading all the reviews,i got this one,and well,never better</li>
    <li> It does the job.  I appreciate the efficiency and speed. My hair is past my shoulders, but takes so little time to dry that I can wash it without planning ahead.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome. I have a lot of hair. It helps me dry it much quicker than cheaper hair dryers.</li>
    <li> until the Hot/Warm switch got stuck.  Now it is a Warm only hair dryer.  The two rocker switches feel cheap and are not designed well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rob</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy here, but I am quite satisfied.  Mostly I keep the diffuser on, and never use the dryer once my hair is just somewhat damp.  Also, to protect my aging, dry hair, I keep my setting on warm, not hot, and use low fan.  I am small, so I wish this dryer were a bit lighter, though as dryers go it is not heavy.  It is simple,works well and the price is right.</li>
    <li> so far so good with this product. satisfied customer. I have used it several times to blow out my hair and it dries so quickly.</li>
    <li> It was great while it worked, but I think it should last a little longer than five months.  Although it is a pain, I am thankful for good customer service and Amazon agreed to return it.</li>
    <li> Really nice for the $.  My girlfriend ended up &amp;#34;stealing&amp;#34; this from me and giving me her old Revlon.  I pretty much only used it to pamper my dog after a bath, he loves it.</li>
    <li> Worked well for almost 2 years (used every other or every third day on my long hair). I&#x27;m giving this dryer two stars because I feel it is poor quality and dangerous. It shot sparks out of the power cord where it connects to the dryer which burned my bathroom counter top and a towel, then proceeded to smoke as if there was some internal burning.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how my would not  even turn on..pretty upset ! Waited for the dryer and then wen I got it it was damaged :(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She thinks it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever picked for her (unfortunately).</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer from another seller about a year ago when my last trusty ionic dryer finally died. For the past couple of weeks it hasn&#x27;t worked well - as it would only turn on when held at a particular angle. I knew something must be wrong with the cord. I really don&#x27;t use it often in the summer, but when I tried to quickly dry my hair this morning, it threw sparks. Needless to say, I turned it right off and unplugged it. There is visible pitting/holes in the cord at the handle, as if the current was too hot for the insulation and had been melting it.</li>
    <li> diffuser gives my straight hair curls</li>
    <li> Disappointed that it did not come with the hook to hang it from as shown in the picture but otherwise very happy with it</li>
    <li> This is honestly the fastest dryer I have ever used on my hair.  It cuts my drying time in half!  The price is right also!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer does a good job and I am well pleased wtih it.  You would have to spend some serious money to get anything significantly better.</li>
    <li> This dryer, while lightweight and easy to hold, blows too hard and fast on low speed, and too cool on hot setting. It&#x27;s very difficult to get the right speed and heat setting for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted an ionic dryer for a while, ever since the T3 came out with all that hype. After reading enough positive reveiws about this dryer, and ionic dryers in general, I finally purchased this one today. I&#x27;m so impressed!! My hair is bouncier, shinier, has no frizzies, and dried in about 3/4th of the usual time. DH, who is really clueless about such things, even commented that it looked better than usual. It also feels really soft - which is nice, as both my skin &amp; hair tend toward dryness. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have pretty fine hair - but alot of it (i.e., the hair follicles are thin, but I&#x27;ve got a lot of them.) My hair generally looks shiny on it&#x27;s own, is stick straight, but has NO volume or bounce. I turned it on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; and \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting to get it 80% dry, then put the concentrator on and turned it down to \\&quot;low\\&quot; (it was drying too fast!) to finish. I use a 3 1/2 inch Marilyn Tuxedo brush to finish drying in sections, concentrating at roots and ends. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend trying this dryer before forking over $300 for the T3 or another model. I can&#x27;t see how those more expensive ones could do a better job.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I really love this item. It is just as described and a great buy with the flat iron. Glad I did.</li>
    <li> My 3-year old Conair 1875 watt just broke so I bought this one because of the good reviews, I&#x27;ve used it for over a week now: The weight is acceptable but not much lighter than my old hair dryer (so I&#x27;m a bit dissapointed with its claim). The diffuser is bulky and hard to use so I just don&#x27;t use it. I blow dry my hair everyday and have medium length coarse hair and this dryer does cut my drying time about half (from 20 mins to 10 mins). It is however, very loud and I now use earplugs when drying my hair.</li>
    <li> This replaces my old one, which blew something loudly one day and quit. It is a bit heavy weight, but overall I have been very happy with it. The controls and attachments are helpful.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife because the dryer she had drove me crazy with noise. This one is much quieter. Very good item.</li>
    <li> I had boughten this as a gift which turned out to be an aweful idea. It is way too loud and the force of air is way too strong. It literally causes loss of hearing and causes your hair to look like you were just caught in a tornado. I do not recommend this hair dryer for anyone.</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist and have been for 20 years. I read an article that this dryer compared to the T3 (which is a couple HUNDRED dollars). I figured at this price, how could I not just give it a try. Well... I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer! Quiet, light, powerful and dryies my hair FAST. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good blow dryer just wish they had designed the back so that long hair doesn&#x27;t get sucked in so easily.</li>
    <li> For $20 I decided to try this dryer.  The previous reviews stated that this dryer was rated as well as the high end models.  It is a great hair dryer for the price and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair like my previous Remington model did.  I don&#x27;t really like the diffuser attachment, but perhaps if you have thick hair you might like it.   Otherwise, I would recommend this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon and the decent price.  I have been wanting to try an \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; hair dryer but did not want to spend $$$ on one to try it.  This one by Revlon has been well worth my money so far.  It really does seem to leave my hair softer, shinier, and with less frizz than my other former dryers.  (most of these have been Revlon or Conair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is relatively quiet compared to my others, has two speed/heat settings; a cold shot button; a diffuser and concentrator attachment; a decently long cord; is lightweight; back part comes off to clean the filter; drys my hair fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak for the longevity of the product.  I do know my previous revlon dryers have lasted several year; I hope this one also does.  I will post an update if it dies before it should.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer about a year ago, I have thick curly hair and this blow dryer seemed to be ok since I just straightened a small part of my hair, the very first time I tried to do all my hair which was last week, it started acting weird and started making a weird and scary noise. I can&#x27;t use it anymore and I&#x27;ll buy another one, definitely not the same one though!!</li>
    <li> I like the smaller size of this hair dryer. It&#x27;s not heavy and not as loud as my old one. No static in hair. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My hair dries quickly and has more volume and shine! My hair feels so silky and soft. Everyone needs this dryer! No problems!</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer in January 2011 and put it in the trash can in October 2011.  From the beginning, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this dryer.  The on-off power switch is poorly placed and/or poorly designed and it took some time before I quit accidentally turning the hair dryer off while drying my hair (which happened multiple times every time I used the hair dryer).  This dryer has two heat settings.  I soon discovered that use of the high heat resulted in my hand getting burned because there are screws in the handle that heat up and cannot be avoided.  The only way to avoid getting burned is to use the lower heat setting.  Then, less than nine months after I purchased this dryer, I threw it in the trash after the heating element went out altogether.  Good riddance!</li>
    <li> We purchased this hair dryer 17 months ago. It worked great until this week when sparks flew from the handle and there was an awful burning smell. My teenage daughter was using it at the time and threw it to the ground and unplugged it. Not a safe product.</li>
    <li> Dries hair very fast.  Quiet compared to other dryers I have had in the past..  I would recommend this product to a friend</li>
    <li> Very disappointing-did not do any better than my plain-vanilla Conair dryer at minimizing frizzies or adding body to my hair.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this dryer - I was looking for a dryer with diffuser and pointy attachment (technical term?).  For a few weeks it was great.  My only complaint was that the screen protecting the fan in the back wasn&#x27;t fine enough so my long hair would sometimes get pulled in.  But i figured this was because my hair is super long and I just needed to be more careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then night before last, I was drying my hair and started to smell burnt plastic. And the handle of the dryer got really hot.  So hot that it burned my hand and the plastic. melted.  Actually melted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I still had the box, i&#x27;d return it for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATES: Amazon has since sent me a replacement dryer, and it&#x27;s working great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon customer service is easily the best of any company in the history of ever.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. I bought it for her birthday. She says that it takes half as much time to get ready in the morning because the blow dryer gets the job done quickly. She has long hair. It goes down to her mid back.    I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It works..but I had a blow dryer pervious to this one, but dumb me forgot the models name. Anyway, that other blow dryer I had was way stronger with the air flow.</li>
    <li> I needed a hairdryer to quickly dry my hair in the mornings. I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair. Really helps me not look like a wet dog.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer, and soon realized it does not include a &amp;#34;loop&amp;#34; to hang it. As you can see, a loop is shown on the photo and is also shown on the instruction booklet that came with it. It worked fine, but I need the loop to hang it in my small space.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair dryer!  It&#x27;s not loud, dries quickly and my hair shines!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get that hot!</li>
    <li> Great weight, heat good and the speeds are just right.  For the price this tourmaline dryer meets all expectations, good product.</li>
    <li> works great for short hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer in 2010 when my Dad&#x27;s trusty old hair dryer,which I had inherited in 2006, finally gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this hair dryer I actually read the directions and made sure never to wrap or wind the cord.  Instead, I&#x27;d drape it carefully with the hair dryer on the same shelf to avoid damage.  But, to my dismay, a few months ago my hair dryer started shorting out while I was using it.  I should also mention that I have periodically cleaned the lint from the filter using tweezers, so this is not the source of the problem.  The fact of the matter is, there&#x27;s a short in the cord and I now spend more time in the morning with my hair dryer turning on and off while I try to find just the right angle to keep the thing running.  Let&#x27;s just say that for the past few weeks in particular, my hair has been damp at best when I head out the door for work in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product - great features, reduced frizz, no problems with the placement of the switches, just the right temperature to get my hair dry - but I was hoping it&#x27;d last longer than a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Will recommend friends.</li>
    <li> It is a very good hair dryer for the money. I have seen dryers do less for more. Dry hair? This dryer will do it less time and at less money. Jfr</li>
    <li> I finally feel like I can give myself a salon-quality blow out! My hair is naturally wavy and very fine so not only does it get frizzy, it also gets staticky! I feel like the tourmaline ion technology really does remedy that. Great purchase</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It dries my hair fast, it&#x27;s quite and gets the job done... I definitely recommend this hair dryer</li>
    <li> This seems like its a good value. It does the trick. I&#x27;m glad I din&#x27;t spend any more. thank you.</li>
    <li> So far so good, definitely dries my hair faster than my older dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer really does dry the hair much faster than a regular dryer which cuts down on the damage caused to the ends of the hair.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Came when promised. The hairdryer dries my thick hair in half the time of my other hairdryers.It&#x27;s light and easy to use. I really am glad I ordered this product. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The dryer works well and is reasonably priced, but the controls are placed so that when you wrap your hand around the dryer it is practically impossible not to touch them and either get a different setting or turn the dryer off.  In my opinion, it should be back to the drawing board to design better placement of the contols.</li>
    <li> I liked how this hair dryer worked, but it was a piece of junk. After the first three months, I would have problems with it refusing to start. If I shook it around a little, it might start up again, so I think it had some loose wires.  After six months, it just died altogether. Another piece of junk from China to go to the landfill.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this dryer leaves my hair super shiny and straight in less than 15 minutes. With my old dryer it took me 30 minutes to straighten my hair. I also love that this dryer comes with a concentrator and a diffuser. I can&#x27;t believe the price -- what a deal! This dryer is highly rated in several websites and it was also recommended as a best beauty buy on the Oprah Winfrey show. So, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Very powerful and dries hair quick.</li>
    <li> Works good for a heat gun, I would imagine it will work fine as a hair dryer too. Dave.</li>
    <li> In love this blow dryer so light weight and dries fast got to have one of these!!!</li>
    <li> Works well for the price. Simple hair dryer. All you really need.</li>
    <li> really like this product</li>
    <li> Light and Effective--Great Buy!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery,Nice things,Works well.</li>
    <li> Bought in December 2014 and already in the garbage! Completely blew out! Will never buy again</li>
    <li> Love that its light. Dries hair quickly and my hair did not end up frizzy. To be honest I cant say for sure if it was the hair dryer or the new shampoo I am using. Lets say iit didnt make my hair worse by using it. I do like the attachments that came with it and since I have long hair, the weight of it really made a difference compared to other dryers ive used. Its also not that loud when on, for the price I would recommend getting it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my 10 year daughter based on the positive reviews.  However it did not dry her hair well at all.  Took way to long and feels very cheap.  In this case you get what you pay for.  I am returning it today.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It works really well, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair that usually takes 20+ minutes to dry with my old hairdryer...It was to the point it wouldn&#x27;t even completely dry before I&#x27;d have to leave so I&#x27;d just throw it in a bun. This one took around 5 minutes and my hair is completely dry..I&#x27;m very impressed and so far pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a blow dryer.. What more do you expect</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, dryer works great and she likes it very much, one slight problem...the dryer melted the plastic slit tip THAT CAME WITH THE DAMNED DRYER...it was made for this dryer and it frickin melted a 1/2inch hole on the side and after 5-6 uses melted the tip almost together....way to test the product revlon.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this dryer and the first time I used it, I fell in love with it and ordered one for myself from Amazon.  It is so easy to style my hair with it because it doesn&#x27;t blow my hair all over the place.  It&#x27;s lighter in weight and is much quieter than any other dryer I have had.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is easy to use and it does, indeed, make my hair dry faster than the last dryer I had did.  Usually, having only two temps doesn&#x27;t work for me because the warm is usually too cool, but its not on this one and even the hot isn&#x27;t too hot!</li>
    <li> I just bought the travel size version of this dryer after I dropped my second T3 travel dryer and broke it (WAY too fragile for the money they cost)and was very pleasantly surprised. My hair came out better than with my $100 T3 dryers! And this one cost me $19 on sale at Target! My hair came out much smoother, no frizz and shinier. I styled my wavy hair with a bristle round brush like usual but with this dryer it actually gave me nice, large soft waves that stayed that way all day. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product looking for something to get the job done quick with my waist length hair. I also wanted a dryer that wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair. I definately found it here! I love that this hair dryer isn&#x27;t too heavy, has a hot, warm and cool setting and is ionic.  So I don&#x27;t get damage, and it really dries my thick hair fast!  The diffuser is fabulous for when I curl my hair as well.  Overall a great product! I would definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that takes forever to dry so gave up on even using hairdryers after getting arm fatigue, frizzy, still damp,not so curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight yet powerful, using the infuser properly (I had to google it) yields the nicest curls I have ever achieved using a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I decided to give it a try!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer has caused me to grow horns.... and the devil has appeared in my bathroom in a rather unsettling turquoise robe... What was worse was his hair looked terrible too!!!</li>
    <li> The dryer worked great until the motor went out after only 2 months of use. I don&#x27;t know if others have had this problem, but very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister and it does the job. It is well built and came with an accessory right out of the box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been air drying my hair for the better part of a year and finally got sick of it. I ordered this hair dryer and I cannot believe it. Usually my thick, long hair would take half an hour or more to blow dry. This dryer gets the job done in 10 minutes. My hair has never felt so silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer based on great reviews. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t find the air flow enough to give me the body I wanted. It gets pretty hot though. Good for thinner hair but not thick hair in my opinion. Granted, I am picky, but this dryer just did not do the trick for me.</li>
    <li> The dryer did a fine job until the prongs started heating up when plugged into the outlet. The outlet prongs get so hot I can&#x27;t even touch them. If I left it on much longer it would melt my wall outlet and possibly start a fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not safe, fire hazard!!!</li>
    <li> very powerful and feels good! I like it a lot, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair at all! great price great deal</li>
    <li> Met my expectations for the price, however, doesn&#x27;t blow quite as hard as the hair dryer I used to own.</li>
    <li> I used to own a Solia hair dryer that worked great the first couple of months, but as time went on it would over heat and it eventually died out after two years. Considering how much I spent on it, I assumed it would last much longer. So having learned my lesson when it comes to hair dryers (the most expensive ones are necessarily the best ones), I wanted to make sure I made a smarter investment. Before my Solia blow dryer, I had used a Conair one and a Revlon one so I wanted to decide between the two. I had tried a brand new Conair Infinity that was 1800W and was incredibly disappointed by its power and heat capacity, so I decided to go with Revlon and chose this model based on the reviews. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but I think it has just as much power as my old Solia blow dryer for a fraction of the price. So far, its made me regret spending more than $80 on a blow dryer in the past when this one was less than $20. The real question will be longevity, but honestly at this price point, I would be happy if it lasted me a year.</li>
    <li> I love the hair dryer it very sturdy and love the attachments now all i need is a comb to attach will recommend to others!</li>
    <li> I really love this, so glad I got a new one. my old one did not work like this one.</li>
    <li> I love this. My wife dries her hair at all hours of the morning. It used to be loud, and super obnoxious. Now? It&#x27;s quiet. To boot, she dropped this thing in the toilet not long ago. It wasn&#x27;t plugged in, but she let it dry out for a week, and it works great! I love Revlon! Saved me from buying another one!</li>
    <li> I replaced my turbo-charged and so very LOUD hair dryer with this item.  I was a little skeptical with the comments of how quiet it was, but it&#x27;s TRUE!  It&#x27;s powerful without the noise.  No matter what room you were in, you could hear when the old hair dryer was being used, not with this.  I can use it in the master bathroom and not disturb my husband is the bedroom.</li>
    <li> This is a good dryer. It works well and is good value for money. We would definitely buy it again..</li>
    <li> perfect, very light and powerful! It does make my blowouts faster. And it really is less harmful for the hair.</li>
    <li> This product was much better than i hoped.  I have naturally curly hair and am unable to use a regular hairdryer, but allowing it to air dry is not always an option.  I am a HUGE fan of the Deva Curl system and my hair has never looked so good.  I cannot afford the $160 Deva Curl hair dryer that was my first choice.  I read some reviews and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one of those people that really \\&quot;knows\\&quot; how to blow dry my hair in the fancy way of salons so all I really need is something that&#x27;ll dry my hair.  I was searching for an inexpensive tourmaline ionic dryer after my, rather pricey, T3 short circuited :(.  This one definitely does the job without damaging my hair.  It&#x27;s inexpensive at a mere $20 and I can&#x27;t complain.  I do wish that the cord retracted or at least came with a velcro strap for streamlined packing when traveling.  It is a medium-size dryer.  Not at all a travel-size but not overly cumbersome that it would be a stretch to pack it. I also can&#x27;t help wishing it was a bit more powerful, but for $20 (once again) I can&#x27;t complain.  It also comes with different fixtures that I, being the hair simpleton that I am, do not use.  Always nice to have the option. The dryer also has warm/hot/cool/low/high settings.  Great for basic needs.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer reduced the time it took me greatly. However, I don&#x27;t find it as quiet as what&#x27;s advertised. Mine is still pretty loud. I love to listen to music while showering and getting ready and this drowns out the music. Worth it though since it takes less than 10 minutes to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I like it, it has nice low settings so I can dry my dog after I bathe him but it&#x27;s hard to hold the handle without accidentally pushing buttons.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Dries the hair, nice settings, but I don&#x27;t see the ionic results compared to other dryers.  For the cost its worth it, but the results are not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Works SOOO much better than my old hair dryer in that my thick, long hair dries before my arms feel like they are going to fall off.</li>
    <li> Bought this mainly for those days where I actually have the time to blow dry and straighten my hair. I have moderately curly hair (type 2C or 3A) but usually just let it air dry because it always takes too long to blow dry and straighten. This dryer with the condenser attachment and a large round brush actually made pretty easy work of a home blow out. I don&#x27;t have a lot of practice but it took about 30 min to blow dry and straighten my low back length hair (usually took about hour with my old hair dryer). The cord was plenty long and didn&#x27;t require any awkward maneuvering. I have gotten a lot of compliments on the results and most people thought I&#x27;d gone to a salon and gotten it done professionally. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the diffuser yet but would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to straighten their long curly hair at home.</li>
    <li> This is actually the best hair-dryer I&#x27;ve owned to date. I can&#x27;t believe the quality of this product compared to its price. I love it so much I&#x27;d pay for it $50.00 and over if I had to, because that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s worth to me. I have arm&#x27;s length un-processed hair. It takes me about 20-25 minutes to dry my hair with my old hair dryer, and about 30-35 minutes with styling. This little handy machine dries my hair in LITERALLY 10 minutes !!! And 15-20 minutes with styling (depends on how much I want to style my hair). Not only that: my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry and coarse. Instead, it feels smooth and silky! Like I said, I can&#x27;t believe a product of this quality being sold for ONLY $15-$20. Should it ever break, I&#x27;ll be ordering the exact same one again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you don&#x27;t have a lot of time every day to dry/style your hair. It&#x27;s also great for travelling as it&#x27;s very small and light. Love it.</li>
    <li> I started researching much more expensive hair dryers, but then I found a good review for this one so I figured Id give it a try.  So glad I did, its amazing!  Very powerful, and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
    <li> I had a $90.00 Turbo 1500 dryer that caught on fire. I owned it for about 2 1/2 yrs. I saw this dryer on Amazon and decided to try it. It dries my hair in half the time compared to the Turbo and is much lighter in weight. I love it. I read many of the reviews and noticed that some of these dryers caught on fire and the cords split. I hope Revlon fixed the problem!  But I thought that at least it was only 20 bucks that might go up in flames and not 90 bucks; keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Sturdy and lightweight. The attachments are very secure. Also, the cold setting is actually cool unlike most dyers.</li>
    <li> Do NOT purchase this dryer. It is defective. I first purchased this product in February 2011. In 2014 the cord started to short-out. While I saw negative reviews regarding that issue, my thought was &amp;#34;well, I had it for 3 years and used it everyday&amp;#34; Figured it was still a good bargain. I liked the velocity of the air flow. So in February of 2014 I purchased it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week ago, this dryer started shorting out again. If the cord was turned a particular way, it would cut out. Yesterday. It cut-out and sparks flew, there was a burning smell and that was the end of the dryer. Super unhappy with this product. Obviously, it&#x27;s a manufacturer&#x27;s issue, and this product should be pulled off the market.</li>
    <li> Works great. I use it everyday and have had no problems with it since I&#x27;ve purchased it. The extensions are neat, but I only use the smaller one for my bangs. Not quite sure how to use the bigger one.. But I don&#x27;t really care, the hair dryer is nice, easy settings: hot/warm &amp; high/low. Just your standard hair dryer, ready to use when delivered.</li>
    <li> My daughter said she loves her blow dryer, she said I should of purchase a different color. I think its a great item for her.</li>
    <li> does a great job.  quieter than the last one i had by revlon. i LOVE that i can rotate the narrow nose 360* so my wrist doesn&#x27;t have to be contorted to get the angle i need.</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> It does its job. Price is good.</li>
    <li> Beautiful high quality!! Luv em</li>
    <li> Purchased in Sept 2014. Blew up while using it -- with sparks dangerously close to my hair and face -- in April 2015.&lt;br /&gt;Shortest life of any hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Dangerous piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer definitely makes my hair lighter, bouncier, and especially shinier! Takes a bit more time to dry my hair than my older hair dryer but definitely a good product.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!! Very awesome that it has a warm setting. I have thin, hair and ends tend to split, so the warm option is great. Very powerful.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and, being from the microwave generation, do not want to spend a lot of time getting it dry.  This inexpensive Revlon hair dryer had it all - strong air flow, and hot heat.  So many other hair dryers have one or the other - being blasted by arctic air doesn&#x27;t do much to dry my hair in a quick manner, and putting out a wimpy air flow that is hot enough to melt steel doesn&#x27;t speed up the drying process as much as you&#x27;d think, either.  I was so excited when I got this dryer, as I could get my completely dry in under ten minutes (again, long and thick!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in August 2013.  I am coming to leave a review today, because this hair dryer died as spectacularly as it lived.  It spit fire at me, and then died.  RIP little dryer.  I hope your replacement is as wonderful as you were.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Lightweight, and the diffuser attachment stays put.  The one on my Conair dryer would often fall off.  This one dries my long, curly hair pretty quickly.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> i love it. it work so good</li>
    <li> I have used Revlon hair dryers for years now. I had my ancient 7yr old one die on me last summer. I purchased this as its replacement. I have 32inches of fine, straight hair and this hair dryer has damaged my hair so bad. I use heat protectant, but still... And the defuser melted a little bit when I used it. And a month ago the cord all of a sudden split and ripped. I take care of my heat tools like they are my babies, there is no explainantion as to why this hair dryer crapped out so earlier other than the fact that it&#x27;s cheap. It would make a good travel hair dryer, but definitely not an everyday tool.</li>
    <li> The lightest dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> This works really well . Having the high low and the warm hot options make s a lot of difference.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair feel smooth after drying and not rough like the last dryer I used.&lt;br /&gt;I would reocmmend this to people. For its a price its a really good buy</li>
    <li> never occurred to me that my flat, dull hair could be the result of an ancient blow dryer I&#x27;ve been using. this dries my hair in a couple of minutes, and coupled with the Conair brush it&#x27;s a match made in heaven.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers said, this worked fine until it blew up in my hand.  It didn&#x27;t burn me too badly, since fortunately I didn&#x27;t have it too close to my face at the time.  Don&#x27;t risk it.</li>
    <li> Had this with me on a trip and everyone wanted to use it because it dries so fast! Love this hairdryer!</li>
    <li> I have purchased three of these dryers in the last two years -- not because they break but because they&#x27;re so awesome! I have one for travel, one for home, and one that I bought as a replacement. My first one did conk out after almost 2 years of 3/week use. I still chose to buy another of this model rather than take a chance on a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair that reaches the middle of my back and this dryer can dry it in &amp;#62;10 minutes. My old dryer needed 20 minutes to dry my hair. I noticed that my hair is less frizzy after drying with the Revlon 1875W. It&#x27;s slightly less noisy than other dryers but not significantly. The high heat stays hot but does not burn. I try to use the low heat setting, which still dries my long hair in about 10 minutes. I have never used either attachment so can&#x27;t speak to their quality.</li>
    <li> I like the dryer for drying purposes but I wish it had the other attachments, such as the comb and brush attachments. Besides that, this dryer is perfect for dryer your hair completely.</li>
    <li> I have had this blow dryer for only 6 months and it has started sparking. I no longer feel safe using it. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Exceeded my expectations.  All of the pieces are there.  No issues at all.  Very happy and would order again.</li>
    <li> We had this hair dryer previously and it worked well for a few years before it burned out.  I never get one to last longer than a few years with everyday use.</li>
    <li> I like the dryer, I only gave it four stars because, I don&#x27;t like where the buttons are and its a little loud, so I have to use our other bathroom most days to do my hair, because I dont want it to wake my baby!</li>
    <li> My hair is about waist-length and very thick.  It generally takes me 20-30 minutes with other dryers but with this dryer, it took about 10 minutes or less for to dry my hair.  And it&#x27;s light-weight!  The diffuser is great too! It lessens the force of the blow dryer...so I guess for all those other reviewers who said this blew too hard, they didn&#x27;t use the diffuser. In any case, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone who wants to shorten their blow dryer time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 30, 2010:&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to update and say that I still have this blowdryer and still love it.  I don&#x27;t blowdry my hair often but would still highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> We used this hairdryer for over a year. Yesterday it self-ignited while using burning my hand. Others are reporting similar behavior.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer because I needed a new one. My old one got permanently lost when I moved. I was really dissappointed when I took a shower before work one morning and went to use my new hair dryer because when I plugged it in, it didn&#x27;t work. I tried clicking the reset button, but it wouldn&#x27;t reset (ie it wouldnt &amp;#34;click&amp;#34;). Luckily, Amazon is pretty great. I went into my account and asked for a replacement hairdryer. They sent me a new one (which I received a day or two later). I went to use that one and it didn&#x27;t work either (again - just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t losing my mind, I tried multiple outlets and resetting the product). I&#x27;m not sure if there is a bad batch of these or what... but both of the hair dryers I bought did not work. Now I&#x27;m waiting for a Conair one to arrive.</li>
    <li> Bought the hairdryer for my wife as a gift. She loved it. It is light weight and has all the necessary functions/setting etc. Good value for money overll</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer because the product info said it was very light.  Well it really is light and it works great.  It is a great hairdryer for the price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t afford the $200+ price tag of some of the other hair dryers, so I tried this one instead. I was surprised at how good it was in comparison. My very thick, shoulder-length hair was dry in less than 10 minutes - my former dryer took 20 - and it was smooth, shiny and sleek. Other dryers made my hair puff out like a pyramid, and lifted every split end. It&#x27;s very light. My hair with this dryer looks fantastic. I wish I had switched long ago.     Drawbacks? It&#x27;s a little loud, the switches turn off easily when you&#x27;re holding the handle, and the hot setting is really hot. But all of these things are minor complaints and worth dealing with.    So, if you don&#x27;t have $200 to spend on a hair dryer (who does?), get this one. It&#x27;s 90% as good as the top-end ones, the extra 10% better isn&#x27;t even that noticeable, and your hair will look fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick curly hair, and with all other hair dryers it takes me at least 20 minutes to get my hair mostly dry. With this dryer, it takes  about 7 minutes. I know others mentioned the noise but to me it doesn&#x27;t seem any louder than any other hair dryer. It&#x27;s light, the temperature settings are all very good, and with the diffuser, it works great.</li>
    <li> Dryer is very efficient at drying hair quickly. Hair is much more manageable than with other dryers that my wife has used.</li>
    <li> This is not a &amp;#34;luxury&amp;#34; hairdrier - it feels a bit cheap because it is cheap, and it works great. I would buy it again because I don&#x27;t have a need for a luxury hairdier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two switches and one button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switch 1: &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Switch 2: &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Button: turns the heater off while pressed, allowing you to blow cold air. There is no way to constantly blow cold air (i.e. without pressing the button)</li>
    <li> I have been using this same dryer for many years-about 5.  It finally gave out and I got another one. For the price, it is definitely the best as i had tried many others before.  This is the only one that is super lightweight and has great air flow.  If i spend $22 every 5 years, fine.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 2 months, worst hair dryer ever!</li>
    <li> It is relatively cheap and it just serves fine. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;That is all. And I think it is good.</li>
    <li> I just love the way it styles my hair and gives it volume thank you very much love my hair dryer</li>
    <li> One of my best purchases from Amazon. For the price, this hair dryer generates a airflow that well matches those professional dryer.  Quite light weight, and drop resistance. (I must have drop it from my countertop for more than 10 times, and it still work great).  It exceed all my expectation for a $20 hair dryer, and I highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a week, but I am impressed at how smooth my hair is, and how fast it dries. Much better than the blow drier I used this to replace!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought in Feb. 2011.  Good basic drier.  It just this week (Dec 2013) burnt up after a week of making a grinding sound with sparks flying and horrible smelling black smoke.  Given the cost and the fact that it is cheap Chinese junk, I think this is about par for the course.  We want everything so cheap, everything is becoming disposable.  I&#x27;m waiting for the disposable car - guaranteed to run for 3 years and falls apart.  $3000.  What do you think?  ;)</li>
    <li> Hair was up and straight in a matter of seconds, I have short hair and my hair usually sinks down after drying up but after using this it stays neatly up and straight!</li>
    <li> All I have to compare it to are cheap Walmart hair dryers, but she is happy enough with this that I am happy. Plus, for the price, can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> For some reason, I thought this was travel-sized. It&#x27;s not. (Should have read the measurements...) So, I sent it back. However, it&#x27;s a good hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, and it takes me ages to dry with most of the other hairdryers I&#x27;ve owned. I bought this one a couple years ago on the recommendation of a friend, and it has not disappointed -- it dries my hair faster than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and continued to work perfectly for more than 2 years. It recently broke (entirely my fault, I dropped it from high up onto a hard floor), and I immediately rushed to buy a new one to replace it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of this dryers. I must say I like the product. They arrived on time and so far It works great. My only complain is that the 2 additional pieces don&#x27;t fit in, &amp; believe me I took my time and tried!! Anyway, I don&#x27;t really use them that much, however if you guys do, beware!! All in all I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> This dryer has been great. It dries fast and with a lot of power and has stood up to taking a beating from me dropping it and taking it out and putting it up often.</li>
    <li> We were very happy with this dryer at first.  The price was good.  The performance was good.  Then the HIGH/LOW switch broke and now we can only dry our hair on the LOW setting.  It won&#x27;t switch to HIGH.  Very frustrating.  And of course, it was just barely past the return window for Amazon.  We are going to try to resolve the problem with Revlon directly, but what a time-consuming hassle.  AMAZON should allow a longer return window for items like this that can break down.  I will be leaning towards purchasing electronics directly from a brick and mortar store in the future.  Even Target would have allowed me to return the hair dryer after 2 months!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Worth buying!!!</li>
    <li> Would love to give zero stars. Broke within a month. Sending it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I can&#x27;t use this because it dries my hair too fast and leaves it unmanageable and frizzy. I tried it with the comb attachment and it burns cause it is too hot.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this hairdryer but like the other one star reviews, in less than a year of using it, this exploded in my hands. I was extremely lucky that I threw it from my hands immediately.</li>
    <li> This is much better than the old version Revlon hair dryer.  Haven&#x27;t figured out what is the biggest attachment used for...</li>
    <li> This dryer was as good as all the reviews said. It dries my long hair really quick.&lt;br /&gt;I would warn though that the dryer itself gets REALLY hot.  I dry my hair in sections and sometimes I set in down in my lap...it&#x27;ll burn you.</li>
    <li> I cant think of anything to complain about with this product.  Much better than my last dryer.  I like that it has speed AND temperature settings so I don&#x27;t  fry my hair.  The quality seems better than my last dryer too which was also a Revlon but cost a bit more.  I haven&#x27;t really messed with the attachments yet but am looking forward to doing so.  Another thing  I really liked was that the cord is long or at least longer than my last dryer which I appreciate.  I would bet that this dryer is as good or better than many that cost much more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been 6 months and it&#x27;s dead... This was the first blow drier I bought that only lasted 6 months... Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
    <li> I LOVE this blow dryer. I know that sounds lame but I really do. It dries speedy fast &amp; is super lightweight. I won&#x27;t give 5 stars because I&#x27;d love a retractable cord!  Update: I had to come back &amp; update my review 14 months after my purchase. The cord shorted out! Lame. Great dryer otherwise but it should have lasted longer. The product was still under warranty but you have to pay for shipping plus send $5 for return shipping....basically the cost of a new dryer. Yep. That&#x27;s not a very good warranty. Amazon refunded my $ because they are awesome like that.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it, so I&#x27;ll defer to her judgment. Apparently it makes her hair all soft. Don&#x27;t ask me how, I just bought this so she stays over more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it works quite well for that.</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt for a new dryer after I accidentally broke mine by dropping it.  I purchased this one and after using it for the first time was sorry I hadn&#x27;t purchased it a long time ago.  This blow dryer works so well!</li>
    <li> My last hairdryer burned out on me - literally caught fire and burned. I didn&#x27;t know what I wanted except that it had to be cheap and have a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came up as the best seller for hairdryers so I figured all those people couldn&#x27;t be wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really lightweight and has a few different temperature options you can easily switch between. After using a crappy one for so long I was really surprised how quickly this dried my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it only a few times but love it so far. Now as long as it doesn&#x27;t catch fire it&#x27;s a hit in my book!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is working well so far for me. I&#x27;m happy with the settings, the power and the ergonomics.</li>
    <li> Excellent article came at the indicated time. I am very happy with the item for a reasonable price. Really it is very satisfied and recommend your purchase. Really, the material and design left me happy.</li>
    <li> Cons- I was sooo excited to get this blow dryer being that it had so many good reviews. So disappointed. I have color treated blonde hair and it made it look like straw. I never use to have to straighten my hair after  I blew dry but now I have too. I didn&#x27;t have an expensive dryer before either it was just a conair $30 blow dryer and it worked a 100% better. I had high hopes for the termaline ionic ceramic but this dryer did absolutely nothing for my hair... Actually my hair looks  better letting it dry natural. When I use it I have to use it both on hot heat and high if I want it to come out at all decent. I never have had to use hot heat level On my dyers (so damaging!). Not happy. I wish I didn&#x27;t spend the $. I&#x27;m not going use this dryer ever again, it&#x27;s not worth the damage blow drying your hair causes. The hunt for a good and not super expensive dryer continues!&lt;br /&gt;Pros- it is every light weight so your hand doesn&#x27;t get tired when using it. My sister has naturally brown hair that&#x27;s isn&#x27;t color treated and her hair came out fine... She didn&#x27;t have to straighten it after.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I just bought this blow dryer, it doesn&#x27;t even work!!!! Waste of time and money, you&#x27;d be better off going to a beauty supply store to purchase one that way you can return it if you have any problems unlike this crappy website. This is the third time I bought something that didn&#x27;t work. I really upset and disappointed. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS, BETTER YET DON&#x27;T BUY ANYTHING FROM HERE!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer because of the great price. To me, a dryer is a dryer. One con is that it doesn&#x27;t take much to turn the dryer off and on so occasionally I accidentally turn it off while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> I would give this product zero stars if I could. I have had the hair dryer just over 1 year, and it has faulty wiring in the cord, so that it turns on and off as the cord moves when I dry my hair. I feel that Amazon should send me a new one- my last hair dryer lasted me several years and I would expect the same out of this one!</li>
    <li> Nice, durable blow dryer. Daily use for months with no issues, good power and heat. Good quality attachments.</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price. I do not use this frequently but when it gets hot when you need its not too loud.</li>
    <li> Pretty powerful, very functional, hasn&#x27;t yet melted into burnt plastic like my previous blow dryer. Not as powerful as the best models. About the expected size-can be hard to squeeze into some drawers, but the size is pretty standard</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good dryer! Pretty and cheap! It meets all my comment. I am soooooooo love this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> great price and product</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer! The diffuser doesn&#x27;t work as strong as the older revlon models but still pretty awesome.</li>
    <li> Blows my hair dry in like 5 minutes! Lol I was shocked with the power this thing has.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews comparing this to salon quality dryers so I decided to give it a try. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as good as the salon, but it&#x27;s a very good hair dryer (especially for that price!). I bought this a good while back (over a year I know) and use it often - still works like new. I have very thick hair and I can usually get my hair completely dry in about 10-15 mins with this!</li>
    <li> Happy wife.  Happy life.</li>
    <li> I had a Babyliss that last 9 years. Decided that I would try this one since it had amazing reviews. My last dryer was 1900 watts. I felt this one should be pretty good since it was 1875 watts. I was wrong. This one took twice as long to dry my hair. I need to return it.</li>
    <li> Good power, lightweight. Dries medium length hair fast.</li>
    <li> dries my hair quickly since ihave shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;use this product EVERY morning.&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t blow too hard compared to my friend&#x27;s blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;on low, it blows softly so i can push my hair to where i want it.. his dryer kinda was strong on the low and very strong on the high.</li>
    <li> Gentle on the hair! Make my tussles smooth and shiny ! Great value for money as well. I am happy I bought this!</li>
    <li> I could have got a better deal for the amount of money paid. still  does what says on the box.</li>
    <li> I dry my hair inffrequently, maybe couple of times a months. Bought this in may last year and it just stopped working completely. Just wont turn on. Its cheap, so I guess you  get what you pay for, but still...</li>
    <li> This dryer is a very satisfactory replacement for my 5+ year old Conair diffuser dryer.  I like it&#x27;s smaller size and sleek design.  I do notice that it doesn&#x27;t preserve my curls as well as my prior dryer.</li>
    <li> Does what I need it to do considering how much it cost</li>
    <li> Dryer had good reviews,worked well for 9 months. Have an intermittent short in the cord where it comes out of the handle.Used once a day, didn&#x27;t twist the cord, All my previous dryers lasted at least 3 or 4 years.Seems as if most things today, last much less lately.</li>
    <li> Excellent blow dryer,- I have always bought more expensive models. This dryer works great on my long thick hair - definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I recommend this hair dryer.  Who knew it was so difficult to buy a new hair dryer - the first time in 15 years.  I initially looked at the Conair but after reading many reviews decided to take this one because it has two speeds and two heat settings - 4 ways to dry, and it came with attachments.  It&#x27;s light weight too.  I&#x27;ve used it about a month and am very satisfied with it.  4 stars is a very good rating from me.</li>
    <li> I got this because I just cut my hair and went natural (I&#x27;m black for those that don&#x27;t get that; no more relaxer). So b/c it&#x27;s winter, I needed a drier that would keep my curls in tact and dry my hair quickly so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go out in the cold with a wet head. It works great and I look forward to using it as my hair grows out. Again the price is great for this product and so far its working beautifully.</li>
    <li> Be careful it can get Super super hot!!! it made my course dry hair very straight and silky hair, i love it!</li>
    <li> Heat up fast, and heats pretty well. I bought this not for hair but for some hand crafting that I need to preheat the steel. Works pretty well.</li>
    <li> This is everything my wife wanted. The dryer is good quality, has 2 speeds and temperature settings. Would recommend it</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer for its reasonable cost, good reviews and its claim to be relatively quiet.  it is not as quiet as I had hoped but works well.</li>
    <li> It has all the bells and whistles my old hair dry had.  It does the job, but the attachments, diffuser and other attachment were the same size as the end of the dryer.  I had saved my old attachments and I use them.</li>
    <li> This is a good, powerful dryer. I got this based on a consumer&#x27;s watch report on a local TV news program... basically, this unit performed better than the other two units it was up against, and the other two were professional hair dryers used by salons costing $2oo and $350. &lt;br /&gt;The unit is noisy when used on high setting, which I kind of expected because the amount of air it blows out, but it sure dries my family&#x27;s hair a lot quicker than before.</li>
    <li> I looove this dryer. It finishes the job in 1/2 the time as the old one. Yep 15 minutes. No damage either.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome.  The tools are perfect.  I use the one on the top of my hair and it dries my hair without affecting my curly hair on the sides and back.  Then I use the diffuser to dry my curly hair in the back and sides and it dries without frizzy hair.  It is a perfect fit for me!!</li>
    <li> The blow dryer does what it suppose to! It works great and I had no issue at all. Wonderful dryer.</li>
    <li> The off/ on button is so much easier to operate with one hand while the other hand dry or style the hair. Only problem i see is the wire is not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Good value for my money.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m actually reviewing a hair-dryer - I feel ridiculous doing this....but this hair dryer is horrible!  I&#x27;m sending it right back to Amazon (of course, they make this very easy).  Barely ANY air came out with the diffuser on and the blower was too strong without it.  I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s returnable.</li>
    <li> I was a doubter too about the ionic tourmaline technology but after recently getting a flat iron of that type that worked wonders, I thought I would try a dryer too. This dryer almost makes my flat iron  unnecessary. It let me blow out my fine, curly/wavy hair so smoothly it looks like I had it done at the salon -- something I achieved only with great difficulty before at home. I agree with the other reviewers it does get a little hot, but keeping it on the warm or keeping the cool shot button on helps. I think the airflow is great, because it helps straighten your hair without as much pulling. I purchased it because I read that in a test it performed as well or better than $200-$300 models, so I think it&#x27;s $30 well spent.</li>
    <li> Very slow hair dryer. My Braun was much better and three times faster. But Braun was three times more expensive :)</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is just what I needed.  I had an old one I bought for $2 at a thrift store, and this one is as good if not better than that one because...  1. It&#x27;s light.  I bought this hairdryer at Target, and they have a display that lets you hold all the hairdryers they sell to compare the weights, and this one was definitely lighter than all of the comparably equipped appliances.    2. It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive.      3. It dries my hair pretty darned fast.  I&#x27;ve got thick, curly hair and with the diffuser on warm/high, this is a dream machine.  I don&#x27;t like to blow dry my hair after showers, but using the cold air button is handy &#x27;cause it gets rid of the excessive dampness without burning my hair to nothing.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine however when you pay good money for something, you expect it to be complete.  I received the hair dryer today and I was missing the Concentrator attachment.  I am not sending it back over an accessory; but my decsion for this particular dryer was partially based on cost, the product itself, and accessories.  So thus no fourth star for missing concentrator.</li>
    <li> *UPDATED REVIEW* I would not recommend buying this hair dryer. I had used it over for over a year with no issues and I loved it because it dried my hair so quickly. BUT a couple days ago I was drying my hair, had been using the hair dryer for about 2 minutes, when all of the sudden sparks started shooting out of the handle of the dryer (where I was holding it) and I dropped it on the floor and quickly unplugged it. There didn&#x27;t appear to be a fire, but I was freaked out and immediately threw it in the garbage can. I just went back to read other 1 star reviews and see that other people have had the same issue, so I&#x27;m wondering if there was a recall for this product that we all aren&#x27;t aware of.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this blow dryer. I think it is nearly the same as the salon dryers that cost much much more. It is lightweight and dries my very thick quickly as compared to any other dryer I have owned. I like that it has both types of attachments and I use them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet, so 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Bought two, first one lasted 1 year and 11 months.  Good enough.  Second one lasted less than 4 months.  OK, its 20 bucks.  But Really!!! And forget about trying to return it for a warranty.  You are dealing with Revlon.</li>
    <li> this is the third Revlon dryer I have purchased from Amazon, and I am still a big fan. I dont understand why people spend so much money on hairdryers, when the Revlon dryers have all the necessary components at a very reasonable price.  They are lightweight, have the quick drying ionic aspect, dont burn your hair, and dont shut off all the time like some dryers do as they overheat often.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was very inexpensive, yet it delivers on the promise of drying your hair quickly.  My only complaint is that with longer hair, it gets caught in the intake more frequently than with other dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I finish my hair now in about half the time. it also came within 24 HOURS which is incrediable. it gets nice and hot or nice and cool, it&#x27;s fast and easy and looks really nice. SUCH A GREAT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT ONE REGRET</li>
    <li> I bought this elsewhere around  July 2013.  In October  2013 it started glowing  like flames inside and within a few minutes stopped producing heat,  just blows cold air now.</li>
    <li> This product is lightweight making it perfect for traveling. The diffuser and the concentrator are helpful. The heat is effective.</li>
    <li> IT DOES NOT GET HOT ENOUGH AND IT TAKES TO LONG TO DRY MY HAIR.  I GUESS IF YOU HAVE THIN HAIR THIS IS THE PERFECT DRYER.  I HAVE VERY THICK HAIR AND THIS WAS NOT THE DRYER FOR ME.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light weight, works well, and was reasonably priced. My niece said it even has a cool air setting....I don&#x27;t know if this is something unusual, but heh, she likes it.</li>
    <li> Super quiet! I have medium-fine hair, but I do have a lot of it.  It used to take me about 20 minutes to dry my hair.  With this it takes about 5-8 minutes. AND it&#x27;s really quiet.  So quiet I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be effective.  It was a great buy.</li>
    <li> This is an extremely nice blow dryer without breaking the bank to purchase it.  I especially like the diffuser it came with.</li>
    <li> This dryer itself works fine; not too heavy, good power.  The problem arrises when you try to remove an attachment.  Since it is held on by falling into a groove on the head of the dryer, the only way to remove it is to is to&amp;#34;muscle it off&amp;#34;, as my husband explained.  He has the hang of it now.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Really liked how it comes with the addons. Quieter than most hair dryers, but it is still loud.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your prompt service on this Revlon blow dryer that I purchased. I love it and the attachments that came with it!!</li>
    <li> The blow dryer is durable and handles very well.  Great purchase for the price.  The diffuser itself is wonderful and very handy.</li>
    <li> Really like this hairdryer.  It has 2 heat settings and a cold air button to help set hair after drying.  I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> After seeing that this dyer had 500+ positive reviews and it was so affordable, I decided to buy it without hesitation. I am not disappointed at ALL! I have natural curly hair so I needed a dryer that did not fry my hair, this was exactly what I was looking for, is light, can get very hot and it dries my hair extremely fast!</li>
    <li> I love this purchase!! This hairdryer dries my hair really quickly!! I have a very full head of latino hair (dark, strong and very curly), and I usually blow dry and then Iron it. This blower dries my hair fast, in under 20 minutes my hair is completely dry. Also, it leaves it feeling extremely soft, with lots of shine. I no longer feel the &amp;#34;rough, cooked-hair&amp;#34; feel that normal hairdryers leave your hair with (Im guessing thats the ion and tourmaline technology doing its job). I would definitely buy again, its a bargain for the price!!!</li>
    <li> I would have given it five stars except the blower fan quit working four days after the thirty day warranty period expired.</li>
    <li> not sure about the ionic stuff.... but was/is great upgrade from my 10 plus year old hair dryer</li>
    <li> the package came open and the item has some scratches, but it is working ok</li>
    <li> It does what it should. We have had it a year. I came one day and my wife said that it stopped working.  I plugged it in hit the GFI reset and it worked. Didn&#x27;t think anything of it.  The next day she said she went to use it and it would not work. She tried another plug.  Nothing.  She jiggled the cord, it started to work intermittently and then a pop and flames out the back.  She unplugged it and the flames subsided.  I realized these don&#x27;t last forever but we have had it a year and no problems with it until then.  It is always kept unplugged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will be trying another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> My wife love this item and use it every day. A great item!</li>
    <li> Light weight and perfect for my hair!  I have a ton of hair and it is quite long at the moment.  It generally takes me quite some time to dry my hair, and the weight of the hairdryer can be annoying at times - but not with this one!  Seems lighter.  And it seems to dry my hair quicker.  Happy I purchased this!</li>
    <li> Bought this blower dryer for my wife and it worked great for about 12 months, than it blew up in her hand.  I was actually standing there while she was blow drying her hair and saw it happen.  She said most blow dryers she&#x27;s had last 2+ years.  Scary stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 10+ year old Conair dryer.  It has plenty of oomph and dries my hair in half the time my old one did (likely because of the increase in max wattage to 1875w).  It is light, easy to hold, and powerful.  The warm setting isn&#x27;t too hot to use on my kids either, which I was concerned about.  It&#x27;s not a fancy drier, but it works well.  I would purchase it again, especially given the low price.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do. It is very light weight which is super helpful. I like the many temperature options. I can even set it on the medium heat or cold shot to dry my toddlers nails. I like that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this dryer with the diffuser since I never heat-straighten my hair. I have 3c/4a hair, it&#x27;s about bra-strap length when stretched.  Overall, I don&#x27;t feel like this dryer fits my needs and will probably return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I do like how light and small the dryer is, especially for a tourmaline ionic ceramic dryer. It&#x27;s also inexpensive for a name brand dryer, especially if you have, like I do, a Prime membership. The diffuser is larger than others I&#x27;ve used so it really preserved my curls with minimal frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: as other reviewers mention, the placement of the buttons is *very* distracting and it&#x27;s difficult to not accidentally turn it off or change the heat settings. The main reason it doesn&#x27;t work is that, with the diffuser, the air is too cool on hot setting. Frankly, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference between hot and warm settings. In about 30 minutes, I was only able to get about 80% of my hair dry (and it hadn&#x27;t been sopping wet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...can this dryer handle my curls? That&#x27;ll be a no. On to try another!</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair that, without a dryer, can take upwards of 4 hours to dry. This hairdryer is the answer. It leaves my hair frizz free, the diffuser dries quickly and evenly. I can usually get my hair totally dry (on high heat, low speed) in 20 minutes or so. The weight is good too, not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why three stars then? Well, I had my dryer for a year and it broke. The cord base shot out a spark and small flame and the dryer was shot. Keep in mind I was always gentle with the cord (not wrapping it around and around). I know this is a cheap dryer, but honestly, it seems ridiculous to buy a dryer and only expect to get a year&#x27;s use out of it. It&#x27;s wasteful that my 1 year old dryer is now in a dump somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good dryer, and if it were double, even triple the cost, and was better built, I&#x27;d be so happy. There&#x27;s no reason this couldn&#x27;t be a more sturdy product.</li>
    <li> This product started to spark at the wall outlet within the third or fourth use. It&#x27;s completely unusable now. I&#x27;d think twice before buying this.</li>
    <li> Best blow drier I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I have a LOT of hair and rather thick hair and this really gets the job done quickly (even when I set it at cool) without drying my hair out.</li>
    <li> Best value for the money.</li>
    <li> Its little bigger then I expected. Option of having just a blower without heat is really good. Like it really.</li>
    <li> works very well to blow dry my hair</li>
    <li> Wonderful it leaves my hair smooth</li>
    <li> We love it!  I&#x27;m able to get curls in my long straight hair, and works great for styling my mom&#x27;s silver hair.&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight too.</li>
    <li> A very good product. Wife using it daily . Works well.</li>
    <li> very fast drying hair dryer, quieter than other styles I have used</li>
    <li> This was the best hair dryer I ever owned, until it started sparking where the cord met the motor/drying unit. Despite having loved it while it worked, this is too dangerous, and I&#x27;ll never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Eh.  Not very powerful, the highest setting is not what I hoped for.  I like that it is lightweight and the on and off is easy to use.  Smaller so easy to store.</li>
    <li> The worst dryer I have ever bought. Cuts off within 30 seconds use--and the vents are NOT blocked. Takes hours for it to start again. Does not live up to the &amp;#34;speed dry&amp;#34; claim. My old dryer did a faster job. Over all a very poor performer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has everything I need to do curly styling and straight styles. Great rice.</li>
    <li> A hair dryer was always just a hair dryer before.  But this dryer does a great job.  I have highlighted hair so my hair can look dry sometimes.  This helped dry it fast yet not add more stress to it.  Granted it uses heat but not as intense as other hair dryers I have used. My hair is a wavy medium texture and this works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> This is my second Revlon hairdryer in this model. Great for thick hair. I have long and thick hair and this dryer dries it very fast. It is light and I love how fast it dries! Make sure you clean the vent in the back often, the back opens easily and all you have to do is take the dust bunnies out of the fan and you are good to go! Great hair dryer and the price is even better!</li>
    <li> I advise to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;Durable product at low price!!&lt;br /&gt;Two adapters came with the product best works for the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use!</li>
    <li> Versatile, quick and the straightest hair I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s awesome.  I like it so much. it is cheap and works well for this price. DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY IT</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon in March 2013. I loved this hair dryer as it was very powerful and cut down on frizz when I would straighten my fine, color-treated hair.  I am only giving it 2 stars because it is now September 2013 and it won&#x27;t work at all anymore. I kept the vents clean and made sure no hair or fuzz would catch in the intake vents.  I realize that it is not a high price/ professional dryer, but I would expect it to work for at least one year, not just 5 months!</li>
    <li> its a good dryer but little bigger than expected. haven&#x27;t used it yet as plug is different. Once I get the converter then I can use it.</li>
    <li> Very good drier.  Dries my hair faster than most, or maybe it&#x27;s because&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the part that concentrates the air.  Whatever it is, I am pleased with it and would recommend it especially if you like to style dry.</li>
    <li> I had this dryer for 5 months &amp; it worked great. Then one day it just stopped. It didn&#x27;t smoke or spark &amp; it wasn&#x27;t my wall outlet or the reset button. I&#x27;ll never buy another Revlon hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Works great. I use this everyday and it works as well or better than one&#x27;s double the price. Love this thing.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer.  It has good functions available.  It isn&#x27;t heavy or awkward.  I&#x27;m a little scared about some of the reviews that mention the cord sparking.  I haven&#x27;t seen that yet, but imagine that you can avoid that by not tightly wrapping the cord around it when you store it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was billed as a, &amp;#34;quiet hairdryer&amp;#34; but to me it isn&#x27;t any quieter than any other modern day model.</li>
    <li> The heat and cool air is wonderful, I like the cold blast button. There&#x27;s an indicator light for the ions working like they should. It&#x27;s attractive in color and style, as far as blow dryers are concerned. It comes with a point attachment and a diffuser. It has three temperatures and the cold blast. The air flow is sufficient, and the heat is not too hot so it burns but hot enough it dries quickly. I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less frizz in my curly hair and my best friend borrowed it and she has super fine straight hair and had it blow dry smooth without any static when she borrowed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had but one complaint, and it&#x27;s really a minor one: the product &#x27;feels&#x27; cheap. i worry a little bit that it&#x27;s not going to be sturdy over the long haul if I drop it or knock it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I like how it looks, it&#x27;s light enough it&#x27;s easy to hold, and I like how it works. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it, but I also recommend treating it carefully, because it does look like it won&#x27;t take a beating very well. if you travel a lot of are hard on appliances like this, you might want to find one a bit &#x27;sturdier&#x27; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with how it does your hair and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews and I chose this because of its simplicity and its easy to use! I mean how much do you have to spend on a hair dryer to hang in a closet! Its not a fashion statement its what you do with your hair! Powerful enough for highest level of detail and light enough for me. UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY YOUR NOT GONNA MISS! BUY THIS ONE!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews of this item, I placed my order and truly like the fact that it does not take a long time to dry my curly/wavy hair!  I would definitely recommend this product if you are in a hurry!</li>
    <li> I like it.  It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use and the controls are easy to understand.  I&#x27;m not sure about the attachments yet, but will try them out next time I use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair dryer about 10 times so far and I have to say.  It is an amazing bang for your buck!  I mainly got it as a back up dryer and then began my search for a high quality dryer in the $80-$100 price range.  I tried Solia 1875 ionic and the Rusk Speed Freak so far and both of them paled in comparison to this one.  It only has two heat settings but the high heat is perfect (not too hot, but not warm either).  This dryer is tourmaline &amp; ceramic and I found i had more body and the same amount of shine with this one as I did with the Solia but the Solia made my hair very flat.  Not so with this dryer.  My hair has great body and doesn&#x27;t get stringy or greasy the next day.  THe Rusk dried my hair to shreds (can you say horse hair???) and caused a lot of breakage.  I am sending both the high priced dryers back whence they came and keeping this one and will buy a 2nd one as a backup and I still saved about 50%!  Thanks Revlon &amp; Thanks Amazon!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I still like this product but it didn&#x27;t really calm my damaged broken bangs.  It left them frizzy and I think was contributing to the damage.  Every time I dried my hair my broken bangs would fly all over the place and stick up horribly.  I ended up buying a Babyliss 6600 dryer from Amazon and will use this as a backup.  It is very lightweight but I dont think it will hold up well.  Stick to Babyliss (more money but worth it if you have damaged, fragile hair).</li>
    <li> Great dryer for the price!  Diffuser included work well with curly hair. Will buy another one for my gym bag!</li>
    <li> This product has absolutely met my expectations. It is lighter, quieter, and much more efficient than the model I had previously been using. I have even seen an improvement in the health of my hair. Very good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Drys store fast, love the diffuser. It works. Idk about the ion technology because it&#x27;s like any other blow dryer to me as far as the connection of your hair afterwards. I use oil on my hair so my hands get a little oilly and after the 1st use the writing on the buttons rubbed off.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer after reading a variety of great online reviews.  I am happy with the purchase as it drys my long hair fairly quickly.  The only things I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is loud and doesn&#x27;t fold up.  The price was the best on Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> This makes my thick straight hair really fluffy and dry looking.  Think Farrah Fawcett feathered hair.  I&#x27;ve tried not drying it all the way, drying it more, using lots of shine product afterward, changing shampoo and conditioner, etc.  It takes about 2 days of not washing my hair before it looks healthy again.  This dryer would have been fantastic for me in the 1970s!  Although I doubt it would hold a feathered look as it doesn&#x27;t help me achieve any style I try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight, cord length is okay, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.  Just doesn&#x27;t work with my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it. It works for my curly hair. Also great for starters .good thing I found this product while it lasted</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she said its so much better than what she had.  Good purchase and price.</li>
    <li> I found this dryer to be lightweigt and very quick drying even when using the diffuser.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel too much difference between this dryer and others, but I don&#x27;t feel anything bad with it. It is a little heavey, but acceptable.  I give 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair and it takes a big cbunk of my time every morning to blow it dry.  This hair dryer cut my drying time by approx. 40% - it&#x27;s amazing.  And the price is fantastic compared to other tourmaline dryers I&#x27;ve looked at.  ($200 or $300 for a hair dryer?  You&#x27;ve got to be kidding me!!) I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have owned two of this brand/model. The first one lasted 2-3 years. The second one, purchased from amazon, lasted 1 yr (and 5 days...exactly). I use it 4-5 days per week. Each one I owned died in the same way. All of a sudden they started making a terrible grinding sound. It sounded like an electric saw. My husband figured out it was the fan grinding against the sides of the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it worked just fine. I have thin, wavy medium-length hair. Took 20 min or so to blow dry sections with a round brush. It&#x27;s not too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not buy again just because it broke in one year&#x27;s time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but not excellent.  It&#x27;s fairly lightweight, moderately loud.  I don&#x27;t notice anything special about the &#x27;ionic&#x27; thing.  Controls are easy to use.  I really don&#x27;t like the diffuser. The &#x27;fingers&#x27; are very rigid and the whole dryer just skids over your head. I have a more contoured pliable diffuser from an old dryer that I use instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better dryers out there, but for the reasonable price, this is probably as good as you are going to do.  Air flow is better than on most inexpensive dryers and it throws a fair amount of heat.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this dryer: she says it works great on her long hair ... and at the price, how can you go wrong? It&#x27;s a top pick at Consumer Reports, and I can see why:  great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> The only down side is the fan in the back. I have long hair and it sucks it in and knots it up. Be careful. Otherwise, its great. I love how the attachments click on, so you know they won&#x27;t fall off during use.</li>
    <li> A returning guest was impressed with this hair dryer. I have never used it laid eyes on it. But thought it was a strange thing to comment on so it must be nice!!!</li>
    <li> Very good as described. Low noise, powerful and very light. I am very happy with it. It was for sure a good deal.</li>
    <li> Works as well as any other hair dryer.  I&#x27;m a bit confused as to why it has a power indicator light.  If it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s blowing air and loud.  The light doesn&#x27;t really add much.</li>
    <li> I bought for my mom and it works perfect. It is super light and  has an enormous potency.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer is okay. I much more prefer my 2-speed Revlon with 3-heat settings and an ionizer. This makes my hair frizzy. The pluses are that it&#x27;s not big and is rather lightweight. Cons are there are only two speeds and heat settings and it leaves your hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> The shipping on this item was pretty slow.  It took approximately 2 weeks for delivery.  I expected it take about 5-7 days.  I like the dryer.  It is a little bit lighter than my other Revlon Ionic dryer which is nice.  It also gets hotter than my previous dryer which I also like.  Overall I like the dryer.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this dryer for five years and I&#x27;ve still never once considered replacing it!  Despite the fact that it has been dropped more times than I can count and taken a myriad of other forms of abuse, it still works as well as it did the day I got it.  It dries my long thick hair very quickly, without heating up to be uncomfortable.  It&#x27;s light and easy to maneuver, and the button placement is perfect.</li>
    <li> the attachments for this product were the best, I really enjoy the high speed to dry hair faster again attachments work great</li>
    <li> I’m always in search of a hair dryer that can blow dry my thick, curly hair as well as my stylist does. (I know … I know … it’s the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it … I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review compares the Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer,).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them have:&lt;br /&gt;  * Same wattage&lt;br /&gt;  * Three heat settings&lt;br /&gt;  * Two speed settings&lt;br /&gt;  * Cool shot feature&lt;br /&gt;  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments&lt;br /&gt;  * Ionic technology&lt;br /&gt;  * Ceramic technology&lt;br /&gt;  * Hanging loop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn’t say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon’s concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington’s fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It&#x27;s hot to put it back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say “may” because the difference wasn’t large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it’s the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That’s the whole point of going curly – not having to do any hair drying. As for noise – I can’t answer which one is quietest because I’m deaf. It’s not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn’t perform as well as the DC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 29 Nov 2016: This is the second hairdryer as the first one lasted only eight months. The company replaced it. And now the second one died within two years. (Warranty is 24 months.) Time to find another brand.henever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally.

    <li> I have had two of these dryers. While the price is great, and the dryer itself works well, they eventually failed where the cord attaches to the handle. First the dryer stopped working intermittently while in use, because the cord bent a certain way.  I had to hold the cord while drying to keep the dryer working. After several months of this, the cord started shooting sparks where it attaches to the handle. At that point, I unplugged and got rid of the dryer.  This happened with both of my Revlon dryers.  I did not wrap the cords tightly around the dryer handle to store, so I think this is a faulty design and a major weakness.  I would say each dryer lasted maybe 3-4 years.  Again, a good price for the amount of years, but I don&#x27;t like when sparks fly from my hair dryer.</li>
    <li> There are so many hair dryers out there, and I have pretty basic hair (dries straight even without a dryer) so I really just needed a basic one for nights when I didn&#x27;t want to go out with a wet head and wait for my hair to dry.  this does the trick and have had for about a month with no issues.  may not be super powerful for someone with thicker/harder to manage hair, but I cant really say...</li>
    <li> good product works like it is supposted to work I have not had any problems with it its a hair dryer</li>
    <li> worthy the price, got 3 levels, strong wind that can make my hair easily dry. Also a good dryer for blow out</li>
    <li> It is a surprisingly difficult task to find a hair dryer that has the ability to blow strong, with enough heat and NOT have an annoying pitch in the sound. This almost did the trick. But alas took too long to dry my short but very thick hair. This became my new back up dryer, waiting in the wings of the bathroom cabinet should my favorite dryer fail me. My favorite? Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer. I purchased this to replace my old Remington that was tried and true for over 10 years. I should have known better than to try and save 10 bucks and buy this Revlon RV544PKF 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer . Oh well it&#x27;s not a bad dryer, just not as powerful as I need.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is gentle on my hair, the low temperature is a perfect setting, and variable speed setting is great.</li>
    <li> This is the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  It dries my hair quickly without drying it out.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer!  I have thick hair &amp; it makes the job quick and easy!  My hair look shinny when I am finished which is awesome!</li>
    <li> Best dryer I&#x27;ve ever had! Pulls my hair sometimes but it&#x27;s rare.</li>
    <li> This Revlon hair dryer has been blowing peoples heads with its style and attachment. It will leave you saying wow it must be Revlon. You get salon performance in this Revlon hair dryer . Help shape that hair style from a hair dont to a hair do . Let Revlon blow your head today and be Revlon beautiful.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My hair was so much more manageable.  No more frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Linda Harrison</li>
    <li> This one reaced the one k lost in the Memorial Day flood!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I wore out my original one of these and purposely ordered the same as a replacement.  It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to handle, folds easily for traveling, and get the overall job done!</li>
    <li> I always read the reviews before buying a product. I like seeing what people thought were the specific pros and cons. The ratings were great for the important features, and the ones who wrote cons were just silly. &amp;#34;Only lasted a couple years&amp;#34;... yea, that&#x27;s about right for a hairdryer that you use daily. &amp;#34;The cord tangles up&amp;#34;... so does my cell phone charger and vacuum cord. &amp;#34;Gets too hot&amp;#34;... don&#x27;t hold it in one spot for an extended period of time (or maybe try one of the other three settings?) For $20, I think it is a steal!!</li>
    <li> Good, efficient, attractive and easy to hold. Not heavy and dries my very wavy thick hair completely in seconds literally. My hair length is much below my shoulder blades and this hair dryer really does it for me. It has 2 speeds and very flexible. What can I say? Like every other amazon product so far this is also great. Love it.</li>
    <li> easy to use works great!</li>
    <li> Fairly light weight. Much whiter than regular blowdryer. Drys thinks hair well. Had another one of these for 5 1/2 years. Longest one has ever lasted for me because I have thick hair and dry it everyday.</li>
    <li> Purchased this hair dryer in January and I liked it until it died yesterday for no apparent reason. I know it wasn&#x27;t expensive, but I think it should last more than 5 months.  I will be contacting the company for a refund.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself three years ago, then when my mother&#x27;s broke last year, I got the same one for her for Christmas. She loves it. It&#x27;s quiet, doesn&#x27;t have cumbersome settings (just hi-low-off, and hot-warm, with a cool shot button), and is relatively lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that the diffuser attachment is very difficult to get on. But since she and I both have crazy coarse hair and would never use any blow-dryer without the diffuser, this is a one-time problem.&lt;br /&gt;I love this blow-dryer. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that holds moisture like crazy, and this dryer cut my drying time drastically. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the material that the dryer is made of, but I think that for the price it is a great buy. And the additional styling attachments work great also.</li>
    <li> It works very good for the price I love it. I recommended to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spent a fortune on a basic hair dryer. it does what is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and this dries my hair very quickly. It also leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth. And it&#x27;s very light.</li>
    <li> i had to stop using this today after about a year of moderate use (a few times a week, not daily) because it started to spark and smell like smoke! i&#x27;ll be reporting this to amazon. i&#x27;m highly disappointed. glad i didn&#x27;t get rid of my old hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for four months and one day stopped blowing hot air. Super disappointing.</li>
    <li> This dryer is average, doesnt dry any quicker than my very old standard one. It is lite in weight. Arrived quickly. (I have very thick long hair, dry time is the same)</li>
    <li> Loved this dryer but it died after about a year. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m willing to buy another one.</li>
    <li> My old hair dryer was an 1850 watt.  It was so loud that my ears would ring after using it.  I finally decided I was damaging my ears and there must be something quieter out there.  My other hair dryer had a high whining noise (almost like a leaf blower) this doesn&#x27;t have that high pitch sound.  It has a much lower tone, and it seem like more volume of air.  Very happy with the noise level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it dries hair fast!  I do have fine thin shoulder length hair, so it didn&#x27;t take too long prior to dry, but I have cut my time in 1/2.  It probably takes 2 minutes to dry my hair.  So now I have two minutes extra every day and will not looe my hearing.  I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer. Extremely happy. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> it doesnt get hot enough for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fond of it, what else can I say? And it straightens hair pretty well for just being a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is a steal! For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. I have curly hair, so I rely on all types of hair products and instruments to keep my hair stylish and healthy. It&#x27;s not fancy, but it does the job and well! I appreciate both attachments as they help my achieve either a nice, sleek straighter style or a bouncy, perfected finish for my curly locks.</li>
    <li> Husband bought this blow dryer for me and I love it . Has the latest drying technology and is simple to use</li>
    <li> exactly as described, works better than others costing much more, not heavy or overly loud.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I love love love his dryer. its quiet, not heavy at all, the highest setting is really hot but I like that even when I know its not good for my scalp. It lasted me only a year, it kind of burnt while I was using it. I bought another one instead buy keep missing this one. The nozzle and the diffuser stay in place ALWAYS, which now I know, its not very common with hair dryers, specially the cheap ones, (im using a Remmington right now and its a pain in the /&amp;$ to keep it attached.</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  Leaves my hair soft and manageable, no frizz.  I didn&#x27;t know there was such a huge difference with the tourmaline ceramic dryers, .</li>
    <li> My wife loves her new dryer.  The flow is great and the settings let you get the temp just right.  Her hair drying time is half what is was.  Hair length is 4 inches below her shoulders when curled.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never in my life spent more than $30 on a hairdryer. With this in mind, this hairdryer is doing an admirable job drying my hair within a reasonable amount of time and maintaining the balance between &#x27;no heat&#x27; and &#x27;scalp scalder.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer, I needed one with a diffuser as I have frizzy hair. The diffuser works great. So glad I can blow dry my hair without looking like i stuck my finger in a socket! Totally recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> We bought two of this exact dryer so far, one in Nov. 2012, one in Jan. 2014. The second one just died. So the designed lifetime is apparently about 14 months. This is with light usage by a single person with less than shoulder long hair. We will not by this one again, $20 for a year of hair drying can sure be beaten... Also, it dies pretty spectacularly, with sparks flying out. Lucky that no one got hurt. When examining the second one (I am an electrical engineer), we also discovered that one of the cores in the power cable was 98% broken - outright dangerous.</li>
    <li> I was given a gift of the hair drier. I liked it so much I bought my wife one when hers kicked the bucket.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer!  Your hair is dry in almost no time. Just wish they would invent a silent dryer!</li>
    <li> I have never had a wire malfunction like I have on this hair dryer...flames and sparks jumped out and burned my wife&#x27;s arm while using it.  The cord melted/burned near where it connects to the actual dryer.</li>
    <li> great price and does the job</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer for the price!!!</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. The high function gets really hot and I&#x27;ve slightly burned myself (nothing more than you touching the stove for instance. ) when I touched the end of it a few times. I have short hair and it&#x27;s not thick I just have finr hair and a lit of it and it dries pretty Quickly like 5-9 minutes. Would buy again</li>
    <li> Great for about 41/2 years then it sparked and the cord split open. Very similar to other complaints. Not buying another one to replace it. I am not a daily user only once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> Have had this for a year now and still working great. Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Works well and I like that they have attachments! It&#x27;s very reliable and I like to take it with me when I travel since this dries my hair so much faster than hotel ones (and I have long hair). So great that my room mate also has one!</li>
    <li> Had to replace my dryer I&#x27;ve had for the past 10+ years. This has been great! Dries my hair fast and the high setting blows just hard enough. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Fabulous ..... fabulous.... i dont link i need to say more... do i ....i should... well since i have lots of space for more characters . &amp;#34;ahem&amp;#34; BEST BLOW DRYER EVER. Its light weight, travel safe, shipping was good, it definitely speeds up styling time 3 maybe not 3. 10X less than before and awesome for deep conditioning when used with my soft hood attachment also a fabulous buy. Only con ..... i would give it 11 stars but amazon on allows 5 max for every item on their site ... Bummer ;P</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer 6 months ago and like a few other people have mentioned here, sparks started to fly out of it! Pretty scary it almost caused a fire.</li>
    <li> Nothing special but works well... its been years since i bought it and I&#x27;m writing a review now. Still works.... if I had to buy one now I would buy a salon professional that stuff is amazing you just hold it up and it straightens your hair no need to do extra effort like you do with these cheap kind of blow driers.</li>
    <li> This dryer works great on my long, thick hair. It has a powerful airflow and is reasonably lightweight.  This works better than my ridiculously expensive t3 dryer. The price is perfect. Getting a second one to keep in our guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that I use the concentrator attachment regularly and the attachment snaps on really loosely, so the concentrator (the attachment that you use to narrow the heat concentration) rotates and changes angle multiple times when I&#x27;m trying to blow my hair dry. It&#x27;s pretty annoying, but I&#x27;m learning to deal with it. Overall, it was really cost effective and it&#x27;s small so it will be good for traveling, and it&#x27;s pretty powerful too.</li>
    <li> This is a dryer that is both quiet and efficient. The attachments help with this efficiency, promoting healthy, attractive hair styles.</li>
    <li> Cord shorted out at the handle today, 5 days short of a year, only two people using it daily in a single location.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for a couple of years.  Today, while I was drying my hair, sparks flew out of it.  I immediately unplugged it.  I checked on the internet and found that this has happened to a lot of people with this same dryer.  Some people were badly burned.  I threw mine out.  Annie</li>
    <li> I like how there&#x27;s an option to choose hot and warm air flow.</li>
    <li> Revised comment--bought in May, now has lost power and has burning smell.  Considering I didn&#x27;t use this daily, it is really a piece of junk..!  The following is my orig comment when I first used it:  This replaced an old dryer that was starting to overheat after years of service.  Maybe I&#x27;ve forgotten how strong dryers are supposed to be, but this one has a powerful air flow, and even the low setting is warm enough for finishing the job.  Took off one star because the button placement is a bit inconvenient..I tend to hit them when I change hand grips, but overall, it&#x27;s been a great buy.</li>
    <li> This USED to be my favorite blow dryer of all time. I have used it for years and was always happy to replace it as long as it lasted at least a year. The last three I have ordered have died within 3-4 months. Sparks flew out of the first one. I assumed it was a fluke. The second and third would only work if you shook them and even then, they would only last for a minute or two before finally dying. I am VERY disappointed and won&#x27;t give this dryer another chance. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Is not like I have lot of hair to dry, I&#x27;m almost bold but this hair drier is working very good</li>
    <li> I only had this dryer one year and it started to stop and start.  It did this for 2 days and then a huge spark came out of the dryer.....scared the heck out of me.  It could have burned me or started a fire.  Apparently I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s past the 30 day return policy.  Beware......I read other reviews of the same thing happening.  DO NOT ORDER!!</li>
    <li> My old dryer was shot, this one is much lighter and it gets the job done nicely, feels like &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; air also if that makes any sense. I would recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a good price on a dryer.</li>
    <li> Heats easily and is very lightweight. I often get up early to dry my hair and sometimes my husband is still sleeping during that time. My old blower always wakes him up but this one is much more quiet than that one.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is far better than models I have used that cost over $150.  Its no loud, no heavy, and just simply does the job.  Dries my hair much faster than others and assists in leaving it silky and soft</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying when I opened the box, I was less than impressed with the dryer. It doesn&#x27;t look like the higher end blow dryers and looks pretty cheap. However, this is why you shouldn&#x27;t judge a book by its cover. It&#x27;s a great dryer. It has definitely cut my drying time down by probably about one half the time. I&#x27;ve read others have said it&#x27;s quieter than most dryers but I haven&#x27;t noticed that. It is lightweight which is nice. I can tell it&#x27;s ionic and my hair is shiny and less frizzy. That being said you can&#x27;t turn the ions off and although it hadn&#x27;t happened to me yet, I have noticed sometimes ionic dryers make my hair flat.  I gave it four stars because I am concerned about its longevity; it just doesn&#x27;t feel super solidly made and not being subjected to turn off the ions.  Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with the dryer and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This dryer was so reasonable that I found it hard to believe the reviews about how amazing it is.  They were right.  There are different levels of heating and drying power that are terrific.  The attachment makes it a breeze to use.  I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is being blown all around.  Looking forward to using the diffuser.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This a great hair dryer. Nice airflow and settings. I&#x27;d been using my girlfriend&#x27;s for years and this is definitely a bit nicer. I have a giant thick afro and this does work on it in just a few minutes. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Attachments are a nice addition.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer in December 2012. For a while it worked great but about 10 months later it started acting up and while drying my hair, if I had the dryer positioned a certain way the motor would turn off. All I had to do was reposition and it would start up again so I didn&#x27;t think much of it....Until late February 2014 when it blew completely. The dryer sparked and a puff of smoke came out leaving an odor that something had just burned. NOT SAFE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally thought it was a good buy. And for the price I didn&#x27;t expect it to last forever, but I thought I&#x27;d get more than 14 months out of it...and certainly didn&#x27;t expect sparks!</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer and it is really fantastic. :)</li>
    <li> This is so far the best fan i owned. It does it&#x27;s job and it&#x27;s perfect size for an everyday use.</li>
    <li> this is a well balanced product with plenty of features.  the volume of air this moves makes hair drying quick.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my hair dryer. It works wonderfully and dries my hair quickly. It does what it&#x27;s made to do. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a month ago and it works really good It gets the job done and its inexpensive</li>
    <li> Light weight but powerful, the perfect hair dryer at a very reasonable price. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This dries my hair in half the time of my old dryer and leaves it soft and silky smooth! Buy this!</li>
    <li> very good for my natural curly hair, u can use it with the brush for strait hair result or for rolling it</li>
    <li> For the price, this dryer is great.  Light as a feather and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Handles the job very well, the attachments are a plus - my previous dryers had no attachments, definitely better outcome.  not as powerful as the ones I had before, but that was not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> Light and it works wonder, it dries my wife&#x27;s hair really fast like 2-4minutes, her hair length is to her butt. Worth the price you paid! The best product made by Revlon!</li>
    <li> Good little hair dryer. Nothing to write home about but it dose the job. I don&#x27;t really see any difference from this one and the one I had previously that didn&#x27;t have ionization, ceramic and whatnot. But it works well enough. :-)</li>
    <li> Dries my hair much faster than previous driers. Great for the cost.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot. Not as good as reviews suggested but good bargain for the price. does the job well.</li>
    <li> Do not really blow dry my air on a regular basis.  I only used this once, but it worked very effectively and dried my hair quickly.  The cost on Amazon was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. I found the power is very strong so my hair can be dried up very quickly.</li>
    <li> One year now, still working like the first day, not too loud and heats like a professional salon like blower. I like it comes with concentrator and diffuser.</li>
    <li> I have used this dryer for years and love it.</li>
    <li> The wife loves it! I talked her into it and she glad i did. Saves her time in the morning so that&#x27;s great! We would buy again!!</li>
    <li> Such a good price and it works great!  It does have power, which is exactly what I wanted.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This replaces my old vidal sasson with ionic technology. I must say that I love this hair dryer. It works much better than my old one. I have fine wavy hair that tends to frizz and this really smoothes it out. Even though my hair is fine I have alot of it and this dries my hair very quickly. My hair also feels healthier. Love this dryer and love the price. I thought about getting an expensive CHI but couldn&#x27;t bear to pay the price. I am very happy with this dryer and think I can live without the CHI. I also like the silver color of this dryer.</li>
    <li> Like others have noted, ours started shooting sparks. We have owned it for 14 months. It was a great hair dryer before... but this is clearly dangerous. We use it daily, then put it away in a drawer. This regular movement was enough - apparently - to cause the cord to break and shoot sparks.</li>
    <li> Great price for quality of blow dryer and diffuser included.</li>
    <li> I only have the special plug  in the kitchen so may have to put a new electrical connection in the bathroom, otherwise everything works just fine.  The low setting is esp. nice. not too hot  just right and on most hair dryers i&#x27;ve had it hasn&#x27;t worked well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good hair dryer for the price. I needed an upgrade since I only had the dryer that I have used since I was ten and am now 22. It&#x27;s not too heavy and it dries my long hair pretty fast. I&#x27;m too impatient to learn how to use the attachments though.</li>
    <li> cord burned where it meets the actual hair dryer just like everyone else. Was good while it lasted, but serious safety hazard!</li>
    <li> Sparking and fire at same junction all others showed!!  I have had this blow dryer since late Feb 2014.  It is the best dryer I have ever owned and feel disappointed that I have to write this but... the exact same thing that a few people below describe happened to me last night.  It stop working all of a sudden and I thought I just had to reset the fuse when all of a sudden I heard crackling, zap and a loud pop sound.  I looked down and a small flame was coming out of the EXACT juncture all the people below have shown pictures of.  I screamed, blew out the fire and looked to see what on earth had happened.  I was actually considering sending mine back since it is still within the 2 year warranty or even just getting a new once since it&#x27;s only $20, but after seeing that this is not just a &amp;#34;one-off&amp;#34; event, I am thinking I better get something different.  Just lucky I was the one using it at the time and not my children!!</li>
    <li> Good because I don&#x27;t need to worry about showering at midnight and not being able to go to bed immediately after shower any more,lol</li>
    <li> I really love this blow dryer. It was for a great price compared to stores, it arrived on time and works wonderful. It was a great purchase over all and im very satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent blow dryer for the price. Light &amp; easy to handle. The Warm setting is perfect and Hot is very hot. Forceful enough that it constantly blows things off my bathroom counter. In other words, it does the job quickly. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works well and suits my needs!  I especially like the diffuser for my permed hair.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves this hair dryer..she uses it everyday!</li>
    <li> Great Product and fast shipping. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> it has a very bad smell to it after only 5 months of use. was great until then, not too loud and worked well, but the burning smell so quickly after purchase is why i gave it a low rating</li>
    <li> My girl-friend had used and went through many types of hair dryer in the past and wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with it until I got her this one and she loves it. The dryer runs pretty quite, light weight and really put out major heat, enough heat it would fry your hair. I would definitely buy another-one when this unit burns out.</li>
    <li> We received this dryer 20 March and it failed 16 May.  It&#x27;s totally failed and it&#x27;s not caused by the safety plug being tripped.  The return time frame on this is only 30 days too, so I can&#x27;t send it back to Amazon.  I&#x27;m looking at options now.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Great dryer. I don&#x27;t use the round part because my hair are super fine and dry super quickly anyway ;)</li>
    <li> Still running strong after four years, which amazes me considering the low price.  Dries hair quickly and with almost no static build up.  The only technical problem I experienced is sometimes the cool air button would get lodged on and I would have to wiggle it out to restore heat.  Will most likely buy another when the fateful day comes that my current drier ascends to wet hair heaven.</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is that it only has 2 speeds and 2 temperatures.  Other than that it is perfect.  It&#x27;s light, it worked so well, and the price was more than right.</li>
    <li> not as expected. very light and quiet&lt;br /&gt;but did not dry my hair faster compare to my old cheap dryer and did not make my hair smoother. gave it away</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair dryer.  I have medium length hair and I can blow dry it completely within 10 minutes. WOW!  Definitely a great recommendation if you are looking for an inexpensive and effective hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Works great, stays hot, and Ive had it for a couple of months now. No complaints and would def recommend</li>
    <li> I bought two of these (I have 3 females with long hair in the house) on October 4, 2013. Neither made it 6 months, On one the motor started running slow after 3 months. I sent an email to Revlon only to be told I needed to contact another company (Helen of Troy  [...]) for any issues. The second one just failed 5/1/2014, It started cutting on and off. After inspection, one of cables in the power cord had started to separate (not a short, actually starting to break) near the handle. This pretty much tell me that they used too small of a gauge wire to support the load. The built in GFCI will not protect anyone from this. If your hand is one the cord and it breaks (burns through) get ready to electrocuted. And for those who don&#x27;t understand, yes that can kill you, 1875W/120V&#x3D;15.625A plenty enough to blow your heart to shreds if the circuit is completed across your body. If you don&#x27;t mind accidental death then this is the product for you.    I bought these based on reviews, but from my point of view they should be recalled and the customer should be refunded.</li>
    <li> the power on this thing is great! i wanted another hair dryer to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s house. At home I have a T3, which is great but was super expensive so I wasn&#x27;t about to buy another one of those just to have an extra. I got this one because it had good reviews and it is super powerful! Definitely compares to my $200+ dryer which is very impressive. Love it!</li>
    <li> I loved this hairdryer for the price...gets the job done fast and so lightweight!! It&#x27;s the perfect hairdryer for traveling.</li>
    <li> I have an expensive Ionic dryer that&#x27;ve use while at home. I was looking for an inexpensive dryer to take with me when I travel, and this is it. Not too big to pack, and it has all the qualities you need to dry your hair. It keeps the shine and dries my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Revlon 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer features Tourmaline Ionic Technology for ultimate shine, volume, and healthier looking styles. This dryer has an ion indicator light, separate heat and speed switches, 2 heat/2 speed settings, cold shot button, hinged endcap, anti-skid bumpers, and concentrator and finger diffuser attachments. This ultra lightweight design is 25% lighter than my other dryer and has a sleek and upscale spray finish. This unit is super quiet and fast drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-03-14</li>
    <li> Very light and less noisy compared to other hair dryers. Dries hair efficiently. Learned about this particular hair dryer when I hours sit for my employer.</li>
    <li> Great product at an amazing price. This blow dryer is light weight, quiet, and gets the job done. I am a licensed cosmetologist and have used all ranges of blow dryers and this honestly is my favorite dryer for home as of yet. I am so happy it comes with the attachments too. What a steal!</li>
    <li> this item was listed as being quiet&lt;br /&gt;so i bought it for wife for xmas&lt;br /&gt;she used it and its not any quieter then the one she was useing</li>
    <li> No qualms about this. Works as expected. I use it once in a while since my hair isn&#x27;t too long.</li>
    <li> I *feel* like it dries my hair relatively fast (I have extremely long hair down to my butt and it&#x27;s thick).  It probably takes me about 10 minutes to dry.  With my other hair dryers it usually took somewhere around 15.  Sometimes 5 minutes is everything I suppose.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer because of the price.  It was going to be used by my out of state visiting daughters.  I tried it first and loved the way it made my hair smooth, shine, and less flyaways.  so I kept it for me and gave them the one I was using.  I didn&#x27;t realize there could be such a difference in hairdryers especially at this pricepoint</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I went to visit my sister and she had an ionic hair dryer and it worked really well so I had to have my own. This one is perfect! It dries my hair faster than my normal hair dryer and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with that stringy dry look. Instead, my hair is smooth and shiny. I don&#x27;t even have to use a hair straightener. I just put some argon oil in my hair and then blow dry and I&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s loud, yeah. But it&#x27;s a hair dryer, so I expected that. It&#x27;s quieter than ones I&#x27;ve had before, but louder than ones I&#x27;ve seen in really nice salons. Still, it dries my hair pretty quickly (I have past-shoulder-length, medium-curly hair) and the diffuser attachment is a godsend for my curls. Having hot/warm and high/low settings are pretty great too. My only sadness is that if you want cool air, you have to hold down the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button - you can&#x27;t just hit it once and have it stay cool the whole time. Even so, the buttons are ergonomically placed, so all you have to do is readjust your finger placement. Also, I&#x27;ve had this thing for over a year and it&#x27;s never burnt out, blown a fuse, or let me down in any way in terms of performance. 8/10, would buy again.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer itself works well but it only came with the diffuser attachment and not the concentrator attachement, which is what I need the most to blow dry my hair. I was going to try to buy a universal attachment but everyone&#x27;s review of them say they either don&#x27;t fit their blow dryer or they melt. Wasn&#x27;t worth it so I returned it. Check with the seller first!</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair and this cut my drying time by about a third. Definitely worth buying. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A very weak blow dryer &amp; the attachment came broken.  Doesn&#x27;t get hot so hair takes longer to blow dry.</li>
    <li> siso excellent purchases have so far</li>
    <li> A very nice hair dryer......small toughen to take on trips.....and it dries the hair very quickly.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Replaced a working 6 year old hair dryer with this. It lasted 14 months. The stress relief for the non swivel power chord is a joke. Its as flimsy as the chord itself. It bent to the point of shorting out and throwing sparks in my wife&#x27;s hair!!!! Dangerous piece junk!! BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> The ionic ceramic feature is excellent for my hair, but more than that, it comes standard with a diffuser and an attachment that forces the air directly on my roots. Somewhat larger in size than many models and it doesn&#x27;t fold for traveling, but it&#x27;s perfect for my at-home use. One other thing is that the attachments stay on tight and don&#x27;t fall off as some other brands I&#x27;ve owned. I also like the fact of being able to clean lint, dust, and hair in the removable end cap.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer less than a year ago. I have liked the way my hair looks and feels after using it. This morning, though, while using the dryer I heard a crackling sound, then a flame shot out of the dryer right where the cord attaches. That flame went out, then another appeared. I pulled the power cord out if the wall, let the dryer cool down, then threw it away.</li>
    <li> Great light heairdryer with long cord.Don&#x27;t really use the hot setting, but low setting is perfect. Dries my short hair in no time</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is awesome. Produces excellent heat and dries hair quickly. The cool setting is very cool and works well. The attachments fit amazing and really &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; onto the end of the drier- they won&#x27;t come off even if you accidentally drop it.</li>
    <li> Is to slow I don&#x27;t recomended</li>
    <li> Especially love this dryer because it is so light.  It drys hair quickly and leave my fine hair full of volume.  This is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!! IT&#x27;S SO FAST AND LIGHT!!</li>
    <li> It is light and does not make a lot of noise.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and found this dryer worked very well for me. I used the high and hot settings and then did a blast of cold to set the style and help with shine. I have had this dryer for a year. I would have given it 5 stars but today it sent up a small poof and smoke and sent large sparks flying when I first turned it on. However, it wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive for a year of daily use. I am considering getting another one.</li>
    <li> it works so good it drys your hair so fast. The price was great i like the fact that you can change it to how you want to dry you hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Revlon hair dryer for 8-9 mos now. A few weeks ago it started malfunctioning; would stop running if I turned it at certain angles, started smelling strangely, etc. I first thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t connected to the wall socket completely or had come loose being shaken around so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, after using it a bit longer with the stop/start hassle every morning, last week it stopped working altogether.  I have short hair so I know the dryer wasn&#x27;t over-heating. Not to mention, even for this inexpensive price I would expect a hair dryer to last way longer than just several months! Thankfully I have a small travel dryer I used as a back up; otherwise would&#x27;ve started my day @ work with a wet head and not so happy.  :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did bring this defective product to the attention of Amazon cust. service. They couldn&#x27;t have handled it any better for me, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the dryer when it was still working, I&#x27;d say so-so for the review. Mainly bec the buttons are on the handle (as normal), so I found my hand was often changing the settings unintentionally. They are just easily bumped/switched while using. There&#x27;s really no room on the handle for my hand. It&#x27;s also pretty bulky.  I don&#x27;t really have anything spectacular to say about this dryer... even before it died!</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price! Dry my hair very quickly, and I have a lot of hair! I recommend this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> The Revlon RV544PKF hair dryer works well, with strong volume of moving air, good heat controls, convenient attachments for diffusing and concentrating air and sturdy design.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer!  I would definitely purchase another one.  My only caveat is that it&#x27;s pretty big and bulky so it is not great for traveling.</li>
    <li> So, I have struggled with frizz my whole life and even with hundreds of dollars of product I could never get smooth results. Until Now! This blow dryer is amazing! The first time I used it we had rain, so the humidity was @ 100%.  My hair was smooth all day just like after my hair dresser does it! And it lasted two days in the rain!! Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> This dryer worked OK for about a year when the fan started to malfunction.  You have to deal with Hellen of Troy customer service who makes the unit, not Revlon.  They ask you to ship the unit back to them which is inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;Things to remember are:&lt;br /&gt;(1) There is a warranty fee that they will waive only if you ask.&lt;br /&gt;(2) they ask you to pay for shipping but I asked to rep to reimburse me the cost of shipping.  So I apparently will get a physical check some time in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a fine dryer but I&#x27;m surprised Revlon will ruin their good name by forcing customers into this strange and inconvenient warranty process.</li>
    <li> Not sure why this is top rated. As a stylist of 25 years I saw nothing special but hey it dries so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I like the wattage on this product for the price. It has a great feel to it, it&#x27;s cosmetically pretty and its high powered. Great buy, definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been blow-dry-ing my hair since 1977 and this is the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had and it was $20 I highly, highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> My daughter (who has very long fine hair) received this for her birthday.  She was glad I got it for her.</li>
    <li> Incredible. I can dry my thick, long hair in 8 minutes. Love it. Also it&#x27;s not too loud.</li>
    <li> This dryer works well and I like the temperature settings. This came with 2 attachments. I like the big one for curly hair. This dryer not too loud. This is the second one in four years. The price so cheap.  I alway buy Revlon hair Dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed by how quickly this product dries my hair.  I have a pretty thick head of hair, and this has cut down my drying time from 10 minutes to 5.  Good product for the price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this dryer for myself. I did not want to purchase an expensive one and this works very well for my needs</li>
    <li> It does what a hairdryer is suppose to do. I don&#x27;t understand how an ion dryer is suppose to work. It&#x27;s as fast as my old Sassoon dryer that I had for over 6 years but die recently.  It gives me just what I expected. I think the large removable attachment is great  for quick drying. If you have used a blow dryer most of your life, you know what to expect.. If it last as long as my old one, it will be a  steal. At this  post, I don&#x27;t have any negative feedback. It worth the cost.</li>
    <li> great hairdyer and good price. Light to hold.  Drys hair fast.  However, hair dryer lasted about 1 year and started making clanging noises.  I would still buy another one since you can consider it disposable.</li>
    <li> VERY DISAPPOINTING!  Received as a Christmas gift and used for only 4 months, maybe a bit less.  It suddenly started cutting out to the point where you&#x27;d have to turn it a certain way to make it stay on!  Who the heck can dry their hair in this manner!!!  This morning it sparked, caught on fire, and shorted out as I screamed and threw it to the ground.  THANK GOODNESS it wasn&#x27;t near my face and didn&#x27;t burn me or, worse yet, burn my entire house down.  Will NEVER buy another Revlon hair dryer again!  Reading through hundreds of reviews here on Amazon AND on the internet, it is quite apparent this thing is defective and a real fire/safety hazard.  REVLON SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!  And the fact that they don&#x27;t even have the decency to respond to customer complaints via their website or phone is ridiculous!!  Bottom line:  ***DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER !! ***</li>
    <li> Really good, dries my hair fast and easy!!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t  damage  my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I used it for a few months and it all of a sudden just stops working, I had to dig out an old blow dryer to finish my hair and it worked better.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this blowdryer. I love it when it works. I love its lightness. I love the ease of the controls. I love that it has a hot, medium and cool blast button. I love that is has high and low settings. I love how quickly it dries my hair. But...  I HATE it because the motor dies in less than a year. Yes, I have purchased three of this model, hoping that each one won&#x27;t die a premature death.  But, alas, the high whine began again intermittently a month ago. Then the whine occurred  every time I turned it to the high setting. Finally, it just gave up the ghost (fortunately it didn&#x27;t shoot sparks and fire out at me this time).  So now I&#x27;m off to research a blow dryer with longevity that I can grow to love like this one.  On a side note...I&#x27;m going to try out the warranty this time...I&#x27;ll keep my fingers crossed that</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer based on the high numbers of positive reviews, but now I must add my own identical experience and photo to so many others.  After about 9 months of use, one day the dryer started turning on and off randomly during use and emitting sparks from the cord right where the cord meets the dryer.  I looked at the cord and saw the exposed wire.  This has to be a defective product.  Please don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Came with everything tgats included. And my wife is very happy. Thank you Amazon. For great service</li>
    <li> Works fine for me,.. thats about it nothing left to say yep nothing else just works fine haha ha ha</li>
    <li> Lightweight looks good excellent price</li>
    <li> Dries fine, but doesn&#x27;t have the heat or the air flow that my old dryer had.  Takes longer to dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this just before Christmas and with Moderate use the cord has already cracked and shorted out.  Performance was good while it lasted.  We are use to wearing these quite every few years but not in less than 8 months.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer performs exactly as described. The drying time is significantly lower than with older hair dryers, and that&#x27;s when using the lower heat setting. I&#x27;m at an age when the less heat needed saves me a strand or two!&lt;br /&gt;The two attachments are exactly what I wanted. Also, this replaced a Revlon dryer I had been using for years.</li>
    <li> Stopped working in a month</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these dryers based on the price point and good reviews back in January. After only a couple of months, the dryer suddenly started sparking out of the handle one morning (??) and the motor completely blew out. Revlon was kind enough to send me a replacement free-of-charge, but that one stopped working this morning! What a waste of money. Do NOT purchase this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. I have had it for years and it still works great. My hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in it and I love the button you can push to get a cold blast of air.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use as a second hair dryer to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s place. I was looking for a reputable brand with good reviews, but also a low price. This met all of my qualifications. It is a great value for the price and it works just as I need it to. I love the cool air blast button that I can use to finish off my curls and cool myself down. The ions seem to leave a nice shine in my hair as well, and it dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Appreciate the light weight and ease of use when it worked. However, the on/off bottom stopped working after less than one year of use. This was the shortest longevity of all hair dryers that I have ever owed.</li>
    <li> as other reviewers have mentioned, this dryer lasted me one year. But for this price, it&#x27;s worth getting a new one each year if necessary. It is so lightweight and so quiet that I can&#x27;t chance trying another one. No wonder it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;best seller.&amp;#34; Customers have to replace it so often.  Updated: 6/25/2015 - I purchased another of these dryers, and I was very disappointed that it came without the hanging loop. I think the loop is important so I don&#x27;t have to wrap the cord. I made a homemade loop with one of the twist-ties in the box, but it probably won&#x27;t last long. So minus one star for lasting only a year and minus one star for no hanging loop. It&#x27;s still light and quiet.</li>
    <li> I owned this dryer and bought another for our Florida place--true praise. I recycled the &amp;#34;add-ons&amp;#34; (shown) that came with it for my short thick hair--but really love the dryer--strong air-flow and gets the job done. Could be available in a smaller version--but we can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s perfect but this is the second 1 I&#x27;ve bought. The 1st 1 died after many years of abuse so I purchased a second 1. You can&#x27;t beat the price for a good blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter who is extremely hard on hair dryers. She has very thick hair. She likes this and it works great. The ionic dryers work best to tame frizzy hair. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Its always hard to know if hairdryers will live up to expectations when you buy them but so far I love this one.  I chose it after reading the reviews and must say I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Puts out good heat, but not to hot.  The attachments actually stay on even when she tosses it around.  She technically likes it, but doesn&#x27;t have any complaints to take away a star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 5 and 1/2 months and the handle gets so hot that it burned my hand today.  It is increasingly getting worse and worse the more I use it.  I&#x27;m at the point now where I have to dry half of my hair and then turn the dryer off and wait until it cools and then dry the other half.  I looked up my order history today so I could return the dryer but it says I can no longer return it.  You should be able to have a dryer for more than just a few months and I am very upset that I can&#x27;t return a defective dryer.</li>
    <li> This dry seems to not blow as hot as my last one did, but my hair is dry in the same amount of time or less. Not sure how that happens, but I like it. It is light weight, but not flimsy.</li>
    <li> Worked just fine for 6 months then shorted out, shooting sparks from the bottom of the handle and burned through the cord Burned my wife&#x27;s hand and would have burned my house down if she hadn&#x27;t quickly unplugged it!</li>
    <li> Works great! Dries my hair fast and isn&#x27;t super heavy. No complaints here. Attachments work as they should. Great hair dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It dries my hair. It is not too heavy. I have a lot of hair and it doesn&#x27;t kill or damage the hair.</li>
    <li> This is my dedicated hair dryer when I want to blow dry my hair curly.  The finger diffuser attachment is great.  Not quite enough power for drying my hair straight, though.</li>
    <li> Great Product for the price. It really adds volume to my thin hair. Good size product and great packaging. Overall really enjoy the product for the price.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this product. It is fast to dry her hair and easy to use. Well design and perfect size.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Light weight, dries hair fast, works great!  Very powerful. Was pleasantly surprised on such a cheap product that turned out to be more than I expected :)</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. However, I am quite pleased with this hair dryer. Another reviewer mentioned that the on/off switch is a bit misplaced...and it is. But you soon get used to it.</li>
    <li> This dryer has worked miracles on my hair! I have a very unique texture of hair so when I gave it a spin the first time and it only took me a matter OF MINUTES to be completely dry, I was shocked and stunned! The concentrator works wonders. It’s all around THE best hair dryer I have ever owned. I blow dry my hair even more now that I did previously! You really can’t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair, it dries it very quickly.  Leaves it shinny and smooth.  This is the second time I purchased this product, owned a previous version for 10 years.  Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> According to the fiance this is the best hair dryer she has ever used. Dries her hair very quickly and contrary to what some have said about the size is not much larger than her old one. Average size according to her.</li>
    <li> Sadly, despite how great my hair looked after drying it using this hair drier, it burnt out just after one year of using it...and I have short hair!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, it feels good (really, the air feels good on your head), it has a cold shot button, and it gets hot enough to dry hair quickly AND to get wrinkles out of window plastic. It fits in a drawer. Only down side is the on/off button is placed such that I often turn the dryer off by accident.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the purchase of this unit. It&#x27;s much quieter than my previous model and is definitely worth the money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Yep, that&#x27;s what it does - dries hair. It&#x27;s not horrible (especially for the price), but there&#x27;s nothing special about it either. Pay no attention to the claim that it makes your hair shinier, because it doesn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t add volume, either. However, when I purchased this, I didn&#x27;t expect either of the claims to hold up - I bought it to dry my hair, and it did...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this in 2010, and had to toss it in the middle of 2013 because the cord started sparking when I plugged it in. I like hair dryers that get hot, but not *that* hot... so in the trash it went. That said, lasting 2 1/2 years at the price I paid is okay with me.</li>
    <li> It takes me FOREVER to dry my super long and thick hair and no hair dryer has ever been enough.. until now. I love this hair dryer. The attachments are easy to take on and off, it cuts back on my drying time and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair while leaving it smooth and styled. Great product !</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is decently made but does not seem any more powerful than the one I had from &amp;#62;10 years ago.</li>
    <li> I liked it. Its not supper loud and gets very hot. Im a guy with long hair and thought It might be time to start blow drying it and it works. I dont know how to use the accessories or anything so I cant really comment on them.</li>
    <li> Replaced my older, heavy and loud blow dryer with this one. I really like it. Wish it had a retractable cord, but it wasn&#x27;t a deal-breaker for me as I store it under my sink. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and dries fast.</li>
    <li> love it and use it everyday...dry hair fast.</li>
    <li> I liked this hair dryer, but it only lasted a couple months.  I purchased it in February and it is now only June and it started sparking where the cord meets the handle of the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for about 3-4 years now. I will say that for the price, it works GREAT. It leaves my hair smooth and silky and has never quit working or slowed down. What I find to be the most irritating is that as this thing ages, the silver on it will fleck-off everywhere. God knows what that silver material is made out of. I don&#x27;t like the idea of it being on my skin, let alone flaking off and breathing it in. If it weren&#x27;t for that, I&#x27;d probably give this hair dryer a 4 star rating. I&#x27;d be hesitant to give it 5 because the thing is still awfully loud. We&#x27;ll have to purchase a different hair dryer that isn&#x27;t quite as cheap.</li>
    <li> I use this almost every day. I still have no idea how to use the finger diffuser, but the concentrator works well. By itself the hair drying works perfectly.</li>
    <li> 1st one lasted 6 mos. and died. Bought a replacement/  died in 6 weeks. I won&#x27;t get a 3rd.</li>
    <li> Terrific value! Heats up quickly and has excellent blower power. This hair dryer is great for the price being sold.</li>
    <li> My daughter says it is lightweight, not very loud and her hair doesn&#x27;t frizz even when she just blow dries it.  Best dryer she has ever had.</li>
    <li> Such a great blowdryer! Light weight! Love the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting and additional defuser attachment. Purchased this when it was on sale for less than $20 here. Great buy!</li>
    <li> The head piece of this hair dryer melted on the high heat setting as I was drying my hair:( thankfully my hair didn&#x27;t get burned. It wasn&#x27;t as quiet as I had expected...still rather loud. I returned this item.</li>
    <li> Fairly light and easy to handle. I have short hair and this dryer dries it in less than 5 minutes.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy to handle and use for long hair, frizzy hair, etc. glad I got this one. Hubby bought a different hair dryer for himself and very unhappy! Looks like I&#x27;ll be sharing mine.</li>
    <li> Excellent all-around product. Hair dries quickly and comes out soft.</li>
    <li> I did not see anything special about this hair dryer. I do not believe that it dries my hair any faster than other dryers but it does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought this Revlon hair dryer 3 weeks ago. I really like it. It takes half a time to dry my hair compared to my old dryer. And thanks to the defuser and a salon styling tool I can get a better styling results. I also like warm/hot options and 2 different air blowing options.  If you have thick hair with stubborn curl you would like it.</li>
    <li> very easy to use and great price for the product</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. I had high hopes for this blow dryer because of the reviews but it&#x27;s just meh in my opinion. The different settings are nice but it doesn&#x27;t blow very hard. To me it feels like it has a diffuser already on it. It is very lightweight which is nice but it&#x27;s so lightweight that the plastic body just feels cheap. For less than $20, I guess it&#x27;s ok but I&#x27;m going to make this my backup/travel blow dryer and get a better one for everyday use.</li>
    <li> All in all it performs like it should. My only complaints would be that it doesn&#x27;t seem like it has the amount of power I was expecting and the concentrator can get really hot. For the price, I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Nice dryer that was powerful.  I did say \\&quot;was\\&quot;!  It lasted one month and then just quit.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing dryer I have ever owned, and I have really weird hair!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this dryer to use temporarily while my T3 Tourmaline is being repaired. I didn&#x27;t want to spend alot on a temp dryer and since this dryer had such favorable reviews, I thought I would give it a shot. I was skeptical that this inexpensive dryer would work as well as my pricey T3. And to my surprise - it did! I cannot see a difference when using either dryer. Both are amazing. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because of the cord length. It&#x27;s much shorter compared to my other hair appliances. It&#x27;s a very minor complaint and definitely not worth having second thoughts over purchasing this product. It&#x27;s an excellent second dryer to own. It&#x27;s also light weight and will be great to use when traveling.</li>
    <li> extremely light-weight, dries hair super fast--i ordered one for my sister and my mom loved it so much she&#x27;s asked me to order one for her as well!</li>
    <li> I really like this dryer:  Great price, works great, BUT the handle/switch design is a little awkward, as I sometimes shut it off while drying my hair!  I just wish the controls were placed differently or were a slide kind of switch, instead of the button-type.  It sticks out a bit too much making it a little uncomfortable in your hand!  You get used to it after a while.  Relatively quiet, dries my medium length, thick hair pretty fast!</li>
    <li> Well have only used it once but it is good I guess. Item arrived rather fast. I bought it along with a conair hair styler. Works fine</li>
    <li> We got this for grooming our Portuguese Water Dog, whose hair (\\&quot;fur\\&quot;) is very human-like. The dryer is light and easy to handle, and the combination of diffuser and concentrator allow for lots of options. There is a convenient button in the \\&quot;trigger\\&quot; location that lets you turn off the heating element-- this is  great feature so you can keep the heat on a higher setting, and let it cool a bit without losing the warm air flow. I haven&#x27;t used a hair dryer on my hair since long hair on men was fashionable (yes, I&#x27;m THAT old!) but if the dog is any indication, I think this is  great unit for the money.</li>
    <li> I liked this hair dryer when I first got it.  Worked well, although I didn&#x27;t think the tourmaline made any difference.    After using it twice a week for 7 weeks, it just stopped working.  I tried the reset button -- nothing.  I waited till the next day to try again, with the same results.  I didn&#x27;t drop it, I didn&#x27;t get it wet.  Nothing was done to it and yet it stopped dead.    I called Revlon and was told I could return it to them for an exchange.  However, as it cost me $18.99 when I purchased it last Nov., and it would cost me approx. $8 to return it and another $5 for them to return it to me, I didn&#x27;t bother.    I am extremely disappointed in this blowdryer and will never purchase anything from Revlon again.  I guess this is just more junk made in China.  I&#x27;m going back to my 25 year old Gillette dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer for my daughter and paid $16.99. I noticed that the price is higher now. But if you wait patiently and check back periodically, the price may come down again. This hairdryer is very light weighted and it dries hair very fast. My daughter just loves it. I would recommend it very much.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, just as advertised. I feel noticeable smoothness in my hair after using it. Also, it dries very fast. Don&#x27;t care too much for the heat diffuser attachment because my hair isn&#x27;t thick enough to benefit from it. Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair dryer,fast,and easy to clean and for money is best, thanks again amazon.</li>
    <li> Cord is very short, but I use an extension cord with it and is fine.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is no joke.  Lightweight and easy to use.  Great power and relatively quiet.</li>
    <li> Quality hair dryer, I read other reviews about the power switch, and I have had no issues with it and have never once turned it off by accident.</li>
    <li> Great dryer.  It has nultiple seeting and a cold shock button.  Love this dryer b/c it blows hard and dries quickly.  It has 2 attachments that help but I haven&#x27;t used them.  I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This dryer is great quality for the money. It does dry hair quicker than my old ion dryer and seems to be overall more gentle on the hair - less \\&quot;frying\\&quot; out of the hair even on the hot/high setting. This is really helpful for me because my young daughter has long thick hair. It is convenient to be able to get her hair dry as quickly as possible without damaging it. I have fine curly hair and it works great for me too - I use the concentrator for my roots first and the diffuser for all-over drying. The different choices of speed and heat settings are great including the cool shot. I&#x27;d recommend this dryer - it is so nice to get a good deal on a quality product.    Update: July 31, 2011 - Well, unfortunately this dryer has stopped working. It started just cutting off and then actually set off a burst of sparks while I was holding it and smelled like a burnt heating element. I won&#x27;t be using it anymore of course and will now work on getting a refund or replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer because it&#x27;s rated #1 best selling on Amazon. What a disappointment! It&#x27;s not as powerful as my other dryer. The high speed is about the same as the low speed of the other dryer. It&#x27;s going back to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Cord went bad ten days after return window was up.  Now it shirts out when using it .  Maybe it&#x27;s just a faulty dryer.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm - the buttons and the light make it seem a little bit cheap.... However it&#x27;s a really good dryer.  Very light.  Simple.</li>
    <li> I use it for home, and I have a really short hair. So I think this one is totally enough for me. Just a simple nice hair dryer. Good for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too big for a regular pillow and it&#x27;s not 100% satin. Overall nice to sleep on. Worth the money paid.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for one of my friends and so far she loves it. The diffuser attachment is a bonus as she said. It just gives her curls so much more curl and less frizz</li>
    <li> The first one lasted about an year. It started making a really loud noise until it eventually died. I ordered another one. It started making a noise after only two weeks. It still works but the noise is getting worse and it is only a matter of time...</li>
    <li> it last long, I have used this for three years. The hot air is powerful and so is the cool air. Nice</li>
    <li> Works well - serves it&#x27;s purpose</li>
    <li> Fast drying hair dryer, worked well with curly hair for a natural look with minimal frizz.</li>
    <li> The cord is obnoxiously short and the cold air button does not give you cold air. The attachments are fine, but the short cord really hinders what I can do with them.</li>
    <li> word of caution using the dryer after three weeks the cord sparked and melted, not sure what happend but wanted to make consumers aware.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as described. The accessories supplied with the product works well.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is good for the price it came in very fast and it is working great for now it came well packed and with good instructions, it seems well made and will update later after several uses so far so good.</li>
    <li> This dryer has a great fit and the buttons do not get in they way while you dry your hair! Very powerful!</li>
    <li> Love this product, cannot ask for more.</li>
    <li> Great item for the price! I have used this daily for a few months now and have zero issues!</li>
    <li> After reading all the good reviews, I decided to purchase this.  I was very disappointed.This hair dryer keeps over-heating and shutting off.  I may have received a defective one.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. I&#x27;m a dude. I guess I may be easy to please. Bought it when I had super long hair and it worked great. Fast dry and great result. Now my hair is short. I use it quickly after combing my hair to help the gel harden.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer worked great for a year and a half (loved the diffuser), but then it suddenly started turning off an on while I used it. I discovered the cord was loose where it meets the hard plastic at the bottom of the handle, and it can&#x27;t be fixed. I had my last hair dryer for over ten years. I got rid of it just so I could get one with a better diffuser. I only used it for about 5 minutes a day and hung it on a hook the rest of the time. So it wasn&#x27;t mishandled. Oh well, maybe I just got a dud, but I&#x27;m not taking chances on another one. Revlon really needs to work on this.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer in May 2014 and its stopped working in June 15.It seems to be, adapter is gone..feeling burning smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please look at the warranty information before buying this product. Warranty coverage does not make any sense. Since, you have to pay both shipping charges which would cost around almost the product price :-)</li>
    <li> Great dryer. I have thick hair that usually takes forever to dry. This definitely cut down on the drying time and my hair is softer and smoother than with my my old non ionic dryer.</li>
    <li> The functions are good.</li>
    <li> This Revlon dryer gets one star because when I had to plug it into about a dozen outlets before frustratingly realizing it did not work. Only use i find for it is as a prop in a silent, on-stage play.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Every outlet in my home works perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> Love that the hair dryer, it is really light weight. Also great that it came with a diffuser but just wish the diffuser was easier to connect.</li>
    <li> I have owned many blow dryers, none of them cost more than $30 ever, but this one was the worst I&#x27;ve ever used - including hotel dryers.  I changed nothing in my hair care regimen (not shampoo/conditioner, hair product, dying) accept for using this new blowdryer because my previous one broke.  I thought &amp;#34;what a deal!&amp;#34; but in this case I got what I paid for - which ended up being split ends and hair that was straw-like.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Have used the Revlon blower previously. This new one is lighter than my others.</li>
    <li> Love that it&#x27;s very light for a full size dryer. It dries my hair fast and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry it out. So far very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It is a quite complete hair dryer I just wish it had cold air!&lt;br /&gt;The warm air is good and hot is really hot!</li>
    <li> This blow-dryer is very hot and dries my hair in a minute or two.  It is very pleasant to use.  It&#x27;s also not too loud.</li>
    <li> Seems to dry my thick hair very quickly. I appreciate that it comes with the diffuser for easier styling. Overall a good value.</li>
    <li> I have short hair.  This is a lightweight dryer and has no nonsense controls.  It does a great job and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.</li>
    <li> It literally blew my mind.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine blow dryer...not great not horrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about Four years now. It has been a great hair dryer up until the last week. A strange noise started, but it didn&#x27;t change the performance so I just kept using it. Well,  I was just using it this morning and it made a popping sound and exploded in my face! There was smoke everywhere. I&#x27;m extremely hesitant to purchase one again, but for the price and the quality that I received for four years, I think I&#x27;ll give it one more shot.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer but I haven&#x27;t noticed the tourmaline/ionic/ceramic feature doing anything a regular hair dryer doesn&#x27;t do. Love the diffuser attachment.</li>
    <li> The last hair dryer I had was from beauty school.  It was a top of the line dryer - professional grade and so on.  The reason I wanted a new dryer was because it was starting to get a little beat up and I was looking for something light and something that works quickly.  This is the best dryer I&#x27;ve owned - it dries my hair in probably 6 minutes and I have long hair, and a lot of it. It works so well without burning, I think it&#x27;s because the power of the air is very strong so it&#x27;s very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it, plus you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> ..but I swear this dryer dries my hair quicker, and leaves it shinier, than other driers I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;m generally not picky when it comes to driers, and basically purchased this one for its low price, so its good quality and magical hair powers have been a nice bonus.  UPDATE: This morning I experienced the sparking problem some of the other reviewers had.  I was styling my hair, smelled smoked, and all of a sudden the cord near my wrist erupted in sparks.  I loved everything about this blow drier...except that.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this hair dryer. Fast and powerful, dries my thick straight Asian hair in less than 7 min and that&#x27;s unheard of. All my other dryers left my hair frizzy unless used some type product. Not this one! Didn&#x27;t have to use any anti frizz gel. The technology leaves your hair shiny silky and smooth. If I could 10 stars I would.</li>
    <li> The wife&#x27;s hair looks great, so I can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> Love it.  It is light but powerful, does the job well!</li>
    <li> Pros: Delivers the same quality and heat of far more expensive hairdryers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neurtral: 1 of the extra attachments was not very useful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does get hot quickly</li>
    <li> It works perfectly I have not used the accessories yet but I feel happy with it is not so heavy but is not a travel dryer.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new hair dryer and talking to a coworker about it, the next day she brought her&#x27;s in (which was the Revlon RV544PKF) and said take it home and use it this weekend and let me know what you think.  So I did and WOW! I thought I had a decent hair dryer before but this hair dryer was amazing.  I have thick long hair and with my old dryer it took about 35 minutes to dry, now that time has been cut in half.  It has a few settings high and low, and warm and hot- it&#x27;s just enough.  The tourmaline technology my hair feels healthier than ever.  You can&#x27;t beat this hair dryer at this price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything exceptional about this dryer, but I had the Revlon folding one which worked way better than this one did.  However, the cool shot button on this works great!  It&#x27;s a hair dryer, what else can I say - nothing extraordinary.  But I do not notice any static after blow drying my hair like some other dryers.  This is a good thing!</li>
    <li> This works great! This is the first blower dryer I have bought in years and I am very pleased with this one! I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast. The hair drier is good and works perfect. No problems at all</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is cheap- you get what you pay for. Mine went out in a few months due to loose connections. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Not as quiet as my old one but works well</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for about 2 months now..and I still love it!  It&#x27;s quieter than the last one I had, and I love the many settings you can choose.  I don&#x27;t get dry hair in 10 minutes as others report, but it might be due to the porosity of my hair, since I love to color it.  But that&#x27;s okay, it dries WAY faster than the other one I threw out...and I appreciate being to put it on lower heat if need be to be heat-gentle on the hair!</li>
    <li> This hair drier does dry hair pretty fast.  It has a focused jet of air that does not get very hot.  It works well on both my short hair and my wife&#x27;s long, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This drier looks nice with silver and black being so much better than the ridiculous pink and purple colors used on some other models.  The noise is reasonable, and you can always use the low setting if you want to make it quieter.  The unit is light and has a 6 foot long cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the \\&quot;on\\&quot; rocker switch is the bottom switch when you would expect it to be on top.  I think the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; thing is just a marketing gimmick, but it does not hurt to have it.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife and she loved it. it got mw lucky .0)</li>
    <li> I have extremely naturally curly hair and the diffuser is wonderful!  It dries my hair in about 10 minutes instead of waiting half the day for it to air dry.  The best part is it doesn&#x27;t make my hair too frizzy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s relatively quiet, on the low setting. Lightweight and effective. I was skeptical of the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; claim, which does not make scientific sense to me; but for some reason my hair seems to be silkier than it was with my old dryer.</li>
    <li> This is a small lightweight powerful unit.  My wife has long hair and this makes quick work of drying all that hair when needed.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s useful. Good for dry hair, not too strong. The only problem is the concentration is too long for personal use. Sometimes it hits my head.</li>
    <li> I love this drier. I had a Conair one that shorted out that I hadn&#x27;t had for too long. I love this one because it is very lightweight and it dries fast. It was also not very much money. As someone who blow dries everyday I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I got a digital wave recently and I wanted the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the different settings (Hot, Warm, Cold, + Strong, medium, Light).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the different attachments and although it&#x27;s a bit hard to get on/off sometimes, it&#x27;s not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest keeping it on warm, because hot CAN fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a GREAT blowdryer.  Totally worth it$$!</li>
    <li> Again, I was influenced by the over 800 mainly positive reviews for this product. No need to spend a lot of money on a fancy-schmancy hair dryer with a lot of bells and whistles. This hairdryer is super lightweight (great if you have long hair that takes forever to dry and blow out) and comes with diffuser &amp; a concentrator attachments. I&#x27;ve only used this hairdryer for about 2 months, but I have absolutely no complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Great and very powerful hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Despite the noise, the dryer worked perfect at least for me. Considering the price, it worthes. I liked it! Recommend</li>
    <li> Bad very bad&lt;br /&gt;I use it one time then didnot work ... Now what to do ? I am very sad to this happen</li>
    <li> The dryer was great while it worked. It is light to hold. The inclusion of diffuser is great. But it died within six months. I dont want to go to the length of getting a replacement because the process is almost as expensive as the product itself.</li>
    <li> I have long fine hair and can dry my hair in 2-3 minutes.  Lower heat works well for my daughter that has thick long hair because she is sensitive to high heat settings.  Glad to have purchased this model.</li>
    <li> Good hairdryer, not super fast as other have said (I have very thick curly long hair) takes about as long as my old hairdryer - 30 mins to an hour. But for the price I cannot complain, I don&#x27;t dry my hair often with a hairdryer, so its a good little thing to have for emergencies (or really cold days) I wouldn&#x27;t consider paying any more for something I don&#x27;t use very often. I think if you dry your hair every other day, maybe spend a bit more money.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the blowdryer as I can blow my hair straight or use the diffuser to curl it up.</li>
    <li> Cannot say enough positive things about this hair dryer! Lightweight, noise level relatively quiet, just overall it far exceeds any expectations I had. Price very reasonable especially for such a great hair dryer.  I have thick shoulder length hair  with this dryer my hair is so much more managable and even better: have received tons of compliments on my hair!!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> bought this for the master bath but we often have company and after using it once they seem to remember it when they come back. lots of power and easy to listen and talk while using it.</li>
    <li> This is good size working dryer. The power works just fine, seems durable and does its job. I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I absolutely find the giant cab unnecessary.</li>
    <li> In good condition and easy for curly hair. I bought that for myself and I curl my hair like two weeks ago, it works really good.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold and not too heavy.  It does seem to work much faster than my previous hair dryer.  Buttons are easy to work.  Wish it had a longer cord.</li>
    <li> My niece requested to get hair products for herself so just bought this with a curling iron.  She&#x27;s already a preteen and she has two sisters so now she has her own beauty items.  No complaints from her and so she&#x27;s satisfied!  These hair dryers work well and never disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for shipping it out in time before Christmas especially since I lagged in ordering Christmas gifts late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package and item all new and in great condition.</li>
    <li> i love it, it´s beautifuul and mi favorite, i´m going to buy une for mi mother in law, she love it too, thanks for all</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer! It does not make hair frizzy! It had all the accessories you need for any style!</li>
    <li> Product works as it should but is a bit hefty for my dinimutive size and shoulder challenges. Works great, however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence with this hair dryer. For the price, it&#x27;s pretty fricken amazing but it feels big and awkward to hold up in the air for the time it takes to dry my massive head of thick hair. It could also just be that I&#x27;m used to smaller, travel size hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very frustrated with the type of switches and placement because my fingers keep hitting the off button... So I can&#x27;t even hold it by the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the multiple speeds and tempratures. Cool shot button is cool... haha! I just read that out loud. The included attachments are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, for the price, I can&#x27;t complain. I think I&#x27;ll keep it because I can&#x27;t find any other dryer, with all the features, for a better deal.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a hair dryer, no problems at all. Light weight and works. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned!  You CANNOT beat the price, I have seen other tourmaline dryers for hundreds of dollars.  The variety of settings gives you whatever drying you need and it is so powerful, it dries my hair in no time flat but without blowing me across the room.  I am always amazed that my hair is dry so fast and without being frizzy, a problem I had with my other dryers.  I use the concentrator.  I thought, I really didn&#x27;t need to spend money on another hair dryer, how much different can it be?  SO Love it!  Glad I took the chance to try it!</li>
    <li> The dryer is just what I ordered and it works just like it said it would.My wife loves it and it does just what it says.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer back in April of 2012. I set it aside until the dryer I was using at that time began to lose blowing power. That is the most important factor to me. With that, I was a tad disappointed in this dryer because from the onset it did not have the power that I like in a dryer. At this point it is even more sluggish. I am shopping for a new hair dryer, not a Revlon. It did the job, dried my hair but it was no better than OK.....</li>
    <li> I am a cheapskate so of course I bought the cheapest blow dryer with the best ratings on amazon. I just wanted to add my vote that this is an excellent hair dryer. It is powerful and dries my hair very quickly. It has a warm/cool and high/low setting so it seems like it would be good for any type of hair.</li>
    <li> Needed a new blowdryer and this one is uncomplicated and light weight and just works great. It&#x27;s my second one...bought one for both bathrooms.</li>
    <li> I have fine long hair that easily frizzes.  This dried my hair fast and a bit less frizz than other dryers that I have used.</li>
    <li> Yet another Christmas present for my daughter! She didn&#x27;t want a hair dryer because it takes too long at her Mother&#x27;s house and she gets aggravated. She LOVES this one. It dries her hair much faster, and without sounding like a Boeing 747 (not to be considered an endorsement for Boeing) ready for takeoff. It was a great value, and my daughter actually uses it which tells the story.</li>
    <li> This is a powerful dryer, but it doesn&#x27;t singe my hair the way most do.  I&#x27;m used to a smaller dryer, so the heft took a little getting used to, but my small ones never felt like a salon dryer the way this one does.  My one caveat is if you have a specific storage space, be sure to pay attention to the measurements.  I didn&#x27;t, but I lucked out.  It stays in a drawer in my vanity that has an electrical outlet built in, and it fits in there with no room to spare.  If it&#x27;s even lying on a hairpin or its own cord, the drawer won&#x27;t shut. So, I&#x27;m glad I bought it, and I expect we&#x27;ll have a long and beautiful relationship.</li>
    <li> We needed a new dryer as our old one of 10 plus years stopped working. Based on other reviews, I purchased this dryer. It is fairly light and comfortable to use. The low and high speeds seem adequate but my wife feels that our old dryer had a stronger high speed. The heat settings also seem adequate. I use low and warm but my wife uses the high speed and the hot setting. I don&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; when I dry my hair. I don&#x27;t find this dryer to be as quiet as I hoped for although it is somewhat quieter than my old dryer. I have heard other dryers that only seem to produce the sound of air while this dryer produces a slight whine at the low speed and a louder whine at the high speed. All in all, it does the job for which it is intended. I hope we get as many years out of this one as we did our old one.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.I was very diligent keeping the air intake free of dust which will kill a dryer and I will do the same with this one.This is an important step in the longevity of the dryer.</li>
    <li> I got this when it was 50% off and I can&#x27;t be happier. This in combination with the Vidal Sassoon hair brush has made my hair silkier and softer than it has ever been before. It is really light but powerful. I have fine thin hair so I was a bit nervous at first but it works great as long as I don&#x27;t use the hot setting. The warm works perfectly on my fine hair, drying it for the most part in a commercial break.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a powerful, lightweight, quiet dryer and this is great.  I was worried about my hearing with my old dryer.  I love that it has high/low temp and high/low speed with a nice cool shot button.  Attachments are great and I have no complaints other than that I sometimes accidentally change the settings when I am drying my hair b/c of the placement of the switches.</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair that would take 25-35 min with a difuser. Now with this dryer 5 MINUTES!wonderful dryer!!!!</li>
    <li> Hair dryer works good. Thant said, the design of the handle could use some improvement. It has a narrow handle. Periodically, I accidentally turn off the hair dryer because my finger accidentally squeezes the small toggle on-off switch on the handle. It is a little annoying, but tolerable</li>
    <li> Great Hair Dryer.    Issues with the location of the on/off switch but willing to deal with that because for the price its an awsome dryer. Does what the manufactor says it does. I don&#x27;t get the finger attachment, but as a defusior it works great. Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> The product box shows a plastic attachment called a concentrator. That part does not come with the product. I tried to get that part shipped but had no luck. Amazon is not the seller so they can only accept a return. Tried the manufacturer but they will not ship it (they said that they do not have the product which makes no sense).  I also tried Amazon feedback and asked for them to remove the box picture since it is misleading - the response was that there is no merit to my comment. Feels like a catch 22 and I am trying to help them. Amazon definitely lost quality with the introduction of other sellers. They are making money but are driving me to other options.</li>
    <li> this dryer says it&#x27;s is less noisier than most other dryers. infact it is Much Louder than my 8yr old dryer. Sounds like the bushings are shot. Drys fine but too noisy.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair in a wash and wear style, but wanted a dryer that would help me leave the house for meetings or church without looking and feeling damp. This one does the job beautifully. The diffuser affixes firmly to the nozzle and the diffuser nubs are large and long enough to keep the warm air the perfect distance from my curls. I can dry my roots gently without disturbing my set or creating frizz. A great dryer for the money. The attachment to concentrate hot air also works well when I want to blow my hair straight.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer drys really well.  It has plenty of power to dry hair. It comes with a diffuser which is a bonus at this price point. The only con was that the buttons could be on the side.</li>
    <li> I also have a professional BaByliss Turbo hair dryer ($200).  I bought this Revlon model because I wanted a lightweight spare for travelling.  I&#x27;ve compared the two on a very thick head of hair.    The BaByliss is quieter, hotter, and blows with more velocity. It comes with a nice long cord. It dried a full head of long hair in 5 minutes.    This Revlon model is quieter than a generic Conair dryer, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s super quiet. It get&#x27;s hot enough, and has adequate velocity.  It is definitely lightweight.    Nonetheless, the Revlon dried the same head of hair in 6 minutes, with similar \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; results.    Overall, hey - you get what you pay for. But, for $25 this hair dryer is an excellent value.  It does the job very well.  I&#x27;m going to buy another one for a gift. I&#x27;m fairly impressed with it (given the low cost).</li>
    <li> My oldest daughter -- who&#x27;s pretty sure she knows everything -- thought I was nuts for buying my wife a hairdryer on Amazon.  \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you just get one at WalMart?\\&quot;, she asked.  Well, my wife loves it.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s so special about it... but I saw all the great reviews and went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean she really really loves it.  She says it&#x27;s the best hairdryer she&#x27;s ever had.  How can one be different from another?  I don&#x27;t know.  What is a creamic ionic whatever?  Who knows?  Who cares!  The reviews said it was great, and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TAKE THAT teenager who always has something to say!  (just kidding... kind of)</li>
    <li> This is the same model I bought last time. The old one last for years. I expect this one will last too. Its hot is hot enough; its high gives strong blow. For the price I pay, I won&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Super simple but very well made and works fantastic! It really does dry hair faster and makes hair very soft afterward. It&#x27;s been two years and this hair dryer is still going strong. I&#x27;m super happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> it shipped fast, and was as promised.  i love that it&#x27;s lightweight and can dry my thick, curly, long hair in about 10 mins (which is about 20 mins faster than my last blow dryer) without causing frizzies (when using the diffuser, which was included, along with a concentrator) or my arms needing a break.  the only time i&#x27;ve had my hair dried faster was at Gene Juarez with what i&#x27;m assuming is much more expensive equipment.  for under $30 i can live with the toggle buttons where they are.  i turned it off once by accident, and just repositioned my hand after that and it was not an issue.</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer, especially for the price.  Very lightweight and dries hair quickly.  The only negative is the placement of the buttons because it is quite easy to turn it off accidentally while drying.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it would make a difference-I was wrong!  This dryer works alot faster than my old \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; (cheap) hairdryer.  Would definately reccommend, great value for the price!</li>
    <li> Not sure I can tell a difference strictly due to the Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer or the products I&#x27;m using, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hair dryer!! The low heat and blow settings are great for my fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> My hair dryer gave out today. i bought it in February of this year, so that&#x27;s 4 1/2 months old.  It&#x27;s totally dead for no reason.  No lint in fan either.  Amazon won&#x27;t accept returns on it anymore.  I am really disappointed as it was a great hair dryer !!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel or staying over family&#x27;s place. Not too big or small. It is just the right size. I blow dry my hair in a jiffy. After this item all you need is the right brush to go with it.</li>
    <li> Totally worth it. Great blow dryer that does what it&#x27;s supposed to. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Had this hair dryer for less than 6 months and it worked fine until it exploded in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s definitely unsafe and not worth it.</li>
    <li> It is less then a year old and it does not work anymore. I wont buy this one again.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is light and quiet. The attachments help you get the desired look. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the item. It is very nice and it came very well packed. I will recommend you. The item is just right what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Loving this blow dryer so far. Dries my hair super fast and leaves it feeling smooth. The attachments are great too. The dryer is very lightweight, which I love because my last one was heavy. Only issue so far is that my fingers hit the cooling button sometimes while drying my hair.</li>
    <li> So great for its price. Definitely comparable to higher end dryers. Plus, it is super light weight which is a plus to me. My upper arm fatigues easily, and I have thick hair, which is a recipe for disaster with most dryers. This one is a great! I dry my hair quickly, and my arm does not tire half way through.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now gone through two of these hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good: Man, this thing dries my hair, and FAST. And the price can&#x27;t be beat. That&#x27;s why I bought it a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad: The first one I had melted the concentrator after about a year. The second one didn&#x27;t - I stopped leaving it attached to the dryer after I used it. However, what both dryers did that I can&#x27;t forgive is SPARK and develop scary lawnmower sounds after about a year of use. I can use them both on the low setting (which is too low to actually accomplish anything), but the moment I press the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; switch, it sounds like there&#x27;s a chainsaw in my hair (which, frankly, is the last thing I want by my head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Invest in a more expensive dryer, or risk setting your head on fire.</li>
    <li> The cord in the handle shorted out in less than 6 months.</li>
    <li> This dryer smooths my hair so well - I&#x27;ve never used a dryer like this before.  It is a little bit on the heavy side, but I&#x27;ll take it because of the results I get.  Great job for a minimal price.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works really fast.  It usually takes me 10 minutes to dry my hair in the morning and also get the straight sleek look, the hair dryer has cut that time in half.</li>
    <li> Without any warning and without first shorting out like it should have, our Revlon RV544PKF spewed sparks out at my wife, burning her hand. After we carefully unplugged it, smoke kept pouring out of it. This is completely unacceptable from a product that we have been using for just over 18 months. I hope you can do something to replace this defective hairdryer! And yes, I am meticulous in making sure there is no buildup in the hairdryer that would have contributed to this. We are lucky she wasn&#x27;t seriously electrocuted!  UPDATE: We contacted Revlon customer service who handled this very well. They sent us a shipping label to send the hairdryer back, and are shipping us an upgraded professional level hairdryer as a replacement, free of charge. +1 star for standing behind their product, but I still wouldn&#x27;t buy this product itself again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t decide if my hair dresser gave me a great cut this last time or it&#x27;s the hair dryer, but I have been having a lot more good hair days than bad.  The dryer is nice and light, easy to use.  Love that it included two attachments.  So far so good and the price is great for the product.</li>
    <li> Loved the dryer, but same as the past reviewer, the cord has a short and it stopped working. Bought in March - lasted 3 months.    Update:  I contacted Revlon and they sent me a free replacement.    Update 12/15/2014:  The replacement still has the same issue with the short in the cord.  My last one started smoking.  I would NOT recommend this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> It dries my hair very fast! I don&#x27;t see a huge different in reducing frizz in my hair. It&#x27;s mainly nice that it&#x27;s very strong-powered and not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Caught on fire and sparked, thankfully it did not burn my arm</li>
    <li> Ordered on Monday received on Friday awesome. Love this product and it was a great value</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace an old inexpensive Conair that was starting to overheat on me every time I dried to dry my hair. I was originally looking to buy a more expensive dryer, thinking that is what I needed this time around to avoid having it crap out on me. I was prepared to spend a lot more money, but saw many reviews for this one saying that it worked pretty much just as well as some of the expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been quite happy with it. It is powerful enough to dry my shoulder length hair fairly quickly. I think it has been better than my old dryer at taming flyways, but it could also be the better shampoo I started using.  I use the dryer often on high heat, full power to dry my hair all over. I also make liberal use of the small directional attachment to concentrate the air on my brush as I am brushing it out. I like the low power, heat option for this to make sure I&#x27;m not blowing my hair around too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really \\&quot;good\\&quot; at doing my hair or have a lot of demands for a hair dryer. I have naturally straight hair that doesn&#x27;t need a lot of work. So, considering that, I&#x27;ve been very content with this dryer and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Pros: very light weight, quiet, gets very hot (i use on &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; after using &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; and getting a burning hair smell), soft hair (after drying with my 10 year old conair my hair felt like straw, not with this hairdryer), smooth handle (can wipe clean if you get product on it, unlike tacky handles), nozzles stays on (my old hair dyer attachments would fall off if you slightly bumped them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: didn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster than my 10 year old conair, if it breaks it was inexpensive and I can buy another one in a year and not feel guilty.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this thing!</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Very light weight.  Works good.  Took on vacation, my niece borrowed and then made her mom buy one for her, she said mine did a better job than theirs that cost over $100.</li>
    <li> Date Purchased/Length of Ownership: Dec 2012 - Mar 2017 (4 yrs 4 months)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;| Pros |&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- Dries hair faster than a non-tourmaline/non-ceramic dryer&lt;br /&gt;- Light (562 g / 1.24 lb / 19.8 oz)&lt;br /&gt;- Cool shot feature&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t leave fine hair frizzy&lt;br /&gt;- Concentrator attachment works well w/a round brush&lt;br /&gt;- Concentrator attachment clips on securely (&amp; doesn&#x27;t fly off during use)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;| Cons |&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- Performance has been spotty 1-2x (in the entire 2+ yrs I&#x27;ve owned it).  It felt like only some of the coils were heating up, as the air wasn&#x27;t as hot as usual.  Still dried my hair though, just took a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;- Nowhere to buy separate attachments if you lose the ones that come with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;Notes/Tips&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;- This full-sized one works so well I bought the folding travel version ([[ASIN:B001AFGLI4 Revlon RVDR5001]])&lt;br /&gt;- Dryer finally kicked the bucket Mar 2017.  The the cord is finally worn out thanks to a loose wire; it only works when the cord is angled a particular way relative to the dryer.</li>
    <li> I use this with the diffuser attachment to dry my curly hair. It is powerful enough that it forms gentle curls and leaves my hair feeling soft with a good amount of volume. On the highest heat setting it dries fairly quickly and the controls are easy to use. The only thing I would want to change is the length of the cord, it&#x27;s on the short side for me. It works well with the diffuser attachment which is the main reason I bought this dryer, but it is not powerful for me to use for blow drying my hair straight.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this hair dryer.  The only complaint I have is that the attachments that came with it did not fit.  It doesn&#x27;t matter much to me, it still dries my hair but it was a little strange.</li>
    <li> Really good value for money!</li>
    <li> Works fast and the attachments are very secure. Sometimes a little tough to remove, but I&#x27;ll take that over them randomly falling off, like the brand I replaced with this one.</li>
    <li> Gets my hair very dry!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair really shiny and dries it in no time.  I have only had it for a few weeks though.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer, it&#x27;s inexpensive and works great. My only issue is I&#x27;m on my 4th I think. They conk out after about a year and I do not use it every day, maybe 4 times a week. I like it enough to keep replacing the broken ones but keep in mind it might break on you mid blow out.</li>
    <li> I love this handy hair dryer.  Works well with all types of hair and is dual voltage. Overall a wise choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many different hair dryers and this one is average. I will say that it is fast to dry my hair compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past, and I like that it has high and low speed options. Nothing spectacular though. Good for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the fastest personal, non-professional, dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  However, my box did not have the two attachments in the photo in the box.  This seems to be uncommon.  I give the hair dryer alone 5 stars, but since I was missing 2 things, I took 2 stars off.</li>
    <li> This dryer is amazing!  Dries my hair quickly and does not burn my scalp or ears....great settings and recommend highly!!</li>
    <li> Quality of this item is good, I ordered two for use by my family.  They were shipped and received on time.  Would buy it again...</li>
    <li> super lightweight, worked great for 2 years then just puttered out, stopped heating the air. but for the price that seems not totally unreasonable, i got 2 solid years of daily use out of it. the heat does melt the concentrator.</li>
    <li> It was a crisp sunny day. It was one of those rare warm pre-spring days when everyone is taking their dogs on their (once) annual walks.  Naturally, dog owners need a beer to quench their post-walk thirst.  I am no different.  So we saunter into a down bar.  Initially we are greeted with the statement that dogs are not allowed.  Alas, I am prepared for this.  Using my cleverly counterfeited dog assistant card, I convince the manager to either let Mr. Beagle in or let me call the Department of Justice.  Said manager relented, and my dog was given leave to wander the watering hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we wander about the watering hole, a particular waitress and Mr. Beagle hit it off.  I waited for him to get done and then cleaned up the scraps.  We agreed to go watch movies at my place.  I was particularly proud of my new theater room with the new sofa in it.  Looks pretty dang nice.  We watched approximately 8 minutes of a nature documentary before I tried to get to fifth or sixth base.  Everything is going fine.  Then BAMMMMMMMMMMMM.  This crazy chick asks me to pour wax on her.  it gets all over the sofa and the carpet.  WTF am I gonna do?  For at least a month, the answer was nothing.  Then I ordered this freaking hair dryer and it melted the wax.  Now I have a good looking couch again.  Thanks, hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I never actually dried hair this with. I would not recommend it for that.  This device is clearly designed for wax melting.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer for a great price. Love all the attachments. Great way for everyone in the family to use</li>
    <li> I love both of the attachments. You can&#x27;t beat the price. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase! Dries quickly. The diffuser is great for curly hair</li>
    <li> Today, this very dangerous hair dryer, sparked and immedialy caught on fire.  I purchased this dryer in September.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This dryer is lightweight and dries my thick hair quickly. I have used Revlon products in the past and this one hasn&#x27;t disappointed me.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I hated blowdrying my hair because my old hair dryer took so long to do any real work. I purchased this one, and LOVE IT. Very efficient, very good at drying. The attachments stick a little, but I&#x27;d rather have them stick than fall off. Not as noisy as my old dryer, and I don&#x27;t feel hot and sweaty anymore after FINALLY getting all of my hair dry.</li>
    <li> My blow dryer broke while I was getting ready for work. Thanks to Amazon Prime I had a reasonably priced replacement in my hands the next day! This blow dryer works very well.</li>
    <li> I used this hairdryer while on vacation and had to buy one for my own. I have short straight hair, and I love that you can dry on low and warm, and still not take forever. My hair seems so soft and not dried out. Its easy to handle and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> This dryer is great. It dries my hair really fast, and it&#x27;s not too heavy. It&#x27;s also a great price.</li>
    <li> Good quality,no problems,useful and quite sturdy</li>
    <li> I really like this blow dryer. It&#x27;s so light. And it dries pretty fast. The buttons don&#x27;t get in the way. I&#x27;m really pleased. I would recommend it to my friends if they were in the market.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for 8 years now and I think it&#x27;s just starting to wear out because it&#x27;s making a noise and getting too hot.  I have thick hair and it has done a really great job drying.  The reason I gave it 3 stars is after about 3 years,the silver finish started flaking off so it looks really lousy now.  I am going to replace it with one that has molded plastic and no \\&quot;special\\&quot; finishes on it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a diffuser for my curly hair.  The one on this dryer is nice and large. There are separate controls for heat and the fan which together with the cold(no heat button) makes it easier to control the heat. The dryer is light which&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to know how the &amp;#34;ion&amp;#34; technology works but there were no details, either in the box or the website. Looking in the dryer shows the usual coiled elements. Disappointing but not a deal breaker.</li>
    <li> Just like all the other happy reviewers have said, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> I am a HUGE fan of Amazon.com - but I guess I should have read the fine print a little more carefully before purchasing this product.  I barely had it for 3 months, and couldn&#x27;t have used it more than 5 or 6 times.  The other day when I picked it up to start blow drying my hair, something popped inside and that was that.  This is REALLY aggravating - and what&#x27;s more - I can&#x27;t return or exchange it.  I foolishly assumed that I would have this item for at least a year before it needed replacing so I threw away the box as soon as I received it.  Hopefully I can dig up the warranty on it so that I can return it to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s $20 that I just threw in the trash.  You get what you pay for, I guess!  Anyone out there have any recommends of a good hair dryer?  I will consider this a lesson learned the annoying way and accept the fact that I&#x27;ll have to splurge a bit on the next hairdryer purchase.</li>
    <li> Heats fine, but the blower is less than the compact, cord-reeling Conair this replaced.  Hair dried is very much like air-dried, just quick</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Replacement we were sent gave up the ghost as well.  Wife never dropped it and was always careful.  She started drying her hair, turned off the dryer and set it down for a few minutes and when she came back it was done. Just a poor build..  Do yourself a favor and find something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Began having issues in the first 6 months.  Power would randomly cut in and out while drying hair.  Finally got a hold of Revlon who forwarded my email to their subsidiary who actually produces/sells these hair dryers.  They were very kind and sent us a new unit, similar, but not the same, maybe better, time will tell.  They also provided a return label so that they could take a look at the broken unit.  Not the best quality product, but great customer services.</li>
    <li> Blow dryer is powerful, and works well, but the attachments are almost impossible to attach on the end if the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> There is not much to say... you have 2 levels of heat, two level of power, and a cold air feature. It is nice and powerful, and comes with some accessories. Just what you would expect for the money.</li>
    <li> I am no hair dryer maven, but I wanted one with temperature and power settings, and this one meet those quals. We&#x27;ve had this dryer for two weeks now and it works very well. One of the additional pieces is a little hard to get on, but we don&#x27;t really use those things anyway.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair dryer I have ever bought, and as it dries my hair in a reasonable amount of time and has not broken, shocked me, or burnt me, I declare it a success. Huzzah!</li>
    <li> I needed a dryer just to keep at our cabin, so I wanted something cheaper that still worked well. I had decent luck with a Revlon dryer before so I went with this model. This is cheap, but does not work well at all. The power cord gets hotter than the dryer. It is surprisingly loud, even for a hair dryer. It takes at least 3 times the amount of time to dry my hair compared to my Rusk dryer, and twice as longer than an older Revlon dryer I have as a spare. Until a few days ago, I had almost waist length hair. I do understand that longer hair takes longer to dry, but this took 30 minutes and I gave up before completely dry. My arm hurt. What really chaps my pants is that I paid almost $30 for this at Ulta. Unfortunately, the exchange period closed before I got to the cabin to use this, so I am stuck with it. If I didn&#x27;t cut my hair to shoulder length recently, I would probably just throw this away and spend the extra money on another Rusk.</li>
    <li> I love this little machine. It&#x27;s lightweight, powerful and easy to handle. I have waist-length hair and it only takes about 10 minutes to get it dry enough to call it done.</li>
    <li> Well, it was great for about 6 weeks.... then it stopped working this morning. I checked the breaker (nope), reset the plug (nope), checked the outlet to make sure it was working (yep). And... because the Amazon \\&quot;1 month return policy\\&quot; has passed, I can&#x27;t even return it! Complete waste of money! DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
    <li> looks good.. works good.. price is good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s lightweight but still has enough power to be effective.  The hot is really hot and works good for my thick hair.  The only suggestion I have for an improvement is that the buttons are right where you hold the blow dryer and it is easy to inadvertently change the settings.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday, and it works well for both me and my little one.  Great deal, and it arrived at my doorstep in less than 24 hours!</li>
    <li> It works  grat, everything that I expected</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer one year ago and it already has a short in the wiring. If the dryer isn&#x27;t held in a particular position, it cuts out.</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer for an excellent price!</li>
    <li> This was a great dryer while it lasted. The cord, however, was not made well and after only around a year of use, split near the dryer base and shot sparks around my bedroom. I will be sending photos to Revlon. Not a safe product.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY POOR ..</li>
    <li> This is not as strong as my friend&#x27;s who has the same exact hair dryer.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> It does get a bit too hot even for hair dryer standards, but no accidents have happened yet, so I am putting my trust on this.</li>
    <li> I hate this hair dryer. It claims to dry hair fast...but my cheap Conair 1875 hair dyer does a way better job. I have a lot if hair, it&#x27;s not super thick but I still have thick hair. I was looking for a hair dryer with different temperature settings, since my old Conair hair dryer only has High, Low, Off and a cool shot button. And after reading the reviews I decided on this one....big mistake. I wish I kept the box, would have sent it back. It took longer to dry my hair, I want power! I want low heat but high blowing power....so that my hair dries fast. This does not do the job. So I bought another Conair 1875 dryer but this one now has low &amp; high temp settings that I was looking for. It has the power too. This Revlon one just sucks IMO.</li>
    <li> I used this hair dryer a few times and it was ok. I thought the warm setting was a little too hot, but I dealt with it. One day, I flipped my hair over to dry the underneath. I should not have done this, but as I was drying my hair near my face, my hair was sucked into the back vent. I immediately shut the dryer off. I had to rip my hair out of the back vent. Even though you shouldn&#x27;t dry your hair underneath near your face, this hair dryer&#x27;s screen needs to be redesigned so this doesn&#x27;t happen in the future. This has never happened to me with any other hair dryer before, even when I dry my hair the exact same way.</li>
    <li> Get product. Only wish it came with a comb instead of the big thing.</li>
    <li> It works fine, just too big in its size, will be perfect if it can be folded..</li>
    <li> Broke. I had this for less than 6 months and it keeps shorting out. I&#x27;ve had plenty of inexpensive hair dryers that have lasted YEARS, not just a few months. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; stopped working after a few uses.  Otherwise a nice inexpensive hair dryer for my kids.</li>
    <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;-Light weight&lt;br /&gt;-Quiet&lt;br /&gt;-Fast drying time&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;-Nothing yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended?&lt;br /&gt;Yes. I only bought this due to a great Cyber Monday deal and it has replaced my current one as the daily driver. I thought all blow dryers were the same but this one is by far the best one I&#x27;ve used. But keep in mind that I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist. I&#x27;m sure there are better ones out there, but I&#x27;m confident that it can&#x27;t match this one when you factor in the cost.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for about a month now. It works wonderfully!!! Much better than my old one (that got accidently shipped to New York!). It is lightweight, powerfull and drys very well. I am one happy camper!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair dryer. It&#x27;s fast and the lightest dryer I&#x27;ve ever handled. It comes with 2 attachments and a very good price versus what you&#x27;ll pay at Target or Walmart. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Thank you everyone for writing all these detailed reviews. My CHI hair dryer stopped working last week and i didn&#x27;t want to spend another $150 on one so i read all these amazing reviews and finally got the Revlon RV544. I absolutely love it. It is super light-weighted in comparison with all the ones i previously owned and it is super strong. I have a brazilian blowout done in my hair so i need to blow dry it every day after showering but my hair is so flat that i don&#x27;t need to do that much. After using this Revlon dryer my drying time was cut in half. It honestly takes me 10 minutes to have it ready to go out out and i have a lot of hair and super long.  If all the great reviews are not enough to get it at least for $20 you need to try it!</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these and they both broke within months of receiving them.  I had a Revlon hair dryer that lasted about 10 years so I thought when the first one broke it was just an anomaly.  Apparently not because the second one did the exact same thing. I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> What a great hair dryer!  Have had to buy several over the years because the wife keeps taking it to the beach on her women&#x27;s beach week.  I try to hide mine but when she eventually needs a new one guess whose she takes.</li>
    <li> This is definitely worth the price.  It is the lightest weight dryer I have ever handled and it does dry my hair quicker.  Not sure why anyone would want the heat to get hotter than it does, it works just fine on the high setting.  I don&#x27;t know how long this is going to last, but even if it is just for a year, it was worth it. What do you expect for $17?</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is perfectly fine for regular use.  Fairly quiet, dries quickly, and I can definitely notice my hair is shinier than when I used my previous dryer. The only negative is that the way I hold the dryer, I accidentally push a button almost every time I dry my hair. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Powerful and quiet compared to others. It leaves hair without frizz which I love.</li>
    <li> I like this blow dryer.  I was looking for one that was affordable yet good quality and I think this is it.  Other reviewers were concerned about the location of the buttons but all other blow dryers I had previously had buttons in the same spot.  The only reason they might have had trouble is that the buttons press easily, so maybe the previous reviewers move their fingers around a bit while drying?  I don&#x27;t have any issue with the buttons.  Also, I held the diffuser up to my 4 year old son&#x27;s hair and told him aliens were drying his hair and he thought that was super funny...</li>
    <li> Just ordered this hairdryer last week after my old one broke. I so far used it once and it worked perfect and best of all it&#x27;s pretty cheap. It is a light weight, doesn&#x27;t have a loud noise like my old one. I have a long, thick and straight hair so I do often need to dry it. I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Wow, I bought this about 2-3 weeks ago and opened the package.  Around the 2nd time of using, there was a weird burning smell.  I thought I could just restart it and the smell would go away.  I restarted it 5 TIMES.  Smell?  Still there.  I stopped using it.  The burning smell is so strong and spread to the rest of my rooms.    And I can&#x27;t return it now.    WTF.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Before this purchase I used some cheap blowdryer I had that survived over the years and it made my hair into a lion. I bought this one b/c of the good reviews. It actually is really good! My hair after using this dryer is very soft and not frizzy at all</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Packaged well, it arrived in super-quick time and is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical person and I confess that I&#x27;m not really good doing my hair by myself. But with this hairdryer I am simply amazed, all the best! Honestly I did my hair couple times last week and I was amazed with the results, then I did my hair couple more times  before posting my review, and I can tell now that is great. Excellent buy for the price!</li>
    <li> My wife had picked this out. Shipping came quickly and she absolutely loves the unit. She has really thick hair, so I guess it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I like the Revlon Tourmaline a lot, but the diffuser comes off way too easily and falls into the floor as I am working on the back of my head with it. My sister who gave it to me things it&#x27;s just a defective set of diffuser tabs and they do look a little frayed even though I&#x27;ve only had it a short while and it&#x27;s always done this. I am going to see if Revlon will replace it. I&#x27;ll post a follow-up after I find out what they say.</li>
    <li> Works great and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I bought my first RV544 after a \\&quot;blow-dry 101\\&quot; class with my stylist. Noted features: 1) ionic, 2) tourmaline, 3) concentrator attachment that has a narrow opening. DO NOT get rid of your concentrator attachment when you buy a new blow dryer! I have very straight, flat hair so a diffuser is useless for me, but the concentrator is essential. It builds body and volume.  Some dryers have a funneling \\&quot;concentrator\\&quot; that is so fat it could hardly be concentrating anything. Look for a slim opening. This dryer has it.    Another favorite feature: it&#x27;s VERY lightweight. I style my hair from start to finish with my blow dryer, no curling/straightening tools, just the dryer and 2 brushes. Technique is important. I have a great stylist who taught me this. Anyway the light weight is great both for use and for travel.     And, the attachments snap on and pivot easily in a groove on the end of the blower. This is important because a dryer that has a concentrator that just fits over the end but doesn&#x27;t snap in place will make you FURIOUS. I am talking about the concentrator either blowing off mid-process, or being so tight that you can&#x27;t get it off nor can you pivot it. I have carpal tunnel syndrome and it is very painful to try to adjust the concentrator. This one is so very easy.    I have owned 2 of these dryers and I&#x27;m ready to purchase my 3rd. One of my daughters took over #1, someone burned a hole in the concentrator of #2, and to replace it I bought an expensive salon dryer thinking price meant value. That&#x27;s the one that has been driving me nuts. I&#x27;m going to retire the pricey dryer to the \\&quot;emergency\\&quot; drawer and buy this one again.

    <li> I prefer to dry my hair on the low setting and was disappointed to find that the low setting on this model wasn&#x27;t low.  Even with the diffuser it just didn&#x27;t suit my needs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently on my second one of these. It&#x27;s a great, powerful hair dryer, and I&#x27;ll probably keep buying one when this one eventually fails!     I had my first one for about a year, when it suddenly decided only to work when the business end was pointed down. Which, okay, I can work with, but I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one to replace it. It&#x27;s powerful, not too loud, not too heavy or unwieldy, and it actually gets hot. Some other reviewers feel that it gets too hot, but I think it&#x27;s just right, though it was certainly a change to use a new, more powerful dryer after using a practical but underpowered foldable model for years. The attachments are great, and I got a little tutorial from the amazing lady who cuts my hair on how to use the diffuser attachment, which was super helpful.     This is definitely a bang-for-your-buck sort of product -- maybe it&#x27;s not the flashiest, maybe it won&#x27;t last long enough to be passed down to your grandkids, but in the meantime, it does exactly what you want it to. No bells and whistles here, but it&#x27;s a solid little thing that can really do its job. And you can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
    <li> It dries my hair. Nothing fancy. Basically like air-drying my hair, but with a blow dryer... Doesn&#x27;t smooth out my hair too much or do anything like that, which my old blow dryer did.</li>
    <li> Not heavy, good quality. I usually use the &amp;#34; warm&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; high&amp;#34; setting to blow dry my hair. It drys my hair fast and does less heat damage to my hair :) Worth the price. Not sure about other ways of using it ( styling?). If you are looking for something that can blow dry your hair, this does the job!</li>
    <li> Serves purpose,I have 3 hair driers this is the best</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good but after 18 months the cord broke at the handle and it sparked electricity. Had to trash at that point....</li>
    <li> It has the features which my wife wanted, and is quiet, which is what I wanted. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. It works well. Very functional. So far we have encountered no problems with it. Serves its use well.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer gets the job done. Its ionic feature really gives shine to my hair. I have one in use at home and this one I bought to use as  my travel dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ela, Guam</li>
    <li> Average hair dryer. Nothing great.</li>
    <li> My first one of these died because I dropped one too many times on a tile floor... so sad. I hadn&#x27;t been unhappy with this hair dryer, but I took the opportunity to try another (more expensive) hair dryer, the Jilbere Procelain Series from Sally Beauty, which promises much the same as this one (smoother hair, fast drying time, etc) and has 5 stars with 23 reviews on their website. I thought maybe the extra buck would deliver a little extra bang. Ugh, it was awful! I used exactly the same hair products, brush, etc, and used their concentrator attachment--everything the same except it was a different hair dryer, and it made my hair horribly frizzy (somehow it seemed to make each strand courser and all of my fly-aways poof out), was itself a bit heavier, and it seemed to take even longer to get my hair dry. As soon as I got back home from returning that one, I hopped on amazon.com to order another one of these!!! It&#x27;s half the price of the other one I bought, and so much quieter, faster, and really smoothed my hair!  Ahhh... SO much better!</li>
    <li> I love that this dryer is so lightweight, but still packs so much power! Most dryers I&#x27;ve tried in the past blow too much air that isn&#x27;t hot enough, but this one gets hot enough so that my hair dries quickly with the least amount of frizz. I too off one star because they don&#x27;t tend to last very long, but for the price it&#x27;s still a pretty good purchase!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s been using this for 3 or 4 years now and she still loves it</li>
    <li> My first blow dryer, so I have nothing to compare to. But this product came with two attachments, I have the diffuser to my sister. But the other I kept, I&#x27;m a guy and I got it so I can manage my wild hair. I have wavy/curly hair but I&#x27;m going for the combover/Pompador style and this thing works great.</li>
    <li> A little bigger than I had expected it to be and the &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; does not get as &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; as I hoped it would get. Otherwise a decent hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Again, the good reviews were right!  It dries my long hair quicker than previous dryers, &amp; it&#x27;s lightweight, so my arms don&#x27;t tire out.  My hair actually does feel soft &amp; silky, salon-quality, after using it, and it&#x27;s much less expensive than other salon-quality dryers.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer worked for awhile (about 1-2 years) and then started making terrible noises. I checked and there is no hair stuck in it. Now I have to buy a new one. It worked great while it lasted, heated well and dried hair quickly, but now  I have to replace it.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this blowdryer. I have been purchasing T3Tourmaline blowdryers at $250 a pop. I have gone thru 3-4 T3 blowdryers. They have all died on me except for one - I dropped it and broke the plastic housing before it could die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my most recent T3 blowdryer suddenly died, I said &amp;#34;that&#x27;s it. I am no longer going to be a fool by shelling out another $250.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair and used this Revlon model for the 1st time this morning. My hair turned out perfect! And keep in mind that this Revlon model is one tenth the cost of a T3! I paid $19.99 for this Revlon model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that is naturally wavy/curly and tends to get frizzy. It is past shoulder length. I straighten it with a 3&amp;#34; T3 barrel brush and a T3 vent brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you: this Revlon blowdryer works just as good as the T3 blowdryers, but costs 10x less. If it dies, I can certainly afford to replace it! In fact, I think I have more volume in my hair than I did when I was using the T3 blowdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Dryer. It just got delivered, so I haven&#x27;t tried it yet…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this Revlon blowdryer!</li>
    <li> I love it! It is light and great power . Hot enough . I used to have one very strong that it used to burn my hair. This one is powerful , dries your hair quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn it. Go for it , the price is great !</li>
    <li> I had overnyt on my aunties house, took a bath there, and used this dryer, i was amazed that my hair dried differently, it was shiny, smoother and doesnt look too dry like my regular dryer. I think its bcoz of the ions. So i purchased this too. Luv it</li>
    <li> The only reason why I bought this hair dryer was because it was the top dryer on Amazon.com. Has anyone actually owned this dryer? I returned it after one use. Absolutely terrible. No, horrific! The power coming out is so low. I mean HONESTLY.......has anyone actually used this?? I have bought many items on amazon and this is my first review because I felt so compelled to say how terrible this product was. I was trapped into the top result through amazon. I can only assume there are thousands who are also duped into buying this ridiculous hair dryer. If you want an amazing brand - try Remington!!!</li>
    <li> Overall pretty happy - it&#x27;s a hairdryer and it works, right? Sometimes find I hit the cold air button by accident. Haven&#x27;t tried the big disc attachment, but the normal one&#x27;s fine. Works well and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like this blow dryer but, I agree with many other reviews in that the power button is located in a poor place and it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally turn the dryer off when drying.</li>
    <li> Ok, that&#x27;s not true. Ions are completely, 100% real. But the real question is whether or not they have magical powers to make your hair soft, silky, and extra shiny. Well, here&#x27;s the answer: It&#x27;s all marketing BS. Seriously, what kind of ions are they? Are they positively charged or negatively charged? The lack of detail offered does not inspire confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But aside from the ions, this device effectively expels hot air. When I turn it on and point it at my hair when it is wet, my hair dries. When I use the air focusing attachment in conjunction with a round brush, my hair is straightened. When I use the diffuser it&#x27;s not straight. But it&#x27;s also not pretty. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m using it wrong or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness however, this hair dryer is perfectly effective. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive hair dryer unless it comes with robotic arms which style your hair for you. This is a heating element and a fan, an incredibly simple device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially when I began my quest for a new hair dryer I was overwhelmed by all the choices, and I began doing research on what makes a hair dryer good. I even made a spreadsheet! I began googling and was told that there are multiple factors which are important: Ions, ceramic heating element, type of motor, and wattage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Ions: I&#x27;ve already discussed these in the beginning of the post. But for further clarification, I&#x27;ll include information from a more reputable source than someone who calls herself \\&quot;CatMonkey\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;How do \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; hair dryers affect the hair, short-term and long term?&lt;br /&gt;  In the short term, the ions produced by an ionic hair dryer help reduce static electricity. Ordinary blow dryers tend to produce  static electricity. Having extra charged particles (ions) in the air allows any built-up electrical charge (static electricity) to be transferred through the air to other nearby surfaces. This doesn&#x27;t have much effect, since the \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; effects of static electricity fade within a few minutes anyway. Coating the hair with gel or some kind of conductive conditioner would have a much stronger and lasting effect than ions, which only exist while the hair dryer is running. In the long term, ions are more reactive than other molecules, so they probably cause the hair and/or natural oils to be oxidized and the hair to become more brittle. But this is probably a smaller effect than the use of conditioners (good) or hot air (bad). More worrisome is that ionic generators generate ozone, which is good high in the atmosphere but bad here at ground level. Ozone contributes to smog and can cause lung irritation.\\&quot; Source: University of California Santa Barbara: Science Line ([...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, long story short: Ions might have some effect, but it&#x27;s negligible compared to a good conditioner, and ionic generators generate ozone. I couldn&#x27;t find a hair dryer without \\&quot;ionic technology\\&quot; but skip the ones with an ionic generator and buy a fancy conditioner instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Ceramic heating element: I had a hard time finding a hair dryer that wasn&#x27;t ceramic. Whether or not this makes it better or worse is unknown to me. Supposedly it helps the hair dryer heat more evenly. I&#x27;m calling BS on this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Type of motor: Supposedly the type of motor makes a difference, whether it&#x27;s AC or DC. For this I asked an electrical engineer if this could possibly make a difference. He was very confused as to why I was asking him such a dumb question because there would be zero impact on it. \\&quot;FFS CatMonkey, it&#x27;s a heating element and a fan. It&#x27;s not complicated. Why are you wasting so much time on this? Don&#x27;t you have an organic chemistry midterm tomorrow? The type of current doesn&#x27;t matter at all.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Wattage: Some websites said that higher wattage meant higher heat, others said that it wasn&#x27;t a valid indicator of heat output as there was significant variation between high wattage dryers and heat output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we&#x27;ve come to the end, I evaluated those four factors and eventually realized that there are really only a few criteria which are important to me. Cord length, included attachments, and weight. This dryer has a nice long cord, two attachments, and it&#x27;s not super heavy. Oh, and it&#x27;s less than $20. Perfect!w we&#x27;ve come to the end, I evaluated those four factors and eventually realized that there are really only a few criteria which are important to me. Cord length, included attachments, and weight. This dryer has a nice long cord, two attachments, and it&#x27;s not super heavy. Oh, and it&#x27;s less than $20. Perfect!</li>
    <li> She loves it and says its dries her hair much faster than her previous dryer.  Two thumbs up! The attachments are an extra bonus!</li>
    <li> I loved this blow dryer for 2 years.  Then it would stop intermittently and after a few days of that, it shot sparks and nearly burned my arm.  Other reviewers have had the same problem with the defect occurring in the very same spot.  I didn&#x27;t even use it daily nor year-round so I can only assume that it&#x27;s a manufacturing defect.  Had I not thrown it to the floor when I saw the first sparks, I would have been injured like another reviewer said happened to his wife.  Considering that I owned a Conair for almost 10 years and a Vidal Sassoon for over 15 years with no such problems, I can no longer recommend this blow dryer and will not purchase another Revlon in the future.</li>
    <li> my wife likes it worth what we paid but not much more</li>
    <li> It was broken with only 4 months. The code was come dawn.</li>
    <li> The diffuser works well. It is great buy for the price. I do not use hair dryers very often. I works well and does not damage the hair like many heat products.</li>
    <li> Has all of the heat and fan settings as well as accessories that I need.  Works great!  Time will tell as far as how long it lasts as I have only had it for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer and I love the diffuser!  It was a great purchase and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> If it was a little lighter and fold-able it would have received 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderfully powerful with great settings and the accessories make it even better.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I think this hair dryer is a great hair dryer for the money. Not very heavy and has good heat and air.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is fairly lightweight. It handles fairly well except that there is not much room on the handle to hold the dryer without accidentally hitting the on/off switch. I suppose it&#x27;s something I will get used to.</li>
    <li> maybe I haven&#x27;t had a new hairdryer in a while, but this one is much quieter than the one it replaced.  Otherwise, it does it&#x27;s job - dries hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 Revlon hair dryers &amp; will not buy another. With both of them, every time I tried to use the diffuser, it would fall off within a few seconds. Therefore, the included accessories are useless!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a quick replacement for my broken (more expensive) blow dryer. This dries my hair faster and with less frizz than my previous dryer. There are not many options; Hot, warm, hi and low and to get cool air you have to press down the cool shot button while you dry your hair. This is an excellent bargain! Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very versatile and quiet dryer. Both my wife and I use it daily. Not sure what the Tourmaline does for the operation but I&#x27;m am pleased with product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had, works great and I love the attachments. even my hairdresser noticed my hair being less frizzy now that I&#x27;ve used the attachment.</li>
    <li> This is the lightest hair dryer that I&#x27;ve used. Now, I don&#x27;t have to bear cramped shoulders just to style my hair. I also had to mention that its nice and quiet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quieter and doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the one that died BUT it&#x27;s totally working perfectly so I think I&#x27;m just getting older whole technology is getting better which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 2 of these, one for my daughter last Christmas and one for myself 2 years ago. This morning mine started to smoke while I was using it. I&#x27;ve seem similar reviews and even incidents of fire. Needless to say I&#x27;m now looking for 2 new hair dryers. &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works very well for me. I have not had a problem with a too forceful air flow nor have I had a problem with the switch. It has turned off once or twice, but no biggy. It is comfortable to use and dries well. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. Didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I actually wish it could blow harder on high.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to buy this product, it was just so cheap! I thought, the more I paid for a hair dryer, the higher the quality, right? And honestly, the hair dryers in my area that are sold cheaply tend to be made cheaply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift for my mother, who needed a new hair dryer that wouldn&#x27;t short circuit in every outlet it was plugged into. It looks a bit small in person. It&#x27;s MUCH lighter than our old dryer, and it can get hot enough. The extra pieces haven&#x27;t been used much, but this product does the job excellently. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Just the right size; not too heavy.  Easy to pick a useful combination of heat/air flow.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know that I buy all the claims made about this hairdryer. My hair doesn&#x27;t really seem any less frizzy after using this one than it has with every other one I&#x27;ve ever used. And maybe it driess my hair a tiny bit faster? Maybe? But it&#x27;s barely noticeable. If you&#x27;re just looking for a decent, cheap hairdryer that comes with a concentrator and diffuser, this is a decent option but if you really want one that reduces frizz and/or dries faster, you&#x27;re going to have to spend more money.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing, my hairdresser loves it!! The low heat setting is better than any other low heat setting I&#x27;ve used and it dries my hair very quickly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for at least a month now. At first I thought a hair dryer is a hair dryer, but it definitely reduces static and fly aways.  I usually have to flat iron my hair, but with this dryer and its dry and go, which saves a ton of time in the morning. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well on even curly hair. and pretty effective for straightening you hair even for long duration. Its a great deal. go for it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month now and so far so good. Not too noisy and has good air flow. I don&#x27;t use attachments so I always end up just throwing those away.</li>
    <li> Still working great after 1-1/2 years.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Dries much faster than my last dryer.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer.  Gets the job done quickly.</li>
    <li> Wow this hair dryer is awesome.  You would not guess that it was so inexpensive. Usually take 10 minutes to dry my hair -- now it&#x27;s half that!</li>
    <li> Great dryer!  This is my favorite so far for my naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned ! I guess that &#x27;best-seller&#x27; thing right next to the product is reasonable. It has hot and warm and cold air selections, it dries my hair really quick (My hair is very thick and length is right above the bosom, so it usually took half an hour to dry) like in 10 minutes, it isn&#x27;t very loud either! It comes with two different parts to style your hair and I&#x27;m totally loving it!</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer,does not dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> Great！I have plenty hairs and it can dry them efficiently.</li>
    <li> I had this hair dryer for a few years but it recently just died when I dropped it on my bathroom floor. The hair dryer functioned OK and you&#x27;ll notice noticeably less hair static and frizz compared to non-ionic driers. However, I suggest that you consider paying a little more for a better Conair&#x27;s 225NP 1875 watt Tourmaline Ceramic hair dryer. I always found Revlon&#x27;s rear vent frustratingly difficult to clean, and I actually had to use vacuum attachments to clean out the accumulated lints and fuzz on the grill. Conair&#x27;s is a simple flip out grill with a smooth filter that I can simply wipe off easy. The Revlon dryer frequently sparked internally while in use for no apparent reason, and it was much louder and blowed noticeably weaker than Conair&#x27;s that I recently got as a replacement. Do yourself a favor and spend a bit extra for an appliance you&#x27;ll use daily for next several years.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I wanted a diffuser.  Many diffusers were more than this with no guarantee that they would fit my old blow dryer. I have used this a few times, it is light weight, really works well to enhance the curls and waves on my curly hair.  I do worry that it might not last a long time, due to how light weight it is and I have seen some other low reviews so I am saving &amp;#34;old faithful&amp;#34; just in case.</li>
    <li> Lightweight dryer that has great power for my curly hair. I use a diffuser .</li>
    <li> Dry&#x27;s hair quickly without too much heat.</li>
    <li> Works very well, better than the hair dryer it replaced.  No complaints at all</li>
    <li> The dryer just stopped working after about 4.5 months. Reset button doesn&#x27;t help. Looks like this is a trend with this product. I&#x27;d have given it a great review too, if I&#x27;d reviewed 3-4 months after purchase. But, again, not now. Just horrible.</li>
    <li> dries my curly hair in a short time; like this product( has two attachments.)</li>
    <li> practical, easy to use</li>
    <li> Seems to dry hair out, noticeably more &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; not less.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom, as she left hers in her room when returning from vacation.  She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> magical, my hair turned to be very smoothy  and soft.</li>
    <li> Worked well for about a year, then the cord shorted out. Guess I won&#x27;t be buying cheap dryers anymore.</li>
    <li> heats up very quickly, my hair is pretty thick and usually takes a while to dry, this dryer works very well for helping make the process less time consuming. I have used the extra piece to blow my hair out and it works well with a round brush at giving you a good blow out.</li>
    <li> love the different settings</li>
    <li> It is not as powerful as I wanted but it works fine.  I just wish the airflow was stronger.</li>
    <li> So far it is working good , I purchased this dryer a month ago . I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues . I feel like this dryer is some what big to handle.</li>
    <li> Massive internal failure after less than a year of use.  Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love the toggle buttons and the high low settings.&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
    <li> Ok, I can have a shower at night; and immediately go to bed with dry-hair.</li>
    <li> Terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started working fine. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best blowdryer but it did the job. Then out of the blue for no reason at all it broke down. It started making a veryyy loud engine like sound, makes you feel like its going to blow any second and it just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed I will have to buy a brand new blowdryer now (definitely not a Revlon)</li>
    <li> Love it! The second time I buy this same one!</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair feels after drying.  Easy to use.  Great price!</li>
    <li> Yup, believe the hype!  This is a great and reasonably priced blow dryer.  Works great, get it!</li>
    <li> My dryer is definitely not too hot, in fact both heat temps are almost the same.  It does the trick and I like that it&#x27;s not too hot for the grandchildren.</li>
    <li> I would like to return this blow dryer or exchange for another one. I used it once for a few minutes before work last week after having it in my possession for a couple of weeks and when I went to use it again today before work, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. After work I tested it again following the directions twice but it still isn&#x27;t working. Not sure what the problem could be because it is in great condition.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Price I right.  Fits in my hand well.  Works fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy! Product arrived as described and works like a charm. Great value!</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. It dries my hair in half the time. I almost bought a way more expensive dryer but I am glad I did not. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Just stopped working after 8 months. Dryer will turn on momentarily if you shake it. My hair is chin length and not thick, so it hasn&#x27;t been worked overly hard. I&#x27;ve never bought a hairdryer that didn&#x27;t last at least a few years.</li>
    <li> too big for household use!</li>
    <li> This works great - don&#x27;t waster your money, this one does a fabulous job!  I have been using this since Christmas and the results are fabulous - it is good to your hair!</li>
    <li> I am sure this blow dryer is great but I needed one with a comb attachment.  I had a comb attachment that fits any blow dryer and when I tried to fit it on this dryer; it repeatedly came off.  Also, the attachments that came with the dryer were very hard to get off and change.  This dryer is not for me, so I am sending it back.</li>
    <li> I am one of those who becomes attached to the hair dryers.  When the one I am used to finally breaks, it is agonizing trying to decide which one to get to replace it.  I am very happy with this one.  It is definitely hot enough to pull out the waves and curl in my hair.  I already dread the day it breaks.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about blow dryers so when I purchased this I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be great since the price was so good.  This blow dryer works perfectly!  I had long long hair and chopped off 8 inches and it worked for both long and short hair.  Very impressed</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great! Quick-drying, quick, and leave my hair feeling soft. Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned and at such a great price!</li>
    <li> As a guy with short hair, what I want in a hairdryer:  it should dry my hair fast, and not be incredibly annoyingly loud.  This hairdryer wins on both counts.  Bonus:  it is not that expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides:  after owning this for about 3 years, a small bright white spark shot out of it into my sink, and after that it only emitted warm air (and not hot).  No problem, I just replaced it with a second one (I guess I liked it enough to buy another one just like it).  It also comes with some bulky plastic attachments which I feel guilty throwing away, so they occupy too much drawer space and never get used.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer in 2009 and it didn&#x27;t die until 2013. I was very happy with it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> REally well priced and well built. It does the job without a lot of gadgets, and lots of parts . I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Love it so far. It dries my hair a lot faster and smoother than my old one. I don&#x27;t really get the people who complain about hitting the switches on the handle by accident. It&#x27;s lightweight enough that you don&#x27;t need to have a deathgrip on the handle, so I don&#x27;t find it to be a problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through so many hairdryers...it&#x27;s sad really. I cannot tell you how much I love this dryer. It doesn&#x27;t do anything remarkable, other than it is dependable and consistently drys my long (my hair goes almost down to my butt) hair in about 10 minutes. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best hair dryer I have ever used! I was skeptical of the price, but because of the price, I didn&#x27;t care if I hated it!  Plus, I was happy it came with the extra attachments! I couldn&#x27;t believe how light weight it was! Buy it already! You won&#x27;t hate it!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned. I am AF/AM with thick, curly, 4a hair and this hair dryer straightens it quickly without burning, over dryer or frizzing. I never use the highest heat setting (too hot). I use the medium heat setting on high. The only downside is that this hair dryer doesn&#x27;t come with a straightening pik (comb attachment). I had to purchase one separately. I have owned my hair dryer for over three years.</li>
    <li> I am impressed. On a news program I heard about the new Ionic hair dryers. I already had a Revlon Ionic hair dryer, but it was several years old, and worked just fine, but the price of this one was so reasonable I thought I would give it a try. Well what they said about the new ones was correct. This really does dry your hair in half the time. It is better for your hair, as it dries your hair with less heat! Not sure how that works, but it does. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Dries my hair in about 3 minutes! Love the power and the control! Not too large. Just the right size for my tiny asian hands</li>
    <li> i have been doing my hair for as long as i can remember. i have used many many hair dryers. I LOVE THIS ONE! its super light weight and it dries  my hair fast. i have really thick long wavy hair. my friends say its horse hair...but the first time i used it my hair was soooo soft and shiny i didnt even have to use my GHD flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;HINT: use argan oil and you&#x27;ll fall in love with your hair. and i also bought the Brush Lab ceramic brush and wow...love it! both of these products have made a HUGE difference!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my hairdryer that was about 10 years old.  I didn&#x27;t realize how awful my old one was until I got this new one.  It isn&#x27;t totally quiet, but it&#x27;s not as noisy as my old dryer.  I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s impossible to have a totally quiet hair dryer and still have any drying power, so I&#x27;m very pleased with this one.  This dryer does a pretty good job with noise control and it dries my hair very quickly.</li>
    <li> Two speeds, wasn&#x27;t too hot, heat was distributed well, lightweight.  I would recommend this product to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this less than a dozen times and each time for no more than 5 minutes and it no longer has hot air. Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> Going through hairdryers every 6 months was getting old.  This one has lasted much longer and is still going!  Revlon RV544 is like the Energizer Bunny.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer that I have used. It&#x27;s powerful yet perfect sized. It gets my hair dry in half the time as my older one.</li>
    <li> Seemed great. Fairly quiet. Exactly one year after buying it started to stop and start. It had to do with the angle of the cord. Two days after this, I heard a pop and saw a spark. A wire had broken and there was a burnt hole straight through cord. It was dead. Not pleased.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer ever, second one I am purchasing cause son used it and loved it</li>
    <li> Dries my hair super fast!  My hair feels so smooth after using this and stays that way all day.</li>
    <li> It is now July 2015 and this hair dryer started shooting sparks and caused a shock to my daughter when using it.  It was great while it lasted, but sorry I wasted my money if it only last less than 2 years.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I love my revlon hair dryer! Its easy to use and very sturdy! :)</li>
    <li> Died after 4 months. Apporox. 10 times used. It&#x27;s cheap...</li>
    <li> I like it, great price with good quality!</li>
    <li> Teen girl item #2 must have.Great Price and Value</li>
    <li> I love this dryer but less than 1 year after purchase, it died today.  It has a 24 month warranty but after paying postage to mail it and $5. for them, it doesn&#x27;t pay.  It&#x27;s cheaper just to get a new one which I&#x27;m doing today.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer about 2 years ago based upon the amazon reviews.  It dries my hair really fast and I like the diffuser that came with it for when I want to wear my hair curly.  However, 2 years later, it is losing power and I definitely do not dry my hair  with it everyday.  What used to be the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; blower setting, now seems like the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and the low setting barely pushes out air at all.  Not really that big of a deal given that I&#x27;ve had 2 good years of using it at such a low price.  I would just buy another one.</li>
    <li> Fast, frizz free drying.  Great blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Had this dryer for less than a year. Like other comments, the cord broke where it connected to the handle. Sparks and fire. Would NEVER buy this product again. Will be switching to Conair.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is defective.  The plug where it connects to the wall looks like it was tampered with, or perhaps burned from the inside out.  In order to make it run, you have to keep pressing the reset button until it &amp;#34;catches&amp;#34; and connects.  This started happening about a month after the return expired and the site shows no way to contact the seller.  Very poor quality product.  A hair dryer should last more than 3 months.  Maybe someone will contact me after this review.</li>
    <li> I have almost no hair due to military regulations, however my wife does and she loves it!</li>
    <li> This was the third Revlon we bought, and with each one the quality drops. This one lasted all of 8 months before it died. You get what you pay for. The only reason this got two stars was for the long cord. We found the cool air button annoying to have to hold down. Why not a switch?</li>
    <li> excellent hairdryer. Dries my thick hair fast.</li>
    <li> This dryer was great for the first 6 months I had it!  It dried my hair quickly and left a nice shine.  The settings are easy and it&#x27;s super light weight!  After 6 months of use, some times 3-4 times a week, I was drying my hair and the dryer kept changing it&#x27;s speed on it&#x27;s own.  I turned it off, unplugged it, reset my outlet, plugged it back in, reset the power cord and it worked fine for a moment.  30 seconds after, the cord sparked and caught fire!  The cord burned all the way through in less than 5 seconds.  I have had an electrician out to check my outlet, there is nothing wrong.  I use other heating tools and have never had this happen!</li>
    <li> I have had this product since 11/23/2014 and on, 08/10/2015 the cord broke, just like the other reviews, and burned me. DO NOT BUY! This dryer was well care for and the cord was never wrapped in a way that should cause the connection to the dryer to break. Bad design, faulty cord.</li>
    <li> Very light I.m very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is a great inexpensive hair dryer. Works like you need it to, had the accessories!!</li>
    <li> Works great, love it~</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews about how amazing this hair dryer is for the price. After trying it I have to totally agree.  It is super powerful and my hair dries in five minutes.</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy with how smooth and soft the hair dryer made my hair with out any product, but unfortunately, it already broke with in 4 months of my purchase..I tried several outlets, and concluded that it was indeed the hair dryer. Its cheaply made. I&#x27;m very disappointed, because I&#x27;ve loved using it so much. With only so much time to get ready in the mornings, it doesn&#x27;t leave much time to go out to buy a new one. Although, it&#x27;s reasonably priced and not expensive, it should not have broken this soon. Very disappointed..now it leaves me in the position to go out to have to buy a new one, which should have been avoided in the first place.</li>
    <li> Like mentioned in other reviews, the diffuser is junk, it&#x27;s very painful to use and flat. One person said &amp;#34;It&#x27;s like rubbing a dinner plate on your head&amp;#34;.... and honestly it&#x27;s worse than that. when you place it on your head, only two or three of the prongs are touching your head at the same time, which renders it useless. Just throw that piece away. If you&#x27;re looking for a blowdryer with a good diffuser, then you might want to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, the blow dryer itself is very quiet and nice. It&#x27;s lightweight which is an upgrade from my outdated dryer. This is a great alternative blowdryer compared to more expensive options. Would definately recommend if you can&#x27;t afford an expensive alternative or just don&#x27;t want to dish out lots of money for something thats going to need to be replaced in 5 years anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jennifer K.</li>
    <li> Bought this blow dryer some time ago because it definitely is a great package and price. BUT, the way the switches are placed on the handle could NOT be worse. I am constantly turning it off while trying to switch hands or positions. Major pain!!!!!  I will end up donating this just to get rid of it. Very, very bad design.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in March of 2013. I have thick wavy hair but usually dry it in sections. I used this dryer almost everyday and for no longer than 10 mins. I never wrapped the cord around the dryer, just folded it up (usually in half and in half again) and secured it with a loose hair tie. At the end of May while on vacation, I plugged the cord in and started the dryer. The cord melted and the wires sparked right near the top of the cord, just before it goes into the dryer. I never folded the cord or put stress on this area so I&#x27;m not sure what caused the spark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer worked just fine up until that day. It had plenty of air flow and the heat setting were perfect for my hair. I was just disappointed it lasted just over a year.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better then most, but fro me a hair dryer is a hair dryer..&lt;br /&gt;I see no difference between ionic and or ceramic units except they cost more..&lt;br /&gt;Long live CAPITALISM....</li>
    <li> The cold spot button doesn&#x27;t work. The drying function works o.k. I guess this is an example of you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer!  It is lightweight and easy to use and it works as well on my hair as my daughter&#x27;s more expensive Chi hairdryer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome. I like it. I recommend you buy it. Dry faster and  is not  to heavy. I love it</li>
    <li> My more expensive Baby Bliss broke after owning it a year...and I never liked the heavy weight of the Baby Bliss.  When I saw the word feather weight in the description on this Revlon that got my attention.  I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for a few months now and it&#x27;s been great.  My hair blow dries smooth, it has a lot of power, nice heat options...and it really is much lighter which makes it easier to hold up for a long period of time to dry my hair (my hair is long and thick)  I also love the rubber at the back of the blowdryer.  I can set it down on my bathroom counter, even when it&#x27;s turned on and the rubber keeps it from sliding off and crashing on the floor.  Nice touch Revlon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and provides the right amount of heat to dry my hair in half the time of my previous blow dryer. I have very fine hair but a lot of it so it tends to fluctuate in terms of how long it takes to dry and style my hair in the morning. That being said, I like that this is ionic and it takes a lot less time to dry my hair than my other dryer. The pieces are an added bonus as well. Not bad at all for the price.</li>
    <li> Broke within 3 months of regular use</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is a great deal for the money. Light enough, quiet enough, powerful enough. I bought one for my home and one for our lake house!</li>
    <li> I wondered how well made this hair dryer would be because it was so affordable.  Worry not, it is heavy and sturdy.  It dries my hair in half the time of my old dryer and with less heat too, which is better for my hair.  Great product and worth your money!</li>
    <li> This does a great job and I would have given it 5 stars but the cord is too short.  It needs another foot of cord</li>
    <li> Works great! Light weight and dries by hair quickly. Love the attachments that are included with the hair dryer. Price was right too.</li>
    <li> Unlike most people, I didn&#x27;t buy this product to dry hair. The water line to my ice maker froze and I used the hair dryer to thaw it out. The hot air from the dryer I believe is hot enough to burn skin. I could only hold my hand in front of it for a second or less. It worked for me, but I imagine it could damage hair in its hot setting. I guess that is what the diffuser attachment is for.</li>
    <li> Super light weight, a great price, and it does what it says. I have thick curly hair and normally have to blow dry and then use a straightning iron on my hair... and then it looks dried out or overly processed.     I used some thermal protectant and this dryer to both dry and straighten my hair today. It looks soft, shiny, and natural. The dryer is lightweight and easy to use. I was really surprised that I could basically skip the straight iron aspect and enjoy healthy, silky looking hair with this ionic dryer. I am also looking forward to using the diffuser for when I want to wear my hair curly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this back in Aug &#x27;08 from Amazon and I have finally gotten around to writing a review and it is definitely positive.  This replaced my old Vidal Sassoon which had lasted years but the screen got loose and caught in the fan and it was done.  I searched and finally settled on this.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that it actually DID dry my hair faster like the other reviews had said, and also without feeling like my hair is frying and, remarkably, it does feel quite soft compared to my old dryer.  My hair is medium to long and extremely thick (fine hair but a lot of it) so it still is amazing how fast this dries my hair- &lt;/&#x3D; 5 minutes. I never thought I&#x27;d care about that cold blast shot but it has come so handy as I do use hot rollers quite often.  This is also the quietest hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  A lower softer rumble from my old one.  I loved this hair dryer so much, when I saw the same model on sale at a local drug store chain later that year, I bought one for our family&#x27;s weekend place.  That&#x27;s when I noticed a HUGE difference.  The second one I bought was very loud, and sounded like it was working too hard.  I called the manufacturer and they couldn&#x27;t explain it.  That&#x27;s when my husband and I looked at both and noticed that the one I bought from Amazon had 4 FAN BLADES and the one I bought from the drug store had 7 FAN BLADES.  The customer service rep said that isn&#x27;t the reason why it sounded so bad but my husband and I were convinced and my husband is an engineer.  So, I went back to the drug store and found one out of the bunch that had the 4 FAN BLADES.  Voila!  It works as wonderfully as the first one I bought.  So, my advice is:    Be sure to get the one with 4 FAN BLADES.  I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d do that with Amazon, though.  I strongly feel there is a remarkable difference in loudness and performance.  This is an excellent hair dryer with the 4 fan blades.  It&#x27;s still going strong over two years later with daily use.  The second one I bought isn&#x27;t usedas often but is in same excellent condition.    UPDATE 1/8/11- thumbs down!  It seems I jinxed myself writing the above glowing review.  My hairdryer is slowly dying.  Its GFI plug kept tripping a couple of days and now my dryer is running on a low speed while on the high switch, the low switch is barely running at all.  Still have heat, hair is still drying but obviously I need a new dryer.  I just read a recent review on here that says she experienced the same problem, but within a matter of 2 months.  My dryer got a little over 2 years.  It was a great dryer but now if it is as claimed by the other reviewer that this is a common problem of it tripping and motor dying, I cannot really give a good review considering my old Vidal Sassoon lasted many years, if not for the loosened fan screen getting caught in the blades and ruining it.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this hairdryer. It has good power and I like the attachments. I like having the warm/hot heat settings and the high/low blower settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that if you want to use the cool temperature, you have to continuously hold down the cool button. It&#x27;s not a toggle. On my old Revlon hair dryer that this one replaced, if I clicked on the cool button, the cool stayed on until I clicked the cool again. That was nice for when I was doing some finishing with cool air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a good hair dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer!  Has to be the very best I have ever had.  Lightweight and easy to work with.  I only blow dry my hair with a round brush, no curling iron, and this is great!  I get great volume, hair is smooth, no flyaway or frizz. Wish I would have had a long time ago. Certainly would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly and was just informed about the wonder that is a diffuser. I didn&#x27;t want to buy a diffuser by itself as I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would fit my dryer. I found this on Amazon and am incredibly satisfied. It&#x27;s super light weight and dries my hair (with or without the diffuser) much faster than my old dryer. I also like the controls on the dryer. They are teeter-totter style buttons instead of the slider. Much easier for me to maneuver when using one hand. Did I also mention how light weight it is?! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product mainly because i just needed a hair dryer. I was tempted by its price and the brand. I have not used Revlon before, but i took chance just because of its name in the market. People who are not willing to pay a lot for expensive brands like Sedu and Babybliss, can opt for this one as it is cheap and good for daily use. Also, it has two attachments, one being concentrated drying and other, finger diffuser. Additionally, it has cold air and hot air switching control for your comfort. If you are not finicky about the styling of hair and are just concerned with drying, this is the product for you! The delivery was at my door, so what more can i say about it.&lt;br /&gt;i would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> When my old dryer died, I did some research on dryers.  This dryer is what I came up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a couple of years now and it works great.</li>
    <li> I had the T3, ready for a new one and after reading the reviews, thought I&#x27;d try this one for a better buy.  Definitely!!!  I have fine hair, and don&#x27;t see it being a problem</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer about 5 years ago and it died this morning.  So I came to Amazon and was happy to see they still made it and I purchased a new one.  I absolutely love it.  My hair is not super thick but I do have a lot of it and dries my hair very quickly.  I use it with the diffuser and my waves/curls come out looking great.  ***Update***  While I love how this dryer works, I do believe it&#x27;s a safety hazard.  The last two dryers I had started putting out sparks and one time burned my hand.  When it happened the first time, it was after using the dryer for about two years so I thought maybe it was defective or just old.  However, this morning it happened again and it was from the cord on the part right underneath the dryer.  If you see customer pics, that&#x27;s exactly what mine looked like.  I&#x27;m now going to go with a different brand of dryer.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer! It is so much lighter then my old clunker. Also the attachable nozzle is great for getting deep into your hair and drying your roots and whatnot. The heat settings are adequate and the beast part is that you can bring this with you to work or the gym because it wont weigh you down!</li>
    <li> After a really long search I kept finding good reviews on this Revlon RV544 tourmaline ionic lightweight and for that price I had to give a try, OMG it is really amazing I dried my hair in record time and the result ....., I had no frizz!!! The hair dryer is lightweight and not loud even my my two pounds Yorkie likes it and her very long silky hair looks Shiny and soft&#x27;, I love it would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> After looking for a blow dryer for several weeks and being quite surprised at how much they cost. (I hadn&#x27;t purchased one in a couple of years.) I could not understand why some of them cost as much as $250! I don&#x27;t see that the technology is that much different from the less expensive ones. So after reading the reviews on this blowdryer I purchased it and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have curly/kinky African-American hair that I must wash every day. I work outside the home so I have to dry my hair every day as well. This dryer is perfect. It doesn&#x27;t get too hot and fry my hair but it gets hot enough to get it dry quickly. The diffuser attachment fits perfectly and works well. The multiple heat settings are nice for drying my hair closer to my face - I can set it on a lower temperature. This is a fantastic blowdryer. It is lightweight and not very loud. Best deal for the money!</li>
    <li> It is great, not much noise comes out of it. It has been two months, we still love it. Thanks,</li>
    <li> I purchased this blow dryer last July after my Conair I purchased over 10 years ago at a yard sale for 50 cents finally died. To be honest I started using my Conair travel size every day when my regular blow dryer I had for several years finally died. I liked the size, power and heat setting. Unfortunately yesterday the blow dryer lost speed and is not sounding too well. Yes, it still has heat and 2 settings, but high now sounds like low and low sounds bad. FYI, I have very thin, fine, short hair, so I do not blow dry my hair for long periods of time.   I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s days are numbered, shame on me, but I have misplaced the receipt and Revlon will not fix without proof of purchase. I do a lot of research before making purchases and felt this was a very good blow dryer for a mid price. I will head back to the store today to begin the research process again to purchase a new blow dryer. It&#x27;s clear things are not made as well as they used to be. Hold on to your receipt and the original box, just in case.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and versatile . I am very happy with my recent purchase, love the simple settings. Easy to operate !</li>
    <li> I have used this dryer three times so far and I can say that it dries my hair noticeably faster than any of my previous dryers. I&#x27;m not sure about \\&quot;less damage\\&quot; claims and whatnot, but the drying time is cut in half. So far, the product has been worth the money.</li>
    <li> It was great while it lasted...which was only less than a year. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought one in August 2012, and the motor just went out. I think it&#x27;s a good value given the settings and attachments, so I&#x27;m ordering another one.</li>
    <li> I bought it with the intention of drying my hear after shower, but this just seems ways to big for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Great curling Iron.  Does everything it says</li>
    <li> Update 7/9/16 - I have bought 5 of these hair dryers in the past 2 years - all the same model.  When they work, they are fine.  They only last about 6 months.  I am going to try a different brand next time!  In the past, hair dryers have lasted many years for me, but not these!  Seems fine.  I had a similar model where the slide switch stopped working.  This model has a rocker switch which I hope last longer.  Does not seem as hot as the previous model, both 1875 watts - but okay.</li>
    <li> After a year of use this dryer shot molten lava metal pieces into my hair where they burned my hair and scalp. Never. Again.</li>
    <li> well made for the price like that you can control how hot the air blows on your hair . had others before paid more for them so far this one seems better and for less the price</li>
    <li> Very nice products. Keeps my girls happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift but my Daughter says it is wonderful</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Nothing fancy, but functional.  I m losing my hair, so I do not need the dryer like I used to</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer, and it puts out really warm air, but it leaves a little to be desired in the way of how much air it puts out.</li>
    <li> Seriously the best hairdryer ever. Old one broke and bought this because of the high reviews. Great price, great hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I only owned this for a couple of months before it sparked and quit on me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommended it to anyone personally. Would definitely been a better product if it would have lasted!</li>
    <li> I love it, It is much better than the one I had.  I am learning how to use the attachments, so I am better able to use it.</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying the product was delivered when promised and is as described. I have not had it for more than a month or so but it works fine though a bit larger and weightier than expected.</li>
    <li> Dries hair quickly. I like the flexibility of the settings.  I&#x27;ve never used the attachments, so can&#x27;t really speak to that.</li>
    <li> Very light weight, powerful, and relatively low sound. Very good for the price. Love the diffuser attachment. Highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I love this. It doesn&#x27;t make the lights flicker like my other machines do. I only use the diffuser for my curly hair and it defines my curls so much better.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter in law. She loves it! So do I! It is ionic and there is no electricity causing your hair to fly everywhere during and after drying. As you may have guessed, I have been using it too. It does all it advertises to do. I&#x27;m sure it is equal to much more expensive hairdryers.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair, so I was pleased with the reviews of this product. It still takes a while to dry my hair, but I guess it is a little better than any other hair dryer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I am a guy, who likes to dry his short hair sometimes, when I&#x27;m traveling abroad or in need.  I was pretty happy with this product at first. it did pretty good, though the buttons settings didn&#x27;t matter, it was just turned \\&quot;on\\&quot; or \\&quot;off\\&quot;, and when \\&quot;on\\&quot; it was really noisy and strong, but impotently, HOT.  It always had a weird smell to it, and then one day the plastic of the black cap just melted and there was a hole. I took the plastic head off and saw that the heat actually melted the fan itself, and it caused really bad smell. Then the sparks started. Really bizarre sparks of electricity from inside the fan, and last week, it just stopped heating at all. I took pictures to show the condition of this product after almost 2 months of usage: [...]</li>
    <li> I have hair down to my middle back so blow drying is always an extremely time consuming chore. Not anymore! With the concentrator attachment it takes me 5 minutes to dry my hair, 7-8 if I&#x27;m styling it using the blow dryer. The end of the dryer is a little warm after use, it won&#x27;t burn you. But I do recommend letting it cool off on the counter for a couple minutes before putting it away.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. Works excellent and was reasonably priced. Delivered as promised. Loved hot and cold function. G</li>
    <li> Extremely noisy so gave it away and bought a quieter one.</li>
    <li> My previous hair dryer was a ridiculously expensive salon model, and it broke, rather quickly.  I replaced it with this.  It works great, was inexpensive, and won&#x27;t break my heart when it stops working because it cost so much less than the salon model!</li>
    <li> This dryer felt a little cheaper than I expected it to, but it works great and leaves my hair nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it.  It&#x27;s just as others have said.  It basically cut the drying time in half.  It&#x27;s easy to use.  It&#x27;s lightweight.  It&#x27;s inexpensive.  Nothing to complain about at all!</li>
    <li> I was hesitate about purchasing this dryer because I have used a CHI for 10 years, until it quit. I am not financially able to spend that kind of money right now so I bought this one for the time being, until I can get another CHI, but after using the Revlon I have no intention to replace it. It does the job just as well as my old CHI, if not better. I love this blow dryer !!!!</li>
    <li> does the job but not quite the air flow I was expecting</li>
    <li> Was good. More than expected for the price.</li>
    <li> This dryer stopped working within a week.</li>
    <li> Lasted less than 6 months.  Maybe even less. Caught on fire at the base of the hair dryer and the wire.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer lasted about 10 months.  It is still working, but barely--it keeps turning off and on, so I am now shopping for a new one.  I had to leave this review as I saw that this is one of the most popular hair dryers on Amazon.  I&#x27;m not wasting my money on another Revlon.</li>
    <li> I have had this dryer for several weeks now and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t blow too hot or too cool.  It&#x27;s perfect.  It&#x27;s lightweight, quieter than most and just pleasurable to use.  I am surprised it is so inexpensive.... I love it!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works fine.  It doesn&#x27;t get my hair dry faster or make it shinier than anything else on the market in the $20 range.  Sometimes my hand hits the power level button by accident, which is a little annoying.  There&#x27;s nothing really wrong with it, but after all the high reviews I guess I expected it to be something special.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine basic hair dryer. Moderate weight, heats up quickly enough. I don&#x27;t like the switches and their placement. It&#x27;s easy to flip one of the switches while you are using the dryer, and the cold air button is awkwardly placed. Also, the attachments don&#x27;t fit on very securely. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase but don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
    <li> Hi...I ordered this hair dryer before Christmas but it never arrived...after getting tired of sticking my head out of the car window to dry my hair I contacted the friendly Elfs at Amazon and they had a replacement unit shipped out the next day!!! WOW.. I have noticed my local mail delivery person having extra fluffy hair recently. Oh well.. at least I got my hands on what I think is the best hair dryer for the price.... it is light weight..well balanced and does a great job of drying what little hair I have left on my head. My Labradoodle likes it too after her bath!</li>
    <li> Frizzy frizzy low powered hair drier</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace a Conair retractable cord model that no longer worked. I spent a few days trying to decide between this model and a more expensive (different brand) model but ultimately decided on this one due to the low price and generally favorable reviews.  This hair dryer is average -- it does its job but not overly well. The highlights are that it is extremely lightweight, very quiet, and the cord length is more than adequate.  Unfortunately, it does not get nearly as hot as my previous hair dryer nor does it blow very hard, even on hot temp and high speed. In fact, I have noticed contrary to what the hair dryer claims, that it indeed takes LONGER to dry my hair. I find myself letting my hair air-dry for 30 minutes or so before using the hair dryer so it doesn&#x27;t take so long. The ion feature may or may not make a difference. My hair is smoother after using this hair dryer, but that may be because it is more gentle than my previous one by not getting as hot or blowing my hair around.  I have two Maltese that get weekly baths, and I would like to note that I LOVE this hair dryer for them. I use the concentrator attachment when I dry them and it works wonderfully. I just wish it had a little more heat and power behind it for use on my long, straight, blonde hair.</li>
    <li> This dryer quit working after less than a year.  Don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
    <li> I have long really thick, natural (spiral) curls. Its hard to blow dry my hair. The finger diffuser attachment works really well for me. It does still take quite a bit of time to dry my hair, but this Revlon Dryer does it without causing my hair to frizz! Love that!</li>
    <li> I rarely ever use this hair dryer as I have curly hair and wanted one for that rare occasion to have a diffuser. It still makes my hair frizzy, but does the job.</li>
    <li> As a family of engineers, I didn&#x27;t buy into a lot of the hype that some of the high priced ($100+) hair dryers bring in their ads.  This dryer has most of the key features of the high priced dryers and does dry my hair faster than my old college cheapskate dryer.  I really did notice a difference in time it took to dry my long hair.  Plus it is lightweight - not painful on the arm.  I found this dryer online being listed as the top dryers (4 years in a row) and the #2 dryer cost $150!!!  (I did a good amount of online research)  Unless you are a commercial user of hair dryers (requiring a much heavier duty motor), this dryer is a GREAT buy at ~$20.  Think of it like I did, I can replace this dryer 7 times and still not pay as much as the #2 dryer...awesome.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair dryer that I tried at my daughters and loved it. It is light weight, stays hot and dries quickly. The cord is of good length as well. Shipping was quicker than stated. Amazon does a great job!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer worked great and was light weight when it worked. After 1 year though it started to blow at 25% power and eventually it just died completely. I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer last just 1 year. Revlon needs to work on their product reliability.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer.  Works really well on my short hairstyle.  Very quiet!</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer it dries hair quickly,less static,more shine</li>
    <li> After 1 month this dryer has been broken.</li>
    <li> I do not have thick hair, it usually takes 5-7 minutes to fully dry my hair, but this dryer left my hair Poofy and frizzy and feeling charred.  The power and heat are NON EXISTENT. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Fascinating piece of equipment.  Drys hair in half the time, even long hair. Smooths, shines and eliminates the frizzes.  I just love my hair dryer.  It&#x27;s so convenient and saves so much time without damaging my hair like some high heat dryers.  Don&#x27;t loan it out or you won&#x27;t get it back.</li>
    <li> I did research before purchasing.  The reviews on this dryer were very helpful.  I only have previously owned Conair and just bought the cheapest.  Until now I didn&#x27;t realize there is a difference in dryers.  My daughter has thick hair and I have thin hair.  It works great and dries quickly for both of us.  The discounted price was an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a bigger, but more quiet hairdryer. This one is ok. I don&#x27;t use the attachments. It does get my hair dry in a shorter time than my previous one. It&#x27;s not really quiet but I do like the settings because my youngest doesn&#x27;t like how hot it can get, so I do the low setting for her.</li>
    <li> There are two settings for heat - warm and heat and 2 settings for air speed - high and low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this - you can pretty much cover any need for hair dryers for any density - we have twin boys who are 2 years old, 6 year old and me and my wife !  and it works pretty well for all of us</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this hair dryer at this price.  Has 2 heat and 2 speed seatings and is light weight.</li>
    <li> Works great and very light. Great product and service.</li>
    <li> The only downside is that the cool button is more of a warm air button but hey it&#x27;s close enough. The attachments are fantastic.</li>
    <li> Drys hair in half the time , my hair is long past my but. Takes less then 10.mins to do the job, added shine too</li>
    <li> It lasted about 9 months just about what the warranty is worth on it.</li>
    <li> I like its lightweight!!!</li>
    <li> It works like a champ.  Don&#x27;t share it with your spouse or children, because you will never see it again.</li>
    <li> I have long, moderately thick hair and this does a great job of drying in a short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer - much faster than the drugstore one I had before.</li>
    <li> This was my SECOND hair dryer from Amazon.  They don&#x27;t label their merchandise as made in China, so I keep getting small appliances that are DEAD ON ARRIVAL!  Total waste of my time.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It does exactly what I need it to do.  My hair is naturally baby fine, but I have a lot of it, so it can take forever to dry my hair.  This hair dryer dries my hair quickly and does not leave my hair frizzy or tangled.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before I decided on this one, and it paid off. I love this -- compared to my old dryer, the &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; is less intense and the &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34; is stronger, which really helps avoid getting my curly hair too dry. It&#x27;s also less noisy, which is a big plus. I only use the diffuser when I&#x27;m not in a hurry, but I do like its size, and that it makes my scalp feel amazing from the mild stimulation the cones give.</li>
    <li> Works great I love this blow dryer and it was exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> This blow dryer dries my thick hair super quickly.  Great price too.  The diffuser attachment is super helpful, as is the &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting</li>
    <li> Worked well for the price (there are much better and more powerful out there if you spend more) but stopped working after a few months.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer worked great, I loved that it didn&#x27;t give my hair the fried look. I have thick, long hair that is course in texture, and this hair dryer actually gave my hair a more smooth appearance. The only reason I give it 3 stars, is because the wiring shorted out approx. 5 1/2 months after buying it.  I am looking for another one now, but I will have to try a different brand that will hopefully last longer than this one did.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer. For the price it does a very fast job. It&#x27;s simple to use. Just a plain hair dryer that works great!!</li>
    <li> This dryer is a lot better in so many ways than my previous one. It&#x27;s much quieter, lighter and dries my hair faster. It gives me more time to do other stuffs before going to work.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer for home use.  Very powerful and lightweight without being noisy.  Probably not that packable for travel but a good choice for home use.</li>
    <li> works great.  Does great job drying my thick hair!</li>
    <li> Drys hair really fast ! Great price. Diffuser works well too. Can&#x27;t complain</li>
    <li> Bought in April of 2015 &amp;#34;here&amp;#34;. &amp;#34;Literally&amp;#34;, just this morning, --it just, went &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;, in the outlet, smoke and smell... so 1.5 years to last? I&#x27;ve had dryers last 10+, and gave away. I don&#x27;t get it, --built in to self destruct? Certainly no warranty to &amp;#34;now&amp;#34;. So, just &amp;#34;fyi&amp;#34; on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, today went from 4 Stars, OK to 1 Star, &amp;#34;hate it&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -- Hey Revlon I&#x27;d expect at least 5 years. I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;guy&amp;#34; and not using this other to dry my hair after a shower, so runs, what 3 mins a day, --only. Geese.</li>
    <li> For the price this is great! It dries my hair a lot faster than my old hair dryer. It is lightweight and so far has proven to be durable (packing to take to the gym or weekend excursions).</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and 4 months later, the cable that connects to the hair dryer itself is causing the dryer to shut off and on randomly. After seeing all the picture of people with broken connections and fires, we are no longer going to use this hair dryer. Too much of a safety concern and I would advise people to not purchase this until this dangerous defect is fixed.</li>
    <li> Yea, I love this. It is amazing for the price. If you are a novice at hair care get this because it helps you to transition to something more expensive. It does what it is supposed to do and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving it. Would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price. I&#x27;m so happy after a double disappointment with T3.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy this dryer, I had one in my previous apartment and I left it there for the new tenant. The first one lasted almost two years, having some electrical issues at the end, but still working good overall. Got this one about a week ago, and it works just great, massive air flow rate when requested, temperature adjustment switch, diffusor and other parts included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (August 2014): As many other reviews, the second dryer started having problems after about 10 months of use. You had to hold the cord pushed towards the handle to make it work, meaning that wires inside the cord might have been ruined. Then one day, puff, the coating is gone and fireworks as if it was July 4th.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely dangerous, would not recommend. Two stars just because, when it does work, it&#x27;s incredibly powerful.</li>
    <li> Would give it a zero If I could. When it works it&#x27;s a good hair dryer. It began to turn off and on while I was blow drying my hair even though power was on and therefore, Would take 15 minutes to blow dry what would take 5-7max. Now it won&#x27;t even turn on. I had my old hair dryer for years and this one only months and it is caput. Don&#x27;t buy!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this hair dryer for just over 6 mos and have really enjoyed it for my fine shoulder length hair.  However, today when I turned it on, something inside POPPED, started smoking, and now it no longer works.  I&#x27;m going to order another, but only because it&#x27;s discounted 50% and for that price, I feel like it&#x27;s a good buy for 6-7 months of usage.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to try out this product very well because my long hair is constantly getting sucked into the back of the dryer. I would not recommend to those with long hair who flip their heads while blow drying.</li>
    <li> very light and works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad as I bought a refurnished product, and it arrives like a NEW product.&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I had  an old dryer finally give up the ghost.  I didn&#x27;t know how much better the new ones are! Glad to find this as now I have much fewer fly aways!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! I have fine hair so it doesn&#x27;t usually take long to dry my hair anyway, but using this hair dryer takes even less time. I wish it had a retractable cord for easy travel, but I make it work when I need to go on vacation. I don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
    <li> it light but functions very well, which can dry the hair very quickly. We can also choose how strong of the wind and how hot or warm it is.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. Cheap and very good</li>
    <li> The quality just equals to the price. Love its simple and light weight design. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I have thought, like it.</li>
    <li> Good, temperature is high, dries fast.</li>
    <li> Lightweight so good for travelling. Not as powerful as I had expected for a 1875W dryer so couldn&#x27;t depend on it for day to day use.  Would be fine if hair needed no styling or great heat and power. Handy to have for own use in USA as hotel hairdryers tend not to be powerful.</li>
    <li> I compared prices and am happy with the quality for the price of this product.  Lightweight is also a plus.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair in a super jiffy! I have long but fine hair, so it never takes very long to dry, but this dryer is super fast.</li>
    <li> Previous model lasted several years. Bought same model and it works great.</li>
    <li> I needed a new hair dryer. This was the first one that caught my attention. Not only was it a good price, it&#x27;s an excellent hair dryer! It dries my hair fast, it&#x27;s quiet, and doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
    <li> wife just loves this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these several years ago.  I was always impressed with the \\&quot;thrust\\&quot; that would quickly dry my hair.  About 6 months ago, my trusty hairdryer broke down.  I liked the original so much I was really happy to see the same \\&quot;model\\&quot; was still being made, so I jumped to get another.  Although this looks exactly the same, it doesn&#x27;t have nearly the power as the previous one.  Not a bad dryer, just isn&#x27;t as good as it used to be.  If I got the original, this would have be 5 stars no problem.  But I can only give it 4 now.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to buy her a new hair dryer. Now my wife is not picky, but I did want one that she&#x27;d like. After my search I chose this Revlon product. I made a hit. It&#x27;s light and powerful. She was able to dry and style her hair with ease.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t actually give it a review since I bought to for my wife &amp; she&#x27;s never used it. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s okay, but anything above or below 3 stars I won&#x27;t commit to.</li>
    <li> 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned.  First lasted a long time, this one gave out too fast (loud buzz for a few days, then a clank and smoke).  Good price and worked fine.  Nothing amazing.  Average noise and weight.  But don&#x27;t want to have to buy replacements so quickly.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is awesome!! The price isn&#x27;t high and it works great. It dries your hair very fast without overheating your hair. The next day, the hair looks SHINY!!!! I&#x27;m surprised. It stopped working after 4 months, but I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one. It works perfect now!! Strongly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Dry fast, but heavy. It is the heaviest dryer I hv ever had. A lot more heavier than my previous plastic dryers. Is ceramic better than plastic? I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m always afraid I will drop it cud it&#x27;s so heavy.</li>
    <li> Dries fast and reduces frizz substantially. Good buy!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this in July of this year and it is no longer working. There is short in the cord and it continually goes on and off. The return window has expired. There should be some exception for a defective item.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. I have thick curly hair and this dries my hair fast when I want to straighten my hair. My hair is shiny and frizz free when I use this. It also does a great job when I use the diffuser to curl my hair. Diffusers are hard to find that work well and this one limits frizz and maximizes my curls.</li>
    <li> leaves dry hair very soft.</li>
    <li> Its a little big and unwieldily, but it dries really nicely.  If you need to pack it and travel, its not the best choice.</li>
    <li> I have had this dryer for one month and it has broken and needs to be thrown out. It suddenly started smelling like burnt plastic and went to 25% of its original power and then stopped working altogether.</li>
    <li> Really like this dryer, now that my hair is longer I use the diffuser &amp; even though it takes just a little longer to dry, my hair is softer &amp; healthier.</li>
    <li> Exactly like i expected!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok blow dryer. Gets the job done. A little weak, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Have had this dryer for 10+ years and I use it as a diffuser for my curly hair...its the best :)</li>
    <li> Good price, nice performance</li>
    <li> Good product. Light wight.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter loves this blower for their curly hair</li>
    <li> So far so Good.  Great Power</li>
    <li> It works well for Meduim to long hair. It does not get as warm as a traditional hairdryer.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It has so many settings on it, and my hair dries quicker.</li>
    <li> This is not a T3. I repeat, this is not even close to a T3. My wife has a T3 and that thing dries hair in less than half the time and leaves it soft and shiny. This thing although it has the Tourmaline and ceramic thing going on does not do anything close to what the T3 can do. That being said, you can buy 5 or 6 of these things for the price of just 1 T3 so its not a fair comparison at all, however, I felt it is important for those of you out there wondering if this will do the same job. IT WILL NOT. It does a good job, but not a great job like the T3.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer in 2011, and have used it almost every day since.&lt;br /&gt;--It gets hot enough to dry my thick hair, as well as has good high/low settings.&lt;br /&gt;--The &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting is not too hot to dry my daughter&#x27;s hair if you keep it more than 5&amp;#34; away from her head.&lt;br /&gt;--It&#x27;s not as loud as some models out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It finally decided to die today after many many uses. I believe the fan is out, as it was making an awful sound and no air was coming out. I know it&#x27;s been dropped multiple times, as well as being tossed into a drawer, so I am sure the wear and tear was too much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this five stars, because for the price and as functional as it is, I have no problem buying it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who has a shoulder injury but was using a much more powerful and heavy dryer. First off, she&#x27;s always had short, fine, permed hair. It doesn&#x27;t take much to dry her hair to begin with but she&#x27;s a stubborn one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this. She declined the gift saying it was too light, therefore, assumed it was cheaply made &amp; wouldn&#x27;t last long. WRONG. I kept it for myself &amp; have been using it for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, long hair... and a LOT of it. I usually use it on the high setting &amp; don&#x27;t really care about the warm/hot heat setting. I just blow dry my hair to get it MOSTLY dry so when I leave to work, it&#x27;s not sopping wet &amp; dripping onto my shirt. This does the job. I blow dry for about 3min &amp; I&#x27;m done. After my 15-20min drive to work, my hair&#x27;s completely dry. It&#x27;s been 13 months and no problems at all.</li>
    <li> This dryer is nothing fancy but it does the job! 2 heat settings, a cool setting, and high/low speeds. pretty basic. It gets my fine hair dry in no time tho! much faster than  any other dryer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. It&#x27;s lightweight and powerful. I have thin, curly hair and with the diffuser and the High Heat/Low Power setting, I have dry hair in about 10 minutes. No frizzies! My hair actually holds its curl better for 2-3 days than it does drying naturally. My arm doesn&#x27;t get tired while holding the hair dryer, either. I can use my phone in one hand and blow dry in the other. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> My old hairdryer (Conair Infinity Pro orange dryer) was so much more powerful.  I have thick hair and hate drying it because it takes so long.  This Revlon dryer is about medium power from my experience.  I didn&#x27;t get another Infinity because there had been recalls on it so thought it best to wait, and it was heavy, but I&#x27;d rather deal with the weight and have my hair dry faster.  I had dropped my old one and it broke.  I will probably make do with this one for awhile but I miss my Infinity!  This one is very light, it almost feels like a toy.  Despite the seemingly weak air coming out it dries in a reasonable amount of time and isn&#x27;t too frizzy (I usually have to flat iron my hair just to get the pouf down even after drying it straight with a brush).</li>
    <li> I would have given this dryer 5 stars except for 1 thing - the on/off button should be located a little lower.  I find myself accidentally turning the dryer off during use sometimes because my thumb hits the button.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise,  I love how fast it dries my hair and keeps it from getting frizzy.  Also, it is not too heavy.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has absolutely all the qualities I most desire with three small exceptions: I wish it had a retractable cord, a folding handle, and that it was smaller.  Still, this is the best model I have found for a low noise, powerful tourmaline ionic ceramic dryer at the best price!</li>
    <li> Purchased this after my Conair started getting very hot in the handle. I love the way this works. Dries my hair quickly. The only downfall is the switch. It&#x27;s a flip switch located right on the handle. It&#x27;s very easy to turn the dryer off while I&#x27;m in the middle if drying my hair. But other than that, I love this one!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth it.  Good price, good product.</li>
    <li> It takes longer time than I expected to dry my hair. Overall is ok.</li>
    <li> Def not a top of the line ionic dryer. For the price, I should have expected it... It is not any better than the blow dryer I have had for 8 years.</li>
    <li> Best purchase!!! Multiple settings. Salon quality. Dries hair quickly and it&#x27;s quiet. So happy with this. Arrived within a day or two after I ordered.</li>
    <li> A great reasonably priced hair dryer - my daughter loves it!  It is easy to handle and dries your hair FAST!</li>
    <li> Worked well while it lasted but now dead after 18 months, not overly used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it 2 times per week average .</li>
    <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t blow.And Too big.This is not strong at all for long hair, it takes way long time to dry.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hairdryer!! I was amazed at how quickly it dries my hair. I have thick hair and it has always taken me a long time to dry my hair but this dryer has cut time in half or more!!!</li>
    <li> Good to use with nice price.</li>
    <li> I bought this two years ago. I am the only user. Motor just went last night. It must have shorted out as it got very hot and not at the front end. How long should this last? The one it replaced was 16 years old. It worked fine until it quit.  Update : this unit just died. So it lasted 18 months. Started to arch as the cord entered the unit. Wire was broken inside. Trash for most but I did rewire it. Was hoping it would at least get through the warranted period.</li>
    <li> Great!!!!! I love it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair dryer, only downside is that the power cord is not retractable so it tends to get a little twisted up.  Overall it&#x27;s a solid product though.</li>
    <li> Piece of garbage.  Arrived broken.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! however it&#x27;s kind of weak and it feels really cheap. But hey it does the trick.</li>
    <li> I got this based on a well known reviewing website and I&#x27;ve been pleased. The design is good except for the position of the buttons and the cord is longer than most.</li>
    <li> This dryer does what it&#x27;s suppose to but has a short life span.  Like what another review said, this dryer died after a year of use.  Another negative is how the buttons are positioned.  While using the dryer, my fingers are accidentally turning the dryer on and off.</li>
    <li> Was broken in 1,5 year...But it is really a lightweight. Also, enough power. So, if you do not mind to buy every 1,5 hair dryer - it is for you.</li>
    <li> Worked great until we tested the GFCI feature. It wouldn&#x27;t turn back on even after pressing the reset button.</li>
    <li> Good all around hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer in June of 2014....it lasted 6 MONTHS before it broke (the wire near the base of the hair dryer developed a crack, causing the power to stop on/off depending on which way you were holding it.)  And then the sparks started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple product on paper, a lousy product in reality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too small for the amount of hair i have, but it work amazing for my hair bangs! I recommended for people with thin hair.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with this as a hair dryer, It is just a little heavy and awkward to hold.</li>
    <li> We worth it for the cost of product.</li>
    <li> Works great so far and was cheaper then Walmart.</li>
    <li> After purchasing 2 Salon Professional Hair Dryers at prices over $100 each, I decided to check on consumer reviews and found this Revlon RV544 with top ratings.  It is light weight weight hot temp - which is what I was looking for.  It&#x27;s a steal for $20.00.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I did check it out and it will be just fine for me.</li>
    <li> Great value, lightweight, works with lots of power and has the necessary attachment, but is louder than I hoped. Diffuser snaps on very tight so no fear of falling off...</li>
    <li> Going on 3 years now, if it ever breaks I want one just like it.</li>
    <li> This is basically a good dryer and certainly good enough for the low price; however, there is one design flaw that is a daily irritation.  The placement of the on/off switch on the bottom of the inside of the handle results in the unintentional turning off of the dryer while in use.  The dryer is lightweight and effective.</li>
    <li> For the price, this dryer did not last as long as I expected.</li>
    <li> It is a very good dryer. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Love it! No frizz and soft curls!</li>
    <li> For a cheap blow-dryer, this one is my favorite. I have two that I use, one at my apartment, and one at my fiance&#x27;s place. This one is my preferred blow-dryer. It dries super fast without giving me crazy static, OR without burning my hair.</li>
    <li> Nothing special.... i wish little more cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love the different heat settings and cool setting, I have curly hair and this dryer does wonders with a diffuser.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer about 8 years ago, and it finally died on me this morning. Overall, it&#x27;s been a really good hair dryer, so I&#x27;m buying another one. The diffuser does a great job on my curly hair.</li>
    <li> not enough power as id like to have, but great purchase for the price</li>
    <li> The unit is nicely made, quiet, and provides enough heat even at it&#x27;s LOW setting for fast drying of your hair. For $20 I shouldn&#x27;t complain. But!&lt;br /&gt;1) Despite some of the reviews describing it as &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; this is not a shrinking violet. All opinions related to size are subjective but to me it looks pretty close to units used in saloons. Hopefully this means a larger and longer lasting motor.&lt;br /&gt;2) The unit is ONLY 110VAC, despite that it&#x27;s advertised by Amazon as &amp;#34;it also available for shipping to select countries outside the U.S&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;3) The manual is a joke, but it&#x27;s not funny. (It has footnote &amp;#34;appliance may vary from the illustrations&amp;#34;,  but it omits to mention that it may  vary from the descriptions as well.)&lt;br /&gt;a) voltage selector - doesn&#x27;t exists. It&#x27;s a bit late to find this out after you&#x27;ve purchased the item&lt;br /&gt;b) Removable end cap /clean the lint filter: &amp;#34;REMOVE IT BY TURNING IT COUNTERCLOCKWISE&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;  By all means if you&#x27;re ready to break it off completely. Mine opens by pressing a hidden latch at the top of the end cap and has a hinge at the bottom that I wasn&#x27;t brave (or fool) enough to try to force off: &amp;#34;to be washed and cleaned&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Well I got this amazing hairdryer in Jul 2013 and after a little over a year (Sep 2014), the cord is causing the thing to not work in certain positions. I thought it was the plug, but came to find out that it was the cord attached to the dryer. When it&#x27;s bent a certain way the dryer stops working. That&#x27;s never happened to me with any other dryer so perhaps I will try to figure out what the warranty is on this. I do like this dryer a lot though, it&#x27;s is so lightweight and dries fast. I will buy it again if the warranty doesn&#x27;t cover it.</li>
    <li> Great power and light.  Wonderful price!</li>
    <li> The section of the cord right below the dryer became worn out way too quickly and caused the electrical cords to become exposed and start sparking.</li>
    <li> good and strong enough</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this hairdryer long at all. I was perfectly happy with it until the cords at the base completely broke and sparks flew out. I read a few other reviews to see if this only happened to me, but I am not the only one. I don&#x27;t want to feel afraid when drying my hair!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer based on the good reviews. My hair feels much more smooth and shinny after using this product. I am looking for a light weight one and this one is OK, not that light but not too heavy as some models in the market. Overall I like the product but it stopped working right after 2 years. My other hair dryer last much longer. So 3 stars.</li>
    <li> blows WAAAAY too hot, so hot that it&#x27;s now melting the end of my dryer and I&#x27;ve only had it less than 4 months, but because it only had a 30 day return policy, I can&#x27;t return it. I&#x27;ve burnt my fingers drying with it</li>
    <li> Great Blow dryer. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I like this hairdryer. It is very powerful and handy. It dries my hair fast and i like the additional items that come together with the dryer where i can curl my hair or blow straight. It is really worth spend item. I&#x27;ve been using for more than one month.</li>
    <li> Widely loves it.. Works perfectly on her long hair.. 100% satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product, I purchased it 14 months ago here on amazon and it has totally stopped working on me. I have never had a blow dryer with such a short lifespan. It works well when it worked, but I fear it&#x27;s just outside of warrenty and I am off to buy a new dryer.</li>
    <li> So far this is the best hairdryer I have ever bought. I have thick hair that holds a lot of water and it cut my drying time in half. I also don&#x27;t have to use a straightening iron anymore which is a plus. It&#x27;s lightweight and not noisy like other dryers. I would definitely recommend this dryer to others.</li>
    <li> love it....easy to use</li>
    <li> Hair dryer keeps overheating and shutting itself off.  Even when on warm mode.</li>
    <li> Works okay but the grip on the handle doesn&#x27;t fit my hand at all. I keep hitting the turn off switch which is annoying! I end up turning it off several times blowing my hair dry. I wish I could hold several models instead of taking a chance buying online.</li>
    <li> Perfect if you&#x27;re looking for something lightweight. It works great, just smaller than expected. Its just easier to blow-dry my long hair with a slightly larger hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Cut my dry time in half!!</li>
    <li> best quality dryer at an affordable price! Doesnt burn my hair, leaves it shiny and smooth every time and cuts drying time significantly! Def pick this up!</li>
    <li> Great dryer! My hair dries in half the time with no frizz!</li>
    <li> Great dryer works fast</li>
    <li> Used it in India. Burnt out in a minute! Had not specified the wattage</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer. I like the buttons on the handle, because they do not get in the way like some other hair dryer buttons do. The setting I like best is Low Heat, with High Power. It dries my short hair in about five minutes. It isn&#x27;t too heavy for my arthritic hands to hold while I style and dry. This one is a great pick if you don&#x27;t need fancy bells and whistles. It does the job.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Used this less than 20 times and it burned out, smoking....</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair which means... naturally frizzy hair, if anything goes wrong which it usually does. I have used an ionic, ceramic hair dryer for a while now. Never noticed a huge difference with that. The improvement from this model is the diffuser. I haven&#x27;t used other diffusers, so I have no basis of comparison but if you are a curly girl or guy, adding a diffuser to your arsenal is worth it. It&#x27;s a different way of drying your hair. I&#x27;m still adjusting to it-- you place the end of the diffuser against your head in one area and hold it there while it gently puffs air all around it. We&#x27;re supposed to tousle our hair with the diffuser &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; but I mostly bonk myself in the head when I do that-- much better to use the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; to gently cup the end of your hair so it gets scrunched up against your head-- and then hold it there for a minute. Then move on to a new spot on your head. What I&#x27;ve noticed is that my hair curls more evenly than before. I used to have areas that would flatten a bit even with the low speed of a regular blow dryer. You can imagine how lovely that looked. Now all the areas are a bit more uniformly curled and there are fewer flyaways on top. Other blow dryers with diffuser attachments may do the same thing-- this one was a good price and had the ionic/ceramic combo I wanted. I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note-- the diffuser is pretty big so you&#x27;ll need a deeper drawer or a bit more cupboard space to store it.</li>
    <li> much more powerful than my last hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Dried your hair fast! Just as advertised!</li>
    <li> Been using for years.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer.  I have no complaints on this one.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer! It really dries my long hair quickly (10 min). And my hair doesnt need much styling afterwards! :)</li>
    <li> I loved this hair dryer, then 8 months after purchase it blew up on me. It literally sparked and caught fire seemingly out of no where.</li>
    <li> I am a beginner using hair dryer. I moved to US one year back , and in India natural weather is enough for fast drying [ except for winters ] , but after moving to San Francisco, which remains foggy mostly around the year , i needed a dryer. I simply love this one , and how quickly it dries my hair.  And also it leaves my hair soft and silky instead of dry and rough. I use the cold shot at the end to diffuse any static ions.</li>
    <li> This hair drying is decent nothing great. It almost feels a little cheap but it gets the job done. I kind of wish I had spent a little more money and got a better hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Received this in a timely manner.  I have curly hair and needed something with a diffuser that would stay on.  The chord frayed after 6 months of use about 3 times a week.  After I noticed the chord was melted I was irked!  This should have lasted well over a year!  Only buy if you want something for a few months.</li>
    <li> IM NOT AN EXPERT ON HOW TO USE A DIFFUSER,BUT I PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT WITH A LOT MORE EXPECTATIONS. THE BLOW DRYER ITSELF IS VERY CUTE AND STYLISH.BUT I DO LIKE IT</li>
    <li> a lightweight hairdryer that did a good job. however, cord often got tangled which was annoying and shorted out after only 5 months of use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m average height with average length arms…and this is the most awkward dryer ever. When attempting to use the diffuser attachment I can barely hold onto the handle, my arm is fully extended and it&#x27;s very uncomfortable. It&#x27;s lightweight - just too big.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the positive teviews here. I&#x27;ve been using mine for about 6 months now. I honestly don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s much better than a wall hair dryer in a hotel bathroom. Mine doesn&#x27;t get very hot, and it&#x27;s not very powerful. I find that it takes longer to dry my hair with this dryer than the old one k replaced that 10 years old. My hair seems frizzier than normal when I use this. Maybe I have a faulty unity.. But I would definitely not risk buying again. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Very nice, this is my first normal hair dryer, I normally buy one with a brush attached to it to straighten my hair because I have naturally curly hair I get the Infiniti Pro by Conair 3-in-1 Hair Styler, but I&#x27;ve been letting my hair dry without straightening it and just going with the curls, I decided to get this because my hairdresser uses this type with a diffuser on it when I get my hair done and it always looks better when its dried rather then air drying. So I gave this a try last night and it worked great, so happy I decided to break down and get one. Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> Light weight yet powerful...I absolutely love this little hand dryer it is what I have been looking for! ha ha</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t owned a hair dryer in 14 years but wanted to get it to help condition my hair....also when people come over to stay they often need one....right price and works great.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quiet hairdryer to replace my Conair 1875 watt dryer from walmart. I read the reviews here and most people were saying it is quiet or super quiet. After receiving the blow dryer, it just just was loud as my regular dryer. I was really dissappointed. I can&#x27;t believe so many people give false reviews here. The decibel meter was very high compared to my original. Wasted $20. Oh well, worth a try, going to keep searching for a quiet affordable hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Great powerful hairdryer for the price.  I actually still have mine from years ago and bought another for the guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. My old dryer would leave my naturally curly hair frizzy and awful when I&#x27;d blow it straight, but this is a great machine. My hair now shines with the combination of this dryer and Kiehl&#x27;s Smooth Silk Creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wasn&#x27;t a regular hair dryer user when I ordered this, it didn&#x27;t inconvenience me so much that this product took a little over a month to arrive. If you need this product, you&#x27;d probably be better off paying more plus shipping at Target than to buy from this vendor unless or until this vendor will address this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving this four stars is that it&#x27;s a great product. I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s reasonable to pan the product review just because of the service, so I only removed one star for the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy the product, be weary of shipping times from this source.</li>
    <li> Got this about a month ago and so far so good.  I was quite surprised at how light it was and it does blow dry my hair a tad faster than the one I had.  I have really long curly hair so to get my hair dry in less than 10 minutes is HUGE.  I haven&#x27;t used the diffuser yet, but I am happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> Compared to some of the other drugstore brand hairdryers out there, this one fails to meet my pretty high standards. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s an alright product for when you&#x27;re in a pinch and someone else is hogging the other dryer. I wouldn&#x27;t go for this on a daily basis though. Reason being that even when you&#x27;re on the high level, the air still comes out lackluster, medium-force, and it takes me a lot longer in drying my medium-length, thick-ish &#x27;do. I&#x27;m usually a sleeping in kind of girl, so I tend to rush in the mornings, and this just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. What I will give this props for is the verity of its claims in achieving \\&quot;ultimate shine, volume, and healthier looking styles\\&quot;. That&#x27;s the truth! My hair is softer, bouncier, and shinier as stated, it just takes awhile to get there with this Revlon product.</li>
    <li> This was delivered within just 2 days and it works fantastic!! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so light weight and handling is very easy. Has three settings for air, hot, warm and cool and then nicely working concentrator.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t use the other gadgets yet, hoe I &#x27;d have the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to any body! great for styling!</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and it usually takes a several minutes to dry. This dryer significantly cut my dry time. Lots of air movement and the ionic feature really works. I agree with one of the other reviewers who said the buttons were awkwardly placed (hence only four stars). There&#x27;s something not at an optimum there. Maybe if the on/off and temperature buttons were put in reverse order or moved so you didn&#x27;t accidentally click a button while you were using the dryer? The other suggestion would be to insulate the barrel. I like to hold it when drying the back and you can&#x27;t on this dryer as it gets way too hot. Still I love this dryer and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> It drys your hair fast!! But do not make your hair dry!! Amazing product for it price !! Love it！</li>
    <li> this works great for a blow dryer and was cheap. people think i spent tons of money on it and it looks really cool with all the attachments.</li>
    <li> I needed a hair dryer to use about once or twice a month. I found this at a great price with mostly good reviews so I decided to purchase it. I am transitioning to natural kinky/curly hair and have BSL hair overall. I almost always air dry so i needed something to dry it if I was ever in a hurry. What I was looking for was: at least 1875 Watt dryer, Ionic, Compact, With multiple attachments (at least comb, diffuser and concentrator), Not too loud. This dryer fills all those requirements... except for one thing: no comb-attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this came with two attachments, I planned to purchase the third one from Revlon. For those unaware, Revlon hair products are licensed to Helen of Troy. I contacted HoT to inquire about which model of comb would fit this dryer, since most comb attachments are expensive and I did not want to waste my money. They were very fast to respond but no one could tell me if there was one available that would fit. After a week, I received an email saying that they do not make a comb attachment that would fit this particular model. They said that this particular dryer has a specific nozzle so no other attachments from them, or other brands would fit it. I was disappointed, since nowhere in the package or description page does it say this. Perhaps I was naive to think that a company would never think not to make other attachments that would fit their best selling economy model, other than the standard out of the box ones. Now I have to think if this dryer was worth it at all. Who wants to buy a separate dryer just for that one extra task?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the product:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;lightweight, unbulky overall.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up considerably. Warm is an adequate setting for me, but it might be too hot for someone with very fine straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;2 attachments, including the concentrator.&lt;br /&gt;good value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Medium noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cord is too short. Does not rotate easily either.&lt;br /&gt;Verycheap plastic, i&#x27;m afraid this could melt with heavy prolonged use.&lt;br /&gt;Can only be used with the specific attachments that come with it (2), which are not for sale separately (If you contact Helen of Troy they might send you some for free if yours break)&lt;br /&gt;Diffuser is a joke. Not long enough for long hair to dry effectively. The fingers are too short and it&#x27;s not concave so the hot air just stays in the surface. People&#x27;s heads are nor flat, Revlon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;If you use your hair dryer very often, for long periods of time uninterrupted, this might die on you. If you use it very irregularly it&#x27;s a good balance between the price and use. If you want to use other attachments other than the ones that come with it, you might be out of luck. If you are purchasing this solely for the diffuser, I would stay away from this. Would I purchase this again if it broke down? No, I wouldn&#x27;t, but it will do for the time being.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer 6 months ago because it had great reviews. It worked great at first with zero problems. Unfortunately, it has started flickering off and on while I am using it. I read through some more reviews and noticed other people were having the same problem. Bummer.....</li>
    <li> After using an old one for 8 years, this is really nice.</li>
    <li> This is a report by the wife. She says...  Not as powerful as the Conair    She paid for it herself.  http://www.amazon.com/Infinity-Pro-Conair-1875-Dryer/dp/B006FLC09W/ref&#x3D;sr_1_sc_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1396142826&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3-spell&amp;keywords&#x3D;coinair+infinity+pro</li>
    <li> This is the most overrated product there is. This is a piece of junk. The first time I used it, there was burning smell coming from the dryer and then it stalled several times and I could not finish drying my hair. It happened on the  second and the third time I threw it away. I wasted my money on it.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. The first one lasted for years. It&#x27;s quiet, which is essential for me, and works great.</li>
    <li> I would give the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic Dryer SIX stars if it wouldn&#x27;t short out.  I&#x27;ve now owned three and each one shorted out when its cord melted at the handle.  This is really a great hair dryer with one big flaw.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, long brown hair. I always have issues with drying my hair. This dryer is fantastic. Does not fry my hair and dries super quick. First one I&#x27;ve found that I love!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works great for the price! I like the multiple heat and speed options, although they seem to be inconveniently placed on the handle... I keep unintentionally hitting the Hot to Warm switch in the middle of my drying session, so that&#x27;s why I docked a star.</li>
    <li> Really good! Does wonder for my hair. Feels a bit cheap when you touch it but it works great!</li>
    <li> A perfect hari dryer for thicker hair. I have very thick hair and it is very tough during winters to dry my hair. But this dryer does it all. very light in weight and easy to use. I also use it while travelling and as I said, it is very convenient to use.</li>
    <li> It works good. I like it. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful curling iron you should ever need.  Doesn&#x27;t even have to be as hot as other curling irons that I have used in the past.  Just delighted to have it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement to my John Frieda blow dryer my hubby bought me for X-mas two years ago. I noticed it starting to have a funny burning smell, so before I lit my head on fire I decided to buy a new one. Trying to be cost conscious I went with the Revlon RV544...Well, let&#x27;s just say the force at which the air comes out of the Revlon on the high setting is not even close to my John Frieda dryer. Usually I buy items on Amazon based on the reviews and a lot of people on here said this was a &amp;#34;strong dryer&amp;#34; with a lot of power. One guy one here said his wife has thick long hair and this cut the time in half...(Having a hard time believing this!) This dryer has NO POWER AT ALL, so if you are expecting to have a strong salon quality blow dryer Do Not Buy this Dryer. Then again, I guess I got what I paid for with a $20.00 dryer, My John Frieda was close to $50.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to break this down:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have short baby fine hair - great dyrer for you!&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair or long hair - look elsewhere!</li>
    <li> Average performance. The unit lasted eight months and died. As the unit was still under warranty, elected to return the unit for a refund and purchase another brand. It cost me $9.00 to return the unit as Revlon would not pay for return shipping. Given the $18.74 price and the $9.00 return shipping charge, would not purchase this product again and would not purchase another Revlon product.</li>
    <li> I have never felt compelled to leave a review before. This dryer is complete garbage, the plug in is slightly too small / narrow for regular wall sockets. I plugged it in anyway and a puff of smoke came out of the dryer. I will be returning this immediately.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer.  It dries quickly and the diffuser works great.  No complaints!!</li>
    <li> Does the job but the high is too high and the low is too low.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a blow dryer since my mom gave me one for christmas in 1984.  I was pretty surprised at how efficiently this thing works -- used with my new round brush, my hair dries so much faster than with my old blow dryer and I like the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feature.  Works great!</li>
    <li> shopped around for a reliable, daily-use dryer and this had the best reviews. Not surprisingly, when I received it, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. Great feel and heat control and all the attachments you need. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is great!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a new hairdryer in several years and was very happy with my purchase.  I found it to be lightweight and it left my hair with a very nice feel to it.  Not dry or frizzy.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer less than a year ago, using it every other day or so.  Loved it until this morning when it threw sparks at me and started crackling. I quickly pulled the plug but my bathroom still smells like something burning an hour later!  DANGEROUS!  I have two small burn marks on my skin from this.  I had a Jilbere for 8 years and it still works but I wanted to udate to a ceramic ionic model.  I looked at several options and fell for this deal based on the good reviews but mostly the low price.  So now my $20 Revlon dryer is in the garbage and I just pulled out my old Jilbere.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of those super expensive ionic hair dryers then did a little more research and good housekkeepping recomended this dryer for a better price. How about $110. dollars less and it does a great job. I have very thick wavey hair and this dryer cut my dry time in aprox. half plus it makes it super shiney. for the price it&#x27;s a great dryer. So I sent back the T3 I had ordered and got my money back.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer.  Ionic feature helps dry hair faster.  We prefer this dryer to all others we&#x27;ve recently used.  Air speeds and heat settings work for both of us.  Build quality is good.  Filter is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This dryer works well and I like the temperature settings. However, the volumizer attachment is worthless, it&#x27;s like rubbing a dinner plate on your head.</li>
    <li> Great purchase, inexpensive but dries my hair so quickly and I have long (6 inches past my shoulder) very thick hair!  Highly recommend.. better than my other blowdryers which cost $60-80!</li>
    <li> This product dries my hair much quicker than my previous hair dryer. The diffuser also works great and my hair does not feel dry.</li>
    <li> It works. It gets the job done. The back opens for cleaning...remember to clean it by flipping open the round black vent in the back- I gently use an old tooth brush to get the dust and hair that gets sucked in off the screen so it won&#x27;t burn out. I think the off switch is a little oddly placed in the middle of the rocker type switch. It works, it&#x27;s OK, you get what you pay for - I wanted a inexpensive blow dryer. I thought that maybe next time I&#x27;ll get one with a little more power, but with my fine hair it&#x27;s probably best to get only a tiny bit more power. UPDATE: it burned up at the cord/ handle area...what a disappointment, it was working quite nicely. I didn&#x27;t use it every day and it was well cared for. Lighter than average use, no abuse at all.</li>
    <li> researched many evals of hair dryers . this was the best value. gave as a gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought and returned a few hair dryers now in my quest for the perfect one for my hair, which is really good when i do a little work on it. My requirements are simple - ionic, tourmaline, powerful when you want and gentle when you want, reasonably sized and light weight. This dryer perfectly fit the bill, ended my long-lasting quest and finally I have MY hair dryer!    Update 4/19/11 - Three years have passed, my hair is now waist-length (beautiful, but more work) and this hair dryer still rocks! I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends and they&#x27;ve all loved it. I thought $30 was inexpensive (that was what I paid when I bought it) but friends have bought it for almost half that prize on Amazon during this period. It&#x27;s just awesome that you can get such a great product for such a low price. Seriously - go for it!</li>
    <li> This dryer works very well, but it isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;lightweight\\&quot; as one might expect it to be, considering that is the way it is advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser blah blah blah. I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s like an old man breathing on your hair to get it dry. I want power lots of it. yes disappointing. good for emergencies like your daughter trying to steal your good one any chance she gets.</li>
    <li> Excellent Seller!! Excellent Item!!</li>
    <li> Probably the best hair dryer I ever used.  Dries hair quickly and is lightweight</li>
    <li> My CHI hairdryer bit the dust after 7 years, so I bought this because it had great reviews and was cheaper.  This hair dryer is not good on my hair, I&#x27;m going to put it in my garage sale.  My hair feels very dry and looks frizzy after using this dryer and I never had that problem with the CHI.  Sorry, but I&#x27;ll spend the money now and get a good hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Bought this less than six month ago. Dead as a door nail.  I am disappointed as these generally last several year.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how to proceed from here.</li>
    <li> A great product but I wish I could fold it to be smaller</li>
    <li> Nice quality for the price. Light to hold</li>
    <li> Bought these for a vacation rental that we also use and liked it so much that I bought one for my own home when my old hairdryer died.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer! I have very thick unruly hair and this dryer dries it quickly!! Would purchase again...I&#x27;ve now had mine for 4 months and I&#x27;ve never had any issues with it.  Great purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> The hair dryer work fine the first two times I used it.  The third time, it was dead.  Thankfully, Amazon&#x27;s return policy covers this so I was not out the cost of the hair dryer.  Note:  This hair dryer has a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; feel to it.  Hard to describe, but it just doesn&#x27;t feel like a quality product when you are using it.  I would recommend spending a little more and getting a different brand.</li>
    <li> When working, it&#x27;s  a terrific dryer. I like the cool shot option. It does dry my fine, but thick shoulder length hair in about 7 mins. However, I have now gone through 2 of these in 2 years. I can not recommend. My other hair dryers lasted for 5-10 years. This one simply doesn&#x27;t hold up. Inside parts (the fan blade) crack and now I have high pitched wining noise, and smell of  burning plastic. The one before that had problem with heating coils, started to overheat constantly. Tossed that one worried about potential fire hazard.</li>
    <li> Best dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned! Great price too. (FUNNY? I just saw this very same dryer at Goodwill for $15.95!!! What are they thinking? Oh wait, they must know it&#x27;s a great dryer.)</li>
    <li> Who would&#x27;ve thunk it!!!! This $20 blow dryer is fantastic. Warm setting is actually warm...and stays warm. Can hold barrel with my hands. Diffuser is just the right size. Very high air flow. One review complains it went out after 10 months, who cares it was $20, I spend more than that on lunch most days.</li>
    <li> I need it a hair dryer when my professional hair salon hair dryer died (got it from a friend).  I got this dryer due to the overwhelming positive review from Amazon&#x27;s customers who had purchased this hair dryer.  The dryer is light and easy to use, and this is about it.  I don&#x27;t feel any difference between any other $20 hair dryer.  My main concern is that the motor is not powerful enough.  As for the build quality, it&#x27;s not as solid as the professional dryers.  I wish there is a store where I can go and try out all the hair dryers at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is really nice....👍</li>
    <li> Had this dryer for about 1 year, and all of a sudden it stopped working.  I reset it, and then it worked, but then it caught fire.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer worked great for a couple of years.  Then it started rattling very loudly when I turned it on.  After reading some of the reviews of sparking and fire, I am looking for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Editing in to mention that I wash my hair twice weekly and in the summer don&#x27;t always use the hair dryer so it wasn&#x27;t used daily by any means.</li>
    <li> I have owned a lot of hair dryers in my life trust me and this is without a doubt the BEST i have ever owned.  I have long hair and it dries my hair in half the time....i also have a huge static problem and def see a  difference after using this dryer.  Usually after drying my hair straignt i would have to go over it with my straigtening iron...with this dryer i do not have to do that, it leaves it so shiny! It saves me sooo much time in the morning! I cant comment on how long it lasts since i have only had it about 3 weeks...but even if it lasts me 6 months to a year who cares for 20 bucks! id go out and replace it in a heartbeat!  This is a def must have for everyone who uses a hairdryer!!!</li>
    <li> I had a little difficulty with the plugging in part due to the  adapter but once that was the resolved the dryer worked very well.  I was traveling in So Africa.</li>
    <li> Not as quiet as I&#x27;d hope but I guess well enough for a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> I did not think this blow dryer was anything special. It did NOT cut my blow dry time the way most reviews said I actually felt it took longer to blow dry my hair than with my old one. It also pulls my long hair through the vent in the back, which hurts.</li>
    <li> For the money, you cannot find a better hair dryer. Hot and warm heat settings and high and low dryer speeds are perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> It is not working after three months. I just used it like three or four times a week.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer for a great price.  This Revlon can hold its own with the much more expensive brands. My wife has a ton of curly hair and she loves how fast this dryer works.</li>
    <li> Dryer gets super hot and love that there are so many different settings depending on what I am trying to do. The attachments are great and is on the smaller size so it stores easily.</li>
    <li> Not very pleased with this product for one reason - the back end of the hair dryer does not have a good filter on the back - which has caused my very long hair to get caught/wrapped within the motor. My previous hair dryer&#x27;s have had a very fine filter to catch dust, hairspray, and I&#x27;m assuming long hair from entering the device. Not this one. I&#x27;ve had to cut sections of my hair off twice now. Definitely would not purchase this one again for this reason.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, dry hair very fast.</li>
    <li> This is my third 1875 Revlon hairdryer.  Why? Because I love them. They last maybe about 2-3 years for me before the motor blows and I replace it with the same.  Because for the price, it&#x27;s worth it to me.  I get great blowouts and the heat really sets my hair. The cool air blast is nice, especially if I am drying my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a couple of months now and so far it doing what its suppose to very well. It is a very good budget hairdryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great! Dries my hair quickly. Have been using it for a couple months now and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
    <li> I had the same dryer but this one seams to be less strong.</li>
    <li> not as strong as I wanted</li>
    <li> Good for the money i paid...</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t last very long (maybe 3-4 years) but I just keep rebuying this one.</li>
    <li> Nice, lightweight dryer. I love the diffuser attachment. Two complaints: (1) It&#x27;s ugly, and (2) Room temp setting (the little blue snowflake button) doesn&#x27;t lock, so if you don&#x27;t want warm/hot air, you have to keep your finger on it while you dry, which is pretty awkward. But I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this hair dryer twice and each time it only lasted for 2 months. Good while it lasted but something in the cord connection broke.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this. and she says this is really good. good product, with affordability.</li>
    <li> The Revlon RV544 Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  True to the advertisement it is very light and dries hair quickly.  All the positive reviews I read prior to the purchase helped me narrow down my choice.  I, also, recommend this dryer highly and would happily purchase it again when the time comes.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> I have been using conAir forever, but when the last one fried, I needed one fast. I got this because it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s highly recommended. I am not disappointed. I have long hair and a lot of it. The old dryers too  me 40 minutes and the bottom of my hair was still damp. This does the trick in 10 minutes with the condenser. I love it.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer has plenty of power with two fan speeds and 2 heat settings for flexibility. The unit is more noisy on high fan speed than I expected but the unit is does its job.</li>
    <li> I have had this blower for less than three months. I blow dry my medium length hair about 4 times per week. At first, this blower was great. Light weight and good setting. It is now having these strange power surges and smokes. I have tried it in different locations (home, work, gym) and the same surges happen so I know its not the outlet. I would not recommend this blower.</li>
    <li> My wife was more than happy to throw away her old dryer and pick up the new Revlon.  She tells me that it feels good to hold and does a good job.  I am impressed with the safety cut off attached to the AC cord.</li>
    <li> it is nice but it is a little bit big. may be next time I should buy a smaller one. anyway, this one is very useful</li>
    <li> I researched hairdryers on various sites and kept coming across this one.  I had my doubts as it is much lower priced than professional models.  But it delivers!  My hair is healthier and it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry my medium-length hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The dryer stopped working after less than two months of very light use.  A total waste of money - in this case, you really do get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Very glad I purchased this &amp; it works fabulous. It is lightweight &amp; easy to use. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Light weight, works well, plenty of hot air.  Tested for over 10 minutes and could still touch the barrel without being burned, just warm. Nice cord and easy to move buttons.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair that tends to frizz out when blow drying, with this dryer it takes only 3 minutes and my curls are soft and frizz free! Why spend more on another type when you can get the same results with this model?</li>
    <li> This blow dryer works great on my naturally curly hair! I use the diffuser and my hair looks smooth and soft all day. It also dries really fast and my hair looks shiny. Love it!</li>
    <li> My Chi dryer died after 7 years and I asked for a new one for Christmas.  My mother-in law saw all the great reviews on this dryer and got me one instead.  Well, Chi it ain&#x27;t.  First of all, it didn&#x27;t work properly and had to be returned.  It didn&#x27;t heat up at all.  Second, it just doesn&#x27;t have the balance or quality feel of a high end dryer.  If it worked, it might be ok for the guest bath, but I&#x27;ll stick to a professional dryer like a Chi or Babyliss for myself.</li>
    <li> Without much hair drier experience, this drier does the job, cheaply, without much fuss.  Buttons are accidentally hit, on occasion, as the only real downmark.</li>
    <li> What do you say about a blowdryer? It dries my hair. It&#x27;s lightweight. It&#x27;s not enormous. And my hair doesn&#x27;t smell like burning. That&#x27;s a definite plus. I used to walk around with my hair smelling slightly burnt from my old blowdryers. If my boyfriend hugged me and inevitably took a whiff of my hair, he was always looking puzzled. And now he doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the time it takes to dry my hair- meaning, it&#x27;s not a noticeably shorter duration of time, but it&#x27;s a great blowdryer and a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!!! It is super lightweight!! The best ive ever had!! Best diffuser also! Would highly recommend!!! :)</li>
    <li> great product, does what its supposed to, feel it is a good buy and good price. Has options for cool, warm and hot air and defusser, which is why I went with this dryer Also has high and low button, nice! Buy this one, well made and you will love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same blow dryer forever and thought it was time to get a new one. Love this dryer. Works quickly on my thick long hair!  Great price, works great!</li>
    <li> I had this dryer for a month and liked it.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that I kept accidentally shutting it off because of how the buttons are placed but put up with it.  Then after 1 month of use, it started blowing cold air and I returned it.</li>
    <li> Replaces another hair dryer that was 3X the price!  I have not had it long, but so far, so good!</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life? It dries my hair in half the time that it took my last hairdryer to do it. Looks great and is superlight in my hand.</li>
    <li> This has been the most helpful thing I have gotten all year. I have a kid whose hair is super curly. She is 4 so I had never used a blow dryer on her hair, as she has super dry hair, and I did not want to make it super frizzy. I started doing research on curly hair, and we started using these hair products called shea moisture, you can find on here but they are expensive. They sell them at walgreens for $10 cheaper. Also spraying her hair with water before brushing, to not rip the curls out, which happens if you brush it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, people were saying to use a tourmaline ionic blow dryer, and figured I would give it a try, and with the diffuser attachment its absolutely amazing! I can finally brush her hair in the middle of winter, and not worry about her getting sick from going outside with wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this blow dryer. It also reduces the static in my straight fine hair. Takes longer, but with the diffuser I don&#x27;t have a static head!</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap lightweight dryer.  I do not like anything about it :-( It does dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I just love this blow-dryer.  It does leave my hair feeling softer than my old one.  I have fine/thin hair and am happy with this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any problems pushing the wrong buttons or pushing buttons accidentally as reported in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light and drys fast on the warm setting.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this dryer in the beginning.  It&#x27;s pretty fast, lightweight, and had a great attachment for my curly hair.  Last week it started tweaking out on me and would completely shut off.  I played with the filter (not the issue), and finally realized it was the cord connection between the cord and the base of the dryer.  I have been able to limp through my morning routine by finding an exact pressure and cord location that the dryer likes and trying to use it that way.  It&#x27;s awful! So, now unfortunately, I&#x27;m shopping for a new dryer.  All I can figure is it is from the cord being wrapped around the dryer during storage? It&#x27;s only 2 years or so old, so I&#x27;m pretty bummed. In all honesty, if you plan on replacing a dryer every 2 years anyway, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one, if you&#x27;re looking for a keeper though...keep looking.</li>
    <li> works great, light weight and comes with tools</li>
    <li> My wife and I used this hair dryer daily for just over a year and we were pleased.  Now it turns off unless I hold it a certain way, suggesting a wiring problem.  Good while it lasted, but twenty bucks a year is a bit much for hot air.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Really lacks power. The directional tool pops off way too easily.</li>
    <li> I was actually looking for another hairdryer when I came across this one and the excellent reviews.  I have very thick hair, although not long.  Finding a hairdryer that dried quick was what I wanted.  This product does a great job and I only used it on low.  My hairdresser said there is a problem with the Ionic dryers in that they can burn your hair, so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in two days, the box was damaged on the outside but the dryer was in good condition.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is too loud and really doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of power when it blows your hair. After a year of use, it&#x27;s about to die. Gave it two stars -- it was below average, but not entirely a piece of junk. (Close, though.)</li>
    <li> Works wonders for curls using the diffuser.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is really good. Dry so fast, i love it... It is really cheap... I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer my hair drys in mins</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and powerful blow dryer. The feature that sets it apart for me is the ability to remove the rear vent and clear out hair and dust that gathers over time. Being able to clean it will greatly extend its life.</li>
    <li> So far so good--seems to have all features and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this around five years ago. It still runs but I think too much hair may have been sucked inside over the years. It is making a loud noise. My only complaint would be that high heat is too hot and the low just doesn&#x27;t cut it. In between would have been perfect.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. Dries my hair quickly and isn&#x27;t too heavy or noisy</li>
    <li> Fastest drying hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. Light weight so it&#x27;s not uncomfortable to hold. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is a nice light hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Pretty quiet and easy to maneuver.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was a little larger than I had expected. And not as quite as i had hoped but it is better than the one I was using.</li>
    <li> Great dryer but shorted out while my daughter was holding it. A little frightening.</li>
    <li> Lasts about a year, but it&#x27;s pretty quiet and cheap enough that I bought another one.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new hair dryer and after reading all the reviews I decided to purchase this one.  It is awesome.  It cut my hair drying time in half. It has multiple het settings including a cols air setting.  Love this hair dryer!</li>
    <li> I really am disturbed about this dryer.Not quiet at all.It does not compare to my conaire at all.</li>
    <li> I brought this dryer back in Feb 2014. It was a great dryer for over a year.  Unfortunately last month (June 2015), sparks started coming out of the dryer. My daughter who is 17 years old almost burnt her fingers.</li>
    <li> Absolute JUNK , keep looking lasted two months read the other one star and two star reviews,waste of money</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a hair blower in at least 20 years.  So, I&#x27;m not sure how these &amp;#34;stack up&amp;#34; against more expensive blowers.  I can say that the diffuser fits snugly and securely (which is more than I can say for other models blowers - from reading the reviews), it is lightweight, comfortable to use, and dried my VERY thick VERY long hair (even with the diffuser) very VERY quickly.  That&#x27;s a lot of &amp;#34;verys&amp;#34;. So, for just over $20....I&#x27;m thrilled :-)</li>
    <li> best one used ever.. dries hair very quickly..</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hair stylist as I was having a hard time with my new very short haircut. This was easier because of power which made drying quick, and hair looked full and curly which is what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I chose this hairdryer because of the reviews, it was great for the price.  Now it takes me half the time to dry my long wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Not as quiet as I&#x27;d hoped, but still lots quieter than the last beast I had.  Wish the &amp;#34;COOL&amp;#34; button could be kept on vs. held down.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer ever.  I am now on my 3rd one, will not change to anything else and just delighted that Relvon still make the 1875W</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my sister. she loved it! she said it was an excellent styling tool. can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted, much quieter than my other Revlon. I only buy this brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this a month ago, and I love that it is relatively quiet and dries my hair quickly (shoulder length, thick hair - usually about 20minutes or so). I usually use it on the warm and low setting (high if I need my hair to dry more quickly) and it doesn&#x27;t feel too hot at all. I think it is a great deal, it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive ($19.99) and fulfills its main function.</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price.</li>
    <li> Dry my hair in less time and not heavy at all. The best hair dryer I has found. Hope revlon keep it in the market forever.</li>
    <li> Works great on my massively thick wavy hair.</li>
    <li> My co worker and I both purchased this hair dryer. We both swear it does dry faster and less frizz on our hair. My daughter and I have long thick hair and it works great for us.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer worked great for about 360 days. I didn&#x27;t honestly think it was any better or worse than any other hairdryer of similar style. However, as other users have noted since my purchase, it caught on fire two days ago. To do a warranty exchange (it is covered for two years - but you have to pay to ship it back) you have to call:    Helen of Troy  1-800-487-7273</li>
    <li> The dryer is lightweight enough, despite its size. Normally, I like a smaller dryer, but this one works well on my hair. It is much more quite than my former folding travel dryer. The handle stays cool to the touch. Nice for the Price.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer!  The one I had finally died after a couple years.  I went back to using an old hairdryer I had laying around as a &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.  I couldn&#x27;t handle it.  I HAD to get another of these dryers!  Never an issue with this product and it dries my thick curly hair so quickly and without friz!</li>
    <li> This unit does not have a cool air option - only low or high heat settings(which is my reason for a 4 star rather than 5).  Works well and dries my hair quickly.  A little noisy but most blow dryers are to some degree.  Better price here on Amazon than I have been able to find in local retail stores.</li>
    <li> Good but clumsy to use due to buttons/dials.  Does a great job in drying my hair quickly.  Wish it were more ergonomically correct.</li>
    <li> I gifted this to my wife.  She is pretty happy with this so far. Works well.&lt;br /&gt;She had been using it regularly on her keratin treated heirs.</li>
    <li> Great product! has cut down my dry time and I love how many attachments it came with.  I can also tell that my hair looks so much shiner after using this product!</li>
    <li> Works very nicely. It&#x27;s lightness surely does not relate to its significant value. Gift for my significant other. No complaints.</li>
    <li> it is a great product. love how fast it dries my hair, and the attachments make it fun and useful</li>
    <li> this dryer seemed great at first. light weight, pretty powerful--and i have some ling thick Italian/greek hair ( i now realize though, this really wasn&#x27;t that great at drying my hair like i thought).  But in less than a year and half it started making a loud noise and i think i may have occasionally seen sparks inside (or perhaps that&#x27;s just the ionic power?) When i tried to repair the dryer i couldn&#x27;t even get it pried open. I hate that our society is a throw away one. I figured the motor/fan just had some hair in it that i could take out. But no luck. Guess i have to throw this one away. The hairdryer i had before this lasted me over 6-7 years. Can&#x27;t believe this didn&#x27;t even make it a year and half. I&#x27;m really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that being said the new dryer i just bought is a dream and actually dries my hair--spend a little bit more and you won&#x27;t be disappointed:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JSL6QI/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;purchased april 2013</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy with this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s too lightweight.  The ON/OFF switch is not designed well as I keep accidently turning it off when drying my hair.  I don&#x27;t know why, but it takes all the volume out of my hair.  I have not changed any hair products or brushes.  Maybe the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; feature is the reason.  Would not recommend if you want volume.</li>
    <li> Neither great nor bad</li>
    <li> After so many positive reviews I was very disappointed in the level of heat. Its warm but not hot enough to style with. The diffuser works very well and I will only use it for that and on my kids who need less heat.</li>
    <li> As a male who never used one in the past, until my new stylist suggest it, it does everything I&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> It is a little light... does&#x27;t feel like you are holding a $100 Dryer but then again you aren&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that aside this bad boy gets the job done with a cold air button and high/low speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this on the market there is absolutely no reason to spend any more money on a hair dryer... unless they are throwing in a free car... Then get the other dryer.</li>
    <li> Love the diffuser accessory.  Works well...just like I expected it to.  This hair dryer replaced the same make and model I&#x27;ve been using for the past few years that is worn out.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter that has frizzy hair to help calm it.  It makes a Hugh difference in her hair, it is alot shinery, less frizz, looks healthier.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Revlon 1875 from maybe 10 years ago.  It actually still worked but the on/off switch was starting to hesitate, so it was time to go.  This dryer is similar, and has good air flow, but it&#x27;s HOT.  It has a low and high, I use the low but constantly have to push the blue button which cools it down.  I&#x27;ve used it and won&#x27;t return it at this point, it&#x27;s hard to buy a dryer without trying it first, but my preference would be one that low is warm and high is hot.</li>
    <li> I have CRAZY thick hair that typically takes forever to dry. This hairdryer gets it bone dry in about 5 mins. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Light weight and not too loud. The low temp. could be less powerful to avois drying too quickly. This is a dry climate so a little dryer goes a long way and this one works well as long as you use conservatively.</li>
    <li> It worked on the high setting only once and then would not even turn on at the high setting. Low was to low to even dry my short, thin hair. This is junk.</li>
    <li> Yes, it will dry your hair.  But I cannot recommend this dryer.  The buttons are poorly designed.  They are small and poorly located.  Whenever trying to use this thing, it&#x27;s very easy to flick the buttons accidentally.  It&#x27;s very easy to turn this thing off accidentally.  Actually, I accidentally turn this thing off very frequently when trying to dry my child&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s a nuisance.  But again, that being said, it will dry your hair and won&#x27;t break your wallet, so two-stars.</li>
    <li> This dryer literally pressed my hair quick dry using the ionic ceramic brush</li>
    <li> Dries my hair so quickly!</li>
    <li> This product works well thus far.  I do wish that it would get a bit hotter, but otherwise it has been good. Also, the attachments don&#x27;t always stay secure on the product, so they will fall off at times while blowdrying your hair.</li>
    <li> Omg i love it so much ! It&#x27;s so light! My hair are really long and thick, so its tacking me some time to dry my hair , so i needed a good one and light! I m so happy with this hair dryer! I love it! It comes with accessories as on the picture.</li>
    <li> Loving this hairdryer, I have short hair and it took me less than 3 minutes to get my entire hair dry and maybe another 5 minutes to style :D</li>
    <li> This blowdryer is so light it feels like it&#x27;s going to fly out of my hand! I have very thick hair, so it can take a while to dry fully, but this dryer is nice because it doesn&#x27;t make my arm sore when holding it.</li>
    <li> The unit is noisy when used on high setting, which I kind of expected because the amount of air it blows out, but it sure dries my family&#x27;s hair a lot quicker than before.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have had it for about a month now and use it almost every day. I have wavy hair and it has always been hard for me to blow dry my hair. I use the diffuser and it dries my hair beautifully and within about 5 minutes! And I have very long hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, great price!  Had the same hair dryer model before.  It lasted for several years before the chord shorted out.</li>
    <li> My daughter says this product is holding up well despite the daily use.  Maintains temperature well.  Waiting to hear how it&#x27;s working in the next 6 months.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend is happy and so am I. She says it works fine so now she can stop complaining about my cheap hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this dryer for years and never had a problem. It works perfectly. I have long hair and it dries it quickly. I use it mainly for the diffuser attachment because it is better than any other diffuser I&#x27;ve used. Gives me big voluminous curls when I use it on gelled hair.</li>
    <li> This dryer lives up to its promises -- it dries my medium-length, thick hair in under five minutes.  It&#x27;s lightweight and the nozzle doesn&#x27;t get hot like my old dryer.  And the price was very affordable.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For the price, it stands up against the expensive dryers!  It&#x27;s light weight, dries my hair fast and leaves it shiny.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a great hair dryer.  There is a design flaw that because of how annoying it is, I&#x27;ve taken off 2 stars.  I had this hairdryer and when it finally died, I immediately ordered a new one.  The new one has temp and air select buttons that toggle back and forth as opposed to the older model that we would push up and down for heat and air.  Believe it or not, it makes all the difference in the world.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times during drying my hair that just by switching hands to do one side of my hair or the other, in doing so, the heat temperature toggles down from hot to warm.  This happens, of course, because the switches are located directly where our fingers grab the handle.  When it had switches, I&#x27;d have to consciously slide the switch up or down.  With the toggles, it happens accidentally all the time.  I need the temp to be on hot because I have curly hair and the heat dries it on the straighter side for me.  Warm temp causes my hair to not dry completely and tends to frizz.  So I am always on the alert to keep an eye on the heat selection as I&#x27;m drying my hair.  An unnecessary step as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  It wasn&#x27;t an improvement, but rather an impediment.  It&#x27;s really too bad.  It was a great dryer.  Now that the second one has conked out, I&#x27;m making sure I check the kinds of switches that are on any I am considering buying.</li>
    <li> my wife loves this thing! it was a Christmas present and she still finds new ways she can do her hair! perfect price, easy to use</li>
    <li> It is really a good dryer, powerful and not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it’s a little heavy compared with the one I had before, but this one dries faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS BLOW DRYER BECAUSE I HAVE SLIGHT CTS AND MY BLOW DRYER WAS VERY HEAVY FOR ME. WHEN I GOT THE REVLON RV544, IT WAS SO LIGHT I THOUGHT, OH NO, THIS IS NOT GOING TO DRY MY HAIR. I HAVE FULL THICK CURLY/WAVY MEDIUM LENGTH HAIR. AMAZINGLY IT DIDN&#x27;T ONLY DRY MY HAIR BUT IT TOOK ME HALF THE TIME THAN MY OLD BLOW DRYER! THE DIFFUSER IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really great, good help to make my hair dry and useful for making a style, and it&#x27;s not expensive</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer just 4 months ago and it has already stopped working and will not turn on.  Poor quality...</li>
    <li> Basically, I can say - &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a hair dryer&amp;#34; .  I don&#x27;t notice that it adds anything particular to volume or shine to my hair and can only say it is priced reasonably and serves the purpose.  I would not necessarily recommend it to anyone seeking extra volume and shine.</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer. But its definitely not that light weight I hardly could use other attachment. In all meets the expectation</li>
    <li> As someone who washes and styles her hair on a daily basis, I have always paid outrageous prices for hair dryers that were advertised as &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;the best one on the market.&amp;#34; (thinking that if a professional beautician used the product for heavy duty daily use, it would surely meet my non-professional needs)  This usually resulted in my spending in the $150 - $200 dollar range.&lt;br /&gt;These dryers, universally, were sleek and HEAVY.  Most lasted, however, no more than a year.  Last month, when my lasted model started smoking, necessitating shopping for a new model, I called my beautician and put in an order for a model which would have cost approximately $170.00.  Happily there was a delay in getting that dryer and I shopped on the Amazon site for a quick replacement.&lt;br /&gt;  To my total surprise, I read the reviews for the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer and decided that since it was S0-O-O inexpensive, I would give it a try.  AMAZINGLY, it is light, powerful and totally wonderful!!  It does everything as advertised (truly unusual these days) and even if I have to replace it more often, it is so reasonably priced that I can have a new one every few months for the prices I was paying for those I have used over the years.  I am truly a VERY HAPPY CAMPER!!!</li>
    <li> Revlon RV544PKF 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer was a great bargain price and my daughter was excited to get it as a gift!</li>
    <li> Powerful and lightweight. Dries my thin, straight hair well, but I wish the buttons were designed slightly differently ... a few times I&#x27;ve accidentally turned off the device mid-drying because my fingers hit the on-off button.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I had a similar model from Revlon for the last 30 + years! It was great, this model has a bit less power. I thought the wattage listed relative to the wattage on my old dryer would be good. I recommend going for a model with a bit more power. But the quality seems to be there.</li>
    <li> This revlon hair dryer is the best one I have ever bought. It is so light weight and durable but also has tremendous power and does the job quickly. I love the multi attachment as it helps diffuse the drying process while straightening as well.</li>
    <li> If you want to add volume to your hair DO NOT buy this hair dryer.  The ionic aspect does not have a switch that you can turn off.  So it makes my fine hair very flat.</li>
    <li> This is a very lightweight, economical blow dryer that does a very efficient job of drying my hair. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> After reading so many good reviews, I ordered Revlon Tourmeline. It did dry hair quickly. But it is broken less than 3 month after my initial purchase. The customer service is friendly. They asked me to mail that back and they will mail me a new one. They don&#x27;t even cover for the postage.</li>
    <li> This dryer does a good job, fast. I wish that it was a bit smaller but I guess that you wouldn&#x27;t get the same power with a smaller one.</li>
    <li> Bought for my girlfriend and she loves it. The device does it job well and costs little money - a good deal.</li>
    <li> It works just fine, all 3 pieces were in the box. I also use it with the diffuser on the dog after giving her a bath. It&#x27;s nice and warm (don&#x27;t use a hot hair dryer on a dog) I keep moving it on her and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Used for almost a month&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with this, remains its power and heat. Love this one!</li>
    <li> Stopped working after one week</li>
    <li> Poor quality! Did not work at all! Had to go through hassle of returning the product. Guess the &amp;#34;product quality&amp;#34; went to the drain...</li>
    <li> Drys fast and its not too loud, I just wish it had a maybe retractable cord?! But other then thst very nice</li>
    <li> Went with my ex.  Ask her</li>
    <li> I had a more expensive one previously but this one works way better. Quick to dry hair on a busy morning and have an option to switch to warm hair which I use all the time as I am very sensitive to too much heat. It&#x27;s also not as heavy was my old one. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer to replace one that retails for $150 which lasted less than a year. Rather than opting for replacement  under warranty of my old product (which involves inconvenience, cost and a considerable waiting time for relacement) I chose instead to try this Revlon model based on the many strong reviews. I can&#x27;t say enough about this dryer! It is light weight and quiet. I have very fine hair and have not encountered the problems w/ styling mentioned in other reviews. The controls seem conveniently and strategically placed, in fact almost identical to my old CHI. My daughter, who has thick hair, has also found the Revlon be an excellent product.</li>
    <li> A couple months after purchase, the cord to the hair dryer needed to be positioned in a certain position for the hair dryer to work. Now, less than 5 months later (of using it several minutes a day 3-5 days a week), the hair dryer is completely useless. Something is broken inside the hair dryer that connects the cord to the hair dryer, as it only works if the cord is held tightly with upward force into the hair dryer. Not worth the money and now I am left without a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I had read some reviews on the the noise it generates and decided to purchase it anyway. The noise is not too bad and is actually lower than some of the more expensive ones that I have tried before.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has the tourmaline and ionic features that are usually found in much more expensive units.  This Revlon dryer is a nice, solid weight, but not so heavy you arm gets tired.  My wife says it works great.  I am bald, so all I need is a towel, but for those of you still burdened with hair, this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> This dye comes so highly recommended on Amazon.com that I decided to try it. Too bad I threw away the box before using it! This dryer has doubled my hair drying time from 30 minutes to a little over an hour. Yup. The diffuser attachment traps most of the air which makes it useless of you are a curly and need the diffuser. A complete waste of money. I&#x27;m still looking for a hair dryer that can get the job done in less than half an hour.  This one is not it!</li>
    <li> Good heat and I really appreciate that it&#x27;s lightweight.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t even had this for a  year ... I bought this in June 2014. A couple of days ago it stopped working consistently -- if I tilt the dryer a certain way it shuts off while the power is still on. I&#x27;ve tried with multiple outlets with the same result. Sparks also come off while I&#x27;m using it which is definitely a safety hazard .. It was a great product up until now.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe it...I had the older model but still very expensive T3 ...this outperforms the T3!  It&#x27;s light, and I&lt;br /&gt;really do see a difference in the condition of my hair..it is def silkier and drying time was less than with the pricey T3!&lt;br /&gt; Love it</li>
    <li> The buttons are positioned oddly so I keep shutting the dryer off when holding it…other than that it works well and does not spark like my prior one so I don&#x27;t worry about setting my head on fire….</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for nearly 3 years. In that time, almost half of the silver paint has flaked off the handle and nozzle.  I had to do a paint check of my hair after each use so it didn&#x27;t look like I had silver dandruff.  Even though the buttons are down the anterior side of the handle I find that if you use your left hand, you will repeatedly change your settings or turn off the unit all together.  The unit gets super hot, that can be a plus or a minus - depending on your hair type. I have fine hair, so this dryer burns and fries my hair.  The positive is that is is very light.  Check my other reviews, I recently replaced this Revlon with a Conair that is superior in every regard except weight</li>
    <li> This blowdryer works pretty good, not the best. I&#x27;ve used better ones, but it does what I need so I&#x27;m not going to complain. Could probably get a better one for the price I paid for this.</li>
    <li> My Hair dryer also stopped working. Some kind of short in the cord. After a few months it goes on and off. I&#x27;m throwing it away before mine blows up like the other comments!!!  Terrible product!!</li>
    <li> Over the course of many years we&#x27;ve gone through many different blow dryers.  For a long time I scoffed at the idea of there being any difference for this thing called ionic, until I tried it.  There is a very noticeable difference.  It makes the air coming through the blow dryer much cleaner feeling.  I know this may seem strange, but it works.  It means that your hair dries faster with less static.  This is all we buy anymore for replacements.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works for me.  Dryer my hair to perfection. The airflow is to my liking and the two heat setting are good for drying and finishing.  I didn&#x27;t think it was too loud and family members and guests sleeping while I dry my hair haven&#x27;t complained.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> for $11.00 as an amazon open box...i almost couldnt go wrong...works perfect....much, much better than my old dryer...</li>
    <li> Just got this to replace my T3 that my daughter accidentally dropped in the toilet.  My husband had gotten me the T3 as a gift, but I didn&#x27;t want to shell out that kind of money again unless absolutely necessary.  So I&#x27;m trying this much cheaper but well reviewed alternative.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but so far drying time is relatively fast (maybe takes 4-5 more minutes than the T3) and the result is a nice smooth blowout.  So seems like a good value.  My hair is long, curly, but not very thick, just for reference.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair dry so far. I have noticed the difference when using this one compared to my old hair dryer, my hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy and it does appear to have a little more shine, love the diffuser also</li>
    <li> Dries hair. Has a warm and a hot setting, I prefer the warm since it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. Comes with one of those big round things that I never really know what to do with.</li>
    <li> One of the things I had to buy to use that 3M window insulating stuff.  I don&#x27;t use this to dry my hair.  So after doing 5 windows and a sliding door it sits unused.  ( I can not recommend the 3M product, too many other leaks in my house to save me any money on the heating bills )</li>
    <li> i just got this today. i needed a second dryer for overnights and my first one is the&lt;br /&gt;Bio-Ionic iDry Nano-i5X Nano-Ionic Conditioning Pro Dryer which i love but didn&#x27;t want to pay the same amount for another dryer. So i decided to go with revlon and it is amazing so far!! it drys really quickly and my curls look great! i was afraid that i would get a low quality dryer but i think i like this one more! hopefully it lasts me!</li>
    <li> great value for the price - would buy again</li>
    <li> Still holding strong after about a year. I haven&#x27;t seen as much breakage and my hair has plenty of bounce once finished blow drying.</li>
    <li> By no means is it the most powerful hairdryer, but it works really well for me.  Love that is comes with styling caps!</li>
    <li> Current version does not have a hanging loop. The hair dryer might work well, but I have now received two defective dryers in a row, broken right out of the box. I have serious doubts about the build quality or reliability.</li>
    <li> Bought this soley for the diffuser. Works great. Def recommend</li>
    <li> Great value! I have super fine, long hair down to the middle of my back and this dries it quickly and makes it look shiny</li>
    <li> My hairdryer had just gone out so I ordered this one on a whim. It&#x27;s great! Some hairdryers have that high pitch, ear-piercing buzz (my mom had one and she had to wear earplugs while she dried her hair) but this one doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not too loud and very lightweight. It dries my hair incredibly fast compared to my last one. I have very fine hair but lots of it and usually have a problem with frizz but this leaves my hair fairly smooth. I would definitely recommend this product, at least for the same hair type as mine. I haven&#x27;t tried the attachments yet but I can tell they are made with better quality than the last one I had.</li>
    <li> use easy，dry fast，good choice</li>
    <li> Dry hair very quickly</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a loud old hair dryer.  Sadly, this new dryer advertised as quiet was much louder than the old one. I&#x27;ll keep looking and avoid Revlon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer since October 2014 and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. It&#x27;s a cheap hair dryer at a great price. I think this is one of the best cheap hair dryers. My hair usually frizzes when I blow dry my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t frizz when I use this hair dryer. I don&#x27;t constantly use it every day, probably at least 1-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I like that this hairdryer is light and manageable, and I LOVE how it makes my hair smooth and shiny.  It seems quieter than my old dryer, and definitely dries my hair quickly.  No downside here!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this a few months now. Quieter than my other one, enough so to call it quiet. Heats up quickly too. Great price and I like the built-in gfi plug.</li>
    <li> Quiet and hasn&#x27;t blown out on me yet and I&#x27;ve had it for months! Love it!</li>
    <li> At first, I was skeptical about buying a hair dryer online.  After looking at hair dryers in various stores, I really couldn&#x27;t find one that I liked.  I took a chance and found this one on Amazon.com.  The very first time I plugged it in, heard it, and felt the nice warm air coming out of it, I knew I found the right one!  It is very much like a salon hair dryer and it dries my hair much faster than any other hair dryer I have owned.  I have very thick hair so that tells you something about how well this hair dryer does the job.  I highly recommend that you look no further and purchase this item right away.  You will be very happy with it.  I am hopeful that this hair dryer will last a long time.  If you dry your hair regularly, this one is for you.  I will possibly update this review if this item does not last or any problems arise, but I am not anticipating any problems at this time.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> It has options for warm and heat which is beyond my expectation, and good to use. It will be perfect if it&#x27;s a little smaller and lighter. Too professinal for family usage:p</li>
    <li> The product i received was damaged but it&#x27;s still functional. May be it was damaged in transportation. But worth buying it. No complaints about the functionality but the one I got damaged in shipping.</li>
    <li> Exactly was I needed.. Attachments are great and the dryer is really easy to handle</li>
    <li> It is really good hair dryer. I mean this is what i expect. It works correctly, it&#x27;s a lot of protection and tells you to put away from water i mean you have like 100 pages of explanation about that. How to turn on....all that stuff. I&#x27;m really satisfied and i will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Works great and the one I had before lasted 6 years!</li>
    <li> Regular product. Arrived ontime.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer in  Sept 2014. It worked well but just a couple of days it just stopped working. I did use most days but I thought it would last more than 6 months.</li>
    <li> Getting ready in the morning has been so quick now that I can dry my hair in under 5 minutes!! Who knew I would love a hair drier.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine, thin below shoulder greying hair that is getting the menopausal straw texture.  Frizzing easily and dull with no shine.  So I did some research and found out ceramic (not ionic) is what would be good for my hair type.  And I wanted a really quiet dryer for the few times I use it.  I generally run out of the house with wet hair and let it air dry during my commute, but I was wanting to get more lift at the crown and a dryer with conditioner seemed the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer frizzes my hair just like any other dryer.  I don&#x27;t see any difference.  It&#x27;s a little bit quieter, but it&#x27;s not all that light.  It&#x27;s hard on my arthritic wrists.  The cord needs to be at least 2&#x27; longer to reach to where I can stand in front of my 3 door mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a very good dryer if they had a decent length cord, lost a lot of weight, and had included a switch for European travel.  I find I&#x27;m not using it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t agree with the hype.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer!  Very strong flow, not too heavy, and the hook holds it well!  Only wish the defuser was flexible like others I have seen.  It would make for easier storage.  Overall thought...great product and great value!!!</li>
    <li> Super lightweight and great output options. Diffuser works great as well. Highly recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> Finally! A solid hairdryer that is hot enough to dry my thick, wavy hair faster than the other dryers I&#x27;ve tried. Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Did not have this dryer very long before it started making a rattling noise like something was loose inside. Afraid to use it.</li>
    <li> Stopped working in 1.5 years</li>
    <li> this makes my hair dry. funny cause i didnt buy it for that reason. lol. im a dude this makes my hair dry. good price. im happy with it.</li>
    <li> ***MODIFIED REVIEW****&lt;br /&gt;After 9 months, the dryer bit the dust.  The cord at the base of the dryer frayed.  I loved it while it lasted, but it certainly long enough.  Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through 2 driers in the last year.  Both were ionic and were so heavy.  One would not allow me to hold dryer to my hair without overheating and cutting off.  This is a compact and light alternative.  I have straight long hair-so not much styling is involved.  I need a quick blow dry.  This does the trick and takes me only 5 minutes to get hair dry.  In addition, the size makes storage very easy.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these we have bought.  The first one lasted about two years, then the on/off button wore out.  We liked it so we bought this one.  Exactly 360 days later, this one crapped out as well.  Revlon... I&#x27;m just not that into you.</li>
    <li> Good overall product for the price. I doubt does tourmaline make any difference. Quick dryer, easy to handle light weight.</li>
    <li> bought one for my mom and then one for me ... works perfectly fine .... i would order more if i needed too :) thank you. oh and its about a couple months old and it hasnt broke or anything :)</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Almost 1 year ago to the day this blow dryer started making crazy noises. There was not smokey smell, so I kept using it for a week or so (I only blow dry my bangs every morning, I do not blow dry all of my hair). This morning it made a loud popping noise and I smelled smoke so I immediately turned it off. I&#x27;ve heard of other issues like this happening with other Revlon models. The last blow dryer I had lasted for almost 10 years! This one didn&#x27;t even make it over a year. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be new... It&#x27;s definitely not. The box was open and torn, the cord was shoved sloppily back into the box, along with the attachments. It&#x27;s very cheaply made. And worst of all, it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m contacting Amazon to return the hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this hair dryer. It is very lightweight and does not take too much time or leave too much frizz. It is comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> Works as expected but not as quiet as I would like.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very long.</li>
    <li> Brilliant hairdryer - lightweight, fast-drying. I have ordered another one for my mother today! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> what can I say it drys my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very light, very fast drying my hair type. Long wavy hair</li>
    <li> So far so good! Nice lightweight body. Simple controls. I enjoy the two attachmnets. A brand I trust and have purchased before.</li>
    <li> Nice dryer but it stopped working after 7 months due to a short in the cord.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 8 months ago, and it stopped working properly after three or four months, no longer running at full power. I was thinking about buying a new one because of that, but was holding off because I haven&#x27;t had it that long. Tonight it started popping and smoking while I was using it, and while I watched, things inside caught fire and more smoke started pouring out if it. I quickly unplugged it and thought I was going to have to use a fire extinguisher to put it out, but fortunately once it was unplugged the smoke and such died down. I will be buying something else to replace it. Having it fail on me so quickly was bad enough, but this kind of fire hazard is a whole new level of bad!</li>
    <li> The best thing about this hair dryer is that it is very lightweight as stated.  The next best thing is that it does a nice job drying hair quickly.  I have LOTS of long hair and it&#x27;s the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve had so far.  Would say I&#x27;d buy again, but I bought 3 of them for each bathroom.  Sometimes you find a product you like so well you want a backup just in case ... this is one of those products.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a product that would dry my long-ish and thick-ish hair fast, without too much damage, bought this one relying on the reviews, and could say it is not bad.  Does the drying job fast enough.  The hair seems shinier then before.</li>
    <li> Dryer is good, seems to dry fast without damage. Good for pets.  Huge size, even without the attachments, makes it difficult to use or pack. Will need to get travel sized one.</li>
    <li> nice hair dryer, I don&#x27;t feel that my scalp is on fire, as I did with the previous...haven&#x27;t used the attachments, it works just fine for me</li>
    <li> If I remember correctly it doesn&#x27;t say the voltage on device, and the plug has a fuse on it which leads you to believe it&#x27;s duel voltage. However, when I plugged it into a socket in Hong Kong, it literally Exploded. Dumped in the trash, totally useless. Fuse went up in flames and I didn&#x27;t have the ability to replace the plug at the time to see if I could get it to work again. Might have been a good dryer otherwise, despite being quite large and plastic feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: works on 110 volts, if you only have 110 volt outlets and never travel that&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: no voltage switching &#x3D; plug it into a 220 volt socket and your outlet is going to go up like a flash bang weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well as a hair dryer before I went traveling. I wish they would have had a warning considering how common dual voltage is these days. I have similar products and travel a lot and this is the FIRST and only product I&#x27;ve ever had a problem with. I&#x27;ve never had anything go up in flames like this. Considering how much I travel I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it had I known.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked it down to 3 stars because I really feel like it should have stated the voltage clearly, or that it was not dual voltage. it would have saved me from purchasing this, or at least accidentally destroy it, which could have potentially caused damage to my apartment as well. Although it otherwise may be a capable dryer, there is no way I can rate this highly because I see this as a huge lack of over-site and dangerous flaw for electronics these days. I ultimately had to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, this might seem trivial if you live in the US and never left the country but it will be a show stopper for some.</li>
    <li> Fast and powerful, dries your hair really well and quickly. You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price that you pay.</li>
    <li> I have bought 2 of these hair dryers because I loved it so much and thought the first one died by a fluke. It wasn&#x27;t. While it&#x27;s working this is a great, light-weight, lower noise hair dryer. Unfortunately, after less than a year both started flickering on and off when held at certain angles, and just got worse with continued use. This time I&#x27;m not waiting for it to get worse- I&#x27;m getting something different.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It is very user-friendly and better than I expected. I use the diffuser attachments a lot and they work well.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a light weight hair dryer... this dryer was way inexpensive, very light weight, and has the technology I was looking for.  Everyone should buy this dryer... At ~$20, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer but today (after purchasing 8 months ago) the hot/warm settings are not working properly - it&#x27;s blowing cold to lukewarm air but still working.  I wanted to return it, but have passed the return period on this item so I guess I will buy another one and hope it lasts longer next time.  It&#x27;s worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> I liked the hairdryer but it broke after 5 months of use. I only use it 2-3 times a week, so I was surprised it broke so quickly.</li>
    <li> Purchased from amazon a year ago and my wife still loves it.  Way faster than anything else out there at this price.  Does the same thing as a $100-$200 product.  No need to spend that money when this product does everything they do.</li>
    <li> The Diffuser &amp; Concentrator Attachments do not fit for the hair dry. It is really bad product. I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer has worked well.  Use it daily.  Wish it had just a little more power, but happy with it.</li>
    <li> My wife did open it as soon as i get home, she tried with her friend using the diffuser that comes in the pack, and she is just more than happy, she said she love it, the package arrived in very good condition. Awesemo product she said, so recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy I&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent beauty tool! I have a difficult hair and this .  Help so much!</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer!!  With the multiple settings, you can dry your hair like you&#x27;re in the salon.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your hair until it&#x27;s brittle feeling.  Great dryer and the delivery was very timely.</li>
    <li> Works well as expected. I never use the attachments. The price is good for this basic tool.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! I went on Amazon with my stylist and we picked it out together, I am definitely happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Incredible difference in results from a regular dryer.  This makes my hair very sleek, silky and smooth.  Get the kind of blow-out your hair dresser gives you.  Dries hair in about half the time.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The perfect price, easy use!  Love this dryer.  Quick dry for short hair, works for my daughters long hair, doesn&#x27;t scare my two year old granddaughter when I use it on her.</li>
    <li> Nice and light...great price for a basic Dryer. Works great with no issues and a nice deal you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since I upgraded to this Revlon hairdryer from Conair ionic shine 1875 and I&#x27;m LOVING it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I should have bought this sooner!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- very lightweight as advertised!!&lt;br /&gt;- fairly quiet compared to my old Conair ionic shine 1875&lt;br /&gt;- flip switches for temperature (Hot and warm) and power (High, low and off)--I love this because it&#x27;s easy to switch to different settings with one finger while blow drying my hair!&lt;br /&gt;- hold down button for cool shot&lt;br /&gt;- blue light when ionic function is working&lt;br /&gt;- I find \\&quot;Warm\\&quot; setting hot enough to dry my hair without burning my scalp (and it does so fairly quickly)&lt;br /&gt;- my hair is obviously softer, straighter and tangle free&lt;br /&gt;- static and frizz free&lt;br /&gt;- cord does not tangle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- not \\&quot;foldable\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;- cord does not retract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my review helps!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer was nice enough while it lasted.  It was small and lighweight, and did a good job of drying my hair quickly and without frizz.  But I bought it on January 10th of this year, and here it is April and it&#x27;s already dead.  If it had even lasted a year, it might have been worth the price...but three months?  I&#x27;ll never be buying one of these again.</li>
    <li> Other Customer reviews helped me buy this for my wife and she is very pleased! I Think if you want an inexpensive Hair Dryer That acts like an expensive one than this is a good try! Although the test of time is still out as it was a recent purchase. We are pleased!</li>
    <li> Very good dryer and easy to uses. It&#x27;s lightweight and very powerful with great features like ionic. Perfect for everyday use and  not too big for travel.</li>
    <li> Bought the Revlon RV544PKF 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer for $16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has decent power and comes with 2 heat/speed settings. Have used only few times and so far it seems to hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will come back and post as I use this more often.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dryer mainly because it is very light. I didn&#x27;t notice that it dried my hair any faster or that my hair was shinier.</li>
    <li> This is just the dryer I wanted. It is quiet, powerful and very lightweight. My old dryer was literally burning up. My hair was so hot it was burning my fingers. This is a great replacement and the price was perfect. It is a great value.</li>
    <li> My previous dryer was over 10 years old and just wouldn&#x27;t die. So even though it still worked, I bought this one based on the great reviews. And it was a great dryer while it lasted. Light to hold, dried my hair fast, not very loud. It&#x27;s all but dead 2 years later. The wiring has split right up by the dryer and I have to spark it to make it run and then hold the cord in an exact position. I didn&#x27;t let the cord get twisted, didn&#x27;t wrap the cord and with short hair, it was gently used. I&#x27;m on here looking for a new dryer but it won&#x27;t be this one.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer, works like a charm</li>
    <li> This dryer lasted exactly 2 months before it started smoking and sparking while using. Not safe.</li>
    <li> first time, I worried about wind power..but it is great windy warmy dryer...it hasn&#x27;t cool button, only warm and hot button,,,but that&#x27;s okidoi....a big circle stuff helps to dry hair fast</li>
    <li> Long lasting hair dryer</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.  It really does dry your hair faster if you have really thick hair that takes forever to dry.</li>
    <li> I love this small hair dryer. I&#x27;ve had it for a month or so now and it still works great. The only problem is that after only one month, when the dryer gets hot, it starts to smell, which worries me a little. The performance hasn&#x27;t changed, though. The attachments fit great and do not fall off at random. I wish EVERY hair dryer fitted attachments the way this one does! Dries my fine, but plentiful hair fairly quickly. This has been mostly on par with the expensive hair dryers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a back-up to my existing drier of the same model...&lt;br /&gt;Cuts my drying time considerably, love it:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for a little over a month and so far I like it more than any other ones I&#x27;ve had. I have a ton of long hair and it normally takes a long while to dry it, tiring out my arm in the process. But this Revlon works quite a bit faster than any others I&#x27;ve used and is pretty lightweight too. My only complaint is the hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft or sleek once dry as other hair dryers I&#x27;ve used and my hair is still pretty frizzy. Hair serum helps with the friziness but none of the settings seem to give me the softness/sleekness I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it scored so well with Consumer Reports, they got it right, it is a great purchase</li>
    <li> It drys my hair super quickly, which is awesome. I have thick curly hair, so if I dry it fully, even with the diffuser, it is pretty frizzy like all hair dryers for me. So I only dry it 3/4 or I use it before flat ironing. I am still happy I got it!</li>
    <li> It works great. Easy to dry my hair, and easy to carry. Although I kinda can&#x27;t figured out what the big round thing works for. There should have been a more specific description on the manual.</li>
    <li> I give 3 stars because the wind is a little bit weak and kind of overheat.  Besides there is no button for constant coldwind unless you keep pressing the blue botton. Just ok as it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> Good but much bigger than I thought</li>
    <li> Gets super hot, but doesn&#x27;t have much power. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Wow.  It&#x27;s been awhile since I had a new hairdryer... but this one is really fantastic.  At first I thought no way this is going to work the air flow seemed kind of weak compared to my old hairdryer... but It dried my hair SUPER fast with the diffuser on, and I have very thick hair that normally takes forever to dry.  Love the cold shot.  I like that it has a warm and hot setting.  This has everything I need and more.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this for a month now and no regrets. It’s light weight, easy to use and does its job. Only thing I could say I don’t care for is that the bigger attachment is difficult to take off, I almost feel like I’m going to break the attachment or blow dryer because of the force needed to pop it off. But the smaller attachment pops on and off with ease.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer and it works great. I had a plain ol dryer that died and I replaced with this. I do notice my hair dries more quickly.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with Seller and Product</li>
    <li> nice hairdryer that heats well and does everything as expected</li>
    <li> performs as expected, has held up, and was purchased at a good price - say no more!</li>
    <li> Purchased April 2014, Died October 2014.  Six months of once-a-day use and it craps out.  Not completely mind you, but it cuts/shorts out for random periods of time throughout the drying process rendering it mostly useless.  Thank goodness for the 24-month warranty, which sucks by the way.  I can buy this hairdryer for $21 and change, but have to pre-pay shipping to return the defective unit to Revlon AND include $5 for shipping/handling of a new unit back to me.  So after another $12, I&#x27;m out a total of $33 to wait weeks to get yet another &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; hairdryer that will hopefully last......how long??  Pathetic how a multi-million dollar company nickel and dimes customers to replace a cheap Chinese product.  I did the right thing and bought something else this time.  Goodbye Revlon.</li>
    <li> Good dryer - I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only had mine for 6 months and the power cord wont supply power.  Very unhappy to have to buy a new blow dryer already.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair and this blow dryer gets my hair helps in the straightening process. It has different settings - hot and warm, low and high - for those who don&#x27;t want a lot of heat on their hair. This is an excellent value and works as well as an expensive blowdryer.</li>
    <li> Drys my full head full of curly hair pretty quickly. I used this hair dryer one day and my mom&#x27;s (a different brand) another and my mother&#x27;s hair dryer took about 5 minutes longer to get fully dry. Just be careful how close you get the air intake on the back to your head, as with all hair dryers. It sucked in a few strands of hair that had to be ripped out in order to free myself from it. I really must stop singing in the mirror so much and pay more attention to what I am doing. Despite my mishap I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> bought for wife - within 2 minutes on high heat it shut done. Packed it up and it goes back... Price is great but lacks performance</li>
    <li> blow dryer is light and powerful drying time is pretty quick.</li>
    <li> This dryer completely stopped working after only 2 months after I purchased it, and I did not even use it daily.  Wasted money.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping from Amazon. Item was brand new. It worked smoothly out of the box. Its air flow is strong. Its heater is a little weak compare to expensive model but it beat all the others for this price. It was a bit noisy but acceptable.</li>
    <li> Having read all the reviews about this product, I deceided to purchase it. It is as decribed and works very well. It is quiet on low speed and powerful on high. As our last Conair only lasted just over two years, we&#x27;ll see how this one holds up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do anything with a hairdryer except dry my hair (meaning I don&#x27;t use it to \\&quot;style\\&quot; my hair).  This hairdryer does dry hair.  It&#x27;s not as lightweight as you might think (which is why I bought it).  It&#x27;s really kind of bulky.  Also, the buttons are too easy to push and located right where you hold the thing, so I&#x27;m constantly turning the dryer off when I&#x27;m using it..... annoying.  I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain too much about a product that didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
    <li> I got this blowdryer to replace another one I had for a few years. At $20 and pretty good reviews, it was a hard bargain to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer gets the job done. It dried my hair faster than my old dryer and I like that it comes with the two attachment pieces, though that seems to come standard nowadays with any dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only comment is that the shape and placement of the buttons are slightly inconvenient. It&#x27;s smack in the middle of where you&#x27;d hold the blowdryer, and since they are just big push buttons, it&#x27;s very easy to accidentally change settings in the middle of using it. I use this dryer at least 3 times a week and, in the month that I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve accident turned it off or switched a setting almost every time I&#x27;ve used it. But let&#x27;s face it -- when you&#x27;re paying $20 for a blowdryer, you are getting it because it&#x27;s good at its job and are not expecting any extra bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the price! Fast drying, not too heavy, love the attachments for my curly hair.  Try it now.</li>
    <li> I bought this and a T3 at the same time due to recommendations.  The T3 was poorly made and didn&#x27;t perform as well as the Revlon!  The T3 is in a drawer and I use the Revlon every day.  At 1/3 the price, this one is clearly the winner.</li>
    <li> Cant tell if its fake or not... the tags on the cord were all messy and didnt look professionally done. But it made my hair very smooth, and worked pretty fast. Honestly, it makes me nervous using it because of the possibility of it being fake (most likely is) and I&#x27;ve heard some pretty scary stories. But you know what, you get what you pay for! My fault.</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I needed a quick replacement for a hairdryer that suddenly started smelling like its innards were burning. I&#x27;ve always just bought whatever was on sale and seemed to have the best box description in the store, but decided to be a little more discerning about it this time, since the last two hairdryers I&#x27;ve owned have resulted in smoke/burning smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this one dries my hair any faster than the others or damages it any less, but I do like that it&#x27;s very lightweight (would probably be great for someone with arthritis in her wrist) and has all the normal buttons and options that you would expect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this dryer twice now, so I will definitely update this if my thoughts change.  At this point, I love this dryer.  I have a lot of hair, it holds a lot of water, and it is wiry &amp; frizzy when I don&#x27;t style it.  My previous dryer was pretty old...probably 10 years old.  It eventually got the job done.  This has been eye-opening!  It easily took half the drying time with this new Revlon.  On high, it has a very strong blast of air and it quickly got my hair dry.  On high it is hard to style with a brush, so I mostly finger dry.  My hair definitely feels softer and smoother.  I used to air dry most of the time b/c I felt like it was less stress on my color-treated hair.  Not anymore - my hair looks and feels better when I use this dryer.  I do have to use a flat iron after drying it, but that&#x27;s just a fact I&#x27;ve accepted in life.  Definitely recommend it for people with thick hair and/or frizz.  It is a longer nozzle than my previous dryer so I&#x27;ve whacked myself in the head a few times.  It will just take some getting used to.</li>
    <li> It does not come with a diffuser, or at least mine didn&#x27;t. Part of the reason that I bought this blow dryer was for a diffuser.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than, expected, UPS went above &amp; beyond &amp; loved the ability to track the purchase. We had a lot of snow, so it was good to see what delays might be coming up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is lightweight &amp; has variable setting. High/low speeds &amp; high/low heap, plus a specific button to have a rapid cool. The only thing that would spoil the rating would be if it stops working anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money I was impressed.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer doesnt have much power and it seems like its already about to break down..&lt;br /&gt;Maybe i got a bad one..? I dont know.. I might want my money back ..</li>
    <li> I like this blow dryer.  My only complaint is that I wished it would blow harder.  (yeah..haha)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high setting is more like the medium on my previous dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works great.</li>
    <li> This dryer has great power, and dries my hair in record time. It leaves my hair feeling soft, and looking shiny.&lt;br /&gt;However, for me -- I have fine hair. I dry my hair by flipping it upside down because it gives my hair more bounce and body. For some reason, when I use this dryer my hair stays really limp and I don&#x27;t get the lift and body I used to get from my old hair dryer. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll need to find another dryer that can give me that same look.</li>
    <li> works great, my family likes it. Good price also. it blows air and the handle feels good so it is worth it :)</li>
    <li> Perfect product and shipped fast</li>
    <li> I was shocked to discover how much a hair dryer cost at my local chain drugstore.  Of course I hadn&#x27;t purchased one in over 20 years, so there is that to consider.  This one is great!  The hot setting is hot enough to bake off the styling product that I use so my hair doesn&#x27;t look crunchy all day.  The diffuser attachment is really nice and fits securely on the end of the nozzle.  I&#x27;m not expecting that it will last as long as my last one, but for the money I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled.</li>
    <li> The Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic dryer is great. I was impressed with how quickly it dries my hair. Very convenient to have. Great product.</li>
    <li> While is works it is pretty good. The heat is just enough to dry my hair quickly without frying it. Trouble is, it doens&#x27;t last very long... one year after I bought it, it overheated and broke.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is a good, solid dryer at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strong enough to dry hair quickly and has two settings so you don&#x27;t get too hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid construction, blows well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve oly really used this dryer for my practical exam. Left the manniquen hair super soft and smooth w/o the use of prodcucts. It gets really hot and the cool button is efficient. I think it&#x27;s a great at home dryer and for entry level stylist work! Thanks</li>
    <li> For tourmaline, ceramic, AND ionic, you can&#x27;t beat this hair dryer. It has all the settings I need, great air speed, gets nice and hot without burning, and is reliable. After my first one quit 3.5 years after I got it, I shopped around a bit and bought the exact same one again. That&#x27;s a testimonial if nothing else.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is really light weight and it really needs to be with the different attachments that you can interchange. I use the biggest one that is designed to reduce static and poofiness. It works great, give it that it takes longer to dry your hair because the air flow is less concentrated with the attachment on, but it really adds a nice feel to your hair once it&#x27;s dry-feels like you just walked out of the beauty parlor.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the hot setting on my hair.., but my husband has used it to thaw a frozen pipe, and I used it to thaw a frozen door lock.  As far as hair, dries great with less frizzing than other dryers</li>
    <li> Great price for a good hair dryer! Comes with two attachments and has enough power for everyday use. Recommended buy!</li>
    <li> this little device is amazing for its price... I have curly hair and absolutely love it. dries my hair so quickly</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer mainly for the diffuser, but got so much more. It&#x27;s dries quickly and it&#x27;s super light, although with the diffuser it&#x27;s not exactly &amp;#34;travel friendly&amp;#34; but you adapt because it&#x27;s so effective. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It works fine.  It&#x27;s just a little larger than I was expecting.  I would get it again for the low price.&lt;br /&gt;  BW</li>
    <li> Just like my title says, I love, love, love this hairdryer.  I have had one before, this is my second.  The first one I had seemed to have a wiring issue in the end.  Towards the end of it&#x27;s &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; whenever I would move the hairdryer, it would somehow stop working and then go back on.  Seemed a bit dangerous so I threw it out and ordered another one.  The first one lasted a year and a half.  But, being that I spent only twenty bucks on the first one and now only sixteen bucks on the second, the price is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this hairdryer is that when it dries it seems to separate the locks of hair making my layers look shiny and pretty.  Yes, I said SHINY with pretty layers.  While I was waiting for the second hair dryer, I used an old one I had and the old one took a very long time to dry my hair and my hair looked like a rats nest and very dry when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sixteen bucks you will definately see a difference in your hair.</li>
    <li> I love love love this dryer! I have blond, overprocessed, long, fine hair and this dryer leaves it so smooth! I can&#x27;t believe it! It dries my hair in five minutes, compared to twenty minutes with my old dragon dryer (you know the one, practically spits fire and weighs a ton!).  This does blow fast, even on low, but that is the great thing about it! The dryer is so LIGHT! 14.8 ounces to be exact! I just can&#x27;t tell you enough about why I love it! The shipping was free, and the price was half what it is in the store.  If you have fragile hair, this is for you. If you have thick hair, this is for you. If you have frizzy hair, fine hair, any hair.. well you get the idea!</li>
    <li> I grew up with straight to wavy hair and until a few years ago my hair just became curlier on it&#x27;s own and I had no idea how to control it. I kept reading about diffusers and how it helps with naturally curly hair, so after years of using a regular blow dryer, I decided to buy this and all I can say is WOW. Not only is it a good product over all, the diffuser attachment it amazing! I wish I could have had this years ago, it would have reduced a lot of bad hair days. The price is unbeatable, and it is lightweight.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this blow dryer so far. I stopped going to a hair stylist because it started to become expensive and started doing my own hair. But some of my products required heat and I was not impressed with other reviews for box hair dryers or hair dryers you literally pay an arm and a leg for. So I did some research and found a hair bonnet to attach to a blow dryer and this is the best dryer I have ever had and it gets the job done. It drys my hair super fast, an hour and thirty minutes to be precise. I used to use a box hair dryer and those things took the entire day to dry my hair and then it still was not dry. This dryer is perfect. It is high powered, its fast, super hot (a little too hot but that is okay). All I can say is that it is perfect. I do not ask for much and this dryer does not give me anything extra except the capability to dry my hair fast. And that is what I love about it. And it does not hurt that it is not an expensive dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer was a great price and arrived on time in safe packaging.  We haven&#x27;t used it yet, so I&#x27;ll get back on once I have more feedback.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a small gift for my wife. It is more quiet than most, and has the &#x27;right&#x27; heat settings which can often be too hot.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who absolutely loved this product. The volumizing finger diffuser attachment removes tangles in the hair while drying it. The concentrator works amazingly well on the scalp. The drying happens very quickly!</li>
    <li> Been looking for a lightweight for a long time, and I have very thick hair, this dried it in half the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace the Revlon RV484 Ion 1875 Watt Hair Dryer, which died by electrical surge. This one is serviceable. I have thick, curly hair, and I don&#x27;t like the diffuser that comes with it at all. The holes are too large, compared to other diffusers, and made my hair very frizzy. I bought a revlon diffuser attachment instead (Revlon RV480 Professional Ceramic Universal Finger Diffuser). That diffuser fit just fine on the original dryer (the RV484) but after a minute or so of using it with the RV544, it would shoot off - smacking me in the head, and usually scaring the crap out of me. It&#x27;s an annoying problem, but one that I can usually deal with, once I realized that this mostly only happens when using the &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; setting (on low - I only ever use the low setting anyway). So I use this dryer on Warm, Low, and my diffuser might pop off once or twice in the 15 minutes of drying, and I can deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has stick-straight, thin hair (the opposite of mine) and I really, really like the straightening attachment for her hair.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t last me very long so I eventually bit the bullet and bought a pricer alternative which I am very happy with.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace similar model that broke. Works great and good value. Would buy again. I recommend this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I got this hair dryer a few weeks ago because I wanted one with a concentrator, which this one does have, but it melted after the first use. I have a lot of hair and I think the plastic bit melted because I put it right against the hair and my round brush, so while it is still usable the quality is lacking. Other than that it is a good dryer it is pretty quiet and dries my hair quickly.</li>
    <li> Performs perfectly for an excellent price. Silver finish is nothing to get excited about, kindof dull and unimpressive, but this dryer delivers on performance. Plenty of features for every need.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my wife, who has long thick hair.  She needs a quality hair dryer and this has measured up in all regards. Good value too.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. Good value and the weight is not too heavy to make you feel like you&#x27;ve had a workout after drying your hair. I have long hair and that is important. Looks nice and the attachment/difuser is a nice bonus too. I&#x27;ve used it and it works awesomely.</li>
    <li> The product was just what I was looking for, light weight, quick drying, and high air flow.  The service to order and ship to me was superb and the value was outstanding.  Hard to beat that combination!</li>
    <li> The item was described exactly as it came and was on time.  I love it.  It was a great buy.</li>
    <li> It is light and fast dry.  Good product</li>
    <li> Works well and delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> Works great and great price. Got my hair accidentally stuck in the back even though there&#x27;s a cover so you have to be careful. There&#x27;s an annoying hair burning smell for a while after that.</li>
    <li> this hairdryer started off great-it&#x27;s very lightweight and did a good job. however, over the last 2 weeks i couldn&#x27;t use it at all on the lower setting without it turning itself off.  then this week i can&#x27;t dry my hair at all without the motor shutting off.  i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve had this for even a year, and i am extremely disappointed that this happened.  the motor started going on my previous dryer, and being at least 3 or 4 years old, it made sense.  this, as a replacement, did not even last a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unrelatedly to hair but relating to revlon, their nail polish sucks. my polish is brand new, yet after waiting for my nails to dry, the polish smudges and smooshes.  i tell you this so you can steer clear of this brand, as i will be doing from this point on.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product. I hate buying blow dryers because they are so expensive! But this is everything I needed. I use the diffuser tool more often than anything else and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Very powerfull and good price</li>
    <li> The dryer works very well.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the on/off switch.  It is a rocker switch instead of a slider and is easy, for me anyway, to turn the dryer off by mistake.</li>
    <li> Great dryer for my wife and daughter with thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE!!!! Just caught on fire today and I&#x27;ve only had it for 6 months. The Conair dryer I replaced with this piece of junk was 16 years old when it finally bit the dust!! Shipping costs to get a replacement are almost as much as the price of this flamethrower!!! Just do yourself a favor and stay away from Revlon.</li>
    <li> She still uses it. It must be good. Good gift for friends or loved ones who you buy countless of gifts for but they never seemed to ever be use....</li>
    <li> Purchased for sister who wanted a quiet hair dryer.  Hopefully this will live up to her expectations.</li>
    <li> Sound very loud, in China use note plug power strip in the country can not be used.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick, very long hair.  After reading the reviews, I was anxious to see if this cut my drying time at all.  It usually takes me 40 minutes to get it completely and thoroughly dry or else my hair will frizz up.  I&#x27;ve seen no difference in other standard hair dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as prior ones I&#x27;ve bought within the same price range.  It does leave my hair sleek and smooth, however.</li>
    <li> Had it for about a year and yesterday It blew up in my hand! I don&#x27;t not recommend!!</li>
    <li> So far so good! It blows really hot air, really fast.  My hair dries in less than 10m. Love it!</li>
    <li> I don’t buy into the whole ion ceramic thing when it comes to hair dryers. Sure it makes sense with the hair straighteners but not the hair dryer. But anyhoo, I love this because I want a hair dryer that when I put it on max it will blow a Chihuahua across the room. If I want my hair dry in ten minutes, I want a dryer that will blast it dry. This has low and high settings and high is high. Very good.</li>
    <li> Just bought it for Christmas to replace my old one and it seems to work great!  I would highly recommend buying this hair dryer, it has two different speeds and settings and is pretty lightweight.</li>
    <li> Awesome! It&#x27;s super hot and also lightweight. Good purchase</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first used this dryer.  I had been used to loud, powerful dryers and this one isnt that.  Its more quiet and didn&#x27;t *appear* to have the oomph.  I was proven wrong.  After a few days of adjusting, I realized my long hair was drying just as quickly.  No issues at all, love this product.</li>
    <li> This dryer works very well! I am surprised because the price is so cheap and works better than the dryer i bought at the salon and it costed me $90 dollars. It makes my hair smooth, soft and shine! I love it!!</li>
    <li> Typical hair dryer. Works great for the price. I&#x27;ve had other tourmaline hair dryers, and this one works the same at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> pro: its light, drys hair really really fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con: umm i  guess my dog hates the noise. oh and cord is a little short&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall: if i needed another some day i would buy again</li>
    <li> Dryer works great for my hair.  It is not the best I have ever used but for the price it is good.  I have very thick long hair and usually takes forever to dry.  So I needed a dryer and it does the job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this dryer daily for the past two weeks.  I bought it to replace a 10 year old Revlon dryer that still worked, but I wanted one with a diffuser.  The biggest difference is how lightweight this dryer is, which makes it very easy to hold.  The diffuser seems to work as it should but it takes a bit of an effort to switch the attachments on and off.  I have shoulder length fine hair with bangs and there is actually more power than I need for my bangs but my hair ends up looking ok despite the tornado-ish force.  I knocked off one star because of the design of the heat and speed controls.  My old Revlon dryer had switches that you had to intentionally move.  This dryer&#x27;s switches are too easily changed by accident.  It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but a minor inconvenience.  Overall, I like the dryer and it was worth the price that I paid.    Updated, December 2014: After using this dryer once a day for about a year and a half, it suddenly developed a high pitched whine when on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting. Cleaned it, unplugged and restarted it, and it still happened.  Made it uncomfortable to use so I bought a new hair dryer.  I had hoped it would last longer.</li>
    <li> i have waist long asian hair. i used not to dry my hair, cause it take too long time almost 30mins, and dry my skin before the hair dry. so i was looking for a light weight and quick dryer, after i read all those reviews i decided to buy this one. and yesterday i got it, try it right away, just 10 mins, my hair dry, unbelievable. now i love to dry my hair, haha.</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Light weight, switch is in appropriate position. Dry fast.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product for the price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> Just a quick side note - this hairdryer is great and I like that the sound is more muted than most.. BUT!  The on/off and hot/warm switches are exactly where your fingers go when holding this and I find myself turning the dang thing off by accident, at least twice every time I use it.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is awesome love it.</li>
    <li> Have had this dryer for 11 months.  Yesterday it blew up in my wife&#x27;s hand, giving her some pretty nice burns.  (See attached photo)</li>
    <li> LOUD -- and takes quite awhile to dry my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is my very first review on Amazon and I buy ALOT of things on here!!  But, this blow dryer blew me away!! Ha ha, see what I did there!!  I&#x27;ve owned several different blow dryers but when my last one died, I had to get this one based on the reviews.  This is the cheapest but absolute best blow dryer I&#x27;ve had!  I&#x27;ve owned it for about a month now and cannot believe how fast it dries my hair.  I have very thick long hair and it has literally cut down my blow dry time in half!!  I will definitely buy this one again!!</li>
    <li> I like this dryer a lot. The whole family does. It definitely dries faster than previous ones. We only wish it had a longer cord. (Our previous dryer was a &amp;#34;professional, salon&amp;#34; dryer with a verrrrrrrry long cord and we loved that aspect.)</li>
    <li> I think this dryer would be fantastic for someone hoping to blow their hair out straight and shiny. On high the force of the fan is strong and the heat is hot. Unfortunately, when the fan speed is set to low, even on hot the dryer puts out much, much less heat. On warm and low there is barely any heat at all! I have curly hair, and I don&#x27;t want a forceful fan speed. I want heat with very little air. With my old dryer, I used the diffuser with the heat level on high and the fan speed on low, and my hair dried. This dryer takes forever to dry with the same settings. It dries well on high and hot, but even with the diffuser, those levels create too much blowing air to hold my curl without frizz. It&#x27;s a shame. My search for a new dryer continues.</li>
    <li> Weak sauce!  This dryer doesn&#x27;t blow :)  I would skip this one and go with the dryer I bought my daughter at the same time the Infiniti Pro by Conair 1875 Watt Salon Performance Folding Handle Hair Dryer.&lt;br /&gt;It is fabulous!!</li>
    <li> The dryer initially worked well.  However it died 6 months later and I cannot get my money back or a replacement from Amazon.  Wil not purchase Revlon products as they already took enough of my money.</li>
    <li> has stopped working  ... only used about 10 times max .</li>
    <li> I ONLY NEEDED IT FOR COLD WEATHER TO SEAL 3-M TYPE WINDOW INSULATION KITS AROUND DRAFTY WINDOWS OR MAYBE HELP PEEL OFF A STICKY TAG ON A ITEM.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife.  We use it all the time.  Used for hair, defogging mirrors, drying nail polish, drying facial masks, and it never fails.  Easy to operate and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this based off a tutorial i saw on pinterest about getting nice curly hair. One tool i would need would be a diffuser, which my current blow dryer didn&#x27;t have. This blow dryer is nice, it has a hot/warm switch, as well as a high/off/medium switch and a cool button, which is great for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the diffuser part of the hair dryer at this point, I haven&#x27;t even used the dryer without the diffuser yet, but i will update with that once I have, and this is why i have only given it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, with prolonged use, the diffuser part does get rather hot, which may be a problem for some people, and i&#x27;m talking like 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Its a wonderful hair dryer! I like how you can even add a cold shot to your hair. Both the attachments fit nice ans snug.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this dryer!</li>
    <li> very smooth and efficient.  the sound level is good and it works great.</li>
    <li> in comparison to other hair dryers that i have purchased for wife, this quality is extremely cheap, the attachments are difficult to remove as well</li>
    <li> Dries hair fast! But I thought it was smaller in size, however, it is lightweight. The only issue I will have is when travelling. I wish the handle folded or it was smaller in size. Otherwise it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have as much air put out as our last one but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair dryer, dries my short hair in no time, quiet as well.  NO problems.</li>
    <li> Nice hairdryer. No problems!</li>
    <li> I love it! Why didn&#x27;t I know it was possible for a blow dryer to dry my hair so quickly sooner! I feel like up until now, I&#x27;ve been wasting so much time drying my hair with regular blow dryers! This one is awesome!!</li>
    <li> Loved this hair dryer for the past 2 years, and then this morning it shot a large spark out at me and shorted out.  Dropped it like a hot potato, promptly unplugged it and trashed it.  Why isn&#x27;t this thing recalled?</li>
    <li> Not such a great buy. First one didn&#x27;t even work once I plugged it in right out of the box. Amazon great at replacement, and second one works. I&#x27;ll keep this as a spare, but it isn&#x27;t anything I&#x27;d use daily. There are far superior products out there</li>
    <li> This is a good blow dryer. I wish it had more air pressure. It doesn&#x27;t blow as strong as I thought it would. I have very thick hair and its long so it&#x27;s takes a long time to blow dry. But overall is a good blow dryer.</li>
    <li> It was good while it lasted.  It stopped working exactly one year from purchase date.  It was very hot and dried my hair fast.  I&#x27;ve purchased cheaper hair dryers that lasted 5 or so years.  I won&#x27;t be buying anymore Revlon hair products.</li>
    <li> Great product for a fair price! I have VERY thick curls and needed a blowdryer with a diffuser that dries my hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t frizz out my hair very much, that was lightweight enough for me to travel with and suited my student budget. I got exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Attachments STAY on!&lt;br /&gt;- Super lightweight&lt;br /&gt;- Dries really thick hair rather quickly without frizzing so much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Cord does not retract&lt;br /&gt;- Can get a little slippery if you hand is covered in product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is SO thick, I have to dry it in separate sections, so it takes longer than your average head of hair, but I&#x27;m still very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> only works with 110 wats</li>
    <li> Love this! Dries my hair pretty fast.</li>
    <li> A ceramic blower that does justice to your hair. Great for all types and styles. Dries your precious locks quickly without it exploding in your face during prolonged usage.</li>
    <li> My hair dries very quickly.  I have used one like this before and find it for the price equal to more expensive dryers.</li>
    <li> LOVED this dryer when I got it and continued to use for two years. Plugged it in yesterday and it blew sparks out the back and no longer works. Great for the two years I had, just wish it would have lasted longer.</li>
    <li> At first, I really liked this dryer.  It&#x27;s lightweight and fairly powerful.  However, the motor died after about 100 uses.  First, it got increasingly loud (so I wouldn&#x27;t even use it in the morning out of curtesy for my still-sleeping husband a couple rooms over), then it died completely.  I don&#x27;t think 100 uses is excessive at all, and I would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Item received just as described and shipping dates were right on the money! Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  It has just the right amount of power and isn&#x27;t loaded with buttons and levers</li>
    <li> Not as high powered as the other I owned.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer for my natural hair.</li>
    <li> I gave this dryer as a gift and I have heard no complaints. Since they did not call me and ask me for the receipt to return it, it must be ok.</li>
    <li> Its a bit larger and heavier than I expected - but with its dual heat and power settings along with the diffuser (which I love), I have no complaints. Good, sturdy drier.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace a very expensive one that broke down. It seems to do the job. Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It dries my hair .  Nothing special about it.  The price was right.  It is too heavy to hold for a long time, if you have long hair.</li>
    <li> Dryer gas enough power to dry my hair for easy styling.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace a broken hair dryer.  Came quickly.  Used for first time and loved it.  Still works like a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have a T3 hairdryer that is similar to this one. If I had tried this revlon one 1st I would have never wasted my hard earned money on the T3! This hairdryer is fantastic!!! I bought it after my mother&#x27;s finally kicked the bucket. She insisted I not get one as expensive as my own, but as I wanted to get her a similar one I read reviews about how this one was great and thought it was worth a shot. One of the best purchases of the year. Revlon really nailed it.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT !&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money on an expensive blow dryer and concentrator/ diffuser. This is just as good as my $200 FHI one. Also way cheaper than you&#x27;ll find it at the store!</li>
    <li> My daughter received this as a gift.  She had requested this particular brand and style.  She seems happy with it.  The shipping was quick and easy.  It is not super loud like some hairdryers. Works for me.</li>
    <li> and does a damn good job of it, I have come to use it to warm my bathroom as well. Does a wonderful job cant beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the third in a series of attempts to find the right hair dryer for my wife, who has long thick hair.  The first one was a Vidal Sassoon that had ionic technology, but didn&#x27;t get near hot enough.  She was drying her hair for &gt; 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second attempt was the Revlon RV469 ceramic, which was much quieter and got hotter, but didn&#x27;t have much air flow.  Also, it is quite heavy.  It was better than the first dryer, but not hair drying nirvana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer (Revlon RV544) has easily cut my wife&#x27;s drying time in half.  She has very thick &amp; long hair, and the high heat setting makes quick work of it.  It gets hot enough that I actually tone it down to warm for myself (I have short, thick hair) whenever I have to use the dryer.  I think the air flow settings are perfect.  The dryer is also nice and light, and fits in a bathroom drawer easily, unlike some of the bulkier models out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife thinks this is the best dryer she has ever had.  We highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this dryer. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything, but this is the 1st that has cut down on drying time and also left my hair so smooth! In the past dryer have always left my hair looking puffy and have had to run a flat iron through it. The Revlon Tourmaline is the best! My hair has never looked better! I feel like I just had walked out of the salon for a professional blow-out. You have to get this if you have thick and coarse hair.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of reviews here, I decided to try this dryer. I have a dryer that I love, but I thought I should try to find a back-up for the inevitable time when mine dies. The one I have is a vortex dryer(with a bell shaped end) that lifts the hair as it dries and is wonderful! Anyway, I can&#x27;t find the same model, so I tried this Revlon model. Oh my...I have shoulder length color treated hair, kind of medium thickness and I ended up with a fuzzy mess! I gave up before it was quite dry and went back to my other dryer. I wish I would have had time to start over, but I would have been late for work. Ugh....hate a bad hair day. Another thing....the on/off switch is at a bad place. I kept turning it off as I was using it! My thumb kept hitting the switch. So....its not for me, but YMMV(your mileage may vary).</li>
    <li> Good hair dryer, the attachments are hard to get on and off if you like to switch them a lot but for the price its not bad.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sharper Image quiet ionic blow dryer for several years. It broke on me several times a year and I had to keep buying new ones. I finally got fed up with the poor quality and decided to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I ordered the Andis 75335 Quiet Ionic/Ceramic Hair Dryer. It over heated and shut itself off whenever I used it. I do have long hair, but this shouldn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I returned the Andis 75335 Quiet Ionic/Ceramic Hair Dryer and purchased the Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black. It&#x27;s an excellent dryer! It is lightweight, as advertised. It leaves my hair much softer than the other two dryers and my hair dries in much less time. I sincerely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My Braun hairdryer died about a month ago so I looked up reviews on another site for dryers (hint:MUA). This make and model generally received good reviews so I bought one that very afternoon. I can&#x27;t say enough for its power, settings and light weight. I have baby fine, shoulder length hair and I use the warm setting since the hot is too uncomfortable for me. This is a purchase that I am totally satisfied with and gladly recommend to anyone needing a new dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer based on the Amazon reviews I read.  Although I am still using it as it is much lighter than my previous revlon dryer, I am not impressed.  The on/off switch is located so that it at least 3 times per hair dry I am accidently shutting it off.  Also, the hottest setting is not hot enough to adequately dry your hair (mine being thick) in a shorter time period.  The only true good feature of this dryer is that it is lightweight.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER IS VERY HAPPY WITH HER FIRST HAIR DRYER.IT\\&quot;S GREAT ON A TEENAGER&#x27;S HAIR.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer.  I have medium length, medium thickness hair and it works great for me.  The high speed is high enough to really get to the roots, and the low speed is soft enough to style my bangs without blasting them all over the place.  The only issue is the buttons on the handle.  I find I inadverantly change the selections because the toggle buttons are right uner my fingers, but it is really no big deal.  It does dry my hair faster than my pervious dryer, if you had long or thick hair, I bet this dryer would really make a difference.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous hairdryer that I am still using over a year later!  I use it almost daily and it still is great.</li>
    <li> i have diabetic neuropathy in my hands and this dryer is very hard to hold without hitting the buttons to change the settings. i think i will tape down the setting i want so it doesnt keep changing while i keep changing hands to dry my hair. it blows pretty decent and it is light. my hair is very dry and that is why i bought a new hair dryer with the ions but i havent noticed any difference yet. hair is still dry and i use all kinds of deep conditioners and still dry.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this hair dryer and I really like it. It IS very lightweight, just as the other reviewers have said. I&#x27;m also amazed and how quickly it dries my very thick hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained about the placement of the controls, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be problem. In fact, I like how easily I can change the dryer settings while in use. And I find that that the amount of pressure required to actually flip the switches is sufficient that I don&#x27;t change the settings on accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have said that the hot setting is too hot, but I don&#x27;t agree at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My T3 hairdryer started sparking inside on me, so I needed a new dryer. I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot, as I wasn&#x27;t that crazy about my T3. It was heavy! It was also too hot for my scalp.I purchased the Revlon dryer and all I can say is WOW! It is very light weight, and very powerful. It also dried my hair in one minute! I have thick hair that&#x27;s down to the bottom of my neck, and using this dryer along with my hair straightening iron, makes my hair is so soft, and keeps it&#x27;s style! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I found this dryer in Consumer Reports where it&#x27;s highly rated and I bought it in a store a few years ago.  I loved it.  It last two years before it stopped blowing hot hair.  Because I couldn&#x27;t find this model in a store anymore, I found the same exact model on Amazon and ordered it.  The new one did not blow near as much air as my previous dryer of the same model.  It took forever to dry my hair and now my hair feels dried out.  This newer dryer only last me 8 months.  Really not happy with it and will be investing in a higher-quality dryer from now on.</li>
    <li> Growing up I worked in hair salons and my sister is currently a hairdresser so I&#x27;ve used many amazing &#x27;Professional&#x27; hair products and styling tools. I&#x27;ve always believed that &#x27;you get what you pay for&#x27; and spent over $60 (at a hair show) on a professional hair dryer, the CHI Nano in Pink, thinking it would last forever and would do less damage to my hair. Well, after just 1 year, my CHI has stopped working although, it worked well while it lasted. I began to research online various models including serveral T3 models which are priced above $150. On my last trip to Walgreens I figured I would get a cheap hair dryer to hold me over until I had more money to purchase the one I really wanted. $21.00 later, and I have no regrets or intentions of spending $150! This Revlon dryer has really changed my perception on &#x27;cheap&#x27; blow dryers. I would recommend it to anyone. It is SUPER light, not extremely quiet (it is 1875 watts!), and drys my thick head of wavy hair in the same, if not less time, than my expensive CHI dryer AND my hair is so soft even after I use my flat iron to tame those random wavy pieces &#x3D;) I can&#x27;t say anything but good things about this product. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Dryer works fine, as others have said, but main problem with it is the switches are placed right where one&#x27;s fingers naturally fall, causing it to switch off accidentally at least once every time I use it.  The pressure required to switch it on/off is not too great, so it&#x27;s easy to accidentally switch.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great. It drys hair quickly and the price is right! I would recommend buying this dryer. It makes my hair smooth too.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this product but the one issue I have is difficulty getting the attachments on and off. Since I use them every day, this is a problem.</li>
    <li> I first bought this hair dryer in 2012 after reading all the great reviews here.  It worked wonderfully for a little over 6 months before one day it started making this horrible clanking sound around the fan area when one of the plastic blades completely broke off.  I opened it up and was shocked to see that 2 other blades were also cracking and were ready to break off as well, making it 3 out of 4 plastic blades that were breaking off.  I tossed that one away, and decided to order 2 more at the time thinking that it was an anomaly, since I have never had a hair dryer died on my that quickly, and in that way, before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well!  After using another one for almost a year now, the same horrible sound appeared this morning followed by that horrendous clanking sound like something is banging around in there.  When I opened up this 2nd one, sure enough one of the plastic blades has almost cracked completely off, and its edge was grinding against the plastic, cylindrical housing when you turn it on.  Another blade was also cracking.  Very, very poor quality!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer works fantastically when it&#x27;s working, but after having 2 of them failing by breaking off their fan blades on me within 6 months to a year, it&#x27;s just not reliable enough for me to depend on it anymore.  Very poorly built and designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was used exclusively at home, and by me only.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy fine/ but a lot of hair. This product can reduce my hair from afro to minor frizz in just an hour. Took me almost 3 hours with my last hair dryer that sometimes worked but then lost heat. This dryer does not lose its heat, and is supper light weight compare to my old dryer. Dont really use the diffuser, my hair is to wild for it in the first place, (idk how to use the diffuse either.) overall decent product and gets the job done for the price.</li>
    <li> This one came with a sticker printed on the top &#x27;Compare at 120$&#x27;. At the purchase price of a little under 16$, I was a bit cynical about the boasting, but it does live up to its claim. Haven&#x27;t used it myself, but the wife is rather happy with this purchase and gladly recommends a five star rating.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy to operate buttons. Works great! I have no complaints with this purchase. Only feature I wish it had was a retractable cord.</li>
    <li> A high cost-effective dryer! Good quality with low price, but the two attachments is unused because I have short hair. Anyway, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> This is my first ionic hair dryer, and I must say it dries my hair faster than ever.  Also, the warm setting is more than adequate to dry my hair quickly without having to use the hot setting.  It&#x27;s very lightweight, and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert for sure, but this hair dryer works perfectly for me. My hair is just below my shoulders and (using no attachments), it takes me less than 5 minutes to dry my hair with this. Perfect heat and power. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is worth the money! It is dries my hair very quickly. My hair is very soft.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a crappy travel hairdryer, so I decided to opt for this &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; dryer that claimed that it would make my hair less frizzy. I was skeptical, but was presently surprised! I&#x27;ve only used this dryer for 2 months, but it has been great. Wonderful product if you&#x27;re looking for a simple dryer that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> This is enough power to to dry my hair. It is very convenient to set it is also the blower.</li>
    <li> I was using this for a little under a year, when the cord started acting flakey.  Two days in a row I had to hold the dryer at a certain angle for it to work, and then on the second day it suddenly started shooting out sparks.  I promptly dropped it and threw it away.  Before it broke it was one of my favorite dryers, until it tried to burn me.</li>
    <li> This is a hair dryer and it dries hair. It does it pretty good job. I use it to sometimes dry my dog after he has a bath, and he hates it, though I think because it is noisy. Most hair dryers are.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. Quick to dry, lightweight, quiet. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 years. ( 2 years of occasional use and 1 year of daily) It only recently started making a high pitched noise when it gets up to temperature. I&#x27;m not going to risk a fire, so I&#x27;ll call it dead. 3 years for a blow dryer as nice and inexpensive as this isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> gets my hair dry in half the time it took my old blow dryer, so happy with this purchase! its a steal for the price. very lightweight, so styling is easier. my hair is very frizzy naturally, and this gets it almost completely smooth! its rather impressive!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe all the reviews about drastically cutting down my drying time but this has most definitely done that for me! Not to mention, when I&#x27;m done, there are hardly any fly-aways or frizz!!! I used to look like a lion after drying my hair upside down but that is no longer the case! So glad I purchased this and not a $200 one!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s much more lightweight than my old one, dries my hair in a little more than half the time.  As most people, I have a problem with frizz and this really does seem to help (I was skeptical).  I have a travel dryer but I&#x27;m taking this one with me on trips because it is so much lighter and works so much better.</li>
    <li> This is my second Revlon hair dryer.  The first one lasted many years of daily use before it finally died.  The dry is lightweight and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Definitely hands down best blow drier I have ever owned! LOVE the results. love how light weight, because it&#x27;s so light weight I am able to blow dry my hair a lot easier, no more tired hands and I can really blow dry the sides and back of my thick, long hair better. It&#x27;s even light enough for my 12 year old to use it on her hair (by herself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed how soft the warm and hot air is which makes a huge difference on the hair too, I find my hair is not so harshly dry looking like it is from other blow dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE the diffuser and use it most often to enhance my natural curls in my long hair. It does a great job drying it (with the proper hair supplies of course)! I have considered buying 1 more so we have 2 in the house b/c I do have an 8 year old  daughter too it would be nice to have 2 around and quite honestly I don&#x27;t think I ever want to try another kind of blow dryer than this, for price was fantastic and it&#x27;s even better than the expensive one I paid for prior to this which was so heavy and made the hair too harshly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect for us!</li>
    <li> I was always that weird teenager in high school that never owned a hair dryer. I didn&#x27;t see why I needed one. Air drying was much easier and better for your hair. It wasn&#x27;t until I went to college and decided that I didn&#x27;t want dripping wet hair when I had somewhere to be that I decided to invest in my first hair dryer. This was it. I got it from Walmart for $25, and I honestly love it. I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without one. I&#x27;ve had this thing for about two and a half years now, and it&#x27;s never once shown me any problems. I use it often enough (though I don&#x27;t use it nearly as often as I used to). It&#x27;s worth the money, and it&#x27;s great for how cheap it is. It even comes with a defusor that I didn&#x27;t realize what it did until much later. I highly recommend it and the day that mine blows out I&#x27;ll buy another one of these, as I feel there&#x27;s no point in spending that much money on a hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer in Oct. and it stopped working in Feb. 4 months old and Amazons policy on returns expired. I guess I will go to Target.</li>
    <li> This is a very very powerful blow dryer which will dry your hair zip zip zip.  Yay for the good price point too!</li>
    <li> Great price, but still not strong enough for my wife&#x27;s long blonde hair (she has really nice hair).&lt;br /&gt;Apparently it&#x27;s not powerful enough to straighten her beautiful locks.</li>
    <li> It is a very good drier. It dries up very fast and lives my hair soft and brilliant… I am not an expert in hair products but i am happy with what I got for the price.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Blows me away! &amp;#34; lol. Very powerful! I love it, this is now my go to hairdryer.</li>
    <li> The heating element in my (10 year old) hair dryer starting going out so it was time to buy a new one. Revlon makes great long lasting hairdryers and I&#x27;m loving my upgrade.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and I like this a lot. It drys my hair really quickly and the air doesn&#x27;t get too hot to burn my hand. I use my finger to style it and when I am using other dryer, sometimes the air gets too hot and burn hand.</li>
    <li> My wife had been complaining about needing a new dryer.  I did some Amazon recon, got her initial buy-in, and after nearly a month of use, my wife really likes this.  Although I don&#x27;t know the details of what makes a dryer good, I will say it sounds much quieter than our last and she says it dries her hair faster, so that&#x27;s a win/win.  The price was incredible!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is wonderful and powerful. The iconic ceramic leaves my hair smooth to the touch and best of all, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the $300 dryer that it&#x27;s constantly being compared to, but this dryer is definitely better than other dryers of the same price. It dries my hair a lot faster and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as damaged/frizzy as with the Conair dryers I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It is very easy to manipulate temperature and flow of air. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> No complaints. I love using the cool shot and low settings so it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am interested in purchasing this item. But the only thing i am worried about is if it is 110v or 220v. Cause at my home it is all 110v outlets. So i am looking for a blow dryer that is 110v.</li>
    <li> Dries my hair fast and evenly.  I researched all hair dryers before buying this.  I have frizzy thick hair.  This hair dryer is great for my hair!</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for only 6 months, and it is already shorting out. It won&#x27;t blow hot air for longer than about 30 seconds, then it shows a green flash down the tube, and cold air comes out. It toggles between these two temperatures until I finally get my hair dry. I will be buying another brand tomorrow :/</li>
    <li> I can definitely tell the difference between using this and using my old blowdryer. Less frizz, more shine. Very happy. When this one inevitably dies, I will buy the same one again!</li>
    <li> A very nice hair dryer. Lightweight and works silently on my hair. For keeps!</li>
    <li> Fast drying time &amp; smoothens hair in the process. Fast shipping, easy to use. The time it takes to dry my long hair has significantly decreased.</li>
    <li> Super lightweight, dries my hair a lot faster than my old one, and noticeably cuts out frizz. It&#x27;s also a lot quieter than my old one. Would highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my friend, it was what she asked for and loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought another brand in the store and it made my hair not look very good.  I&#x27;m not sure why as you&#x27;d think a hairdryer is a pretty basic thing.  It&#x27;s light and not super loud.  The only problem is the switches on the handle.  Sometimes I turn the dryer off when I&#x27;m using it because the switches are right where I hold it.    UPDATED - I had the first one stop working after 8 months but I thought I&#x27;d give it another try.  The second one is dying after 7 months.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I loved this hairdryer and used it an average of twice a month (from October 13 through April 2015), until sparks flew out of it. It will be replaced by a completely different brand.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment; product as described!</li>
    <li> I have long super naturally curly hair and my last hair dryer was sparking and trying to kill me.  I did some research, was very nervous because usually hair products are true to &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.....I could NOT be more happy with this hair dryer. I&#x27;m so glad I listened to the reviews and bought it despite it&#x27;s cheap price tag. I used to have to flat iron after blow drying and now I don&#x27;t have to every time! And it has significantly cut down my drying time! LOVE this. Use it with a big round brush and voila!!!</li>
    <li> i would like for the cord to shrink, but it works really good</li>
    <li> This is beyond my expectation. The cold/warm/hot wind works just as I wish, and the top for straight hair is just what I need. Hope it is sustainable too.</li>
    <li> so far so good. this does a great job as a blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd hair dryer of this model in 2 years. For such a reasonably priced hair dryer, it can get very hot and do the same job as the higher priced models. My guess is that it is not intended to run that hot consistently and, thus, I burned out the motor after about a year&#x27;s worth of use. Considering I probably paid $20-ish bucks I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth. Would purchase this one again but would like to go a little longer between purchases this time.</li>
    <li> Excellent election. it does not show any problem, it arrive in perfect conditions. We expect buy something else soon, thanks for helps us.</li>
    <li> My last hair dryer lasted for 10 years but was clearly out of date compared this new one. The Tourmaline is way better and even though I have a lot of hair, it dries it quickly and isn&#x27;t too noisy. It came quickly, in brand new condition, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer. It works so well and my hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done quickly.  Wish there was one more fan &amp; temp setting, but it does the job pretty well &amp; the price is quite reasonable (at ~$25).</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer ever. Thanks to previous reviews for steering me in the right direction :)</li>
    <li> had Thai hairdryer for 10 months and it was only lightly used. I Plugged it in today and it powered on and off twice, then burst into flames! Sparks of fire flew all over my wooden floors &amp; I quickly stomped on them to prevent an inferno. The hairdryer cord melted off the dryer as it burned. I have a burn on my arm and luckily that was the worst thing that happened. It is completely unbelievable that Revlon has a product like this on the market.&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE!!!</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer for the price! High/hot setting dries my hair superfast without frying it. My hair stylist friend even commented that it is a great dryer. Will but this again if need be.</li>
    <li> The Revlon Ceramic Dryer does a great job at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> 2nd one that failed by stopping intermittently when cord is turned near the base</li>
    <li> Good weight, I have long hair and it will dry in 10 -15 mins. Not the quickest I have had but great price and size</li>
    <li> great purchase. works well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer a couple years and it still works perfect. Temp settings are just right for warm and hot with the cold shot option. Speeds are perfect for massive drying and then select with the low option. It&#x27;s light and manageable and I&#x27;ve never had issues with overheating it or the occasional slip to the floor. Hope it lasts for years to come as well!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and long hair. This blow dryer dries my hair in 15 minutes! Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> really great for the price. It is lightweight, and the button placement doesn&#x27;t bother me like some of the reviews have said. I have really fine hair and it gives it some life without making it frizzy. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> works great for an at home dryer, light weight but loud</li>
    <li> This is nice and lightweight and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair—I have very fine, platinum blonde—like other hair dryers. It&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
    <li> This was a great dryer while it worked. Unfortunately, after about 3 years of use, it&#x27;s gone kaput. I have short hair that takes 5-10 minutes to dry, so it&#x27;s not like I overused it. I&#x27;m annoyed to have to purchase another dryer so soon after the last one. I&#x27;ll be getting something else this time.</li>
    <li> I use the dryer all the time good product and great price. I would buy it again</li>
    <li> It is good enough but it is not as powerful as I thought it would be. A friend of mine borrowed it and she thought it was powerful enough though.</li>
    <li> From my 14 year old daughter: \\&quot;I did not like this at all! It was a waste of money it is so slow and it hardly dries your hair and I have extremely thin hair that dries so fast! It is BAD.\\&quot;    From the parent: It&#x27;s not that this is an awful dryer - it&#x27;s just surprised us that for the price it was not as powerful as we expected. We are returning it and purchasing a second Megaturbo 2500 which is terrific in terms of heat/volume.</li>
    <li> I checked the day I bought this, and it was December 30 2013 to be exact.  It is now November 15th 2014 at the time of writing this, so roughly one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked beautifully for the time that I owned it, except for the last week, it has been turning on and off during use, and sometimes not turning on at all. I feel that I have been generally careful with how I handled and maintained it, never dropped it, always unplugged after use, etc, so I can not say for certain what has been the cause of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would easily by 5 stars, if only it had held out a little longer.</li>
    <li> Really easy on my hair and makes great curls.</li>
    <li> This Dryer is very quiet &amp; heats up quickly. Fills solidly built.</li>
    <li> This dryer was everything I expected it to be.  The dryer has too attachments that are great for curly hair.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used countless dryers in my many years but this one is by far the BEST!  My hair has the look and feel of salon styling which I thought was unattainable at home.  I used no products on it on purpose and dried my washed hair before going to bed.  The next morning it still looked great! THAT has never happened before.  It is shiny and smooth and just feels healthy.  I will never again waste hundreds of dollars on high end dryers when Revlon puts out unbelievable equipment for under $20.00! OMG! I think I will get another one for my daughters to use as this one is MINE.</li>
    <li> I had a BedHead hair dryer for the past 7 years. It finally died while I was on vacation. When I got home i ordered this dryer. Not only was the price great, but the dryer itself is fantastic! I thought I loved my old dryer, but that thing can&#x27;t compare to the Revlon hair dryer. It gives you a fast dry and also softens your hair. The attachments it comes with easily attach to the dryer making them extremely easy to use. The cooling button does a great job setting my hair and ensuring the volume stays instead of quickly falling flat.&lt;br /&gt;I have no dislikes about this dryer and will recommend it to anyone looking for a great hair drying product!</li>
    <li> Lasted exactly 7 months and literally blew up in my wife&#x27;s hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY REVLON!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is nothing to speak of. It works... but doesn&#x27;t have the power I expected it to have.</li>
    <li> love it! so glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Better than the expensive dryers.</li>
    <li> I bought this just over two years ago. I loved it. Lightweight, dries my curly hair quickly.  But a few weeks ago it started to cut off randomly when drying my hair. I kept the back clean and free from debris. A week ago it started sounding like it was dying. The other day it made a loud noise and popped then started smoking. Very disappointed that it only lasted two years.</li>
    <li> The dryer works wonderfully.  It does seem to be a little low on the volume of air that it blows out, but all in all it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I have never used a hair drier as I have naturally soft and straight hair. I haven&#x27;t needed one until I decided to get hair extensions which didn&#x27;t match the texture of my hair - they were curly and frizzy. I bought this hair drier and was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. :) It is light and isn&#x27;t loud, easy to use, hot... Dries hair in minutes and most importantly - straightens with no frizz. It&#x27;s a great purchase!</li>
    <li> wife seems to like it</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It dries my hair in half the time, my hair is smoother and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see anything better than the normal and cheaper one.</li>
    <li> Dries hair super fast!</li>
    <li> Normally my hair dryers last the exact time for the warranty to expire. 366 days from start to finish. The beauty of a ceramic hair dryer is it lasts for years. I didn’t know they were capable of lasting that long until someone finally yelled at me for our throw away lifestyles and bought me one for Christmas. I’ve had mine for three years now. That is just the most amazing thing in the consumer world to me.</li>
    <li> Received for Christmas and have used everyday since (4).  So far I absolutely love this drier.  The hot is HOT the warm is WARM and the cool is COOL.  The drier does dry my medium length hair faster than any other drier I have used.  It does produce less frizz than I am used to.  The attachments are a bit of a pain to attach, that may be because they are new? The electric cord is a good length.  I def would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Although the price is nice and its functionality never displeased me, my second unit of this kind short circuited and caught fire while I was using it. I am not purchasing it again and am moving on to a more expensive hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I owned this blow dryer for well over fifteen years and it worked perfectly fine until that one faithful day that I dropped it one time too many and it cracked and even then, it was still working perfectly.  I finally laid mine to rest scared it would short circuit or something, but he was a fighter ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little big but its a great buy.</li>
    <li> Came on time, and looks just like the picture. I&#x27;ve been using it for two days now but it works very well. I&#x27;ll update my review if anything changes</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer in July for my daughter to take to summer camp. She really liked it. I tried it and it was so much better than my old hairdryer that I threw the old one away and have used this one ever since. It dries my hair very quickly and leaves it smooth and shiny. My daughter has long hair and she also loves this dryer.</li>
    <li> Lightweight...easy to hold.  I am very happy with this dryer.</li>
    <li> I really like it. My hair is fine and I think it does a good job so far. Very lightweight.</li>
    <li> I thought that the heat on the blower was going to be stronger and it really is weak compared to others I have bought and used.&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this dryer to my friends. When people with curly hair like mine purchase a blower, we need strong settings in order to do different levels of drying. If we want to leave our hair curly, we would go with a warm setting, However, most of the time we want to straighten out our curls, and that is where a strong heat setting is required. This is not a dryer for curly hair or for someone who wants heat to straighten our their hair thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I have mid-long hair and wash it every day. It dries my hair around 20 min, fast and easy to use!</li>
    <li> this is a great buy.  It dries my long and thick hair in half the time as my old hair dryer.  I got this for a good price too.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for nine months... and while using it today HUGE shocks came out of the cord and burned me on the arm. It is not eligible for return, but I thought those interested in it should know. I do not wrap the cord tightly during storage and it is used probably twice a week (so less than 100 times total). I wish there were an option to try and exchange an item that did not hold up well or is faulty?</li>
    <li> I have been using this model for 8+ years when it died, so I reordered the exact same one from Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Dependable. Only think I did not like is where the controls are located. Sometimes I will accidently turn dryer off if I&#x27;m holding a certain way.</li>
    <li> The grate on the back is very open and there&#x27;s no filter. I have to be very careful when I&#x27;m drying my long hair because it sometimes gets sucked in the back and torn out of my head. OUCH! Also, the angle of the handle LOOKS cool but it means I have to bend my wrist back. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to it but it&#x27;s awkward. Not the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had and a little dangerous.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer was fine for a year and a half or so, but then, as some other reviewers have said, the cord shot sparks and split in half. I won&#x27;t buy a Revlon hair dryer again.</li>
    <li> Fabulous for the price! It has a place at the end to flip open and clean out hair. Very light weight.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and dries faster then my old drier even without any of the attachments it comes with. The sound it makes is not that loud for a hair drier compared to my old one. Not sure but my hair seems to not get static, possibly the ionic technology.</li>
    <li> The cord became damaged and the hair dryer did not last one year. I did not wrap the cord tightly when storing either. I&#x27;m so disappointed that I can not find a hair dryer that will last.</li>
    <li> This hair drier does exactly what I want it to do. It is light-weight, powerful, and relatively quiet.... All at a reasonable price. I wanted a fast drier, the less powerful ones are a waste of time for me. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money. For a guy like me with medium length hair, the low heat and low fan speed settings are perfect.</li>
    <li> works well, I rarely blow dry at home, I really got this to blow dry my Yorkie between grooming appointments. I have used it a few times on my own hair and it seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> I have very long and thick hair,bit frizzy. I thought of straightening my hair without using flat iron, just by blow drying. So bought this \\&quot;Revlon RV544PKF 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer\\&quot;. It does its job so well. The diffuser/concentrator attachment helps smoothen my hair. The heat and speed settings are perfect for any kind of hair styling. Also its very safe to use as it has TEST and RESET button which helps u test for proper functioning of the product before use.&lt;br /&gt;Just one thing which bothers me is that sometimes my hair gets stuck in the rear motor. But i guess thats the problem with almost every dryer. So to avoid this, while m styling a part of my hair, i clip up the rest of them.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product as its really very good and not too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, not to forget mentioning, this product was delivered to me before time. I was surprised. Thanks to AMAZON. :)</li>
    <li> It has been healthy so far...motor tend to die fast in hair dryers....The only problem is the switch ...It&#x27;s too easy to hit the off switch because it is placed where it must be held</li>
    <li> This dryer is lightweight and powerful.  Has 2 different speeds, 2 different heat settings, plus a diffuser.  Very reasonably priced.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! After spending $100+ on my last two hair dryers that didn&#x27;t last any longer that a little over a year...I&#x27;m over it. I thought I would give this one a try and if I didn&#x27;t like it, I wouldn&#x27;t be out much money. Well, it works great. In fact, I appreciate that it has both high/low heat &amp; high/low speed settings. I feature I didn&#x27;t have on the last two expensive hair dryers. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Cord started fraying within the first year of having this.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is not as good as the last one, same model</li>
    <li> got it for the gym, works well, great size!</li>
    <li> My hair seems to dry faster with this dryer and no frizzies.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Awesome dryer, dries my hair fast. I bought this after my beloved Q dryer quit working, and after having a Q, the only downside to this dryer is the fact that it is so loud.</li>
    <li> I love how fast it dries my hair. got it at a great price. would order again</li>
    <li> Found it to be too big, and the attatchment was way to big for lifting and drying my hair. Sorry i didn&#x27;t like it at all. The price was good, and the airflow!</li>
    <li> My wife comes out of the bathroom with dry hair every night so I guess it works fine. She said she &amp;#34;Likes it&amp;#34;. But she is hard to please.</li>
    <li> Great shipping time and wonderful hairdryer for CURLY hair. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> This worked for 8 months and then died.  Normally these last longer...I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC HAIR DRYER. It is light weight, and dries your hair very quickly!</li>
    <li> High power is not terribly strong, but it works consistently and as advertised</li>
    <li> This dryer works, but it is quite light and feels like cheap plastic. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now without problems, but I&#x27;ll probably end up buying a different one.  It doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as I would like it to, even though it&#x27;s 1875 watts.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer without doing any research. It&#x27;s the number one best selling hair dryer on Amazon and it was less than the $25 dollar gift card I had. Win win.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived about 27 hours after I placed the order, thank you Amazon prime. I&#x27;ve used it two or three times. I like it a lot, my hair dries quickly without feeling fried. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that there is no medium speed, only high and low.</li>
    <li> I do not blow dry my hair a lot.  I don&#x27;t know anything about hair dryers.  I was told I needed to use a diffuser, so I bought this one.  It has been great.  Arrived just as expected and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love it. powerful, my thick, medium length hair is dry in 10 minutes. has hit the floor a few times &amp; survived.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the end of October 2015  and loved it. In July of 2016 it stopped working. We never packed it up and took it anywhere and it was gently used. So disappointing. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Poor performance. Don&#x27;t Buy it. i&lt;br /&gt;t doesn&#x27;t dry hair from regular distance, and if you use it close burns hair and fuzzes.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this dryer daily with great results. It&#x27;s powerful yet lightweight and comfortable to hold. I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer dries my hair faster than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  I would definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> This dryer is quieter than most.  I really like the attachment that allows you to concentrate the air just where you want it, as it allows for better styling.  It&#x27;s got just enough power, and it pretty lightweight too.</li>
    <li> im not quite sure whether the ionic function works or not but i like the heat it produces and the rest of the functions</li>
    <li> Gave this to my wife, and it burned out after a weeks worth of usage. I probably just have a defective unit but it should be known.</li>
    <li> Does more than what I need on a day-to-day basis. Good price for its functionality, I like my recent purchase!</li>
    <li> No more wet hair. Especially during winter time, this helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold and manage. we have not see any issues so far.</li>
    <li> Great airflow and settings.  I also like the cool air button to finish. It makes my hair shiny!</li>
    <li> This dryer seriously has a salon effect. It feels and does work like the ones in beauty salons. I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this hairdryer. It&#x27;s not the most expensive hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned, but it does the job and does it quickly.</li>
    <li> Dries my long, thick hair quickly and enables me to curl my hair with an iron shortly after.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s perfect for me....</li>
    <li> This is a great blow dryer for my long, thick curly hair. The diffuser is ok but I continue to use my old one as this one doesn&#x27;t contain the hot air so well. But the dryer is light, simple and easy to maneuver. Hair stays shiny and frizz at a minimum.</li>
    <li> Purchased this May 8 2014, it is now May 16th 2015. The chord on this dryer is VERY unsafe. It started shorting out on my wife about 4 months ago. Now, it sparks when you start it up. Terrible design.</li>
    <li> Great value for such a good price! This is the best dryer that I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m very glad I stumbled upon this one. I was looking for a quieter dryer because I don&#x27;t want to disturb my husband&#x27;s sleep anymore. This was just the right dryer for me.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great ionic blow dryer! Replaces Revlon&#x27;s previous model I got several years ago, so I definitely got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Bought from Amazon Dec...Now early March, won&#x27;t switch on-off. Covered under warranty, but...sending dryer postage paid to Texas, plus $6 for &amp;#34;handling/postage&amp;#34; for a $20 dryer makes no sense.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy different dryer and take this apart to attempt to fix the switch.&lt;br /&gt;Other than It doesn&#x27;t work now, it performed well for 80 days...meh.</li>
    <li> I am presently using a hairdryer identical to the Revlon RV544PKF.  I bought this one as a backup.  It does a great job. I like the the selection of settings.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer! Works great, I&#x27;ve used it in a salon setting for months and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is great, it&#x27;s easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t blow too much and it&#x27;s settings are perfect for keeping your hair in good shape!</li>
    <li> I just love my new hair dryer!  It truly dries my hair in half the time, and leaves it in good condition.  Which is saying a lot, since I&#x27;m an old white-haired lady.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the current girlfriend to try to get her out of the bathroom quicker. She had some outdated blow dryer and it seemed to take forever to dry her hair. Since we got ready for work at the same time in a one bedroom apartment, this was becoming a problem. Bought her this and I must say I&#x27;m just as happy as she is with it. Quick with different settings. The only downside is the noise but when isn&#x27;t it with a hair dryer? Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> If you just want a cheaper hair dryer, this one has power and works fine. But mine did break after a year, just stopped working electrically.</li>
    <li> The heat level is fine, but the highest wind or blowing speed feels like medium/light. As a male with medium-length hair, I don&#x27;t see how someone could recommend this particular product (compared to the 10 other options out there at c. $20) to anyone with longer-than-short hair.</li>
    <li> I had this dryer a couple of years and it worked well.  Kept the filter clean and used it daily.  Eventually the dryer started emitting sparks into my hair.  I rated it a three because it was a good hair dryer when it wasn&#x27;t trying to catch my hair on fire.</li>
    <li> Received on time. The product works as advertised. I don&#x27;t see the need for the diffuser. The manufacturer should remove it and lower the price. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The low heat setting and cleanable filter make this  product particularly remarkable.  These features are uncommon for currently available hair dryer.</li>
    <li> All the reviews here are accurate.&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight and easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;Hot is not so hot as to burn you and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It gets a little too hot for me and I don&#x27;t really notice that it shortens my drying time, but it does make my hair look and feel really shiny. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product- excellent service. It is a good quality product, I have been using it since 2013 and it is still working.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after 3 months..This morning I turned on the switch and nothing...Crappy product, I want my money back. How is this the best seller</li>
    <li> Works good, I only used it once.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel frizzy at all after use. So far so good.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Wow really great blow dryer. Best blow dryer I ever used. The blow dryer is very simple but works great when drying the hair, it did not leave my hair very poofy.</li>
    <li> Waste of money, Amazon can you read this and get me a replacement?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine just broke yesterday, so it lasted a total of a month and a half, with light usage (once in the morning for medium thickness hair).</li>
    <li> I recently went back to relaxing my hair after being natural for three years and knew I would need a decent blow dryer and wanted one that was tourmanline ionic ceramic with an air-flow nozzel. This dryer provided me with everything I was looking for at a great price. I like that it has a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; setting that allows me to use a little less heat on my tresses. I have only used to dryer once thus far but I found that my hair was shiny, smooth, and soft. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Though it was lightweight and dried hair quickly, it only lasted a few months before developing a short and stopped working.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer worth the money. My wife like this hair dryer alot. short time drying her hair and not much noise.</li>
    <li> Used this product twice so far and it&#x27;s working great.</li>
    <li> The best affordable and quality blow-dryer on Amazon. I use this blow-dryer with a round brush to blow out my hair - and my hair is always left soft and shiny. The heat gets very hot, but can also be a good amount of heat on the low setting. The diffuser is a great size and works great. So does the nozzle. So great!</li>
    <li> Not sure why this gets such great reviews.  I bought it because it&#x27;s the # 1 seller here - and I won&#x27;t make that mistake again. It died after 1.5 months of irregular use (maybe used 1-2 times a week) and I wasn&#x27;t impressed by its performance when it did work.</li>
    <li> 100% love this hair dryer. I have curly, frizzy, fine hair. (I live in the south and with humidity my hair gets frizzy and curly even after straightening it) This hair dryer helps big time to keep my hair looking better for longer periods. I have noticed a big difference! The on/off switch doesn&#x27;t get in my way like the others have posted about.</li>
    <li> I bought this  dryer because it was so highly rated.  Some people had complained about the buttons being poorly placed and I agree.  I would often hit them while using the dryer and it would change the speed or temperature as a result.  It recently stopped working, too.  I only used it about 2-3x a week maximum for about 2 years.  My husband took it apart and adjusted the wiring about 6 months ago or else it would have been useless even earlier.  It is definitely dead now- was making some frightening noises and producing burning smells.  Goodbye Revlon.  I pulled out my old lower-watt Windmere travel dryer that I used for many years through high school, college, grad school and beyond to use until I receive a newer dryer that I recently ordered from Amazon. I don&#x27;t plan to purchase Revlon again. I was not impressed.</li>
    <li> Hair dryer works great has attachments for styling but I don&#x27;t use them so can&#x27;t really comment.  I would purchase again</li>
    <li> I bought several of these for our household after having success with the first one.  A lot of blowing power and heat.</li>
    <li> The Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer is great.  It is powerful and I love the different settings: Hot/Warm/Cold, Hi/Lo.  Plus, it&#x27;s lightweight so my arm doesn&#x27;t get sore holding it above my head.</li>
    <li> This same hair dryer was for 38 bucks in my local shop. (Got it for 17 bucks from amazon) I was hyped when I saw it on amazon for such a cheap price, but was doubtful that it might be a piece of junk. But It was good. My friend, brother, sister and I use it. (Not too often) just when we are heading out to a party or something. It&#x27;s really good, totally worth buying! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this dryer 2 years ago, almost to the date, and works perfectly fine.  No noises or malfunction.  It dries my hair quickly and the 2 settings, warm &amp; hot, are just what I need.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Having very thick long hair makes drying it a real pain. With this dryer, I don&#x27;t mind it near as much and can dry my hair in about half the time it took with any other hair dryer!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the bees knees. It can dry my very long very thick hair in like 10 minutes its a god send. Really good buy. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, nothing too complicated. I always use the lower settings because I have shorter hair, but that&#x27;s usually the case with all blow dryers.</li>
    <li> Between my daughters, my granddaughters, my hairdresser grandson, and me, we have six of this model hairdryer.  Everyone, including my grandson, has long hair but me and they all love it.  It has a lot of power and both high and low temperature settings as well as blower speeds.  They all say it really cuts down on the frizzies too.  I don&#x27;t think you can beat it anywhere for the price.</li>
    <li> It work fine for 7 months then shorted out. Now must replace it. I will try something else this time.</li>
    <li> Shipping was just as expected and product works great</li>
    <li> Works very well I really like this dryer, recommend it. I might have gotten it at Walmart if I would have known it was sold there as well, and not have had to pay for shipping, but its okay. I love this dryer</li>
    <li> To heavy, to big, awkward to use ,underpowered. It stopped working after 2 years.</li>
    <li> ok....heres the thing...im indian mixed with black.....i have 3b/3c type hair.  Now i love this hair dryer.  I have an issue witth frizz, obviously because of my looser curl pattern, particularly with the front of my hair.  normally i dry my hair turban style with a cotton t shirt, but i find myself pressed for time lately.  i heard about this product and decided to give it a try.  and it is definitely worth the money, and space lol.  It left my hair less frizzy (i&#x27;ve come to terms that there will always be some friz), and silky soft.  had a nice shine to it, just like when i turban it.  now it did shrink my hair a bit, but it added volume and was nice and full, and gave me that cute non frizzy defined curl afro i was looking for.  The diffuser piece its self is actually pretty big, i was like where the hell am i gonna put this lol.  but its worth finding space for.  just a tip to avoid heat damage use it on a low warm setting AND DON&#x27;T FORGET YOUR HEAT PROTECTANT because i&#x27;m pretty sure no one likes fried hair.  i found the chord to be long enough, at least for me.  i don&#x27;t ever use the other piece except for when i&#x27;m painting to dry things faster, or when i plan on flat ironing my hair, but i&#x27;m sure it has its purposes too lol.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! At first, I thought it didn&#x27;t work well because my previous hair dryer would get so hott and I would have to take breaks. This one wasn&#x27;t extremely hot which is great! I no longer have to take breaks while drying my hair!</li>
    <li> I bought as a gift and when I arrived in my country gave to my sister .. But it is not working - now I don&#x27;t know what to do - nobody helps or answers my emails :(</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and fairly quiet. Toggle buttons are easy to hit while styling though, changing it from &#x27;on&#x27; or &#x27;off&#x27; or &#x27;hot&#x27; to &#x27;warm&#x27; but not a big deal. A bit worried about reviews that mention sparks from where the cord connects to the unit so I&#x27;m being careful not to wrap the cord tightly.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with this hair dryer! It is perfectly quiet for a $30 piece. The settings are exactly what I need and the attachments are easy to attach.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift because I needed one.  Well, I love it. I like how its tourmaline, way better on your hair!</li>
    <li> Heavy, yet cheap feeling.  The grip is too small, too light, and slick.  All the weight is up with the motor, so it feels terribly unbalanced.  The weight of it wears my arm out, and yet it doesn&#x27;t push as much air as the travel folding Revlon Rvdr5033 it was supposed to replace.  I immediately regret this decision...</li>
    <li> The dryer is awesome couldn&#x27;t of asked 4 more although it didn&#x27;t come with instructions so i had to Google but it is a great product:-)</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s light weight and at a great price it does what it has to do. But I&#x27;ve had it for about 7 months now and the hot air will eventually begin to cool down. I have to constantly switch back between the warm and hot setting to get it to heat up again and within 30-90 seconds it will cool down again.&lt;br /&gt;For diffusing my curls it is awesome which is why I&#x27;m giving it two stars. It gets my curls nice and bouncy and beautiful, but at the same time most dryers come with a great diffuser. The concentration nozzle on the other hand is not great. It comes off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I blow-out my hair it does not give me shine or volume and I&#x27;m using great brushes. My hair is not feeling this dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to bother contacting Revlon to have this replaced I&#x27;m just going to invest in a professional dryer. This is great for a teen that is clumsy and you don&#x27;t want to shell out too much for them to just break it in a few months. But if you can afford a better dryer I recommend you just bite the bullet and do that</li>
    <li> Not because it broke, but I kept dropping it and I broke the screen on the back of the dryer where the air intake is. But it&#x27;s a great, reliable dryer that I&#x27;ve been using for a couple years now!</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is everything I wanted. It&#x27;s a great deal for the price and met my expectations. Also was a quick delivery!!</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this!  A quick look at the other 1-star and 2-star reviews should tell you what you need to know, as this thing has apparently caused TONS of sparking and even flaming incidents.  (I searched the reviews for the word &amp;#34;fire&amp;#34; and got 84 results, some dating back to 2011.)  Mine was in use for about a year and a half before it became temperamental.  In the middle of drying my hair, it would shut off for a second, but changing angles or adjusting the cord where it meets the unit solved the problem temporarily, so I kept using it while starting to think about a replacement. In retrospect, I should have stopped using it immediately at the first sign of a problem.  After a week or so of this temperamental behavior, the thing suddenly popped really loud and made a HUGE spark, causing me to drop it and jump back, thinking I was about to be burned and/or electrocuted.  I have GFCI protected outlets plus the similar protection on the unit, but it didn&#x27;t matter.  I return here and see a ton of people reporting similar issues (again, 84 results for the word &amp;#34;fire&amp;#34; in these reviews, and well over a hundred results for &amp;#34;spark&amp;#34;!).  This thing should be pulled immediately; it&#x27;s absurd that this many people have been reporting problems for this long and yet they&#x27;re still being sold.  I reported it to saferproducts.gov, Amazon, and Revlon.  Others who&#x27;ve had issues should do the same.  Amazon assured me they&#x27;d stop selling while they investigated, but they never did.  It&#x27;s appalling that the many reports already here are apparently not yet enough to motivate anyone to take responsible action to prevent injuries.  If you insist on purchasing one, all I can say is take some screenshots of all these reports for your lawsuit.</li>
    <li> A nice hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t cause frizz when when I use the diffuser on my curly hair.  It is light weight.</li>
    <li> I love the Revlon hair dryer. It looks sophisticated, it&#x27;s very comfortable to handle, offers a variety of settings, and is relatively quiet. All in all, it&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> I like this blow dryer because it heats up really fast, it&#x27;s has a hot and warm button plus a cold shot feature! Best dryer I&#x27;ve owned. Faster dry time also!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s really much to say about a hair dryer, except that this one works well as far as drying hair. I don&#x27;t really see any amazing ion effect, so I can&#x27;t give it props in that area. I also think that the diffuser is a little strange being flat. It&#x27;s kinda hard to get your hair to stay on it. A cupped diffuser is better. Overall, it&#x27;s okay as far as a unit that will dry your hair, but don&#x27;t expect anything else but that. It is lightweight, so I gave it 3 stars for living up to that description.</li>
    <li> Great so far!! Love it! If that changes, i will update.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna order one for my mom!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer leaves a residue on my hair that makes it look greasy.  I know it says it has a conditioning element to it, but I did not expect this result!  Ended up not even being able to use it!</li>
    <li> It works great!  So far so good!  I bought this when my older went out and it does just fine!</li>
    <li> The dryer has power, but the thing is made of crappy plastic. I can&#x27;t even blow dry my bangs without the directional tool melting. Do yourself a favor and spend the money on a dryer that has a harder plastic shell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good hair dryer and is a great deal!</li>
    <li> I have had this for 2 years now and use it almost every day. Its not too loud, still works great, easy to hold in hand, has the bonus piece, good price and good setting, hot, warm, cold and low/high. Works perfectly fine as should and I have no complaints with product.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly has described in the description and I would recommend this product as a general use blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This blowdryer has the best diffuser attachment I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  It really diffuses so all you get is heat, no blowing around of the hair, so the curls keep their shape better.  Also, for some reason it&#x27;s hotter than my old 1875 watt dryer, so my hair dries more quickly.  Unlike other reviewers, I have the same amount of frizz as I did with my old dryer-- the ion part just doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  But the curls are better shaped because the diffuser prevents them from being blown around.  The one negative is that the on-off switch is on the handle right where you hold the blowdryer, so it pokes your hand and you end up occasionally turning it off by accident.  To avoid this you can hold it lower down on the  handle but that&#x27;s awkward.  Nonetheless, I would completely recommend this dryer, especially if you have curly hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for smaller hands.  It was nicely made and had great features and attachments.  Quality silver coating and lightweight.  Price was fair.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and the dryer and difuser are perfect. I dry to about 80% quickly and let the last bit airdry. No frizz</li>
    <li> I never thought that just a hair dryer could make such a difference until I tried this one! I have been looking around for a good ionic dryer to speed up my styling time and provide better results (less frizz, shiny, more body).... almost purchased a $200 hair dryer until I came across the reviews for this Revlon. Had it shipped next day air because I was so anxious to try it. Let me tell you, the reviews definitely prevailed on this one! Hands down the best blow out I have ever had in my entire life, including salon visits! Usually takes me about 45 minutes to blow dry and style my short bob haircut, with this little gem it took 15 minutes!! I didn&#x27;t even need to use my straightener to smooth out the ends. Super lightweight too! Can&#x27;t beat the quality and price. Seriously best purchase I have ever made on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I actually bought this hair dryer from another site, but thought I would share my experience here now that I&#x27;m looking for a new hair dryer...again...  I was pretty happy with the power, heat, and weight of the dryer at first use.  My hair is chin length and straight, so only takes about 10-15 minutes to style from start to finish.  Within the first week I started to notice that the dryer nozzle was starting to melt around the rim.  I only use the concentrator attachment for the last few minutes of styling, and noticed that it also started bubbling and quickly burnt big holes on either side of the attachment.  The dryer doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a lot of them out there, so I&#x27;m kinda baffled by this.  It&#x27;s actually the first time I&#x27;ve ever seen it happen on any dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Long story short, I expected the dryer to last longer than just under two months.  If I had it to do over I would put the $20 towards another good quality hair dryer that won&#x27;t end up looking like some weird melted mess.  Very poor quality and not worth $20.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer ever. Much lighter than similar, works well on my hair. The whole drying takes me only a few minutes. I totally love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I read a few reviews about how this hair dryer isn&#x27;t good for fine hair. I have very fine and frizzy hair. This hair dryer worked great on my hair. My hair feels smooth and shiny. And it makes my hair straight. I don&#x27;t use hair straightener anymore! I love it and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Tourmaline really does help keep down the frizz.  I have very fine hair, and most blow dryers tend to leave it frizzy or with lots of flyaways, even on low heat.  This one didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really appreciated that it is significantly lighter than my other blow dryers.  Between carpal tunnel problems, fibromyalgia, and a touch of arthritis, I have had problems with holding my old dryer.  This one did not hurt or even tire out my hand or wrist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely something I&#x27;d recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I had a Conair Infiniti hair dryer that was not working so well anymore, so I replaced it with this Revlon hair dryer.  I had high hopes for it based on the reviews, and I was looking forward to having a lighter-weight hair dryer.  I have slightly wavy, thick hair that I blow dry straight.  I used this hair dryer for 3 weeks and every time I did, it made my hair frizzy and dull.  I was so disappointed.  I have now replaced it with a Conair Infiniti Pro, and my hair looks great again.  That hair dryer makes my hair straight, smooth, and shiny.  I did give this Revlon hair dryer 2 stars for being lightweight.  That was the only nice thing about it.</li>
    <li> I actually really liked this hair dryer while it worked. It dried my hair relatively quickly. It also came with both a concentrating nozzle to make my hair straighten nicely and with a diffuser that worked really well at drying my hair on cold days that I wanted to leave it curly. While the dryer works, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started giving me trouble almost exactly one year after I purchased it, right when the warranty ends. It started by sparking once or twice as I was drying my hair. Then it began to stop blowing at random intervals until I tilted the hairdryer in different directions. It wasn&#x27;t the plug - trying this at different outlets yielded the same result. This was annoying, but it seemed that if I pointed the dryer in a certain direction and didn&#x27;t move, it would continue to blow. Then, finally, it got so bad that drying my hair was impossible - the blow dryer was stopping more than it was blowing. I expected it to last for longer than a year, so overall, the purchase was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I have very long straight hair.  This dryer is lightweight and easy to manage.  I would definitely recommend for long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for two years now. I have had no problems with it. Great value and works well.</li>
    <li> As a blow dryer it works great. I don&#x27;t personally understand the ion thing and I see no difference, but for the price if they want to say that there is an ion thing that makes my hair better that is fine by me.</li>
    <li> I have very very long blonde thick hair so i always would buy expensive blow dryers thinking that they had to be the best bc they cost so much but i just got sick of them not working. My friend had this same Revlon Dryer i tried it and loved it worked so great i got one of my own. It has multiple settings for when you dry yr hair but doesn&#x27;t damage it and best of all its light weight.</li>
    <li> Lasted a year and 4 months. Pretty good preformance for the price. Just didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I must say I was skeptical about buying this hair dryer, but no more.  For $20 it gets the job done beautifully.  I have long curly and frizzy hair, and it normally takes me twenty minutes or more to dry my hair, but with this dryer it is done in 10 minutes.  It also leave my hair feeling softer and much less frizzy that a normal dryer.  I have only used it twice so far, but I am a happy customer.  The only problem with this hair dryer is that the cord is about 10-12 inches too short, but I can deal with that for $20.</li>
    <li> This is one of those cases where I just decided to go with the high reviews rather than the product description and it paid off.  Not that this description is poor, but others ones seemed a little better fit for me.  I did a lot of searching around for different hair dryers.  I checked out the displays at Target and saw them in person, held them up and could see button placement, etc.  I am extremely impressed with the new tourmaline ceramic curling irons and straighteners - it leaves my hair looking like a salon finish.  So I wanted to check out the hair dryers too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The dryer definitely leaves my hair softer, not as fly away and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;~It is much lighter than my old hair dryer.  There were a couple of other hair dryers with a different motor that were really heavy to hold, but seemed like the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;~I really like the attachments - they work great.  The diffuser is the perfect size, not too large, not too small.&lt;br /&gt;~It does take me the same amount of time to dry my hair though - no difference there for me.&lt;br /&gt;~I like the button selection with hot and warm (I only use warm which is plenty heated for me) and high and low speed.  I don&#x27;t use the cold shot button - I never liked that button on any hair dryer - it&#x27;s too much of pain to hold down and move the dryer around at the same time, especially if you want it a little warm, but it&#x27;s there for those who do like it.&lt;br /&gt;~The buttons can be a little in the way of holding the dryer, but it&#x27;s not enough of a deterrent for me not to love the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;~I personally like the little holder on the bottom, that&#x27;s how I put it away - hanging upside down. Although I wish there was a way to put the cord away easily.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would rank it as one of the best hair dryers on the market, probably the best in its price range.</li>
    <li> Great price. Gift for my mom. She likes this dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought this in Sept. 2013, and it lasted about a year and a half before shorting out this morning. Right where the ribbed part of the wire meets the normal skinner part, the hair dryer started smoking this morning! (I made sure to never wrap the cord around the dryer or kink the cord, so not sure why this happened.) There was a little smoke and then it shut off. I flicked the off/low/high button a couple times, to no avail. It was a good hair dryer while it lasted, very powerful and lightweight, but I expect any electrical product to last longer than this.</li>
    <li> Well for this price I cannot really complain, however it is just not powerful enough though. I will just keep it as a back up.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t managed to use it yet, since I&#x27;m having to save up a couple of thousand dollars to expand my bathroom to accommodate the HUGENESS of this hair dryer!!  It&#x27;s about 4 times bigger than my old hair dryer that it is replacing  And that was an entirely normal sized portable hair dryer.  This on would take up half a suitcase, so no travelling for this baby.  It is at least a foot long from end to end with the diffuser in place.  The handle is another 8\\&quot; going at right angles to the blower part, so you can get some idea of how much space it takes up.  I  frankly don&#x27;t know where I can put it when not in use.  My old one I could hang on the wall near my mirror and it was discreet in appearance and proportion.  This one&#x27;s a MONSTER!!  And I can&#x27;t believe that it is superior in performance in proportion to its great size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I held it in my hand and pretended that I was trying to dry my hair.  And because of its great distance from handle to the blower tip, I felt no control of it.  And to move it around my head to reach all parts of my hair, requred flexing muscles I&#x27;m not used to extending so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work like a charm , but it is an absolutely HORRIBLE  design.  It is so unwieldy that I am considering returning it.</li>
    <li> I had this dryer for around 18 months before it just stopped working. I liked it, used it regularly, and it worked well but I expect my appliances to last longer than that. I&#x27;d rather pay $10 more for a dryer that will last a few years.</li>
    <li> After my old OLD hair dryer bit it, I started hunting around for a big-girl dryer that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank. This item came up over and over again, and for the price, I figured it was worth a shot. I had been using a cheapy-McCheaperson dryer (that I&#x27;ve had since childhood--d&#x27;oh!), so I didn&#x27;t think I could get something worse for my hair than that thing anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, very fine hair that goes static crazy when it&#x27;s dry out. While I didn&#x27;t notice it at first, now that I think about it, my hair is not as static-y as it used to be. I also don&#x27;t seem to notice as much damage to my hair as I used to, especially when it comes to split ends. However, I&#x27;ve also started to take better care of my hair than I used to and I now use preventative products such as a heat protectant and a tiny bit of Argan oil to help protect and maintain hair health, so while I&#x27;ve noticed hair improvement, I have no idea if it&#x27;s from the hair products, the dryer, or both (I designed a very poor scientific experiment--too many variables. Sorry!). As far as dry time, I don&#x27;t think I notice much of a difference, but my hair is very fine and I don&#x27;t have much of it to begin with, so if my drying time was cut from 6 to 5 minutes, I wouldn&#x27;t notice. I don&#x27;t use the concentrator or the diffusor, so I can&#x27;t comment on those. However, the dryer doesn&#x27;t seem overly noisy or heavy, which I like, especially for the technology that&#x27;s packed inside. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my boyfriend uses it every once in a while, and he never did that with my old one, so maybe it&#x27;s sleek and cool looking enough that he reaches for it now? Hah, I have no idea! I also haven&#x27;t had any problems with the buttons being in the wrong place, or anything like that. I wish it had a swivel and/or retractable cord, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world that it doesn&#x27;t. However, take note that those features are lacking if that is important to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I haven&#x27;t had the amazing experience that others have had with this dryer, but I think it&#x27;s more due to the thinness and fineness of my hair. I haven&#x27;t had any negative experiences, just haven&#x27;t been blown away (har har) like some others have. I&#x27;d still recommend this dryer to others, as it&#x27;s a decent dryer for the tech that&#x27;s packed inside, even if those bonuses don&#x27;t seem to change my hair&#x27;s life!</li>
    <li> Nice product and great price</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good hair dryer. However, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for cord not lasting for more than 2 years. I blow dry my hair about 3x/week. I am mindful not to coil it up or bend it when storing, however, with my less than average use, it has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Ever since my Chi hairdryer died I&#x27;ve been desperate for a good hairdryer. This is it. I have curly shoulder length hair that is VERY difficult to tame in humid weather. This dryer is great, good price and very light weight.</li>
    <li> The person received the dryer say it does a good  job drying and styling.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer.  It does dry my hair more quickly than previous dryers and honestly, my hair has more of a sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem, the buttons do seem somewhat out of place.  You can get used to it though.</li>
    <li> Good quality and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> What a great deal! This hairdryer set is exactly what I needed for my thick, curly hair. It&#x27;s easy to clean, hangs neatly on the wall, and the diffuser is the nicest I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I bought this 16 months ago. Unfortunately, it now has a bubble in the narrow arm that connects to the nozzle (from heat within) and a melted hole in the black plastic nozzle. I am afraid to use it any more so in the trash it goes. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy another.....</li>
    <li> Works great! Dries fast and is fairly quiet.</li>
    <li> I am updating because I want consumers to know that I did contact Revlon.  They offered to replace but I have already gotten a different hairdryer.  I told them I just wanted them to find out why this is happening to people and fix it.  They are sending me a label to send it back and are sending a refund.  Hopefully they really will take care of this problem.  If you have had yours catch fire, please call or email them so they are aware this is happening to more than one person.  They were very nice and seemed to want to get it fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally post negative reviews but this hairdryer just caught on fire!!  I looked through a few reveiws and see that someone else had the same issue.  I was drying my hair and the cord caught fire at the base of the dryer.  It scared me but I had the presence of mind to throw it in the sink.  I would have given it a 5 star (and think I might have) when I bought it in June of 2013.  I don&#x27;t think lasting less than 2 years and then catching on fire is good at all!</li>
    <li> I do like this hair dryer specially since I have curly hair and I like it straight. This product really does what it said . Ionic dryer help make curly hair smooth and straight,It leaves the hair very smooth and soft. Great product for an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this hair dryer! It will not last and will most likely stop working within 6 months with limited use as mine did.</li>
    <li> I like the attachments that were included with this. It&#x27;s a nice small size, good dryer settings and it shipped to me in good time.</li>
    <li> Its really amzing. Work&#x27;s good for my long hair. I loved it. :)</li>
    <li> very happy with this dryer. dries my hair fast with minimal frizz. the attachments stay on well. its also light weight, thats nice.</li>
    <li> Great buy! It works great! The speeds are perfect for low and high. I love the easy switch to turn off and on. My husband hates it because when he uses it he ends up hitting the button and it turns off. I don&#x27;t know why because I don&#x27;t have that problem😏</li>
    <li> I have really long hair that usually gets tangled when I blow it dry.  This thing drys my hair in minutes and leaves it tangle free.  HIGHLY recommended, especially at this price point.</li>
    <li> Good solid hair dryer and price that is hard to beat! Has all the basic features you need and gets the job done. No need to drop over $100 on other types of dryers.</li>
    <li> It serves the purpose.. I bought this to lightly dry my hair and not for any styling.. Powerful enough for the purpose..</li>
    <li> After a few months of very very light use, this dryer shot sparks out of its base and set my hair on fire.  BEWARE.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer, it was just what I was looking for! It&#x27;s light and fast. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so loud. Other than that should def buy!</li>
    <li> This thing is great, powerful and solid. I love that is has a little hook on it to hang up and it&#x27;s pretty attractive. Worth at least 3x this much...</li>
    <li> This started sparking and zapping about  2 months after purchase. I only used it for about 3-4 minutes a day (I have thin hair), 4 or so days a week. this is GARBAGE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I use the diffuser and it works great.  Very light weight compared to my old dryer.</li>
    <li> I was encouraged by the many positive reviews of this dryer, but I find it to be just average. It is very lightweight, but the body plastic feels very cheap to me and like it would crack easily if dropped. It has good heat and power, but I don&#x27;t feel like it de-frizzes any better than any non-tourmaline ionic ceramic dryer. The cord is very long, which could either be a plus or a minus depending on your situation.</li>
    <li> I bought this because so many reviewers said the diffuser was nice for wavy/ curly hair. It does dry my hair faster, but my wavy hair still looks like a bit of a poof instead of curly on top. I don&#x27;t think it reduces the frizz a whole lot, but it does some. Given the fact that it is lighter and dries faster I think it is still worth the low price.</li>
    <li> Great buy, and very light. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> the on/off switch is right where you grip and you accidentally shut it off while using it numerous times which is very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Great! Just what I was looking for at a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer- I usually don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, because it frizzes out and I worry about damage, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem. I love the diffuser attachment. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s great quality blowdryer at a great value.</li>
    <li> Very light, works well, received quickly.  Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Fantastic hair dryer!!! So happy I purchased this one. My mom used it today and it blew out her rollers in her hair LOL.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than my last pink revlon hair dryer that lasted for years!&lt;br /&gt;Love the extra settings for your hair and it dries my long hair super fast.&lt;br /&gt;New Year, New Hair Dryer!</li>
    <li> This is my first hair drier. It&#x27;s good and extremely convenient it has hot and warm modes and speeds low and high. Recommend it if anyone is buying a drier for first time.</li>
    <li> nice dryer, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Excellent, hot, fast, love it.</li>
    <li> Its a really nice hairdrier. Serves the purpose. Has got tempetature and speed controls. The best thing is the coolair flow option, which really helps in protecting hairs after styling.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. Works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like it if it was a bit more powerful, but it does its job. Takes a little longer to dry my hair than usual though.</li>
    <li> Very light, not too noisy.  I bought this for my kids.  I have long hair so I prefer the Babyliss Pro for blasting air at my hair and drying quickly, but this hairdryer works well for my kids and husband.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair dryer for 2 months and it already stopped working (and I don&#x27;t even use it every day). Extremely disappointed...</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair. This dries my hair in 10 minutes.  And it&#x27;s light weight doesn&#x27;t tire me out.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. It may have been just been my old and cheap hairdryer, but this one really does dry faster, and my hair is less frizzy and more shiny using this one. Plus my hair doesn&#x27;t smell like it is burning, which is a huge bonus.</li>
    <li> Bought this a year ago, still using it with no problems. My hair breaks easy and is super fine so it sticks up like a &#x27;fro if I&#x27;m not careful when blowdrying. This dryer seems to keep both those issues at a minimum. Great value.</li>
    <li> Very good dryer. Lasts a long time. Dries fast.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best blow dryer.  It is cheap, light weight, and dries my medium length thick hair FAST!  It saves me loads of time in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this blow dryer so much, I bought 3 of them just in case  mine stopped working.</li>
    <li> simple product do the job for drying me little kids hear after shower</li>
    <li> I got this at exact 1 year ago (I just checked my purchase date).  It was very good until just now. It made scary electric sound and big spark came out from it when I turned it on and used for 1 min.&lt;br /&gt;After reading other reviews, I feel lucky that my hand was not burned and I will just get rid of it and buy some other brands.</li>
    <li> For this one time I used it I noticed difference . Hear is not as freeze and it feels like you just left hear salon . I am giving only 4 stars because I have not had chance to use it long enough. If it is durable it will get 5th star.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this junk product. It is dead after using 10 times.</li>
    <li> The sale price is good.  About the same as other hair dryers, so yes, I would recommend it.  Only real draw back is not having the handle fold up</li>
    <li> The hairdryer itself works great. But both attachments don&#x27;t fit. They are too small. I called Revlon which directed me to another company and they are sending me new attachments. They stated this was the second time they have had an Amazon customer call with the same problem.</li>
    <li> The good:  Dries quickly...leaves hair smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  The tip get WAY too hot, I burned my hands a couple times.  Even the concentrator melted a bit.  Both  attachments fit loosely, the concentrator always moved when I was drying my hair.  The worse issue with this dryer is that is the way it died.  The cord started sparking while I was drying my hair and then caught on fire.  Thank goodness I was able to put it out without any damage  to anyone or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer died after 12 months, not sure how I feel about this because it was a bargain at $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only want to spend $20ish bucks..this is a good option.</li>
    <li> Terrific product.  Really does the job fast and safely. Right price.  Much. much MUCH better than a way expensive had dryer I bought that broke after one year.</li>
    <li> It is the best blow dryer at this price.  It is lightweight and dries my very thick quickly as compared to any other dryer.</li>
    <li> my daughter has a $500 blow dryer and I swear I love this one just as much.  It&#x27;s smooth even heat and the dryer is lightweight.  controls are easy to use with one hand.  the attachments are good as well.  I am very pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife. She loves it very much</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. it is the first that I have gotten that has a diffuser attachment, which is the primary reason why I bought it. So far I am enjoying this dryer and all the settings that he has. As a naturally curl girl (4a, 4b hair), I am apprehensive to use a lot of heat on my hair.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome blow drier, period. But add how lightweight it is and how inexpensive it was, and you&#x27;ve got a real winner! I bought this for my teen daughter who hates to blow dry her hair because it&#x27;s to her waist and all one length (which means it&#x27;s heavy n takes forever to dry) but she&#x27;s happy with this one! It&#x27;s very lightweight, easy to use, and dries hair quickly.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer works for me and it&#x27;s cheap! I have short hair and it dries my hair fast. A+!!!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair and it is very hard to dry.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is powerful and easy to use. Recommend it~</li>
    <li> This dryer just crapped out on me this morning (with mouse in my hair) after only 7 months. It was fine up until then, but I think it should have lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Very quiet and easy to use.  I use the defuser for my curls and works much better than my old one.  I would recommend this to anyone interested!</li>
    <li> I did not have any budget problem when i decided to buy a blow dryer with a diffuser. searching online for days for the best product, I bought this due to having the highest review rates, but I guess the reviews are misleading. Even at the low setting it produces frizz. Since I bought it i have used it only three times. I&#x27;d rather have my permed hair air dried than having frizz after working on it for 45 minutes.</li>
    <li> This light weight dryer dries my hair quickly without frying it due to the Warm setting on high.  I&#x27;ve been buying Tourmaline / Ionic dryers for years and would not consider buying any other.  It&#x27;s quieter than my other dryers too.  I like the defuser for days when I want to go with my natural curly look without having to wait for it to air dry.  It&#x27;s a steal on Amazon compared to my $100 dryers that do the same thing.  I was intending on leaving this one at my son&#x27;s home when I visit him, but after using it I brought it back home with me and will leave another of my high priced dryers there the next time I visit.</li>
    <li> Really great hair dryer.  It truly dries my hair in half they time it took with a traditional hair dryer.  My hair actually feels healthier using the tourmaline/ceramic/ion technology.  Great price too!!!</li>
    <li> This dryer is amazing!!!  I have extremely thick, long hair and it took less than 10 mins to dry my hair!!!!  My hair feels amazing too!!!</li>
    <li> Pros: Easy To Use; Controls Frizz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: High heat setting can be intense, awkward placement of buttons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is spot - on! I really like how the hot setting is not too hot; that&#x27;s what can cause the frizzies. I have long hair on top, short on sides and it&#x27;s wavy. This dryer is not so powerful that it makes my hair straight, yet has ample power to&lt;br /&gt;dry it in normal drying time. The switches are kind of touchy so it is easy to accidentally hit one and change your setting while drying hair but that is the only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I have. And the price was great; have purchased other dryers in the past that were much more expensive with much worse results!</li>
    <li> The hairdryer work fine for the first few months. Unfortunately six months after I bought it the hairdryer stopped working I tried to use the reset button in the plug but it doesn&#x27;t work anymore</li>
    <li> I purchased this recently because my old dryer took a poop and decided to set a small amount of my hair on fire.  Essentially, anything that dried my hair but didn&#x27;t set it on fire was going to be an improvement.  My last dryer had this sweet attachment that would spin my hair around like a damn helicopter but give me these great beach waves.  I searched and searched but could not find any dryer with that same attachment so I settled on this one.  It works well, there are high and low settings for speed and heat as well as a cooling feature.  It&#x27;s a hair dryer.  Doesn&#x27;t set my hair on fire.  Win.</li>
    <li> I bought this to diffuse my thick, curly hair.  The attachments work great and stay in place with no effort.  The dryer&#x27;s temperature and perfect and it keeps my hair from getting very frizzy.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! I&#x27;m on the second one in a year and today, the cord sparked and caught fire as I was using it.&lt;br /&gt;DANGEROUS!!!</li>
    <li> So easy to use and it dries the hair easily with silky finish. Great product.</li>
    <li> Hassle free transaction,  had it for about two months no complaints.  Super light weight,  stylish and I have not seen sparks or other over heating signs.</li>
    <li> I have had no issues with this product.  It works well and is a good product for the relatively small price.</li>
    <li> Great dryer and small size.  The price is perfect and works great.  No complaints</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this hair dryer in November and it suddenly stopped turning on.  Tried multiple outlets and and the reset buttons on the plug.  The vent is free of lint, so the cause shouldn&#x27;t be overheating.  Given that it only lasted 5 months, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This worked fine till the motor stopped working and it started smoking. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting this one. I can&#x27;t even return it now that it&#x27;s out of the return window.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a hair dryer expert, but I did a bit of research before purchasing this hair dryer and am glad I did.  For the money, you can&#x27;t beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so lightweight!  My hand or arm doesn&#x27;t get tired at all while drying my hair, which is quite a feat because my hair is wavy/curly so I use low speed and the diffuser.  It takes maybe 10 minutes to dry my hair on low.  And the diffuser works beautifully, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy, so I am very happy with it.  It&#x27;s a bargain!</li>
    <li> I love, love, LOVE this hair dryer!  Lightweight, temp is just right, the attachments stay secure (I&#x27;ve experienced some that have flown across my bathroom floor), it&#x27;s quiet, switches are in a good place, even the cord impresses me, super flexible.  Not this stiff plastic cord that can just be annoying.  For the price and quality, I would recommend this to anyone!!!  Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> I had an older model of this dryer for years and it worked great. It eventually shorted out so I bought the current model and it&#x27;s even better. My drying time is cut in half. This thing has a lot of power.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer, really useful. Like it! The price is quite reasonable, and it is enough for the daily use.</li>
    <li> lightweight.  easy to hold. well designed buttons.  nice attachments that stay on. Finally!</li>
    <li> Pretty good blowdryer. This does exactly what I need it to do for a great price. Love the attachments that come with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a quiet Conair Ionic Hair Dryer which I&#x27;ve had for several years (still works), but I thought I should retire it for a newer model.  The first couple of months the dryer was ok.  It was loud, but light and powerful which is great because I have very thick hair and lots of it.  But after the first two months, the dryer must have had some wiring issues because it would stop running unless you had the cord held just right... totally inconvenient, but I could deal with it.  Well this morning, same routine... hold the cord just so and spark, spark, and boom, a little flame? Quickly unplugged the dryer and the outer covering of cord was smoking and melted.  Hair still wet, so pulled out the old Conair and old reliable did the job.  Obviously this Revlon dryer is already in the trash and now I&#x27;ll be searching for its replacement, but not a Revlon brand, a Conair hair dryer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hairdryer and does what a hairdryer should.</li>
    <li> Awesome hairdryer and great price.  It works better than the $100.00 ones.  I have curly long hair and this blow dryer do the job in less time that an expensive one that I had.</li>
    <li> It is powerful and not noisy. little bit bigger but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer. I&#x27;ve had it for two years and its lasted for me. It was worth the money and I love the diffuser it comes with.</li>
    <li> Bought this hair dryer for my wife for Xmas and she loved it but 7 months later it goes on and off at will. We don&#x27;t wrap the cord and just lay it in the drawer. We&#x27;ve had other brands last a few years or more. Poorly made and disappointed. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for $18.</li>
    <li> I brought this dryer because my old comb attachment dryer was dying. I have always used those and thought they were the best,but I am now very impressed with this dryer. I have medium length hair and it dries my hair much faster than the old one. It is very light weight and easy on your hand. A great dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> It was good when it still worked. It broke after 2 years of usage.  I was expecting it to work a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Best selling hairdryer, that is what attracted me to this item. When my wife needed one, and she asked me to search for the best one, the price of this one blew me away. It heats fast, and the powerful motor fully satisfies her needs. She loves it, and thinks I paid $100 more than what I did.</li>
    <li> 8/12/2014, Brought this hair dryer in April.  It was on fire during the use this morning!! Stay away from using it!!</li>
    <li> Works great has power</li>
    <li> This was great while it lasted!  I purchased two years ago and motor burnt out today and started smoking.  I used it about 4 times a week.</li>
    <li> The title says it all ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the fancy ones first and noticed that this one was lighter, smoother air flow, and dried my medium thick/curly hair within 10 minutes. Definitely recommend for any hair type.</li>
    <li> This is much lighter and much less powerful than I expected from reading all the previous reviews.  Although I still like it, I probably would not purchase again As I have very long, thick hair and it takes much longer to dry with this than most 1875 W dryers.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  UPDATE: After ONLY 4 months of minimal use I was drying my hair and the end of the cord that attaches to the dryer sparked and burned my hair!  Needless to say I was terrified.  I called AMAZON and got a full refund on this obviously defective and dangerous blow dryer.  When searching for this review to update, I read many, many reviews stating the same thing or even worse!!  THIS BLOW DRYER NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM AMAZON BEFORE IT REALLY HURTS SOMEONE!!</li>
    <li> I own this since 5years . I donot use it everyday but only when I wash my hair which is once a week . I used it daily for my small baby in winters after her bath. This is good product. I never had any problems!</li>
    <li> Works great, replacing a almost ten year old dryer. Was a day earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I have no hair, half  by choice, the other half gave me no choice.  Wife loves it though.  She especially loves the diffuser.  Walmart was cheaper we found after the fact.</li>
    <li> My expensive T3 dryer finally died and I did not want to send a lot of money replacing it. I read the excellent reviews on this dryer and the price was great so I decided to try it. It&#x27;s great. It dries my hair much faster than my old pricey dryer and has helped keep the frizzies down a bit. I think I was able to dry my chin length hair in about 3 minutes this morning.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Nice dryer.  The body doesn&#x27;t get hot so you can hold it anywhere.  Just what I was looking for.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Too hot - had to send it back.</li>
    <li> This Dryer is a pistol!  Perfect heat and power.  Both attachments work properly.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> This dryer was good while it lasted.. but after maybe a month, it got a short in the cord, and as I was drying my hair one day, it blew up.. the back blew off, it sparked, almost caught my hair on fire, and left a burn mark on my hand..</li>
    <li> I got this to replace an old Revlon that my mom had.  Works great!  The attachments seem to be superfluous, or they are for me, because I don&#x27;t really know what the point is.  But the hair dryer on its own is great even if you don&#x27;t consider the attachments.  Dries my hair quickly and efficiently.</li>
    <li> It was fine as a dryer but broke already!  Something inside it just broke and fell out.  Wasn&#x27;t over used for sure.  Once every 2 or 3 days.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> Love the cold shot feature in this Dryer, Its very easy to use and never gets too hot even after continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciable cord length and quick dryer attachments come in handy for the Mrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars well deserved.</li>
    <li> Great hairdryer. It is gentle and does not burn my scalp or my hair. The diffuser works great with my curls. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The main reason I bought this was because it was advertised as being quiet. It IS NOT. It a decent normal noisy hair dryer.</li>
    <li> First one lasted less than 4 months; ordered a new one but it would not even start and had to return it. Contacted Revlon but they referred me to Helen of Troy who manufactures it saying they would contact me; they have not.</li>
    <li> Great little dryer for the price.  I have nearly waist length curly hair so we will see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> enjoying the device. and what command for others looking for a good hair dryer.</li>
    <li> It is light weight and easy to hold for long periods of time</li>
    <li> Awesome! Lightweight, fast drying, and not noisy! All you want and more in a blow dryer!!! The diffuser is a great tool for my curly hair!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the Revlon RV/544 in April 2011 for less than $20. I went through three Bespoke Labs T3 dryers for tons of money (one was replaced at minimal cost by Bespoke), and decided to try inexpensive dryers. The Revlon RV/544 and the Andis RC-2 with retractable cord (need travel dryer a couple times a week) had very good reviews so I bought both. They are both great dryers! I have mid-length, very curly, color treated hair that I style smooth and then finish with a flat iron so power that won&#x27;t fry my hair or make my hair frizzy is important to me. Also, I am petite and holding a heavy dryer with my arms up is not easy, and both  dryers are very lightweight (years ago I was using wonderful, older technology Elchim and Supersolano hair blowers that I just can&#x27;t hold up anymore). The Revlon purchased in April 2011 just broke and I just bought another one. I was tempted to buy another Andis now instead, but I think I&#x27;ll wait until it breaks before getting another. It&#x27;s just not worth spending between $200 and $300 for a hair blower that doesn&#x27;t do the job any better or last longer than the Revlon. Kudos to Revlon for a great product!    December 2014 Update: Bought first one April 2011 and it broke. Bought second one 1 year 8 months later in December 2012 and it broke. Bought third one 1 year 3 months later in March 2014 and it appears to be on its way out; after only 9 months it is making noises like it is going to grind up inside and start burning up like the last one did. Disappointed, but can&#x27;t afford another T3 so I guess I&#x27;ll buy RV544 number four.</li>
    <li> works great.  does not get as hot as my old one but it does not need to.  very good power and a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my guest bathroom in May of 2013.  It probably has only been used 10 times.  My mom went to use it today and it is now working intermittently which means the wire has a loose connection somewhere.  What a disappointment.  I would not spend the money on this!</li>
    <li> This was a great hairdryer while it lasted, but recently (after owning it less than 9 months) it&#x27;s started to randomly power off during usage.</li>
    <li> Very powerful blow dryer. Pretty large however.</li>
    <li> Junk. Lasted 1 year, now doesn&#x27;t even turn on, or when it does it shuts right off</li>
    <li> Needed a dryer that was quiet and works fast. I totally love this one and its attachments. Does everything I need it to and more!</li>
    <li> What a great deal! And good hair dryer for nice hair!</li>
    <li> It has been working like a champ ever since I bought it</li>
    <li> This dryer works great. It dries your hair so quickly. I have short hair, so it takes a few minutes to dry my hair and it saves me a lot of time in the morning.</li>
    <li> worked great for about 2 weeks. Turned on one morning and I heard a shattering sound inside the unit and shards of plastic started coming out whilst the unit was still running! Cheap, Cheap. Could have some some serious damage if i was blow drying my hair at the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer based on reviews. It lasted me less than six months of daily use. I expected it to last at least a year! It was fine while it lasted, but I won&#x27;t purchase this model again.</li>
    <li> Showed up with a dent and the temp button was upside down. Obviously refurbished!</li>
    <li> My husband got me this dryer for christmas and I am overall really satisfied. It dries my hair in half the time of my old dryer. I have less fly aways and my hair seems less dry and damaged. It is also relatively light and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get the full 5 Stars is because it tends to suck in my hair quite often. Didn&#x27;t have that happen with my old dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is extremely lightweight compared to the dryer I had before. It dries hair fast and I really like it.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer works great for my curly hair. My only complaint is that there&#x27;s not enough room to hold onto the dryer without accidentally changing settings.</li>
    <li> This is a light weight, powerful, not overly noisy model.  It does the trick for drying long or short hair quickly.  Have not used the diffuser but it otherwise works well.  It is not a compact dryer so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d pack it for travel but great for home.  No problems with the controls as some had mentioned accidentlly turning it off.  Good price and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one!</li>
    <li> Dries thick hair very quickly and smoothly.</li>
    <li> Makes huge noise now. Guess the fan is loosen but I could not open it to fix</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased a hair dryer in many year, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when this arrived.  However, I was amazed at how quickly this dried my hair!  I have naturally curly hair, so the diffuser attachment is essential.  What a great buy!</li>
    <li> Love it,hair dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t frizz. Good for the price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and light so your arms don&#x27;t get tired :-) but it&#x27;s also very powerful</li>
    <li> I chose to buy this hair dryer because of the great reviews and comparability to the T3. I didn&#x27;t like how the hot setting was too hot and the warm setting was not hot enough.  I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for less than 2 years (purchased in May of 2011) and it just broke--it won&#x27;t turn on anymore. I&#x27;ve had cheaper hair dryers last 10+ years! Would not purchase again. :/</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for a close friend and she loves the hairdryer. I would definitely recommend and will be buying myself one soon.</li>
    <li> A really great dryer for any type hair, love the defuser for when you want curls or waves, above what I expected.</li>
    <li> Works well, daughter loves it</li>
    <li> We have had trouble with these hair dryers.  The first one had to be discarded when the cord came away from the handle creating a fire hazard (literally, we saw sparks).  The second started to cut out after only one year.</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use and I like the powerful way it has. HOWEVER, it got broken within 5 months!  Some parts inside had poor connection. I had to shake it hard and once in a while it would work again for a few seconds and stop working again.</li>
    <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a long time.  I didn&#x27;t realize my old hair dryer was dragging me down until I used this one.  My hair has been consistently more shiny and healthy with this dryer.  Not a lot of settings but I don&#x27;t need them.</li>
    <li> Quality hair dryer that performs well.</li>
    <li> DID NOT LIKE IT, IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK IN MY COUNTRY. I got it working and it´s not very powerfull. would not repurchase</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t blow dry properly</li>
    <li> First off, shame on me for buying a $15 hair dryer, however, I previously always bought my hair dryers (99% of the time Revlon brand) from Kohl&#x27;s with those coupons they always give out and those dryers lasted for years! This one lasted for 8 months and then this morning just stopped working out of nowhere. The back is not clogged with dust, it&#x27;s actually very clean still. It didn&#x27;t overheat because I had just turned it on. The wires are fine and still intact. No idea why it stopped working but I can only assume it was because it was a cheapo $15 one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend.</li>
    <li> This lasted only a short while before it acquired a quirk: it wouldn&#x27;t come on when switched on. Then it would, IF you held it in a certain position only: high above your head at a certain angle. OK, I could live with that, though it was very awkward, to say the least (isn&#x27;t the point of a blow dryer to be able to move it around your head in different positions!?!? )&lt;br /&gt; A few weeks later, there was a flash--. No, Surely I was imagining things. The next day, it threw off large orange sparks and little sparks of, well, fire. Luckily they hit the floor and not my hair. Or I would have been even more upset than I was.&lt;br /&gt;This dryer hits the trash.&lt;br /&gt;What a lemon.&lt;br /&gt;To say I&#x27;m disappointed is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to the $3 hairdryer I bought at Goodwill......at least it&#x27;s safe.......</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel silky and smooth. Easy to use and not too loud. I love that there are two temperatures and it dries my hair quickly even on warm. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had no idea there was really a difference in hair dryers until I got this one. This thing is amazing! The diffuser is literally the size of a small dessert plate and the &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; are much longer than I expected. The concentrator works miracles for giving lift and height to my crown area! And the price can&#x27;t be beat. For 20+ years I have been using the cheapest hair dryer(s) on the market and damaging my hair in the process. I wish I had known about and bought this dryer years ago. Awesome product, incredible price!</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It&#x27;s quiet and works so well on my thick curly hair. I have had other hair by far this one is the best.</li>
    <li> We had this item for just under a year and a half, and the last time our son used it sparks shot out of the item and it died. This was not just a few sparks, but rather an eruption of sparks that left black marks all over his shirt. I consider this a serious malfunction and one that any buyer should really not want to have to worry about while using such an item in their bathroom. Think carefully about using this regularly over any extended period of time.</li>
    <li> Good for straight hair, but not for curly hair. I wish it came with a comb attachment. I can&#x27;t even find an attachment for this dryer online.</li>
    <li> It worked great for awhile but the cord has worn where it connects to the unit. I am having to replace it because it cuts on and off and it is shooting sparks out occasionally. Definitely on it&#x27;s last leg....</li>
    <li> I purchased this Revlon hair dryer to replace an older model of the same hair dryer that lasted for 7 - 8 years. This one lasted five months. It loses power several times in the middle of drying my hair. I think it is due to faulty wiring in the cord. I spend a lot of time trying to position the dryer so it will work. The smell of burning wire is growing stronger. Too late to return it - I will throw it away today.</li>
    <li> I bought mine three weeks ago and it already stopped working. It won&#x27;t turn on at all. Hunk of junk</li>
    <li> it works fine, but I have real long hair, and once a strand of hair got caught in the back end of the hair dryer.. so anyhow I really stick to air drying now most of the times. nothing got stuck on the end where the diffuse was though..</li>
    <li> Does the job and quickly at that.</li>
    <li> We ordered this after pouring over reviews to find the best possible dryer.  So far it seems to be living up to the hype.  It comes with a diffuser and concentrator which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful and fast, dries hair quickly and the cold shot button gives more shine to my hair that our old dryer did.  One great feature that I hadn&#x27;t noticed before I ordered, is that the back end opens so you can clean out dust.  This should be really helpful as that&#x27;s how most of my old dryers burned out.  Overall it seems like a very good value.</li>
    <li> This was actually not a bad hair dryer for nearly a year.  Then while using it one day,  big sparks shot out of the base of the cord, singeing my arm.  I immediately dropped it and fortunately, my hair didn&#x27;t catch on fire.  This went straight into the trash.  I&#x27;d never trust this brand again.</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer over a week ago to replace an old mini-styler I had. So far it works great. Seems to dry my hair much quicker than my old dryer and the attachments are just want I need to go from curly to straight styles. I have medium-thick, very long hair. It&#x27;s really nice how light weight the dryer is too because my hair gets exhausted with some other models trying to blow-out my hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t blow as much as my old one.</li>
    <li> This is better quality than I expected. I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this hair dryer with the diffuser, but it works great for me. I like being able to choose heat and speed settings depending on how much time I have.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer! It&#x27;s light, and a great hair dryer. Before this hair dryer I was using the Chi hair dryer that is about $100. Well, this hair dryer is lighter and just as good as the Chi. I cannot stand using a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; hair dryer. I like using the ionic ceramic kind. Works better for my thick wavy hair. I use it daily and it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Excellent dryer.  Not tool loud.  Temp changes instantly when you change settings.</li>
    <li> Moderate pricing, good value, performs as expected.</li>
    <li> Working great so far!</li>
    <li> I like this product, it&#x27;s a good hair dryer, but the on/off switch was placed where it can be easily turned off while in use.</li>
    <li> Worked great until it died 9 months after I bought it, with non-daily use.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has all the elements you need in a hair dryer I think this is the best thing you able to buy with your money as far as hair dryers go. What I mean to say is its a good hair dyer and it will get the job done in a blink of any eye without any problems</li>
    <li> LOVE this hairdryer! Lots of power, with multiple settings and kind to your hair. My daughter has one also; after I used hers, I knew I would replace my old dryer with this model.</li>
    <li> Very competent and quiet.  Pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this blow dryer, which has heat and power, but after just a few months of owning it, the wire caught fire and shorted out. That risk is never worth it, especially with hardware that is relatively new.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, easy to handle, very efficient</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works great! Especially with the concentrator attachment. My hair is always left shiny and smooth!</li>
    <li> This is a nice size, not too big.  Some reviews have talked about the buttons are easy to turn it off while drying your hair, and while I have had that happen, I&#x27;ve learned to hold it differently and now it doesn&#x27;t happen at all, it&#x27;s not a problem.  My old dryer was so bad that anything would have been an improvement (smile), but I&#x27;ve had no issues or frustrations with this one.</li>
    <li> This dryer is light and easy to use. However, I wanted to edit my review since it broke after eight months. I really liked the dryer, but it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> can as expected, when expected and I would recommend this product to friends and coworkers</li>
    <li> Works well at drying my hair without blowing it too hard.  Just wish it had a retractable cord but other than that am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works great! Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> Excellent product！Excellent seller！</li>
    <li> Not bad as compared to other hair dryers. Quite affordable and easy to use. Just that we need to plug in to a power adapter first for use here.</li>
    <li> The dryer itself is good: quiet, dries quickly, and the cold/warm/hot settings are handy. The reason I gave it four stars was because of the diffuser. It does stay on well, unlike my old blow dryer&#x27;s that popped right off each time, but it does nothing good for my hair. My hair is thick and wavy/curly and I was looking for a blow dryer with a good diffuser since it helps make my hair wavier and overall better-looking. This diffuser literally does nothing, it just prevents the air from coming out so strong in my opinion. I hope I can find a separate diffuser somewhere that would fit this particular blow dryer, because I am satisfied with it. Just wish they would make a diffuser that is more effective.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy such a cheap blow dryer after reading several reviews about how cheaper ones have simply stopped working, sparked, etc. I was more than pleasantly surprised to get a quiet (FINALLY) and light styler, which works incredibly well on my thin and semi damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on Monday night and it was on my doorstep by Friday. Two thumbs way up!</li>
    <li> Got this for my friend across the country. Got to them promptly and friend loved it!</li>
    <li> great hair dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> perfect design, worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great price for great product!</li>
    <li> Great price for this product- works perfectly and I&#x27;ve had no issues. Pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This product lasted 4 months before it died.  I have not had a hair dryer that died as quickly, therefore, I would not repurchase another Revlon dryer nor recommend them.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! And an awesome price!</li>
    <li> The best hairdryer ever. I have a ton of hair and it&#x27;s very thick so it usually takes forever to dry, but not with this hairdryer, it blows very strong and hot, and it&#x27;s very light to hold. Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer in January 2014 and totally loved it - it works great.  However, yesterday (September 2014) while drying my hair I heard a crackle sound and then flames came out of the base (where the cord attaches).  Never have had something like that happen before!  Luckily I was not holding it near my hair when the flames appeared or using it on my daughter.  Dangerous product!</li>
    <li> the best hair dryer that i have ever owned</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m beginning to hate this thing... much too heavy and big. With the air diffuser attached and you need to do the back of your head, it&#x27;s like trying to point a sawed-off shotgun to the back of my head and it&#x27;s just as heavy.  I may not wait until it dies to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original:&lt;br /&gt;Kinda of heavy and a bit too big, but it works</li>
    <li> This dryer works well on my fine thin hair and is easy to use. I never use hot air. The only thing I&#x27;d like to have is a medium heat sometimes. It seems that it&#x27;s a bit warmer if I set it high air and low heat.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer ever, and so inexpensive!  I have tried expensive, professional brand hair dryers (Chi, Babyliss) and this one is much better.  Not only does it dry quickly, it is also extremely lightweight.  This is my second dryer purchase of this Revlon.  The first one died after several years....maybe 5 years or so.  Acceptable, since I use it daily.  Please Revlon, do not discontinue this dryer.  If you buy this, you can&#x27;t go wrong ladies!</li>
    <li> The diffuser really helps dry curly or permed hair nicely.&lt;br /&gt;It is not the most powerful blow dryer, doesnt work the fastest but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> A very good haïr drayer, worth thé price you have paid.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional hairdresser, so I cannot compare this dryer to a professional model.  I am a hair-drying wimp, however, complaining that my previous dryers were too heavy to hold over my head!  This dryer is much lighter, however, and I have no issues with the weight!  I use the diffuser, and since I am petite, I end up holding the dryer by the barrel while drying my hair.  My arm does not get tired, and the barrel doesn&#x27;t get too hot to handle.  I love this dryer &amp; wish I had gotten it sooner!</li>
    <li> I really love this dryer but I&#x27;m buying another one 6 months later because mine just broke. I use it very often, like 3-4 times a week. One of the helix plates broke and it was stuck inside it... I know this because my father opened it, which I could never do because he needed many tools, it&#x27;s totally not made to be fixed. Since it&#x27;s so light weight, I&#x27;ll buy it again and wish that won&#x27;t happen again. But be aware this is probably not the best option for a frequent user.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very bulky and bit tough for me handle it.&lt;br /&gt;Also the location of on and off button is bit akward.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to turn the dryer off while trying to manuever it.</li>
    <li> It works well. It&#x27;s light and easy to handle.</li>
    <li> Excelente!! aunque de dimensiones un poco grandes</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a very good dryer. It has hot/warm settings and a diffuser that comes in handy drying my toddler&#x27;s curls. The only negative is, it is VERY loud. I wouldn&#x27;t let that stop me from purchasing it again- but if you have sensitive ears you may consider that when purchasing.</li>
    <li> Less than 2 months later and the dryer stopped working</li>
    <li> It is OK with enough power</li>
    <li> Used once.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair dryer - very light, quiet enough, and gentle on my longer aging hair.  I&#x27;ve tried many different models and this one is the best for my hair, unfortunately like so many things made in China these days, super poor quality.  They constantly break, sometimes after only a couple months of use - start making loud whining sounds, or go off and on like they are shorting out, etc - however, very cheap so I just keep ordering more of them because I can&#x27;t find anything better - especially for the money.  Ordering two more tonight.</li>
    <li> I was in search for a blowdryer that was lightweight and quick drying.  Also needed one that didn&#x27;t tangle my hair because it blew out of control!  This one is perfect.  Powerful but doesn&#x27;t cause tangles, easy to hold and operate, and inexpensive.  Had for over a year now with no issues.  It also has a VERY long cord which is a bonus.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> The only hassle is the knob which is used to increase the heat of the hot air which seems very fragile to work with. Other than that, it&#x27;s light and quite silent. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Very good affordable Ionic hair dryer - I think it makes a difference in how soft and shiny my hair is compared to my old hair dryer.</li>
    <li> It was delivered in time. It works great.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER.  DOESN&#x27;T DRY OUT MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> Has great settings. Works quickly. Well built and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this blow dryer simply because I can blow out my hair straight if I really wanted to but mostly I use it with the diffuser because that is a curly girl&#x27;s best friend I love this dryer it doesn&#x27;t overheat and allowed me to call my hair down very quickly without damaging it best thing I have ever bought</li>
    <li> Works great. Dries my thick hair in record time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big reviewer, but I felt the need to speak. I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 10 months and have loved it (good heat, excellent air flow, cheap price) up until a few days ago. The last time I used it it started to throw sparks and burned through the two shirts I was wearing and singed my skin. I don&#x27;t think this is a normal occurrence, but it happened to me -- be warned! Before the sparks, I would have recommended this dryer wholeheartedly (5 stars).</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve had in a while! I wish I had bought it sooner. It dries my hair quickly without it feeling burnt or frizzy. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have super thick hair and this dryer just wasn&#x27;t drying my hair fast enough, gave it to my niece who has thin hair and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Since my previous hair dryer was on the fritz, I decided to purchase this one due to the good reviews. I have a little above the shoulder hair and my hair drying time has decrease by 50%. I would always hate drying my hair after I took a shower because it took so long, but now, I don&#x27;t mind! Very happy!</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and does what it is supposed to do.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Worth the money great blow dryer.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works well except that it shorts out after only a few months of use!  The first one started sparking from the wiring!   The second one shorted out after a few months and now has stopped working entirely!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t understand why this gets such rave reviews and is the bestseller. It&#x27;s so generic and there&#x27;s nothing special about it. Works fine, fairly lightweight, good price. Why the hype?</li>
    <li> This hairdryer worked okay, but it caught on fire this morning, so it&#x27;s extremely dangerous &amp; that&#x27;s a deal breaker for me.  I&#x27;ve had it less than a year.  I&#x27;ve had other hair dryers last 10 years!  I called Revlon &amp; they gave me the number for Helen of Troy who is the  manufacturer (800-487-7273 in case any of you have the same problem).  They are sending me a label to return it &amp; will replace it with another model.  I guess that&#x27;s the best they can do, but the model they are sending is a new one &amp; there are only few reviews on it, none very good, so I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll be getting something worse.  Will probably reorder something else.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair dryer for not a lot of money! No problems so far.</li>
    <li> really good and nice. best dryer i ever had. definitely worth this prize</li>
    <li> one of the best. everyone around me thinks this is an expensive dryer. It is one of the best</li>
    <li> Good dryer which is doing the job it needs!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a hairdryer, nothing special, it does what it says.</li>
    <li> It dries hair really fast but makes my hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> After I got this, I feel like I have healthier hair than before. This is really durable and strong. Also, It reduces the time required to dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer about three years ago and, after two years of use, suddenly smoke started coming out of it and left a horrible stench.  Because I liked it so well up to that point (it really does dry your hair quickly), and hoping it was just a fluke, I bought another one.  Now, 10 months later, it only works if you hold the cord in a certain position. I am going to have to throw it out before it catches fire.  Time to find a new brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this blow dryer forma me and my cockapoo, Justo tested it con him yesterday and ir leaves his hair SO soft, im in love. I use the diffuser forma muy curly hair and ir works great :) gives me a good amount of volume and it leaves my hair shiny and soft. I also like that it is very lightweight, i feel like i could spend hours using it without getting tired.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with purchase</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy..!!</li>
    <li> Lasted less than 2 months before switching itself off for good.  End of life luckily wasn&#x27;t as dramatic compared to other reviews I read too late (no sparks).</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. The diffuser works great for my curly hair! Look no further the best hair dryer is here!</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she didn&#x27;t seem completely thrilled when she opened it. I think she was hoping for something that was the &#x27;big bucks&#x27; item that you see advertised. I asked her to try it and if it didn&#x27;t meet her expectations than I would send it back and get something better. Well it was just perfect for her and it has most of the bells and whistles that she wanted. Very lightweight, gentle airflow, quiet, tourmaline ionic and lots of power. Don&#x27;t buy the big expensive dryer until you try this one!</li>
    <li> I liked this hairdryer, but kept it hanging by its cord for a brief time, and now it flickers on and off during regular use. Sadly, it would probably cost more to fix than replace, so I&#x27;m in the market for a new one, but I suppose it&#x27;s my own fault for hanging it by the cord. It tended to get a little too hot while on the hot setting, but the cool blast button took care of that. I&#x27;d recommend it for an inexpensive option that works pretty quickly. Never used the diffuser attachment so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but the concentrator worked well.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer! I found reviews on consumersearch.com and bought the dryer on Amazon. Highly recommend the dryer! It&#x27;s quiet and gets the job done quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great! Recommended&lt;br /&gt;Dries hair fast.&lt;br /&gt;Two heat option is good.</li>
    <li> This was a good hairdryer for almost five years - which, in terms of hairdryer lifespan, is pretty good, I think. But a few weeks ago, one of the inner coils started overheating, making an awful noise and a lot of burning smells. I&#x27;ll probably purchase a different model for my next hairdryer, but this was a solid purchase while it lasted.</li>
    <li> Power is lacking, my mini wall dryer had more power. Overall it&#x27;s just ok. Should have bought a wall unit instead.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, plenty of heat; and it&#x27;s quiet, too--all for a great price with extras!  I made a great choice and you will too!</li>
    <li> I thought it was just me but i figured i would wait till my wife used it to see if she came to the same conclusion. Sure enough she did! It just doesnt blow out enough air on high. Perhaps our old dryer was to good to compare to this one? Our old one lasted about 7 years of heavy use but on high, it would really throw the air out! This one sounds like its really throwing out the air but its not.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because it had good reviews and was listed as the number one seller.  I&#x27;m not as thrilled with this as I thought I would be.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months, and though it still works well, sometimes it gets that &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; smell which really bothers me.  I also hear something pop in it once in a while, which freaks me out when it happens.  I also can hear something rattling in it, like something got knocked loose.  I think in the end I would rather a hair dryer that is a higher quality.</li>
    <li> For $20, this hair dryer rocks.  I&#x27;ve never had such a light weight hair dryer that drys my hair so quickly.  The switches are in the proper place and the power is great.  I&#x27;ve owned it for two weeks now.  I wish it had a cord that would retract, but beggers can&#x27;t be choosers eh?  I mean it.  You will not be dissapointed....and all of the attachments that came with it.  (I&#x27;ve never used these).</li>
    <li> no other words, simply perfect!&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t even look at anything else and waste any more of your time, just buy it! this product will super exceed your expectations.</li>
    <li> Works well. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> THis hair dryer was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I had used my daughter&#x27;s and told her I wanted the&lt;br /&gt;exact same one!&lt;br /&gt;And I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!  After only 4 months of use, this product actually CAUGHT ON FIRE.  Not only a cheap item, but dangerous as well.</li>
    <li> I have course, curly hair. The diffuser works great and the concentrators works well to straighten. Great buy for the $$</li>
    <li> Worked well, and dried hair very efficiently.  The different attachments made it versatile.  The hair dryer died, 4 years and 2 days from the date of my Amazon purchase.  It was used by only 1 member of our household, about 4 days a week on average.  A home with a wife and two daughters might burn this thing out in a year or two.  So, I&#x27;d give it 4 or 5 stars for performance and 2 or 3 star for durability.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my partner to take to the gym since the ones there are pretty weak, sometimes broken or being used by others.  There&#x27;s nothing fancy about this one but it does the job.  The attachment stays on well.  Can&#x27;t attest to the Ionization - makes no sense to me and I can&#x27;t tell any difference between it and many others we&#x27;ve used without this feature.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally do reviews, but I&#x27;ve got a little time on my hands. lol. I received this blow dryer in the beginning of January 2013 and it has worked well for me so far. I haven&#x27;t used the diffuser attachment yet, but I plan to in the future. I am a black woman and have natural hair. I do not blow dry my hair more than once a week. I also did not use the blow dryer when my hair was fully wet, only when damp.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the cool shot button!</li>
    <li> Completely as per description.</li>
    <li> Lasted about one month and died. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend was using this and then out of nowhere it sparked almost burning her face and then it died..recall??</li>
    <li> Works great and fast drying time. The buttons need to be moved. I keep turning the dryer off by accident.</li>
    <li> My last hair dryer broke, after several years of use, so I found myself needing to buy a new new hairdryer. I was planning on purchasing the T2 Featherweight salon quality hair dryer, but at this time really didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money, so I thought I would go ahead with the Revlon one on this page. After all, it is #1 on amazon for hairdryers! After about a week here are my thoughts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very lightweight, cord is a little bit longer then my last one, but not as long as my Chi straightener, definitely dried my hair faster then my last hairdryer too (took maybe 10 minutes, using a rounded brush too), I like the different options, and I use one of the attachments, also the price! really great price for all of these other pros!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none. seems to do a great job, and I am very happy with it. Probably won&#x27;t be spending money on the T2 hairdryer anytime soon!</li>
    <li> Excellent performance, dried my daughter&#x27;s hair in half the time of our older unit. Great performance at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for 1.5 yrs. It&#x27;s very lightweight, has strong blowing power, and the hot gets hot enough to dry my very thick, long hair in less time than any other blow dryer that I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s been a great dryer, until today, when it started sounding like a buzz saw. After reading the reviews describing fires, it&#x27;s time to pull the plug on this thing. It only has a 2 yr, limited warranty - you have to pay to send it in, and include a $6 fee, so it&#x27;s not worth the hassle to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. Uses it every day and says it works great. A+</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this hair dryer.  I have long, thick hair, and it dries it very quickly.  I&#x27;m deducting a point because of the placement of the switches.  I keep turning it off by mistake with my thumb, because they are placed right where I&#x27;m used to placing my thumb.  I think after I get into the habit of holding my thumb in a different position, it will be fine.</li>
    <li> It dries my hair easily and fast.  Leaves hair a soft and smooth feeling.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  Leaves my hair frizzy, which is not normal for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/10/15.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this hair dryer January 15, 2015.  There was a screw in the back handle that got so hot when you used it that it would burn your skin if you touched it.  After never working very well, it quit working all together a few weeks ago.</li>
    <li> I love how light the dryer it.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to however my problem with this item are the power buttons. they are really small and make it hard to turn on/off or go from high to low.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to blow-dry my curly hair any quicker!  The concentrated attachment does nothing for me - my hair gets too frizzy.  But it works to blow-dry my hair fast.</li>
    <li> After less than 2 years of normal use, dryer began to intermittently shut off. It appears that there is a short in the wire at the connect point at the handle.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 6 months</li>
    <li> Works good but my wife has had stronger blowing hair dryers. She says it works okay.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sold on the concept that one hair dryer could dry my hair that much faster than any other without spending beaucoup bucks.  But this one surprised me - because it sure does.  My fine, mid-back length hair is dry in about 2-3 minutes each morning.  Nice!</li>
    <li> I am a guy, this is perfect for everything I want it to do. Girls who come over and use my shower also enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer. It&#x27;s great for the inexpensive price. I initially bought this dryer for the diffuser attachment. I have natural hair and needed to diffuse my hair when I did wash and gos in the winter. The diffuser works great for drying my wash and gos during the cold winter months and I have minimal frizz once I&#x27;m done drying my hair. I also use the concentrator attachment and sometimes I&#x27;ll just use the dryer to blowout my hair straight. This thing does wonders.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after one year. I can&#x27;t fault Revlon. Obviously there must be a frightening amount of engineering and ethical compromises necessary to offer the consumer a $20 hair dryer. And it was a noticeable improvement over my previous dryer, drying my hair faster and saving me lots of time. At this price, I could just order a new one every year. But junk is starting to make me anxious. So instead I&#x27;m going to upgrade to something less disposable--perhaps an $80 model that has to be repurchased every 4 years?&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Also works great for desiccating head lice.</li>
    <li> I have had about five of these thus far. I love them—they are light and efficient and look great. Unfortunately, you should have a back-up at all times, because they will burn out regularly at the most inopportune times. Fortunately, they are relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I chose this dryer based on the many good reviews it received and I am not disappointed. What buyers may need to be aware of with this dryer is that it has a &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting (whereas my old dryer also had a 3rd &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; option.) additionally is has a &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting (whereas my old dryer had low, medium, and high). The dryer is quieter than my previous hair dryer, and more light-weight. I am as far from a professional as a person can get in terms styling hair, so I haven&#x27;t missed the additional settings. I am actually more pleased with the dryer&#x27;s weight since it takes so long to dry my long hair.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight and powerful. Great dryer for the money.</li>
    <li> I am actually buying this to replace my current hair dryer - which is the same one. I was going to buy something new, but according to my order history, I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for 5 years, and it only just stopped working. That&#x27;s some serious longevity on a $20 item. The diffuser is perfect and big and works with my very unruly thick hair better than any diffuser. No reason to spend more money than this.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer worked well...for a while.  Less than a year later, it turns on and off intermittently depending on the position of the power cord. Too late to return but I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Really wish I had read all of the reviews. Way too many people saying the blow dryer is defective. I&#x27;ve had mine less than a year. I don&#x27;t even use it a lot, but today it shot sparks and smoke out of the blue. Scary!</li>
    <li> This hairdryer had all the features I was looking for at a good price.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer a lot. It&#x27;s light-weight, fairly quiet and very powerful. I have long, thick hair, and w/ my old hair dryer it took 10-15 mins to dry my hair. Now I only spent about 2-3 mins and I&#x27;m done! Love it :)</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair often but feels good to know when i do, i have a reluable blow dryer to do so....</li>
    <li> OK let me just say that it works! I am a guy who does projects so I am afraid that what I use this for is drying the dog defrosting the snow blower etc. It gets plenty  hot and puts out vey good pressure</li>
    <li> I neeeded a new hair dryer badly (mine was probably 15 years ole).  This is very nice and quite!  I love the hot/warm air feature and the atttachments.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for 5 years and it still works perfectly. Best hair dryer on the market hands down and the price is unbeatable. Also its great that its super lightweight; I don&#x27;t get tired spending an hour blow drying my hair. Its been with me for five years already and it has traveled a lot but it still works as if I just bought it and it heats up very well. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not in love with this thing and I don&#x27;t hate it. It takes longer to dry my hair, but maybe that&#x27;s a good think, kwim? Love the diffuser tho. It&#x27;s big so you can&#x27;t travel w it, but it&#x27;s a good quality good for curly hair home staple piece. good purchase</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works awesome.</li>
    <li> Lasted exactly 4 months then died.  Not used heavily.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer has 2 heat settings: (1) Too Hot, and (2) a setting I can only describe as Unsuitable For Hair But Handy For Paint Removal. If you want a good thumb workout, you can flash the cold shot button on an off in a vain attempt to prevent this thing from vaporizing the hair right off your head. Mainly my hair ends up hot and still wet, or frizzy from overheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw the packaging away before I realized how awful it is, so I&#x27;m stuck with it. I am incredibly cheap, and yet my intention is to get rid of it and buy a new one next time I&#x27;m at Target. I hesitate to even give this thing to Goodwill, but maybe I&#x27;ll do that instead of throwing it out. I&#x27;ll be sure to attach a note saying &amp;#34;not for use on human hair&amp;#34;, just to preserve my karma.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not too hot when drying your hair and dries it really fast. I hate getting all hot and sweaty in the morning before I even leave for work and this allows me not to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying this product again and will recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Bought this in September, it is now March and the blow dryer cuts off while blow drying my hair. I&#x27;m not pushing any buttons, it just turns off, I wait about 30 sec then it comes back on again. Really disappointed and now I have to research another blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Great Product. I have used many more on the past and none of them like this one. I love how quickly my hair gets dry ( I have very thick and naturally curly hair). Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> So far so good.  This replaced a quiet dryer that last almost 20 yrs.  It is not as quiet as I had hoped but I do like the settings and my hair looks very shiny when I&#x27;m done.  I have fine hair, and I see no problems with this.</li>
    <li> This is my third one of these over the years. I was looking at more expensive, newer dryers and then discovered that this one is still available. It&#x27;s light weight, super fast, and long lasting. My hair is straight, but not thin, and I dry it in about 3 minutes! It has a lower setting and cool shot as well. Really good dryer at a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my blow dryer because I dropped my old one on the ground, breaking the hot and cold switch. I didn&#x27;t really do much researching for a dryer because I needed one so quickly. I do not regret buying this one. This one shoots out really hot air and it takes me half as long to blow dry my hair. Definitely a great product. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheap and i couldn&#x27;t afford much at the time. For a while it was okay but lately it has been sparking inside (like short circuiting or something?). It will spark and get colder, then spark again and get warmer. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal but I&#x27;m terrified that it might start on fire and become a flame thrower. I&#x27;ve stopped using it and moved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect much if you buy it.</li>
    <li> The dryer drys well, is strong enough, and easy to handle. No problems noted. I would certainly buy another again.</li>
    <li> gave this to my daughter for Christmas.  She really likes it, but has used it less than 5 months and the cord shorted out.  We called the manufacturer and they will warranty the product (has a 24 mo warranty).  However the consumer bears the cost of returning the hairdryer to the manufacturer which was nearly 1/2 the price of a new dryer.  They will send a new dryer and the warranty will start again for another 24 months.</li>
    <li> This thing is perfect... Bought it for my SO to use at my place and she was impressed w/ how good it actually is.</li>
    <li> Its pretty weak compared to my last revlon dryer. I will probably donate it and buy a different brand. It also sucks your hair back in and is very painful so be careful if you have long hair. I haven&#x27;t had a dryer this bad since the 90&#x27;s......</li>
    <li> I have read a several great reviews of this product before purchasing. I was nervous as the price was so much lower than oither hair dryers but the product exceed my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer, gets the work done and not too noisy. I have curly hair and works well with it</li>
    <li> I am in love with this dryer. It is lightweight and it drys hair quickly. I have absolutely no complaints! A must buy!</li>
    <li> I chose this item because of its diffuser attachment feature. I have it for two months now, use it 3-4 times/weekly, very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair sorta freezy, but I could manage.</li>
    <li> Replaced a high and hairdryer for my spouse this model seems to work well even better than the more expensive one that she was previously using</li>
    <li> In reading the reviews, I expected it to dry my hair much quicker.  Not the case.  But it does work well.</li>
    <li> love the hair dryer and it reslly cuts the time I spend doing my heair.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this very much</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift - reduces drying time.</li>
    <li> i thought this dryer was supposed to be high powered. from what i read it is supposed to take less amount of time to dry hair. i guess this is true for people with fine to soft curly hair. my hair is thick and curly..i would not suggest this blow dryer for girls with hair like mine or coarser...especially when rushing to work. for the price, cannot complain too much. need something that works better for thicker, curlier hair.</li>
    <li> It is lightweight alright, almost flimsy. Worked infrequently and was so cheaply made, I tossed it as I was afraid of a fire. Just wrote this off as a bad investment...</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and it takes a long, long, time to dry.  I was looking to buy a powerful hair dryer that was reasonably priced.  This is it!  This hair dryer works great.  It dries my hair in no time flat and when you are in a hurry, this is a convenient feature. Plus it&#x27;s lightweight so it&#x27;s nice to take it with you when you travel and because it&#x27;s lightweight it&#x27;s easy on the wrists.  I highly recommend this hair dryer and the price is nice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to a natural, short curly style and needed a diffuser to expedite drying,&lt;br /&gt;while preserving the curl.  This dryer fits the bill and would work with any style as it&lt;br /&gt;comes with accessories</li>
    <li> This hair dryer&#x27;s &amp;#34;wind pressure&amp;#34; for lack of a better term, is very weak. To me, that really defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. The speed and temp settings are great, the attachments work, and the dryer is not so big and cumbersome. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love this. I have been using this since 1.6 years now and its good</li>
    <li> Had for a year and it broke.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a gal who gets all gussied up, but I sure am glad that I bought this hair dryer! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> Not expensive but powerfull and good handling. long hair ladies will love it.</li>
    <li> Its fine. Nothing special.  I don&#x27;t use it daily so its fine for me.</li>
    <li> Great deal and works great!  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Good product with a reasonable price. .</li>
    <li> works like it is supposed to. Love the diffuser. The warm/hot settings help too when trying smooth hair at the end of drying rather than blowing it dry on hot the entire time. Helps too for curls - they dry faster on hot with less movement. I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
    <li> Where can you go wrong with those two benefits.  I have short, fine hair and this works just fine.  My hair takes maybe 3 minutes to style/dry.  No issues with static, or fly-away hair.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer was great and did dry my thick hair quickly - until it quit only 3 months after purchase.  Good basic design, lousy quality.  Only buy it if you want a very short term solution.</li>
    <li> I never realized having a tourmaline ionic ceramic (whatever that means) was such a necessity in life.  But it is! My hair is smoother (almost no straightening iron needed) and silky and looks great. Plus, the dryer is very light weight and quiet.  This dryer is a must!  Update- This dryer was purchased in March of 2015 and it died this morning.  I&#x27;m very disappointed it didn&#x27;t last longer.</li>
    <li> I am not the negative review type person, but this hair dryer died after a couple weeks of using it!! :( Really disappointed, and my return window, of course, has past.</li>
    <li> I really doubt it&#x27;s a new one or a second-hand thing, the plastic is really delicate to be broken and actually it&#x27;s broken already! the bottom of of the dryer, where to input the air, it&#x27;s broken totally and I can&#x27;t believe why I pay money for this!!</li>
    <li> I inadvertently order this product thinking it was a replacement for a different model which I later found was still available. My spouse didn&#x27;t like this simply because it was too big, too powerful and not as portable as her older model (RVDR5001 1875watt) however, my daughter really liked it and she needed one so, after ordering the RVDR5001, they both got what they wanted. Works for me!</li>
    <li> My wife used, you &#x27;ll have to ask her :)</li>
    <li> The big extra head (I dunno what to call it) is useless. it&#x27;s way too big.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for me, returned it.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a year. The cord is nice and flexible, unfortunately it is also not very durable. After one year of gentle use when moving the dryer it shutoff as the wires have broken inside the rubber sheathing. Moving the cord one way it will work, move it the other, it shuts off. Not only is this a hassle, it is dangerous. I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Mine stopped working after 1 1/2 year... The cord was having a short circuit so it&#x27;s on and off every seconds when I use it. Sad...</li>
    <li> When I opened the box and took out the dryer, my first impression of this dryer was that it’s bigger than I expected and the plastic and shape design feels cheap, compared to the last one I had – it’s made by Norelco. It’s smaller, light weight with the plastic finish appeared high quality. It also last more than 20 years, but I couldn’t find that model any more in Amazon or anywhere else in Internet :-(  so I went with this one, as it has lots of good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot get the two attachment to work with this dryer. The dryer does work and can dry my hair, with the warm and hot setting and can also be set to use cool air. The same as my last one. It’s amazing that for 20+ years, the dryer technology has not changed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special to say about this dryer. I hope it lasts as long.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a very good dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I would improve on the placement of buttons as ones hand tends to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;Dries hair quickly.</li>
    <li> Was purchased Dec 16, 2014 and my girlfriend uses it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;The other day she showed it to me and it has melting marks on the cone near the base.&lt;br /&gt;This appears to be a fire hazard in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this 1 star but she said it makes her hair less frizzy but other than that I won&#x27;t buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;The housing should be made better to resist melting like I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;I talked to her today after letting her know I purchased a new hairdryer for her and she informed me that after using the Revlon hairdryer for the last time she wanted to see how soft the melted area was and her comb poked right through the casing,  pics to come.&lt;br /&gt;Revlon should issue a recall on this dryer, it&#x27;s a fire hazard !</li>
    <li> My main gripe with this blow dryer is that the on/off switch is right where your fingers go! So I&#x27;m constantly flicking the dryer off while I&#x27;m trying to dry my hair. It&#x27;d be better if it was a slide switch instead of flip-style switch. Otherwise, the dryer works great and the diffuser attachment is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is my second hair dryer just like this.  The first shorted out after two years of use.  The second, shorted out in 2 months.  I will not be purchasing a third.</li>
    <li> No heat, its just not enough, if ur hair is thin and straight it may work for u but if ur hair is from medium to thick, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve always gone to the store and randomly grabbed a dryer off the shelf.  Decided to use amazon this time to read reviews prior to making a purchase...and so happy I did!  Ended up with a great dryer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this....very light weight, quiet, and maybe its my imagination but I swear my hair is smoother and shinier now (placebo effect?  who knows....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend.  This is a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is perfect for my wavy hair.  When I use the diffuser, it dries my hair fast, and doesn&#x27;t frizz.  It is the perfect hairdryer for me!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer from Amazon at the end of Dec. 2012, used it about once a week, and now after being on for about 30 seconds, the RESET button pops out and the dryer turns off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With over four hundred  5 star reviews, I did not read the lower ratings thinking that it MUST be a great dryer because so many people think so.  Hopefully my \\&quot;5 star\\&quot; review will get you to read the 1 star reviews.  This dryer has had this same problem for years and \\&quot;Revlon\\&quot; has not addressed it.  Maybe because only a small number of dryers end up smoking, sparking, catching on fire they don&#x27;t acknowledge it is a real problem.  This is what Whirlpool has been doing for years and why there is now a class action suit - their Whirlpool, Kenmore, Maytag, and Kitchen Aid dishwashers have resulted in many fires, but they have a video online explaining that since most of the fires are contained inside the machine, they do not feel there is a problem!  Google dishwasher fires before you ever set yours to run while you are sleeping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that this was not a real 5 star review and that it should not have also reviewed dishwashers at the same time, but if only one person avoids a fire with either product I think it is a good review.</li>
    <li> this replaced a very expensive Chi Rocket which I really loved and guess what this is at least just as good and it cost $15 vs $140 that the Chi cost.  Boy am I pleasantly surprised!  I highly recommend this dryer!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for about a year and a half and either it&#x27;s power is really starting to fade or it was always weak and I just never really noticed it. I&#x27;d guess that I dry my hair about 30 times a year; a couple times a week during winter and hardly ever during summer. So, I haven&#x27;t used this much but I have noticed this winter that the hair dryer is awfully weak (I keep thinking the power is on low, but it&#x27;s as high as it can go). I&#x27;d definitely recommend a higher powered hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Works great, and very light weight. Good for traveling.</li>
    <li> love this thing. when it died, i bought another one. great dryer. powerful but lightweight. good purchase! will always use this one!</li>
    <li> perfect for home use. i think that the heat is not that much but really this is perfect for hair drying and for home uses.</li>
    <li> Fine hair dryer. From some of the reviews it seemed like this would be a life-changer, but seriously, it&#x27;s a hair drying. It works very well, quite a bit of power.</li>
    <li> Got this dryer a little over a year ago as a gift. It was fine - better than the old travel dryer I was used to - but it just stopped working one day. I&#x27;d rather pay a little extra to get something that will last longer than just a year.</li>
    <li> We have owned two of these now, they get the job done. The first one lasted two and a half years before the wiring went bad. We noticed on the second one we got that the wiring was a lot thicker. We anticipate it lasting even longer.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as the previous professional blow dryer we bought this to replace. works well, but miss how hard our other one blowed. okay value for the cost i guess.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this lightweight dryer! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars was the diffuser &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; are too short to work for my medium length hair.</li>
    <li> works good,i do not use it often so...</li>
    <li> Has described, light and easy to hold with one hand with no issues. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Purchased for my wife since her old one stopped working....well I am glad I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;First she was skeptical that it would not leave her hair frizzy (big deal guys) but to her surprise it actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;Dry time is very quick ( big deal ladies)</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair dryer I have owned. I cannot believe how much the texture of my hair is improved after using this. I am buying 2 more today to use at my vacation home and RV.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hairdryer for about 15 months. Similar to one of the previous reviews, I was trying to be price conscious but now wish I had made a better choice. I keep pressing the reset button like ten minutes and then it will work for a minute. As soon as it starts, it stops again, making it impossible to actually dry my entire hair. This is depressing because I really liked this dryer and felt I took good care of it. Super disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really powerful! Nice hair dryer!</li>
    <li> This little puppy gets nice and hot. Very pleased!! Comes with a concentrator attachment.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Works great .. Love the attachments.. Great value</li>
    <li> step up from thhe one i had before happy birthday to me</li>
    <li> This dryer is great, dries fast even on the lower speed. The first few times I used it, I kept hitting the off button. Then I realized I was holding the handle too tight - a habit I picked up from my old heavier dryer.  I loosen my grip now the dryer works great, it does not switch off while being used anymore.</li>
    <li> Great dryer.  Perfect for every day needs.</li>
    <li> This is an update for anyone considering buying this hair dryer. I purchased it in 2011 and after about 18 months of use I started to experience problems with the cord at the juncture with the appliance, which caused sparking and smoking as stated in some of the previous reviews. Up until this point the performance had been awesome, and it was by far the best hair dryer that I had ever owned. I contacted Revlon about the issue and they referred me to Helen of Troy, the company that manufactures this particular item for them. Helen of Troy immediately sent me a replacement, and I was thrilled to see that the new appliance has been redesigned and the problem corrected. If you are having any reservations about buying this item due to some of the previous negative reviews, please be assured that the issue has been addressed and the problem resolved.</li>
    <li> It was a great hair dryer but it stop working after 8 months. The thing still looked brand new! Disappointed on how fast it went out.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife as her 15 year old one started tripping the breaker for the bathroom outlet. She loves it and tells me it works very well.</li>
    <li> Pros: dries hair fast, isn&#x27;t too loud&lt;br /&gt;Cons: didn&#x27;t last more than 5 months</li>
    <li> every few years i am looking for a new hair dryer. i have thick, long hair and i hate how long it can to dry. i bought this and i love it. i feel like it has cut my drying time in half.</li>
    <li> Love the blow dryer.It is good for curly or straight hair.</li>
    <li> This product is a safety hazard... Fire hazard. Like many other recen reviews, this hair sparked during use this morning and could have caught on fire. Terrified me. Regular use for about 16 months with no trouble until now. I highly suggest a different hair dryer. Sparks at top of wire/base of hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Really great until it broke 8 months later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality and the weight is perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> It is lightweight and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Drys fast!  Would highly recommend this dryer to anyone and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing blow dryer! Seriously don&#x27;t let the price think your getting something cheap, this works just as good as the expensive ones! It dries my hair incredibly fast and the accessories are a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> great value on a hair dryer.  cord is pretty short</li>
    <li> I have three teenage daughters so recently I purchased three different hair dryers from Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I realized two were essentially identical except for the price, the length of the cord and the \\&quot;brand\\&quot; name. The Pro Beauty Tools 5885 Professional Lightweight Hair Dryer is the exact same as the Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black by Revlon. Both of these hair dryers are made by Helen of Troy. Both have the same handle, body, and heat/speed options. Both have the exact same Intertek number (3175842). The major difference is the Pro Beauty Tools hair dryer does have a cord that is 2&#x27; longer than the Revlon dryer and it (the Pro Beauty Tools) has an extra filter included. For the $10 difference in price (Pro Beauty Tools higher) one can decide if these options are worth the extra cash. In my opinion both of these items are a FIVE STAR item for price and performance.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best hair dryer I have ever used, and I have had super-expensive professional salon dryers, nothing compares to the Revlon Ionic. Dries hair quickly, evenly and leaves hair feeling silky smooth. If you want to give your hair an extra boost of volume, fullness, shine and thickness, try Skingenixx Hair Thickening Shampoo [[ASIN:B00VSC1C6A Skingenixx Professional Strength Hair Regrowth and Thickening Shampoo]], my hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I loved it until the cord connection stopped working within 6 months of purchasing.</li>
    <li> So i&#x27;ve only used this dryer a couple times but so far it&#x27;s lived up to being lightweighhhhht. it&#x27;s also relatively quiet and blow dries my hair in a good amount of time-i don&#x27;t have very thick hair but neither is it thin so this does a good job for the price. as for durability i can&#x27;t tell as yet.</li>
    <li> People reviewed this as being a quiet machine; I don&#x27;t agree. It&#x27;s as loud as the 15-year old metallic dryer I bought this one to replace for my girlfriend. Other than that, she loves it and says her hair dries faster and is much softer!</li>
    <li> Not a good product at all. Short circuit happened which caused a lot of trouble to me. I ended up spending 10 time more than the price of this product. not a good quality product. Amazon customer care didn&#x27;t help much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of buying this product</li>
    <li> It worked great until recently. It seems to have developed a short in the cord after only 1 year. I turned it on and as soon as I lifted it to my head, it shut off. I moved it a different way and it turned on again. Every time I moved it, it went off and on again. I&#x27;ve only had it for a year.  This is the second Revlon dryer (different model though) I&#x27;ve had that died after one year.  Would not recommend unless you don&#x27;t mind buying a new dryer every year.</li>
    <li> Its lightweight and good price little big than I prefer but enough air and lightweight it still deserve five stars.</li>
    <li> Based on reviews on Amazon, I ordered this dryer and it no longer gives any hot air.  I have cleaned the hair catching filter and still no luck.  Very disappointed that it stopped working so quickly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this hair dryer for a year and it just died.  The writing on the buttons wore off with 1 month.  I would not reccommend.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is better than all the stuff I bought before. And don&#x27;t worry about the security problem. It has all been set/</li>
    <li> Quiet, quick, light, high&amp;low, warm&amp;hot, with the cold blast button. I doesn&#x27;t hurt my child&#x27;s ears when I blow dry the hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great little dryer.  &amp;#34;Little&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s a great size but packs a pretty powerful punch.  Dries much faster than the last dryer I had.  Not as many settings and choices but does a great job.  One of the best ones I&#x27;ve had and cuts drying time.  Don&#x27;t know how durable it will be since I&#x27;ve only had it for a month.  If there&#x27;s anything I dislike, it&#x27;s that the attachment is a bit harder to put on than my last one but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
    <li> a little too big for my shelf.</li>
    <li> High Quality&lt;br /&gt;Very Satisfied</li>
    <li> Awesome dryer. I&#x27;ve only used this dryer a couple times and right off could tell I how amazing it is. Less frizzy and easy to use. I&#x27;ve already recommended ir</li>
    <li> Perfect product for a fair price.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer for the price.  Only complaint is that the hottest setting gets the hair dryer too hot sometimes.  So, I just use the warm setting when it gets too hot.  Attachements are easy to attach and remove.  Dryer is lightweight compared to others which is good.  Overall, a good inexpensive dryer.  Like the neutral silver color too.</li>
    <li> a little too large to hold</li>
    <li> She uses it almost every day and she is delighted how well it performs.</li>
    <li> Overall look and feel are fine. Total time that we touch/use it is about ~60 times x 5mins &#x3D; 300 minutes. The power cord just broke last night and almost &amp;#34;got electrocuted&amp;#34;. The cord is extremely BAD. Lesson learned ... don&#x27;t buy anything that the power cord look cheap. Your life is worth more than a couple dollars.&lt;br /&gt;(Low/average usage: Use once a day to dry the kids hair since the weather is getting cold for the past 3 weeks. Otherwise, we don&#x27;t use it that often. it is considered as 1 time per week usage. No stretching on the cord since we are sitting only 2ft from the outlet.)</li>
    <li> So light and effective.</li>
    <li> LOVE MY NEW HAIR DRYER!!! I had this exact one but it was 6yrs old and the &#x27;heat&#x27; died on me.  This one is so much better though!  It works the same, keeps my hair from getting static during these Winter days AND the cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled.  That&#x27;s the one thing I hated with the last one, but this version allows me to wrap the cord around the handle without getting twisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy another one for our guest bathroom for when people visit us!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Revlon Ionic/Tourmaline/Ceramic Model RV544 about a month ago and I am very disappointed. It worked well for a very short amount of time before it started to stall out. I had to hold it very still and at a very specific angle to get it to even blow air which made it very difficult to dry my hair. It finally died with sparks shooting out of the electrical cord at the bottom of the hair dryer. I actually got burned on the leg by one of the sparks and dropped the dyer on the floor and probably could have started a fire if I didn&#x27;t immediatly unplug it. ALL the outlets in my house are surge protected and this still happened. I do not recommend this hairdryer or even any Revlon hair dryers.</li>
    <li> Oh my!  This was AWESOME!  Dried my hair in a fraction of the time but left it feeling smoother than other dryers.  Worth it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful value for the money.  Works well.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome dryer. It&#x27;s very light and quiet - to the point that I&#x27;m not worried about waking up my sleeping infant in the next room when I use it.  It dries my hair quickly and it actually does make my hair seem smoother, similar to a professional blowout.  For the price you cannot get a better dryer.</li>
    <li> Arrived undamaged and works well without over heating.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Love the way it handles, different settings...no complaints.</li>
    <li> Good lightweight hairdryer ....for the price</li>
    <li> A little cumbersome but that would be my only complaint. I actually bought it to dry my puppy so I haven&#x27;t used it a lot. Fine so far!</li>
    <li> Wish it were a bit lighter but other than that this works great.</li>
    <li> It does everything it says it does. I use it to give my hair a little life because it&#x27;s baby fine and doesn&#x27;t have any body. I towel dry it and wrap it for 10 minutes or so before blow drying because my hair is also thick and takes forever to dry if I don &#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine working hair dryer. It does the job: nothing too special about it. It&#x27;s light which is nice. Could be a little more powerful but definitely worth it for the price!</li>
    <li> I love it. It dries up my hair .</li>
    <li> Surprisingly light and decently powerful. I immediately noticed the significant difference in weight between this dryer and my old Conair Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic dryer. AT first I felt it might not be powerful enough, but it is.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to handle and does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase at good price</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace my old hair dryer, which is a travel size. Having used the travel size for 4+ years now, I have almost forgotten how powerful a full-size could be! This Revlon hair dryer gets the drying done in half the time it took me using the travel size. So far so good.</li>
    <li> perfect. just what i was looking for! simple, easy to use and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I have had this dryer for 9 months, and it is still working fine. Decent price for good dryer.</li>
    <li> Same as other reviewers, I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> The dryer works wonder</li>
    <li> I recently got a digiperm and needed to buy a good hair dryer with a diffuser. This one is perfect! It gets hot enough to get the job done, and is super light and well-designed. It&#x27;s the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the low price! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately not fit to Israel</li>
    <li> Excellent buy!  Is light weight and dries my hair fast.  I have short hair and the instruction manual said to &amp;#34;allow the diffuser fingers to run gently over the scalp while drying.&amp;#34;  I tried this while making gentle circular motions - the results were an updated hair style!  Just love it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough - makes my my hair frizzy.</li>
    <li> Great! Works well. Love the attachments.</li>
    <li> I have really thick naturally curly hair and never realized how much the heat in my hair dryer affected the style of my hair. When I blew up my old dryer by trying to use it through a converter in Africa, I bought this one due to the vast amount of positive reviews. It works great, the temperature drys my hair without making it frizzy which I didn&#x27;t have with my last dryer. I love it. Also the defuser works well and gives body to your hair!</li>
    <li> Okay, so when I got this, it was actually one of my favorite blowdryers I have ever used. I have really thick hair, and style it everyday, so this helped add extra volume and shine. After about five months of having it, it started sparking a few times, and finally caught on fire. Hahahaha, I think it might have just been the one I got, and it was defective or something, but other wise it was awesome.</li>
    <li> Light &amp; quiet , dry you hair fast</li>
    <li> Good i used Alot!! my wife is happy to have it, low price and works well</li>
    <li> Thanks alot!! Great product. Fast delivery ):</li>
    <li> Gave this as a  Christmas gift to my sister, she loves it, says it light to hold and dries her really fast.</li>
    <li> love my new blowdryer</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Will not recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the dryer but can&#x27;t get the cold shot button to work</li>
    <li> I used the diffuser and it worked perfectly. Nice power and has hot and warm feature so I don&#x27;t cook my thin hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> IF you have someone with long curly hair in your family, this is a must.  Product has been good so far.  It replaced an older model that got smoked while travelling overseas.</li>
    <li> After using this hair dryer for a few months, it just overheated and stopped working. It was disappointing considering some of the positive reviews I had read on Amazon. You&#x27;re better off with something else or simply picking up a $15-$20 hair dryer at your local drugstore like Walgreens. I did and have been using the same reliable one for several years now.</li>
    <li> I had a hair dryer for almost 14 years, so when it died I wasnt sure what to get - so of course I turned to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have always hated when I had to use a different dryer - generally not enough power.&lt;br /&gt;This one is awesome! I like it better than my old dryer, it takes about 1/2 the time as before to get my hair dry and has good blow power.</li>
    <li> I wanted an inexpensive dryer. works great, had my hair dry in no time at all. Got both the diffuser and volumizer attachments. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this hairdryer. Light weight. Easy to handle and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. For the price it&#x27;s a no brainer!</li>
    <li> It does exactly what&#x27;s written on the box: quick dry time for the perfect blow out. I don&#x27;t have to spend so much time trying to dry my hair anymore (which I hate and I just do because it&#x27;s too cold here) and my hair looks exactly how it would if I went to a salon. Really shine and I can&#x27;t barely see any frizz. Plus, I love it that it not only has a hot and cold shot, but it has a warm one as well. It&#x27;s perfect, because it&#x27;s not too hot that it will damage your hair, but it&#x27;s not cold either so you have to spend way too much time trying to dry it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t use the accessories, but I just can assume they do what they promise as well.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works like a champ.  It gets to a high enough heat and does not give your hair that fried feel or look.</li>
    <li> This dryer is lightweight &amp; dries my hair very fast; I have curly/coily african-american hair &amp; have to use products to make my curls pop, so I wet it almost every morning &amp; this dryer definitely works fast getting my hair dry.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer I have very thick hair and it dries my hair very fast Great product and would buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer on a whim but am really glad I did. The style and performance are pretty average but I like that the two tools were included. The &#x27;high power&#x27; is equivalent to the &#x27;low power&#x27; on my old dryer so that&#x27;s why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars. So far, my hair has not frizzed after using this dryer so I&#x27;ll definitely deal with the low power.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference in sound or drying time. It is lightweight which is much appreciated. Like that it comes with an attachment.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer a little over 3 months ago and the heating element is already broken. It only blows cold air regardless of the heat setting that it is on. I purchased this hair dryer based on the positive reviews that it had received, and I am very disappointed. I will not be purchasing a Revlon hair dryer again. I have an old Conair hair dryer that I have had for almost 10 years that still works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I liked everything except the diffuser attachment.  It made a total mess of my hair.  I like the concentrator, though, and the cool shot feature to cool down the style.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this blow dryer for a few months and the heating element already went out on it.  Only blows cold air no matter what the setting.  What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been having a terrible time with static in my house since the winter months have come, I&#x27;ve been spraying static guard in my hair like crazy and just end up putting my hair up in a pony because I get so sick of it. Since I started using this hairdryer I have had NO problems with static AND it makes my hair so soft. Love it! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Got it for my girlfriend and she loves it, says it&#x27;s cut her dry time in half. Best dryer she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> Received as described, fast shipping good price</li>
    <li> I love this blowdryer! less than half the cost of my last dryer and much better. Very lightweight! A++++  I just bought another one.  My last one burnt out.  I use this 2 times a day almost daily. I think it was the extension cord to be honest.  I tried another one but it was too heavy and didn&#x27;t dry fast enough...actually took 5 times as long to dry my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Love this dryer!</li>
    <li> This dryer felt cheap from the beginning, but I wanted the diffuser attachment...it stopped working and started sparking after 1.5 years after minimal use? Maybe my expectations are too high, but my Vidal Sassoon dryer has worked for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer for when I bathe my King Charles pup.  It is not to loud or hard to use while brushing him at the same time.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before i bought it and they were all true.  This has to be one of the best dryers i&#x27;ve ever owned. Great price, lite weight, the grip feels great. My hair looks great everytime. i don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> This was rated a quiet dryer. That is not the case at all.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer! Nicely priced too.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas. She enjoys it a lot. I guess I made a great pick for her secret santa. If she is pleased, then I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I only gave the dryer 3 stars because it is the second one I have purchased and it simply doesn&#x27;t get as hit in the lower heat as the first one I had.</li>
    <li> Comfortable in hand. Quite and powerful. The price is good. The design is good. My wife is happy with it.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this hair dryer, it&#x60;s light weight. It has hot, warm and cold switch. she only use the warm level. Her hair looks great.</li>
    <li> Nice blow dryer while it lasted.  I&#x27;ve had it less than 2 years and the fan bearing are going out.  Sounds horrible.  I&#x27;m disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last longer.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for the cost. Works like a charm. Great Packaging. I would definitely recommend this product. . . .</li>
    <li> Revlon dryer is everything I was looking for, this dryer is inexpensive works great and it&#x27;s lightweight. Dries very fast.</li>
    <li> Love it, the only problem I have is that I am natural, and I thought that this came with the comb attachment. However, these attachments are really cheap at the local beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> NOPE. NOPE AND NOPE.   This thing sparks out onto your hair, it&#x27;s a flippin fire hazard, can you imagine you had just sprayed hair spray and was finishing it off with a quick run through!?! No way! This was working great until I noticed sparks flying out from inside the dryer while I was drying my hair. WTF.  Wow. Just wow. Usually it takes me about 10 minutes to dry my hair but this thing did it in 3, and not only did it dey it, it made it manageable and shiny with the nozzle attachment. Never going back, thanks Amazon community for this great find!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good dryer but doesn&#x27;t last more than a year. I&#x27;ve replaced it twice now a year apart. It just stops. I like how light weight it is. The description says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;super quiet&amp;#34;: it&#x27;s just as loud as any other 1875 watt hair dryer, I don&#x27;t know who they are kidding.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer ONLY blows cold air. As a product that has one simple and singular function this is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> I had bought an expensive tourmaline professional dryer that cost $150 +, and then read the reviews on this dryer and returned the other.  Unless you are a hairdresser, and have your dryer on all day, you don&#x27;t need the professional type.  This works just as well for a mere fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in November 2014 and have been using it since then.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best hair dryer I have ever used. It is light weight, the air flow is perfect and also dries my thick curly hair very soon.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this for sure.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my night job</li>
    <li> Light weight. Good power and heat. Only two settings for each but don&#x27;t really need more. Nice attachments.</li>
    <li> Great Dryer light but strong. Works great.</li>
    <li> Met all of our expectations</li>
    <li> It works very well for me. Been using for almost a year now. As for the exploding units, that&#x27;s pretty scary. Remember to use this with care .</li>
    <li> Love it!! I mostly use the diffuser and never to straighten my hair but the extensions are perfect and they get the job done an doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with that burned smell. Everything I was looking for and cheap too.</li>
    <li> Only worked for 5 months and now  I can no longer return!</li>
    <li> BEST HAIR DRYER EVER!!! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this... my hair has never felt so smooth and looked so shiny. Thank you Amazon for another great beauty tool</li>
    <li> This is an awesome dryer!! It&#x27;s so light weight, which makes it so easy to use. Also dries my hair very quickly!! Way faster and lighter than my old dryer.</li>
    <li> Love the dryer.  It comes with a diffuser, which is easy to use, if you like that drying method.  The dryer isn&#x27;t too heavy, and gets my very heavy hair dry.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this dryer for a while now, and just as I was drying my hair a few minutes ago, it flickered and flames shot out of the cord hole. Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t get burned, but I could smell burnt air. Had to take it outside so as not to catch the place on fire. Given similar stories of the hair dryer catching fire, I&#x27;d stay away from this one. I&#x27;m surprised Revlon is still selling the Ionic Tourmaline Ceramic dryer given the proof that it is dangerous while using. At best they should issue a recall and take a look into the mechanics of their product so that no one else gets hurt or potentially killed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about a year.  I use it to dry my hair at least once a day.  It&#x27;s a great, powerful dryer.  Excellent value.  HOWEVER, the cord has become very, very... very twisted after a year of use.  To the point where the cord makes itself so short that if you&#x27;re trying to move the dryer around (to.. dry your hair), it will become unplugged because the twisted cord is no longer long enough.  I hope this makes sense.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy again because of the cord issue.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to hopefully quiet down her morning routine.  I find it slightly less high pitched than her old one, and barely quieter</li>
    <li> this hair dryer does what it&#x27;s suppose to do,no more friz.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, energy efficient because it dries my hair really fast and it;s very lightweight. Looks sturdy. Had it for almost a year and haven&#x27;t gotten any problem yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I agree with some of the other reviews - this IS the lightest hairdryer I&#x27;ve owned (and I&#x27;ve had many).  The cord is super long (or in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t need to be any longer).  Maybe to those who have had it &amp;#34;burn out&amp;#34; after a few months didn&#x27;t realized you have to remove the filter cap on the back to clear the lint from it.  It&#x27;s also as quiet as the product says it is -- at least on the low setting.  Of course turning it on high will make it louder. Although it didn&#x27;t necessarily dry my hair any faster, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to.  It did give my hair a nice shiny, no-frizz look.  Overall, great dryer, would recommend to anyone.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> After a couple years of infrequent use, it caught on fire this morning (an electrical fire shooting small flames from the base of the hairdryer where the cord connects). Fortunately it didn&#x27;t cause major damage beyond some burned clothing. A quick search through the Amazon reviews suggests that other people have had the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend that you DO NOT purchase this hairdryer. If you do, keep a Class C fire extinguisher in your bathroom (in fact, that&#x27;s probably a good idea either way).</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It seems to dry my hair faster than other hair dryers. It is easy, compact. I&#x27;d recommend it, especially for the value.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife since the previous one reached enf-of-life. Not expensive and works as well.</li>
    <li> Bought this hair dryer cause my other one blew out while I was doing a full blowout for the clubs.  Got this one cause it was cheap and I wanted to save money cause with the money I saved, I can buy some drinks for the ladies.  Used it and it&#x27;s pretty good.  Very quite and works like a hair dryer should.  One hand use is excellent.  Dryer in one hand, fist pump to house music with the other hand.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.  Materials is plastic and seems to be made to my satifation.  If dropped though, it would probably break on impact. Would recommend to others and to my lady friends who spends the night.</li>
    <li> Broke yesterday! And it burnt my husband&#x27;s hand!</li>
    <li> works fast! gets really hot lol!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair and had no idea a blow dryer could make such a difference!  It&#x27;s super lightweight and dries my hair in a fraction of the time, which I appreciate since arthritis in my hands made blow drying difficult and unpleasant with my old dryer.  But the biggest plus, and I never expected this, is that it makes my hair much smoother and less frizzy.  I was very surprised and happy with the results.  I am not good at &amp;#34;girl stuff&amp;#34; but was able to make my hair look smooth and soft and straight in just minutes with a round brush and this dryer. I was hesitant at first because the price is low, but it really does the job of a more expensive product.  I am buying another one so when this one finally bites the dust I have another.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s really easy on my hair and I can switch the heat from warm to hot very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this dryer very highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this dryer is lightweight and easy for me to handle.</li>
    <li> After reading the other one star reviews, I guess I&#x27;m lucky this thing didn&#x27;t blow up in my face or melt anything, plus I got a whole 14 months of use out of it before it died--just sort of acted like it got really tired and shut off--so, winning...?  Seriously, don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s garbage.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this blow dryer!  It dries my hair so fast but without damaging it.  I highly recommend this one and hope it lasts a long time.</li>
