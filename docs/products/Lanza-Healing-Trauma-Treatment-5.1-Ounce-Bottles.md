<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was recommended this product by my dermatologist. It works great and leaves my hair soft.  I was experiencing some thinning hair in my crown area and this product has helped. I&#x27;ve only used it for 4 weeks. Love the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews about Trauma Treatment and wanted to share that I use this product as a treatment on dry hair, sleep with it and wash it out the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fine curly hair seems to have decent body when it&#x27;s first colored at a salon but as weeks go by, even if I touch up my own roots with&lt;br /&gt;products made for consumers to use at home, the texture of my hair starts to become horrible.  I&#x27;ve used many products to hopefully restore the texture and shine but either they weigh my hair down pitifully to where my curls fall flat or else I wind up with volume but&lt;br /&gt;also lots of frizz and poorly defined curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution is this...Every other night, on dry hair, I squeeze about a T of Trauma Treatment into my hands and rub it through my dry hair...I can instantly see and feel that my hair is full of moisture....I use enough to where my hair feels wet...(but don&#x27;t worry, this will&lt;br /&gt;dry within 30 minutes) I lightly brush the TT through my hair, put my hair in a ponytail on top of my head and sleep with the Trauma Treatment.  In the morning, I rinse my hair and use less shampoo than normal plus just a small amount of conditioner and find without actually using more Trauma Treatment, my hair has been restored.  Of course, this becomes an expensive proposition...and this is temporary but as time goes by, I see that I can skip 3-4 days and still hold onto the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best solution I&#x27;ve ever found to get my hair to actually absorb the nutrients from a conditioning product.  I&#x27;ve tried this procedure with other deep conditioning products and never achieved the same results.  So, I&#x27;m really hooked!</li>
    <li> Love this product, my hair feels great!</li>
    <li> It is a great product, but just remember a little goes a long way. I have hair past my shoulders and only use a dime size amount. It&#x27;s made my hair super soft and the shine is unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I have fine curly hair and have tried every product to enhance my curls without making them crunchy, frizzy, or flat.  I now just wash my hair and use a dab of the Lanza Healing Trauma Treatment, and my curls look wonderful!  My hair feels wonderful too. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I literally just got my first bottle of Lanza Healing Color Care Trauma Treatment. After reading all of the reviews, I thought I would give this product a try too. My first impression was it&#x27;s a small bottle for what you pay - hopefully it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark thick hair, fairly long, insanely dry and out of control. I color it myself and style with a flat iron regularly. What I want is healthy, moisturized hair. As I&#x27;m growing my hair longer, hopefully the length will make my natural wave not too crazy looking and I can avoid heat altogether. I&#x27;m hoping this product will get me there.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the smell is fantastic. It really does have a great salon quality scent, compared to an artificial Herbal Essence or something. I colored my hair  the other day so I was anxious to get this treatment in my hair right away. It says to use on towel dried hair, but I went ahead and put it on my dry hair. I needed about a quarter size amount to accommodate the amount of hair I have. It is somewhat sticky. I had to wash my hands after to get the residue feel off. Currently my hair does not feel any different. I don&#x27;t know if my hair sucked up the nutrients or if this conditioner really didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;So on that note, next time I wash my hair I will do as the instructions say and see what happens. I&#x27;ll add updates as I go. I&#x27;m really desperate for an effective product, let&#x27;s see if this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 04/23/12 *****  I washed my hair and then applied this on my towel dried hair, letting it air dry as I normally do. I still haven&#x27;t had a great result. Nothing spectacular so far. At this point I would not recommend this hair treatment. I&#x27;ll keep on trying it, I&#x27;m not about to write it off completely yet. It at least smells good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 04/30/12 ***** This is definitely not a Trauma treatment. It&#x27;s only a leave-in conditioner that has the same effect as any other drug store leave-in I&#x27;ve used. My hair has not seen a change from the first time I&#x27;ve used it. I really wished I had a great experience like the other reviewers. I&#x27;m more than ready to have healthy hair once again and I&#x27;m sad I forked out $20+ for this.st time I&#x27;ve used it.

    <li> After 3 weeks of using this, I am very impressed.  Let me start out by giving you my hair type - baby fine but LOTS of it and it is curly.  I hilight and lowlight it and usually straighten it with the blow dryer.  Needless to say, it has a tendency to dry out if I do not take really good care of it.  This conditioner is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried, but I say that with a few precautions.  First of all, if you have fine hair, use VERY LITTLE and do not put any above your ears or it is bound to look greasy.  This is heavy stuff and you don&#x27;t need much (if straightening like I do, TIGI S-factor makes a great straightener that works well for my hair type and can be used in conjunction with this).  If you have thick, curly hair, I would imagine you can use it all over on a daily basis.  When I wear my hair curly, I use it to the roots and it works great - gives my limp curls enough moisture to be more defined.  I also use this sometimes as an overnight leave-in (heavy application) with the intent to wash it out in the morning.  I&#x27;ve been using this sparingly for several weeks and my dry hair is now soft.  I ordered the liter size and will try it as an in-the-shower-rinse-out conditioner when I get it.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, definitely give it a try!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I wish I&#x27;d discovered this years ago.</li>
    <li> If you have dry, damaged hair, this product will give you instant glossy locks and it will feel so much smoother and tangle-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> love love love. i have curly, thick, unruly hair and its ALWAYS dry. i use salon shampoos and conditioners and still, always dry. i use this every time i wash my hair and when i straighten it, it feels like silk. cant quite pinpoint the smell but i love it. would recommend this to anyone with hair that just cant keep moisture. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have noticed no difference from using this product, and I purchased it on the recommendation of someone who dyed their hair, and then used the product and swore it was life changing. I recently dyed my hair, so I purchased this hair product and it does nothing different for my hair. I wish I could return it, not because it did anything bad, but because it hasn&#x27;t done anything at all for my hair. I may be the only one though. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> this product really works for me. I can count on it to make my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;My stylist attempted to turn me on to something similar, but there really was no comparison.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other stuff but keep coming back to this.  It controls the static and flyways without weighing it down and I like the smell</li>
    <li> I have incredibly damaged hair from perming and highlighting it.  This product softens it without weighing it down or making it look greasy (only use about a dime-sized amount, though).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, naturally curly hair... Can&#x27;t function without it.  Much better price then salons, larger quantity so I only buy once a year, added it to the holiday order to save on shipping.  Works great and my hair feels 20 years younger.</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves my hair so soft! No knots :)</li>
    <li> I first got this product from my hair stylist. It is a fantastic leave in conditioner to use in addition to conditioning in the shower. Never leaves my hair greasy or weighted down. Like other reviewers I have naturally wavey hair and all I do is brush it in wet and let my hair air dry</li>
    <li> Takes your hair to a whole new level! I cannot live without this. I use it as a leave in and occasionally as a deep treatment. Doesn&#x27;t weight hair down and soothes my frizzy hair into a nice sleek look. Holy grail of leave ins!</li>
    <li> I bought this product locally, based on Amazon reviews, so I thought I would share my experience. Maybe because I had such high expectations, I have been disappointed. Basically, I have found this to be an average leave-in conditioner, not anything that heals trauma or over-processing. It leaves my hair a little softer and a bit stickier than it is without a leave-in conditioner, but it has the added, unexpected, bonus of giving my hair a little extra body. When I use this, I forgo a styling cream.</li>
    <li> Great product!  It makes my hair very smooth and soft.  Also, it is great for detangling.</li>
    <li> My hair was as course as hay after all the color and abuse I had done to it.  This was recommended to me, and I LOVE it!  I started seeing results almost right away, and since using it daily, my hair is the best texture it&#x27;s ever been.  It&#x27;s soft and smooth.  I still have no body in my hair, lol, but at least it feels nice.</li>
    <li> Lanza products are seriously a miracle for me. They are all amazing. Especially this product</li>
    <li> This is a miraculous product ~ recommended by my hair stylist, I have been using it for 2 yrs and love the way it works. For best results, I apply it after a shower at the gym, wrap in towel and do whirlpool and then steam -- 20 mins later rinse -- an excellent treatment -- voila!</li>
    <li> First found out about this product last summer. I ran out of my first bottle and went for a month without it. THAT will never happen again. Enough said?</li>
    <li> This product is so-so.  I was expecting more of a miracle for my hair.  But, it was just very subtle.  That was my experience, anyway.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser, trained in the Lanza line, hounded me to buy this product for weeks because she really thought it would help my severely damaged from years of being bleached, fried and otherwise tortured hair...eh. It&#x27;s okay. I think it works just about as well as any other higher-end leave damage treatment. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell and definitely have other products I prefer over this one. I would probably not buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it regularly, usually running it through towel-dried hair with a wide tooth comb and putting it up in a bun before bed, really focusing on the damaged ends and allowing them to soak up as much product as possible.The first time I used it, I used waaaay too much, leaving my hair feeling GROSS in the morning. I would suggest starting small and working up to what feels best for your hair.</li>
    <li> Best leave in hair conditioner....ever!</li>
    <li> I use this every time I wash my hair as a leave in conditioner for my curly hair.  I love it.  Since I began using this product my hair is much healthier!  Price here is less than half of salon price.</li>
    <li> But hair is loving this new product</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this for me but sells it for twice as much, so I came here to get more :)  I have curly colored hair and leave it in after rinsing or washing daily.  Can&#x27;t beat it!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Leave in at night and your hair will look and feel restored in the morning.  Really great to use in the summer when your hair takes a beating from the sun and chlorine.</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair from a box dyed dark brown to white blonde and then dyed pink and later bleached the pink out. I did it all at home and was never careful enough when I touched up my roots so I rebleached my hair often. Of course, this turned my fine curly hair into a limp mess. I tired this leave in conditioner and was amazed! My hair curled again for the first time in months and actually felt soft and smooth! This stuff saved my hair and prevented it from dissolving.&lt;br /&gt;One caveat, if your hair is healthy this product may not work well for you. My sister used it one her healthy thick curls and said it made them feel coarse and dry. I kept using this product daily as my hair grew out and became more healthy. At a certain point my hair was healthy again and this product made my hair feel sticky instead of soft, so I switched to something. I kept the bottle for next time I color my hair ;)</li>
    <li> Love this leave-in on my dry, chemically treated and naturally coarse hair. I have frizz issues often and the constant blow drying and straightening doesn&#x27;t help. This product is heavy enough that it keeps my hair in check while not making it feel weighed down or greasy - even after a few days. I am not sure how it would play on finer hair, but for those of us with coarse hair that has a mind of its own, this is sure to heal your hair&#x27;s trauma!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve found that actually improves my hair rather than just covering up the problems of dryness, damage, and frizz. It leaves my hair actually soft, something I&#x27;ve been trying to recover for about four years now! I put it on damp hair after washing (and conditioning) and dry hair in between shampoos. It&#x27;s light, not heavy, and I see immediate improvement. I really love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I had bought this product about a year ago and found it wonderful for my type of hair, but all of a sudden I could not find it in any store where I live.  In the meantime I tried other products, some of them good and others not as good  so I decided to try Amazon.  It gives volume to my short hair, but leaves no greasy residue.  I sure like this product, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I am over 45 with a substantial amount of gray. My hair is also dry and I live in a dry climate. I color (myself), blow dry and flat iron which doesn&#x27;t help. My hair used to be straight (it&#x27;s longer than shoulders), now with the gray, it&#x27;s coarse and wavy and quite unruly. Recently, I had been trying everything at the beauty supply from sulfate free shampoos to hair masks to olive oil and keratin treatments and NOTHING has helped. My hair was so dry, I could not even get a heavy conditioning treatment through it with my fingers, I had to comb it through, breaking a lot of hair in the process. I tried many leave-in conditioners, but they made my hair feel heavy and sticky. Finally, I went to a local hair dresser and she recommended this product. In fact, she was so confident that she told me to take it and try it (without paying) and if it didn&#x27;t help to return it. Immediately when I used it, it made my hair feel silky without being heavy. It smells great too. Now after 3 or 4 times using it, when I wash my hair, it feels totally different. It has considerably more moisture and I can actually get shampoo and conditioner through it with my fingers and without all the breakage. Before LTT, I had little broken hairs all along my part line, LTT has completely stopped the breakage along the part.  It also keeps your color from fading and since I&#x27;m a red head (and red color fades very fast), this is a PLUS! Trust me, from someone who has tried almost everything on the shelf at Sally&#x27;s, this is the ONLY thing that has worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I barely have to use a flat iron at all now.  My hair is so silky and manageable after I blow it straight with a round brush that I barely need a flat iron at all!</li>
    <li> Miracle in a bottle I use this after every wash day and relaxer. My hair is also color treated. It keeps my hair soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> Only a little is needed.  Works wonders on ends and over processed hair to give more hydration and protection.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I tried this on my daughter&#x27;s hair at the recommendation of her stylist.  After many many tears (both hers and mine) I could not keep my four year old&#x27;s hair mat and rat free.  I was just about ready to get her long locks cut short when this product was recommended to me.  (My stylist does not sell this product, by the way).  Oh my, what a difference.  Any tangles that are present when we wash her hair \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; as if by magic when I comb it through and her hair is shiny and silky and we both can smile again! This stuff is like liquid gold!</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product really hydrates your hair without leaving it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair looks shiny and healthy and also protects it from blow dryer and the elements.&lt;br /&gt;I combine this with a straightener when I blow dry and the results are great.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for several years.</li>
    <li> I use a small amount of this before I blowdry my hair and it really protects my really processed blonde hair from the heat of my ionic blowdryer.</li>
    <li> The only downside to this product it is that it has parabens. If it weren&#x27;t for that, I&#x27;d give it five stars. It works REALLY well, though, so if you have damaged hair... slap some on and go sit in the sun and do your nails!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Lanza Healing Trauma Treatment for a couple years, but felt it was overpriced at my local store.  I decided to look for it online and found the product I was looking for here at about half the price.  AND it was delivered to my home in a very timely manner.  Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Lanza Healing Trauma Treatment helps calm down my hair.  It makes the curls pretty instead of frizzy.  My hairdresser introduced me to it, because she keeps it at her station in the salon for hair like mine.  I have very fine hair but a lot of it, with a lot of bounce to it.  I don&#x27;t want to be without this product again!</li>
    <li> I had seen Lanza products at my hair salon, but they were too expensive.  So I came to my Amazon and found the same leave-in conditioner for a fraction of what the salon charged.  I apply just a dime-size amount and work it through my hair with my fingers and a comb.  My hair damage is from blow drying and flat ironing...this product is repairing the frizz with each use and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  Will continue to use it and recommend it to others who suffer from damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 6,7 times now, it works pretty well. It detangles my hair nicely and smells pretty good...not a miracle-worker, but it does seem to protect my hair from the flat iron a bit, and it does make my hair soft. Doesn&#x27;t help very much with my frizz.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner leaves my hair managable, soft, and shiney.  I have gone through several bottles and cannot get the same effect with any other product.</li>
    <li> my review is not about the product as I have used it before and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I have since moved to another state and could not find this product at any of the salons in my town. The nearest one was 30 plus miles away. so I tried to order it online, I am very dissatisfied with the length of shipping. I ordered it eight days ago. I was supposed to receive my product today in the mail. It is not here. I checked the tracking on it and it is still in California.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the original date to receive it has changed to the 28th of April. that is almost a month after I ordered the product. I won&#x27;t order from this seller again. I would rather drive the 30 miles and spend the gas money.</li>
    <li> Love the product and shipping was as stated.good product, good service.</li>
    <li> I had tried a two bottles of the Lanza Healing oil when I decided to give this product a try because I color my hair and was going thru a lot of conditioning products to keep the knots at the base of my neck at bay. This product has done that and has given my hair body that I was&lt;br /&gt;only prior able to obtain thru deep conditioning. This product has replaced my styling mouse, my deep conditioner treatment and I am using&lt;br /&gt;this Lanza product instead of the the Lanza Healing oil, which is a great product too, this one has just been better overall in the benefits for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have just ordered a second larger size bottle and I am very pleased with the way my hair looks and smells.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for my somewhat over-processed hair.  Makes it feel smooth and look shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Helps my color and styling of my fine hair last longer. It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have short purple hair. I change my hair color more often then I care to admit and this product has definitely helped in keeping my hair fairly healthy. I would suggest this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Ever since starting on this stuff, I can&#x27;t stop. Just a dab helps heal and protect my hair and keep it from flying away. I have very thin hair.  My only problem is when I inadvertently use too much. A little goes a long way. Even my hairdresser noticed my hair looking and feeling better.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT conditioner.  My hair broke off a couple of years ago, and it has helped to repair it tremendously.</li>
    <li> The smell is kinda weird, it&#x27;s not bad… it&#x27;s just weird. It&#x27;s in between fruity and tangy.&lt;br /&gt;The treatment is great for your hair though!</li>
    <li> This treatment helps hair from drying out from a lot of hair dryer/curling iron and flat iron usage without weighing it down or making it feel greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this L&#x27;Anza conditioner. The shampoo is excellent as well! Both leave my soft, smooth and very manageable! I keep re-ordering it!</li>
    <li> This is awesome!  It seems to have saved my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it since my stylist recommended it to me and after 3 months of use I can say that it has made a big, huge difference in my hair.  I have slightly curly hair that frizzes easily--color treated since I&#x27;m 15 years old.  This stuff made my hair much less frizzy, soft to touch, easier to style, curls instead of frizzes out. Amazing.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I also dye my hair so it&#x27;s hard to find a product that works. I love this leave in conditioner!</li>
    <li> Not heavy or greasy at all.  Has softened my hair and strengthened it quite a bit.  Great product.  Will by more.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, really made my hair feel great and less frizzy.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped as expected.</li>
    <li> Have tried every treatment for dry damaged hair; this and all Lanza products are consistently among the best.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Tends to be a little greasy if used all over my head. I have oily hair so I only use it on the ends.</li>
    <li> Yeah, this stuff stinks, and isn&#x27;t at all what I thought I was buying, will not be purchasing ever agian.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it as a leave-in conditioner after every shower and it really makes a difference on the ends of my hair especially.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described. Great!</li>
    <li> This product is also great!  There is less hair in the sink and on the floor after only two uses!  I recommended this product to my friends who also have breakage.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lasts a really long time!</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use on your hair pre blow drying. It smooths out the hair and makes it easier to blow out.</li>
    <li> thanks! love this product it works great.  great for your hair. great treatment or for an overnight treatment. love it</li>
    <li> This has been the best conditioner, consistently for the last 5 years at least. It fights dryness as well as frizziness and it does not weigh your hair down. I wondered about the before I started using it, but I just add it to somewhat-toweled off hair, dry it and I can&#x27;t tell that there&#x27;s anything there. It also doesn&#x27;t make hair color fade or turn brassy, as I have discovered that some of the argan oil formulations can. I have wavy hair that picks up any humidity in the air, so I can&#x27;t speak for people who might have curly hair or stick-straight hair but this is the best leave-in product I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and love it.  It keeps my hair looking healthy and the color lasts longer.</li>
    <li> I first bought this product at  a beauty salon.  I loved the results. I did not love the price but bought it anyway.ithe results was worth it. The salon ran out so I decided to try and purchase it on Amazon. It is not sold in any local stores,.&amp;#34;Salons Only&amp;#34; Surprise! AAmazon had it and for only $10.00LESS than the salon.  Great Product! Great Price!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on me the last time I was in.  This hair made my hair feel nice and manageable.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be heavy and it left my hair in very good shape.  Although I am usually a Redken fan, this product does a nice and intensive job.  I will alternate this with the Redken product and see how it works for me.  It does leave my hair feeling soft and managable and I have processed hair so anything that can make my hair feel better is a great thing for me.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive but the end result is great.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product it is absolutely fabulous for  dry ends.This is definitely a miracle in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected and $6 less than my local salon.</li>
    <li> This is a good brand product although a bit pricey.  I have curly hair and it conditions and softens the hair.  I still need to use a styling product such as a curl enhancer after this for control.</li>
    <li> I like this product..</li>
    <li> Suddenly had dry hair that nothing would work on: masks, oils, deep conditioners... After 3x putting it in and leaving it on, it looks like it did a year ago. My thin, fine hair looks healthy again.</li>
    <li> No words to describe how great this product has worked on my hair.</li>
    <li> The product came as scheduled however it hasn&#x27;t done much for my hair, in fact it left my hair kind of sticky even when using the littlest bit. I have fine strands of hair but plenty of it.  Maybe this should be used by someone with slightly courser hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know this product works for your hair then definitely buy it here.  The price was right and the shipping was really fast!</li>
    <li> Fantastic Product. Leaves hair in such good condition.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair after coloring.  It made my hair very managable and soft.  I bought this from AMazon and use it as a deep conditioner when needed.  I am happy with it.  I will admit that I do switch up between this and Redken&#x27;s All Soft deep conditioner. This is  a conditioner to keep in your arsenal.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my stylist recommended it.  I put a LITTLE bit (between pea and dime size) on my hair while it&#x27;s still wet, prior to using any other styling products, and my hair&#x27;s never been softer.  Since you use so little, one bottle should last a long time.  It&#x27;s a very good protectant for blow drying and flat-ironing.</li>
    <li> 😍Need this every other shampoo.  Made a difference for my spiral, dry, processed hair.  May need it every time depending on the weather.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Keeps my hair smooth!  Happy with packaging and delivery!</li>
    <li> it was  a waste of money</li>
    <li> Love the product. Won&#x27;t use anything else for my hair. Will purchase again. Shipping was fast and easy. Recommending this product to friends.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this leave in. I color my hair and often use a flat iron so my hair is dry. I had hoped this product would repair some of the damage but it did not.  It actually made it worse.</li>
    <li> Great product will keep buying it makes your hair beautiful !</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my order. I received it very quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I ride a motorcycle, between the wind damage and coloring it, my hair needed some healing. I noticed a difference immediately. I put some in and leave it overnight, or during my workouts, 2x a week. A little goes a long way. My hair feels softer, and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> Great for treated hair and hair subject to chlorine in pool.  Love the product and the scent is great !</li>
    <li> You just need to use a drop (like pea size) after you wash your hair. Don&#x27;t rinse out!  A pea size goes a long way.  Makes hair very soft and silky looking - great for damaged hair or over colored hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after dying my hair(again). I both relax and dye so my hair is dry and breaks of at the end. This product in just one wash stopped a lot of the breaking and with my normal hair cream my hair stays soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair as soft as silk and so very healthy! I use it once a week on my color-treated hair. I&#x27;ve bought this for my friends also and they love it too!</li>
    <li> I am glad I found a conditioner that I can leave in.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My stylist used it when she did my color recently and I knew I needed to use it at home.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing.  However, I bought more of it, because my Stylist swore it would help my dry, frizzy, wild hair.  My hair is losing its shine now that I am older, in menopause and diabetic.  I also recently went through 4 surgeries...and anesthetic isn&#x27;t good for you hair.  Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. Hair feels smooth and healthy.  Received it early and didn&#x27;t pay high prices for shipping. Even if I had to pay it would be worth it.  The stores charge $30 for this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for color treated hair.  I use the hair dryer to style my hair and it&#x27;s a great guard against the heat too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really in love with this product!  It&#x27;s great, it really revitalizes and brings back softness into my often dry and damaged color treated hair. I use it every time I wash my hair as a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have frizzy, curly hair.  Helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product works as well as the reviews say it does. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right, but I was hoping it would work better than other products I&#x27;ve used in the past (I have coarse, thick, wavy, and somewhat frizzy hair). I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and it smells great!  It is great for anyone that needs extra conditioning especially in the summer.</li>
    <li> this leaves my hair soft, but acts like a gel curling it and keeping it curled.  just apply , fluff and go, love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It helps to keep my hair from breaking and helps to repair it I need that.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I highlight my hair and blow dry often. I have been using this product for years and it is great at protecting from heat and coloring. It is not greasy at all which I like. It is almost like a lotion for hair. Initially I had purchased it because I had a highlight job that went wrong and it brought the life back to my hair. I put it on before I blow dry along with a light serum to control frizz. Everybody says how healthy my hair looks.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best leave in conditioner I have used.  I used it when my hair was straight and now with a perm.  I get excellent results.  It also smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have permed and highlighted hair which is fine to begin with. This product keeps my hair looking great and healthy (ish). I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year, as long as I&#x27;ve been abusing my hair with all the chemicals. Just purchased my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning after I shower (I use L&#x27;anza moisturizing shampoo and conditioner) instead of a styling creme. I spread a pea-size amount into my palms, distribute it in combed hair, scrunch it a tad, and just leave it in; I do not blow dry my hair as it just dries it up. The product makes my curls looking quite natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone who has curls, natural or &amp;#34;man-made.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Have to keep this in stock! I use it before styling, and it leaves my hair protected and smooth! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years. Does not leave hair greasy, love what it does to my hair, nourishes and hydrates</li>
    <li> From my wife: \\&quot;This stuff is amazing! I have extremely dry and thick hair, especially if I blow dry it. I have had a very hard time finding something that works well on my hair type. I use a very generous portion of this on my hair right before blow drying and it does wonders. It leaves my hair smoother. I just wish it came in a bigger bottle and was cheaper, because I go through it fast.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The smell is divine and your hair feels like silk without weighing it down. Use it in the shower like regular conditioner and /or leave it in .</li>
    <li> So I had a bad dye job where the chemicals literally caused my bangs to break off, and all of my hair - roots to ends - was super dry and brittle.  I have been using this stuff per a recommendation from a different hair dresser and I LOVE IT.  It works so well AND it smells amazing.  Obviously parts of my hair could not be fixed (the bangs) and I have to wait for them to grow out, but this helps the hair that could still be saved and makes the other areas more manageable.  Recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this product - keeps my hair soft</li>
    <li> Love it, but it s not for daily use, once a week good enough</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I use this along with the L&#x27;anza Volumnizer Thickening Shampoo (Unisex), as well as the leave in conditioner and the conditioning oil.  All these products have made a HUGE difference in my hair. I use all kinds of products and was using WEN up until I found out about L&#x27;anza.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review after having just used this product for the first time. I colored my hair with the top half red and the bottom half blonde (bleached) a few months ago and I had no idea how to take care of bleached hair. the bottom portion became incredibly damaged and after speaking to my hairdresser today she recommended this product. I used if after shampooing and did not rinse it out as instructed. I was concerned my hair would be tacky from leaving the conditioner in, but my bleached hair soaked it right up and air dryed normally. After one application all I can say is WOW! No tangles, my hair feels softer and healthier. If you have damaged hair and are unsure about this product, don&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s expensive, but a little goes a very long way. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> One of my fav things. Does wonders for my hair but I only use it on the lower half of my hair and always on the ends.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy/curly, color treated hair.  I use this once a week; I leave it on overnight and do not rinse  it out.  My hair is soft and holds the curls without being weighed down.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It was recommended by my stylist.  We both really noticed a difference in between haircuts.  I blow dry and flatten my hair so it takes some abuse.  This keeps it from getting too damage.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I might put a little in my hair after washing or spray it in a 1-10 solution (1 part product to 10 parts water)  I don&#x27;t rinse it out and it sure does help with the knots in my hair!  The price was much less expensive than purchasing at the solon and you don&#x27;t have to use much to have success!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and has done wonders for my hair! I use it every time I wash my hair and I can never get over the results.</li>
    <li> I recently went from dark hair to blonde hair and with that came some damage. I bought this based on the reviews and I have got to say that when I use this in conjunction with their healing shampoo/conditioner line my hair feels absolutely amazing! It feels nourished, moisturized, and soft. It always looks so healthy and shiny! Money well spent on this- without a doubt!</li>
    <li> Straight hair, no color/chemical. Use daily with or without blow dry/flat iron. Best hair purchase for dry, over processed  hair, any type.</li>
