      <li>the bristles were too soft</li>
      <li>I was taken aback when I could no longer find the original brushes and was a little nervous about purchasing third-party brushes.</li>
      <li>Finally have new brush heads for my old automatic toothbrush.  </li>

    <li> My teeth are cleaner than ever before!!!</li>
    <li> It seems to me that these so-called whitening brushes work the same as other types of SpinBrush brushes.  This is not a bad thing, just don&#x27;t expect whiter teeth unless you use a whitening toothpaste.</li>
    <li> they are the exact ones at the original that came on toothbrushes...</li>
    <li> It worked so well, I cried a little.  This product changed my life.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, good price, free shipping is a definite bonus. Thanks amazon. These things are really hard to find on the trade which is a bit annoying. I had to buy a whole new spin brush recently, simply because I could not locate the replacement heads anywhere! I found them on here after i had bought the second unit. So...... I have  taken another reviewers advice and simply add a pack or two to each amazon order that I do.... Especially now that I have two spin brushes, but they do such an amazing job with my teeth that I am not prepared to switch products at this time. The unit is solid, well made, works well and is  free standing...exactly what I want.</li>
    <li> These did not work...what now throw away the toothbrush???</li>
    <li> Item is as its described and advertised.  I&#x27;m pleased with the price its basically like buying a throw away tooth brush only this gets my teeth much cleaner.  I beleive what makes teeth whiter is the toothpaste used not the bruch used.</li>
    <li> Not sure that it whitens anymore so than it&#x27;s cousins, the cleaning spinbrush replacement heads that fit in the same, but at least it&#x27;s cheaper than Walmart was.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly as listed on amazon.com and was shipped on time. They work great with my spin brush.</li>
    <li> love this for my 5 yr old. cleans well. i ordered from here b/c i couldn&#x27;t find them in the store i was at. the price was good and it saved me time.</li>

    <li> I received the product in a timely fashion and they were just the right ones to fit my Crest Spinbrush.  Cheaper than the store and a perfect fit.  I am very pleased with this product and would order again!</li>
    <li> two pack is the way to go</li>
    <li> after I opened it I realized it was the wrong head I needed the sonic replacement&lt;br /&gt;so I have heads that are of no use to me</li>
    <li> Not what I originally wanted, but they are as good as, if not better!</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t aware how worn my old Crest Spinbrush bristles were until I loaded the new one.  The clean feeling this new head gives my teeth actually inspires me to brush more often.  I do wish I could find a larger package than just two replacement heads.</li>
    <li> I wish I started using a spinbrush many years ago, might have saved some money on dental work.  These replacement heads are great to have on hand since they need to be changed out frequently.  when the bottom section starts filling loose, just pop another one on.  Cheaper to buy on Amazon than local stores in my area.</li>
    <li> Matched the base very well.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal ever! For this price and quality, I am so happy for this purchase. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Good replacement heads for Spinbrush, good price, feel great.</li>
    <li> Terrific price and the product is excellent.  I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer, for sure.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find a toothbrush that removes all stains without having to use a scraper, but this comes close.  It is cost-effective and does a nice job.  Fit my spinbrush and was easy to replace.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> Totally! It works perfect on my Crest Spinbrush Prowhitening.</li>
    <li> Well made - lasted quite a while!</li>
    <li> Fit toothbrush perfectly and works great!</li>
    <li> These fit perfectly on my SpinBrush and work great!</li>
    <li> I like the dual action of these electric toothbrush heads, and we&#x27;re very satisfied with our Spinbrush Prowhitening battery-operated toothbrush, which these heads are exclusively designed to fit onto. A great value.</li>
    <li> Good price....never used!  LOL</li>
    <li> Really like my spinbrush prowhitening toothbrush. the replacement heads don&#x27;t fit as well as the original, doesn&#x27;t fit on straight, but it still works well, just a little akward to use.</li>
    <li> It is a refill - what is there to say.</li>
    <li> This product arrived open.  The outside shipping packaging was sealed properly but the actual packaging of the product was open.  When I lifted the toothbrush from the shipping package the toothbrush heads fell to the floor.  Approximately 75% of the seal around the product package was missing.</li>
    <li> Great to have an extra 1 or 2.....but these last a long time.</li>
    <li> This teeth brush heads are just fantastic, for the price I paid it is more than worth to buy it.</li>
    <li> The Spinbrush Pro Whitening Soft Bristle Replacement Heads are so awesome. After replacing my six-month-old head that was worn out, I could certainly feel the difference on my teeth as they felt more polished and clean. I have the tendency with manual toothbrushes to overdo the brushing, so the Spinbrush heads work best for me because I just let the spinbrush do the work.</li>

    <li> A new brush head and a couple of batteries renew a spinbrush for half the cost of a new one.</li>
    <li> never got to use it because it was the wrong kind, found out after I already opened the package. wish they would of worked.</li>
    <li> the bristles were too soft</li>
    <li> Thanks.  Finally have new brush heads for my old automatic toothbrush.  Couldn&#x27;t find them at the various drug stores in town, so looked on Amazon.  Glad I don&#x27;t have to throw out a perfectly good appliance for lack of replacement parts.  And ever since I&#x27;ve been using this auto-brush, my dentist hasn&#x27;t complained about my gums. Ease of use and better dental care - score!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT, GETS THE JOB DONE, SAW A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WITH THE WHITENESS OF MY TEETH.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and will not stop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt,&lt;br /&gt;HavanaTwistsHairstyles.com</li>
    <li> I bought the Spinbrush Toothbrush from Amazon and bought these replacement heads at the same time.  Amazon stated that these where the correct replacement head for the toothbrush I bought.  They were not.  Did not try to return because it had been 3 months since I bought them.  Misleading.</li>
    <li> does a great job..just as good as the more costly brands...</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of automatic brushes .. these ones are especially nice because most others can be hard on the gums</li>
    <li> My teeth are no whiter than before and I don&#x27;t get that smoothness after brushing anymore. I&#x27;ve been using this since December 2014.</li>
    <li> Makes cleaning teeth almost effortless.  Tried other brands but the Spinbrush is the best and easiest to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fits my spinbrush; couldn&#x27;t find correct brush replacements at CVS.  Got them quickly.  They last a pretty long time, too.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations in product quality. Service in delivery excellent.</li>
    <li> A good price for a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and like these replacement brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Pleased to know they can be purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really fit, you can get it to work but its sideways and annoying</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to keep my electric tooth brush in service.</li>
</ol>
