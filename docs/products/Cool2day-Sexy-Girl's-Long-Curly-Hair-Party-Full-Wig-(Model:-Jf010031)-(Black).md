<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the first thing i did when i got it out of it&#x27;s package is brush it, and the entire bottom half is now an unruly mess that is impossible to untangle.</li>
    <li> This wig is nowhere near as long or straight (wavy?) as it appears. It hits me at my lower shoulder blades, and I am very petite. However, it doesn&#x27;t tangle, and it looks very nice! It&#x27;s not what I was expecting, and I&#x27;ll need to buy something else, but this wig is nice for the price.</li>
    <li> well i knew i wasnt suppose to expect brazillian so it was as expected, i clipped the front into a bang and wear it to work, its great, only that the strap pulls easily but it will not fall off anyways, its great, good job</li>
    <li> It looks exactly as pictured but the bangs are kinda really long u might need to cut them. Its kinda big wont fit snug on ur head. But for the price not bad would buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig for my god tier Jade Harley cosplay, and it sucked. It was too small, BROWN, and couldn&#x27;t go four seconds without tangling. Would not recommend or buy again.</li>
    <li> Long and beautiful, the quality excels what I thought I would get at such a price. Though it doesn&#x27;t come with a hair net or anything, which was slightly irritating.</li>
    <li> This wig is thin and small!! Fits about half my head. I got it for my jade god teir cosplay, man, I&#x27;m glad a hood is going to cover up how this thing barely reaches my occipital bone.</li>
    <li> I used it for a cosplay of Vriska from Homestuck. It worked well for my purposes, though it tangles very easily. because of my character, i could get away with having a messy wig. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and its still in decent shape.</li>
    <li> It came in right on schedule and The bangs are a little too long but they swoop to the side perfectly. The length is nice and it really is full; it kind of made my head look big but I found the right style where it doesn&#x27;t look too big (To one side). I&#x27;m 14 and I love it.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give it 5 stars but...&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately.. the packaging was damaged and its a lot curlier than the picture shows. But other than that.. It feels real, no strange smell, super soft, just the right amount of shine. A perfect first wig!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t except this wig to be as full as maybe a person with long, curly, thick hair, but it definitely was! Color was even all around, felt real to the touch, and even the look of it! It had a shine to it but not like &amp;#34;oh i&#x27;m a wig&amp;#34; shine. Bangs were perfect for me how they swept over because I wear my hair like that normally. This wig fit perfectly on my head and was very secure. No complaints here. Will be buying more Cool2Day products in the future. :)</li>
    <li> Hair quality and color of the Cool2day wigs are very good; however, they run really small. I would not consider their sizing guidelines to be of average sizing. I would recommend the wig to those with a smaller cranium, and not much hair, or for a child. I like the pictured style, but it may fit someone with a smaller head much more comfortably, the way it is pictured. The straps only help to stabilize the wig(s) minimally.</li>
    <li> Nice color, ok construction but cap was &amp;#34;too&amp;#34; small for an average size adult head.  It would possibly fit a child&#x27;s head.</li>
    <li> i am using this wig for a jade harley cosplay, and i absolutely love it!!!! its kind of tangly at first, but it does look very natural and it fits very well :-)</li>
    <li> This wig looks lovely! It did shed a little when I took it out of the package and tried it on, but I expected that after reading a lot of reviews. I think it might be a bit shorter than it looks in the pictures. It really looks like real hair, and there&#x27;s not a huge amount of shine that I&#x27;ve seen on some wigs. I&#x27;m glad I bought it, I think it&#x27;s a great first wig</li>
    <li> Was a good wig for the price. Nice gorgeous length and color. My only complaint is that it does tangle easy and gets kind of nappy at the ends. I tried spraying leave in conditioner on thinking that would work but didnt and just seemed to knott more when i tried to brush it. Its deff not an every day use wig.</li>
    <li> Came nicely packaged and arrived very early. It is definitely black. It&#x27;s not as long as the wig shown, and the bangs do not come styled. Overall nice buy. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I got This Wig Fast.It was In excellent Condition.I also got a cute pair of socks as a gift.The wig itself Is amazing.</li>
    <li> the wigs looks nothing like the photo very short wig fits like a childs wig very small i dont like the wig at all</li>
    <li> The wig feels nice and is very true to color. The only problem I have with it, is that is tangles very easily. YOU MUST invest in a wig brush. Other than that I love it. I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> The wig was absolutely beautiful, but it tangled way too easily...WAY TOO EASILY. The wig also tends to shed often...</li>
    <li> Great price!!! I received tons of compliments, will definitely order again!  It was a long wait, but definitely worth it! :)</li>
    <li> It is a good qulality wig but it doesn&#x27;t have as much hair on it. It&#x27;s not as full as I want it to be. But good for homestuck people like my sister so I gave it to her.</li>
    <li> Great wig for the price. I am very happy with this it will work great for my costume this year.</li>
    <li> When I first put on the wig I loved it. It fits my head perfectly and I liked the length. After I put it on I I try brushing a small section lightly to make the curls look neat but it i noticed it was tangled. Then I tried to put my fingers through the rest and found that it tangled really badly. After a little more brushing the ends are almost completely frizzy. I like everything about the wigs expect the ends. It is a shiny like some quick weave hair style but I do not mind that plus I hard washing may take away the shine.</li>
    <li> I love love love my wig.  It looks so natural to me.  I&#x27;ve taken dozens of photos in it and no one suspects a thing.  I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> Great Quality for the price. Its very thin, but that can be easily fixed. It&#x27;s perfect for my Beth Cosplay from The Bravest Warriors. It&#x27;s awesome quality though it does tangle quite easily.</li>
    <li> So far the wig is wonderful! Good quality, nice length.... Looks good on.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for cosplaying Homestuck&#x27;s Vriska Serket but honestly it could work for pretty much any of the girls.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Wig is nice but a bit small. It didn&#x27;t fit my head but I had no trouble returning it.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I have ever bought a wig and I felt fabulous in it. It was way too long though, and I had to trim a few inches off, just to brush it!! Perhaps I should get a wig brush...? But that may be, because I am not use to having long hair. It does get tangled easily though, and a few strands of hair keep falling out. I do not wear it every day for fear I may pull all the loose hairs out, out of habit. I absolutely love it though, and I wear it on special occassions. The bangs are stylish and it feels good to the fingers. My husband also loves it on me! ;) I am highly considering on buying more wigs from cool2day!! Remember, this is only a 20 dollar wig. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> i just received this wig and it feels and looks very real its very pretty Im totally in love with it i bought it to use in Halloween... i wish i could use it on a daily basis but its too long ppl will notice its a wig...its shiny but in natural way... very impressed with the material...i will probably trim it :P totally recommend! lots of fun</li>
    <li> This is the most natural hair wig that I bought from Cool2day. I love love love this wig. I saw some of the other reviews on this wig and I was kind of afraid to buy it, so I purchased it anyways and when I received it was sooooo much better in person. Just don&#x27;t go by what you like and don&#x27;t just read into someone&#x27;s else opinion because their opinion is not sometimes not true. Now imma tell you the truth the wig is very long and I am 5&#x27;1. The wig does shed but if you spray a little hair spray and apply a little moose and a wide tooth comb you should be fine. Oh I forgot to mention detangler and let it air dry it will be good. The wig looks very natural and fits my head frame perfectly. I put a little makeup in the wig to make the parting looking realistic and no one can tell its fake because I have very long hair anyways. I love love love this wig and this is my third one I bought. I would say try it out you might like it too. :)</li>
    <li> Lovely. It feels soft and barely tangled. Only problem I have is when you take pictures with a flash, it has an intense shine to it. Otherwise I love it!</li>
    <li> Great wig if you are doing Homestuck cosplay. Well made. Arrived fast and in good shape. Even came with a free gift. What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
    <li> I got my package today and I already love it the hair looks so natural and is very soft I would highly recommend this product if your are looking for something for a specail night out or for everyday wear its perfect</li>
    <li> This wig looks pretty close to the picture, which was a relief. Just what I needed for Comic Con!&lt;br /&gt;It got tangled at the ends when I tried to braid it (my fault probably!), and it&#x27;s a bit flat on my head, but its a really lovely wig. The thickness is just right to look like real hair and it doesn&#x27;t possess too much of that fake shine. My head fits the wig really nicely too. The wig is really long (it falls all the way to my waist) so I may need to take off an inch or two. Haven&#x27;t worn it out and about yet, but I&#x27;m confident it will do the job!</li>
    <li> Purchased this wig for Akali cosplay and was stunned by the quality, it looks and feels real. Very very soft and pretty!</li>
    <li> Goodnight Product arrived quickly and well, very seriously recommended the purchase 100%, no detail, and size is the corect perfer</li>
    <li> I also bought this item for a friend of mine the hair color was closer to hers and she enjoyed this item very much</li>
    <li> I got this wig a while ago and overall its fairly good for the price. It came much curlier than in the picture but I had expected that based from the other customer photos. It was about the same length as shown which was the exact that I needed.It also came rather quickly. the package was a little battered and the wig had a certain muskyish smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;As for styling and the fibers, the fibers are soft at first but after some use it frizzes like crazy. The bangs have to be put carefully so that the front part doesn&#x27;t show through.It tangles and sheds quite a bit, but that is expected of long wigs. Luckily the wig responds great to heat styling and straightening it takes out the bad frizz, but for curling I reccomend using a different method from any heat tool.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem was that the skin top came damaged and half detached. Also the some of the wefts in that area had parts that weren&#x27;t attached to the netting. I managed to make it look presentable and reattach some things but it was still a pain to deal with&lt;br /&gt;Overall the wig was good for the price and decent overall. I would reccomend for anyone looking for a wig with a small budget.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to deal with. It tangles a lot at first, but it&#x27;s nothing a bit of detangling spray (half a bottle in my case) can&#x27;t help. It&#x27;s size adjustable and it looks really good. The length goes about halfway down my back, and I didn&#x27;t have to cut any part of it because it looked good right off the bat. It was definitely worth much more than the bit of money that I shelled over for it, and I&#x27;m really happy I got it. (:</li>
    <li> THIS WIG IS REALLY SILKY. YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF IT. BUT ITS NOT AN EVERYDAY WEAR. WEAR IT WHEN YOU GO OUT OR JUST WANT TO LOOK LIKE A MOVIE STAR . THIS WIG IS FOR YOU. BUT ME MYSELF I WEAR IT EVERYDAY CAUSE I WEAR IT EVERYDAY IM LAZY WHEN IT COMES TO MY REAL HAIR. BUT ITS A NICE WIG. YOU WON &#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED. I BOUGHT MORE THAN ONE.</li>
    <li> I like how thick the hair is, there&#x27;s a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;but it sheds a lot, so be carful. but the curls are so so sooo pretty. and the color isn&#x27;t jet black, but a natural black, very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;the head is made for a very tiny head though. and the bangs need some cutting. they&#x27;re way too long.</li>
    <li> Very full and beautiful. Looks pretty close to real. She has put it one, but not worn it out yet. I am sure she will have a ton of fun with it. Free shipping also :) Will order again.</li>
    <li> For the price I was expecting something stringy and dingy, this thing looks like real hair! I might even where it more often than just halloween!</li>
    <li> This wig is so freaking awesome! It took forever to come in the mail, but hey it was well worth the wait. It looks so real when you put it on. Will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> I looooove it !!! I wear it almost every day!:)&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed at how it looked . Buy itttt :)</li>
    <li> I love the wig....It is exactly how it looks in the picture...It is a bit long so I had to cut it....If you get a wide tooth brush and some oil sheen or wig spray, this will help with the tangles....I&#x27;ve only had the wig for a day but Im sure if I take care of it, it will last for some time (or until I get bored with the look.) My 3 year old daughter even told me I look beautiful and that everyone will say Im beautiful too...Thanks Again!</li>
    <li> it was okay until it started tangling the next day I got it. no matter what I did It would not stop tangling.</li>
    <li> This is the second wig I&#x27;;ve received from this brand of wigs through amazon. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!! It actually looks better in person than the display! It&#x27;s super soft, and once you shake it out a bit, it&#x27;s nice and full. Again, I&#x27;ll be using this one on another photo shoot, and have already placed several more orders from this seller tonight. I have to order more wig stands now just to keep up! Lol! But I&#x27;ve been wearing wigs for years. I&#x27;ve paid nearly $300 for synthetic wigs that weren&#x27;t really much better than this! Infact, one of my regular photographers is so impressed, she placed several orders to have some in stock for her wardrobe!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much since it was so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The color is more of a greyish brown than black.&lt;br /&gt;It was really shiny but I washed it and added baby powder to it to get rid of that.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely tangles easily. This is definitely a costume wig. I would only wear it with a hat</li>
    <li> it is a very,very dark brown, but still quite noticeable! it is the right length and it is styled correctly, but if you are looking for a dark , definitely black wig then this is not quite it! (i use it for homestuck troll cosplay, so i needed black, it is close enough to pass if you need it, though)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my cousin just for fun and it just so happen that she is falling in love it. She is happy with it so am I .so I will buy from seller again.</li>
    <li> This hair is amazingly soft for it to be 100% kanekalon. The curls are actually very wavy, but the bangs are easily trimmed and don&#x27;t lose the slight curl. Great wig for the price. If you know how to manage and retouch synthetic hair, you&#x27;ll be fine. This is my every day wig for about two weeks, I will definitely make another purchase!! Ladies she is an amazing hair piece to add to any wardrobe!!</li>
    <li> Piece of s***! PLEASE for the love of everything do not buy this...</li>
    <li> The wig is good for a couple of days but then it tangles up into a bunch.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was expecting a long wait after reading in the comments but I ordered and, even in standard shipping, got my item in exactly two days.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the wig is fantastic though is a bit thin in the back. It&#x27;s got a nice hairline edge and looks and feels realistic. It looks like the picture and is the right length. This is a very good buy and worth the money.</li>
    <li> It looked beautiful when it came, Very realistic and soft but&lt;br /&gt;after 2 weeks it got tangled at the bottom and when you brush it&lt;br /&gt;A LOT of the hair comes out, So after a while it just starts to look raggedy.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
    <li> I really love this wig. It is my very first and it looks so natural. It was very easy to put on, and the hair itself felt so real and so soft. I am so happy now, I feel beautiful and I really love this wig. The shipping was faster then what the seller had put down and I was very happy about that. I am so going to order from this seller all the time! Defientaly a 100 rate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> as a first wig, this was okay. it looked fantastic out of the package, but shortly thereafter became a tangled, frizzy mess.&lt;br /&gt;the wefts aren&#x27;t sewed in too securely so it will shed like crazy, and in some places it&#x27;s become thin just from the shedding. the cap is kind of snug too, but for someone with a smaller head the elastics on the outside will help to secure it well. the color is accurate and fresh out of the bag it was silky smooth, but again, given any time this wig will become tangled. after washing, drying, applying some defrizzing product, brushing, and braiding the tangle is better but the frizz is still really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the product taught me a lot about caring for wigs, but most importantly it&#x27;s taught me that splurging on more expensive wigs is not a bad thing to consider for next time.</li>
    <li> Alright, first off, when it says it ships in 4-5 days, it might, but they don&#x27;t ship it for another like 15 days, it took a month a get here.&lt;br /&gt;The wig fibers are soft and don&#x27;t seem to fray or be frayed easily, it doesn&#x27;t tangle as much other long wigs.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s shiny, that&#x27;s to be expected of a synthetic wig, but nothing a little powder or a fabric softener treatment can&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;However it&#x27;s very thin and does not have much volume at all, though really for the price...&lt;br /&gt;But what really got me was how easily it shed, it was probably on my head for 20 minutes and the stray hair fibers were everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely not a resilient wig and is NOT GOOD FOR COSPLAY OR DAILY WEAR, I mean if you&#x27;re planning on wearing it for an hour to take pictures it&#x27;s fine but it&#x27;s gonna also take some clever manipulation to look nice...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fair value wig though, the fibers are nice, but to make this wig acceptable it&#x27;s going to take a bit of work. What I&#x27;ve done is order 2 more of these wigs (though 1 more may be enough) (ordered these wigs two weeks ago, still waiting) Anyway, I plan on ripping the wefts from these wigs and sewing them onto the first wig to make it thicker. I&#x27;m also going to be applying Fray Check to the weft in order to try and stop the shedding. It&#x27;s a bit of a stretch here but in the end it&#x27;s cheaper than buying something like an Arda wig, it just takes a bit of work.&lt;br /&gt;However, in general, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS WIG!!!</li>
    <li> It shed immediately. It looked super shines and super fake. DONT buy this wig is a waste of money. However it did ship fast. This wig was so fustrating. I hated it and I will never buy one like it again.</li>
    <li> looks just like the picture. needs a little trimming to fit my face shape. other than that it&#x27;s exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> It tangles a lot but it is fixable. Some detangler and hair spray. It&#x27;s kind of shiny but it was only 7 dollars so I think I got what I paid for. Nice with a hat.</li>
    <li> This wig is better than the other one from Cool Day that was ordered, not bad. It had to be cut though, it  was way too long.</li>
    <li> I was happy to hear all the positive feed, But I&#x27;m truly not impress with it. It&#x27;s a great costume wig but it&#x27;s definitely not an everyday wear thing. And I found it kind of hard to keep the bangs out of my face and it just falls weird around the face. It&#x27;s really thin as well. Like I said it&#x27;s a costume wear not an everyday wear or clubbing thing. lol. And just like the other comments it does tangle easy. It was a perfect fit for my head, but I&#x27;m sure some of my friends with fuller heads lol will not be able to fit it. It was delivered very fast and the packaging was right no complains with the seller with that. But for future wig purchase I think I&#x27;ll be buying them at a Beauty store.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the reason for the 2 stars. :-)</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful, though gets a bit easily tangled as I mentioned. I took it out to wear around town the other day to do some shopping and was stopped by three people noting how lovely my \\&quot;hair\\&quot; was. They did not believe me when I told them it was a wig. It&#x27;s also great if you&#x27;re into modeling and have short hair like I do, the wig cap that came with it was very appreciated. The texture, though a bit plastic-like was natural enough, like freshly dyed hair (so you could easily pass it off as \\&quot;Oh I just colored it last night.\\&quot; I will need some sort of special brush though to deal with these tangles, but that&#x27;s the ONLY thing keeping this from a five-star review. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a few people who saw photos of me wearing it.</li>
    <li> This wig was a lot of fun to wear and I had a lot of fun wearing it.  I got lots of compliments on the wig.  I really will order this wig again in the future.  Very sexy</li>
    <li> I ordered the wig and when it arrived it was ok but as soon as I took it out of the bag and placed it on my mannequin head, it began to tangle.  I brushed it out continiously and it just tangled more.  I would say save your money and buy another wig.</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my Jade Harley cosplay and I&#x27;m really happy with it. It&#x27;s really light and comfortable, the color is very nice. The bangs look great, especially when you are wearing glasses. Overall, great purchase and I recommend it for Homestuck cosplay :)</li>
    <li> If you are really into wigs I highly recommend this wig for you. I was scared at first to purchase but omg,everyone keeps comlplimenting me on it. You can&#x27;t beat the price too which is a plus. It do get tangled though, but oh well!!</li>
    <li> This wig is cute but only with a hat. The bangs are awkward and the curls look nothing like they do in the picture. It might as well be a straight wig. It&#x27;s also very shiny. I tried taking the shine down with baby powder but that didn&#x27;t help much. It took about 15 days to arrive (which is to be expected) and it came in a bag. Like I stated earlier it looks decent or cute with a hat but I won&#x27;t be wearing it without one.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a multi functional wig, that you can put up in a pony, or let it down for a night on the town. This is the wig for you. Remember it&#x27;s synthetic and you might can get 2 months use out of it if you take care of it. But for such a cheap price I would buy this over and over and over again. It does get tangled but it&#x27;s synthetic. I haven&#x27;t tried to put heat on it and probably won&#x27;t try to.</li>
    <li> I got this for my Jade Harley cosplay and was surprised with how soft the fibers were. It&#x27;s just like in the pictures. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with size or length, I would definitely recommend this for any cosplay.</li>
    <li> VEry nice for price in my opinion. I like it very much. yes I do. I do like it. yes</li>
    <li> I love the wig, and I received it way before schedule. I had ordered it for a Fem!Crowley (supernatural) cosplay and it was scheduled to arrive the day before the convention ( August 6). I just received it today, July 26. The packaging was no damaged and the wig was packed very nicely. It tangles easily, but I was able to brush it out with a wide tooth comb. The bangs are a bit long and it is a tiny bit small, but it still looks extremely good and very natural.</li>
    <li> I expected this to be just like the wigs I buy at the costume stores, but this wig is so soft an pretty.  It is much better than any other wigs I have seen.  I bought it a month before Halloween, however, it did not come until a month after Halloween, so I will keep it and use it for next year.</li>
    <li> I am not happy because this wig is brown and also shedding. The description should not state it is black when it is brown.</li>
    <li> Beyond perfect for my costume. Really shiny, fits great, love the color, and its longer than expected. Wish there were more colors !</li>
    <li> The wig was home made...not a problem. The wig cap was way to big. I don&#x27;t have a small head. After I cut and straightened it...it was okay. No...I would not recommend this wig.</li>
    <li> Just got this wig today!! It came in a small sized baggie packaging. It came with a free weaving cap, and also the wig came in a appropriate sized zip lock bag. Its long and beautiful, and the (Japanese)Kanekalon that it&#x27;s made out of is FAR SUPERIOR to what is sold in my home town. The tracks were neatly sewn together, and above one another. i noticed this as i was searching for them parting through the wig itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when i put it on, it was really comfortable and it fit snug. It&#x27;s silky and smooth to the touch. The black is a OFF BLACK, which means the difference will only be noticed really up close... almost micro-scopic!! The way the size looked before I put it on, i thought it would be too big!! But it fit just right. It barely tangled, only a few times. And also it sheds, but i found a solution for this as I&#x27;ve had this problem in the past when i started making wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS TO HELP THE SHEDDING:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn the cap inside out, and get a small bottle of super glue, and squeeze it and run it along the lines of the tracks. Do this throughout the WHOLE ENTIRE CAP. AFTER YOU DO THAT, LET IT COMPLETELY DRY, GLUE AND ALL, AND THEN PUT IT BACK ON AND TEST IT TO SEE HOW IT WILL DO WITH SHEDDING. I know it may sound like a lot, but after I did it, it made a difference in the shedding, and now it is pretty minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering MORE WIGS from now on, as i want a variety of styles and colors. Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, A TIP IF TAOBAOPIT READ REVIEWS FREQUENTLY, PLEASE ADD ANOTHER LINE OF STITCH TO THE WEFTS TO CUT DOWN THE SHEDDING. I MAY also be doing a video review of this on Youtube!!</li>
    <li> fab, fab fab, no complains besides the obvious tangle, but just braid it when putting it away and u will have less of that</li>
    <li> Great wig; gets easily tangled. It&#x27;s nice and thick at the top. The part is a little hard to find tho.</li>
    <li> I love this wig! It makes me feel so fabulous! I had originally bought it to wear for Halloween but after getting it and wearing it around and getting the feedback I have gotten on it, I might have to wear it more and buy more colors/styles! Sure, it gets tangled easily, it&#x27;s not real hair! Just keep a brush with you and brush the ends out  when you get a few minutes and it will look great all day. It fits great as long as you use the straps/clips in it correctly. The only reason the people I know have known it&#x27;s a wig is because I naturally have thin, blonde hair. People who don&#x27;t know me, don&#x27;t even notice. Just buy it, and have fun!</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time. The color was a dark brown and not black. Wig cap was a bit small. The quality and style is great,especially for the price. I was afraid it would be too shiny,but it has the right amount of sheen. It was easy to alter. It would be a great intro wig. Definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> This wig was terrible in my opinion. Only two stars because it stayed on pretty well.... it was too shiny to come off as real hair.its too full to pull off as real hair, its too FAKE, its definitely not a everyday style, I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable in it when wearing it out, like I knew people knew it was fake. Its good enough for Halloween. Perhaps it depends on your head shape, if you can fit it on your head shape and pull it off and can pull off waxy looking thick hair...its perfect.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, but only could wear it twice for the hair tangles incredibly easily and is now in one big knot.  The hair is quite thin, which is ok, but it gets in knots like you would not believe.  I managed to gently brush it out once but it looks terrible now.  I may try to cut the long parts off and make it into a short wig (what a shame!) but the long hair is just a total mess.  And by the way, I am an experienced wig wearer and have been wearing many styles for over 15 years and also took wig making and care classes, so don&#x27;t think it is just me.</li>
