      <li>/&gt;ENJOY!! :D</li>
      <li>and it was awesome.</li>
      <li>it would be awesome!!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s animal cruelty free!!!!</li>
      <li>The product, however, is fabulous!!!!</li>
      <li>I guess I could make my own, but this is just so convenient!!</li>
      <li>Good product!</li>
      <li>Otherwise great, I can go 4 days without washing my hair, without it 2 days.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>works great.</li>
      <li>Great Product.</li>
      <li>What I like it for is it works great in a punch.</li>
      <li>One thing this WOULD be great for is if you need your hair to have texture for an &amp;#34;up</li>
      <li>I just sprinkled some into my hands and then worked it through my hair, then repeated until I was happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>like I said, my hair looks great.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks great</li>
      <li>It adds great volume.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>This is a great buy.  </li>
      <li>smell very nice, its organic wich is all that matters for me...</li>
      <li>This is amazing!</li>
      <li>for a good, clean product!!!</li>
      <li>This is good for spot treatment to absorb oil</li>
      <li>I apply it, then spray my hair with water, reapply mousse, hairspray, etc, scrunch it and its good to go.  </li>
      <li>The product works good.</li>
      <li>and then it kind of works</li>
      <li>and fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy and comfortable with all of the ingredients in this product, and very excited about the packaging.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do a very good job absorbing the oil.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure Klorane is great, but I&#x27;m quite happy with Acure and see no reason to pay the extra money.</li>
      <li>it seems that you might be able to use it on clean hair to achieve texture, so maybe that&#x27;s a good thing??</li>
      <li>It is great for adding volume to my very fine hair and I can use three days straight until wetting hair again.</li>
      <li>Very much recommend!!!</li>
      <li>approves of product and its sulfate free!</li>
      <li>And I didn&#x27;t love dispensing into my hands and working into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>better than any I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t mind having to explain to people why it looks like you have baby powder on your head.</li>
      <li>It was also challenging to distribute this product evenly throughout my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave this a try.</li>
      <li>And it adds texture! :-)</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work any better than my baby powder with cornstarch/vitamin e that I was using before.  </li>
      <li>but I will gladly use this to avoid the chemicals</li>
      <li>Okay a couple things here...</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t buy it again, though I love that it is organic.  </li>
      <li>This has a light scent that is nice.</li>
      <li>but just isn&#x27;t my favorite product.</li>
      <li>There are better products out there that cost more.</li>
      <li>I love Acure products and use their shampoo&#x27;s and conditoner&#x27;s as well as their argan oil.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used better... &amp; not a fan of &amp;#34;puffing&amp;#34; the product onto my hair.</li>
      <li>(I just have to make sure not to miss any or it looks like I have dandruff).  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for something more substantial so that I could go without shampooing every day.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a good product, a fun novelty, an interesting concept.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>It just seemed to give my hair an even more textured, piece-y look.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unless I find something better -- without aerosol and chemicals that allows me to have fresh-non-perfumy smelling hair that doesn&#x27;t look oily -- I will be purchasing this again.</li>
      <li>works well nice clean product</li>
      <li>loved it the first day.  </li>
      <li>works wonderfully and lasts for a long time!</li>
      <li>I am so excited to have found this!</li>
      <li>This is the best dry shampoo I have used yet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like touching flour which I don&#x27;t enjoy for whatever reason.</li>
      <li>it would be nice to have a dry shampoo i didn&#x27;t have to fuss with, but this will do in the meantime and it does a great job at sucking up any oil and adding volume.</li>
      <li>Wow, I guess I am in the minority on my opinion, but I really, really love this stuff!!  </li>
      <li>Compact and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I like the cute autumn leaf design on the packaging, it blends nicely into my neutral themed bathroom, but thatis really neither here nor there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is the consistency of corn starch, and does not blend into hair easily.</li>
      <li>I have to apply it without my clothes on because it IS a powder and will get on my clothes, but comes off the clothes easily</li>
      <li>I am happy to apply it with an ounce more effort to save my head from really gross chemicals, like aluminum oxide and propane.&lt;br /&gt;Yay</li>
      <li>The tube clogs up easily, so I just take the lid off and pour it into my hand.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about Klorane dry shampoo, but before shelling out the money for it, I looked around to see if there was another powder that was more affordable.</li>
      <li>Kudos for being cruelty free and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(My hair is very fine and my scalp very oily)  </li>
      <li>I even use it on clean hair just to add volume.</li>
      <li>It looks great, but feels so so dry.</li>
      <li>This powder does make your hair LOOK clean, but it does not make it feel clean.  </li>
      <li>It also looks more natural then dousing it on the top of your head.</li>
      <li>Made it look really clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>This is a great dry shampoo!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s bright white, which on my brown hair looked chalky and ashy.</li>
      <li>I currently had (and loved).</li>
      <li>I loved the idea of saving my hair from daily washings, which was damaging and drying out my hair.</li>
      <li>Very fast and easy transaction.  </li>
      <li>The top of this container is very similar to the top of some spice containers-</li>
      <li>However, my hair has more body and is healthier without the daily shampooing, and I have more &amp;#34;get ready&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I am so glad I decided to order this and will always make sure I have it on hand in the future.</li>
      <li>I normally have had better luck with powders, so I opted to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I normally use the Fekkai Pronto Powder or the Khlorane spray, but I wanted to see if there was anything else out there that might work better.</li>
      <li>Plus when I looked at the ingredients I quickly did a pinterest search and ended up making my own organic one for much less :)</li>
      <li>I have fine, wavy hair and this gives my hair so much bounce and body.  </li>
      <li>It has no smell, which is fine with me, and I don&#x27;t have to use that much.</li>
      <li>Great traveling product if you don&#x27;t need to wash your hair everyday.</li>
      <li>It offers more even distribution.</li>
      <li>Add more if you need it, but never pour directly on your scalp.  </li>
      <li>Lots of gentle squeezes to the bottle seem to work better than vigorous squeezing, which will release too much product in one place.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love dry shampoos for my super fine oily hair.  </li>
      <li>but I got the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to accidentally use too much, but it brushes out fairly readily.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, oily, blonde hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various dry shampoos for many years. I really like the fact these products rate well on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database but this product is really difficult to use. Normally when you squeeze the bottle, the dry shampoo comes out in a mist or a puff. This one takes so much effort to shake, squeeze and aim compared to others I&#x27;ve used. I wasted a bunch of it as it ended up on me but not in my hair and on the floor. I&#x27;ll be going back to my tried and true Klorane dry shampoo when I&#x27;m done with this.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I just sprinkle it on the areas that might look greasy or shiny and brush it in. It gives my thin hair a nice volume too.</li>
    <li> This is just awful! It clumps in your hair and smells bad. It is the consistency of corn starch, and does not blend into hair easily. I will be sending this back.</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying dry shampoo, I liked what is did to my greasy hair but I have nothing to compare it to. Overall I recommend this and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic and free from harsh chemicals and aluminum like other popular brand dry shampoos...but it doesn&#x27;t work any better than my baby powder with cornstarch/vitamin e that I was using before.  i like that it&#x27;s scentless, but it makes my hair feel chalky and tangly.  The baby powder still leaves my hair feeling silky.  I have long, fine brown hair.  I just mix a very little bit of this with the baby powder...and the bottle is 3-4 times smaller than the baby powder but twice expensive.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll be purchasing again...</li>
    <li> I tried this because I was trying be a bit more environmentally friendly and avoid using the aerosol can of dry shampoo I currently had (and loved). Well, this stuff was gross. I&#x27;ve tried it all different ways and it just leaves my hair oily and unmanageable. Back to the aerosol.</li>
    <li> loved it the first day.  Hard to squeeze the powder out though.  you have to tip the bottle upside down in order to squeeze a puff of air into the powder.  Then, when it does come out, it is a big hit of white.  If you&#x27;re not careful,  you&#x27;ll have a big white mark on your scalp (which I really couldn&#x27;t rub in) so I had to throw my hair up.  Works if you put it on your hand and carefully blend in. Won&#x27;t buy it again, though I love that it is organic.  reminds me of when I would use baby powder (before dry shampoo was a big thing) and feels like the same experience.</li>
    <li> works well nice clean product</li>
    <li> Had to return it as couldn&#x27;t even get the top open for the powder to come out.  Very disappointing. Plus when I looked at the ingredients I quickly did a pinterest search and ended up making my own organic one for much less :)</li>
    <li> Does work okay but I do not like the dispenser. Did not like the way my hair felt after using it. I see that they have redesigned the packaging since my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. It is great for adding volume to my very fine hair and I can use three days straight until wetting hair again. I get my hair colored at salons and stylist approves of product and its sulfate free!</li>
    <li> Leaves a SUPER white sheen to hair.  Even with rubbing it in, hair is thickly coated with white residue.  If this product could be tinted to match hair color it would be awesome!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for camping because my hair looks greasy after two days without a shampoo. You just shake some into your hands, work it into your hair, and brush your hair. It seemed like it took a little while to see a difference, but my hair looked clean and full after using it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works fine but the squeeze bottle is hard to use -it exits sideways so it makes it hard to get to.</li>
    <li> I love Acure&#x27;s shampoo line, and I was hoping to find a dry shampoo that was not full of junk and chemicals, but this just doesn&#x27;t perform well. It&#x27;s essentially no different from baby powder. It&#x27;s bright white, which on my brown hair looked chalky and ashy. I suppose it took some of the grease away and gave a little lift to my otherwise limp hair, but it felt so yucky on my scalp and left a white residue that I&#x27;m sorry I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I do not like the dry shampoo aerosol although it&#x27;s easier to apply. My husband is always saying the aerosol is killing my brain! lol Anyways, I tried this powder in an effort to not use aerosol and like it. I have used baby powder in the past but of course, you smell like a baby. This has a light scent that is nice. You do not need to use much to get rid of the oil. I usually go a couple days without washing my hair so this is good for that if you do not want to hose yourself down with aerosol dry shampoo!</li>
    <li> I have been using Acure Organics Dry Shampoo for several months, at first for just those days when I couldn&#x27;t wash my hair. I have very fine, oily, blonde hair. For me, if I apply it and then brush my hair very well before bed, I wake up with nice-looking hair. Before using this, I&#x27;d wake up with flat, oily hair. I apply on any spots that look shiny, and I can now go two to three days in between washing. After years and years of everyday shampooing, it has taken a while to get used to not having that &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; feeling. However, my hair has more body and is healthier without the daily shampooing, and I have more &amp;#34;get ready&amp;#34; time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that it isn&#x27;t an aerosol and isn&#x27;t full of nasty ingredients like other brands I&#x27;ve seen. There really isn&#x27;t a scent, which I prefer, and my hair smells fresh. Also, it seems to last quite a while, and I use it liberally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two big drawbacks are that it will make your hair look &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t get it thoroughly brushed in. (Yesterday, my husband told me he hadn&#x27;t noticed I&#x27;m getting quite gray until then--I hadn&#x27;t fully brushed out the dry shampoo! Haha!) Secondly, my hair gets quite a bit of static when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless I find something better -- without aerosol and chemicals that allows me to have fresh-non-perfumy smelling hair that doesn&#x27;t look oily -- I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come out very well and leaves my hair feeling oily and dirty. Really had high hopes for this dry shampoo but I think I&#x27;ll stick to Klorane.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I have used yet.</li>
    <li> Eh it doesn&#x27;t really work if my hair is greasy.  So I don&#x27;t really see the point since I bought it so I could go that last day before washing without looking greasy but if I put a lot of it it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m putting baby powder and then it kind of works</li>
    <li> As others have noted this stuff has the poofy nature of baby powder and creates a big dust cloud if you have any excess in your hands or if you pour too vigorously. Unlike baby powder it has no scent and a silkier feel. I have never used dry shampoo before and I have never put baby powder in my hair.  I like the cute autumn leaf design on the packaging, it blends nicely into my neutral themed bathroom, but thatis really neither here nor there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not use this for everyday use or &amp;#34;go waterless!&amp;#34; As the package exclaims because it leaves your hair dry and the powder begins to itch after a few hours.  Since the powder is difficult to evenly distribute its possible I used too much.  I vigorously brushed but could not get all the powder out. Keep in mind when you brush out the powder has to fall somewhere too, so on the whole it&#x27;s a bit messy for regular use.  What I like it for is it works great in a punch. I was running late for work the other day and used this instead of a full shower. My trick though to keep it from being too dry or itchy is to add a bit of leave in conditioner to my hair as well. I use Giovanni Eco chic direct leave in.  The first time I used the dry shampoo I didn&#x27;t use a conditioner and boy was my hair greasy the next day, must of been overcompensating for the dryness factor of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark brown and the powder is whiteso it was left looking clean but Matte rather than shine. Which is ok but it also seemed to age me because the white sort of frayed a few areas of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product, a fun novelty, an interesting concept. Kudos for being cruelty free and all that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend for peace corp volunteers, hippies, and new mothers who have no time to shower.</li>
    <li> I have dark hair so it leaves me pretty dusty looking, wish it had a bit better smell to it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to which to compare it; however, it seems to do exactly what I want.  After one day, my scalp starts to get oily, so I apply this product and my style is preserved for another day.  It gives my roots volume, as well.  My hair looks great and I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day.  There are some drawbacks, but not enough to make me stop using it.  I have to apply it without my clothes on because it IS a powder and will get on my clothes, but comes off the clothes easily (I just have to make sure not to miss any or it looks like I have dandruff).  The tube clogs up easily, so I just take the lid off and pour it into my hand.  Lastly, this product does not make my hair &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34;.  It makes it feel course and dry, but like I said, my hair looks great.  If I want my hair soft, I&#x27;ll wash it in the shower before letting my husband run his fingers through it.</li>
    <li> I bought this dry shampoo to use when I am traveling internationally and can&#x27;t wash my hair for a day or two.  My hair is blonde and after a couple of long plane flights, my hair will look stringy, especially around my face and neck.  I used this dry shampoo after my recent trip to freshen up before being picked up.  It worked pretty well.  I think since my hair is light colored it blended in, but might need more work for dark hair.  I just sprinkled some into my hands and then worked it through my hair, then repeated until I was happy with the results.  I am so glad I decided to order this and will always make sure I have it on hand in the future.</li>
    <li> Not very fond of this one. It comes out super fast and makes my hair feel sticky. It does make my hair less oily looking, I just don&#x27;t like the way it feels...at all. I&#x27;ll stick with Oscar Blandi or Alterna Caviar.</li>
    <li> Now, I have only used this product once and it stripped my hair. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a dry shampoo so much to absorb oil between washes, my scalp isn&#x27;t particularly oily. I just wanted something to freshen my hair when I might have been sweating between showers, if that is why you are buying this don&#x27;t bother. However if you have problems with oil, buy. My one recommendation would be very stingy with how much you use until you get use to it, use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I love Acure products and use their shampoo&#x27;s and conditoner&#x27;s as well as their argan oil. This is a huge waste of money though, I hope they don&#x27;t delete this comment as I was surprised to find this trick, buy arrow root powder and cocoa powder...that is for darker hair if you have light hair just use plain arrow root powder. Use an old make up brush and dab it into the mixture...shake off excess and rub around roots or where there is excess oil. Brush hair from roots to tips or blow dry on low. Works wonders.</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars if it did not occasionally puffed out too much powder. Otherwise great, I can go 4 days without washing my hair, without it 2 days.</li>
    <li> this product is awful. It leaves my hair strawlike and tangly.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy.  I love dry shampoos for my super fine oily hair.  The aerosol cans work well but they run out after only a few uses.  This bottle will last a lot longer, plus no yucky chemicals!!  You just sprinkle a little on your hands and work through.  Add more if you need it, but never pour directly on your scalp.  I even use it on clean hair just to add volume.</li>
    <li> Very fast and easy transaction.  The product works good. Unfortunately the spray kind is a little easier to use but I will gladly use this to avoid the chemicals</li>
    <li> Hard to apply without making a mess. The top of this container is very similar to the top of some spice containers- the powder pours out fast.  Once you get the powder into your hair, it gives your hair a strange knotty consistency and makes it hard to brush.  It didn&#x27;t do a very good job absorbing the oil.  I bought this because it was cheaper than other similar products but I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This powder does make your hair LOOK clean, but it does not make it feel clean.  When I use this I can barely run my hands through my hair and it tangles much quicker.  I put this dry shampoo on my hair brush and the part my hair and tap it onto my scalp then brush through, I do this where it looks greasy.  It does take the shine away and it does absorb faster than baby powder (which is what I used before), but my hair feels so gross after.  I will use this up because I don&#x27;t like to be wasteful and will not purchase it again, I will just got back to baby powder.  One thing this WOULD be great for is if you need your hair to have texture for an &amp;#34;up do&amp;#34; or something.  Your hair definitely won&#x27;t fall if you have this stuff in it!</li>
    <li> Works well. Can be messy if not careful. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how people can use this without looking like you had a bucket of baby powder accidentally poured on your hair.  It&#x27;s so white and does not get absorbed at all.</li>
    <li> Before buying this, I used a spray dry shampoo, but I was so tired of the super chemically smell I knew I had to find a powder alternative. I&#x27;ve heard great things about Klorane dry shampoo, but before shelling out the money for it, I looked around to see if there was another powder that was more affordable. I found Acure dry shampoo and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any beauty or hair product, knowing how to apply it is half the battle. This makes it really hard to trust reviews of these products because it&#x27;s hard to know if the product really is bad or the person just doesn&#x27;t know how to use it. That said, using the perforated holes opening, I tip the canister over into my fingertips once and then dump it all straight onto my roots in one spot. Then, like the directions state, I work it into the surrounding hair with my fingertips. I find I get better results doing this than trying to sprinkle the powder over a larger area. I have brown hair and this powder disappears into my hair super fast, leaving it looking clean and without being too heavy or building up. It has no smell, which is fine with me, and I don&#x27;t have to use that much. And I have rather oily hair, so that&#x27;s saying something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure Klorane is great, but I&#x27;m quite happy with Acure and see no reason to pay the extra money. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this a try. I just had to experiment a little bit with different ways to apply it. I used it today on Day 4 hair (dont&#x27; judge!) and it was awesome. Very much recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Difficult to distribute  I won&#x27;t be using it  went back to spray  almost impossible to get even distribute  had to wash hair just to remove</li>
    <li> I am new to the world of dry shampoos, and I don&#x27;t have much to compare to, but this didn&#x27;t work quite like I had expected. I honestly have only used baby powder before, but I actually prefer it over this dry shampoo. This product made my hair feel rough and made it easily tangled. My hair does not get overly greasy (I wash it at least every other day), so I use the baby powder very sparingly on days that I don&#x27;t wash my hair. I used even less of this dry shampoo, and it made my feel somewhat more uncomfortable than before I started. I was thrilled that I found a dry shampoo that is natural and organic, and not aerosol, but am somewhat disappointed with its performance. However, I am not going to give up on it. Perhaps I just need a different application method or something..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it ,,waisting my money.</li>
    <li> Eh.  Shrug.  This is no miracle.  My oily hair is what it is.  I was hoping to only have to wash my hair every other day instead of everyday but this product isn&#x27;t going to encourage me to do that.  The powder shows up white and is noticeable. It&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t mind having to explain to people why it looks like you have baby powder on your head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard quite a lot about the magic that is dry shampoo. While I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d wax so poetic about it as many do, it really does combat any greasiness of 2nd day hair. I have very fine red hair that gets a little shiny after a night&#x27;s sleep. I like the volume I get after sprinkling this product in, but I don&#x27;t like that it turns my hair to straw. It looks great, but feels so so dry. And it seems like I need to use so much that the next day I need to shampoo well to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think as dry shampoos go, this one is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint about this particular product is that there isn&#x27;t any scent---would have loved a little natural eso in it!</li>
    <li> Works well, kind of my first using dry shampoo but I got the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> smell very nice, its organic wich is all that matters for me... even though its a bit har dto distribute</li>
    <li> Do not like this product.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of dry shampoos and I feel like this one really &amp;#34;cruds up&amp;#34; your hair- I have no other way of describing it.  I feels really caked up.  I&#x27;m disappointed because unlike all other dry shampoo this one doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
    <li> This is a great dry shampoo! I bought this because I found that dry shampoo sprays would absorb the oil in my hair upon application, but a couple of hours later the oil would be back. I began using baby powder, but I hate the smell of baby powder with a passion, so that sent me searching for a powder dry shampoo that didn&#x27;t have an offensive smell. I tried Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Pret a Powder, but thought I could find something less expensive that performs just as well. I ordered this and it was all I hoped it would be. It absorbs my hair&#x27;s oil and the oil doesn&#x27;t make a reappearance. It adds great volume. I can take my fingers and push the hair around my crown up with this product in it and the hair will become fuller looking. I wash my hair once a week and this makes my hair look freshly washed everyday. I even use this product on day one hair to add volume. Simply applying this results in more volume than when I use Alterna&#x27;s Bamboo Volume Spray. This is amazing! Definitely give it a try. It&#x27;s price is on point and a bottle will last you forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better... &amp; not a fan of &amp;#34;puffing&amp;#34; the product onto my hair. I use dry shampoo weekly &amp; this just didn&#x27;t make the cut. I will finish the bottle but I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love this. There are better products out there that cost more. I figured I&#x27;d try this since it was cheaper but I don&#x27;t really like the way it feels. It&#x27;s like touching flour which I don&#x27;t enjoy for whatever reason. It also comes out really fast so it&#x27;s hard to control. It does work alright but just isn&#x27;t my favorite product.</li>
    <li> I was sent an unsealed product, and not even the product pictured. Very displeased. Will be getting reimbursed.</li>
    <li> Okay a couple things here... the 1st being that this Co has tons of integrity so the product is not only free of chemicals but it&#x27;s animal cruelty free!!!! Holler. I am NOT exaggerating when I say I can easily go 4 solid days without shampooing because of this product. The trick is to poof the powder on your fingers and then rub both your hands fingers together and go under the scalp and rub the powder where your hair gets the oiliest... which is the scalp. It also looks more natural then dousing it on the top of your head. Then voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!! :D</li>
    <li> Good product! Compact and easy to use.</li>
    <li> as other reviewers have stated, this seems more targeted to blonds and light brunettes.  i have black hair and the white powder definitely shows, but if i work it around for a minute it does disappear.  it would be nice to have a dry shampoo i didn&#x27;t have to fuss with, but this will do in the meantime and it does a great job at sucking up any oil and adding volume.</li>
    <li> works well and no chemicals like many of the other products out there.</li>
    <li> Smells weird. Doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
    <li> Worst dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. The opening to the bottle is hard to figure out and difficult to use. It was also challenging to distribute this product evenly throughout my hair. I used it once. I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> This puts body back into my hair if it becomes limp and you can&#x27;t see it in your hair. I wash my hair every day unless I&#x27;m just going to stay home on the day after. I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> highly recommend! works great. better than any I&#x27;ve used. gives great body and helps extend no-wash days by two or three, seriously.</li>
    <li> I really like this product on my roots, however it makes my hair staticky if it&#x27;s anywhere near the ends.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake when I purchased it. I wanted the regular shampoo,and somehow I hit the wrong buttom. I don&#x27;t like returning things,unless it&#x27;s really necessary,so, I gave it as a gift to a friend.</li>
    <li> Does the job but left my hair feeling terrible. Felt like I had a ton of hairspray in. Just use a very little bit!</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of saving my hair from daily washings, which was damaging and drying out my hair. I liked this dry shampoo because I didn&#x27;t feel like I was putting a bunch of chemicals in my hair and it really took out the greasy look. Made it look really clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Works great. Use it after biking to work. Need &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shampoo after my ride home though</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is lovely. It needs to be applied like baby powder--- over a sink or some other surface to catch the stray powder. It works very well, though not like a generic spray poo. I am happy to apply it with an ounce more effort to save my head from really gross chemicals, like aluminum oxide and propane.&lt;br /&gt;Yay for a good, clean product!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this dry shampoo for achieving the style I want as well as stretching myself a couple of days between washes, especially if I want to wear my hair in a ponytail. It doesn&#x27;t make my scalp feel itchy and uncomfortable like some salon brands I&#x27;ve tried. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is awkward to dispense. I know this probably common with powdered products, but I feel kind of silly when I shake it into my hand and then trying to get it on my head without flopping it in to the sink instead. Or if I try to apply it directly, it leaves my hair looking white. Also when I try to carry it in my purse to use at work, it spills (even when closed). So I would give the container 3 stars, but the product itself 5!</li>
    <li> works wonderfully and lasts for a long time!</li>
    <li> Wow, I guess I am in the minority on my opinion, but I really, really love this stuff!!  Forget the dispenser, unscrew the cap and put about a tsp in your hands.  Then rub the powder between your palms and apply to your roots this way.  I have dark brown hair and I can never see the powder when I use this technique!! I have fine, wavy hair and this gives my hair so much bounce and body.  I apply it, then spray my hair with water, reapply mousse, hairspray, etc, scrunch it and its good to go.  I use this every day that I don&#x27;t wash, which is about 2-3 days in between washes. I guess I could make my own, but this is just so convenient!!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Not the sellers fault, maybe I don&#x27;t really know how to use it???</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to use those nights when I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my hair, it helps with the itch I occasionally get but I don&#x27;t like to use it too much or after not washing my hair for a few nights in a row. It you do use it after a not washing your hair for a few nights it works at first and then it looks like its dandruff.</li>
    <li> Acure is my jam. They really do make a lot of rad products, and this one is no exception. The only thing I keep wondering is... when are they going to make colored versions of this dry shampoo, like Bumble &amp; Bumble does?</li>
    <li> I am so excited to have found this! I hate washing my hair daily, especially in cold weather, but my roots are quite greasy by the second day. I have used cornstarch or baby powder in the past, but the both were difficult to apply even in a shaker bottle with small holes, leaving my dark hair looking very gray in places. I also disliked the presence of talc in the baby powder (not something you want to breathe in). Commercial aerosol dry shampoos, while very effective and easy to use, have horrible ingredients (butane??) and fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy and comfortable with all of the ingredients in this product, and very excited about the packaging. You turn the lid to open the nozzle, then squeeze the bottle itself to deliver a puff of the powder to your scalp without any nasty chemicals. It seems to work just as well as the aerosol products, though some extra brushing may be required as the spray is not as fine. Lots of gentle squeezes to the bottle seem to work better than vigorous squeezing, which will release too much product in one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients do list a couple of essential oils but I am very sensitive to perfumes and can hardly detect them myself. I don&#x27;t think anyone needs to worry about this product causing headaches or such, but this is not the product for you if you are looking for something that is scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is the price--I go through dry shampoo very quickly and I don&#x27;t like the idea of spending this much every few months, but I have yet to see how long this first bottle will last me. I am considering trying to refill it with cornstarch myself, however, before ordering a new one. I will update my review if I think of it!</li>
    <li> not my favorite dry shampoo. hard to control the amount that comes out. left my hair feeling almost straw like</li>
    <li> I can get three additional days between washes after I use this on my hair.  It adds a lot of style-ability and bulk to the hair.  It&#x27;s easy to accidentally use too much, but it brushes out fairly readily.</li>
    <li> I have always had to wash my hair everyday, until now! This dry shampoo makes my second day hair look just as good as the first. The package seems small, but you only have to use a small amount of the product rubbed directly into your scalp to work.No white residue either. I love it.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Does not work at all.  White powder makes my hair look terrible.</li>
    <li> Meh. This did not work for me. I normally use the Fekkai Pronto Powder or the Khlorane spray, but I wanted to see if there was anything else out there that might work better. I normally have had better luck with powders, so I opted to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the product a little tricky to use at first. I always seemed to be dispensing way too much or way too little. And I didn&#x27;t love dispensing into my hands and working into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part was that it didn&#x27;t remedy the oiliness or piecey-ness I was attempting to combat. And that&#x27;s the whole point of dry shampoo for me!  It just seemed to give my hair an even more textured, piece-y look. It would look 35% (or so) better for about 10 minutes after application, then it would just get gross. Very sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have long, straight, fine to medium-textured hair that is normal to oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it seems that you might be able to use it on clean hair to achieve texture, so maybe that&#x27;s a good thing??</li>
    <li> Great Product. I use it as a styling product. I have super-thin hair and mousse and hairspray makes it greasy. This allows my thin hair to have some body so I can put it up without my hair slipping out.</li>
    <li> This is good for spot treatment to absorb oil however I would never use this alone.  I was hoping for something more substantial so that I could go without shampooing every day.  (My hair is very fine and my scalp very oily)  It&#x27;s great after a long day of work for absorbing excess oil to fluff up my hair before going back out, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product but I hate this type of bottle. If given the opportunity, buy the larger. 2.6oz. shaker bottle. It offers more even distribution. This smaller bottle gets air stuck in the bottle and can be a bit frustrating to use. The product, however, is fabulous!!!! Great traveling product if you don&#x27;t need to wash your hair everyday. And it adds texture! :-)</li>
    <li> This is not what I think of when I think of &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34;.  Some people may like it, but it did not work for me.</li>
</ol>
