      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m better off with my cheaper conditioner</li>
      <li>This formula, the Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner isn&#x27;t the best daily conditioner for the most part but it has grown on me.     </li>
      <li>My hair is very soft and smooth and my hair smells great.</li>
      <li>It does smell great but the scent does not last.</li>
      <li>There are many positive reviews</li>
      <li>Rather is smells clean, almost like Ivory soap with a slightly sweet undertone.</li>
      <li>I also appreciate that Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell nutty or extremely sweet.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product for my hair, but may not be right for everyone.</li>
      <li>but I quickly tire of it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has to do with hair texture or not, but mine is far smooth and more managable.</li>
      <li>Sliky smooth, not heavy and no frizz!  </li>
      <li>First the pros.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind those scents at first</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ve been able to find that actually keeps the static electricity out of my hair.</li>
      <li>Every conditioner / Shampoo I have used which had  Moroccan Argan Oil or most other type of oils , always has a nut or over powering sweet smell to it.  </li>
      <li>Not so much.</li>
      <li>I felt this conditioner was too light and not nurishing enough.</li>
      <li>I originally thought I preferred the combination as it not only provided the slippery feel in my hair while showering</li>
      <li>After a month of using the Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner I haven&#x27;t noticed this side effect and my hair feels clean even after multiple uses.     </li>
      <li>I have fair, fine hair and in the freezing temps it goes mad.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not that crazy about Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner but that being said out of the daily conditioners I have used by Organix&#x27;s product lines this is the best one I have tried.  </li>
      <li>Big bottle, smells good, very thick.</li>
      <li>It smells like a soft, perfumy cedar.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t thick and while in my hair it doesn&#x27;t have that slippery feel to it as some conditioners do but does detangle my hair and when I get out of the shower my hair remains tangle free and even soft.     </li>
      <li>By the way I am an african american woman wearing her natural hair 4a/4b.</li>
      <li>very soft when wet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product for fine hair.  Sliky smooth, not heavy and no frizz!  I had this shipped from America to Australia - it is that good!</li>
    <li> I do not agree with any of the bad reviews of this product. I have been using this conditioner with the shampoo and absolutely love it! My hair is very soft and smooth and my hair smells great. I let my condition sit for anywhere from 10-20 minutes on my hair and only wash my hair every 3 or 4 days. I also do not use a towel to dry my hair but instead I use a t-shirt to help it keep the moisture in my hair and have been doing that for over 10 years. I do tend to alternate my shampoos and conidtioners and this makes a big difference also because after a while my hair gets used to whatever products I use and I dont get the same effect.</li>
    <li> First off, I have very thick, coarse auburn hair. This shampoo and conditioner is wonderful to my hair. I don&#x27;t know if it has to do with hair texture or not, but mine is far smooth and more managable. I have not noticed any additional hair loss as some other reviwer mention, but I am keeping a closer eye on that. The smell of this shampoo and conditioner is the best I have ever used. It smells like a soft, perfumy cedar. Absolutely great! As I do not comb or brush my hair when it is wet, I cannot comment on how silky my hair is upon getting out of the shower. I cannot comb my hair when it is wet otherwise I end up with split ends and damage. Fantastic product for my hair, but may not be right for everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not that crazy about Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner but that being said out of the daily conditioners I have used by Organix&#x27;s product lines this is the best one I have tried.  I have used their Tea Tree, Grapefruit Mango Butter and Rejuvenation Cherry Blossom Genseng as well and never cared for any of them.  This formula, the Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner isn&#x27;t the best daily conditioner for the most part but it has grown on me.     The reason is the conditioner is a lot like their other brands. It isn&#x27;t thick and while in my hair it doesn&#x27;t have that slippery feel to it as some conditioners do but does detangle my hair and when I get out of the shower my hair remains tangle free and even soft.     I&#x27;ve written reviews on other conditioners and have read up on ingredients of shampoo and conditioners.  Several conditioners I have tried in the past has silicon in it , this provides the slippery feel to your hair while in the shower but as soon as you step out of the shower the same silicon will cause your hair to tangle worse.     I use another conditioner which has Moroccan Argan Oil in it and it has both the silicon and the Argan oil . I originally thought I preferred the combination as it not only provided the slippery feel in my hair while showering but once out of the shower the Argan oil prevented my hair from re-tangling so no additional leave in conditioner was needed.     However after a while this formula (silicon and oil) builds up and leaves my hair feeling dirty and weighed down.  After a month of using the Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner I haven&#x27;t noticed this side effect and my hair feels clean even after multiple uses.     I also appreciate that Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell nutty or extremely sweet. Rather is smells clean, almost like Ivory soap with a slightly sweet undertone. The scent isn&#x27;t over powering but I can smell the scent in my hair when I hold my hair up close or my husband can and he likes it.     Every conditioner / Shampoo I have used which had  Moroccan Argan Oil or most other type of oils , always has a nut or over powering sweet smell to it.  I don&#x27;t mind those scents at first but I quickly tire of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for what it promised. While it wasn&#x27;t terrible, it was not spectacular. I have thick, dry unamangeable hair that I flat iron daily. I felt this conditioner was too light and not nurishing enough. It does smell great but the scent does not last. Still looking for that amazing life-changing product!</li>
    <li> First the pros. Big bottle, smells good, very thick. Now the cons. For a product called Organix, I expected organic contents. Not so much. My hair fell out after using this conditioner. The product contains \\&quot;cones\\&quot; (dimethicone I think) which I am allergic to. The \\&quot;cones\\&quot; leave your hair shiny, but smother your hair if used regularly. It does leave my hair (what&#x27;s left of it) very soft when wet. There is no moisture when dry. All in all I&#x27;d give this conditioner a negative star if it wasn&#x27;t for the pros. By the way I am an african american woman wearing her natural hair 4a/4b.</li>
    <li> HAIR TYPE: long/thick/wavy/somewhat unruly     PROS: pleasantly fragrant; inexpensive; easy to find in drug store    CONS: the conditioner, plus the oil, did not do anything for my hair as promised by the labels in the front and back of the bottle. My hair was really dry and coarse. I can&#x27;t imagine what the outcome would have been had I solely used the conditioner without the oil. I was so looking forward to using this product but after one try, I immediately returned it. There are many positive reviews and I think that, overall, it works for a lot of women but some, like me, get no benefit from it :(</li>
    <li> Excellent.  As expected.</li>
    <li> terrible, knots, knots, knots!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner I use in the winter when things are horribly dry. It&#x27;s the only brand I&#x27;ve been able to find that actually keeps the static electricity out of my hair. I have fair, fine hair and in the freezing temps it goes mad. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I like that smoothie of my hair.....</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t feel different than any other shampoo</li>
    <li> buy it again and again</li>
    <li> Almost all of the product was spilled out in the the plastic it was wrapped in.  I can send it back but it is an utter mess. I would prefer it be replaced. Sent as a gift. please advise re: return.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel really dry, thought Argan&lt;br /&gt;Oil would help but I&#x27;m better off with my cheaper conditioner</li>
    <li> Worst shampoo ive used... didnt do anything for my hair...</li>
