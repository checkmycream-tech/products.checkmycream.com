<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I did not like this product and am very unhappy with it, I paid about $60 and still cannot get rid of the rash on my face that it gave me</li>
    <li> Heard about this cream from a friend who raved about it.  It lived up to her ravings.  Definitely a great beauty product.</li>
    <li> I love this product ! . I have used it in the past  month.  It is not greasy and keeps my skin moist and soft all day.  I have used other products recommended by dermotologist, but this is by far a better face creme for me.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a non greasy, smooth moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. This product can be compare with Estee Lauder Time Zone lotion or EVEN BETTER. I bought it after some online research.I never hear about this product before. I found in Paula&#x27;s choice and other websites they give a very good rating to this cream.  Then I decided to give it a try not expecting too much and I was soooo surprise. In a couple of days you can see the immediate effects when it comes about skin hydration.  After some time using it skin overall improve. it does tighten your skin, lines less visible and skin very moisturizer. It has a subtle nice fragrance. Lightweight, not sticky, not oily. I don&#x27;t know if it works to improve skin tone nor for people with deep wrinkles. But it worth the try. I&#x27;m surprise how good this cream in comparison with other brands that does not do what they claim and are even more expensive. Well it comes in a small jar, but I don&#x27;t think you need to apply too much neither. I have less than 3 months using it and already and Im convince this is my new face cream. By the way, I use it around the eyes too with very good results. I know Im not supposed to use the same cream for face around the eyes. But I prefer a all in one cream than many bottles. ha ha ha.&lt;br /&gt;The seller sent the package on time as promise and well wrapped.</li>
    <li> I love this!!  You really can tell a difference in your skin after using. I could tell the difference just after a few uses.  I put on half my face the first use just to see if it really did work. You definitely can see results.</li>
    <li> My daughter first sold me this product and I looked it a lot, so I searched for it on line and ordered it.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants fine lines to look as if they have vanished before adding foundation make-up.</li>
    <li> I do not think this is the real product.  I bought some off the BeautiControl site and they feel completely different.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> This product (product line) erases lines, wrinkles, feels good, helps me look good and is natural.  Love it!  I put on after my face is washed well- it stays fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> Gently rub this in and the wrinkles I concentrate on are definitely smoother, even smiling.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is the best for keeping your face moisturized, firm and wrinkle resistant. I also use it on my neck and chest for extra firmness. I would recommend this for anyone who would love to continue to stay looking young. Thank you, Michelle Kane</li>
    <li> I guess I was expecting way too much from this cream, or maybe it&#x27;s just too early to tell.  It moisturizes very well, but that&#x27;s about it so far.  I have only been using this cream for about 10 days.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite BeautiControl product.  I often get compliments about looking younger than I am and this is one reason why.</li>
    <li> I never ordered this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for over a month, and everybody is commenting on how great my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;It really plumps the skin and it is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of creams that are supposed to help the lines, the look of the skin and this is by far the BEST I have ever found. My sister tried it too and was blown away at how she could see the difference in her skin tone, especially in her neck in just ONE DAY. I kid you NOT. We both have spent a fortune on creams, high end creams, and this is Fantastic stuff ladies. GO FOR IT!!!! After using it for a week I went to a party and people thought I&#x27;d had something \\&quot;DONE\\&quot; to my face. They said I GLOWED. I am NOT paid for this endorsement, I am just thrilled....*S*</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not botox in a bottle but I am thinking by my results I would have to use this for over a year to see any drastic results. My pores were smaller after using it, but wasn&#x27;t the result I read I would get. With father time marching across my face I guess I will look into botox</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and it&#x27;s a great product, that&#x27;s why I looked for it again and I got it very quickly and want to thank the sender for getting it to me so quickly.  Great experience all around, thanks Amazon too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks. It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t the first time that I used this product.  I tested it by only applying it to one eye and within minutes there was a noticeable difference</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.  I use it in the morning and a night. At night I do add a little Olive Oil to the creme.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Originally purchased this from a company rep last year and loved the product ... however, I did not love the price. Through Amazon, I purchased 2 for the price that I got the 1 last year! Very happy!</li>
    <li> Really smoothes fine lines nicely. Better than&lt;br /&gt;anything that I have tried. Firms skin too.</li>
    <li> The only issue I had for this product was that the seller took much too long to deliver it. As far as the&lt;br /&gt;product itself it shows a noticeable difference. Try on one half of your face; wait 15 minutes or so&lt;br /&gt;and you can see the improvement.</li>
    <li> Works &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; - scent is a problem for me as I am scent -sensitive</li>
    <li> Great have use it for years people cannot believe my age</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with this face cream, especially for the price.  And...you get a small amount.  I don&#x27;t like that it is NOT a sealed jar.  I was told that BeautiControl does not seal any of it&#x27;s jarred creams.  Not a good thing as far as I am concerned; anybody could have opened it and exposed the cream.  I expect my face cream and makeups to be sealed closed for safety and quality.</li>
