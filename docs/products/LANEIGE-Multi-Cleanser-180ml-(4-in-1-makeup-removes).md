      <li>/&gt;I was about to give up and complain to my mom until I tried one more time.</li>
      <li>At that moment, Laneige Multi Cleanser became my favorite cleanser of all</li>
      <li>My mom bought this cleanser for me after telling me she fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>The best part about this product is that you really only need a pea size to cleanse your face.</li>

      <li>My skin feels very clean after using it.</li>
      <li>It works really well and leaves your face feeling nice and clean :)</li>
      <li>I use it as my nighttime cleanser for my nightly skincare routine, however I use the Oil Free Cleansing Liquid when I get home at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>At night, after a full day of wearing makeup and extremely strong eyeshadow primer, I use about 1.5 amount of product.</li>
      <li>and my skin is smooth and brighter right after I use this product!</li>
      <li>After the wash, my face was smooth and there is a sweet herbal smell to it.</li>
      <li>I love this cleanser so much!</li>
      <li>My face was perfectly clean and even appeared brighter.</li>
      <li>This is such a good product, it removed makeup and cleansed my skin.</li>
      <li>Strong and effective enough to remove waterproof sunscreen and silicone based products.  </li>
      <li>I like the texture of it how it is also a mild exfoliant.</li>
      <li>I am hopeful the bright effect will last longer than right after rinsing.</li>
      <li>Not only does it have a nice scent to it, but it makes your face feel smooth and fresh.</li>
      <li>Koreans, who are obsessed with maintaining good skin, really know how to make a great product.</li>
      <li>After washing with this, it rinses off super easily and my skin feels super squeaky clean but not dry at all.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and cannot use many products on the market</li>
      <li>I really feel like my skin is clean after using this.</li>
      <li>I personally think it smells pleasant; not too strong, but not completely odorless either.</li>
      <li>Usually in the morning, I squeeze about 0.5 inch amount of product, and it works great.</li>
      <li>like this one very much.</li>
      <li>Leaves your face feeling clean and a little goes a long way as it does foam up very good.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is powerful yet gentle.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell and texture, it will last me about 2 months if I use a dime size per day.</li>
      <li>I tend to try out many kinds of facial care products, so if I don&#x27;t end up finding a cleanser that&#x27;s better than this one, I&#x27;ll come back and buy it.</li>
      <li>My face feels clean but not dried out after I wash with this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very through but gentle on my face, and even removes my makeup!</li>
      <li>After I wash my face, it feels super clean and keeps my sensitive skin moderatley clear.  </li>
      <li>I also love how my skin doesn&#x27;t immediately dry out after I use the cleanser.</li>
      <li>: This stuff is a little costly but AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Then, for about 10 seconds, I started gently rubbing my eyelids, the corners of my eyes, and the skin below my eyes.</li>
      <li>but then doesn&#x27;t really want to remove mascara.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to clean your entire face, therefore it lasts at least two months or more if you use it every night.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really picky about facial cleansers, and I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch.</li>
      <li>that I think about it, after having used this cleanser for about two months straight, I haven&#x27;t had any major acne breakouts.</li>
      <li>Removes makeup completely!</li>
      <li>This one washes clearly.</li>
      <li>I have oily, sensitive acne prone skin and this product did not make me breakout nor did it give me any adverse reactions.</li>
      <li>African, have large pores (orange skin type) and facial melasma (about 3 shades darker than body ughh).</li>
      <li>I have really oily skin, but after washing my face, it starts to feel a just a teeny bit dry</li>
      <li>After about fifteen seconds, the cleanser became super soft, gentle, yet thick, a consistency similar to a liquid clay mask.</li>
      <li>The papaya beads are small but strong enough to exfoliate and remove the outermost layer of makeup.</li>
      <li>This time, I rubbed the product into my palms, spread it evenly on my face, and scrubbed (especially around my nose to combat black heads) for about ten full seconds until the papaya beads completely disappeared and blended into the cleanser.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>To spend all this money and not be able to take a simple bottle with me is not good at all.  </li>
      <li>The papaya was too rough on my eyelids, so it didn&#x27;t remove the remaining makeup very well.</li>
      <li>Clearly, this will last for several months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Definitely recommend this product to everyone with various skin types, especially those who have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It removed most of my makeup (moisturizer, BB cream, powder, eyebrow pencil, lipstick) but seriously smudged my eyes (primer, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara), so I ended up looking like a raccoon, and I had to reapply a small amount of the cleanser directly onto my eyelids in an attempt to wash it off.</li>

<li> Not worth the wait</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry if I offend any American or other Western brands and fans of said brands, but Laneige blows them out of the water.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This cleanser is great! My skin is visibly brighter after using it (I&#x27;ve used it for a few months), and I don&#x27;t have much acne while using this. I tend to try out many kinds of facial care products, so if I don&#x27;t end up finding a cleanser that&#x27;s better than this one, I&#x27;ll come back and buy it. Also, my skin&#x27;s so smooth after this!</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser after I have removed my makeup. I like the texture of it how it is also a mild exfoliant. I really feel like my skin is clean after using this. Its a nice product. I dont know if I have seen any noticible results opposed to using another cleanser but it is nice</li>
    <li> Amazing to remove make up!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this and it does by all reports remove every scrap of make up and rinses off easily.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve yet to borrow it to try myself, but she loves it.</li>
    <li> use it a lot of time, nice!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! Anxious to try other products in this line. I was very pleased when i first tried it! GREAT smell too! A little goes quite a long way!!! Would 100 %.recommend!!! Love IT!!!!</li>
    <li> It works very good. Remove make up and smell..&lt;br /&gt;I like this one very much.</li>
    <li> This one washes clearly. And the smell is good and it is very suitable for my skin condition. Great experience.</li>
    <li> While the product may be fine, the cap design is awful.  The cap is so poorly design that a piece of the internal reinforcement came off upon opening the product.  The cap&#x27;s screw design is so loose and the two reinforcement mechanism on the inside are so small, now I can&#x27;t even lock the cap which means it will never travel with me or I may risk it spilling everywhere.  To spend all this money and not be able to take a simple bottle with me is not good at all.  Please redesign the cap!  How can you screw up a simple cap design?</li>
    <li> This is a great great product! I love every mornings and nights when I was my face with this. the best product for any type of skins.</li>
    <li> This cleaner is like the best cleaner for BB cream.  After I wash my face, it feels super clean and keeps my sensitive skin moderatley clear.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to clean your entire face, therefore it lasts at least two months or more if you use it every night.</li>
    <li> My face feels clean but not dried out after I wash with this product. Fewer breakouts. I have sensitive skin and cannot use many products on the market</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser so much! It works really well and leaves your face feeling nice and clean :) That said, I&#x27;d recommend using a toner or moisturizer after using because it tends to dry out your skin a little if you use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;5/5, will definitely order again</li>
    <li> This product is way too harsh, causing deep, patchy reddening of the skin with multiple raised bumps. After use, I looked like I had rosacea. It took a good 30 minutes for my skin to calm after cleansing. I presume this was caused by the exfoliant nature of the papaya. I definitely can&#x27;t use this again and will switch to their oil-free liquid cleanser to see if it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> Removes makeup completely! Love the way my skin feels after using this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Excellent product as all Laneige items.</li>
    <li> Great for ppl with combo/oily skin. My skin feels very clean after using it.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this in Korea this summer and I didn&#x27;t use it til I came back to the states (a few weeks ago)... I wish I tried it sooner!! This is such a good product, it removed makeup and cleansed my skin. After the wash, my face was smooth and there is a sweet herbal smell to it. I definitely recommend this to people who has oily or regular skin.</li>
    <li> smells fantastic, suds up really good...but then doesn&#x27;t really want to remove mascara. Not worth the wait, if you wear a lot of eye makeup (eyeshadow primer, shadow and mascara) you might want to consider something else.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this cleanser for me after telling me she fell in love with it. I didn&#x27;t realize it contained small papaya beads (I&#x27;m not sure what to call them, but it&#x27;s made of papaya) that are supposed to exfoliate, so at first I just rubbed it on my face briefly and rinsed with cold water. It removed most of my makeup (moisturizer, BB cream, powder, eyebrow pencil, lipstick) but seriously smudged my eyes (primer, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara), so I ended up looking like a raccoon, and I had to reapply a small amount of the cleanser directly onto my eyelids in an attempt to wash it off. The papaya was too rough on my eyelids, so it didn&#x27;t remove the remaining makeup very well. I had to rub off the rest with tissue, which is REALLY bad for one&#x27;s skin because it creates wrinkles. Plus, when some of the product got into my eyes, it stung pretty badly (just as getting ANY type of product, soap, etc. into one&#x27;s eyes is painful). Thus, I had a bad first impression.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to give up and complain to my mom until I tried one more time. This time, I rubbed the product into my palms, spread it evenly on my face, and scrubbed (especially around my nose to combat black heads) for about ten full seconds until the papaya beads completely disappeared and blended into the cleanser. After about fifteen seconds, the cleanser became super soft, gentle, yet thick, a consistency similar to a liquid clay mask. Then, for about 10 seconds, I started gently rubbing my eyelids, the corners of my eyes, and the skin below my eyes. Then I rinsed with cold water until all the product was gone and my skin felt squeaky-clean. I looked in the mirror and was amazed to find that all of my tough eye makeup had completely washed away - no gross, black, gunky residue. My face was perfectly clean and even appeared brighter. At that moment, Laneige Multi Cleanser became my favorite cleanser of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully as a two-in-one product. It exfoliates dead skin cellsand the gunk that accumulates in difficult places like the edges of the nostrils, the pores in the sides of the nose, etc. The papaya beads are small but strong enough to exfoliate and remove the outermost layer of makeup. Then, once the beads dissolve, the thickening cleanser works great to remove the remaining makeup, sweat, and oil. I personally think it smells pleasant; not too strong, but not completely odorless either. Usually in the morning, I squeeze about 0.5 inch amount of product, and it works great. At night, after a full day of wearing makeup and extremely strong eyeshadow primer, I use about 1.5 amount of product. Some people complain that it&#x27;s a bit drying on one&#x27;s skin - probably because it exfoliates and cleanses really deeply, but I never experienced any serious drying problems. I have really oily skin, but after washing my face, it starts to feel a just a teeny bit dry so I always put on Aveeno daily moisturizer (in the morning, before I put on makeup) or Iope Brightgen Emulsion toner (at night, before I go to bed). Then I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I think about it, after having used this cleanser for about two months straight, I haven&#x27;t had any major acne breakouts. My skin has not experienced any flaking either. This cleanser is powerful yet gentle. When the cleanser attains a thick consistency (liquid clay mask I was talking about earlier), it literally feels like rubbing clouds on your face. Or velvet. I don&#x27;t even know how to properly describe it, but I find it so relaxing, unlike other crap cleansing products I&#x27;ve borrowed from my friends (like Cetaphil, which is the WORST). I&#x27;m really picky about facial cleansers, and I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch. I&#x27;m sorry if I offend any American or other Western brands and fans of said brands, but Laneige blows them out of the water. Koreans, who are obsessed with maintaining good skin, really know how to make a great product. (Laneige is Korean, if you didn&#x27;t know). It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth the money. I will never again look for another cleanser unless Laneige decides to discontinue this line for whatever CRAZY reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: This stuff is a little costly but AMAZING. Exfoliate, scrub, rinse. Trust me.</li>
    <li> African, have large pores (orange skin type) and facial melasma (about 3 shades darker than body ughh). My goal was to find a skin regiment that would clarify my skin and refine the pores. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 5 days and my facial pores are way smaller and my skin is smooth and brighter right after I use this product! I am hopeful the bright effect will last longer than right after rinsing. I LOVE the smell and texture, it will last me about 2 months if I use a dime size per day. It is a real deep makeup remover, today I wore tomato lipstick and it usually leaves a stain after I wipe it out because of pigments. After massaging my lips with some of the Laneige makeup remover ALL the lipstick was gone so I can only imagine how it dissolves foundation etc. I will buy this again probably 2 weeks before I run out of it since it comes from abroad.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job at cleaning the skin and removing makeup. I have oily, sensitive acne prone skin and this product did not make me breakout nor did it give me any adverse reactions. Leaves your face feeling clean and a little goes a long way as it does foam up very good. Korean cosmetics and skincare are the best way to go! Will repurchase for sure!</li>
    <li> Follow the directions for the best use of it.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Still waiting for the product to arrive and it has been a month since I placed my order. :S</li>
    <li> Strong and effective enough to remove waterproof sunscreen and silicone based products.  A tube lasts a long time, you only need little, about 2cm of the product to wash your entire face.  After washing with this, it rinses off super easily and my skin feels super squeaky clean but not dry at all.  I use it as my nighttime cleanser for my nightly skincare routine, however I use the Oil Free Cleansing Liquid when I get home at the end of the day.  You don&#x27;t need both, but it&#x27;s just my preference to use the two in my skincare lineup.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s very through but gentle on my face, and even removes my makeup! It is superb in diminishing blackheads and keeping any redness/irritation from popping up (I have very fair, sensitive skin). I also love how my skin doesn&#x27;t immediately dry out after I use the cleanser. The best part about this product is that you really only need a pea size to cleanse your face. Clearly, this will last for several months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product to everyone with various skin types, especially those who have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I started using it this week. I must say, it&#x27;s the best cleansing product I have ever used. Not only does it have a nice scent to it, but it makes your face feel smooth and fresh. I would definitely recommend this product to both male and female.</li>
