<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> work great, hold charge well and do not change setting while using. A little small for big hands but all in all a good product....</li>
    <li> Very pleased with performance.  Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer for the money.  Does a really nice job.  Built in adjustable trim length is a large improvement over the older clip on lengh adjustment.</li>
    <li> I am using this product for a month now. It also does not do even shave that quickly, I have to run the trimmer for multiple times to get even trim and my skin becomes rough! When I bought this item, I did not realize that it does not do close shaves,  So whenever I need close shave, I need to resort to other methods.</li>
    <li> Works great at trimming beard to a specific length.  I like how you can have a wide range of length settings without having any accessories to store like you do with clippers.  All you need is the unit itself.</li>
    <li> I use this so I don&#x27;t have to use a blade to shave every few days. I use it on setting 1 for short stubble.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. the perfect trim. battery lasts a good amount of time as well</li>
    <li> I used to have an older model of this line of trimmers that lasted a few years and only had to be replaced due to a short circuit. However, when I compare this with that one, I&#x27;m very happily surprised to see that the trimmer is a lot more comfortable now - I can&#x27;t feel any scratches at all. The trimmer settings are not consistent with the previous model, I generally use a size 3 but on this model that size cuts much shorter. So if you&#x27;re used to a different brand/model, you might need to figure out the correct length for yourself.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for about a year &amp; then is unable to hold a charge despite following charging instructions. It&#x27;s a piece of junk. But you get what you pay for here. Count on it for a year.</li>
    <li> Maybe, its companies trying to save money, but i feel newer devices just don&#x27;t perform as steadily as older devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously used a WAHL trimmers which I bought four years ago. IT WAS THE BEST. Unfortunately, someone stole it and I couldn&#x27;t find another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer has nice features as it is rechargeable and that you can adjust the trim length and how short you want your bears (&amp;#60;- really nice feature).&lt;br /&gt;However, this trimmer does not trim as close as my older trimmer, even at its shortest trim length. HOWEVER, this is not the reason why i gave it three stars.&lt;br /&gt; I gave it three stars because I cut my self four times without realizing it, until i saw the blood. I was trimming my body hair, and as you know the body does not have an straight surface like the face. The trimmer, nicked me several times in areas that were not straight, and left me with blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product, but use it for the face only, and if you use it for the body be very careful.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Really good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is great it does everything well.My only complaint is that with its design of thick to thin makes a little hard to hold sometimes. I have dropped it a few times because of this.But the performance of the trimmer is great...i would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This trimmer has been great. It I have only had it for a short time but I cuts great with not pulling. The adjustable head without having to change attachments for height is great.</li>
    <li> Very nice trimmer, works perfect with or without spacer tip</li>
    <li> High quality!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!</li>
    <li> Thick beards don&#x27;t work to good with this gaurd on...</li>
    <li> I brought this for my husband and he has used it about 10-12 times so far.  It works well and he&#x27;s happy with the trimmer.  But we&#x27;re only giving it a 4 star because he said that sometimes he needs to hold it at a certain angle to get the close shave that he wants.  In that respect his previous trimmer was much more comfortable to use.  But overall this works well and does a good job.</li>
    <li> This little guy does everything I need it to, and with gusto. For simple beard trims every couple of days this is likely all you need. Charges last quite a while, and the length adjustment is built into the device, making your &amp;#34;number&amp;#34; easy to remember.</li>
    <li> I did a good amount of research on trimmers before ordering and I&#x27;m glad I did. I really wanted something to trim my facial hair to a stubble length and I also didn&#x27;t want to break the bank. Found this trimmer and it is awesome!! It has 10 different settings so you can get the right length, although I set mine right at the lowest possible setting and it does a great job. I get the exact look I want from it and it&#x27;s very easy to use. As far as battery life goes, I haven&#x27;t tested it beyond a few minutes at a time, but it has worked on and off the charger just fine. I&#x27;d highly recommend this trimmer especially if you&#x27;re looking for a stubble trim.</li>
    <li> Amazing product trims perfectly I&#x27;ve been using it for weeks now</li>
    <li> works very good great value</li>
    <li> Got it 9/13.  Used it maybe 2-3 times a month.  Worked fairly well.  It quit working a day ago....  Guess why only 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Battery lasts very long! Love this.</li>
    <li> for the price this works well. The clipper head teeth are a little big so this isn&#x27;t great for fine trimming but for a general shaver it works well. The battery takes 10 hours to recharge.</li>
    <li> Keeps the beard nice a trimmed</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price, does exactly what it should and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Good, basic trimmer. Dependable and steady. I can understand the complaint of other reviews that the trim guide is not precise enough for men with full beards or those who want very fine control over the length. I use mine primarily for mustache and side burns; for the cost and convenience, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> it was exactly as described works great, staysn charged for a month for me its all good get it now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Panasonic trimmer and since it was 10 years old, I decided to replace it with this one. This doesn&#x27;t feel as solid and not as ergonomic. I went back to using the panasonic. This works fine, it just feels like a toy and isn&#x27;t as great.</li>
    <li> great if you want to have the perfect stubble!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of all the trimmers i have bought including (Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best things about this trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-10 built-in length settings&lt;br /&gt;-Self-sharpening blades, no oil needed&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t anything horribly wrong with this trimmer. In fact, it does everything it is supposed to. It just doesn&#x27;t do anything well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main gripe is with the beard trimming guard. First, it isn&#x27;t sturdy enough or shaped in the best way to guide your beard hair through the grooves and into the trimmer. When trimming my modest beard, it takes way too long because this thing will just plow over hairs, leaving them uncut. If it happens to catch the hair in the guard, the gaps in the guard teeth are so big that the hairs aren&#x27;t lined up uniformly to be cut. The result is a beard with hairs of varying and non-uniform lengths. To make matters worse, the guard is only connected to the trimmer on one side and is not sturdy enough, so it will bend a little when pressed up against your face causing the trimming height to be slightly different depending on how much pressure you are applying. I trim my beard to about 1 cm or maybe slightly longer, and I use one of the highest available guard settings. If you trim your beard shorter, you may not have the same problems with the guard that I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second biggest problem is that the cutting blades on this trimmer aren&#x27;t very good for trimming very short hairs. Typically, I can use a razor to shave the parts of my face where I don&#x27;t keep a beard. However, in the area around my mustache and mouth, I have to use the trimmer to even up the hairs. Even when the guard is taken off, the blades on this trimmer are just too big to effectively catch and cut the shorter hairs. I have to use a second trimmer with smaller cutting blades to do that work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the good side, the trimmer is priced reasonably, and it hasn&#x27;t broken or malfunctioned in the several months that I have owned it. I haven&#x27;t noticed it pulling hairs when I use it. It also seems to hold a charge for a reasonable length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, the trimmer tends to cut hairs unevenly and it takes a long time to do a decent job trimming your beard. I am not really happy with this trimmer and currently looking to replace it. But using this trimmer has taught me a few things to look for when shopping for a new one.</li>
    <li> So far it fits my needs.  The #1 setting gives me a &amp;#34;1-day stubble&amp;#34; look which is what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer looks cheap with the material and finished used.</li>
    <li> Pros: Length setting locking mechanism, Minimal maintenance, 10 length settings.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Long time to charge fully, No indication of when it&#x27;s done charging, short battery life.</li>
    <li> Excellent beard trimmer and gives a great one day even growth cut if you don&#x27;t have time to fully shave.</li>
    <li> The design of the blade guard on this is horrendously bad. Even when kept on a specific blade setting - the distance between the blades and your face can vary significantly depending on what angle you hold the trimmer at resulting in a completely uneven trim. Used twice and haven&#x27;t touched it since. Don&#x27;t understand how this has so many positive reviews.</li>
    <li> Its good. No problems so far.</li>
    <li> great trimmer...had it for a month and charged once&lt;br /&gt;built in guard is awesome</li>
    <li> very fast delivery. good quality. tnx</li>
    <li> I liked it very much and very easy to use, no issues</li>
    <li> Just came in yesterday, used it today, it&#x27;s trims beard real nice!  So far so good.  P.s. i recommend this trimmer to anyone for the price. Oh I forgot one thing, trimmer i got was already charged up.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does a good job both trimming and shaping.  Cleaning is a breeze. On top of everything, it was not expensive.</li>
    <li> Bought in September of 2014. I only used this about once a week so the initial charge lasted me until today (January 22, 2015). After a full 11 hours on the charger it died within 30 seconds. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Had this for about a year...it had weak power from the start, just to trim my beard would take multiple passes.  The battery, even freshly charged out of the box, wont even last a full trim, and now, 1 year later (after maybe 15 uses) it hardly sustains a charge.  And whoever designed the power circuit on this thing didn&#x27;t do us any favors, because even if you are plugged in, when the battery is drained it will still die on you.  I can now start from a fully charged battery and only get through half my beard (maybe 3-5 minutes) with this thing while plugged in before it dies.  It is now in my trash can.</li>
    <li> Adequate amount of adjustment levels and only one attachment needed</li>
    <li> If your looking for an inexpensive beard trimmer this is it. Sharp trimming blades, a decent battery life, and my favorite feature is the one size retractable trim sizes.</li>
    <li> It must just be that my face is wrong...</li>
    <li> Works extremely well. The height settings are great and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer that is easy to use and creates a perfectly buzzed shave for anyone trying to maintain any style of perfection. I love the 6 different settings that you can choose from that adjust the length of the buzz. When fully charged the battery lasts quite long and I only have to charge it about once every 2 months or so. I only shave about once a month so it definitely works to my benefit. For anyone looking for a simple, easy to use, rechargeable battery operated trimmer that can adjust to 6 different lengths of trimming, then I would strongly recommend this product!  Its precise and easy to use. It is also great for its price. Hope you found this helpful.</li>
    <li> For detail trimming it&#x27;s fine, but when cutting through a winter beard, leave yourself an extra hour. The trimmer guide needs to be taken off repeatedly while trimming to clear trapped clippings. The battery, however, is very good, charges fast and lasts a long time. I think if I were the type to trim daily/weekly it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Works very well; light weight; quick adjustments; easy to clean; relatively quiet</li>
    <li> this is alright. i like the different measurements of this, but wish it could get a little closer. Also, the trimmer is really big on the top, so it&#x27;s hard to get around the mustache since it&#x27;s such a small area, and the top of this is such a wide, big area. If you&#x27;re looking more for something to detail your face and have edges, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is strictly for TRIMMING the whole beard, NOT for detailing edges or anything else. This is also harder to get the top part of the mustache that is right underneath the notrils/nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also is good for the lawn down south</li>
    <li> My husband loves this little amazing machine. Good for the price too</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how good it is, and for a really good price. The battery last for about three weeks, or even more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this about a month and have to say it&#x27;s a poor design. The PRO are has great battery life and power, slick looking, with easy controls. But the CON is the killer as due to it&#x27;s design you can&#x27;t get an even trim no matter the setting. The guard that controls the height/length is a one piece plastic anchored far away from where the blades are and the guard is flimsy and moves. So when you press the clippers on your face and are going along the contours of your face the guard flexes and exposes the blades at different levels that results in a very shaggy shave. I&#x27;ve had other shavers, I think the predecessor to this one that had a column type guard and was very secure and didn&#x27;t have this problem at all. I can only use this without the guard for a really close trim, but I like a little more length. There are lots of positive reviews on here, but I can&#x27;t image why someone would give this 5 stars as who whats a shaggy uneven beard?</li>
    <li> Works really well for me.  Hold charge a long time, I like the removeable and height-adjustable comb.</li>
    <li> Works really nice!  Hubby loves how easy it is to use!</li>
    <li> Great so far.  Use on my face and chest.</li>
    <li> Really a.good trimmer. Can be used as an everyday trimmer. Good quality for the price</li>
    <li> Great for the price, adjusting the height is kind of sticky but im just over analyzing, a good backup or fulltime trimmer for the price</li>
    <li> Trimmed my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Which sucked, because I like my beard.&lt;br /&gt;But if I&#x27;m not going to be biased toward the beard, then yeah this trimmer did a really good job and I&#x27;ve used  it a couple of times since the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;With understandable reluctance.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for only 6 months and already the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge.  For reference I use this weekly, not Daily.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and works as well as $50 buzzers!</li>
    <li> Used it weekly for the past year to trim my beard. Was satisfied with it until the past couple of months. It can no longer hold a charge. $20/year isn&#x27;t bad value but I will look elsewhere for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer for beard.  Light, good size for handling.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Works well for any beard</li>
    <li> This piece of junk arrived in an attractive package, fully protected. When plugged in and charged for 10 hours, it does NOT TURN ON. I have tried to charge again and again to no avail. I would not buy Norelco products ever again.</li>
    <li> Trimmer guard is very flimsy.  Can only cut 3/8&amp;#34; of an inch or shorter; it won&#x27;t work on longer beards.</li>
    <li> For a cheap inexpensive trimmer you can&#x27;t go wrong. I use it to trim down my goatee and I&#x27;ve had much worse for a lot more. I&#x27;ll buy another if and when this one goes down.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old larger and more cumbersome trimmer.  I&#x27;m much happier with this than with the old one.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite trimmer of all time. This trimmer only has ONE clip and you turn the dial on the bottom to adjust the height. This makes life a lot simpler and takes the time consuming task of changing clips away. Its ten hours of battery will last you weeks and weeks. I think I&#x27;ve only had to charge my battery every 2-3 months and it charges pretty quickly as well. The only thing I wish was that clip would allow for longer beard styles. I keep my beard pretty slick but someone who wanted it longer would find that this trimmer is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable Clip&lt;br /&gt;Durable (I&#x27;ve had it for a year now with not problems)&lt;br /&gt;Long Lasting battery life&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy charge&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic Feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable clip doesn&#x27;t facilitate trimming longer beards</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive plastic trimmer. The last one (Discontinued) lasted a year and for the price, that is just fine. This one is a newer model so maybe it will last longer. We are happy with the brand and the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer ONLY IF YOU WANT A SHORT BEARD. The maximum setting is only 10mm, Which just isn&#x27;t that long at all. I wish they sold a 10mm extender for the guard so you could effectively double the length options. With bushy beards being in style these days, 10mm just doesn&#x27;t work. I had to return this and pay double just to get one with a 18mm range. Sad.</li>
    <li> Works very well for the price.  Trimmer is good from 1mm-10mm, which will give you between stubble and a very short beard.  Beard aficionados will need a longer comb, but men looking for a clean scruff or stubble look will do just fine with this one.  Blades remain sharp and have not pinched or yanked yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last terribly long, and you can&#x27;t charge the device while using it.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> Long battery life, different settings and compact system make it very easy to use!</li>
    <li> This has no power and completely stopped working after about 4 months of periodic use.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO THE BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE OR AMAZON AND GET A CORDED WAHL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This went in the trash can.</li>
    <li> Really good trimmer, easy to use, recharges fast.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product... Works as it is stated. My previous trimmer used to give more sound but this trimmer is good....</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. I like a man with facial hair, and he is a good man that caves to my rediculous requests. We are in grad school so sometimes grooming can fall behind...I gave him this bad boy and immediately he rushed in the bathroom to trim up...after a couple of min he was still at it and in my genuine concern I open the bathroom door to see him trimming his junk over the toilet. He got a little ballsie (pun intended) and nicked himself (very minor) because he was using it willy nilly (puns are great.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now don&#x27;t pull hair out of my teeth when I go downtown. Five starts.</li>
    <li> Good razor, but rhe battery does not last long. The charger does not supply enough current to run the razor in a pinch, leaving you high and dry when you need to trim in a hurry on a Monday morning.</li>
    <li> Great reviews for a bad product. Battery lasted 3 months. Now a full charge lasts less than 2 minutes. Claims to not pull beard hair, but the adjustment guard only enhances snagging and pulling of the hair. Great price for a bad product. I am never buying a Norelco product again and I highly advise against this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Love the adjustable guard,  allows you to get your bears just right. Works well without the guard also, for a closer trim. You can remove the blade mechanism just by popping it off with your finger, makes for easy cleaning! Great for those who want to maintain a beard! Charge lasts a long time and it is ready to use shortly after you plug it in after being totally dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much I bought a second for my travel bag!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer ,easy to use and powerful one</li>
    <li> I thought this thing would be okay would I bought it, but it has been less than that.  With the way the blades are setup you have to very carefully go over your face and worry about what direction and the angle of the device.  I&#x27;ve had other beard trimmers where you just turn the thing on and shave..  Simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not with this.  It will also nick you if you press too hard (and I don&#x27;t mean extremely hard) it&#x27;s a very delicate shaver with poor cutting power.  In other words, you need to constantly position it perfectly on your face to get it to cut the right way.  Which makes it a pain to use.  Not worth the $20 at all.</li>
    <li> Good product. Decent price.</li>
    <li> Great deal. I like it. Cheaper than any other place online. Great to be a Prime member.</li>
    <li> Great product.  As advertised.</li>
    <li> Very hard to perfect the beard length. The numbering system makes it easy but because of its design it&#x27;s never the same cut length each time you use it</li>
    <li> I got the product in 3 days instead of scheduled 7. So kudos to a company that sold and delivered the product. In short, the trimmer is great! It&#x27;s light, working great and smoothly. The power cord is detachable with a battery life of about an hour of uninterrupted shaving.</li>
    <li> I used to like it but then my brother used it to shave his pubes and I didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model Norelco beard trimmer whose battery just couldn&#x27;t hold a decent charge any longer. So far this one has kept its charge and works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable guard uses a number dial to select the length. While shaving it stays put and doesn&#x27;t move on its own. The guard is also removable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily and charge it almost weekly.  During the week I haven&#x27;t noticed a decline in power. Charging is easy and the power cable is decently long. The only complaint I have is that I can&#x27;t tell when it&#x27;s finished charging. There isn&#x27;t an indicator light on the unit as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent trimmer overall.  It didn&#x27;t get five stars since it doesn&#x27;t have a charging indicator.</li>
    <li> Great battery life and adjustable length settings. I would recommend this razor. It is also fairly easy to clean, better than my old one at least.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my old AA powered Conair trimmer.  Love that this one doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of attachment to keep up with.  Only negative for me is that there is no fine detail trimmer so I still use the old one for that.  Overall this does cut better and more evenly than my old trimmer.</li>
    <li> I like these, but the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long.</li>
    <li> The plastic piece that moves away from the head to make the height different is very flimsy. I set it to 5 to trim my face hairs and I pressed &amp;#34;too hard&amp;#34; and ended up with a nearly bald face making me look like a child and my dog to bark at me because I looked like a stranger.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using it since Christmas and is very pleased.</li>
    <li> I used this trimmer in the past,that one got broke ,i love this for the price......10 settings to trim...</li>
    <li> My beard looks great and I don&#x27;t have to spend hours making sure my beard is perfectly even</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, battery has decent life and I like the different settings for stubble length. Only issue I have is the plastic part seems a little flimsy. If you push down hard enough it feels like it could break. Also, if you adjust to let&#x27;s say setting #6, if you push down hard enough it could get to a length of a #4 or #5. So be careful if you&#x27;re doing eyebrows or something where a mistake can make you look ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for nearly 6 months and it works very well.  It holds its charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer. I was impressed with how long the battery lasts between charging. I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer over a year now and it always does a great job and makes quick work out of grooming my coarse beard.</li>
    <li> Battery won&#x27;t recharge 1 year after purchase.</li>
    <li> Works fine but was expecting a little longer length option. Keeps beard rather short even on longest setting.</li>
    <li> This is the best little trimmer, I have had a few and the adjustable guard on this trimmer works much better than the separate guards on all of my old trimmers. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> It does the job but doesn&#x27;t get a terribly close shave by itself so you&#x27;ll need to switch to a razor or another trimmer for that.</li>
    <li> Does the job and for a cheap price and is rechargeable (battery costs add up!) Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a  cost-effective solution.</li>
    <li> I really like my Norelco QT4000 beard trimmer. It seems to be very well built. Holds a charge forever. And I mean forever. I&#x27;ve owned it now for around a year and only had to charge it a couple of times. I like how the adjustable length part is build in, unlike my previous beard trimmer where it was separate pieces. It is easy to clean and travels well. The fact that it is wireless is really great too. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! Easy to use, easy to adjust, long battery-charge life and easy to recharge. GREAT.</li>
    <li> cheap, and worth the price, but the teeth cut me, not the blades, the teeth. NEVER had this happen with ANY razor before.</li>
    <li> Works great price is very good about $10 less than Walmart and ships fast</li>
    <li> A simple product my son recommended for beard trimming. Numerous settings from stubble to beard. Charge lasts well. Nice product. I use it to trim a 3-5 day growth before shaving.</li>
    <li> Good price for this beard trimmer. First time I used it, it worked really well. The only con would be that the material is made of is not as firm as other trimmers, it&#x27;s kinda light. Recommendable.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  Easy to use and light.</li>
    <li> The razor is tough to clean the blades the way the guard is set up.  Otherwise a capable trimmer that works well.</li>
    <li> I wanted a stubble trimmer and this was perfect.  I&#x27;m not a super burly guy, and I wanted to keep the stubble very short; this did the job.  I was surprised just how close you can shave stubble with this trimmer.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I really like it, easy to take with you, extend battery live, let&#x27;s see how it works on the next months.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this bear trimmer is that there is only one attachment. I hated fumbling through several different attachments to find the right length with my old trimmer. The attachment very easily adjust by spinning the dial with your thumb. You can get a very close shave with the attachment on. If you would like to get even closer all you have to do is pop the attachment off and the blades will be exposed for the closest shave possible. It is easy to maneuver and feels comfortable in my hand. The charge lasts me two weeks or so but I only use it every other day. I would consider this trimmer to be somewhat stylish and not a complete eye sore if left out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like about this trimmer is that it is difficult to clean. The length attachment as well as the blades easily snap off for rinsing. However, you cannot rinse the main part of the trimmer for getting the little hairs out of the inside around the motor is difficult. I usually just remove the attachments and blow it out and call it good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend buying this trimmer.</li>
    <li> works great #1 setting could cut closer.</li>
    <li> Works we&#x27;ll as a beard trimmer and is relatively quiet. Serves the purpose as expected. Arrived on time and was well packaged.</li>
    <li> Great product in a small package but a mighty work horse love it was really impressed with it highly recommend super transaction.</li>
    <li> awesome function, esecily reasonable price!</li>
    <li> This is a great every day use beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy and comfortable to used and to clean.&lt;br /&gt;it has great long battery quality.</li>
    <li> Pretty good trimmer. Won&#x27;t give you a close shave, fails to get rid of all the finer hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is pretty good. I only charge it once in a long time. Haven&#x27;t managed to cut myself with it.</li>
    <li> For the Price I was getting this thing for I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be great quality. I was surprised when I opened it and messed around with it. I was impressed with the amount of settings in the ease-of-use of this trimmer. I have only used it a couple of times but I am very happy with this product and I highly recommend it to anybody else looking for an inexpensive trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always shipping was incredibly quick with Amazon prime</li>
    <li> works good then it wont take a charge.</li>
    <li> Conch kvmvgmk jjvcggm</li>
    <li> This is a great beard trimmer and has an exceptionally long battery life.  Great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I had bought one at Target for way more than I bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Points that I was looking for and has fulfilled:&lt;br /&gt;-Good battery life, I haven&#x27;t had it die on me while shaving which is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;-the different measurements for trimming are built Right into the razor. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Nice even cut so far.  I have used this for about a month or so and it seems to cut my beard quite evenly.</li>
    <li> gets your beard all cleaned up and nice like. the glides feel pretty sturdy, better than my last norelco beard trimmer. I wish the charging light was on the trimmer and not the plug though....</li>
    <li> Great clippers. The adjustments are great for short beards, and the battery lasts quite a while. A huge unintended bonus for me: I buzz my head hair using clippers with no guard. I&#x27;ve always used corded clippers which are heavy and cumbersome. I found out that if I remove the length guide on these clippers and use the bare blades, they turn into awesome head buzzers! I don&#x27;t want to be bald like with a Bic razor, but I want just a little stubble to show, and these clippers cut close and very quickly,saving me a lot of time and hassle compared to my old corded clippers. I love this product, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> If you are paying this much for a beard trimmer, you aren&#x27;t aiming to revolutionize your morning ritual. I set it to 8 and it makes my goatee a good length. A lot of people claim the maximum length is too short, but if you are going for a goatee or goatee length hair, 8 to 10 is perfect. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for any more rugged beards, though. It seemed to always find new hairs to cut no matter how many times I passed it through my beard, but the end result was satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is perfect.  Lighter and more portable than my old one.  It shaves really close.  I only need to trim once a week now!</li>
    <li> IMPORTANT: The numbers settings they have are NOT the same as standard clip lengths. Start on a high setting and work your way down. The first time I used it I naively set it to my normal clip number and trimmed shorter than I wanted. Once you get past that, it&#x27;s a decent trimmer. Certainly the best for this price range. Just don&#x27;t expect a barber quality trim.</li>
    <li> Send me anorher blade. I am wearing the only one I have out. lol Thanx a link to a blade purchase will do</li>
    <li> Much better than some i have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> No complaints at all. Holds a charge well. The adjustments work well. Thanks Norelco!</li>
    <li> It works great and I keep a short beard all the time.</li>
    <li> My husband was really surprised when he opened this gift up for Christmas and found out what it was!  He needed one and I was hoping he would like it and he definitely did! Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest - I don&#x27;t use this for my beard.  It is great for the rest of me though.  The fact that it is adjustable and battery operated makes is super simple and easy to use.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier for the price.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best trimmer I have ever had.  Easy to adjust and easy to replace the blades when the time comes.  Way to go Norelco !</li>
    <li> I liked when it worked but too short of a life.</li>
    <li> Its amazing m so happy with service and product.</li>
    <li> Simple and easy. Trims evenly and precise. Easy to clean, non-clogging. Less expensive than buying a replacement trim head for my previous trimmer. Good design and comfortable to use.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome buy. Works perfect for what I need</li>
    <li> Hubby grew his whiskers for no shave November, that turned into a Decembeard. He looks quite cuddly with the beard so he got this to maintain his dashing facial hair. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty short beard. I use a #2 setting out of 10. I love that the adjuster is built in, rather than snapping on different attachments that always break. I have a graveyard of old beard trimmers like that. Hopefully the adjuster holds up. I am a little concerned that there is no release button for this &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; attachment and you just pull it out and snap it back in, but for $15, I don&#x27;t really care. Catches the whiskers within the attachment (which is the only reason you need to detach it...basically after every trim), but it helps keep the bathroom clean. When you pull off the adjuster, you can also use it for fine tuning. Very nice.</li>
    <li> For the price I am very happy with this beard trimmer.  Powerful enough for everything but the hair on your head.</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer for my father. Last one I bought lasted three years. Great quality at great price.</li>
    <li> Was great for a few months, and now the battery wont hold a charge. Now I have to charge it immediately before use. Spend the extra money for something more durable.</li>
    <li> battery died after 2 years</li>
    <li> great beard trimmer love the packaging and the measurement settings to trim the blade guard is pretty well build and a great trimmer</li>
    <li> I used it on my facial hair as well as my chest and abdomen it does as it says no complaints</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t the  job!&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> Does a great job for quickly shaving off the bulk of your beard. Doesn&#x27;t trim too close though, so you wont get a perfect shave from this thing like you may with other electric shavers. It is much more for volume reduction than anything else. That said, it does a great job and holds a charge for quite some time.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace a Remington that had a broken comb/head piece. This unit works great and will be a fantastic replacement. I like that I can remove the comb/length attachment and use just the blades. The blades are rounded and should not cut into your skin unless you have a weird angle or push into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cuts very evenly&lt;br /&gt;Lots of length settings&lt;br /&gt;Comb is removable/cleanable&lt;br /&gt;Can be used without comb/adjuster&lt;br /&gt;Battery seems to last a couple weeks with short daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The shortest comb setting is not that short.&lt;br /&gt;Without the comb attachment (using just the cutting blades) it&#x27;s not as short as others.</li>
    <li> Good standard beard trimmer.  Gets the job done with minimal hair pulling.  Seems to hold a charge well.  I&#x27;ve used it daily for the past few months and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Philips trimmer. I like my beard to be short but not just a shadow, so I set the trimmer at 3 and it is totally consistent from trim to trim. A snap to clean, just rinse the comb and clipper and blow any loose hairs out of the trimmer cavity. And, the battery holds its charge for weeks.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Works great as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, I for $16 it did the job well. I opened the package up and it took a bit to learn how it worked. It is adjustable and I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the trim I did. I wanted this trimmer because I enjoy having a beard, but hate when it gets too long. This should keep the mane under control.</li>
    <li> GREAT TRIM, GOOD BATERY LIFE, EASY TO USE.</li>
    <li> this trimmer is a little smaller than my old one . but it works just fine . good price and fast delivery . i only use it to trim my mustache and it does a good job . plenty of settings to explore.</li>
    <li> It works really good for him.</li>
    <li> This product is &amp;#34;skin friendly&amp;#34; which basically means the comb has rounded front edges that allow the trimmer to smoothly glide over your face. This may sound nice but I find it often results in the comb smashing down the hairs and pinning them to my face preventing them from going up into the trimmer blade. As a result it often requires multiple passes to cut some hairs, especially ones that might not want to stand up straight on their own. It now makes sense to me why most trimmers have pointy wedge shaped comb teeth. It&#x27;s so the point will come in from below the hair followed by the wedge and help stand it up. The comb on this trimmer seems to do the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very sensitive skin this would probably be a good trimmer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have regular skin, You might get frustrated with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes time for me to buy a new trimmer, I will be purchasing one with the pointy teeth and hope it works better.</li>
    <li> The way the guard is designed if your hair is longer than 1/2&amp;#34; it just jumps over it</li>
    <li> This trimmer holds a charge for weeks on end. So far I&#x27;ve only had to charge it around 3 times. It&#x27;s easy to clean and has done a great job keeping my beard short and even.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it. I did. The idea of the adjustable guard seems so smart. But goddamnit this thing kinda sucks. What the F, Norelco? I have to friggin shove this thing into my face with a butt ton of pressure to make it trim anything. And I mean, I&#x27;ll have this thing on the 3mm setting, when my beard is a solid 8mm long, and it can&#x27;t cut squat unless I really push in uncomfortably into my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of it sucking at that, when I take off the guard and try to get a close trim on parts of my neck of cheek, it&#x27;s nowhere near close. I&#x27;ve actually gone back to the old trimmer I was trying to replace and am on the hunt for something else now.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one perk I will say is that it in no way has choked up on my thick bear. It cuts right through it. Though I&#x27;ve been too scared to use it unplugged because it only has a listed battery life of 30 minutes. A half hour. Thats like 3 trims... so for more than a long weekend you&#x27;d have to take the charger... Ugh... First world problems.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, does the job perfectly and no performance issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is another added plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 - product for the price and performance</li>
    <li> I bought another brand trimmer off the shelf at CVS, which broke less than 5 minutes into a light trim. This trimmer, cost the same, and so far has been great. The 10 customizable settings are great, it has a nice clean cut, and never jammed. I&#x27;m testing out a beard so I didn&#x27;t want to go all out on an expensive trimmer, but this one works great for the price.</li>
    <li> Worked well, but only for 6 months when charging failed.  Failure probably due to cord but cost of new cord is more than 50% of product price so I&#x27;m better off going with new product.</li>
    <li> Does the job and is a much better product than competition, especially Wahls, which I bought to my regret. The adjustable head and non-snagging jaws are what makes this a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> It works great for me. Especially since I&#x27;m in a college dorm, this has come in handy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several trimmers over the years and i love the fact that this one has the convenience of a dial setting for the cutting length. No longer have to change guides.</li>
    <li> Great - does what it says. Hit buy now save yourself time/money!</li>
    <li> Gets close when the cap comes off and lots of levels makes it nice for a variety of lengths</li>
    <li> Too many times do i need to pass the same hairs.  My old Norelco trimmer took half as long and felt like it was a more durable trimmer.  It does the job, but there are better options.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product. It is really awesome. Works as advertised and would suggest anyone who is looking for a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> Great quality. The battery last enough.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great in every way. 100% recommended !!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in January and used it as directed approximately three times.  Today, the motor slowed and finally stopped while I was using it, and the trimmer is no longer able to pick up enough speed to actually work.</li>
    <li> favorite cheap beard trimmer that I have owned in my pathetic beard existence.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product for it&#x27;s price. Not the best beard trimmer, as it may require several repetitions to properly trim the beard, but it&#x27;s very portable, lightweight, and easy to use and maintain.</li>
    <li> Does the job without any funny business. Came charged right out of the box. This trimmer is good and still relatively cheap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this beard trimmer for less than a year. I charged it fully the first time I used it, as per the instructions, but after about three charges it stopped working, and now the return window is closed. Thanks a lot. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer, especially for the price. Gives a smooth and even trim. It definitely meet my expectations for the product.</li>
    <li> These might just be good trimmers for the majority of people but unfortunately don&#x27;t work too well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will first start with the positives.  I found the item to be well constructed and felt comfortable and well balanced in my hand. The adjustment of the guide was very easy to use and very convenient.  The guard is very comfortable and easy on the skin as it does glide over your skin more than others.  It is very easy to pull the guard and blade off of the trimmer to clean it out and make sure the nasty build up of hair inside the unit itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: My beard could be considered thicker or more coarse than others but I found that the trimmer just didn&#x27;t lift the hair away from my face enough to get all of the hairs trimmed.  So I would spend longer than I used to spend trimming my beard but after I was done I would still have many places where several hairs did not get trimmed at all.  I tried going over the same spot from every possible direction, quickly and slowly, nothing worked.  It simply would not lift some of the hairs from my face to trim them all,  leaving several obvious spots that were missed and a few spots where it wasn&#x27;t obvious to others, but I noticed myself when I looked closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not a bad trimmer, it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I will stick to my other method (using a Wahl Peanut with a 1 guard).</li>
    <li> In the box your receive the trimmer, a guide for it, a tiny comb-thing for cleaning, and a power cord. The power cord has a little light on it. The trimmer has a huge power on and off button, and is ergonomic and able to be held easily.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good trimmer especially for the price. It has a option with the guide on to adjust it to ten separate lengths in 1 milometer increments (I will explain below), and I suppose removing the guide yields a 11th length.&lt;br /&gt;It is reasonable easy to clean you can remove the guide, then actually open up the blade to clean out any hair that has gotten on the inside.&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for a few weeks and with light use have not had to recharge it yet, so I believe the battery lasts near an hour is accurate.&lt;br /&gt;The one slight downside I would like to add is if cutting hair that is longer their maybe a slight pulling of the hair, of course this could possibly be prevented by cutting down in smaller increments as opposed to going from alot to a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok many had questions regarding what the lengths were, the trimmer goes up in 1mm increments, and the largest length is actual 13/32\\&quot; as opposed to the misprinted 13/64\\&quot;. This was throwing alot of potential buyers off. So basically this trimmer almost goes up to a half inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is a great value for the money, and if you have a beard that isn&#x27;t too magnificently big, then i would definitely recommend this for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it works pretty well, wanted something to maintain a good length on my beard, and so far it works great. Like the fact that it has multiple lengths.</li>
    <li> Not really good, is okay, but i was expecting more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to better describe the title in few words - my old trimmer would catch some of my hair and pull them if I moved the machine about my face too faster. This one I can quick run over my skin and there aren&#x27;t any painful surprised.</li>
    <li> To begin, I don&#x27;t really know how many stars to give this since my dissatisfaction with it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with how well it works (hence, three stars). My problem with it is that I tend to grow my mustache and beard a tad long and it was only after setting this trimmer to the longest setting and seeing it trim my beard rather drastically short, for my tastes, that I realized this trimmer wasn&#x27;t for me. Now, in all fairness, I could have read the description of the length you can trim for more carefully and realized it wouldn&#x27;t allow me to trim my beard and mustache to the length I like. But I&#x27;ve owned two trimmers before this one and both of them accommodated my preferred length and then some. So I just didn&#x27;t expect to have this problem. So, pretty good trimmer functionally (at least, as far as I can tell from using it once). But if you keep your beard/mustache a tad longer than most do, it&#x27;s probably not the one you want.</li>
    <li> As a dude, I try to keep my bathroom gear to a minimum.  My roommate has a beard trimmer with like 8 different attachments and he keeps it in the original packaging so as not to lose anything. It fills half a cabinet in the bathroom and spills everywhere if you try to move it.  I really appreciate the all-one-piece adjustable length design of this trimmer.  The adjustable plastic guide and the actual trimmer blade are also very easily removed for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, it trims my beard pretty well too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product is really good, or my old trimmer really sucked.  Either way, this product works very well.  It is very light weight and easy to use/clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two minor complaints:  If you have a thick beard, you&#x27;ll need to remove the trim guard every few passes due to hair getting trapped in there.  It&#x27;s easy to remove and clean out the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch is very low on the product and makes it awkward to handle with only one hand when you stop to clean out the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for the price and I would recommend this to anyone who needs to do some manscaping.</li>
    <li> The greatest part of this trimmer is I only have to dial the length instead of changing heads.  It&#x27;s durable , easy to clean and was very affordable...thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the beard trimmer since I bought it.  It is much better then my old one (old a norleco)  especially the guide on the makes gliding on my beard very smooth.</li>
    <li> Stopped using a traditional blade razor for the Norelco,  couldn&#x27;t be happier. Holds a long charge and is great for daily use.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to realize that the blade guard will detach for detail trimming.  Once i figured that out, i really liked them. Use in the shower without problems.</li>
    <li> Still working good 18mos later</li>
    <li> great gift men love them</li>
    <li> Did not last for more than 2 months! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works good. Simple cutter. Dies after 3 trims. Only downfall but just plug it in and recharge.</li>
    <li> Battery is great lasts a long time .</li>
    <li> I purchased the QT4000 in January 2014.  Upon receipt, I charged it according to the product instructions.  I used the trimmer for a little over a month, trimming my beard once a week or so, until it needed another charge.  I attempted to charge the trimmer as I had done the first time, however, the trimmer failed to charge.&lt;br /&gt;When it did function, the results were so-so at best.  It doesn&#x27;t trim the hair evenly, and I&#x27;m not overly fond of the attached comb.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is, don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this low end trimmer.  I&#x27;m not suggesting that all Philips Norelco beard trimmers are created equal, just that this is the low end of their product line, and once again, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 1 star because Philips Norelco will be sending me a replacment trimmer in ten (10) business days.  That&#x27;s a long time for the pony express to arrive if you ask me, but at least they promised to replace it.  If I decide to keep my beard, I may invest in a more sturdy trimmer that&#x27;ll last a few years, not 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to do.im pleased with it.i dont think anybody would be disappointed with this beard trimmer</li>
    <li> It cuts well enough and holds a charge decently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There does seem to be one major problem, unfortunately. The way the adjuster works is you spin the blue nob which causes the guide at the end of the trimmer to extend or retract. This works flawlessly, but the problem is once you extend the guide a few notches out it will start to bend when pressing against your face. If you set it to 10, the farthest it goes, pressing the trimmer against your face with even a tiny bit of force will cause the guide to bend. When it bends the trimmer gets a little closer than you want, so what should have been a 10 ends up as a 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For under $20 it&#x27;s still a good deal, you get what you pay for. It wouldn&#x27;t be very good for long beards, but if you just need to maintain a short beard/goatee it will work fine.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and on time. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect for $20 but it was a good brand name and I hate having a ton of extra attachments laying around so it was a good choice for me. When I first unpackaged it my impression was that it was cheap and low-quality but as I started to use it I quickly became happy with the smooth plastic guard it has over its teeth. I shaved my face and head on a middle setting then on a low setting and even when I felt it start to grab my hair when I went too quick, it didn&#x27;t pull and shaved with ease. I don&#x27;t know if it was fully charged when I got it, but left it on the charged for about an hr before I used it for 35 min and it lasted just fine. It&#x27;s asy to clean via the removable blade guard. Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> This clipper cuts does not cut well at all for a goatee. It is very choppy and has an awkward head angle. I bought this item for home use, however I am a barber by profession  and I can tell you that you are much better off buying a regular clipper with size attachments than you are with these. They are very lightweight and feel cheaply built.</li>
    <li> The primary reason I bought this is because it was cheaper than buying a new charger for the other Norelco trimmer I have (Norelco G370).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. If you are using this only for beard trimming and do not need interchangeable guards and features, this is well worth the $18. The guard numbers are accurate and the wheel is a bit strange but easy to use. The guard itself comes off easily, as well as the blade head for easy cleaning. It also seems to not get quite as clogged up as the G370.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off slide is a bit strange, and I have accidentally turned it on/off once or twice, but overall not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The QT 4000 charges quickly, and is useable while plugged in, which is not always the case. The charger block is also sideways rather than a large downward block, which is great for crowded bathroom outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the few weeks I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;m so far pretty impressed, and would buy again if necessary. If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer only the QT 4000 is great, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with a few more applications, check out the (more expensive) G370.</li>
    <li> nice adjustment levels.  holds a charge for a long time.  does the job!</li>
    <li> Works great, but I bought it for a rebellious teen who now refuses to trim his beard.... Used once in 2 years!!!!!</li>
    <li> Smooth design, easy to hold and use, does great job in trimming beard.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very easy to use.  It is a great value for the price.  It is very convent and portable.</li>
    <li> The product is pretty good. I wish it had more attachments like a detailed trimmer and a foil shaver but it not meant for such usage I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strength is okay; however don&#x27;t expect this to be nearly as strong as your barbers trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is pretty good....I am happy Thank God for everything... :)</li>
    <li> I had an el cheapo trimmer, and it worked every bit as good as this one.  If you set the guard, but your not consistent with the angle of the trimmer, you&#x27;ll trim unevenly.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable, but that&#x27;s about the only discernible improvement over the one i paid $8 for at TJ Maxx.  For the money it just doesn&#x27;t seem to add any value.</li>
    <li> This was a great trimmer for 9 months. the blades never dulled, the length settings were perfect, easy to hold and maneuver across my face. but I woke up one day went to trim my beard and all of a sudden it died quickly. I let it charge went to try again and quickly did the same thing. I decided to let it charge again only to discover that apparently the battery is done for this trimmer. I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because the all around use was great for 9 months but I did expect more from the battery even though 9 months would be considered good use.</li>
    <li> Not bad quality could be better but for the price its the best one you will get</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Perfect length for the stubble look. I use it just about every other day and love the results.</li>
    <li> Battery life was garbage. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Worked well for about a year. Battery is now so degraded that I can&#x27;t shave fully even while it&#x27;s plugged in. Good value for the price, however.</li>
    <li> Definitely the cheaper of the two models.</li>
    <li> Started off real well but after a couple of months it seems to have diminished its cutting capability. Not a bust for the price though.</li>
    <li> HATE trimming no good at it but the trimmer is great!</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer.  Works well.</li>
    <li> Not sure why some people are whining about this model. I have a thick beard with very coarse hair. This model works much better than my last Norelco.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works just as advertised.  Easily worth the money</li>
    <li> We bought this for Phillips Norelco QT4000/42 for our daughter&#x27;s boyfriend for Christmas. It&#x27;s a great little shaver at a great price. I did a lot of research before I bought one because he gets pretty scraggly before shaving, and I wanted to be sure to get him something that could handle his growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He tried this out right after Christmas and it did a great job. Then, as usual he let his whiskers grow out again before trimming, but each time the QT 4000 has come back and taken him to task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this highly for anyone who wants a razor at a good price point that can handle some pretty heavy duty growth.</li>
    <li> This little marvel lasted all of two months before the motor died. I cleaned it, took care with it and it still died. Never again Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> I like this adjustable trimmer. No changing heads to change beard length, just turn the dial. Makes it easy to achieve any beard length that you want. Pull off the plastic comb head, and you can trim the beard edges to keep it neat. Keeps sideburns neat too. Charges last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several weeks now. I&#x27;ve used it for several hair removal procedures and it is working great. Unlike my last Wahl, there has been NO snagging of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty easy to keep things even: I use 5 on my beard near the sideburns, transition to 7 and then go to 10 for the chin.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this trimmer. It is very carefully designed, looks simple, no complications, easy to carry around for travel. Works perfectly and is of high quality, worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product. On the lowest setting, it leaves just stubble, and works very well on beards too. Well made and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very handy for keeping beard at desired length.  Easy to clean, easy to adjust.  Does the job with no fuss.  Can&#x27;t find any downside.</li>
    <li> For The Money, The Philips Norelco QT4000/42 Beard Trimmer Has Far And Above Exceeded My Expectations. When Fully Charged, This Device Has Great Trimming Power, Easy Adjustable Settings, And A Breeze To Clean. I Have A Fairly Thick Beard, And It Zipped Through It With Ease!!! For Under $20.00, An Amazing Value!! Well Made And Durable. I Highly Recommend This Product!!!!</li>
    <li> Finally a simple, rechargeable and easy to use electric trimmer. The guard is very easy to adjust and stays where you set it. It is also very easy to remove. I have yet to have any tugging issues with this trimmer and it cuts well. It is also comfortable to use without the guard on bare skin.</li>
    <li> Works great and did exactly what I needed it to do.  Was able to trim my beard easily and the razor was an easy clean up.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what you&#x27;d hope it would, and does it at a great price! I&#x27;m now the owner of a well trimmed Level 3 beard.</li>
    <li> Soooo, I don&#x27;t have a beard!  BUT i wanted to try this out for weed wacking the rest of my body.  Didn&#x27;t work unfortuntaly. Nicked myself several times and the plastic guard is kind of cheap.  May be great for a beard but not good on the body.  I returned it and bought the old school buzzer clipper set up.</li>
    <li> Works well, held up well traveling, battery holds charge very well between infrequent trips.</li>
    <li> This has been a perfect item for the price that I paid.  I could have spent a lot more, since I have not bought an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; version of this, I cant say its better, worse or equal.  I can only say that I cant imagine what an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; one would do any different, when I&#x27;m done using this item, my beard is smaller than it was before I started.  For the price, this is a great item.</li>
    <li> I needed a trimmer for being a lazy, cheap bastard.  I let it grow for 2 weeks, and shave it down to with the #2 setting (1/8&amp;#34; I think) and I look fresh as a daisy.  Holds a great charge, cuts very evenly, and is surprisingly great quality!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I see other for a lot more.  But this little baby is well worth the price.  I love it and it stays charged for days!</li>
    <li> I used it couple of times already, so far it works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and never ending battery life.&lt;br /&gt;works perfect with 220V.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I was looking for. An easy to use trimmer with variable lengths. Very happy with the product so far.</li>
    <li> I seems well built. The guide could be a little more sturdy, but I like it much better than my previous one.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a few months and it performs as it should.  I have no complaints and would recommend it to anyone looking for a product in this category.</li>
    <li> okay , hard to shave body though good for face.</li>
    <li> Trims my beard well no matter how long it is. It works!</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer works great for me and I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price.  I like the fact that I can just set the length I want with the blue dial.  It is also easy to clean and it has been going about  two weeks between charges.  It would be nice if it had a stand, but that&#x27;s a minor thing to me.  It&#x27;s not advertised to be used for cutting the hair on your head, but it works for me.  I just keep my hair cut super short.</li>
    <li> Amazing product that has made keeping a trimmed beard so much easier. The adjustment of the hair length is easy and simple.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband after his old Remington beard trimmer clip broke. Despite all the wonderful reviews, I was a little worried hubby might not like it, after all I don&#x27;t grow a beard and know nothing about beard trimmers. He tried it as soon as it arrived and practically hopped out of the bathroom all gleaming and telling me how he wished he had known of this thing four years ago (that&#x27;s how long he had been &amp;#34;suffering&amp;#34; using the Remington; according to him the two products are like day and night). I also noted that his goatee looked a lot &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; after he trimmed it with this product, compared to how it looked after using the Remington (not that it looked bad before, just much more sleek and stylish now). It is also very reasonably priced and seems very well made (in comparison to the cheaply made Remington). I am thankful to all of the reviewers for taking the time to write about their experience with this product, which helped me pick this trimmer. Happy hubby &#x3D; happy me! :o)</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband who just needed to trim up an out of control beard. This trimmer worked great! The quality is great and the price is even better!</li>
    <li> The build quality and ease of use on this trimmer is fantastic. It&#x27;s a one-trick-pony as it will do your beard and make those necklines as straight as you desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one gripe is that even on the highest setting, this is a very short trimmer. Measure the cutting range for this trimmer on your own before purchasing. If you find that the highest setting, 10, is too short for your beard length (which is the case for me), then you may want to look at another trimmer.</li>
    <li> really good, and for the price great</li>
    <li> Stylish trimmer, easy to use trimmer for beard, eye brow and even ears, love that you can change the length without having to change parts.</li>
    <li> This device effectively and uniformly terminates all the filamentous biomaterial that grows from follicles in the dermis of my face.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this! He&#x27;s had expensive professional ones and said this is the best he&#x27;s had so far. Especially for the price.</li>
    <li> For the price, this thing does exactly what I need it to do. I don&#x27;t like to use razors and like to keep a little bit of stubble, so this trimmer works out well.</li>
    <li> My Norelco got here on time and it works excellently. I use to clean up down there and it is sharp and most importantly, does not tug at all. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Just if the comb was sturdier it would take 5 stars . if you press hard on the skin you feel that the comb starts to bend which will alter the desired length of hair .</li>
    <li> Wahl trimmers have an almost vertical set of blades and a much narrower blade that worked well for me for mustache.  However, their accessories fall off and break, so I decided to try this instead.  This is simply awful for mustache trimming.  The blade is far too wide for mustaches, and the deep, almost horizontal head make it impossible to really get at your mustache.  It would probably be OK for beards/goatees  (not sure it cuts every hair, may take a few passes, but no pulling or anything like that), but you have to buy another trimmer for mustaches.  Deal with the pain of the wahl combs and accessories, it is the only way to go I think.  Please reply if you know of a better system!</li>
    <li> Has continued working well and trims my facial and body hair better than expected for such a cheap device. I have been using it consistently for a few months now and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for either a facial or body trimmer.</li>
    <li> My last trimmer bought the farm so I replaced it with this. The settings were a little different then I am used to so the first trim was way shorter then I had intended. Works good and the charge lasts quite awhile. would have been nicer if it came with a stand but for the money it works well.</li>
    <li> perfect for trimming beard !</li>
    <li> nice feature is that you can set it to your beard or stash the way you want to look &amp; makes your look clean &amp; tight</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Norelco for a while now and am very satisfied with it! So this is definitely a recommendation.</li>
    <li> This is not what I wanted, it doesn&#x27;t trim, it rips random parts of your beard and the brush that used is a really bad one. I only use it without the brush to fully remove my beard since it cannot do anything else.</li>
    <li> Wow 20 bucks what a great deal I thought. Took a while to figure out what right length was to cover up the uneven way it cuts. stilli could live with this. 6 months alter it just stopped working, wont charge wont turn on nothing....</li>
    <li> Good Basic Trimmer.  Does the job !</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to replace my old beard trimmer and this came highly recommenced (God love Amazon customers).  I have to say they were right on the money.  Great trimmer (doesn&#x27;t get caught or pull) and holds an excellent charge (it&#x27;s been over a month since I first charged and still going.  Adjustable trimming is perfect.  Excellent value and product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this beard trimmer for a few months now and love it. Granted, I never owned a beard trimmer before so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it against. But this inexpensive trimmer works well. I can easily and quickly maintain the very short beard length I like. The trimmer is heavy duty and good quality. And it&#x27;s simple to clean after each trim. The battery is good for a half dozen or so trims before needing to be recharged. Not sure what else you&#x27;d want in a beard trimmer. For the price, this one is exceptional and I can&#x27;t think of a reason why I&#x27;d need to spend more for a different trimmer.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco QT4000 is versatile and easy to use for a novice at trimming beards like me.  Since it costs at least $5.00 to get a barber to trim a beard, it pays for itself in no time.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a concept: this tool, like all hand-held tools (and most other tools including, I would imagine, nuclear missles) takes a small learning curve to use. I took this for granted, but ... some people, maybe they don&#x27;t ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will do what you want it to do; just as simple as that. If you want the stubble look, it will take care of that easily, just use the lowest settings. If you want a short beard (and by this I mean as short as 4mm), it will do that. Want a somewhat fuller, 10mm (approximately) beard? It will do that; just turn to that setting and make several passes. Want a longer beard, one beyond the 10mm setting, even a big bushy beard, but groomed? Well, it will do that too, but this is where the learning curve really comes into play; a learning curve that requires YOU to use it with just a little skill. You can&#x27;t just flip it on, make a pass over your face, and expect what your mental vision to happen. You have to make things happen, especially if your intent is outside the tool&#x27;s settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It WILL take care of the hair under the nostrils if you take the comb off and use the uncovered blade(s) with a little skill. For that matter, you can use this arrangement to trim a full bushy beard, a whole lot easier than using scissors. But you&#x27;ll have to practice. In other words, this isn&#x27;t necessarily a &amp;#34;drive through, get the burger&amp;#34; situation (what is, other than that narrow lane around Mickey D&#x27;s). You have to expect to learn how to use it, which may or may not take a bit of time. I suppose some people will balk at this. Might be easier for those people to just pay a barber to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will this tool cut? Oh yeah, does this just fine, no hair pulling. Does the charge last beyond one use? Yes; so far, much beyond. Will you be happy with it? Depends on your expectation in what you see YOUR role in the situation is. My advice is to buy it, use it, be happy if it does what you want, easily. Buy it, try it, pick up any additionalskill it take to get to where you wanted to be. You&#x27;ll be better for trying it, whatever the outcome, because then you&#x27;ll know more about what you&#x27;re actually looking for.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer 3 weeks ago and have been using it regularly.  Seems to work alright I was hoping to use it for a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow look and it works okay.  I wish I had gotten one that cuts a little shorter though.  Haven&#x27;t used it as a beard trimmer yet but I think it will work fine.  I was disappointed to find the price dropped from $40 to $20 dollars in the span of 3 weeks though.  Wish I had known.  Be sure you don&#x27;t spend more than $20 on it.</li>
    <li> Good price.  The trimmer cut fairly well, no snags, but some longer hairs left behind.  10-adjustment setting is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am rating this a 2, is because I owned the product for 7 months, using it about 3-5 times a month before it died and would not turn back on.  21 to 35 uses total - charged about 3-4 times and never ran the battery dry.  I took it out one day and it was completely dead and would not turn on.  I assumed it needed to be charged, but after 4 hours on the charger - it still didn&#x27;t turn on.  I ended up letting it sit on the charger for another 6 hours a day later.  Still dead.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon only allowed returns up to 2 months.</li>
    <li> works great / nice even trim</li>
    <li> the adjustable guard isn&#x27;t very precise, at the higher setting it is unstable causing variations in length when trimming your beard. I tried to stick it out but after 3 weeks of use the stability got worse, not i just use it without the guard to trim around my ears and the straglers</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat this. It trims my beard better than any of the fancy stuff I own. really small size. I just love it. This has a permanent spot in my traveling bag.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my son. I was sick of seeing his beard unkempt. It works well and his beard is clean and trimmed. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer for the price, I&#x27;ve used it on the &#x27;5&#x27; and &#x27;2&#x27; setting depending on what look I was going for that week</li>
    <li> Well, my wife took it into her head that she wanted me to grow a gotee. I said, &amp;#34;Babe, you do realize that it would come in totally gray. It&#x27;ll make me look even more the old man that I am becoming.&amp;#34; I was convinced as the beard began to come in that she would relent and issue a directive to shave. To my surprise, she did a total reversal from her previous preference for clean shaven and said, &amp;#34;I like it; it makes you look sexy!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All rightie then. Who was I to argue with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This meant I needed an easy way to keep my new beard looking trimmed and neat. I checked in some of the stores and then here on Amazon. Based on the reviews and the price, I decided on this model. I especially like the adjustable design that you can dial in without changing combs at the head. I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer once a week or so for several months now without issue. It works great, making it easy to keep my beard from looking unruly and unkempt. An additional use I hadn&#x27;t counted on is using it for general &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34; of chest hair. The comb on the head also detaches easily for trimming sideburns and neck hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note however, be sure the trimmer ON/OFF switch is in the OFF position when you plug in the recharger. Otherwise it will not charge. You can also tell by the small light on the body of the charger. If it doesn&#x27;t light up, the trimmer is not charging. All in all, this is a super trimmer at a great price.</li>
    <li> This is a good low end low maintenance but reliable cleanup style beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Not fancy, but does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Philips beard trimmer which lasted for years and I really liked.  That beard trimmer had a trap that caught almost all the hair so it didn&#x27;t fall all over the sink and bathroom.  This one doesn&#x27;t, and I really miss it.  This one leaves hair everywhere.  The trim itself is good enough, but there&#x27;s way too much cleanup afterwards.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son as a starter, though long term seems practical too.  Lots of opts, but not tons of lovable parts</li>
    <li> Gets the job done really nicely, a little unwieldly around the jawbone but for that price it&#x27;s more than fine.</li>
    <li> This is a real review written by someone who wasn&#x27;t paid, who also has been using a Wahl hair trimmer on my face for 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first trimmer designed for precise beard trimming (as opposed to a hair trimmer used on my face). I found the dial adjustments very neat as I could visibly see the difference between 5 and 10 on my face. In that sense having that kind of control is great.  It&#x27;s also light in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was that the plastic cover (although soft) which does protect your skin from nicks, also makes it so that you have to go over some areas especially along the jawline over and over again. What I&#x27;m saying is that compared to a wider blade with large cutting teeth, this is less effective requiring more passes per section than a hair trimmer. This might be a weird blessing in disguise because you&#x27;re then forced to spend more time in an area double checking. I don&#x27;t know, sort of a personal thing, but using a hair trimmer is technically faster but more cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what caused me to write this review; it died after 1 use. The power started getting weaker and weaker until it just sputtered to a stop and wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I unplugged it from the wall and the base of the unit, tried a different socket and got the same result. I suspect the power supply died so I setup a return and will try the QT4014 for more precise control even thought it appears that it uses the same power supply, so I could be writing the same review for that in the future, hopefully not.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer, PROVIDED you like your beard or goatee short. Anything over about 1/4&amp;#34; is out of the question - even dialed all the way up. Does a great job within the range it has...just very limited on the range.</li>
    <li> no issues using this trimmer... able to set different trimming lengths just by rotating the blue wheel. very handy and easy to use and maintain. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> If you like keeping any size beard, you need this item. The smallest size gives me a little bit more than stubble but my favorite is 2 because it gives a very light beard and I don&#x27;t have to shave my neck because it doesn&#x27;t look that unkept. Product is easy to clean and for the price, I don&#x27;t think you can find anything better</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery serious people ! Congratulations thank you very much .</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband wanted. Works great!</li>
    <li> First let me say that if you care about the environment, you should read my final paragraph about the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer work in an office, and I hate to shave, so I decided to stop shaving recently.  I wanted a device that would simply take my beard down to stubble, and this device does that fairly well.  I found, however, that I had to remove the comb in order to get the closest shave.  If you leave the comb on, then you have to hold the trimmer at just the right angle in order to get an even shave.  With the comb off, you don&#x27;t have to be so careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I used the comb only once, and it felt awkward and poorly designed.  Because of that, my rating is based on using the shaver without the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the comb off, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t pull any hairs unless I pull it across my face very quickly when the hair is still long.  If I shave WITH the direction of the hairs, the stubble comes out longer than if I shave against the direction.  Consequently, I start out shaving with the direction of the hairs, and then end up shaving against it (to get the closest shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is fairly loud, which I don&#x27;t like, but I won&#x27;t go deaf from it.  Also, it is light, which is nice.  Somewhere in a box I have a barber&#x27;s shaver made of metal.  I could probably get the same kind of shave from that, but it would be fatiguing since it is heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to clean this device after every use; but when I removed the cutting assembly after using it, I found no hairs inside.  I&#x27;m sure that cleaning it once a week should be enough.  Indeed, removing the cutting assembly so frequently might wear out the plastic parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this trimmer.  It&#x27;s better than shaving.  If you need a close shave, however, it isn&#x27;t suitable.  The best it can do is to give you short stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the design:  Another reviewer said that the cutters should be on the inside edge (where the curve is).  At first I thought that too, but after using it a while, I realize that the cutters have to be on the outside of the curve, or you wouldn&#x27;t be able to shave concave areas, like under your chin.  However, the curved design of the handle isn&#x27;t necessary at all.  It forces me to hold the trimmer in just a certain way, which isn&#x27;t the way that feels natural to me.  After using the trimmer for a month or so, I&#x27;ve concluded that the handle would be more comfortable if it were straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small problem is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t have a light on it to tell you when the charging is finished.  Actually, I see something that looks like a light, but it doesn&#x27;t come on after charging, so it may not be working on my trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added later:  I purchased an Oster T-Finisher (a real barber&#x27;s tool) because I wanted my shaves to be closer, but the T-Finisher turned out to be inconvenient.  It is heavy, and the cord is thick, stiff and taut, and it was much more difficult to maneuver around my face.  It seems that what is needed is a product made for consumers, which means (1) cordless and (2) made of plastic so it is light.  I have no doubt that the Norelco trimmer will have to be replaced more often than the Oster T-Finisher would have been, but it is worth it for the extra convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added later:  I took a star off the review because the shaver must be fully charged in order to use it.  If the charge has run down, you can&#x27;t just plug it into the wall and use it that way.  This can prove to be a HUGE inconvenience when you need to shave before running out the door but the shaver isn&#x27;t charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco isn&#x27;t good about putting their products in environment-friendly packaging, and this device is no exception.  The outer cardboard box is coated with plastic, so it isn&#x27;t recyclable.  Inside the box, the trimmer is wedged between a clear and a red piece of molded plastic.  The pieces of plastic are recyclable and can be included with your cans and bottles, but you should recycle them separately (i.e., not attached to each other).  A lot of people don&#x27;t know this, but the plastic bubbles that a lot of items come in can be recycled.  However, if the bubble is attached to cardboard, you must pull it off the cardboard, and then recycle them separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  The trimmer started to malfunction after four years of use.  Is four years a long time?  I don&#x27;t think so.  Products aren&#x27;t built to last any more.</li>
    <li> Cheap, good, simple.  For what you are getting, it is solid.  Doesn&#x27;t have many bells and whistles on it, but you get what you pay for.  This was my first electric razor and I have been very happy.</li>
    <li> Everything about this trimmer works well. The battery holds a good charge. The adjustable head has plenty of settings. The blades are sharp and move quickly enough so it isn&#x27;t pulling your hair. The only complaint I have is that the charger has the light on it instead of the unit itself. So you can tell when it&#x27;s plugged in, but there&#x27;s no indication of the level of charge or when charging has completed.</li>
    <li> I like to have a beard that is pretty close to the face, almost stubbled, so i needed a beard trimmer like this that has multiple settings depending on the length you want. I typically use it on the 1 and 2 setting which keeps it short and even across the face. The part that locks in does a good job at keeping all the hairs trapped and easier for disposing. Since I don&#x27;t have a long beard, I can&#x27;t say how it would work for that, but for people that like a short beard, this is very nice and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Only 4 stars because you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging. Easy to clean and charges fast though.</li>
    <li> I titled this review upsetting because I loved this trimmer after the first time I used it but then it stopped working.  I tried charging it for hours but it appears to no longer function and I only used it once!  That one time however was very good and if it were still operable I would give this a 5 star recommendation.  So maybe it is just my bad luck as I don&#x27;t seem to see many other people with the similar complaint.  Still, you may want to purchase with caution and handle with even more caution.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer for my goatee.  It&#x27;s much better than the previous one I had been using.  Has excellent power, battery lasts a long time, and the charger works well in the infrequent times it&#x27;s needed. Bought one for my son too, hoping he&#x27;ll keep his beard trimmed more nicely as well!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is perfect. The battery seems to last a week of trimmings and the feature of the moving guard makes it very easy to change height. It was afraid it would not stay in place but its works perfect. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - very happy with it!!&lt;br /&gt;For the $$ it was worth every penny. I may buy another one soon!</li>
    <li> Battery last forever.. Haven&#x27;t charge mine since I bought it 2 months ago.</li>
    <li> The beard trimmer does its job very well and the adjustable levels do indeed work as advertised.  However, the charge is about 30 minutes long and it takes about 10 hours to recharge the thing, and you cannot really use it while it is recharging.  Essentially, if you don&#x27;t guess correctly, and you end up having less time than you need to trim your beard, you will need to panic in the morning to find a way to trim the other half.  Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want something overly loud and didn&#x27;t need the unit with the vacuum attached.  This trimmer gets the job done pretty well.  One gripe would be that sometimes I am guilty of pressing a little hard when trimming my beard, which causes the guard to change settings.  By the time I realize, I&#x27;m at a lower setting than I wanted.  However, I feel that&#x27;s a personal thing with whitch not many would have issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the neck, trimming up after/between haircuts, it&#x27;s does an adequate job.  It isn&#x27;t going to be as close as on of the &amp;#34;line-up&amp;#34; trimmers, but it does an ok enough job in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a simple, cordless trimmer that holds a charge for a good amount of time and gets the beard trimmed up, you found one here.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace one from another brand I&#x27;d gotten that looked fancier.  This one is much, much better and does the trick perfectly.  It holds a charge for many shaves, it has nice settings for beard length, it is much easier to clean, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and in sum it just works wonderfully.  In seriousness, it has improved my life having this vs the last couple I&#x27;ve had.  The prior ones I&#x27;ve had were tough to clean, couldn&#x27;t hold a charge for anything such that I often had to start charging them a half day before using them, didn&#x27;t trim as evenly... This is just a great product.</li>
    <li> I have the shaver set at the closest setting and it just is tough to get the job done properly.  The results are quite uneven. My previous beard trimmer was a Wahl which I gave 5 stars but it gave up the ghost.  I will not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I keep a short, full beard. This is the best product to keep it neat and trimmed. Norelco is the way to go for electric razors.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer - lightweight and is good for home and travel if needed. Simple and convenient components, nothing you don&#x27;t need on this thing. Adjustable with heights 1-10. The switches are sturdy and the build feels sturdy enough for a product like this one. About 6 or 7 inches long with a detachable piece on top for cleaning. Keeps my current sideburns/beard/mustache looking clean enough for the wife and kids, big fan! Arrived quickly with Prime.</li>
    <li> Simple to use, no flashy gimmicks.  0 - 10mm lengths.  Can use it while it&#x27;s charging.</li>
    <li> Its a great price, but it feels cheaply made, I don&#x27;t forsee the battery lasting as long as the manufacturer claims, but then again I did register it online and got an extra 1 year warranty, so if it craps out, I guarantee it will be sent back.  It cuts well and charges quickly, so I can&#x27;t complain there.</li>
    <li> Have not bought this product, but unless you are 100% sure you will like it I would not recommend buying it since Phillips Norelco return service is non existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Philips Norelco QT4070 Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro.  It mangled my beard, was disappointed by figured hey I have a 45 day risk free warrantee I will just return it.  Then found out the 45 day risk free warrantee is worthless since they can&#x27;t seem to email, snail mail, or fax a form to return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another product from Phillips Norelco and would strongly recommend that no one else does, until they fix their customer service.</li>
    <li> Impossible to buy an extra power block for less than the price of the trimmer.</li>
    <li> My husband says it works great, didn&#x27;t break the bank either. I considered buying a more expensive one but thought I would try my luck. Glad I did be cause it trims his beard well and for a fraction of the cost of the others I looked at.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this trimmer.  It is quite, charges easily and cuts his beard in a neat and even fashion simplifying a beautifying job that he simply despised.  Very satisfied overaall with this purchase.</li>
    <li> My Grandson graduated high school and I bought this for him.He had been using his older brothers all the time,so I thought this would help him if they each had one.I know he likes it a lot.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, love the adjustable head. Does  a terrific job, very satisfied with this product,  I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> great product and quality for the price.  No issues after using for a few months.  It would be nice if the smallest setting got closer to the skin like other beard trimmers do.  I think the smallest setting is almost too long for a stubble look.</li>
    <li> Easy to clean, light weight. Not expensive and thats the most interesting part of the item lol. Don&#x27;t have to charge it every day. Bought it for hubby and he love&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve only owned Norelco beard trimmers. they last a long time and the price is always good. this ones pretty nice, simple but effective. the height sets pretty eaisly and locks so it doesn&#x27;t move as much as some of my other beard trimmers i&#x27;ve owned which is a plus. i do notice sometimes it pulls some hairs but not that often. for the price can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer and its exacly as discribed. the trimmer days have begun, buy with convidence top quality</li>
    <li> I have used it a few times and work like a charm, very pleased with it so far, the batter lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> Impressive and light weight and charging is very fast.&lt;br /&gt;but its bit noisy.other then that its perfect</li>
    <li> This is a solid-feeling and no-nonsense trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;I really like the arrangement of the trimmer guide.  Unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve had, this guide does not wobble or move closer to the blade when pressure is applied, leading to an even trim throughout.  The ten choices of height for the guide is an added plus, as my previous two trimmers only had five. So far I&#x27;me very pleased!</li>
    <li> its very perfect to trim the beard. i didnt want anything else</li>
    <li> Buy this.  Just please... buy this.  I&#x27;m sure you hate changing guides, because we all do.  This makes it as easy as twisting a dial.  It&#x27;s also compact, easy to clean, holds a charge, and is inexpensive.  I don&#x27;t ever want to own a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; trimmer again.</li>
    <li> I have had this beard trimmer for 3 weeks now. It is still running on its initial charge. It trims very well. Some people ask : should I go with the direction of the beard or against it? In my case I go in all directions because some hairs seem to buck the trend and if you go in only one direction, you&#x27;ll miss them.Easy to use, easy to clean, easy on the wallet.</li>
    <li> the trimmer is a must have for any man with a beard.  It trims and shapes so that the beard lloks neat and groomed.</li>
    <li> Has been working fine for me, have had it for over a year now.</li>
    <li> Love the adjuster man. It works like a charm on my goat for sure. Have had it for 4 months and have not ran into any issues. I will say this, I am world&#x27;s worst at maintenance on these things. And I have not oiled or cleaned the teeth properly but I swear you will not notice any issue with these trimmers. Takes a licking and keeps on ticking. Also the battery life is good too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used beard trimmers since about &#x27;91. The Philips Norelco is the best brand because all the ones I&#x27;ve purchased last at least 5 years and they all are ergonomic to the face. Some trimmers have sharp edges, but Philips are all smooth. This one doesn&#x27;t have the frills that most others have; if all you want is to trim your beard, then this is it. It is priced extremely well. It seems to be the sharpest out of all the previous ones I&#x27;ve owned. Instead of using different attachments to get the correct length, Philips all adjust with a turn of a dial. I&#x27;ve never had this function fail and it is extremely easy to use. Also works great on the eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last one had a rubbery grip, which I liked better. This one is a little slipperier, but haven&#x27;t had any problems easily holding on to it.</li>
    <li> Have only used this a few times, but so far it has done exactly what it needs to do.  Haven&#x27;t used beard trimmers before, so this is my first one, but I decided it was time to actually keep it neat and groomed and this does the trick, keeps it looking even and cut.</li>
    <li> I tried a more expensive one, which was much better. I bought this one because of the low price, same manufacturer, and because I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to keep a beard. If I keep the beard I&#x27;ll buy the expensive one and use this on the dog.</li>
    <li> great trimmer. my husband loves it. its very quick. its just tkes 5 mins to do the triming. my husband tends to remove the comb and directly use the blade which is very effective.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it, and I also use it to cut his hair for him.  Great little trimmer--and hair cutter.</li>
    <li> Feels a bit cheap, but does the job well. Definitely not for long beards; on the longer settings, the comb doesn&#x27;t go through thick hair easily. For shorter stuff, it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my facial hair with because I hate taking the time to shave. It works wonderfully. Many different settings so you can change how much you are actually cutting. Great for trimming a beard. Recommend this product to anyone looking for a trimmer!</li>
    <li> I ordered the corded version but unexpectedly (and unhappily) received this cordless version. First..if you are accustomed to using a traditional trimmer.. The normal #2 trimmer is about a #5 on this trimmer. BUT.. It&#x27;s so smooth and comfortable.. And the charge lasts a really long time. I was going to send it back but I&#x27;m really happy with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a while to get a good shaver and found this one really good. Easy to clean and easy adjustable trim size. Love this product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Requires multiple passes to trim beard longer than 1/4&amp;#34;. Pain in the a$$ piece of junk. Has good battery life though :/</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this for the price. I kept buying medium priced trimmers at the store and they would not last long and did not function as well as this one. This was about half the price and much higher quality and functionality,</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son for his birthday.  He wears a very short beard at times.  He really likes it.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer at in incredible bargain. Easy to adjust the guard on the fly, easy to clean. I was originally concerned about the battery life, but I&#x27;ve used it for weeks on a single charge.</li>
    <li> Husbands really likes this trimmer but it does make quite a mess!  Like other reviews, he did say the guard makes it difficult to get above the upper lip.</li>
    <li> The beard length adjuster is a flimsy piece of plastic supported on only 1 side. So if you press too hard, the plastic flexes and you end up trimming far shorter than expected. It will do until I buy a better quality trimmer.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is a bit smaller and lighter than I expected.  It runs fine and seems to have no defects, but I am dissatisfied with it.  The adjustable head tends to bend toward the cutter as you move it out to the higher (longer) settings and is flimsy (flexible) such that the actual cutting length seems to vary too much.  Lastly, the guide isn&#x27;t removable and gets in the way for the touch up work with the distance is set to zero.  I&#x27;ve given up on this and ordered the Remington MB4040 which I have used and am very happy with.</li>
    <li> I replaced a remington with this here trimmer, I loved the remington but the stand by battery at full charge was an hour, and could only get one trim out of it before it was dead, then it took like 5 hours to charge enough to use....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This&#x27;n however lasts such a long time with many uses before a charge is needed. It seems to charge pretty quick t, nice trimmer, will definately buy another philips.</li>
    <li> Very convenient to use and maintain, this product has so far been great. Whether using the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; feature or closer edging, it&#x27;s ergonomic handling is wonderful.</li>
    <li> device is not working properly. Length adjustment is not working properly. Did not meet the expectations. Not Happy with the device.</li>
    <li> I like (and my wife likes) to keep a close cropped beard/ shadow look.  This tool is easy to adjust and cuts well.  My initial impression is that I like, don&#x27;t love it.  I find the shape to be a little awkward, nothing really bad just a little off for me.</li>
    <li> the charging is fair. the cable is not matched with other philips shaving  products I have. which makes it complicated to manage different cables....what a mess philips!!??</li>
    <li> If Keeping your facial hair trim and neat this is the product is for you. I purchased Phillips Norelco &#x27;QT400/42&#x27; Beard Trimmer and have found this is a EASY and FAST way to accomplish this look.... 30 seconds every morning.&lt;br /&gt;The Product also has several settings to give you the look you want!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;new look&amp;#34; for facial hair seems to require closely trimming every few days.  This trimmer works as advertised.  The settings are easily adjustable and the trim is even and the cut is clean.</li>
    <li> Very nice beard trimmer! The only one thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t work if it is not charged. I mean, you can use it while charging</li>
    <li> I have been happy with this trimmer, it has done me well and I use it on a 8 setting which is the perfect look I want.  It has not made my beard look &amp;#34;patchy&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;uneven&amp;#34; when I use it which is what I was worried about from past experiences with other trimmers.</li>
    <li> My hubby said he hasn&#x27;t charged it for two weeks.  That&#x27;s convenient for him.  I guess it works as he wants it to, because I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.  It was a reasonable price compared to many others, and that made me happy.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer for it&#x27;s price, 10 settings from peach fuzz to jesus beards. It is really easy to clean and make sure to keep it charged! You have to go a little slow if you have a rough beard like mine or else it&#x27;s good! Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> it has served me well. blade has stayed sharp and the comb is reliable and consistent when it comes to staying in the desired setting/number. Small and light and the charger has a long enough cord for me to use it plugged in, not like i&#x27;ve ever had to tough</li>
    <li> Works great. It&#x27;s nice to finally have a trimmer which I can adjust and cuts evenly all over without getting jammed.</li>
    <li> This is a great little trimmer, the adjustment style is solid and easy to use. You can also pull off the guard to shape your facial hair.</li>
    <li> Good price, simple to use, perfect!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, decent buy for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t do well cutting facial hair that tends to grow alongside the face.  There&#x27;s no feature that pulls the hair up before it cuts, so sometimes I&#x27;m left with hairy patches that the trimmer can&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> It works very well for the price. Easy to adjust the length setting, which makes for a quick and easy shave session.</li>
    <li> My husband received this as a gift and he absolutely loves it.  It&#x27;s small, powerful and a serious improvement over the previous model.</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself and one for my brother. Easy, portable personal groomer at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a month now and use it often, and I have only had it charge it once. Great product and probably the best price as well.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times, but it doesn&#x27;t seem noticeably better than my last cheaper beard trimmer. does a good job.  Easy to use and easy to adjust.</li>
    <li> It is compact and ideal for constant use. It is lightweight and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;Would lack an LED light or a battery level indicator, another bad point is that you can not use while charging, if you do it the blade stops again.&lt;br /&gt;It feels soft, no scrapes or spider.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product, very practical, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim down my beard.  I love the selection of lengths they have.  Most trimmers only have 3-4 and this one has 8 I believe.  Works great and holds a charge for a while.</li>
    <li> Good s*** yo,keeps my s*** looking clean yo.I would&#x27;ve given it a 10 but I can&#x27;t yo.happy new year!! I don&#x27;t talk like that haha well sometimes just to mess around.</li>
    <li> Works well but seems cheaply made.</li>
    <li> So far this is a great trimmer. This get a nice tight trim. I do not like to keep my beard to long but the out of bed shave. This is what you need. I keep the setting on one.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a companion for my sensor 3D razor.  The battery has an excellent duration, lot of adjustment (10 levels) and easily to clean.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer.  My previous trimmer (same brand) was also great and lasted for about a decade. Finally a plastic piece broke off the guard thingy.  At these low prices, buying a new one made sense.  It&#x27;s a sleeker design than my old one,  and the guard  looks more sturdy. Only one minor gripe -easily adjusted for.  The settings are a bit different than the older one, so setting it on &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; resulted in a shorter beard than with the old one.  So now I use seeing &amp;#34;3.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;ve only had this for a week or so, I&#x27;ve used it several times already. So far, it is far superior to other (even more expensive) small shavers I&#x27;ve purchased at local stores. It takes a time or two to get used to the adjustments (start on a higher setting so as to not accidentally shave too close!). Very ergonomic and not at all awkward to use. I like that there is only one (adjustable) guard to deal with and it is easy to clean. The shaver and guard appears a bit flimsy (all lightweight plastic), but time will tell with regards to its durability. For the price (under $20), I&#x27;m sure it would be hard to find a better one.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and a charge will last forever.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend, he loves it. Battery lasts for a good amount of time, does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with this trimmer. My biggest complaint is that the gaurd is very flimsy, creating an uneven shave. This trimmer will not give you that nice clean look. It will make your beard look patchy and uneven. Battery life is good, but if it can&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to whats the point. I just use it for light manscaping now since it can&#x27;t pass the beard test.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I have used. It&#x27;s low price makes it an even better value. The adjustable length guard is very clever-much handier than the typical separate snap-on guards.Remove the guard it does a great job trimming the back of your neck without scratching and irritating like my previous Wahl did.</li>
    <li> Cleaned after every use, oiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Internals fell apart in about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it was cheaper than a barber.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before. Very satisified.</li>
    <li> The most idiotic fixed guard switch.  This product has never trimmed my beard evenly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m getting 3 months battery life on one charge using it daily.</li>
    <li> Hubby looks a lot better cleaned up!</li>
    <li> Outstanding trimmer. Trims perfectly based on the setting. You cannot beat this for the price and usability. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, it does the job ... it&#x27;s a trimmer so it trim  don&#x27;t expect a shaving with that ( some reviews sounded like they expecting a close shaving ... be for real)_</li>
    <li> Compared to other electric beard trimmers I have used, this one excels in being able to cut relatively shorter facial hair at a variety of heights and at having a great battery life. As other reviewers have noted, this would not be great at trimming very long beards, since it maxes out at medium lengths. Therefore, it is best for a stubble look or a shorter beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is great, I only charge it once every week or so. A BIG drawback is that if it does run out of battery, it will not run off outlet power, you will have to wait for it to charge a bit (it does relatively quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps my least favorite quality of this trimmer is that it lacks a vacuum, meaning that you will have hair all over your sink area after using it. To say the least, my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like having small beard hairs all over our bathroom so I have to be careful to clean it up. Higher end trimmers have a vacuum and I think I would have bought one of those if I had to buy another.</li>
    <li> The way this thing works is fantastic. The dial gives a lot of precision and it is able to trim both short and long with very good precision. Works incredibly well, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Great beard trimmer. Easy cleaning, has lots of length settings, lightweight but durable, decent battery life (~40minutes). All that you need, and nothing more. It&#x27;s not too electronic which makes me think there are fewer things that could go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> This product works just as advertised. It&#x27;s very easy to use, has many options for length, and holds a charge for a while!</li>
    <li> I see no big difference between the different lenght settings, other than that, great product. Have been using it twice a week for the last month and the battery is going on strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;e had it for about 6 months at this point at it&#x27;s still holding up well. Good battery life and does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> Leaves my whiskers nice</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to use. Good Product. Recommend it for those who dont always need clean shave.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I owned a Remington that was a few dollars more prior to this... it broke. Bought this, cautiously, hoping to save a few dollars, and am incredibly happy - it cuts my facial hair perfectly - highly recommend! Works better than the Remington for trimming. Using the bare blade (without the guard, prior to shaving clean with a blade) can result in a bit of irritation, but if you&#x27;re just looking for a bear trimmer, it does a great job!</li>
    <li> So far only using #1 setting since I want to keep short.  I use it 2-3 times a week and everything looks good.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer works as advertised. It is really designed as a stubble trimmer rather than beard trimmer but does the job up to a certain point. The teeth on the cutters are rounded which make it comfortable on the face but causes the trimmer to not cut as good as it should. Overall, I think it was well worth the 20 bucks I paid for it but if you need a beard trimmer, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Settings are whack. Difficult to get any consistency throughout face. Not sure why its rating is so high.</li>
    <li> Well what can I say it does what it is suppose to and it has not broke down yet.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! Built in height adjustment is great</li>
    <li> Does the job like a charm and is a small device, easy to take on travels!</li>
    <li> This trimmer can be frustrating for trimming facial hair such as mustaches. The issue is that my mustache will grow past my lip and require trimming, I had an older trimmer that died and it did not have the adjustment permanently fixed on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I learned how to trim my mustache with the other trimmer and as such prefer that style of trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this trimmer&#x27;s adjustment cannot be removed I feel that I cannot properly trim my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is isn&#x27;t too bad at keeping other facial hair at the desired length, just make sure you gauge the angle correctly or you will not trim it properly and overshoot/undershoot your desired length.</li>
    <li> The trimmer does not clean very easily.  I have to continuallt stop and pull it apart to clean trimkings from the blade and guard</li>
    <li> It works OK but it&#x27;s not as good as I expected from a company as well known as Norelco. But for the price it did the job. But I&#x27;m on the look out for a better beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> The Phillips Norelco beard trimmer is exactly what I wanted. If I wanted to look like the Duck Commander I wouldn&#x27;t need a beard trimmer. The settings are easy to use and it is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This items is really expensive &amp; of low quality, don&#x27;t buy this s***. Moreover hard to clean &amp; the battery if poor.</li>
    <li> I had an older Norelco Maverick beard trimmer and I loved it. You could trim very close or as long as about an inch. Also, the comb, guide was very sturdy. This new one only allows for beards about 1/3 to 1/2 inch. The comb is only supported on one side, very flimsy feeling. Now I&#x27;m looking for something better. Norelco has really gone down in quality over the years. In the 90&#x27;s I was a repairman for razors. I used to think that Norelco was top of the line. They still might be, if everyone went downhill with them! I still have my plug in razor from the 1970&#x27;s and it runs great....solid as a rock!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two others (years ago, can&#x27;t remember names) but this has been by far the best and simplest. Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for attachments.</li>
    <li> Performs well - I&#x27;ve used this both for beard and mustache trimming and also for just shearing the whole thing.  It holds a charge for a long time.  Easy to clean.  I love that it comes with just one attachment that is adjustable for many different lengths as opposed to a whole bag of attachments, which are a pain.  (that&#x27;s what my previous Norelco had)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a year. Works great and holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
    <li> After less than a year the crappy thing broke.  Doesn&#x27;t work at all now, and I&#x27;m off to buy another trimmer.  BOOO!</li>
    <li> So far so good, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I had a clipper that I use to cut my hair, but even the smallest attachment was not short enough for my beard.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend more than $40 so when I found this for $20 I thought it was worth a try.  Most were at least $50 and more, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything great.  I just need something reliable that can cut my beard at the length I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper was perfect.  It&#x27;s easy to use and the attachment has ten adjustable levels for all beard lengths.  I am very happy with this clipper.  If it lasts a couple of years I would have no complaints.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this affordable and efficient clipper.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Battery life could be a little better, but not a big deal.  Just anticipate charging the unit after using it each time so to avoid having a half trimmed beard the next time around on the same charge.</li>
    <li> It works well, but it&#x27;s not as gentle. I&#x27;ve cut my boyfriend a couple times by doing nothing more than lightly trimming his neck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really powerful and cuts everything in a single go. I especially love the separator that&#x27;s integrated (it can be removed for cleaning / replacing) as I like keeping my sideburns at a certain length.</li>
    <li> Works great. Does everything I expected for keeping my beard trimmed. Charge has lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> Works well. Adjustable trim heights is very easy to use and very easy to disassemble for cleaning.  Long battery life is helpful.</li>
    <li> The guard blocks longer hair so they can&#x27;t be cut because it just pushes them away from the blade.. very poor design for the blade guard.&lt;br /&gt; With such a poor blade guard the trimmer has been reduced to a neck trimmer and even then,&lt;br /&gt; It does not give a close trim..&lt;br /&gt; Such a real bummer Norelco is a very quality product otherwise!</li>
    <li> I received it no more than 30 minutes ago and took it for a test drive.  It&#x27;s a very simple one-piece design with no extra attachments.  One pass in a couple of directions and the goatee trimming was done evenly.  The 5 star rating might have a little something to do with my previous trimmer that was nothing but 3 months of bad experiences.  The Philips Norelco QT4000/42 did an excellent trim job.  Even if it last only a year I&#x27;d still be happy with this purchase.  If you get this trimmer make sure you register it.  You get a 2 1/2 year warranty.  I just can&#x27;t see going wrong with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous trimmer was a Wahl brand.  [[ASIN:B00009RF1E Wahl 9918 6171 Groomsman Mustache Trimmer]]  I could only take the pain for 3 months.  It would pull beard hairs and I don&#x27;t think I need to explain that pain...simply put, it HURTS.  Between the pulling and the poor attachments, I gave it the boot last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m beard trimming pain free again since purchasing the Norelco QT4000/42.  I&#x27;m already having a better year!</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s a good one. I got these for my pops for christmas and he really likes it. He says it runs smoothly and works well. He&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> First time out of the nox gave a great trim. Bought it for a male friend. He loves it. Great price.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t cut as it say i use on my beard and it didnt reach 1mm even I WANT MY MONEY BACK</li>
    <li> Gift for son who asked specifically for a beard trimmer and not an electric razor. He found the multiple-level dial option for selecting trim length really nice. Easy to hold and use.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband. Cuts evenly, easy to adjust, easy to clean. His only complaint is it cut pretty slow. His old corded electric trimmer could trim his beard in 15-20 seconds easily. This one takes about 45-60 seconds because he has to continually go back over the same areas at different angles to make sure all the hairs are cut equally. A minor complaint. He would buy this trimmer again.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, has ten measures, very easy to use, has a normal size to use it .</li>
    <li> The battery lasts a long time, the blades are sharp.  I replaced an older Norelco with this.  The things that are a bit different is the fact that a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; on my old trimmer was WAY longer than a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; on this one.  So the scale changed.  And it&#x27;s a bit weird and really doesn&#x27;t matter, but the trimmer is facing the opposite way compared to my old trimmer.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I like that you can just use different trimming numbers without any extra pieces.&lt;br /&gt;2. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None.</li>
    <li> It works, + yeah, for the price, of &amp;#60; $20 definitely recomemend if you need to like shave w.e. I recommend it if you just need the occasional armpit, private area trimming. this is good for that .</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says, no razor burn.  If you get razor burn, maybe you should buy a woman&#x27;s razor</li>
    <li> It feels light and a little flimsy, but so far it&#x27;s working great and frankly, for the price, much better than expected. Simple.</li>
    <li> It met my expectations . The best part is it is easy to use and to adjust the length for trimming you just need to turn the knob to the right number .</li>
    <li> We bought this as a gift for our son.  He wanted something to keep his beard trimed and was not a lot of trouble.  He loves this trimmer - easy to use!</li>
    <li> this is a quality trimmer for the price. i like it so far, and it seems like it will hold up for a while.</li>
    <li> Best product for this price.&lt;br /&gt;It is very handy and easy to clean compare to my previous shaver. Accessories along with this shaver is perfect, not too many or not less.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. The click to change length feature is nice, but it&#x27;s not the greatest at buzzing. You have to go over and over the same spot for it to cut all the hair. It takes me twice as long to use this compared to regular shaving.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and this does the job just fine. Charge last for few days but when charge is low you can&#x27;t use it you have to wait until it&#x27;s completely charged.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for very long and takes ten hours to charge to full capacity. but it works great.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer for few months and am loving it. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I have now boughten this product twice.  The first one I bought stopped working after a few months, the second one I bought never worked at all.  I wanted a cheaper trimmer, but I ended up having to go with a Wahl Lithium Ion trimmer, hopefully that will work better than these have.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Only for short beard styles though.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer probably 2 months now and it won&#x27;t hold a charge. I would not buy another Phillips razor ever again. Biggest POS ever. Not even worth the hassle of returning</li>
    <li> Works perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool! Re-grew a mustache &amp; chin whiskers after 25 years &amp; with this trimmer, keeping them at the desired length &amp; perfectly &amp;#34;Edged&amp;#34; is much easier!</li>
    <li> It was good while it lasted. I bought this trimmer in Oct/14 and less than a year after (July/15) it stopped charging properly. I have charged for 6 hours, 24h and 48h and the result is the same: it only works for about 60 seconds. And since it only works cordless (no shaving while it charges if battery is low), I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
    <li> I wanted a beard trimmer that allowed me to control length and trim to a consistent level. This product does that with a built in  rotary dial. Product works as advertised and I recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer love the thumb dial.</li>
    <li> My second one since I lost the charger for my first.  Great shaver, used the last one for about 4 months before I lost the charger.  Cheap but better than a lot of more expensive razors for beard trimming.  I love the built in length trimmer</li>
    <li> Works well when wet, holds charge for a long time, adjustable trimming length on point</li>
    <li> nothing better than this!!</li>
    <li> I just received the Norelco today and just finished using it. I can say that it was what I  expected, it even came charged,  so I could use it right  away.  It cut with great ease and was easy to use.  I started off at level 5 (5mm) and it left it at my usual length. I don&#x27;t keep a long beard so the 5 is pretty nice,  although I might experiment with various lengths just because its easy to do so. It changes length very easily and stays in place. The guard comes off easily but not so much that it will fall off. I found it comfortable to use and easy to maneuver,  it feels very good in hand. I would have preferred a stand to dock it while charging but 20 bucks is a good deal. I had a Remington  that worked for years but the extra heads got damaged and ultimately it just stopped charging. While not the most comprehensive, it does a nice job for the price. I just needed it to keep my beard in check  and i have no doubt that it will do just that. A good buy and i would recommend it..</li>
    <li> This thing cuts my beard pretty well. The height settings are decent and it doesn&#x27;t usually leave short spots. The trimmer is wide and sharp.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancé and he is amazed at how well it works for the price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most inexpensive trimmers ive seen and it works great! Ive been using it for over a month daily and works just fine. I have nothing to complain about.</li>
    <li> Have had this for about two months so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Does the job, easy to clean. Quick. Not too noisy. Good charge - I&#x27;ve gone for several weeks and it&#x27;s still on the initial charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;m trying to find a beard length that looks good for me and finding that as I grow my beard out longer it&#x27;s more of a challenge to trim without multiple passes. There&#x27;s no battery display level but that&#x27;s not as big a deal as it doesn&#x27;t need as frequent charging as an electric shaver. It does have an unfortunate habit of spitting hairs EVERYWHERE while in operation however making cleanup a chore. You may want to lay a bag or something over the sink or shave outdoors with a mirror (!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Serviceable and affordable trimmer for new beard growers. May not be best choice in long term or for those with longer beards. If your budget allows for it - opt for a trimmer with a vacuum option to skip the of the post trimming cleanup of hairs.</li>
    <li> The trimmer worked great during first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a trimmer that had:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Trims short, goes down to 1mm with comb and shorter with comb removed.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Had to have an adjustable comb, I hate keeping track of removable combs.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Trimmer cutting head close to end of comb, makes it easier to trim under nose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also WANTED rounded comb tips so it would not poke when trimming under nose and a comb that&lt;br /&gt;would penetrate a dense beard when I let it get a little too long ( I keep it between 8-20mm ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer did it all and is well designed to boot! It has a rounded, efficient comb PLUS rounded, self sharpening&lt;br /&gt;trimmer blades so you don&#x27;t have to worry about nipping ears/delicate areas near as much.  The comb is easily removed to get to&lt;br /&gt;blades for the edging or neck trimming.  The blade pops off and on easy for cleaning too.  It gets close up-under nose for neat/even mustache trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t say how nice it is to use a great all around trimmer after 2 recent disappointments.  The only knock I have is&lt;br /&gt;the taper of the handle kind of makes it feel like it wants to slip out of my hand when using, but this is a MINOR issue.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could be bad from here is if it goes kaput or the batteries don&#x27;t last.  I am SUPER happy so far!</li>
    <li> Great, simple to use.  My only complaint would be the dial in the center.  A few times while trimming my beard the blue knob has adjusted and starts trimming my beard at a shorter setting than I wanted.</li>
    <li> wife had me shave off my beard after 5 years, said I look many years younger.</li>
    <li> works great to keep beard trimmed at short legnth.</li>
    <li> Looked at a higher end models, read reviews etc but decided to go with the more basic model for shaping up the beard and it works great. Have no issues with the blade pulling on the hair and the various size settings are more then adequate for me. The removable comb allows for a very close cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that hair gets everywhere, all over the sink, your shirt etc...</li>
    <li> Not possible to more cheaply build a product.  Never trimmed my bread very well and it broke the first time I dropped it into the sink.</li>
    <li> My previous Philips beard trimmer had a head that followed my face and this one doesn&#x27;t.  I have to be more careful now to cut my beard evenly.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I am buying this product. The first time it did not work and the second time it stopped working in 4 days. I guess this is what you get for buying the cheapest product in the market.</li>
    <li> giving it maximum stars because thats the best trimmer that i have ever used . have tried almost three barun trimmers and wated maybe  more than 120 dollars but this 22 dollar prodcut it really worth it . it really looks to be a simple trimmer but its machine is very powerful which is what you would ike to have . throw away all the trimmers and use phillpis norcelo ; this is what i heard in a youtube video from a person expert in trimming beard and i feel like he was right on the money .</li>
    <li> Quality personal electronic shaver.  Works great.  Charge lasts for over a week with regular use.  Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nicks and blood on my man-parts are not my idea of a good time. I want to be reckless, get the job done and all without needing an attache case to carry the components needed to do so. This is hands down, the best man-groomer on the market. I can take the &amp;#34;yard&amp;#34; down from an inch, to a multiple-level masterpiece in minutes, and not have to ask for Divine protection in the process. The battery lasts forever, the blade is a one-pass deal and the design was made by someone with hair.&lt;br /&gt;You can Wal-Mart it if you want to, but I&#x27;m done bleeding. this thing&#x27;s legit.</li>
    <li> A good razor, it has a long battery life and I like the shave it gives.  It has given me some superficial cuts around the lips on its shortest trim setting, so be a little careful I guess.</li>
    <li> This is a simple to use trimmer and very light weight. Just what I needed. Packaging was perfect and delivery was two day as promised.</li>
    <li> Trim guard works, battery lasts, does nice job trimming. Overall very happy...keeps me looking very clean cut when it counts the most!</li>
    <li> Gets her done, major upgrade from my more expensive crappy trimmer. No reason to buy anything more expensive than this one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard by any means and wanted something to use just to trim.  This was perfectly suitable, has great battery life, and easily portable.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer. The battery is not as lasting as it supposed to be but the trimmer itself is great, and very cheap.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works great but the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is not water proof. If you can get over that fact, I would recommend buying it!</li>
    <li> the razor was returned immediately as the blades seemed to pull on my beard, it definitly did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> Short life of the battery. It doesnt cut your bread completly</li>
    <li> bought this for my dad for his birthday.  he loves it.  it&#x27;s well made, and there are many settings to choose from.  he uses it for beard grooming as well as keeping his super short hair super short!</li>
    <li> For starters, it arrived a day early.  Can never argue with that.  As far as the trimmer goes, it works.  It works really good.  My last trimmer only had 5 setting and this one has 10 so my first trim was really short.  Once I adjusted to the correct length it was fantastic.  I would highly recommend this to anybody in need of a trimmer.</li>
    <li> Really good beard trimmer for the price. Easily washable and doesn&#x27;t leave a big mess. It has a lot of setting options which helps keep the beard at the right size! Great investment!</li>
    <li> I love this beard trimmer. It makes maintenance significantly easier and fits in my travel bag really easily. Battery lasts forever and allows me to trim my beard to any length I want. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Simple, does the job.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut hair, I don&#x27;t know what it would be used for. So confused when I first saw it, waste</li>
    <li> Great For cleaning up my face or even a bit of Man&#x27;&#x27;scaping&amp;#34; downunder.... Easy to use adjustable head. Only one gripe i wish the teeth on the trimmer was a bit tighter.  It pinches a bit at the wrong angle against the skin.  But for 25bucks can&#x27;t beat it</li>
    <li> Works as expected, but seems as though the charge doesn&#x27;t last very long (15-20)mins, but good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Works good, yet sometimes pulls hair out.  Also, there is no charge light so you never know how much battery you have left or how much its charged which is very annoying.</li>
    <li> Reason for Ordering: Highest rated &amp;#60;$20 Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Usage: Almost twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is easy to use, with battery lasting for a 20+ minutes minimum. Recharge is taking around 12 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer functions are easy and results are decent. As mentioned it definitely doesnt give a accurate trimming lengths at 1 mm precision, but almost equivalent of a close shave. After using a month, till now it hasnt scratched my skin, just smooth trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended who want a quick way out of shaving with blades, this piece definitely moves like magic. You want something that lasts long (2.5 years warranty after registering the product) and at the same time gives a decent output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who travel a lot i&#x27;d recommend go for the 4014/42 model, which is priced a bit higher, but has faster, longer lasting charge and also works wireless.</li>
    <li> So far, this little guy is working great. Very lite, and easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well. I wish the battery lasted longer, but hey, going to town downtown can take some serious weed-whacking.</li>
    <li> A &amp;#34;Must Have&amp;#34; for men with beards. I use mine once a week to keep my beard at the length I like</li>
    <li> Works great as a beard trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to keep my beard at a constant stubble length. I would take the guard off and use this trimmer free hand - never cut myself. And the beard looked good :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> On time and great value!</li>
    <li> i love this trimmer works great!, best brand i have ever purchased no problems with it at all a must buy for college kids!</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and trim my beard and this product does a nice job. The only drawback I found is that the battery is the type that has a memory and Philips Norelco recommends you recharge it after you use it for about a half an hour and fully discharge it twice a year. They also recommend you don&#x27;t leave it on the charger for over about 10 hours at a time.</li>
    <li> Makes hairs on my face shorter than they were using a series of metal choppy things. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave me with an even shave. Had a wahl previously for cheaper that performed better.</li>
    <li> Really Like it. Trims well. I just wish it came with a stand that you could keep it in.</li>
    <li> Works well. Good buy!</li>
    <li> Works very well at cutting.  Takes some getting used to in order to figure out the right lengths.  Outer shell is plastic, not as hard and durable as my old shaver but it should hold up with normal use.  Cutting guide is not removable to get down to shaved level, will have to use my hair trimmer for that for the top of my head.  All in all, a good value.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer with a long battery life and at a great value.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Worked very well for 1.5 years. Got a great amount of use out of it, providing an even trim regardless of length. Stopped working recently - will try to take advantage of 2 year warranty for this product. Otherwise good - holds charge well.</li>
    <li> This trimmer didn&#x27;t even last 15 days of use. The battery can&#x27;t hold a charge and is now useless. After buying a similar Phillips beard trimmer which lasted a year, I thought this would at least provide the same durability. I was very wrong.</li>
    <li> What makes this trimmer great is that I needs no attachments and you just turn a wheel for the settings. Simple and easy.</li>
    <li> It came with a charger that doesn&#x27;t fit, out of the box. I had to cut the charger cord myself (with a sharp knife) to make it fit...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that annoyance, this trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim evenly. I can&#x27;t get it to have all my hair on my face the same length. If you want to look good, spend a bit more on a trimmer that will be even.</li>
    <li> Incredible product. I&#x27;m really happy I bought it. Cheap and does a great job trimming my beard. I haven&#x27;t charged it yet but I hope that when I do the battery will charge quickly. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Good product, less expensive, good service</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a beard, but worked where I used it.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Simple and efficient. I would expect something like this to be closer to $50, great deal.</li>
    <li> Great product. Gift for the hubby and it seems to work well. He&#x27;s used it a few times. It trims his goatee hairs all even. I like that it&#x27;s small as well as the detachable cord so I can throw it in the little grooming basket I keep in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband because he was tired of putting AA battery in his Remington.This trimmer is lighter than his old one and has 10 setting compared to 6 with his old one.Trims hairs even and easy,doesn&#x27;t get caught on hairs.Came to us already charged and ready  to use and with a 2 1/2 year warranty.</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say about the quality of the trim, it&#x27;s pretty decent overall.  But despite that, this trimmer is practically useless a few months after buying it.  They claim the battery lasts 35 minutes on a 10 hour charge, but I&#x27;m lucky if I get 5 minutes out of it.  I normally can&#x27;t even get through an entire trim before the battery runs out.  What&#x27;s worse, when plugged in the outlet doesn&#x27;t power the trimmer and doesn&#x27;t recharge the battery fast enough to keep trimming.  I typically have to trim half my face, let it charge for a few hours, then finish the job.  And now I have to buy a new trimmer.</li>
    <li> The plastic part that touches your face, is very thin and bendy which means that if you put more pressure on one part of your face then the other, it will cut shorter. Maybe this is my fault for not having experience with a trimmer but it totally screwed my beard up. Simply make this part of the machine aluminum or a better plastic and this would be a great product. I should have to worry about the amount of pressure I put on my face being consistent. Could use a better battery life as well but hey they have a separate model for that so maybe that&#x27;s my fault for not buying the better one. Decent for the price though, will use it for body hair from now on though..</li>
    <li> I bought this beard trimmer because I just started experimenting with different facial hair looks. It is an easy to use, easy to maintain beard trimmer that works as it should. Very good value for the price, especially if you are not sure if you want to stick with a beard. If you know you are sticking to the beard for a bit, you might want to upgrade from this trimmer as this is a no frills model. Overall, this works very well for what I need, would recommend.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old Conair I had that stopped working after years of use. New one lasts way longer on a charge. I only need to charge the Phillips Norelco once in a while and use it for several shaves. It&#x27;s yet to shut off during a session. It does a decent job of cutting beard and other facial hair. Adjusting option is a huge plus. I remove the adjusting piece when I&#x27;m looking for a fairly low trim. Saves me many trips to the barber.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t shave your man regions with this guy. The thing even cuts my arms. This is not a good product for that type of use. Works ring for stubble and beard trimming, not a multi tasker.</li>
    <li> I like to have stubble, even though I can&#x27;t grow long facial hair. But it helps because I can keep shaving my face the same length to make it look like I have a fuller beard.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a close trim, I would recommend the Remington MB4040 over this product when used without any guards.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is quite compact and does not have too many attachments (just 1). It is very easy on the skin even if you remove the attachment. It can help you maintain a stubble or a decent sized (10 setting) beard. It is quite easy to clean. I wish this was made with a lithium ion battery so the charge lasted longer and was able to charge faster but besides this, it is a great trimmer.</li>
    <li> Does a good job. As advertised</li>
    <li> Im 20 years old and like to have a good amount of facial hair but i get bothered when it gets to a certain size. This allows me to set the length i want and keep my beard to that size. I&#x27;ve had it for months now and have not had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for many years and I have tried a few trimmers through those years. I thought I would try this one as the price was right but I absolutely it. Uneven cut and very uncomfortable. Good news is my beard will grow back from this hack job. I thought I would save some money but that was a mistake. Definitely going back to my Remington!</li>
    <li> had a philips before but this but this one seems so under powered.  the guard fills with hair and you have to empty it multiple times during shaving.  I should have ordered the old one that i had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARF42H0?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if philips wants to send me this one i would love it!!!</li>
    <li> This product not only met my needs, but it exceeded them. I have been keeping a beard for about a year now and was using a standard hair clipper to keep it trim. Man, was I doing it all wrong. This is a game-changer because I can now be more precise with the length of my stubble whenever I want to trip up to keep looking my best. Also, it&#x27;s a big bonus that this trimmer is cordless and the battery lasts forever so you can really give the whiskers a thorough hacking if needed. Obviously, another great benefit is that you can use this trimmer to keep the pubes trimmed too. It comes with a cleaning brush so you can brush off stray hairs so I definitely feel comfortable going back and forth from trimming the beard then trimming the pubes and vice versa.</li>
    <li> It works.  It appears to be sturdy and i believe it will last a good while.  I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it a couple of weeks now, and so far, I am happy with the product. I have used it a few times to clean up my beard and mustache, and it hasn&#x27;t given me any problems whatsoever. My goatee was pretty thick at the time of my initial use, and it cut through that effortlessly. It didn&#x27;t give me a skin shave at the lowest setting when I was edging everything up, but it still did a nice job (kinda like the scruffy look). I am not sure how long it continuously run without plugging it in, as I have just used it for a few minutes and plug it right after. I love the adjustable guard that it comes with, which means I won&#x27;t have to keep up with all the different sizes that my old one had (most of em I have misplaced.) The wall adapter has a light that indicates the trimmer is charging, but doesn&#x27;t have one that indicates that it is done charging. Not a big issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great value trimmer, especially for my needs.  It didn&#x27;t blow me away, but for $20, I was very satisfied with what I got. Even if it breaks down in a year, the money I save from not having to ask for a beard trim at the barber shop will still be worth the investment in this product.</li>
    <li> This one is a good one. I had the silver more expensive one until i left it in a hotel by accident. This is cheaper and takes longer to charge (about 10 hours!) HOWEVER, hoe many times in 10 hours are you shaving? I use it a few times, maybe 4 times on my face before it needs juice, then i just leave it plugged in overnight. next morning, bam, straight back into the dopp bag. Don&#x27;t waste money on the fast charging model unless you like that, or share it with lots of people, or are compelled to have an LED light in the handle.</li>
    <li> Had it for 3 months or so now - works just fine - no complaints</li>
    <li> It was okay until the top broke off. Felt like it was too cheap quality.</li>
    <li> Loved the first one and found that after a house guest left, the power cord disappeared.  Had to buy a second one since it has a proprietary cord.  For the price of a replacement cord plus a couple bucks, I have a lot of spare parts.</li>
    <li> Works great, the only flaw I have found in it is that if you press on the guard it will affect how deep the trimmer blade is. The dial adjustment is firm and does not change without moving the dial. The dial adjustment raises and lowers the guard on the opposite side as the trimmer blade is (far side as seen from the main image). But other than that I have satisfied for 2 weeks. The guard is also removable, to allow a much closer trim, but I have not tried that yet.</li>
    <li> Would be 5 star if you could use it while it&#x27;s plugged it. Wait for full charge.</li>
    <li> It works ok.  Issue is it is not that powerful or sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing is it has a decent battery life and is easy to take apart to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not the best trimmer out there, I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> works great, charge lasts a long time, not too bulky.</li>
    <li> So far so good, but I&#x27;ve had it only for two weeks - but it&#x27;s warranted for two years. I wanted something to trim my goatee to stubble length. This thing does the trick. It adjusts way down to less than 1/32nd of an inch. It&#x27;s very loud though.</li>
    <li> Gave this to a friend. He thinks it&#x27;s terrific.</li>
    <li> great trimmer.  battery lasts for ever on a single charge.  nice adjustment and guard.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive. Decent performer. While it feels a bit plastiky and light, I think that overall, it is a pretty good value. Functions fine. I like the dial selector for trimming height. I would recommend this model for people that don&#x27;t necessarily need it daily. If you need it all the time, I might select a heavier duty model.</li>
    <li> Great little unit for keeping your beard at a specific length which you select (I believe there are 6 levels but I&#x27;ve always just used the shortest 2 or 3 of those).</li>
    <li> This Philips Beard trimmer is a solid beard trimmer with a good design, intuitive length dial, and a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features at a glance:&lt;br /&gt;* Length dial controls the length of the beard comb, ranging from 1mm - 10mm, indicated with numbers 1 through 10.&lt;br /&gt;* Round edges of the blade is skin friendly.&lt;br /&gt;* Rechargeable via power cord - 35 minutes of use for 10 hour charge sounds about right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel of the trimmer - The trimmer doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy in the hand, which is great for those sessions that require more attention and time. Your hands won&#x27;t get tired. The length dial adjusts easily and locks in place. No loose dials/buttons. In the hand and against the face, this trimmer is very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design&lt;br /&gt;* The trimmer has a normal glossy black finish, nothing too fancy.&lt;br /&gt;* No LED lights, indicators, etc. Just a solid, bare-bone trimmer with a blue length dial with a white font.&lt;br /&gt;* The power button is of a push up and down mechanism. The switch-style design of the power ensures that you won&#x27;t accidentally hit a button.&lt;br /&gt;* The comb easily pops off for cleaning. Cleaning is straightforward and not a pain of a task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict - The QT4000/42 does exactly what it intends to - trim beard with ease, painlessly, &amp; with an array of lengths at your choosing. For the price and the versatility of its trimmer, it is tough to beat. Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  It ain&#x27;t fancy, but it gets the job done nicely.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves it. Would get him another in a heartbeat. His beard looks so sexy lately...</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer for two years and it does a great job. Easy to clean, it holds its charge well, and is a great shape and size.</li>
    <li> Like the feature of adjustable height without a bunch of extra parts.</li>
    <li> While I like it (can&#x27;t complain at this price), the shortest levels do sometimes have the trimmer creating little cuts in my skin. Close trimming is hence a little bit of a problem. However, it does decently well at all but the closest of levels and charges quickly.</li>
    <li> Straight forward beard trimmer without all the unnecesary gagets that come with so many others.  It works well and keeps my beard trimmed.</li>
    <li> These clippers replaced an old Remington set that I&#x27;d had for years. They seem to trim pretty close without any irritation (I use them instead of shaving; my face can&#x27;t take a razor), and it&#x27;s a consistent trim. The guide comb is a bit different from my last trimmer, so I was a bit surprised when my sideburns were almost gone after I tried to clean them up. I like the internal rechargeable battery, but it takes 10 hours to charge for 45 minutes of use. It also says not to use it in water, but I&#x27;ve used it in the shower (being sure to keep it out of the stream) and it appears fine so far. Time will tell how these hold up, but I recommend them.</li>
    <li> It works how I wanted it to, it trims great at different lengths, great price and easy to clean. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use once you figure out which setting to use. Fist time I cut my beard off. Use Highest setting and work down till you get the length you want. I would recommend getting 2 as my wife likes it too.</li>
    <li> 4 months ago, I bought this product. It still works pretty well. When I charge it, it lasts me for 2 weeks without charging it again. You also get a 2 year warranty. So basically you spend freaking 20 bucks for a product you can have for 2 years. Nothing less than 5 STARS!</li>
    <li> My son likes it very much so far no issue in a month</li>
    <li> The cutting length is pretty even. I like to use a 3 - I&#x27;d start with a higher number and work your way down until you achieve your desired stubble length. The plastic guard doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation so I can run it back and forth through my beard without hurting my skin.</li>
    <li> I was actually hoping that the adjustable length guide would allow for a longer beard length and was initially disappointed. However, it does a very good job of providing an even trim, and though the only settings useful to me is the &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; maximum, I&#x27;ve decided that&#x27;s good enough. Holds a charge for a long time, trims evenly and efficiently. If you&#x27;re into the stubble look, this is probably perfect for you.</li>
    <li> Good product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this product once and it&#x27;s already my favorite male grooming product based on quality, price, and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I haven&#x27;t downgraded this review, it has stood the test of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The turn dial to adjust the guide is what really puts this product over the edge.</li>
    <li> I recently re-grew my beard after a lapse of several years (where did that white come from?) and needed to neaten it up. The Philips Norelco had good reviews and a reasonable price. It comes with a dial setting on the clip length so you don&#x27;t have to switch guides. It&#x27;s small and light weight and best of all does a very nice job in getting an even length without pulling. The cutting ends are rounded so there&#x27;s no accidentally jabbing of the skin.  It cleans up easily. It has a 40 minute charge, which is fine for me since I&#x27;ll probably use it only once a week or so. I still use my electric razor (also a Norelco) to get a close shave on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all an excellent trimmer at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It advertise it as a \\&quot;beard trimmer\\&quot; which is specifically designed for your facial hair, but it is not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Philips QC5530 hair clipper, and I also have a Philips CC5060 baby hair clipper for my son. Put them together, except some difference on the shape, blade size, and the height-setting system, there is nothing different. It is extremely similar to the baby clipper just different color and again the height-setting system: the baby clipper is a comb which you adjust the height vertically, the QT4000 is that you rotate the circle. The blade is exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this expecting it act like a shaver which could hold the beard so that I do not need to clean the countertop and sink every time I use it, but I am wrong. It spread the beard everywhere and I need to clean the aftermath for 5+ minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While compare with QC5530 hair clipper, this QT4000 is not good in that it is NOT WHOLE BODY WASHABLE! So it is not safe to use it in shower room. For QC5530 although it also spread all the beard, I could use it in shower room when I take shower and just flush the hair away, with this, I have to use it in front of the countertop and clean the sink with paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing good is it is small and light weight, you may consider it if you travel a lot. Otherwise, for those who want to buy this, I recommend you consider QC5530. (it is wired as I check on Amazon now QC5530 is sold for $100+..I bought it for $25 and I think it just worth this money. Anyway, any one in QC55x0 series is a good way to go).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good, I&#x27;m getting this for the second time! (Only because I left the other one at my girlfriend place and shipping is going to cost me more than the actual cost of the product!)</li>
    <li> Far better (and less expensive) than my former Remington. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer for the bucks ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Not bad. But no charger. If it came with a charger, it would be fine. I&#x27;ve tried two, but neither fit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m somewhat &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; to a variety of electric shavers. Which is to say I had the same one for 6 years. Anyway, I use a shaver to completely obliterate any sign of unwanted hair in the moustache area, and around the corners of my mouth. My old shaver worked fine. This shaver, even when you take the guard off, still leaves an obvious sign of stubble. So now I use my roommates. I realize that the previous shaver I had did both (cut short on one setting and totally removed hair on the shortest setting) so maybe I&#x27;m spoiled but it would be nice if there was a way to know beforehand if this was that kind of &amp;#34;beard trimmer&amp;#34; or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really send back a $36 shaver I&#x27;ve used twice already, so it&#x27;s a real waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 62 and have had a mustache for about 30 years, but never a beard - until now. I had back surgery recently and post-op because of where the sutures were located it was very difficult to do the basic grooming essentials - teeth brushing, combing hair, and shaving. Any reaching, twisting, stretching, lifting, etc. was excruciating those first 3-4 days so I decided to ditch the task of shaving. Fast forward 3 weeks - the stitches are gone, I feel great, but now I have 20 days of growth on my face. I kind of like the rugged look I&#x27;m sporting and decide to keep it, but it needs some tidying up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I go on Amazon.com and look for a good beard trimmer - the trimmer I use for my mustache is a Wahl and very basic - no attachments and not really a way to regulate the length of my beard. I immediately spot this little item for under $20 and notice it has great reviews - and a lot of them. So I order it, it arrive 2 days late, and an hour ago I gave it a pretty good workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer works like a charm and after several experiments on trying to find the right length I&#x27;m happy to say my beard looks like it was trimmed professionally. I ended up using setting #4 which keeps my beard fairly closely cropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is idiot proof too. Once I settled on a proper length, it was easy as 1,2,3. The instructions clearly state to trim against the direction the whiskers are going and that&#x27;s exactly what I did. I have a uniform look everywhere - chin, cheeks, and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it was no different than shaving with my Phillips Norelco Sensor 3D which I guess will go on the shelf for the time being. Plus I&#x27;ve come to realize that by pulling this little jewel out of the drawer every 3 days or so maintaing this well groomed look is only going to take a few minutes of my time.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this to replace an older version that he had lost the charger for.  It works great and holds a charge for a good amount of time.  If he is happy - I am too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just recently been able to try growing a beard and I thought I should get a trimmer since stuff was just growing everywhere. The adjuster is easy to use and stays in place so you don&#x27;t have to worry that your hair is going to be too short.  Easy to operate power switch, charger is easy to use as well.  Comes with a little brush to clean the cutting head which is very easy to remove and replace.</li>
    <li> does not trim close - pulls on hair - just cheap product</li>
    <li> If you are bald and use this for your head - GET IT! Cheap, easy to use and simple. Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to keep my beard/mustache in order, and also to experiment with going a little bit longer between hair cuts.  I have been using this product for about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Battery life is good, ive had it on for at most an hour at a time and it hasn&#x27;t died on me yet. Razor itself cuts well.  No issues with cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  No problems bad enough to take a star off over considering the price.  Some extra finer attachments would be nice, maybe a nose trimmer.</li>
    <li> Have only used it twice but it functions very well and I like it the most of all the trimmers I have previously used.</li>
    <li> Good battery life, haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet.&lt;br /&gt;Several adjustments, but wish it had a bit finer adjustment or more options.  I like a relatively short beard/stubble look, 2 is a bit too short and 3 is a bit too long, halfway between would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if there were just another guard that was slightly thinner or thicker that could be considered a .5 adjustment in addition to the dial, that would be ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair tends to clog up under the guard, but it is easy to pull out and knock loose.</li>
    <li> The cutter screen does not stay on well.  It works OK for what it is and what it costs.</li>
    <li> does not shave as close as I like nothing beats a razor I returned this item.</li>
    <li> For $20 this Trimmer works pretty well.  Very long battery life, get about 20 shaves of the chin beard and sideburns I am sporting before needing recharge.  Cleans easy, adjustment mechanisim is simple to use.  If it broke I&#x27;d buy another.</li>
    <li> A very good trimmer for the money. I needed something simple and waterproof. This fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Works great,  I use it weekly to keep my beard trimmed.  I have been using it for over a month and it holds a charge well, no issues yet.</li>
    <li> Perfect sharp blades. Best part we can remove and clean in water. Its all stainless steel so no corrosion.&lt;br /&gt;I have very rough beard and its cuts thru smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;Definately, recommended to purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer especially the fact that the hair trimming adjuster is on the product itself which in my opinion is a pro. Over thr years, I&#x27;ve lost two sets of attachments which is why i opt to buy a trimmer like this. A con in the product is that with similar prices trimmers, you get a lot of different attachments like a nose trimmer that this trimmer doesnt come with.</li>
    <li> Great product.  No nonsense, no frills.  Does one thing very well.  Super easy maintenance.</li>
    <li> I replaced another trimmer that was going through batteries like mad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well.  The adjustable head is gimmicky, but works fine.  You can pop it off for trimming edges.  It&#x27;s a simple, but effective and relatively inexpensive tool that gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This product just happened to stop functioning a few days after the return period was over.  I would not recommend it to anybody.  The motor burned out or something as I can hear it trying but the blades do not move.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer especially for the price. I have owned numerous trimmers over the years and this one is definitely the nicest. I don&#x27;t ever spend a lot of money on them. My son purchased the high-end model of this trimmer and I loved the dial adjustment. This one has the same dial type adjustment and it works really nice. You can also pull the guard off in order to trim really short or whatever. Can&#x27;t talk about the durability as I haven&#x27;t used it a long time, but so far it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do, love the adjustment method. Not for you guys with longer beards, too short for my winter beard.</li>
    <li> Other trimmers have more accessories, but it works quite well on husband&#x27;s full beard.</li>
    <li> Even at the maximum length, this is not what I was looking for. It&#x27;s a good enough shaver, but has nothing that makes me say &amp;#34;Wow, I need to tell everyone about this&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just going for the &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; look, this is probably best for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago for my boyfriend, who likes to keep a beard. Thus far it has worked really well and he is pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer, even shave. Could use a holder, but no complaints with the actual product</li>
    <li> I used an old Conair for years, and I didn&#x27;t know there was anything better until my old razor finally gave out.  This trimmer is awesome, as I have sensitive skin and it does not nick you or pull hairs.</li>
    <li> Ordered this to replace an old Wahl that was losing it&#x27;s gusto. This thing does a wonderful job for an amazing value.</li>
    <li> The RPMs on the motor are very slow. Not sure exactly what they are because the specs don&#x27;t list them, but compared to my Panasonic shaver, which is 13,000 RPM motor, I&#x27;d estimate the motor on this unit moves about 1/3 as fast, which means the blades don&#x27;t move fast enough to cut the hair with any precision. The motor also doesn&#x27;t have much torque, so it is easy for it to bog down quickly.  I had to go over my face several times just to get an even cut. I recommend going with Wahl or Panasonic. This is not a good value.</li>
    <li> It is not met my expectation but it is good. I felt Philips Norelco G300 is better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> Not sure I like the combe, guess i&#x27;m just used to one that swivels,, other than that,, I do like this trimmer! for the money you can&#x27;t ask for more! it doesn&#x27;t snag your hair, and the battery last&#x27;s a good week of everyday use. The range of adjustment is great. And it is also easy to clean! I would recommend this trimmer to anyone. Only thing I wish I could change is the shipping,, Fed Ex is not the shipper of choice here! A choice of UPS would be nice!</li>
    <li> This is my second try on this item. First time through the battery died after about two months and would not accept a new charge. Amazon allowed me a return even after my return window expired, so I tried again. This time the battery died after about five weeks, again outside the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price the easiest thing to do is throw it way. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> so easy to use, and love all the settings without having to change heads. Gives a smooth trim with no pulling</li>
    <li> I use it about every other day.  Smooth and effective.</li>
    <li> Works fine, good for price.</li>
    <li> Nice little trimmer.  My pointy chin is very hard to shave clean with a razor so I went with a moustache and goatee.  She likes it so that&#x27;s a plus.  Anyway, it was a hassle to keep it trimmed short using the corded clipper I had with no attachments and a regular comb.  When the old trimmer finally gave out I decided to try this one based on other customers&#x27; reviews.  This trimmer does an excellent job and no cumbersome cord.  The adjustable settings work great and I like the fact that you can remove the trimmer&#x27;s comb for really close work.  Thank you Amazon for allowing us to post reviews and to the folks who have taken the time to write them.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> Good trimmer, does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> easy beard thingy, quick shipping and well priced.</li>
    <li> I have given in to the fact that these are disposable items.  I&#x27;ve tried expensive models, cheap models and different brands and battery types.  You&#x27;re lucky to get a 2 years or so.  I decided on this cheap model simply because I no longer want to spend very much on a trimmer like this.  I gave it a 10 hour charge and was pleasantly surprised with the shave.  It took a few passes but the hair became even and looked clean.  It also doesn&#x27;t make much sense to have the remove the flimsy trimmer head to clean it under water because the trimmer itself can&#x27;t get wet.  I don&#x27;t see that piece holding up.  I also love the fact that this model will run when plugged in.  Why it took Norelco this long to come up with that basic feature is beyond me.</li>
    <li> Works great. No detachable parts to get lost.</li>
    <li> This would be my first purchase for a beard trimmer.  Very easy to use, easy to adjust to use on my face.  There were so many different brands to choose from on Amazon and I am glad I went with this one.  It gets the job done every time!</li>
    <li> Works well as a basic hair trimmer; has five settings. Holds charge quite well.  Gets a lot of use and is going strong. Recommended!!</li>
    <li> The beard trimmer has met or exceeded expectations in reliability and ease of use. I would recommend it to others seeking an inexpensive trimmer that receives moderate use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t risk quality for the cheap price.  Has a wide range of lengths from short stubble to a pretty full length for your beard.  The battery life is exceptional and can go 10+ trims easy without showing a decrease in the blade frequency.  Pretty powerful.  Fits good in hand.  I&#x27;ll have this thing for a few years because it&#x27;s not cheaply made.  5 star product.</li>
    <li> A good trimmer. The battery life is quite sufficient. I like being able to adjust the depth right on the trimmer, rather then having to switch out combs (and keeping track of them!).</li>
    <li> Incredible price and it works really well. I have never tried a more expensive trimmer but this one works well for everything I need (beard/body). I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I probably shave once every few days, and this has been working great for the last year. The adjustable settings are at the perfect ranges.</li>
    <li> My son says works wonderful!</li>
    <li> My partner and I both keep relatively short beards. We&#x27;ve had this trimmer for months now, both use it twice a week, and it still works great. The adjustable settings are very accurate and it seems to be quality made. It holds a long charge. It holds the charge very well. Between the two of us using it we only have to fully charge once or twice a month.</li>
    <li> Unclear directions.  The blade came out and I can&#x27;t figure out how to put it back in.  In other words, a complete waste of money.  Used it once.</li>
    <li> Worked great, for less than a year, then broke. Unless you want to be spending $20s annually on replacing this cheapo product, I would recommend paying a little more for something that isn&#x27;t so fragile. Also the battery is very weak, loses a charge very easily. Even when plugged in, only works for 10 minutes before dieing.</li>
    <li> While this is not hair salon quality trimmer that slices through every hair on the first pass, it is a great value for those of us who don&#x27;t mind treating this like a 20 year old vacuum on shag carpet...&lt;br /&gt;The handy depth settings are great for adjusting from shaved-two-days-ago (setting 1) to I-shaved-last-week (setting 5) to I-manscape-my-beard-often (10). I just wish the longest setting was about twice as long, as I have a blonde beard and its perfect about 5 days after trimming it on a 10.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver takes a number of passes to get every hair. It does not nick or pull or tug or cut, but it takes its sweet time getting to each hair. I have found that the shorter the setting, the faster the trim.&lt;br /&gt;And for those of you looking for other-than-beard trimming, the handy guard does its job well - no accidental skin nips to be heard of.</li>
    <li> It is a very simple device but it works well.  The major drawback is a little wide to trim the beard.  The battery lasted three months before needing a charge. (I only use it to trim my beard about once a week.</li>
    <li> Works great. Charge lasts a long time. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Works very well! I&#x27;m still a little afraid to use it over the most private parts, but no issues so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable, so you never have to worry about buying batteries</li>
    <li> This thing is great. I have a full beard and I get a perfect and consistent trim every time. I&#x27;ve had it for two months and only had to charge it once so far. Very light in your hand and so simple a chimpanzee could use it. Great for the price.</li>
    <li> Battery seems to last for a good 2-3 trimmings.  Works fine for body trimming in sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say the packaging was damaged and the until was nicked, I returned it.  Might have worked out well, cannot say.</li>
    <li> I had to replace one because I was camping and I removed the head to clean and the little chrome thing that makes the blade move fell out and I was unable to find it. Tried to find the part and was unsuccessful even on your web site.  The old one falls out when you remove the head the new one stays put when you remove the head this is an improvement.</li>
    <li> Good one. But sometimes i get marks after using this. Once i wash my face with water it goes off.</li>
    <li> Very nice starter trimmer</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer!</li>
    <li> I like these. Simple and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Takes quite a few passes to get everything</li>
    <li> Its hard to switch on and off, the button is kind of rigid. Otherwise no hassle trimmer.</li>
    <li> Does what it is meant to do. If you are looking for a closer shave look for a Norelco sensotouch.</li>
    <li> Excellent product... Thank you</li>
    <li> Works well, battery last a long time.  Good product.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I wanted. Gives me that scruffy look I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This little beard trimmer is a very good buy for the price.  My only negative comment is that the shape of the comb causes hair to compact under the blade after a while.  That is easily corrected by taking the comb off and just wiping the hair away.  It did an excellent job on my beard and my hair, which I trim to the same short length.  Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to judge battery length.  I did have to take the head off when the motor seemed to be jamming.  Taking it off was easy; getting it back on the first time was not so easy.  After the first time no problem.  LATER:  This is a follow up to my initial review.  Battery length is fine BUT I reduced my review to three stars.  The head on the razor is a nuisance.  It requires frequent removal and cleaning of compacted hair.  I would recommend spending more money and getting a razor with a more convenient trimming head.</li>
    <li> Works great, and it lasts a good long while on a charge.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Has held a charge for over 10 trimmings already....and still going.</li>
    <li> Good but not great, will try another brand next.</li>
    <li> It works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> Much improved product.  To date meets all my needs.</li>
    <li> I use this on 2 and it works great. Leaves a short stubble. It&#x27;s tough to use after a shower while your skin is still not fully dry. It takes some work in areas where the hair lays down a different way but it gets there. Battery last for a week without issue.</li>
    <li> If you have a little bit of a longer beard and want this, please look elsewhere. Does not cut well at all. Had to go back to using my old one. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m passed my 30 day return window, too.</li>
    <li> Hated it .  It&#x27;s very difficult to shave with this piece was of crop.</li>
    <li> Pretty cheap price and trims my beard like a boss.</li>
    <li> Works great, stays charged for several trimmings at least, very complete instructions. Took me a while to figure out the angle to hold it against my face and which was the correct beard-length number, but those are the worst complaints.... Money well spent, I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> I chosed this product to trim my beard and other hairy parts on my body.&lt;br /&gt;It works good for tight trimming as well as for a bit longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the adjustable nozzle with various lengths since it allowed easy trimming of&lt;br /&gt;your preferred length. I also liked the long wire to the charger, very practical.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I disliked was the nozzle aswell since trimming long hair on the legs or&lt;br /&gt;stomach take a long time since the nozzle is round and pushed the hair away rather&lt;br /&gt;than raising it up for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with much or little hair on their body.</li>
    <li> An excellent trimmer, easy to use, light and maneuverable, very flexible settings and simple to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer does not capture every hair that is above a specific length, rather it just cuts those that stand up.&lt;br /&gt;So it works effectively, even if the user is sometimes frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;For detailed close in trimming, removing the trimmer stand off is easy. Exact trimming is possible that way, but of course the user must then be careful not to cut too much.&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts for several trimmings, so it works for travel even without the charger.</li>
    <li> It takes several passes to get this to cut my beard.  Hard to get a nice even trim.  It is light weight and inexpensive.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great product at a resonable price.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> The trimmer worked great for the first few months I had it but then it suddenly died. Height adjustments are easy. The shortest length gives you a decent stubble while the longest trims a decent length beard. I would have been happy with it for the price had it continued working.    Update: The thing magically started working again after a couple weeks of no response, so it appears I&#x27;m having battery issues similar to what other reviewers are reporting. I&#x27;ve moved my review up to three stars in hopes it continues to work for me.</li>
    <li> Glad to have a dedicated beard trimmer now. Does the job well.</li>
    <li> Very high quality product.</li>
    <li> Great shaver trimmer . Only thing pulls hair slightly but it&#x27;s cool . Great investment</li>
    <li> Its sturdy and looks cool. Good value for the price</li>
    <li> The trimmer has been a solid pairing with my electric razor to provide the casual beard look I prefer.</li>
    <li> Worked Great. Cannot complain about anything, snagged it for $20.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair trimmer I have ever used. I set it to the 2 or 3 setting for the scruffy stubbley look. Works like a charm every time.</li>
    <li> Great little powerful trimmer.  My only complaint is that there is nothing to catch the hair.  So you either get hair all over the bathroom counter or you use in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be a Stubble shaver as well as a beard groomer. As a result of the comb on the head, it actually prevents a stubble look and only works as a groomer. In fact, all of the Norelcos I have looked at have had the same type of comb. None of the featured stubble shavers functions as such, and you cannot obtain a stubble look.</li>
    <li> So for about 3 years I have been struggling to get the right shave. I had to shave at night to make sure the length was right, I always had to use my sideburn trimmer that left my beard either too short or to long. Now finally I took the plunge and I wouldn&#x27;t look back! Simple, nice and to the point. One 10 hour charge lasts me about 3/4 beard trims. Oh as a side note, I have very course stubble so I was surprised to not see this pull one hair.</li>
    <li> lightweight, easy to store, fast charging, clean shave!</li>
    <li> Not the best of the trimmers if you have a really tough beard and need a clean look.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer!  Lightweight, long-lasting batter, easy to use and clean.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> Stays charged for a long time.</li>
    <li> Good Product easy too use and god size.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon almost a year ago and have only had to charge it twice. The battery is impressive, to say the least. The shaver itself is very good but beware that it shaves very close, much closer than most other beard trimmers. If you like to keep your beard grown out much longer than the &#x27;haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days&#x27; look, then this is not the razor for you. The dial has 10 settings for length and the razor is very easy to use. It&#x27;s also good for trimming eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, quick dial adjustment&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic battery life - charged only twice in almost a year&lt;br /&gt;Small and lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Shaves extremely close - if you like a long beard this is NOT the razor you want</li>
    <li> The device is great and works well. Though the make is not rugged it serves my purpose well. Very good product in this price range.</li>
    <li> Husband love his beard trimmer. It is light in weight and has different setting for different desire length</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading a buch of reviews.  It&#x27;s really great. It&#x27;s solid, but inexpensive.  I like that the adjustment is on it and not a bunch if loose clip on attachments.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, and it extremely easy to clean after using.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Ok product.Battery is issue. Can remain till small time of 30/40 min.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and adjustability for bikini area!</li>
    <li> If battery is over, i can&#x27;t shave while it&#x27;s charging I must wait it charge..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No indicator that it&#x27;s fully charged...</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Fiance for Christmas, and he absolutely loves it. Works well, and does the job! He  purchased another when we moved from our last apartment since we miss placed the last one. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve received, and the only reason I ordered again was because I lost it when I moved.  Great, reliable product</li>
    <li> Its alright. It&#x27;s not the best, but pretty good!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Keep my bread trimmed and less cost for shaving blazes</li>
    <li> I got the Philips Norelco for my husband. He has tried many different trimmers and some he likes okay, some not so much. He was very impressed with the Phillips that I got him. He said that it works well and it has 10 different lengths, so you can choose which one works best for you. It didn&#x27;t irritate his skin, which is a big plus in his book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good trimmer and worked well.</li>
    <li> Long lasting battery life, greet price, great product</li>
    <li> This machine does its job. So I am satisfied with that. However there is one bad thing... The way its designed it makes it hard to shave sometimes.</li>
    <li> intermittent and broke with 2nd use.</li>
    <li> I got this to take on our family vacation because my son always forgets to take his shaver. It is very light weight and has 10 different settings. It hold a charge for a pretty long time, and is very easy to clean. Just run it under water and your good to go. We went to FL. and met some of my other relatives there, and it just so happened that my nephew needed to borrow it, and he raved about it. This is a very good beard trimmer for the  price.</li>
    <li> My husband grew a long beard this winter, and I was dreading his removing it. I had visions of hair and razors and mess.  I hesitated to use this because I thought it was only for beard trimming, not complete removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, we tried it and it worked almost as good as a regular electric shaver. Designed to work like a buzz cut trimmer, this simply took off strips of long hair, even two-inch chin lengths.  I was able to take off his entire beard in less than five minutes, leaving an almost perfectly smooth finish.  He just went back and did a quick regular razor shave to polish it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, what else you can do is even better: if you have a beard or want that constant stubble look, you can use this to keep the facial hair the same length all the time.  Just check the setting and it will continuously keep it at the mm that you want, so that it doesn&#x27;t grow too long past your \\&quot;ideal hunk\\&quot; length.  So you can keep a regular \\&quot;Don Johnson\\&quot; stubble thing going forever without it growing out, or manage a longer beard with it remaining the same all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also worked well to trim the beard down to a goatee and was fast and comfortable to use.  It doesn&#x27;t feel as solid as a regular electric shaver (sort of plasticy) but it worked better than expected.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Good product. Works as advertised, easy to use, and get the job done accurately. The clippings get all over the place, but that&#x27;s probably true for all beard trimmers. Glad I bought it, and great for the money.</li>
    <li> Sharp, cuts well, battery holds charge, overall as advertised. Had it for half a year now, and I trim my beird every week.</li>
    <li> I have worn a beard or goatee for the last 20 years. My old Wahl died so I started looking at the many different trimmers out there. I had one of the more expensive Wahl trimmers with all the attachments and was never happy with it. It was a real pain to change out the blades. The attachment with length settings was a 2 piece plastic piece of crap that felt like it could fall off at any moment.  I wanted a simple trimmer without a bunch of stuff I never use. This trimmer is exactly what I wanted and works extremely well. I&#x27;ve had it a little over a month and it is still on the first charge. You don&#x27;t leave this one plugged in all the time like other trimmers. There is no stand to store it in but that turns out to be better too. My old one gathered dust and trimmed hair and all the pieces would end up scattered all over the counter. I keep this one in a drawer when not charging and have more counter space.  It cuts very well and there are ample length settings to choose from.  I will update this review in a few months to see if it holds up.    1YEAR UPDATE  Still works perfectly. I&#x27;ve only had to charge it maybe 5 times over the last year.</li>
    <li> This s my favorite trimmer after 20 years of trimming my beard and trying a few different brands. Precise, long lasting battery and good price.</li>
    <li> Everything really good, great product!</li>
    <li> There is lots of different settings and all work very well! Great for a stubble look and more.</li>
    <li> It meets the user&#x27;s expectations. It&#x27; quick and gives good results. It came in time. It was value for money, after all.</li>
    <li> Perfect for trimming various lengths. I&#x27;ve tried a few others trimmers that were more expenisve and not as good. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is my first beard trimmer, I chose it because of previous reviews and so far I am happy with the product. It is a very simple, no-nonsense, easy to use, no frills machine. I only use it twice a week so I only charge the battery one a month, unless I&#x27;m taking it on a long trip. Small &amp; light as well. It works on any part of the body there is hair that is too long to shave.</li>
    <li> Great price and speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> Update Aug 29, 2013: I&#x27;m happy to say that everything in the review below continues to hold. The trimmer is holding up great after four months of almost daily use. The blades don&#x27;t seem to have dulled (I never feel my hairs getting violently ripped from my face). The unit still holds enough charge to get me through the week.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t address in the original review is that the guard comes off very easily so it&#x27;s an easy unit to clean. All-in-all, a great product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco QT4000 is a perfectly decent beard and mustache trimmer if you&#x27;re looking for something that does the job without any frills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design makes it difficult to get an extremely close shave but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s built for. The shortest settings gives my beard and mustache a nice scruffy look without being too long and looking ragged. The trim is even in length and the best part, for me, is that it manages to get the hair on my lower neck which my previous two trimmers always had trouble trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never run the trimmer down to zero charge but regularly get a week&#x27;s worth of quick trims without any decline in the quality. To recharge I just plug it in when I remember and it&#x27;s always ready to go the next time. There is no external light or indicator of how much charge is left but it&#x27;s never been an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger itself is a lightweight wall plug and the cord itself is a very generous 6&#x27; (feet) in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, while there is nothing about this trimmer that makes me say, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot; it&#x27;s perfectly good for its price and has not failed me yet. I would not hesitate to recommend it to someone.</li>
    <li> Clicking adjustments works well, no attachments to loose.. We&#x27;ll as long as you leave it on. Only issue preventing me from giving is 5 stars is that when trimming with out the height adjuster - meaning height of zero it&#x27;s not quite as tight as others.  But hey at that point I probably need to shave. The charger also doesn&#x27;t auto turn off, but I only charge it about once a week for 12 hours.</li>
    <li> This is great for trimming a beard. I love that the length changes with a simple rotation instead of changing heads. Battery has held up for a week now.</li>
    <li> nothing special, but you do get a reasonable trimmer for a reasonable price. The 0 shave isnt as close as i would have liked but in all honesty it works fine</li>
    <li> Really a nice one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and safe. Does what its designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy and use it to experience it.</li>
    <li> Decent trimmer for the price. This trimmer will meet most of everyone&#x27;s needs. So far I have been satisfied with the battery life, which covers basic grooming needs. Now when we talk about the charger, they could have included a small base to charge the trimmer. The trimmers adjustable hair length guide could also use a little bit more thought. It is only supported at one point as it moves up and down during adjustment. This &amp;#34;good idea bad execution&amp;#34; results in an inaccurate guide, as the plastic guide bends in with varing pressure. As one would encounter while trimming ones face. Overall decent beard trimmer, for the price.</li>
    <li> This shaver works pretty ok for me. Although i feel it&#x27;s quite a struggle to line my beards with this.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great and the battery charge lasts for a very long time. Gives a nice even trim and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I got this for my son who has been shaving for 2 years now.  He has an electric razor but keeps his beard long.  Neither of us like how long his beard would get, so I got him this to keep it neat looking. It does a great job.  He has had no problems using it.  It doesn&#x27;t catch or nick him at all.  Flawless.</li>
    <li> I have tried many beard trimmers and this unit compares favorably to most of them.  It&#x27;s solidly made and intuitively designed.  It&#x27;s rechargeable and holds a charge for weeks under average use.  Handy for trimming other areas as well!  It&#x27;s not going to replace my corded clipper but when you need something small this is a great unit.</li>
    <li> I love this beard trimmer; it is incredibly durable, is made of sturdy material and does not get dirty easily. When it does get dirty, it is super easy to clean. The settings are customizable, and the trimmer itself does a good job of getting hairs. The blade is sharp and does not dull easily, I have found. Charge lasts a long time, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep a charge</li>
    <li> My husband loves it .Great price and does what it says .</li>
    <li> I had a 3 inch beard, this trimmed it down on the #8 setting perfectly.</li>
    <li> Works great but the charging instructions are a concern. You have to let the battery die before recharging and can&#x27;t charge more then ten hours. I have another razor that I charge when every I want to and the battery has lasted fine for the last three years now.</li>
    <li> The clippers appear to be well-designed. The adjustment wheel works as advertised and the guard can easily be removed for cleaning. However, a critical design flaw limits the effectiveness of this product. The guard length is adjusted by the wheel. However, it is made of a flimsy plastic that doesn&#x27;t resist pressure. The result is an incredibly uneven and patchy trim across the face where pressure was applied variably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used these clippers I had to shave my entire beard as there were spots that were nearly missing. Even now, conscious of this issue and making my best effort to avoid it, I am often unable to get an even length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this seems like a convenient product, I would certainly never buy it again and will probably stick to trimmers with interchangeable clipper guards moving forward.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer! For someone, like me, who&#x27;s in need of a fairly basic trimmer, this is perfect. That said, the 10 trimming lengths provide more than enough personalization, and I use it to trim my beard and shave my head on occasion. I love that it&#x27;s adjustable with only one attachment (I got sick of hauling around all of the extra nose-trimmer, beard-trimming, and head-trimming attachments from my past Norelco). Bottom line: easy to handle, easy to clean, and very versatile: for $20 it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> Works better than the conair beard trimmer I had previously. Easily cleaned and the instructions for maintaining battery life was important to me.  Register the product on their website and get an extended warranty for free.</li>
    <li> Next best thing to using a razor, can be used with or without the cord,  lightweight and adjustable</li>
    <li> READ THE LEGAL WARNING. The charger is not included and I have yet to find a charger that fits this trimmer. Even if you look for the specific model number, places will sell a charger that is similar but does not fit.  Opt for a more expensive trimmer that includes a charger or a different company. When I bought the trimmer the multiple &#x27;legal warnings&#x27; were not on the product&#x27;s page.</li>
    <li> Not the best trimmer ever, misses longer hairs and takes much longer to get an even trim.</li>
    <li> the small piece inside doesnt stay in- causing the electric razor to malfunction.  This razor works great; when its working  You have to constantly open it back up and put the piece where its suppost to stay-  I am assuming I just got unlucky with this one-  Great shave before malfunctioning piece-</li>
    <li> Exactly what he wanted. It&#x27;s sleek and quiet and it trims just as expected.</li>
    <li> Pretty good and affordable. The trimmed hair does have sharp ends after using this product. Just FYI.</li>
    <li> Seems like a low quality product, but it&#x27;s probably good at the price point.</li>
    <li> For a low price it does a great job</li>
    <li> Great product. Great deal. Serves its purpose</li>
    <li> Good product, a little on the cheap side (what you paid) but does get the job done.</li>
    <li> It trims hair.  I don&#x27;t know what more you could ask for. The battery lasts long enough to go a few days worth of trimming with no problem.  Though I&#x27;m no sasquatch, it is sufficient for my purposes.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked well for about 4 months and now it won&#x27;t stay charged. The last few times I used it repeatedly died and I had to stop to plug it in multiple times in order to finish shaving.</li>
    <li> This works awsome. I used to shave every day now, I just use this trimmer and I always have a five a clock shadow. The battery life&#x27;s not the best but who cares I normally have it plugged in anyway.</li>
    <li> Works great  easy to adjusted easy to clean and a great price.</li>
    <li> Love it! Keeps my beard and mustache neat. My only complaint would be that it should have come with a case to protect it.</li>
    <li> The product and the shipment was exactly as described. Excellent product - the different settings are easier to control, very easy to clean and the result is really good - you can even get the evening shadow look can easily</li>
    <li> 1. The blades are sharp and cut cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;2. As advertised, no separate attachments are needed to make quick adjustments in cutting length.&lt;br /&gt;3. Battery is strong but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough for a full review.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer, compact easy height adjustments holds charge well.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. It keeps his beard from looking straggly and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my beard, and I found it to work very well.  It is very easy to clean because the plastic comb is removable.  The length adjustment is very easy to use as well.  The battery lasts a long time, too.  After I shaved my beard, I thought I would stop using it, but I was wrong.  When my neck, sideburns, or other places start getting overgrown, my wife or I use it to keep the manly forest at bay.</li>
    <li> I like the stubble look, and this razor works perfectly.  I charge it once a week and shave every other day.</li>
    <li> get u ready for valentines day</li>
    <li> This product works really well and keep a really good charge!</li>
    <li> Good value, quick delivery. Works well.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer! I use this to get the 1/4 inch beard length my work requires! Charge lasts a for a couple weeks if you only use it to trim a couple times a week! Awesome product</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer that gives a great shave. So why the bad rating? You&#x27;ll never be able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not one, but two of these things, both of them have broken chargers. Both chargers worked one time and then broke. I contacted customer support not once, but twice, and BOTH times they sent me the wrong chargers. I&#x27;m serious, I&#x27;m sitting here with two dead shavers, two dead chargers, and two chargers for completely different trimmers which I have no use for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the trimmer itself if I could just SOMEHOW get my hands on something to charge it with I would be SO happy, but no luck. I&#x27;ve just got a big pile of useless junk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen beard trimmers that go for shorter lengths. But still, the beard looks good.</li>
    <li> Everything I wanted at a great price.</li>
    <li> It does the job. I would have gave it 5 stars, but you have to do a bunch of passes in order to get an even trim.</li>
    <li> This gas been a Great beard trimmer for me, the adjustable head works better than I expected and I use a 1..</li>
    <li> Easy to use and my beard is keep neat and trim at all times.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is amazing, both in price and in operation.  Most of the time I use it mainly for keeping my beard looking clean and even.  However, as a tool to do &#x27;styling&#x27; performance is poor, I had to go back over with a razor because it doesn&#x27;t cut close.  Another fact I believe is worth sharing is that I was able to give myself a buzz cut, despite my very thick hair and its length.  A big thing is that it has a good battery life but if it dies mid-shave/trim then it will take a long time to get up enough charge to finish.</li>
    <li> It is not what I expected. Does not do the job as good as the last one I had. Is not very accurate on depth</li>
    <li> works well.  keeps my beard in check and allows me to easily change the height.</li>
    <li> tiny and powerful and at a great price</li>
    <li> This trimmer is just so-so. I don&#x27;t really like the &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; thing. It makes it hard to make the hair go in it. I&#x27;m not explaining it right but unless your beard is really long and your trying to trim a lot off of it, it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I am 16 and just wanted to have a 5 O&#x27;clock shadow beard. This can help you achieve that if you use it right. Takes some practice but you&#x27;ll look great for anything. I used this to do a fade on my sideburns too ! I actually didn&#x27;t know the clipper came off till I accidentally pulled it off and this makes this product 10x&#x27;s better now! Great bargain trimmer.</li>
    <li> looking at the price you wouldnt expect this to be as efficient as it is. It is a sleek trimmer that with no effort cut through my beard. Very easy to adjust, Very easy to maintain, And can do it all from evening out hair to turning it into a fine stubble. I would recommend this to anyone. Good show Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;durability: 8/10&lt;br /&gt;efficiency: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;weight: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;battery life: 4/10 (the only design flaw in my opinion)</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer is very light and comfortable. The adjustments provide a good range of trim length for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the charge last for several uses (10 - 12?), the 10 hours of recharge time are a drawback when you suddenly realize that the charge has run down. I have a rechargeable razor that can operate from the charger when it runs out of juice; this one cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the above issue, I like this product.</li>
    <li> Pretty good machine.&lt;br /&gt;Performs as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Construction seems flimsy, though.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like it is not built to last.&lt;br /&gt;But great value for the price</li>
    <li> Had an older version that lasted for years - - love this thing for keepin my junk touchable!  Great value!</li>
    <li> When I asked for this for Christmas, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be as good as I hoped it would. As it turns out, I like it quite a lot. I like the stubble look and this keeps it trimmed easily and quickly. For longer hair, it wouldn&#x27;t be very accurate, and it does make a little bit of a mess. Other than that, it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it for years to come.</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about this trimmer.  It performs as advertised. It would have been a better product if a small detail trimmer was attached to the unit.</li>
    <li> I just started to grow a beard a few months ago and went to Amazon to determine which trimmer to buy.  I have no complaints with this trimmer.  It works great and as advertised.  I&#x27;ve found that it only works by battery power and won&#x27;t run off of electrical power from the chord when it&#x27;s plugged in.  Not a big deal but would be nice if it did.</li>
    <li> Do not get this. If you are a guy with thick facial hair, this is not the trimmer for you. A $15-$20 beard trimmer is a $15-$20 beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> This item works great it is pretty cool and nice charges for 10 hours but other then that it is nice</li>
    <li> This thing is so easy to use easy to set the high according to how close of a shaved if you want easy to clean it is easy is perfect for me</li>
    <li> My husband decided to grow a beard last year......first time ever......and it is really quite handsome on him.  He was using his old hair trimmer to shape it so for his birthday I bought him this beard trimmer.  I made my choice based on reviews of other trimmers since I had no idea how to judge a beard trimmer.  I am happy to say he loves it.  It is of course much easier to use than hair trimmers but he liked the size, the weight, and how easy it was to shape his beard just right!!  Of course I am happy he is happy!!!</li>
    <li> Worked for less than a year and now won&#x27;t even keep charge worked well while it lasted...........</li>
    <li> Really good, trims well enough. It has various settings. The short battery life sounds ridiculous at first, but it makes sense since you barely use it long enough to waste it all on one go. Recharging takes a long time.</li>
    <li> Alert:  As I am a woman and do not sport a beard (no wise remarks, please), I asked my favorite husband to try this out. These are his observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I really like this trimmer. I waited a few extra days before trimming my beard so that the hair would be longer (and pokier - the wife). When the trimmer arrived, I plugged it in and let it charge overnight. It has very sharp blades, and the guides kept it from cutting or scraping me while I cut my beard.  The handiest part is that the guides are built into the trimmer. There are plenty of adjustments (10) so that I can decide exactly how long I want to leave my beard or stubble, if that&#x27;s what I want. The battery lasts a very long time; plenty long so that I can trim my beard several times. The trimmer itself is very lightweight compared to my plug-in trimmers, too. On a scale of one to five, I give it a five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the wife:  I&#x27;m glad that he likes the trimmer. It&#x27;s a wonderful gift.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco QT4000/42 is a decent travel size beard trimmer. It&#x27;s small to be left in a toiletry bag and yet has a nice weight to it for precision trimming. The build quality is great and it looks like it can endure some abuse in the toiletry bag. It has 10 settings for different beard length from 1/32\\&quot; to 13/64\\&quot;. The parts can be pulled out for cleaning. I simply put them under running water. I also like the trimming blade has rounded tips so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good trimmer given its price point. It cuts sharply without pulling my beard. it&#x27;s comfortable to use. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it takes 10 hours to charge for a 35 minute runtime. The next model up (QT4014) takes only 1 hour to charge for a 50 minute runtime. That&#x27;s rather extreme in terms of the charging times. Anyhow, I just have to remember to plug it in after each use. That&#x27;s nothing worst than having the battery die in the middle of a trimming session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$25 for a cordless beard trimmer that works well and can withstand some abuse with its 2-year warranty. That&#x27;s a pretty good product to be had.</li>
    <li> It is really awkward to shave with and the comb dose not seem to work well. Also it dose not work well if you want your beard any longer than 1/4 of an inch :(</li>
    <li> Superb trimmer.  Easy to use and does the job!</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to, but does a great job trimming the beard.  Not meant for long beards, but short ones it is great.</li>
    <li> Took a little while but I have it</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the $$</li>
    <li> He said it did all the things he needed it to.  It was easy to adjust for all of his manscaping needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because the longest beard setting isn&#x27;t all that long.. But if you don&#x27;t grow your beard long, this will be perfect😊</li>
    <li> Works great - and SUPER results.  Best one I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive but does the job.  Simple to use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace an older model.  This one works just fine.  The depth adjustment on this model is a little more sophisticated in that it adjusts with a knob while the older model moved in an out by being pulled on by hand.  This design might be a little more secure and I think it allows a longer cut.  However, when fully removed for cleaning, the guard is a little tricky to reinstall.  With practice, this is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this model, the clipping mechanism can be completely removed for wet cleaning. Reinstalling it is also tricky and takes patience and practice.  The older model was hinged and had to be dry cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older model had a holder / charger and was constantly charged.  That might shorten the life of the battery.  This one has a separate wall wart charger and wire/plug that is typically stored away when not in use.  The instructions indicate that the razor should occasionally be completely discharge to extend the life of the battery.</li>
    <li> Simple and gets the job done, rinse it every so often during your shave ;)</li>
    <li> Thoroughly pleased with this product! It&#x27;s been a life saver for sure :)</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer is a great performer. I have owned this product for 6 months now and never had any problems with it. The shape, size, power of the trimmer and the ability to recharge it are all desirable features. I stick with one length for my beard so I don&#x27;t deviant much in the different levels. However, turning the blue middle piece is easy for anyone that wants to adjust the levels. I really like that it has the ability to recharge (saves money on batteries) and the charges last like 7-10 shaves for me before I have to put the cord back on it. Plus if you remove the plastic level piece and shave with just the trimmer you get a closer shave, there is no irritation.Overall, I am very happy and will continue using this trimmer.</li>
    <li> Battery runs out pretty quickly trims close though...</li>
    <li> So far so good. Holds the charge really well and its not rough on my skin.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer, have been using it for quite sometime now; works flawlessly</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. Easy to use, easy to clean, nice even trim on any setting.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I need it to do. Simple, works, easy to adjust size. Battery seems to last for multiple shaves. Nothing fancy</li>
    <li> great product, great price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a excellent trimmer, battery keep long time and work well.</li>
    <li> Got it as a starter shaver for my 17 year old brother. He loves it. Perfect for him, but he doesnt have much to shave yet so it hasnt been put to the test. But i like the fact that it doesnt have a bunch of attachments to it that will eventually get lost, its all connected. Overall i would recommend and buy it again.</li>
    <li> This shaver is absolutely terrible .</li>
    <li> Great product.. Price is right and serves its purpose</li>
    <li> This will be a functional beard trimmer for about a year and half before you start to see signs of failure, i bought mine at a walmart 2 years ago. the spinning dial works well and the top slides into and out of place easily while also being secure when in place. the only thing besides instructions that comes in the packaging is the trimmer with guide in place and the charger. its great works well strong motor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ONE EXCEPTION- CLEANING- as i used my trimmer i would detach the blades and clean them along with the spindle inside the trimmer, after about a year i decided to fully clean the trimmer by running some water through the blades. I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST DOING THIS immediately after i did the blades were not as smooth and the spindle was not as \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; as when i got it. the reason being that the lubrication on the blades was washed away . the trimmer does not come with lubrication fluid or a cleaning brush, being in college when i had this trimmer i had some aerosol cooking spray that i was able to use to re-lubricate the trimmer and got about another year out of the trimmer (with a cleaning and re spraying every month and half or so). now two years later the motor quits when you rotate the trimer and the blades stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth buying for 20 dollars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was on amazon looking for a new trimmer and saw this one and decided to leave a review, i would buy again and might go back but i want to see what else is out there for 10-15 dollars more</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and a great price.</li>
    <li> easy to use and maintain. great trim that surpassed my expectations. great adjustable modes for different trim lengths and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for my beard, it was recommended by my gastroenterologist, It worked better then I had hoped it would.</li>
    <li> I tried many beard trimmers and this was the one i think works the best.  Works longer without charging than the others ive tried.</li>
    <li> This is a simple cheap little trimmer that works just fine for me.  For 4 months I have used it every other day or so with very minimal charging to trim my goatee and shave my head (the 50% of hair thats there anyway).  I probably charge it every other week or so even though it may not need to be charged.  Yeah, there are no bells and whistles (auto charging lights, etc.) but for as cheap as it is and if it works for a couple of years, I&#x27;m ahead of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars for a cheap product is a no brainer.  To get 5 stars from me, something has to really &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me and that ain&#x27;t gonna happen for a $20 trimmer!</li>
    <li> use it once a week to trim the beard.  Great product and when i need another one wont hesitate to buy again</li>
    <li> My husband says:&lt;br /&gt;Serves its purpose.  Simple and easy to use.  Very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man of few words :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say:&lt;br /&gt;he uses it everyday and seems to love it.</li>
    <li> The price was low and the quality is good.  Been using for several months on the same charge.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have a beard that grows in some strange ways, and tends to lay down - this trimmer struggles mightily with that, and it often takes me a long time and several passes to do a routine trim.  It holds a charge for quite a while, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> works as expected, cheaper than going to the barber.Please purchase you will not be sorry I promise. This is my second purchase as I also needed one for the office.</li>
    <li> as described and advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take care in trimming. use a setting above what you want to make sure you don&#x27;t cut too short. depending on how you angle the trimmer against your beard i&#x27;ve found that it may cut too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise a great product.</li>
    <li> I simply put it on number 2 and it trims my goatee nice and evenly. I love it. Just remember, don&#x27;t press it too hard against your chin, since it can trim too close.</li>
    <li> This thing trims just fine, but it throws the cut hair all over the room.  Pay a little more and get one with the \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; feature.  (This review provided by Grace&#x27;s husband.)</li>
    <li> Read the directions, easy to use, holds a charge,fool proof, and predictable! Very happy with this for trimming my beard accurately. Cleaning is a breeze too!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product.  Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;- I have sensitive skin, and using this product seems to minimize the irritation and redness that often accompanies a shave/trim.&lt;br /&gt;- A lot of different options built-in, without the aggravation of using different attachments.&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to be very durable, I expect it to last years.&lt;br /&gt;- Simple to handle and clean.&lt;br /&gt;- When used daily, it will last about two weeks and then needs charged (can be fully recharged overnight).</li>
    <li> My husband just grew a beard and this is a difficult product to use - should be more instructions included.</li>
    <li> I have gone through so many beard trimmers at this point - I keep my beard very short, and have found that most (despite any level of care) either bust quickly, hurt, or both. This has been great. It was so annoying having to spend more time - ironically - trimming a simple short beard than shaving; finally I don&#x27;t have to worry about that problem without spending too much on it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the trimmer recharge. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a defective trimmer or not, but be warned, you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Awesome product.. Charging lasts really long. Used more than 5 times by single time charging.</li>
    <li> I have used many but this one stands out</li>
    <li> Works great.  There&#x27;s only 2 buttons, which are very self explanatory, and there are only 2 pieces that come off to clean.  Both of those are tool-less, and intuitive.  My beard kicks ass au-naturel, cave man style.  But my wife insists on grooming.  If you&#x27;re wife feels the same way, this thing is as good as it gets.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  I like to keep a short stubble, the &amp;#34;4 days since I last shaved&amp;#34; look.  With this set on level 3 it gives me just what I want.  It&#x27;s adjustable for different lengths, just turn the little blue dial.  Being rechargable it&#x27;s very convenient to use.  Easy to clean as well.... highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was going to get the 5000 but got this one instead. I was worried about battery life as it turns out, the battery will last me a couple of days. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Having gown mustache and beards over the years I needed something light and easy to use.  This trimmer fits that bill and does everything very nicely but not quietly.</li>
    <li> Product works great and is very simple to use.  Comes with a charge so you can use out of box.</li>
    <li> Worked ok for about 6 months, then started to fade. It is now a year old and useless.</li>
    <li> After I charged the unit I used it and it work as promised. Easy to adjust height of clipper guard and a breeze to clean. Nice even trim and the charge last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is an all right product. It died after a little less than a year. I think it does work well while it lasts. It has a lot of options for trimming your beard with what length you desire it to be.</li>
    <li> At first I thought the guard didn&#x27;t come off, but it does. It serves its purpose, but will have to see after time if the battery last as long as my other one did.</li>
    <li> No problems what so ever...</li>
    <li> I owned a Remington that worked well and was only a little higher in price, but the battery died prematurely so I bought this Norelco.  It&#x27;s smaller and lacks heft and is clearly of poorer quality.  Not as many closeness settings and don&#x27;t get a consistent trim.</li>
    <li> I thought I would surprise my husband with a new beard trimmer since his was old - he absolutely loves it! it keeps a good charge and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This is very well designed and light weight trimmer for the low price! I&#x27;ve used three different styled trimmers in the past and this one is by far my favorite. I&#x27;ve used a heavy bottom weighted adjustable trimmer w/ a vacuum, multi-attachments trimmers and a basic dirt cheap adjustable trimmer. I spent  at least 10 minutes trimming with those!! It was a hassle. I was done in 3-5 minutes (Didn&#x27;t track my time. If I update this I will include it then) at most. It worked right out of the box! Like I said before, it&#x27;s light weight but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. Your arm doesn&#x27;t get tired like other heavier models might do. Also, IT IS AN EVEN TRIM!!!!!!! The last trimmer I had was very rough against the skin and trimmed so unevenly that I looked like a bum lmao So for $20, I am very very very happy!</li>
    <li> The part that makes this adjustable is a ridiculously flimsy plastic piece that flexes so much that the distance between the guard and the blade can change 1/8&amp;#34;...and that&#x27;s using light pressure. This makes it utterly useless for anything but taking general hacks out of your hair.</li>
    <li> This thing is like a ferrari for my mustache</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now had this trimmer for over a year, I still give it a 5 star rating. It&#x27;s great for the price.I like the many height adjustments. Wish it had a compartment to gather the whiskers.</li>
    <li> Works well stays charged just as reported</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought &amp; junked a lot of trimmers in the last few years. This has so far, been the and least expensive of them all. I am very happy with this and will most likely be buying another one for my &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; beard.</li>
    <li> It was good but it stopped working after less than a year.  The height of the blade no longer goes up or down so unless you want to permanently set your beard length to zero, I would skip it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good beard trimmer. Not great for lining up but good for trimming.</li>
    <li> A pretty good trimmer, does what I expected it to do, and at a very decent price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my hair which is undercut (think Ellie Goulding). I really like how the guard is integrated with the system, I didn&#x27;t want a bunch of extra junk in my bathroom, it&#x27;s simple to adjust and I usually use the 10 setting which around a quarter of an inch. I only use it once a week and I have only had to charge it once. Cleaning is easy and the blades seem to be nice and sharp. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a closer shave, I cant imagine trying to trim a beard with it since the guard doesn&#x27;t go far out, you would have to free hand it essentially. Over all happy with the purchase and am waiting for my BF to steal it from me because its nicer than his.</li>
    <li> I really have no qualms about this product. The great thing about it is, if you have any sense about you, you&#x27;ll be able to use the trimmer. I use it for body hair and it does wonders. The controls on it are incredibly user-friendly and if it were up to me, I&#x27;d just send the trimmer out to people and skip the manual altogether in order to save paper. There&#x27;s really been no difficulties for me other than when I took the guard off and knicked my skin but that&#x27;s my own fault and definitely isn&#x27;t the trimmer&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I like that the guard is connected and you can increase the length easily. It doesn&#x27;t need to stay plugged in to work. Wish I still had it! Lost the guard part a while back. Would have bought another had I not needed one the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought for my son to trim his beard. He likes it.</li>
    <li> The best Trimmer i bought. What i like about it most is the battery life. My other trimmers would die after like 2-3 shaves. With this one i can get in like 6 shaves before it dies on me.</li>
    <li> For the pice, I don&#x27;t know if there is anything out there better than this trimmer. The built in comb cap makes adjusting length extremely easy and keeps the extra pieces to a minimum. You won&#x27;t loose any specific measurements since they are all attached! Another good thing about it is that it charges quickly and lasts for a good amount of time on battery. Nothing is worse that starting your shave and not being to make it all the way through due to the battery dying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have had clumps of hair get stuck under the comb and that it is a little hard to trim straight lines due to the comb blocking my view. The good thing is though that the comb comes off easily so I can remove the hair in a matter of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would highly suggest buying this trimmer if you are looking for convenience, something that works great, and if you are not wanting to drop a pile of cash on something else that does the exact same thing but is more &amp;#34;stylish&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The length setting is precise and secure. Thumb wheel works well. Never pulls.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that works comfortably.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted. While sure, it does miss an led to indicate when the charging is completed, that&#x27;s hardly a big deal.</li>
    <li> works great, hold a charge for a long time- no issues</li>
    <li> The cuts are sharp and crisp, and cutter heights are easily adjusted. Its compact design makes it easy to pack for trips. The battery charge lasts every bit as much as advertised. One caveat -- my desired beard length is right at the upper edge of the adjustment... for those desiring lengths longer than the stated maximum, this may not be the trimmer for you.</li>
    <li> First time beard grower...dug how simple this was to use. Adjustable click wheel is great. No more losing those snap on parts.</li>
    <li> My trimmer was mailed very fast , and so far it has been working like a charm, I like it a lot....</li>
    <li> Has so many settings and it is a very exact razor. You can go from a little stubble to full beard. I do not think my beard has ever looked better.</li>
    <li> Blade and settings were great, but battery died after a year. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite beard trimmer and when his broke I bought him a new one.  He loves it!!</li>
    <li> It was good except that the minimum should be zero</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work properly not shave effectively....you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Worked one time, then it died.  Junk.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  For the price,  quality and purpose is excellent. Highly recommended for this range.</li>
    <li> Does not hold a charge for the advertised 45 minutes.  If I charge this overnight, I still only get about 1 minute and 30 seconds before the battery dies.  Wish I bought a different trimmer.</li>
    <li> Got it at a great price and it works like a charm. I would prefer a closer shave however.</li>
    <li> Ok, kind of cheaply made.</li>
    <li> The perfect beard trimmer if I could only remove the comb to trim close around the lips.</li>
    <li> This machine is exactly what you need. I am really happy with this. unbelievable the quality of it. I really recommend it. I love My machine.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I feel like a new man.! every morning.!</li>
    <li> This simple contraption works well. It&#x27;s intuitive, east-to-clean, leaves an even trim, and reliable. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in if the battery is dead. In other words, the power cord only charges the trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t provide it with power.</li>
    <li> My old electric trimmer was dying and for the price I really wish I bought this sooner.</li>
    <li> O.K. for use with comb.  Not to good after removing comb for trimming around lips</li>
    <li> Great price, small, and has fantastic battery life. Made me think about facial hair in a whole new light, great product!</li>
    <li> Darn good price for product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, easy to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable, glides easily and has fantastic range settings. Never tangles with short/long beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is fantastic even with constant use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars simply because nothing is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great buy. Won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Purchased the trimmer to do touch up work. It is easy to work with and does a great job. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Battery dies too fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll have to pat myself on the back for finding this product at a reasonable price and experiencing great results. In simple words, I&#x27;m one happy camper and this trimmer does an outstanding job. The adjustable depth control works as advertised and is a great feature. I was a bit skeptical of the adjustment feature prior to purchase, but now I&#x27;m convinced of it&#x27;s ability to provide a uniform beard depth.</li>
    <li> I used another Philips for two years and was happy and just decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to this one. Used it for 2 weeks and sent it back. It feels cheap, it&#x27;s not flexible and is hard on your skin. It&#x27;s alright, but I didn&#x27;t keep it.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer for only 20$. Worth it if you need a inexpensive trimmer.</li>
    <li> If you want to trim your beard it&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s not good too completely remove it.</li>
    <li> This is my first beard trimmer, and it appears to work very well.  The dial settings work well and give plenty of versatility.  I&#x27;ve used #3 to keep trimmed to a short beard.  I have charged it up once and used it every day for a couple of weeks without loosing any power.</li>
    <li> The product is very satisfactory for the price. It takes a bit of time to get a close shave, but it does a much better job of removing a lot of hair at once than a disposable razor would. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone looking for a close, not necessarily precise shave.</li>
    <li> replaced an older Norelco trimmer that fell and broke.  The dial adjustment is great, no attachments to loose.  Trims and creates a neat look as would be expected.  great product.</li>
    <li> Useful to keep the beard at that length that your girlfriend loves it. Works great. I just won&#x27;t give it 5 stars because hair gets spilled everywhere while using it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had purchased one of these years ago.  Makes it easy to trim my beard.  Lots of settings for different hair lengths.</li>
    <li> And it worked perfectly for me. I hate using my old razor now because this thing never cuts me when I use it, and gives me the stubble I want. I haven&#x27;t tried using it at settings much different than just level 1 (which is the closest, and gives you a 5-o&#x27;clock sahdow), but the hair collects nicely so you can shake it out into the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been in your situation before, reading these reviews wanting to make the right choice for my first razor. Phillips Norelco works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s a 4.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it takes some practice getting used to it, if you haven&#x27;t used a trimmer before. I think his beard is long, but when he sets it to trim on a 3, it makes it almost look like a five o&#x27;clock shadow. He has only used it twice and he likes it a lot but needs more practice on what the actual settings are like in real life. He says that it doesn&#x27;t pull or tear his facial hair like his cheaper one did so that&#x27;s a plus. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and I think it&#x27;s a great value for the price. There are some pricier ones out there, but he doesn&#x27;t need/want all those bells &amp; whistles.</li>
    <li> I would change a few small things about it, but for the price it does a darn good job. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Quick and simple to use. Lightweight and durable enough to be toss in a bag to bring on vacation. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I wantend one to keep my beard but short And equally long. This one does the job much better than my previous once because of the protective plastic that goes all around. Recommend it</li>
    <li> The adjustable guard bends and flexes as you shave so you get an uneven trim. The guard is mounted on the back of the trimmer not the front where it actually shaves. It has a lot of great reviews so I decided to skip the poor reviews and I shouldn&#x27;t have done that. Now I have uneven hairs all over my face. The only thing I can think the other positive reviewers were using it for is without the guard in place because the guard is absolute garbage and there is absolutely no way someone could get an even trim with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great.  The battery lasts for a long time without a charge.  Simple, well made, good blades.  Reasonable priced.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product in low cost that works well and economical like it, there is scope for improvement battery life but it works great..</li>
    <li> Been using this almost a year, still working as well as the day I got it. It&#x27;s on the smaller size for beard timmers, which I find makes it easier to use if you want to use it on your mustache as well. Solidly built, rounded edge is a big plus as my last trimmer had a point which made things more difficult than they needed to be.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome and affordable. I have used several other brands but this one is excellent bang for the buck! Nice product!</li>
    <li> I love the simple knob to adjust the settings.  Should have junk my old trimmer years ago. Highly recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, I like it and hope it lasts awhile for me, make sure you check the settings&lt;br /&gt;I almost shaved my goat off :)</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time and it was super easy to use and clean.  Great price and trusted brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this since it looked like it was cut-free, but I have nicked myself where my throat meets my neck on several occasions (lowest setting only).  I do have loose skin since I&#x27;m an older fella, but other than the nicks I do really like it a lot - lots of adjustment lengths so I can use it for my eyebrows as well as for the &#x27;recently shaved&#x27; or &#x27;not-so-recently shaved&#x27; looks.</li>
    <li> I really hate this item, I was looking for a product this is better then I was using previously but got disappointed with in few days, don&#x27;t but this s***.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my fiance and he loves it! He only uses it once a week or so, but we&#x27;ve had it for 2 months now and he hasn&#x27;t had to charge it once!</li>
    <li> good for controlling your beard</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I needed.  Like the small increments so you can dial it to exactly what length you want to trim to.  Easy to clean!</li>
    <li> So the difference between this and their high end model is the vacuum and the battery.  This has no vacuum so be ready to make a mess but from what I read the vacuum feature doesn&#x27;t work well on the high end ones anyway.  Also the battery is lower grade and takes longer to charge, but here is the deal do you need it more than once every 10 hours for more than 30 mins? Nope so why spend 4 times the money for something that works exactly the same.  Someone did mention it trims short (as the specs tell you) and it does as i keep my beard pretty short but its still setting number 7 of 10. So just a heads up on that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a [[ASIN:B002C741NG Philips Norelco QC5055]] to trim my beard &amp; mustache for the past 3.5 years.  It&#x27;s been working OK, but the battery failed after the first year and now the plastic comb guides are getting weak and don&#x27;t consistently support the device, which means I get scalped sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to finally put aside the old one and start over with this new [[ASIN:B00ARF42D4 Philips Norelco QT4000/42 Beard Trimmer]].  I like the more compact design and the comb is much more sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this through two trim cycles so far and it&#x27;s done a great job.  The wheel that adjusts the comb (blade height) is designed great.  It clicks right into place, so that it&#x27;s always the same height (a \\&quot;3\\&quot; is always a \\&quot;3\\&quot;, etc.).  I also like the fact that it has so many positions, instead of just a small, medium, or large depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a few minor complaints though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Kind of tricky to clean.  This isn&#x27;t as simple as other trimmers that I&#x27;ve owned.  The comb is a little more difficult to get off, and then the blade snaps on roughly.  Compared to other trimmers, I was really shocked at how filthy this was inside after just one use.  I&#x27;ll definitely need to thoroughly clean it after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Not another charger!  I wish this used a more standard power adapter.  So many devices are switching to mini or micro USB.  It would have been nice if they had used a standard connection so I wouldn&#x27;t need to keep another charger around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those two small gripes, I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> First off i dont grow a beard and will use it to trim my moustache.Charge time is like 10 hours and im not liking that at all.It shouldnt take that long to charge it.After charging they say it will last for 35 minutes.It has ten settings for the length you want your beard.I set it on the shortest setting and trimmed my moustach.It did a good job and was nice and even.Im sure it would do just fine if you have a beard.Comes with a 2 year warranty and the price is reasonable.Not a bad choice if this is an item you need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve grown a beard for over 2 decades and I have two older Norelco trimmers that work great. I was curious about this one to see if it was any better and since it is the first I&#x27;ve owned that is specifically for beards I thought it might be somehow innovative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Not all beards are alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some men&#x27;s beard growth can be sparse in places and the only way to make our faces look like we don&#x27;t have mange is to let the hairs grow a bit longer to cover the sparse areas. (A lot of men have this issue and decline to grow beards because of it.) My chin and stache have thick, solid growth as do my jaws, sideburns and neck. However, my cheeks are a little sparse and I let that hair grow to about 1/2 an inch or so to cover and it looks fine. If I were to use this trimmer as instructed, all hairs would be cut the same length and my cheeks would look mangy. When trimming those areas, I simply take off the comb head and let the trimmer glide above those areas to catch the wild ones and comb the rest down. This trimmer works very well in that regard... sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why sort of?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular trimmer is not shaped as intuitively as one would expect. It seems backward to me. For the way I like to trim my beard it does not work well. The cutting blades are on the opposite side of the handle curve. As well, the on/off button is hard to find at first. I think it would have been pretty easy to put a color on that portion. All the rest of the functionality works great and the blades are very sharp and easy to clean out since the cutting head comes off easily. The adjustable trimming comb feature works well otherwise and is infinitely adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of infinite, the other thing that seems odd is that the measurements of the adjustable trimming comb in the instructions are in bizarrely tiny units. I could understand 1/16th or 1/8th units, but 32nds? What guy really gets down to those miniscule measurements to trim a beard that is going to grow overnight? I think some design engineer went a bit off the deep end on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging cord ONLY fits this trimmer, none of my other Noreclo trimmers, which I find to be rather idiotic. Why not make all the cords from the same manufacturer fit all models of the rechargeable trimmers? Bad design decision, Norelco!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars for the quality and ease of cleaning, two taken away for the design flaws.going to grow overnight?

    <li> Bought it as a gift, and the person who received is so excited to have, says it is the best shave he has ever had!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He had been trimming his goatee with scissors for many years, with me trimming the sides he couldn&#x27;t see well without a second mirror. He absolutely loves this trimmer! The first time he used it, he was astonished and wondered why he&#x27;d never had one before. It takes him maybe 3 minutes to trim his entire goatee and mustache, with the added benefit that I&#x27;m no longer poking him in the side of the face with the scissors. He&#x27;s mentioned several times how much he loves this thing.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these elsewhere expressly because they say it holds a charge for a long time. After about eight months it would slow down so much that it couldn’t finish trimming my beard. I’d have to let it recharge for a while to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four months later, I just threw it out. It got to where it would bog down on the first cut.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my old trimmer which had the separate attachments.  After losing or breaking a few of the attachments over the years I figured it would be best to have a trimmer with the attachments built right in.  Be warned...this can lead to facial hair experimentation as I was able to quickly switch from one length setting to another.  Followed the instructions and charged it fully the first time...been 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve yet to notice a drop in energy level.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> It works better than I thought on my valaptous man beard for trimming. Won&#x27;t give you a clean shave but it wil take it close (5 o&#x27;clock shadow). I am a part of the dollar shave club so I wmjoy it for a night on the town on the go situations</li>
    <li> I keep a short to medium beard and trim every 3 or four days.  I really liked my old trimmer (a different brand), but it&#x27;s battery stopped charging after 10 years of use.  I like this new one even better so far.  I prefer not to have a charging station sitting out.  I like charging it when it&#x27;s low after lots of uses, but the rest of the time it&#x27;s not tying up an outlet or sitting out.  Good adjustability for my needs.</li>
    <li> I wish battery would last a little longer, that it had some kind of indicator or... I don&#x27;t know, the blade isn&#x27;t as strong as I though... but overall, it does a good job, nice for just trimming.</li>
    <li> Works great and it&#x27;s easy to use. Easy to clean also.</li>
    <li> Battery died after about six months of twice per week use. Not worth pursuing a warranty claim on a $20 item, so sadly this goes to the e-waste junk heap.</li>
    <li> I never expected too much anyways. So its alright</li>
    <li> This was a decent product while it was still functional. But the battery WILL stop holding a charge and eventually die, not doubt about it. I had this trimmer for about a year before it stopped holding a charge. It lasted a few more months of having to be plugged in constantly before it stopped working properly. Spend more money and buy something that lasts.</li>
    <li> so cool for the price not heavy at all and the switch botton really help me !</li>
    <li> This is a good beard trimmer for the price.  Instead of using snap-on guides that determine the length of the beard, it uses a single, adjustable guide.  It is a feature that works well.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike it that I need to keep stopping to clear away the cut beard hair that builds up in the cutter blades.  THis is a minor annoyance, but annoying nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer holds a charge for a good while.  The instructions say that you should let the trimmer go completely dead before recharging it, much like the procedure with ni cad batteries.  This one uses a NiMH battery that provides (according to the manufacturer) 35 minutes of used after a 10 hour charge.  That tells me that this is a very slow charger, which is a good thing for long battery life.  The faster the charge, the shorter the battery life.  This battery one should last a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the trim itself, I have no complaints.  There is virtually no plucking or pulling of the bears-just a nice clean cut.  I have had a beard for 45 years, and this works as well or better than any trimmer I have used during that time.</li>
    <li> for the price it is pretty good but not the best trimmer by far gets the job done I suppose but was expecting it to function better</li>
    <li> This is a basic, easy to use simple trimmer. This trimmer has settings of 1mm to 10mm in increments of .5mm. Its great for the short stubble look however if you&#x27;re looking to go shorter than 1mm go with the iStubble from Conair as that goes down to .4mm. If you&#x27;re looking for the super short stubble get the iStubble however if 1mm suffices get this as the price cant be beat for the great device that it is. Simple to clean with the removeable head and the blades have helped up super nice along the way. No dulling from what I can see and the best part...you don&#x27;t have to oil the blades! The product comes with a 2 year warranty from Phillips and will do the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> it holds a charge well and does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but the plastic guard starts to flex as you set it to longer lengths, overall a great buy for the money</li>
    <li> it was cheap that&#x27;s why i bought it. I new customer of yours and i think I&#x27;ll be in the satisfied customers list.</li>
    <li> I love the adjustable beard length. So much easier and consistent. However, it doesnt have a charging stand. You have plug it in like you do your phone, which is kind of a bummer. But for the price, who cares. Also, it says the charge will last 15 days. Even if it lasts a week, I think it is fine.</li>
    <li> For a change you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot to get a lot. This little machine delivers and then some.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my grandson.  It is easy to use, light weight and comfortable to hold.  It keeps his beard looking nice and neat.</li>
    <li> Does the job. Cheap materials. Kind of hard to clean out sometimes if you&#x27;re doing a bigger job with it.</li>
    <li> It is the best trimmer I have used so far. The best thing is it has scales (1-9) to ensure different sizes you could use to trim. Battery life is very good unlike other trimmers.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it. Have to charge after every use, else it goes dead.</li>
    <li> The best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
    <li> Looked at all sorts of beard trimmers. I did not want to spend a lot of money. For around $20 dollars this trimmer can&#x27;t be beat. Blades stay sharp and does not pull hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a while now without any issues.  It&#x27;s so simple to change the length (you just turn the dial).  For me a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; is about a day to almost 2 days growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean too .. you rinse the blades with water (no oil is needed) and you use the tiny brush for the area under the blades.  No regrets.</li>
    <li> Basic trimmer. Order placed 9/18/14. Did it&#x27;s job until today, 11/8/14, when the power supply on the trimmer itself would no longer take power (I only used it when plugged into a wall outlet). Will look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Love it works wonderful for all hair cutting situations. Better then a regular barber clippers. Lynn from Saint Louis Missouri.</li>
    <li> very nice for the $$.    and no one paid me to say this, i bought this on amazon like everything i review.... im 100% verified</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to replace my old beard trimmer.  If you just want to trim your beard/mustache, this is the one to go with.  Tried the others with all the other attachments and features and prefer this one.</li>
    <li> Bought this awhile ago.  Use it twice weekly to trim beard. Works awesome and appears very durable.  I have yet to have to have to charge it and I&#x27;ve had it for at least 3 months.</li>
    <li> I have had a beard for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;I have had a few different trimmers, and this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t nick your face, and hold a charge for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;And it is well priced. Buy it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> I had a more expensive beard trimmer that broke due to the baggage handlers at the airport. This was a great quick and cheap replacement. I was surprised with the quality of it in my hand. It is very smooth and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Does the job but I wish the guard was removable.</li>
    <li> Cheap.. Cheap and cheap.....&lt;br /&gt;Buy another model a little more expensive, can&#x27;t be worse.</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  Very easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> First cordless trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought that does exactly what I need.  Automatic length adjustment is easy to use and allows you to set it to the perfect length you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m nearly full blood Irish, thick hard beard that grows very full. The blades that came with this trimmer were either never sharp to start with or totally dull within 4 uses. The first couple of times I used it I didn&#x27;t reaize that it wasn&#x27;t full charged, I assumed that was why it was trimming badly but even after charging for 72 hours it still pulls more hair out then it cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally useless, will never buy again.</li>
    <li> I trim/shave only once a month and this does everything I need it to. The battery stayed charged surprisingly long for a NiCd, three months with 3 uses at around 5 minute runs a piece.</li>
    <li> no0o0t bad but not perfect</li>
    <li> Never had one before as this is the first time I&#x27;ve grown a beard.  Unit is lightweight, easy to use &amp; quiet.  I have to make several passes over the same area to get an even trim but as I stated, I&#x27;m new to this &amp; with an uneven surface (face) to work on, this might be the best it gets.  Overall, especially for the price, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for trimming. It shaves every part evenly including the size wanted. I really recommend it for those who are trying to have stylish beard.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works well and I find it has a good variety of settings for trim length.  The battery has held a charge for a long time.  I didn&#x27;t have to charge it for 3 or 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Only 6 months ago this was selling for $17.99 and now the price is jumping around all over the place, sometimes doubling or even tripling. Come on Philips, stop with the ridiculous price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for several weeks and have not had to charge it once.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is that there is a sharp corner on the back of the guard that always catches my lip.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll file that corner down with one of my wife&#x27;s emery boards and I think it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I should have known better than to purchase this cheap, Chinese-made shaver. The first day I received it in the mail, I had already managed to pull the cabling out of the AC power adapter by accident. No problem though, I just stuck the cables back in and it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after having used this beard trimmer 3 times, the motor would start and seconds after stop. I took the blade/clip part off to figure out what the problem was with the blades off the shave would run, so the motor was fine. However, after placing the blades back on the motor, it would stop. I figure it&#x27;s probably causing too much friction between the blades for the motor to spin, so it stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is, I&#x27;m sure I could have figured out what the problem was with this thing, but after only 3 shaves, I didn&#x27;t find it worth it. I suggest if you want to shave/trim properly, you get something of good quality and possibly German made. This piece of junk probably won&#x27;t last you long, and even if it does, it&#x27;s only useful for</li>
    <li> Bought this for my huband. He was very satisfied. Good product.</li>
    <li> This is a handy sized beard trimmer. It is about the size and weight of an electric toothbrush. It isn&#x27;t very noisy. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of attachments. It just has the one cover. It comes off by pulling straight up. The metal piece pulls forward and up and is harder to replace. It has a blue dial that can be changed from 1 to 10 to vary the length of the cut. The attachment can be put under water, but not the rest of the trimmer. My husband says it does a nice job of trimming his beard.</li>
    <li> I grew out my first beard this past November for no-shave (friend of mine got diagnosed with prostate cancer).  At the end of the month my wife decided that she liked the beard but it desperately needed trimming.  The adjustable guard is great and allowed me to shape my beard nicely.  You&#x27;ll still likely need a buzzer or something depending on how you like to do your edging, but for the beard itself this is great.  I used 3 different lengths overall to get everything blended and looking nice, which was easily done with the dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons are the fact that you can&#x27;t run it off of an outlet when plugged in and that there is no &amp;#34;fully charged&amp;#34; indication.  Since the battery lasts so long you sometimes forget about charging it, so if you&#x27;re not careful you could end up with half of a face trimmed and the other half...not so much.  If that happens, you&#x27;ll have to wait until the battery gets some charge back in to it.</li>
    <li> i dont really shave anymore, i only trim my face. This trimmer is very good for a sensitive face like mine. its soft and trims very short! and it also has alot of good settings and pieces that i dont really use but could be beneficial to others looking to purchase this item! so i hope this helps! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Did not find any real issues with this but it gets discharged easily. Wish it can hold a little more charge.</li>
    <li> Easy to operate, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have a charge indicator LED, so no way to know when the battery is going to run out or when it is fully charged.</li>
    <li> Does not run off of wall charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Runs out halfway through shaving leaving you to wait till it recharges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming works very well however.</li>
    <li> I guess I have to say this is just OK.  My previous trimmer, also a Norelco, was much better.  The comb tends to push the hairs aside rather than guide them to the clipper.  It does get the job done, but I hae to stop and comb out my beard frequently during use.</li>
    <li> When you read the instructions that come with this unit, you&#x27;ll learn that the rechargeable battery is not replaceable.  When, eventually (and who knows how soon that will be?) the battery will no longer hold a charge, you&#x27;re instructed to cut some wires, extract the battery for approved disposal, and toss the clipper in the trash.  That&#x27;s it.  The whole thing is kaput once the original battery loses recharge-ability.  Are you shocked?  I was.  Also, there is no low- battery indicator, so in theory you could be halfway through a beard trim when the unit stops without warning.  Then it would be 10 hours of charging before you could finish the trim job.  In the meantime, let&#x27;s hope you don&#x27;t care about looking your best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I known these things sooner, I might have chosen a different clipper--one with replaceable batteries or one that would let me use it on an AC cord when the battery is down.  However,  I kept the unit and have been using it for about 6 weeks with quite satisfactory results.  It&#x27;s still going on its initial charge, and shows no sign of slowing down.  (I have only a mustache and goatee, and I don&#x27;t trim them every day.)  At first it&#x27;s a little tricky to reinstall the cutter blades after taking them out for cleaning, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly.  Given the very reasonable price of the unit, I don&#x27;t really regret buying it.  Still, you might want to consider the points I make above.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer, but the charge time/battery duration relation (10Hs/30min), it&#x27;s not a good effort. Still like it.!</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I&#x27;m new to the facial hair thing and this is easy to use, consistent, and easy to clean.  I feel it will last a while, but will definitely get another when this one stops working.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even clip one nut with this!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, compact, easy to clean, nice design</li>
    <li> Love it!! Perfect for what I need. Seems to hold a charge longer than I expected.</li>
    <li> Good one... It cost more..</li>
    <li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but so far I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the trimmer&#x27;s performance. The housing does have a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; appearance, but it&#x27;s growing on me.</li>
    <li> It works great and does what its intended to do!</li>
    <li> If you not going to have a beard forever then this is worth it. I have never tried it and if I had to do over I would buy one that can vacuum as you trim. This has been a good trimmer and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband as a Christmas present. He uses it all of the time and it&#x27;s worked very well. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Broke after only a few months. Not Happy with it. I would suggest spending a few extra dollars on a high quality razor.</li>
    <li> It is too small, very fragile and hard to clean. I am disappointed by Philips and recommend something more sturdy.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Long battery life, easy to use and clean:)  I recommend this product to everyone that needs a quick trim.</li>
    <li> Does a great job for any length facial hair.  Easy to use, instructions are good and the results are what one would expect.</li>
    <li> Compact, efficient, holds a charge forever, this is exactly what I had in mind. Easy to clean, comb guide slides out for direct trimming, and the dial settings lock precisely into place.</li>
    <li> Could be better with a charging base and automatic off for the charger.  It works well as a hair trimmer for high and tight at the deepest setting</li>
    <li> My husband needed a simple beard trimmer, and with so many reviews, this clearly seemed the winner.&lt;br /&gt; You pay for what you get- plastic feels cheap, the trimmer piece and plastic head attachment constantly fall or pop off. Can&#x27;t be used in the shower, though I had read it can be used in the water/shower.</li>
    <li> The Norelco trimmer I replaced due to it being too old was better than this one.  It was a bit wider and seemed to comb hair into the trimmer itself better (does that make sense?)  The battery does last a long time and it is very light.</li>
    <li> Works great when you are trying to keep a stubble type beard. Easy to use and to clean. Perfect product.</li>
    <li> ok. so he doesn&#x27;t use this as often as i&#x27;d hoped. they were definitely a &amp;#34;hint&amp;#34; gift. but he loves it and does use it from time to time</li>
    <li> Very good for trimming purposes. Nothing extra special, but great for the cost.</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> This trimmer really sucks....dont buy it...complete waste of money....doesnt trim evenly at all even after multiple go arounds.....very disappointed with this product</li>
    <li> By the time I used it twice, its battery started to die down. I recharged it (for about 8-10 hours) and five minutes into the use, the battery died donw again. The same story happens every time I try to use. No product has ever failed me as this one. Definitely not recommended!!!</li>
    <li> Had this for a month. Excellent product. Appealing streamlined look, nice feel in hand, precisely adjustable beard hair length (especially in the short range), quiet, fast and even cut, easy to clean. The best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used. I wish it had a trim catch compartment, but that&#x27;s a minor consideration. Easily beats out the Braun Old Spice model (see that review).</li>
    <li> Great. Works out of box. Hard to know when it is done charging</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer....settings are easy.  I would have preferred a stand for it vs adapter and loose cord.</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmer I ever owned. I would be lost without it.</li>
    <li> It works good for the basic beard trimming. The permenatnt guard makes it easy to travel with and not have to cary seperate guards.</li>
    <li> Have used many trimmers - most guards have plastic that breaks after some time.  This one is designed so that it won&#x27;t break.  Does the job well.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this. Gives me that two day stubble look I wanted very easily. Also good on sideburns and really any hair you want to trim. I used a little too much pressure the first time and nicked myself. Since then I use a softer touch and it&#x27;s smooth sailing. Easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> This thing works great for me.  I had had it for a few months now and no complaints.  Be aware that this isn&#x27;t really a beard trimmer and more of a scruff trimmer.  The longest length you can put it on isn&#x27;t very long.  I haven&#x27;t really had any other beard trimmers so I don&#x27;t know if this is common.  I guess you would have to get a hair trimmer to trim anything longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall this works great for me.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 5/5 because it does everything I want it to do. I just wanted it to trim hair quick. I gave it some hair clipper oil to preserve the blade. No problems.</li>
    <li> Was using a basic buzzer before this.  I would never go back.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Works fine cleans up easy.</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer for the price.  I dropped mine on the floor and the guard popped right out of the trimmer.  Pops right back in also.  Now, when I want to trim without the guard, I just pull it right out and it works perfectly.  I think that will address any of the other complaints I saw about the guard not being removable.</li>
    <li> Best Bang for your buck!!! The adjustable comb makes it easy to get the length you want right. Lastly, the battery life will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Works as described good beard trimmer for the money</li>
    <li> This works like a charm.  Adjustments are easy and the charge lasts a long time.  I can do my heavy beard and my whole head at least three times on a charge... and that&#x27;s a very big job.  Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what other trimmer you&#x27;d pay this little and get as much quality.</li>
    <li> Cuts well, feels sturdy. The fact that the guard snaps on and has multiple lengths is a plus, I&#x27;m always misplacing my clipper guards. Overall a great value and product.</li>
    <li> They could double market this thing as a stubble shooting device. Somehow beard fuzz ends up shooting across my bathroom every time I go in for a trim. It works fairly well. It&#x27;s my first trimmer, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if others work better. It&#x27;s certainly more functional at trimming other, flatter areas, though.</li>
    <li> works good, but without the guard it can pinch and break the skin. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied and  would recommended it for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this bad boy! Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Blade adjustment easy to use- no bulky attachments, lightweight</li>
    <li> Great little trimmer for the price.  Keeps my beard trimmed neatly and holds a charge very well.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome trimmers well worth the money</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. You can set it for any length.</li>
    <li> HOW IS THIS A TOP-RATED PRODUCT?! This is a cheap piece of junk. Internal battery died literally after 2 uses and Amazon will not honor my return. I have had a 99% positive experience with Amazon, but this is unacceptable.     Update: Amazon has decided to make an exception even though I am outside my return window. Amazon customer service is always extremely cooperative and understanding, and this is why I prefer to buy from Amazon. I can tolerate a defective/bad purchase every now and then knowing Amazon will usually do the right thing.</li>
    <li> If you want CHEAP QUALITY, then this is the beard trimmer to purchase.  Overpriced for what you are buying.  Philips Norelco has sold me the last such device.  That CHEAP, CHEAP QUALITY plastic slip-on head will break ever so easily and then all you can do is throw it away and go buy a new one.  At least their original one from a couple years ago, gave you SEVERAL heads that one could make work, but not easily breakable like this piece of garbage!</li>
    <li> simple works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not for the close shaves, but general maintenance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;batt life good like most razors</li>
    <li> works really well and the battery charge seems to last forever, at least now, when it is new</li>
    <li> The motor is quite powerful. It is easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a month and love it.  Gives a great &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.  Charge seems to last a very long time.  I&#x27;ve used it every other day for a month without a recharge.  Best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer. It&#x27;s low-cost and reliable. Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t charge while you&#x27;re using it, so if the battery runs out, you need to wait for a 20-30min charge before being able to properly use it, in oppose to just using it plugged in. Other than that, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Boyfriend loves it. Ever since he got it, he&#x27;s more daring about shaping his beard. He can trim it, shape it, shave it and maintain it with this little guy. Very good product, happy purchase!</li>
    <li> It seems to be filling up with hair and had to be cleaned few times during one shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a decent trimmer for the money with a good battery life however I bought it to keep a beard trimmed very short. I feel that the shortest setting leaves my beard uneven or &amp;#34;patchy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! this thing gets such a close shave, but still leaving a little stuble. You can also remove the guard, and get a nice trim on neck hair, or sideburns. I would buy this thing over and over again.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older trimmer with this when the adjustment finally gave up.  I wish I had done it so much sooner.  This trims my beard in 1/4 the time; its super fast and clean.  The adjustments are intuitive and it holds a charge for weeks.  Great product</li>
    <li> Works great for mustache.</li>
    <li> Excellent beard trimmer for the price.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and is just as described by the most popular reviewers. I have no complaints about this trimmer at all. I was surprised by how well it works and doesn&#x27;t pull any hairs. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone who wants a short to medium length seasonal beard.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Works pretty well on battery power. Definitely need a few passes with it to get hairs even, but that&#x27;s to be expected. Love the integrated length adjustment; very smart design.  Edit: it&#x27;s about two years old, and already the battery can barely hold a charge. Can&#x27;t even get through an entire beard trimming before the battery dies, and it doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in. Major design flaw. Love the look and feel of it with the integrated length guide, but the battery is awful.</li>
    <li> Works great as a budget beard trimmer.  Haven&#x27;t had any complaints so far and my beard looks just the way I want it to.  Clean up is easy and quick.</li>
    <li> Keeps me well trimmed.</li>
    <li> I just love it.....very effective to be used in your entired body.</li>
    <li> This Philips Norelco beard trimmer will, I think, ultimately become my backup beard trimmer.  I recently purchased a new trimmer after the two I had been using for several years bit the dust: one quit taking a charge and the second one&#x27;s blades became too dull to be used comfortably (and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new trimmer than to have the old blades sharpened).  I like to keep two trimmers functioning in case one suddenly dies or is lost while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is about what you would expect from a trimmer of its price-range.  It is a little lighter than I am comfortable with (a heavier trimmer generally gives me a cleaner trim, I find) but it has a good overall \\&quot;feel\\&quot; as regards the quality of its build.  Where it fails to impress me is in the \\&quot;sharpness\\&quot; of its cut; it sometimes seems to snag a little more than my other shavers have done in the past, including my other recently purchased one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit slower to fully-charge than some trimmers  - and needs re-charging more often than some (based on my experience with other trimmers) - which is a little disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad trimmer, especially as a back-up or dedicated travel trimmer.  Pretty much an average trimmer at an average price.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I had a fair amount of hair on my face before sampling the product, and then try it again after I had a close shave at my local barber&#x27;s to see how it managed stubble.  In order to give it a fair review, I also wanted to do at least three passes of long-hair and stubble.  I also wanted to see how long it could hold a charge at least once (this latter test was a bit of a failure, as my shaves always lasted less than ten (10) minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found the product to have good balance, and it was not too heavy in my palm.  I experienced no problems with jamming or cleaning the device (a small, black brush with brushes on both ends- one one long and the other short- was included with the shaver).  The product included a cord for re-charging, but would have been nicer if it had come with a charging stand/station, thus allowing for the shaver to be stored upright on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were the same after each of my paired trials.  The shaver was good at trimming long hair, but not very good at providing a close shave or dealing with stubble (for this you will a good old fashioned Gillette razor).  The product aids tremendously with trimming, grooming and ultimately making a gent look presentable, but unfortunately works about as well as electric hair clippers when it comes to dealing with stubble- after several passes, all one achieves is a fine layer of peach fuzz on one&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, this product is geared towards trimming, and it does that just fine.  I did a little digging and found a few more products offered by the same company that come in different shapes, colors and ergonomic designs.  One good thing going for the product is its ambidexterity- I had no problems shaving with either my left or right hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last bit of disclosure is needed here: your humble reviewer generally walks about town beardless.  That said, I had to grow a bit of a beard before trying the product.  Theproduct not only trims but also shaves (a cautionary note, don&#x27;t try it as a head-trimmer- I did, with disastrous results!); however, those like myself that desire the close shave (leaving one&#x27;s face smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom) will most definitely be out of luck with this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver, it works very well.  It is very light.  I like the dial at your fingertips for adjusting the clipper length.  Just have to be careful you don&#x27;t hit it and change length while you are shaving.  The clip comes off easily so you can shave without it as well.  very nice shaver/trimmer.</li>
    <li> Very good value for the quality and features</li>
    <li> Have had it over a year now.  Does a good job and has great battery life.</li>
    <li> works perfectly well, much better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;At first I started reading all the reviews on different trimmers and despite some bad reviews on this one I decided to go for it, and worked much better than others I had (for both beard and hear).</li>
    <li> Works and easy to travel with.  My only complaint is the adjustments between 2 and 3 is not finite enough. Too much difference between levels. Just wish the adjustment levels were finer.  For my beard and growth- The #1 level is like stubble. #2 level is like 3 day growth. #3 is like 10 day growth...</li>
    <li> Perfect for the beard/mustache owner who just want a quick fix. No clip on, nothing! Throw it in the dob kit and off you go!</li>
    <li> So far, so good! The battery life is a little short, but other than that, it trims what it&#x27;s supposed to trim. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 1/11/2017: So I&#x27;ve had this thing for 4 years now. The battery started pooping out on me at least over a year ago if not longer, but I kept using it and tolerating the pinch of the now-slow-moving blades due to laziness and not wanting to pay to upgrade. Nowadays though it barely holds a charge and is totally unusable. While I know this is probably common for a product so cheap, and I commend it for working so long regardless, if you&#x27;re in the market for a quality trimmer, I&#x27;d get a newer model.  I was looking for something to complement my electric razor (note: not trimmer) for when I didn&#x27;t feel like a baby-bottom-bald shave, but instead just wanted a nice 5 o&#x27; clock shadow or light stubble. I prefer using this because 1. shearing 3 bags&#x27; full of the entire beard feels emasculating and is reserved only for job interviews and free Thanksgiving dinner at the local Mormon church, and 2. it&#x27;s way more forgiving as far as ripping out those delicate beard hairs than the medieval torture device that is my main electric razor. Seriously, this thing&#x27;s plastic guard feels like Aladdin&#x27;s magic carpet as it glides over your face (or other more private areas, whereby it dutifully performs as well) and yet is nearly as effective as the corded trimmer at the barber shop, but in a $20 rechargeable package.  I can&#x27;t speak to the other trimmers in this category having not tried them, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because this fulfills my needs perfectly and has been for the past year I&#x27;ve been using it. If you&#x27;re considering this one, look no further - the price is right for its stellar functionality.</li>
    <li> Never did find a replacement for my favorite, but this comes close.  Nothing sharp to snap your beard, and the adjustable guide won&#x27;t get lost.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp, easy trims&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable settings work well&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts forever between charges&lt;br /&gt;Easy to take a part&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat hard to clean as you aren&#x27;t supposed to run the main unit under water so have to spend some time brushing it out.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice 5 oclock shadow look if you want that.</li>
    <li> It gets clogged with hair during use.  But it&#x27;s pretty easy to clean with running water.</li>
    <li> Perfect hack job;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is perfect for what I need it for, going over the long whiskers in preparation for a straight razor. However, I do not believe it would be good for actual beard grooming. It&#x27;s good enough for me, but if you&#x27;re a serious beard grower I would recomend paying the extra few dollars and opting for a nicer razor.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product! Perfect trimmer length adjustment 1mm-10mm.</li>
    <li> My second trimmer, feels good to use. Hassle-free cutting and adjusting. Also can be cleaned easily. The ten point length adjustment gives full control and easy trimming of long hairs. 10 hours charging time makes it a bit difficult to charge completely. You actually have to plan a day before trimming as you need much time to fully charge it. Other than that great value for money. Works for straight 45 mins after a full charge. I guess that&#x27;s enough for a good trim.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer, like how the adjustable height is easy to fix in place compared to comparable models. Sometimes can get a little clogged but easy to clear.</li>
    <li> Okay. Worked awesome first time, but after the 7 setting its not very effective, but to stay short and tight it works good</li>
    <li> Good quality very happy</li>
    <li> I use it today, and It broke skin, and I discovered I had 2-3 cuts. I totally was not expecting this, and this should not happen with a brand like this. Unsafe.</li>
    <li> Does what I wanted it to, and for a really good price.</li>
    <li> Real  good for the price. Compact, easy to use and clean. Helps me stay away from the barber a little longer before I need a more precise touch-up. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I started growing a Goatee just as this became available, so it&#x27;s my very first Beard Trimmer. That said, I&#x27;m very satisfied by its performance, and particularly by its ability to hold a charge, as my Norelco shaver unfortunately doesn&#x27;t hold one very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I had to get a feel for how to set the \\&quot;shield\\&quot; that controlled the depth of the beard, and I found that I had to set it quite close to the trimmer to make an impact on my goatee, so the longer settings are probably more than adequate for anyone other than someone going for the Tom Hanks Castaway look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction seems pretty solid for something so affordable. It&#x27;s clearly plastic and fairly light, but I dropped it onto the tile floor by accident and it kept working with no problem.  All in all, quite pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> love it.shaves very close</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to, easy to clean. Well built.</li>
    <li> I have to say after using it a few times it seems to do the job well. I cant say its the sturdiest thing in the world, but definitely enough to get tho job done. held a charge for a couple of shaves which is more then i could ask for. I have only tried the lower settings, about 1-4, but it always stays on the correct cutting length when shaving.</li>
    <li> I did tons of research before I picked this trimmer.  I wanted something that I could plug in and use....no cleaning, oiling, or sharpening required.  My son was beginning to look a bit like Grizzly Adams.  You younger kids may not know who that is, but I didn&#x27;t want my son looking that way.  We&#x27;ve had this razor for quite awhile now, and it works fantastic.  The only thing I have to do is tap it out and blow it when I&#x27;m done.  I have it set at 2, and it gives my son a nice looking beard without making him look like a castaway.</li>
    <li> Does everything that i want it to and has a great batttery life</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now. It works great to this day. I have no complaints. I recommended it to a friend and he loves it just as much as me.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a new beard shaver for a considerable amount of time. There are several things that I really like about this product. 1.) It has ten different levels to adjust to in trimming a beard. Many shavers only have a few to choose from. 2.) It comes with a charger and has a battery within. You do not have to change the batteries out all the time like I did in my old shaver. There is one suggestion I would make to the makers of this trimmer. The guard is not only adjustable, but removable for trimming near the nose or above the lip.</li>
    <li> Product does not work. I cannot recharge it....</li>
    <li> I guess I got what I was hoping for and what you would expect from Philips for the Price.  It is a decent product that did a good job of trimming my beard but with few whistles and bells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to get a trimmer for my travel bag and it fills that role perfectly, well except that it would have been nice if it came in a small travel bag or container. The construction is pretty good. It worked well right out of the box (corded) for the initial trim and then a few days later it worked well again on battery power.  I did like the rotary setting for the guard height, and found that the guide goes higher than my other trimmer which is a nice plus.  I am very happy to have it for my travel trimmer but it feels like it could stand up to fairly regular usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I&#x27;m giving it an underwhelming review, it&#x27;s not anything to pull out and show the friends, but it does the job.  For the price point, a very decent trimmer.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. Charging system could be a bit better, and if you&#x27;re not careful, you can accidentally dial in a lower height while actually using the trimmer. You can avoid this by holding it nearer to the base, but it&#x27;s a slightly annoying design flaw.</li>
    <li> This beard trimmer does an excellent job of taking me from wandering, hippy, possible mental patient, to out of place nerd with a neatly trimmed beard in about 10 minutes.  Thanks, Norelco!</li>
    <li> This thing is LOUD!! No chance at a discreet trim at all. Otherwise, it seems sharper than my old trimmer, but probably for a reason. The knob is kind of hard to turn, but the comb is durable and works well. Haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet, but haven&#x27;t used it much.  Update June 2015- got a chance to use it more, do not like it. Not good for body trimming, the angle is weird and it&#x27;s not easy to grip. Would not buy again and was a waste of money. If all you&#x27;re using it for is facial hair, it&#x27;s fine. But anything else, and blood starts to be a thing.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works beautifully!!</li>
    <li> Its decent, but a little hard to be precise with trimming due to the plastic cover. Work nice without it on, but keep it away from sensitive areas..Face, chest, legs are ok..</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. My beard looks is looking much better since I got this</li>
    <li> Wont charge while using it. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> this design is awful.  the idea behind it, i suppose, is that it&#x27;s too hard to put different length guards on a razor, changing them out depending on your preference for length. instead, they have this knob you turn to push a guard that is attached to the razor closer or farther away from the metal shavers. however, this fixed guard, which resembles a plastic cage, obstructs the razors too much for them to do anything other than give you a patchy shave.  the first 3 times i used it, i had to trim for 10-15 minutes to get an even shave because the guard blocks you from shaving ... then i just ripped the guard off, and now i use it to sadly shave my beautiful beard into nothing but a long stubble. i should have gotten a more expensive electric razor, and hope you do.</li>
    <li> One of the main advantages of this beard trimmer is that it has 10 different lengths of beard that is possible.  I find that versatile and a real benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works well though the instruction sheet for the trimmer is many pages long, surprising for a relatively simple product such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1-17: This beard trimmer just won&#x27;t hold much of a charge.  It poops out half-way through the job.  It will stall and just stop cutting.  I will keep it on the charger, yet it just doesn&#x27;t have much capacity to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am lowering my rating to two stars because of this.  I now have to buy a different trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works well, but just spring for something that doesn&#x27;t make a mess!  Driving me nuts!</li>
    <li> I saw a clip on the news that talked about how women pay more for the same or like products for men. The womens trimmer with a comparable rating on Amazon was $80! I bought this for a bush trimmer.  I like the dial for length because the head doesn&#x27;t slip and it has a nice contour. It does not bite or pull. Does a great job for it&#x27;s purpose and  I am pleased :)</li>
    <li> Worked great for a month until the battery completely died and wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore beyond a few seconds of usage. Charged it for 24 hours, then tried to use it and got only about 15 seconds out of it as it slowly faded out. Tried charging it again, same thing. Piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Only dislike is that it doesn&#x27;t catch the hairs in a little container.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t charge after a few months. I do like Norelco, and it would be a 5 star product if the charging worked for longer.</li>
    <li> The trimmer seems to work well, although close trimming seems impossible. It will trim my beard well, but I have to use a different trimmer on the edges.</li>
    <li> Great Beard Trimmer. Just wish it had the catcher for the trimmings. Other than that it is perfect.</li>
    <li> Now I look super fly for the ladies! Sick!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a first for me.  It does everything I want and is easy to use.  I especially like the easy way it adjusts to different cutting lengths, without a bunch of accessories.</li>
    <li> It does well for the price tag but the trim is not quite perfect...everything considered it&#x27;s still a very good trimmer with an almost great price tag...would recommend</li>
    <li> very good item, perfect trims good baterry life does the work as expected , so overall a very good purchase</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing bad I can say. It&#x27;s powerful and effective. Battery life is great and the array of settings is great.</li>
    <li> Arrived on schedule and in perfect condition.  The razor exceeded expectations. This model is much easier to dial in a precise cut without guess work.  I have owned several beard trimmers in the past from various mfg (major brands). It is critical you follow directions on battery charging and not leave them plugged in charging for days. That will kill battery life.  I recommend fully.  Light weight, Easy to use and powerful. As usually Amazon does a great job in on time delivery and proper shipping packaging to prevent transportation damage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright trimmer - it gets the job done but it doesn&#x27;t cut very clean or evenly.  It takes a while to figure out how to properly set it so you don&#x27;t screw up your beard.  The other issue I&#x27;ve had with it is it spits hair all over the place.  Conveniently enough, Phillips has another model that supposedly catches the hair - you just need to pay more.  Overall this is probably my 4th-5th trimmer and I think I&#x27;m just going to invest in a more professional one instead of these cordless ones.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. It&#x27;s a cheap price, and feels cheaply made and is overall not that powerful. It does trim but sometimes not very evenly and can feel rough on the skin.</li>
    <li> Not the best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned, but by far the best value. Get&#x27;s the job done, and if (when) it breaks, I&#x27;ll buy another one knowing that it&#x27;s the best dollar for dollar shaver/trimmer I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
    <li> This is top notch, very good cutter. And holds a charge thur a couple of close haircuts</li>
    <li> It works but takes awhile to charge and once it&#x27;s dead you can&#x27;t use it until charged.</li>
    <li> Died after one year of use.  Not as maneuverable or as close a shave as an older beard trimmer we had, which also lasted a decade.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s convenient and does the job. Sometimes you gotta go over the same spot many times to get the right length and the zero guard will do nothing for small hairs. You&#x27;ll still need a razor for that.</li>
    <li> Great trimmer! Very comfortable grip and good reach. Various settings will help you with almost any style that you have. Charge holds quite well too. If it needs charging you will notice right away. It seems that it works very well almost until the end instead of gradually performing worse while loosing charge. For me it just dies on the last trim or performs really really poor - time to charge. Frankly I prefer it this way, but see for yourself</li>
    <li> Gets the job done .. Great trimmer! My bf loved it. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This was about the 3rd trimmer I have tried and this was by far the best. I always managed to break the teeth on the combs of the other units but the design on this trimmer is much sturdier. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I believe this product works as designed and described. In my opinion, it is an example of getting what you pay for. It does have multiple settings for length. It does trim your facial hair. It&#x27;s smaller than I like and it feels too small in my hand. It&#x27;s about 7&amp;#34; tall. The part where I hold it is right below the blue adjustment dial and at that point, the circumference is 3.5&amp;#34; or about 1.25&amp;#34; across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great to travel with. It fits in my dopp kit planned structure much better than a larger trimmer would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do like that the piece of the charger that plugs into the wall has the light to let you know if it is charging or not. My habit is to charge with the razors are in my dopp kit, so you have to look at them to see the charging light, but for this trimmer, the light is on the charger right at the plug. It&#x27;s a minor, detail, but certainly worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this, especially if you are just starting to keep a beard of at the age where hair grows on your face. You&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s pretty cool. I have a lot of very course hair on my face and have for couple of decades, so maybe I&#x27;m being to harsh with giving it only three starts, but three stars means it&#x27;s okay. For my sixteen year old son who doesn&#x27;t have that much hair, I would absolutely get this for him.</li>
    <li> it works great and is really easy to clean. Very reasonable in price and performs like more expensive models. A+</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer. Works well. Nice basic trimmer.</li>
    <li> My first trimmer.  Works very well, battery lasts weeks with normal trimming every other day.  Fast charge time and great adjustment for any trim length you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works as expected and is quite convenient to use. This is my first trimmer so can&#x27;t really compare it to others, but I am happy with what I got so far.</li>
    <li> Nice low cost shaver, does not give the really close stubble look. It gives something very close but not as fine as the really expensive brands but still is nice especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Cuts through my beard like butter, and it&#x27;s great for precision work too.</li>
    <li> the battery used for this is not worth the low price of the trimmer, i&#x27;ve had one for a few months and leaving it unused after charging will cause the battery to drain completely, it also takes around 8 hours to charge.... invest in a lithium ion battery instead, you&#x27;ll be able to get through an entire trim that way</li>
    <li> My second purchase of this item, I dropped the other one and it stopped working. They both worked well but I am more careful with the new one.</li>
    <li> Very good for giving yourself a permanent 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a clean 5 o&#x27;clock look, use a razor to shave your neck and any stray hairs on your cheeks, and use this on a low guard level on any beard growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was complimented on the shadow look 2 days after using this for the first time. Highly suggested!</li>
    <li> its great if you wear a same size beard,</li>
    <li> Great so far! Doesn&#x27;t pull and good length control!</li>
    <li> Holds a charge.  I charged it when I first got it according to the instructions and I used it for 5 months before I needed to recharge it. Works great to trim my beard</li>
    <li> Does the job, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> small and weak, i returned and for a few more dollars&lt;br /&gt;i chose the Remington MB-200 and love it.</li>
    <li> Son said it did a great job. Was a gift 2 him</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmer out there I know of.</li>
    <li> Perfect for minor trimming. the adjustable blade guard is awesome</li>
    <li> I have been using Philips Norelco for many years now.  The only reason I keep buying a new unit every year is because the adjustable length setting attachment usually breaks.  So i was excited to see this unit because the build in length adjuster seemed sturdy. I used to use setting No. 7 on my old trimmer.  So seeing that this trimmer goes up to 10 made me feel good.  When i tried to use the trimmer I found out that the No 10 setting is actually shorter than their old No. 7 setting.  Digging more deeper I found out that the new unit is actually true 10 i.e. 10 mm.  The old units 7 was actually 13-14 mm or 1/2\\&quot;.  In one of my other trimmer the 1/2\\&quot; setting is called No. 4 setting, go figure.    Although l like this true sizing, this unit is not for me because I like to keep a bit longer beard at 13 mm (1/2\\&quot;) setting.  Besides that for 2 min that i used this trimmer for it seemed fine.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes how easy this is to use and what a great job it does trimming his mustache and beard. He&#x27;s able to keep it trimmed as close as he wants it to be.</li>
    <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
    <li> Works okay, but isn&#x27;t the easiest trimmer to use and is kind of awkward to manipulate.</li>
    <li> 2nd worst product Ive ever bought on amazon. This thing has to stay on the cord and charge fully and than you can do about 1/2 your face and neck before it dies, even while plugged in. do not buy</li>
    <li> It works, very light however does an extremely poor job feeding hair into blade making it hard to trim evenly or quick. You have to go from many different angles to try and force hair in. Will be switching out for another item.</li>
    <li> The Norelco QT4000/42 Beard Trimmer does some things very well but the design of a permanently attached comb with no option to attach longer combs for beards longer than 1/4 inch, means that unless you like a very short beard this trimmer isn&#x27;t as useful I&#x27;d hoped it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was able to use to create a nice edge on my beard, I couldn&#x27;t use it to trim my beard which I like to be longer than a 1/4\\&quot;. If you are looking for a good beard trimmer and like a very short, no longer than 13/64\\&quot; of an inch, beard this is a good little trimmer.</li>
    <li> Works great, still running</li>
    <li> A year ago I bought my guy a new hair clipper, he was very happy with the item and it worked well (he normally trims his own hair). I made the mistake of getting rid of his beard trimmer that he used (much more often) for his goatee and sideburns, I&#x27;m a girl I just assumed that these items did the same thing. After a while of hearing little digs about how \\&quot;this would be much easier with a beard trimmer.\\&quot; So I did my research and after looking at a few models I decided on this one. He was so happy, this model is easy and fast. It has 10 lengths that are all controlled by a dial in the middle that moves the clip up and down with simple \\&quot;clicks\\&quot; left or right. The clip comes off very easy, it simply pulls right out and the metal face comes off simply by pulling it out in the same manner. That makes it very easy to clean. The only thing you have to watch out for is the unit is not waterproof, you can wash the parts that you pull out but cannot run water over the unit. Nevertheless, this is a great and fast unit and it got me out of the dog house. :)</li>
    <li> nice cheap beard trimmer. I use it on a weekly basis to clean up my beard as well as touch up the lines above my lip and under my neck. nice cheap piece and works as expected. No issues with item and battery lasts several weeks for me without having to recharge.</li>
    <li> An excellent trimmer, but it takes some adjusting and testing to find a comfortable length setting on the guard.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with it. Really nice...</li>
    <li> Trimmer broke within two months of owning it.  No idea what happened, it just all of a sudden stopped working.  Charging it doesn&#x27;t do anything and I tried cleaning it and a few other things but still no luck.  Very disappointing.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with this trimmer!</li>
    <li> Some electric trimmers are more versatile than this one, and can easily be used to trim head hair (or even pet hair). The settings on this one really are not as adjustable to broaden the purposes of this trimmer. The way the razors move and and plastic guard are specifically designed for faces and beard hair. So it works pretty well if you have no other plans for it outside of its intended use.</li>
    <li> battery lasts forever and shaving is super quick. cleanup is a bit messy but it&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
    <li> This is a solid trimmer. Great for facial hair. I would not use for shaving head or slight haircuts though. Good little gadget.</li>
    <li> Norelco are the best beard trimmers I have found (last years, good length settings and cut) and this is a great value for one.</li>
    <li> It does an acceptable but not especially impressive job of trimming. What makes the product terrible is how the battery and charging works. The instructions say to only charge the battery once it has completely run out. However, it cannot be charged while it&#x27;s being used, and there&#x27;s no indicator showing how much battery is left. This means that your options are to either occasionally let the battery run out while you use it (leaving you with a half trimmed beard) or disregard the instructions and shorten the life span of the battery by charging it after each use. I see no reason why they would have made this trimmer unable to run off of the power from the charging cable when the battery is dead. That is a common feature and not an expensive one to implement. And without it, this trimmer is completely unreliable.</li>
    <li> Had this for about a month. Works great, no cuts or uneven shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to use and keep clean. Great product</li>
</ol>
