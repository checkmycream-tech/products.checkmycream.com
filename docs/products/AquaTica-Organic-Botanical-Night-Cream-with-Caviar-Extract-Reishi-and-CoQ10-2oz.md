<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used and I love that it is organic.  I use it over a retinol product (after waiting 30 min.)  in the PM  to keep the retinol from burning my face.  The reason I&#x27;m rating a 4 star is due to the smell.  The last bottle I received smelled like the inside of an old medicine cabinet.  Such a lovely product should have no fragrance or a better one.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of very expensive face products before but nothing really worked out perfectly. The original reason I tried this cream was that I have decided to switch to organic skin care after the cancer diagnosis of a close friend of mine. From my experience of a few other organic brands a few years back I was prepared that switching to organic will probably be a compromise. I was wrong! This cream is amazing, and in fact much better than most of the high end brands I have used before. And MUCH cheaper! But even if it was the same price it would worth it. I was honestly surprised. I love both this and their day cream, both are very hydrating and this one also smells great (daycream smells OK but not my favorite). I started using these at the same time so not sure which one but one of them also works wonders on fine lines.</li>
    <li> The customer service team was kind enough to send me a sample prior to purchasing. I must say, this is the most amazing cream I have ever used! I am no longer stuck on Clinique! The product absorbs effortlessly and doesnt leave an oily residue and 1 wake up with flawless, glowing skin. I have very sensitive skin and was worried that I would either breakout or have some sort of allergic reaction; however, this was not the case. My skin quickly adapted to the new product and I didnt experience any adverse effects. For those with sensitive skin, this is an amazing product that you can feel confident using.</li>
    <li> I had melasma from my last pregnancy despite slathering myself in sunscreen. I used the Aqua*Tica cream in conjunction with the Q*Lumiere and within a couple of months, my skin was back to normal. My skin looks really even and smooth and I love the scent. I have found that a little goes a long way, so a container will last you for quite some time. I adore Sweetsation Therapy&#x27;s products, not only are the ingredients safe for pregnancy and breastfeeding, but they actually work!</li>
    <li> Love this luscious cream! It is definitely hydrating and moisturizing all night. In the winter, I use it during the day as well (since I&#x27;m inside all day). Love it! Will always keep a supply on hand.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for natural and preservative( paraben and phalates ) free skin care  products for a while and found Sweetsation and decided to try it.  I have combination skin and loved Aqua*Tica Organic Botanical Night Cream\\&quot; and I can definitely see a well rested me in the morning with brighter even skin tone and less visible forehead wrinkles.  I also use the \\&quot;Q*Lumière Organic Day crème with Cucumber\\&quot;. I kept my skin even hydrated without making it oily. I like the packaging too as a little bit comes out with one pump which is enough for the entire face and neck. I highly recommend both product and will buy them again.</li>
    <li> Aquatica is a water for your face. Very hydrating and you can literally feel how it feeds your skin. Very luxury. I had a bit of sun patches/discoloration of the left side of my face from driving my car and sun blasting from the window and after using this cream for a while my skin tends to be more even. I used it also in combination with Sweetsation&#x27;s Sun*Si&#x27;Belle SPF 30 during the day. My skin is noticebly more bright and even now. I am getting addicted to their products.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this night cream with other Sweetsation products that I purchased, and my initial reaction is that it felt ok on my skin, when I first applied it, it had a mentholly feel on my face. It just slighly tingled (kind of like a minty chapstick on your lips, but less intense) the feeling slowly went away. It smells herbally and I do like that its all natural. I just don&#x27;t like the feeling it gave me initially, and its a bit creamier than I prefer.</li>
    <li> love this night cream. Ordered the eye cream, got a sample of Q&#x27;Lumiere day cream, so went back to get that and read reviews about Aqua Tica. softens skin, espec winter dry skin.  no samples this time though  :(</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream that I have used to date.  I love that it has natural ingredients.  Makes my face soft and silky, smells wonderful. Completely happy.</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream. It absorbs quickly, and I don&#x27;t get any dry patches. My only complaint is that I really hate the container it&#x27;s in. I always feel like there&#x27;s bound to be some cream in there that the pump didn&#x27;t pump out and there&#x27;s no way to open it. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great...</li>
    <li> Great night time moisturizer! I would mix a this with their serum and the next morning my skin would look and feel great!</li>
    <li> This is lovely, light cream and goes very well over the skin whitening repair. I use jit nightly.  I also use the eye cream at night.  Wish they had an eye gel as well since most creams seem to make my mascara run.</li>
    <li> I am 39 yrs. old and have used expensive high end creams of all brands, but this cream I am going to continue to buy. I ordered a sample and I really like how it not only smells, but how it feels on my skin, and most of all how my skin has reacted to it, I wake up with a clearer complexion (dark spots are less noticeable)and it makes my face more youthful. I really like that it is a natural product, I am happy I came across these products I have been recommending them to my friends, because they recently asked what I was using!</li>
    <li> First of all- I do NOT work for Sweetsation Therapy.  I wish I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently moved from San Francisco- born and raised- to Colorado.  SF has an average temperature of 53 or so degrees, and the humidity there rarely drops below 50%.  Even on a clear, warm, sunny day, the air has a lot of moisture in it because of the City&#x27;s proximity to the ocean.  Colorado- so far- has weather that reminds me of Orange County.  VERY warm [yep- I was surprised] and EXTREMELY [to me, horrifyingly] dry.  SF&#x27;s highest elevated point is about 950 feet above sea level; here, I am 6,000 feet above sea level.  And the sun here is- relentless.  I love it here but after a long life of soothing, moisturizing fog and a gentle sun, it was quite a shock to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has always been pretty good, and being in the beauty business myself and doing a lot of research on products and ingredients [and having good genes] people would guess my age as 15 or more years younger than I am.  I never used foundation, just concealer and powder.  My skincare routine was basic: cleanser, toner, moisturizer, and weekly masks.  I had a pretty good regimen, and continued to use it after my move.  [The only true beauty &#x27;secret&#x27;?  SUNSCREEN- a broad-spectrum one- a teaspoon for the face and neck.  Every day.  Untreated window glass lets in UVA and other UV frequencies, too. Topical treatment can only do so much, but sunscreen will prevent the damage of photo-aging.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, my skin resembled 000 sandpaper after about two weeks of being here.  I was taken aback at this metamorphosis, but thought hey- I can fix this.  I have sold cosmetics, and purchased treatment for decades.  I have tried almost every new product I read about, and have even tried making my own skin care.  My SF skin care no longer cut it, so I spent hundreds of dollars- and I am not wealthy- trying to help my red, tight, dull, sun damaged, scratchy skin.  I invested in pricey Colorado made treatment lines the locals swore by.  I scoured health food stores and bought product after product.  I tried shea butter; coconut oil; jojoba oil; serums; &#x27;deep&#x27; moisturizing masks; I tried exfoliating, and not exfoliating.  I drank gallons of water and bought two humidifiers and took a ton of fish oil and vitamin D [I still do those things- here, you kind of have to.]  Nothing worked.  Product would just NOT moisturize my skin.  I would wake up with a layer of treatment on my face, hoping for a change for the better.  Serums with night cream with humidifier- didn&#x27;t work.  Nothing absorbed, and my face felt two sizes too small and was still splotchy and rough under my face-full of stuff.  My skin just kept getting worse.  It got to where I dreaded looking in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a search on Amazon for &#x27;organic skin care&#x27; and Sweetsation Therapy products popped up.  If you aren&#x27;t familiar with the website &#x27;Skin Deep&#x27; you should check it out.  They break down cosmetics and treatment by ingredient and give the products a rating according to their toxicity.  Yes- toxicity.  Just because the FDA approves something doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s &#x27;good&#x27; for your skin or body.  Sweetsation Therapy was started by an awesome woman named Natalja who, when pregnant, realized she wanted to use the healthiest products for her baby and for herself.  All Sweetsation Therapy products get great reviews for safety on Skin Deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to order the &#x27;Bright Me Up&#x27; kit from Sweetsation, as, being a Black Irish San Franciscan, my skin was just getting nuked by the sun.  Big brown splotches appeared on my cheeks, especially on my left side of my face exposed to more sun from driving.  I CAN&#x27;T tan, and skin cancer runs in the family.  I won&#x27;t review all of the products in the kit here but I was impressed by them all.  After ONE USE of the cleanser, followed by the toner, and especially the Very Berry Organic Oxygen Masque &amp; Scrub, my skin felt better, and it looked better.  But the star product for me, which I wish came in a gallon size, is the Aqua*Tica Organic Botanical Night Cream.  I received a sample size in my order and- oh my gosh.  I had not realized how thirsty, how parched my skin really was until I used it.  My skin literally drank it in.  After ONE application, I checked my face in a magnifying mirror.  The redness was gone.  The little lines under my eyes- I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, and I&#x27;m 40 something [I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen since I was 11] had diminished.  But what my skin felt most of all was RELIEF.  My face didn&#x27;t feel two sizes too small, for the first time in months.  I placed an order for a full size IMMEDIATELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used some VERY expensive products- Creme de la [  ], all the big lines- I used to work in a department store that had a huge cosmetics department, and I tried everything.  I bought all those organic serums and masques et al and- nothing- NOTHING- has ever, EVER worked as well, and as fast, as this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I don&#x27;t like the scent.  It has an herbal scent that is too sharp for me.  [It dissipates quickly.]  I like fruity scents.  But you know what?  Now, I LOVE the scent, because it says: I am here, and I&#x27;m going to help you.  This may all sound a little crazy but when you see your skin go from what people perceived as early thirties to nuked, lifeless, splotchy, and painfully dry- believe me, you&#x27;re gonna love a product that helps that much, and right away.  The other con is that as I previously mentioned I wish it came in a larger size.  My skin just DRINKS this stuff in.  That said, a tiny bit goes a long way.  A pea-sized dab is enough for your face and neck. The price point, for the quality of this product, is a bargain.  You will love, love, love this line, and especially this product.  Save yourself the $$ I ended up spending and try this first.  And the ingredient list?  Good stuff- and a lot of it.  Check out Skin Deep. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hints:  apply while your face is still damp after cleansing/toning [her C*Perfect Skin Organic Foaming Face Cleanser with Enzymes, Antioxidants &amp; Vitamin C, and C*Bella Organic Brightening Toner with Vitamin C and Enzymes are FANTASTIC] and use a bit more on very rough/red patches i.e. dryness at the sides of the nose, etc. and press/pat the product in to the skin.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of this cream; I was using more than I needed to because I was so used to nothing working.  Believe me- this stuff WORKS.  I have very sensitive skin, too, and it was just improved- and soothed- by her products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way- the customer service at Sweetsation Therapy is second to none.  I called to check on my order and got voice mail, so I left a message- I think it was on a Sunday- and the owner of the company herself called me back.  She is amazing.  And you can tell she loves what she does and loves her customers.  And we love her.  And- thanks to this line- I now love my skin!  By the way- I had my car stereo worked on last week, and I asked the tech for an analog, &#x27;phonograph-y&#x27; sound if possible.  &#x27;Us oldies like that stuff,&#x27; I joked.  He looked at me for a moment.  I thought he didn&#x27;t know what I was asking him for, but he did.  &#x27;You&#x27;re not old,&#x27; he said.  &#x27;You&#x27;re my age.&#x27;  &#x27;How old are you?&#x27; I asked.  &#x27;Thirty one,&#x27; he answered.  Oh, gosh...  Thanks, Sweetsation Therapy!  :)t for me, which I wish came in a gallon size, is the Aqua*Tica Organic Botanical Night Cream.  I received a sample size in my order and- oh my gosh.  I had not realized how thirsty, how parched my skin really was until I used it.  My skin literally drank it in.  After ONE application, I checked my face in a magnifying mirror.  The redness was gone.  The little lines under my eyes- I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, and I&#x27;m 40 something [I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen since I was 11] had diminished.  But what my skin felt most of all was RELIEF.  My face didn&#x27;t feel two sizes too small, for the first time in months.  I placed an order for a full size IMMEDIATELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used some VERY expensive products- Creme de la [  ], all the big lines- I used to work in a department store that had a huge cosmetics department, and I tried everything.  I bought all those organic serums and masques et al and- nothing- NOTHING- has ever, EVER worked as well, and as fast, as this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I don&#x27;t like the scent.  It has an herbal scent that is too sharp for me.  [It dissipates quickly.]  I like fruity scents.  But you know what?  Now, I LOVE the scent, because it says: I am here, and I&#x27;m going to help you.  This may all sound a little crazy but when you see your skin go from what people perceived as early thirties to nuked, lifeless, splotchy, and painfully dry- believe me, you&#x27;re gonna love a product that helps that much, and right away.  The other con is that as I previously mentioned I wish it came in a larger size.  My skin just DRINKS this stuff in.  That said, a tiny bit goes a long way.  A pea-sized dab is enough for your face and neck. The price point, for the quality of this product, is a bargain.  You will love, love, love this line, and especially this product.  Save yourself the $$ I ended up spending and try this first.  And the ingredient list?  Good stuff- and a lot of it.  Check out Skin Deep.

    <li> Works as it claims but takes time .I started seeing results after a month of use.</li>
    <li> The consistency of this Night Cream is light.  The scent is fresh. And the Results arre very good.  Every morning I wake up after using this Night Cream, I feel like I just came out of a facial.  I have used La Mer for years and this Cream even though the consistency is completely different the results are just about the same.  Great Value also!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product after being given a sample &amp; so far I am impressed! Love the smell, so clean &amp; natural, and does not feel heavy or oily on my face like most night cremes.</li>
    <li> I have been in search of a new skin care regimen for a little while now and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the whole Sweetsation Therapy products. Their products are the best. The Botanical night cream has been doing wonders on my skin. It has helped me with my acne scars, sun spots and blemishes. I even go without makeup sometimes since my skin looks so amazing. I have been using their day cream, eye treatment, the mask and toner and every single product has helped changed the appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;And the fact that it is organic and without any chemicals is also a huge factor since my skin is so sensitive.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 products from them about 2 months ago. AquaTica Organic Botanical Night Cream, I Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment, and Q Lumiere Organic Day Cream. My issues are not so much with the quality of the products. I love the creams. They smell divine, and keep my skin moisturized without making my sensitive skin break out or feel oily. I couldn&#x27;t stop talking about the products and recommended it to several friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an issue with the packaging breaking after using it for a month , but they were quick to reply and replace the item and always nice in the emails we exchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love their attention to keeping a customer happy and the free samples that come with the order are an extra nice touch.</li>
    <li> I really love this night cream.  This is the second one I bought.  It is a good consistency.  Thicker than the Day Cream but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and oily.  It&#x27;s wonderful to just be able to put it on and go to bed without fear of getting my pillow all messy.  I love that it&#x27;s made with organic ingredients.  When you&#x27;re putting something on your skin every day, you want it to be something gentle and healthy.  A little goes a long way with this stuff.  It took me three months to have to buy another one--and that&#x27;s with daily use.  My skin feels so soft and clear when I wake up.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best skincare line I have experienced. I am 35 and have started showing fine lines.  And I didn&#x27;t want to use &#x27;chemicals&#x27; or other department brands as I have in the past anymore.  I gave this a try without any expectations.  I started noticing reduced fine lines as compared to 3 other recent &#x27;natural&#x27; brands that I have tried and almost elimination of my sunspots/freckles from the sun, which other people have noticed also.  And it all happened within the first couple weeks to using them.  Other things I noticed was a more softer and dewy skin also.  I am just very happy that I finally found something that works and is healthy for me.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> I started to search for creams that could help with aging skin AND were organic and have been so happy with Aqua*Tica Organic Botanical Night Cream.  The smell is heavenly, clean and light and the cream is not too thick that you feel as if your pores are being  clogged.  I have tried others and keep returning to use this at night.  it is fabulous!</li>
    <li> Smells pleasant and very hydrating.  Can&#x27;t say I have seen a huge difference in my skin but I love the ingredient list, it moisturizes well so I&#x27;ll stick with it.  Am now trying the serum as well.  Seller sends samples of other products in the line to try.</li>
    <li> Living in Texas, it kills me to be out in the sun! When I use this at night it very much soothes my skin and I also have dry skin, so the creamy texture and moisturing ingredients helps it get better! I also drink a lot of water, so that helps too. But what really made me happy was when my co-worker told me that my face was in great condition. She liked how smooth and clear my skin was, and wondered what I was using. My skin feels more youthful and soft, so I love using this as well as the Q&#x27;Lumiere Organic Day crème. They both treat my skin well, and I will probably always use their products since I can&#x27;t find any moisturizer with organic products as great as these! I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin. :)</li>
    <li> No matter how hectic my day has been, I cannot skip my nightly facial routine because this product does wonders to my skin the next morning. My skin feels healthy, hydrated, and glowing. Definately will repurchase this item again once this bottle is done!</li>
    <li> I was in the market to try something all natural. I needed a moisturizer that would help diminish my dark spots on my face and take care of my dry areas. Decided to give this a try. So glad that I did. Im on my second bottle now. It did take at least 1 1/2-2 months before I started to see results but that happens with all products that help with dark spots. Now my problem area of dark spots is very miniscule...Barely can see it. This bottle lasted me a very good amount of time. Probably 3+ months. I use it once in the morning and once at night. Smells therapeutic.  It did take a few weeks for me to get used to the smell because most of my moisturizers do not have a scent but overall its a nice pleasant scent. Its not greasy and sinks into the skin fairly quickly.  When you get to the last drop you really do get the last drop. The pump emptys out all of the product which is very nice. Absolutely pleased with this product. This is my holy grail moisturizer now. Thanks so much for making a wonderful product. Now i know why your products get such great reviews!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different night creams and this by far is the best night cream in the market. Some people seem to not like the smell but i love it. When i wake up in the morning my skin looks 10X better than it used to look before. Im so impressed with this product im thinking about buying it as a gift for my sister. Try it, you will love it:)</li>
    <li> This product leaves me with the smoothest, clearest skin.  Way better than then overpriced chemical department store garbage.  Another excellent product from Sweetsation.  Everything that I have tried from this company has exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> I purchased the night cream, eye cream and serum and used them diligently for at least two months.  I was initially very excited to find organic products that promised results and were safe for use during pregnancy, the reviews on these products are excellent as well.  I&#x27;ll start with the night cream - smells strongly botanical but is very creamy, definitely moisturizing, did not make me break out.  The serum smells pretty strongly, but is overall nice.  A little goes a long way and this spreads evenly and dries quickly, I used this twice per day.  The eye cream smells good and also goes on very creamy.  The good - I still have a lot of these products left after two months, they last a long time.  The bad - my skin has not gotten any better and may have gotten worse since switching from a big name brand.  I can actually see wrinkles on my forehead where there were none before.  I wanted to like this brand so badly, but sadly to say, I will not be repurchasing due to the lack of results I saw, which I was surprised at since the reviews are so glowing.</li>
    <li> If you look in my history, I do not bother with writing reviews, even if I sometimes like them. But this time I was prompted to write because I was contacted by the sweet people at Sweetsations who paid attention to me and my purchasing history (their customer) and asked me to write about my experience with their products given my almost weekly orders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am giving this product a 5 star because I am on my sencond bottle and I am in constant awe of what this night creme delivers. Then again, all the other products I get from them are on par with this one so they each deserve a rating of 5. Certainly, I am using almost the entire Sweetsation line at this point, but this night cream was amongst the first things I ordered from them and also the decisive moment of becoming a sweetsation customer. From the perfect packinging and consistant inclusion of a new sample each time I order something (sample that becomes my next order, may I add), to the friendly design of the bottles, and least but not last -by any means- the quality of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that my skin has issues, but I am 33 and started noticing some fine lines appearing around my eyes, some pigmentation in the same area, and a few dry patches on my forehead and my cheecks. I used this creme twice, with some extraordinary and unexpected results. I&#x27;ve been using this cream from several months now, and if on one night I don&#x27;t have access to it...let&#x27;s just say I am not too happy. Addictive? I don&#x27;t know if the use of such strong word is appropriate but I love it so much, I just crave it. My skin tone is perfectly even (no foundation powder or face make-up of any kind is required), I am noticing a dramatic decrease in the appearance of those pores which after the age of 30 are starting to look like tiny face craters, and skin so smooth, I can&#x27;t stop touching my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, I have created a strict regimen for my beauty routine: wash my face with the foaming soap (my husband actually said &amp;#34;I think I fell in love with this cleanser&amp;#34; - and he&#x27;s using it too :), a few drops of toner, then a combo of ilift and brightning eye around my eyes, lumi essence on top of that for brightining my skin, and lastly the beautiful Aquatica night cream. Once every 3 days or so I switch it up a little, by using the berry mask, then foaming cleanser, toner, micro-needling and la nouvelle hyaluronic acid, with a finish of yet again, this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this might seem like a tedious process especially considering the fact that I am not that old nor is my skin too banged up (I have a personal vendetta with the sun and so I maintain my skin, sheet white as some may say - no tanning EVER). Either way, I love my skin, the way it looks now more than ever, the compliments - cause nodoby said I was ranking high on modesty lol- and the confidence that I can and do look fabulous. And some of the words I use here may seem girgly girl, yet I assure you, I am quite the tomboy. And who said tomboys don&#x27;t enjoy treating themseves and looking gorgeous while climing trees?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, if you ever catch me in a shopping area, I power walk through the cosmetic deprtaments because ABSOLUTELY nothing satisfies, in my opinion. Pure, organic, ingredients made here at home for prices accessible even by my mother-in-law who likes to complain about money all the time?! This is the best for me, and it could be the best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I am moving out of state and had to go through the dreaded cosmetic cabinet biopsy: may I just say that 90 % of eveything I owned -cosmetic wise- found a new home in the trash bin. The rest of 10% is split 9 to sweetsation and 1% misc . So bam, I was able to get two birds in one stone too. How you like them apples? :) hahand actually said &amp;#34;I think I fell in love with this cleanser&amp;#34; - and he&#x27;s using it too :), a few drops of toner, then a combo of ilift and brightning eye around my eyes, lumi essence on top of that for brightining my skin, and lastly the beautiful Aquatica night cream.

    <li> I love this cream. It feels very, well...aquatic and hydrating on my skin. Very comforting and nourishing. I always look forward to applying it before going to bed. It relaxes me. Scent is very relaxing.</li>
    <li> Sweetsation therapy products are truly the healthiest. I have tried every over the counter product available only to find eventually they burned my eyes, or made matters worse. I came across these products on accident, however it was a great accident.     I am 33 years old, not pregnant, an avid bike rider, and live in the hot state of florida. Being in the sun all day takes a toll on you. I began using the sweetsation spf30 and spf50 products  for when I ride my bike, and to a great surpise they do not wash off with the heat or sweat. Not to mention the ingredients are truly organic with no chemicals. NOt many people understand the effects of chemicals, but eventually they all will enter your bloodstream and potentially cause damage.     The night cream is super hydrating, not greasy at all, which is a great bonus. It has a light mild fragrance, but its a natural fragrance. When you put it on immedietly you feel and see a difference. I didn&#x27;t even expect to see a different using any of the sweetsation products, I just wanted sun protection and something for after the sun. HOwever, the second you put it on, your face must really like it because you see a difference that almost takes your skin back years. The plus is it is all natural. If you are someone who uses moisturizers regular, stop with the high end products and over the counter products, they really are full of chemicals and dont do anything for you, but perhaps cause more damage.    Yes, the price is a little higher, however, they actually cost less because you need much less, literetly a pea size will cover your entire face. In the end, the health benefits and cost outwiegh any product available on the market.     The best part of this product line is the customer service. I contacted the company a few weeks ago with a question about the spf30. The owner emailed me back an hour later on a saturday evening with helpful tips and suggestions. She is really kind and understands we all work hard for our money.It is not often you will get the owner of any company to return your questions, but she really cares, and it is obvious she cares about your needs over making profit. I am a doctorate learner, almost finished, and as such I read people while. This company is one of a kind, and should be highly rated as such.     If your using one of the products and have a simple question like I did, email customer service on the sweetsation website. You will get an immediete response. I am not very girly, so I felt kind of silly with my question, but she did not make me feel such and helped greatly.    You wont regret buying from this line, and I assure you customers needs are priority.</li>
    <li> Great nighttime cream. A little goes a long way. My skin feels nourished and healthy. I use this every night, and I wake up feeling as though my skin is still soft and not dry at all. I love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
    <li> This is my go to night time face cream that is good all year round. I started using Sweetsation products when I was pregnant with my first child and I know this is what cleared up my hormonal acne! Every product I have tried I have fallen in love with. I kept using the products even after I was pregnant and now that I am pregnant again there isn&#x27;t anything else I would use. I noticed a clearer, subtle and more radiant complexion after using this night cream. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of \\&quot;high end\\&quot; full of ugly chemicals creams and serums and finally decided to check EWG for more natural organic line... After a few misshaps I came acroos Sweetsation Therapy and now I am absolutely hooked.  My skin never looked better after only using these products for under a month.  It&#x27;s simpy amazing!! Not only they feel good but also great for your skin.  Everything from this line is amazing!!  Can&#x27;t wait to order their new organic eye cream :)!!</li>
    <li> It can pretty dry during the winter time so I use this as a day lotion and its perfect! It goes on smoothly and is not heavy or greasy. Its a great moisturizer and it smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream, it is a little thicker than the day cream , and my skin feel very hydrated and fresh in the morning. I like to know that I am not putting any harsh chemicals or perfumes in my face that might damage skin or expose me to some toxins.</li>
    <li> I liked this product to start with.  My skin gets pretty dry in the winter so I read the reviews and gave this one a try.  Most of my skin felt pretty good, but I did get breakouts in my t-zone, which is my problem area.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love Sweetsation products and Aqua*Tica Night Cream is a winter time skin saver. I have used this while nursing, pregnant and non-hormonal with great glowing skin results. It is the only product that immediately relieves my dry chapped skin without any burning or irritation. Plus the scent is wonderfully calming and the package size is double what you get with drugstore stuff, making it way more affordable. I live in the dry desert climate of Phoenix Arizona and Aqua*Tica is a life saver! If you have any skin sensitivities or just want to use more natural skin friendly products, this is the best I&#x27;ve found (and I&#x27;ve done my share of looking!).</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying I never write reviews of products. I love this product. It is very soothing and seems to have a sortof plumping effect. I have VERY sensitive skin. Pretty much breaks out at the site of skincare products. I have tried everything from Crème De La Mer to drugstore brands and I love this brand!! I wish I had know about it during my 3 pregnancies when my skin was a disaster!  And every time I order and they send a sample I get hooked on a new product. Good thing is the products are reasonably priced for the amount of product you get and a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Silky against the skin, and the smell is wonderfully soothing. (My sig other loves it too!) One of my favorites from a company I trust to provide effective all-natural skin care.</li>
    <li> I like this night cream because it&#x27;s lightly scented and absorbs really well into my skin.  Great natural organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, but I am impressed by the difference in my skin. I feel I look brighter and more refreshed every morning. It was very important to me to find a brand that is organic and natural, I love the fact that I can use this product even while I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
    <li> I originally found Sweetsation Therapy for their safe and effective sunscreens (EWG), when I was pregnant with my daughter and wanted to use only very safe skincare products. I LOVE their sunscreens, and ordered a few different ones to try. They sent samples of other products with each of my orders, and I love free samples! Aqua*Tica was one of those samples - I tried it the night I received it and was immediately hooked. Though I absolutely loved the scent of the Q*Lumiere instantly, I didn&#x27;t swoon over the fragrance in this at first - not that I disliked it, but I was sort of indifferent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only took me a few days of using this every night (and Q*Lumiere every day) to notice a real difference in my skin. I have really dry, VERY sensitive skin. So many products rich enough to offer ample hydration at night are greasy or thick feeling. And I often end up having dry or irritated patches from other products. Not with this. It is creamy and easily absorbed, and perfectly balances the moisture content in my skin, to make it smooth and soft. And I swear, it seems to minimize fine lines also. And now that I associate this stuff with fantastic skin (and going to bed!) I am no longer indifferent to the scent, I LOVE the scent!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua*Tica is even better than many, much more expensive night creams that I have tried. I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to recommend the C*Bella brightening toner. I tried it shortly after trying the Aqua*Tica and Q*Lumiere, and again, am hooked on it! It is absolutely the best toner I have every used, after cleansing both morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am a Sweetsation Therapy devotee. It is sooo great to find products that are not only SAFE, but also REALLY do wonders for your skin. That is a combination that is not easy to come by.</li>
    <li> I just re-ordered this product. Feels great, smells great and works great. I’m 47 years old and my skin definitely looks better that before. Friends complimented and asked me whether I changed my products.  I was trying organic products for months and finally I found the RIGHT one. I’m thinking about trying the serum too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to my skincare. Spent many hours searching and even more $$ on products that didn&#x27;t do nearly as much as this moisturizer did. First is the smell - LOVE IT! It&#x27;s by far my favorite time of the evening; Wash my face, tone and apply the night cream. Goes on very smooth and feels so refreshing and healthy! You will be pleased to find your younger, brighter looking skin in the morning! I&#x27;m so happy with their line of products! Just placed an order for a body lotion, face wash and moisturizer/spf30. So excited to try those out too!</li>
    <li> i liked how rich this was and also the scent wasn&#x27;t overwhelming. Unfortunately it made my skin red and my eyes water. I do have sensitive skin so if you don&#x27;t this is probably a great winter cream, it&#x27;s rich without being greasy.</li>
    <li> its light, make skin looks fresh the next morning. i am using several products from their company and love them all and i appreciate their great customer service....</li>
    <li> This is a great night cream! It hydrates, without producing an oily feel. I have very sensitive skin and tend to have allergic reactions from most moisturizers - this moisturizer worked great for me. I have received multiple compliments on my skin since I began using the l*Light Eye Treatment, Q&#x27;Lumiere and Acqua*Tica Night Cream. I am very impressed with Sweetsation and plan on trying out more of their products!</li>
    <li> A thirst-quenching treat for my tired face right before bed!  It&#x27;s creamy, nourishing, and you can almost feel it working while you sleep.  My skin feels smooth and soft in the morning.  The scent is very organic and quite soothing as well!  A perfect compliment to my night time ritual!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Aqua*Tica Organic Night Cream!!  I received a sample of it when I placed an order for one of Sweetsation&#x27;s other products last month.  Once the sample was gone, I knew that I just had to order the full size because I love the way that it makes my skin look and feel.  Thank you Sweetsation Therapy for all of your wonderful products and also for the excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> I bought several of the Sweetsations products. This night cream has a very floral smell which normally I really don&#x27;t like because they give me headaches, but I have to say this was somewhat pleasant. I did find it too much fragrance for a facial product and my husband (also sensitive to smells) complained about it so keep that in mind if you have the same issue. This cream also burned my face as I do have somewhat sensitive skin. I ended up finishing it off as a body moisturizer. It held the moisture in and worked beautifully for that, but obviously the price vs size makes that idea not very economical. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this one.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite night cream!!  I am 6 months pregnant and wanted something all natural and safe for my growing baby.  Since using this night cream, my face is so smooth and I constantly have people telling me that I do not look my age.  :)  The smell takes me away each time I put it on.  I love it and will be giving it as a gift to my mother for Christmas this year.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products from Sweetsation.</li>
    <li> I tried sample, felt it smelled a little bit strong, still ordered it because I am a great fan of organic products and really like other Sweetsation Therapy products, and I do need a night cream :)</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have tried different organic creams, and this is my favorite</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing. I found it to be very light for a night cream (which surprised me because past, night creams I used have been heavy/greasy) smells heavenly, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my dry/sensitive skin. I put just a bit on before bed and wake up with moisturized (but again, not greasy), fresh skin.  I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with my purchase of this cream and will absolutely be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Sweetsation has a phenomenal skin care line. I have sensitive skin, I tend to break out once a month due to hormones and I was looking for a product that was natural. I found it with sweetsation. This particular lotion is great, it’s mild, it dosnt leave my skin feeling greasy and my face looks brighter and healthier. I have combo skin and at night I needed a product that left my skin feeling well hydrated. I absolutely love it. My skin is never irritated and I don’t break out from any of there skin care products.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the organic and natural skin care product without artificial colorants, fragrances and harsh chemicals, like formaldehyde, phthalates and parabens, when I found this night cream from Sweetsation. Main ingredients of the cream are natural plant juices and oils and it nourishes my sensitive, dry skin very well. The cream is very rich so there is no need to use much, it goes smoothly on my face, and it has a very pleasant scent of lavender. Because it is so rich, it takes a few minutes to be absorbed, but it is not a problem for me at all, since it is a night cream. When I use this product I feel like I receive two benefits at once: the nourishment for my skin and the treatment with aromatherapy for a restful night sleep.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by my sister and I am in love too!!! Smells awesome, very lite and feels fresh on your skin. My order also included a free trial of the serum so I am very pleased with both products. Will be a loyal customer forever!!!!</li>
    <li> I have recently discovered the Sweetsation line of products, and I really like them.  I haven&#x27;t been using them for very long, but there are several things I like about them.  I like that they&#x27;re organically made.  I love the consistency of this night cream, not thick or greasy.  And the price is very affordable.  So far, I have been very impressed and will continue to update on the products the longer that I use them.</li>
    <li> This night cream leaves my face feeling super soft and smooth. I wake up in the morning with a dewy, even complexion. The fact that it is an organic product is just the icing on the cake. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A great night cream. Filled with high end herbal and natural ingredients found in department&lt;br /&gt;Store brands at a fraction of the price. Has an interesting smell, kinda&lt;br /&gt;Minty, but what it does for your skin is well worth it. My only skin care&lt;br /&gt;Product of choice now .</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite face cream! I love how all the ingredients are familiar -- no weird chemicals -- and it includes a variety of superfoods! My skins looks great and I feel good about my purchase. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this night cream. my skin is acne prone but this does not break me out. I also love the scent too, it&#x27;s like essential oil. The consistency is not too thick and my skin absorbs it quickly then my skin will feel soft. I like how my skin feels in the morning. I also appreciate the dispenser design. I hate dipping my finger into a jar. This pump gives me just the right amount every time and it feels sanitary. I&#x27;m a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> This is the last step of my day and it makes me feel good when I touch my skin in the morning.  I started using Sweetasation products after I delivered my baby.  And now I am using a full line of Sweetsation products.  I was looking for skincare products that are effective and safe.  I am happy that I found Sweetsation.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because of the positive reviews, however I haven&#x27;t been able to use it enough because of it&#x27;s unpleasant smell. Haven&#x27;t used product to give an accurate review.</li>
    <li> The product is not oily but rather fresh &amp; calming. Feeling comfortable wearing all night long &amp; it&#x27;s good for organic mommy to be &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Extremely hydrating but light at the same time. Best organic and natural cream my wife has found so far. Would be great if they sold a bigger size though (hint hint).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: their bottle design is amazing. I opened up the lotion bottle after it was all empty trying to get the last dredges remaining inside, but the design was so good that it had already dispensed every last drop!</li>
    <li> So i&#x27;ve used lumi-essence and this night cream. I think I generally need both because of the different textures. This night cream is creamy and I find it to be just the right thickness for the night; especially given my acne prone skin. It helps prevent flakiness and dryness that results form acne medications. Love it and plan to order some more!</li>
    <li> so far so good, a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Good to use during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommended it to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I just looooove it! My skin looks much better now!&lt;br /&gt;No dryness, no gloss..and my skin became so soft!&lt;br /&gt;But one thing which I don&#x27;t like..it&#x27;s smell..but it just my taste.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to buy this cream!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this cream alot. U will notice in the morning how this cream works nicely during night time . Just i don&#x27;t like it smell , but i like the way it take care of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sure i&#x27;ll buy it again .&lt;br /&gt;Om Abdulaziz</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, but I am impressed by the difference in my skin. I feel I look brighter and more refreshed every morning. It was very important to me to find a brand that is organic and natural. I also used the day cream and the whitening repair one. They are amazing.</li>
    <li> I am confident that this is the best night cream on the market. I have tried many lotions over the years, from name-brand otc lotions to all natural homemade remedies. All you  need to do is read the ingredient list of this lotion, and you will see that it blows the competition out of the water. It&#x27;s way more affordable than the name-brand stores that sell fancy face creams, and yet the product itself is way better. My face feels soft and smooth after just two days of usage. Serious, two days.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! My mom bought it first and I tried some of hers. I used it once..and I was hooked. I have very sensitive and dry skin. This is the perfect moisture kick my skin needs and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin. The smell is divine. Buy this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This night cream is really awesome I have been using  this cream for almost  a year now but all I can say thank you for making this product A part of my life now , I really look great and younger as ever hehehehhe.</li>
    <li> As a physician, despite knowing the benefits a lot of chemical substances provide, I think there&#x27;s nothing better than natural, organic ingredients for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells and feels so good that for the first time, I enjoy taking care of my skin. A little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly on my skin. I’ve been using this product for a few months now and I can honestly say that this is the first time I see positive changes on my skin.</li>
    <li> Im in love with Sweetsation products, Beside being organic, they smell amazing and it feels really good on the skin. I&#x27;m addicted to it .</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweetsation Therapy skin care products for approximately a year and am extremely happy with every product I have purchased.  Aqua*Tica Organic Botanical Night Cream keeps my sensitive/combination skin hydrated and smooth.  It has a clean fresh scent and, since one pump covers my face and neck, 2 oz. lasts a very long time.  I love this skin care line because it&#x27;s organic - no toxic ingredients.  I&#x27;m 62 years old and have tried one skin care line after another because I&#x27;ve never been satisfied.  I have finally found a line that works and is completely safe.  I won&#x27;t be looking any more!  Another benefit of using Sweetsation products is the excellent customer service.  When you call the 800 number, Natalia will most likely answer the telephone.  How many other companies can you call and actually speak directly to the founder?</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Saw results after a few days of using. Not thick and sticky.</li>
    <li> Nice feel, but strong perfume smell.  I am sensitive to odors and could not take it.  The company was easy to deal with and took it back.  I only used it a few times, so can&#x27;t comment on its efficacy.</li>
    <li> I So LOVE this night creme...it smells so fresh and real and it has such a restorative feeling on my 60 year young skin...I work Really hard as a Realtor and long days showing property and helping people with their needs...I like to get home after 10-12 hours, ...you know and then ...wash my face with this foaming wash...an another incredible product...use the Cucumber toner....WOW....use the serum ....WOW and put this Amazing Night creme on my face...I DESERVE it...so thanks sweetsation for coming into my life 6 months ago...I won&#x27;t ever stop using Your Products.... I&#x27;m  so grateful...words can only...... Hint at what I feel....P&amp;L&lt;br /&gt;sam fitz</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have serious problem skin. Acne, dry, oily - you name it. At 30 years old, its a tiresome chore dealing with this kind of skin - and I have to say that I tried this product and truly loved it. I&#x27;d never used a night cream before, and when this is used regularly you will see a big difference in your skins tone, suppleness and texture. Love it!</li>
    <li> My skin is super supple and smooth since I started using this product!!</li>
    <li> I do not really like the smell, I am also sensitive to smells, had no idea it would be so strong. Its not a light scent, its heavy and perfumy and gags me.  Update, if I dilute it slightly with water, it helps.  I do like the after effect, it does make my skin smoother, but the price is very high and I didn&#x27;t really like the smell. The ingredient list is impressive though.  I see there is another product with cucumber which I might try - I really wanted something with a lighter scent, this one was too much for me.</li>
