      <li>Just okay.  \\&quot;C\\&quot; at best.</li>
      <li>Bought it for my granddaughters, not the strongest or good instructions on how to use.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product</li>
      <li>Does have lots of attachments which is a good thing.</li>
      <li>but it won&#x27;t replace a good manicurist.</li>

      <li>Excellent value and quick ship.</li>
      <li>:) this is a great product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased the product!</li>
      <li>But by the time I&#x27;m done with their nails, I have to charge it before I can do my own.</li>
      <li>This item could be a nice gift.</li>
      <li>Had one many years ago and liked it much better.</li>
      <li>This product does a good job on keeping my toes clean and trimmed.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t ever used anything else, so I couldnt say whether it is better than others.</li>
      <li>,I sure she will tell me when she get around to it.</li>
      <li>IT LOVE</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t give many pros and cons either since I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>I have played with the many attachments but have to have the instructions nailed to my forehead to keep reading what each piece is called and what it does.</li>
      <li>OK I love theis set.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>The cuticle Stick is the only piece in here that&#x27;s not all that GREAT !!!</li>
      <li>I also love experimenting with the many attachments.</li>
      <li>It does not include a clipper, but those are available in most drug stores.</li>
      <li>We often don&#x27;t have time to go out and get our nails done, but having this product at home makes it very easy for us to give ourselves a quick home manicure or pedicure.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to use--</li>
      <li>My lady friend really liked this pedicure set, found it to meet her hygenic needs, her daughter also uses to do nail art for some of her girlfriends to make extra cash, good product.</li>
      <li>Me and my daughters truly enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>I enjoy mine.</li>
      <li>They are cheap and can&#x27;t help you with any toenail issues.</li>
      <li>Obvisouly it&#x27;s not the strongest most powerful drill out there.</li>
      <li>I am a happy and returning costumer, love love love revlon meni/pedi kit, had the old kit, overused it, bough a different one but not revlon cause couldn&#x27;t find one.</li>
      <li>Without it, my nails took forever to smooth down and keep looking nice and clean.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t see this being one of those products that will last many years, because it is just so cheaply made.</li>
      <li>My daughters (toddler and 4 year old) love it when I do their nails.</li>
      <li>and was completely worth the investment.</li>
      <li>Product is great for the price but the drills are weak &amp; easy to break.</li>
      <li>i can get my nails done right at home when i can&#x27;t get in for a touchup.</li>
      <li>I purchased it one because Revlon is a very reputable name, second the price was amazing compared to the mani/pedi sets I saw at other salon stores.</li>
      <li>A very reasonable price for a battery-powered system of files and buffers.  </li>
      <li>I am only glad I bought one to try myself, before wrapping and gifting a dud for Christmas presents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got a gift certificate for my birthday for Amazon and the first thing I thought was \\&quot;oh</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to shave off your nail as if it was a nail clipper.</li>
      <li>Really, none of them can do the job.</li>
      <li>I really do like it</li>
      <li>All pink plastic, looks more like a toy.</li>
      <li>not to mention the fast Delivery</li>
      <li>very low.so</li>
      <li>Easy use and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>This kit only works on a full battery charge.</li>
      <li>Recently lost enough weight to be able to reach them.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I do have to admit I do have super soft feet now after about an hour of work and trial and error of different tools.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product 10 years ago; it recently stopped working.  </li>
      <li>I miss my old kit!</li>
      <li>i can easily buy the replacement heads at walgreens or here on amazon for way less!</li>
      <li>Very pretty packaging in pink</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this to anyone who does nails professional.</li>
      <li>It loses power very quickly.</li>
      <li>Sad because, if it did work, I was going to buy two more for my nieces!</li>
      <li>I purchased this because during the summer months I am very athletic, and wear a lot of foot revealing shoes, so my callouses, are not very flattering, and I saw that this had various callous attachments.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to family and friends who&#x27;s willing to only pay $20 or less for a mani pedi set.</li>
      <li>At least with this item you will have a full pedicure &amp; manicure.</li>

<li> At least with this item you will have a full pedicure &amp; manicure.</li>
<li> So the downside I have found, is the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
<li> it was not very effective and is clearly an inferior version of similar products used in salons.  </li>
<li> In addition the tools are not marked in any way so who knows which disc is which.</li>
<li> I have been wanting a manicure set for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I have used it almost daily for myself on rough feet, nails and with my cats&#x27; nails.</li>
<li> This takes forever to charge, and doesn&#x27;t stay charged for long, and no you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in and that drives me nuts!</li>
<li> Well, here is the downfall, its made kinda like a Barbie toy, pink and plastic.</li>
<li> The motor is not strong enough and the filing, smoothing and polishing attachments do not accomplish anything.</li>
<li> This product is not worth purchasing...</li>
<li> I wish there&#x27;s less vibration on the handle.</li>
<li> I find the sanding files a little too harsh for my tender nails and the tools are a bit confusing, since there is one description on the box and a different one on the paperwork that comes with it.  </li>
<li> This manicure/pedicure kit has to be charged constantly which I found extremely irritating.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the battery charge does not last.</li>
<li> So you may think of giving yourself a manicure, but the charge is too weak and it just stops when it touches the nail.</li>
<li> I have really horrible toe nails, and have been spending too much money to have a podiatrist take care of them.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it can&#x27;t.</li>
<li> It is also very poorly made.</li>
<li> The handle does not work when plugged in :-(</li>
<li> i am disappointed.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have the papers very unhappy</li>

    <li> Used for granddaughters spa day.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use-- i like the cone attachments best. The handle does not work when plugged in :-( I wish there&#x27;s less vibration on the handle. This product does a good job on keeping my toes clean and trimmed. I would recommend this to family and friends who&#x27;s willing to only pay $20 or less for a mani pedi set.</li>
    <li> I have really horrible toe nails, and have been spending too much money to have a podiatrist take care of them.  Recently lost enough weight to be able to reach them.  I decided to look into buying the equipment I need to trim them myself, and found this.  A very reasonable price for a battery-powered system of files and buffers.  It does not include a clipper, but those are available in most drug stores.</li>
    <li> Just okay.  \\&quot;C\\&quot; at best. Not enough power.  Bought 2, one as a gift and returning the gift. Had one many years ago and liked it much better.</li>
    <li> Me and my daughters truly enjoy this product. We often don&#x27;t have time to go out and get our nails done, but having this product at home makes it very easy for us to give ourselves a quick home manicure or pedicure. I also love experimenting with the many attachments. I&#x27;m glad I purchased the product!</li>
    <li> This is a good product but I wished it worked while it is charging. Does have lots of attachments which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> This set is great for touch ups between nail appointments. I especially like the tool for cleaning under your nails. If you don&#x27;t have regular nail appointments this is a greay set for maintaining nails yourself. I enjoy mine.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a manicure set for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;I found it at Amazon and had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;It is everything I wanted. It works beautifuly.&lt;br /&gt;My nails look so beautiful because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this supplier to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love this set!!! I have used it almost daily for myself on rough feet, nails and with my cats&#x27; nails. Excellent value and quick ship.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth purchasing...it was not very effective and is clearly an inferior version of similar products used in salons.  In fact, I used it once and placed it in my \\&quot;garage sale\\&quot; box to sell.    The motor is not strong enough and the filing, smoothing and polishing attachments do not accomplish anything.</li>
    <li> So dissappointed that the drill does not turn or charge at all. Not what is appears to be or do. Sad because, if it did work, I was going to buy two more for my nieces! I am only glad I bought one to try myself, before wrapping and gifting a dud for Christmas presents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can I return this defected item?</li>
    <li> i am astounded, i thought this product was good, but there was problem with speed, practically speed was very low.so i am disappointed.</li>
    <li> OK I love theis set. :) Obvisouly it&#x27;s not the strongest most powerful drill out there. However, I&#x27;m just a Beginner so this drill is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would want one of those drills that the nail salons use anyway. YOU AREN&#x27;T DOING 10-20 PEOPLE HANDS A DAY. Everything in this kit works !!!! Made my In home pedicure turn out GREAT !!!! not to mention the fast Delivery :) this is a great product. It&#x27;s strong enough to shave off your nail as if it was a nail clipper. The cuticle Stick is the only piece in here that&#x27;s not all that GREAT !!! I plan to buy a steel cuticle remover one anyway. This is a great Product.</li>
    <li> My lady friend really liked this pedicure set, found it to meet her hygenic needs, her daughter also uses to do nail art for some of her girlfriends to make extra cash, good product.</li>
    <li> I was lost without this product.  I had one that lasted over 15 years.  Without it, my nails took forever to smooth down and keep looking nice and clean.  I got a gift certificate for my birthday for Amazon and the first thing I thought was \\&quot;oh my God, I bet they carry this\\&quot; and they did.  I ordered it that night and got it 4 days later.  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t ever used anything else, so I couldnt say whether it is better than others. I can&#x27;t give many pros and cons either since I have nothing to compare it to. My daughters (toddler and 4 year old) love it when I do their nails. But by the time I&#x27;m done with their nails, I have to charge it before I can do my own. So the downside I have found, is the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
    <li> I can&#x60;t tell you how it is ,it was a gift for a friend and I don&#x60;t know if has used it yet,I sure she will tell me when she get around to it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because during the summer months I am very athletic, and wear a lot of foot revealing shoes, so my callouses, are not very flattering, and I saw that this had various callous attachments. I purchased it one because Revlon is a very reputable name, second the price was amazing compared to the mani/pedi sets I saw at other salon stores.

This takes forever to charge, and doesn&#x27;t stay charged for long, and no you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in and that drives me nuts! I do have to admit I do have super soft feet now after about an hour of work and trial and error of different tools. It does do the trick but I don&#x27;t see this being one of those products that will last many years, because it is just so cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product 10 years ago; it recently stopped working.  It&#x27;s a great product for the price...I stand by it 100%.</li>
    <li> I am a happy and returning costumer, love love love revlon meni/pedi kit, had the old kit, overused it, bough a different one but not revlon cause couldn&#x27;t find one. Finally found a revlon kit and can&#x27;t get enough of it!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I am overly impressed but it does the job.  I find the sanding files a little too harsh for my tender nails and the tools are a bit confusing, since there is one description on the box and a different one on the paperwork that comes with it.  I really do like it but it won&#x27;t replace a good manicurist.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and a great size to travel with.  I use it every week and find that it contains everything I need to do my manicure.</li>
    <li> At least with this item you will have a full pedicure &amp; manicure. All pieces work perfectly and the color of the box is so cute! This item could be a nice gift.</li>
    <li> Great to use between manicures for people who have acrylic nails or gels.  Easy use and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and I can&#x27;t send it back I don&#x27;t have the papers very unhappy and it was a gift</li>
    <li> This kit only works on a full battery charge. It does not work with the power cord which is only for charging. Unfortunately the battery charge does not last. Then it has to be charged for 6 hours before it.can be used. So you may think of giving yourself a manicure, but the charge is too weak and it just stops when it touches the nail. It is also very poorly made. All pink plastic, looks more like a toy. In addition the tools are not marked in any way so who knows which disc is which. Garbage.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my granddaughters, not the strongest or good instructions on how to use.  Should also have replacement list</li>
    <li> All of the tools you will ever need to prim, file and polish all of your &amp;#34;20&amp;#34; nails.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> i can get my nails done right at home when i can&#x27;t get in for a touchup. it saves me time and money. and was completely worth the investment. its rechargable, and i can easily buy the replacement heads at walgreens or here on amazon for way less!</li>
    <li> Very pretty packaging in pink and it looks like it can do everything. Unfortunately, it can&#x27;t. I have played with the many attachments but have to have the instructions nailed to my forehead to keep reading what each piece is called and what it does. Really, none of them can do the job. You may have some luck doing your fingernails but none of the attachment can touch a pedicure. They are cheap and can&#x27;t help you with any toenail issues. This manicure/pedicure kit has to be charged constantly which I found extremely irritating. It loses power very quickly. I miss my old kit!</li>
    <li> Product is great for the price but the drills are weak &amp; easy to break. I would not recommend this to anyone who does nails professional.</li>
    <li> this should be taken off of the market. you cannot purchase replacement discs from the company because they do not make them.</li>
