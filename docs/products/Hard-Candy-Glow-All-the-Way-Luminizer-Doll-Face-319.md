      <li>This product is amazing  to use on ur facThish</li>
      <li>But this is a amazing product you def can do alot with it</li>
      <li>This product is kind of pricey on here</li>

      <li>Is a good product, I liked it very much.  </li>
      <li>Its large, so you get alot of product for a great price.</li>
      <li>u have nothing2 lose and a beautiful, soft glow 2 gain!!</li>
      <li>love it and speedy delivery</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE PRODUCT</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve choosed it because It&#x27;s famous</li>
      <li>I did find that it caused me to break out, not horribly</li>
      <li>I apply it in a letter C around my eye brown and top of my cheek bone.</li>
      <li>its okay</li>
      <li>However, I am wearing it now with a bronze and brown smokey eye and it looks lovely.</li>
      <li>more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
      <li>and it comes with a whole lot of product so its def worth it!!!!</li>
      <li>and you can put it so easily.</li>
      <li>my friends liked it so very much.</li>
      <li>I was very happy when they started selling their items in WALMART, for LESS than it was being sold in SEPHORA.</li>
      <li>This product is smooth and comforable and works well.</li>
      <li>advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it</li>
      <li>it is cheaper than Josie Maran Illuminizer but does the same thing, great price and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>It makes you look like you get a lot of fresh air in the country!</li>
      <li>My daughter was excited to receive this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great price compared to high end high lighters and for that it is a 5 star product.</li>
      <li>This item gets alot of \\&quot;KUDOS\\&quot; &amp; positive talk on YOUTUBE vids, but I have better brands of illuminator/</li>
      <li>, I would definitely recommend it for a nice glow on a special occasion.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure I will try other things because I liked this very much.</li>
      <li>Make sure to just use a tiny amount, you can always build.</li>
      <li>FOR THIS SORT OF PRODUCT; I SUSPECT MORE CREAM MAY BE LEFT IN THE TUBE THAN WAS EXTRACTED FROM IT.</li>
      <li>I use this with other skin glowing things, but this product works amazing on all skin tones.  </li>
      <li>I say this because if you use too much, the pink will not blend into a nice glow.</li>
      <li>they pretty much just take up space in my make up drawer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If I had spent the $15, not sure I&#x27;d be very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Not only you get a product so easy to use</li>
      <li>and it is more pink.</li>
      <li>And the price is reasonable</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>goes on nicely and leaves a soft glow nothing too flashy just nice</li>
      <li>Also, I used a small eye shadow brush to apply, and it looks really nice.</li>
      <li>but for next time i will look for better quality from the same type or another company .</li>
      <li>its pretty light irredesent pink shade flatters all skn tones!!</li>
      <li>What I love is that it just takes a little</li>
      <li>I got this product because I wanted to add a little more of a dewy glow to my make up once in a  while.</li>
      <li>While the pink fades mostly away, I&#x27;m not sure how it would look with certain other colors that bright cotton candy pink might not go with.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the majority of HARD CANDY Cosmetic products.</li>
      <li>i like it, it gives this natural glow</li>
      <li>After all, the African American girl that I am, could not possibly look healthy and glowly in this pink luminizer.</li>
      <li>this is my go to product for an instant natural glow!!</li>
      <li>I think it might look a little 13 year old wearing make up for the first time.</li>
      <li>I will say that while yes a little goes a long way, use a teeny bit more than you think you need when it comes out of the bottle or it won&#x27;t stay very long.</li>

<li> I will say that while yes a little goes a long way, use a teeny bit more than you think you need when it comes out of the bottle or it won&#x27;t stay very long.</li>
<li> Its thick in consistency, and you will really have to blend it before it looks nice, Maybe if you dilute it a little with a spritz of water it will thin it out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Hard Candy Glow is similar to Benefits High beam.</li>
<li> and it goes a long way.</li>
<li> or as everyone praised&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps because my skin is not clear</li>
<li> (I have both the Gold &amp; Pink tube)</li>
<li> It was just what I expected it was gonna be.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt; But not as I expected</li>
<li> The packaging for this item gets 3 stars, while the actual product itself doesn&#x27;t get no more than 1 star.</li>
<li> For a be dewy look... just mix  your face moisturizer with a little of the hard candy, because a little goes a long way, and add your foundation last</li>
<li> Just a slight shimmer, not &#x27;Barbie-like at all.</li>
<li> It differs in that it&#x27;s a little thicker</li>
<li> I wear it everyday over my makeup, just a touch on my forhead, cheeps and nose.</li>
<li> When it comes out of the bottle, it is SCARY pink, bubble gum pink.</li>
<li> so check out the other places before buyer here!!!</li>
<li> But as with anything, it is easier to add than to subtract so start small and experiment.</li>
<li> in all, seeing that I purchased it for only $6 at Walmart (sorry amazon,</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an all over luminizer,I like to mix a small amount of it with my foundation</li>
<li> This is the product of Hard Candy that I purchase</li>
<li> BUT THE PRICE IS OUTRAGEOUS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE VOLUME OF CREAM INCLUDED IN THE TUBE.</li>

    <li> goes on nicely and leaves a soft glow nothing too flashy just nice</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  My daughter was excited to receive this product.  Not as shimmery as we expected, but enough shimmer for a 12 yr old.</li>
    <li> Hard Candy Glow is similar to Benefits High beam. It differs in that it&#x27;s a little thicker and it is more pink. What I love is that it just takes a little and it goes a long way. Make sure to just use a tiny amount, you can always build. I say this because if you use too much, the pink will not blend into a nice glow.

This product is kind of pricey on here but it cost around 7 to 10 dollars at Wal-Mart , target. I didnt know until after I bought it already here so check out the other places before buyer here!!! But this is a amazing product you def can do alot with it and it comes with a whole lot of product so its def worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> great stuff ... original and wrapped well and had it on time&lt;br /&gt;u just won a client from saudi arabia&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll always purchase from u&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt; And the price is reasonable&lt;br /&gt; But not as I expected or as everyone praised&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps because my skin is not clear</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my customers they are loved and they are recommended to them friends also it is perfect result</li>
    <li> love it and speedy delivery</li>
    <li> I was looking for a luminizer and admittedly I got thrown off by the reviews on this. After all, the African American girl that I am, could not possibly look healthy and glowly in this pink luminizer.</li>
    <li> It makes you look like you get a lot of fresh air in the country! Just a slight shimmer, not &#x27;Barbie-like at all.</li>
    <li> i like it, it gives this natural glow and you can put it so easily. my friends liked it so very much.</li>
    <li> It is 8$ in walmart!!</li>
    <li> this is my go to product for an instant natural glow!! its pretty light irredesent pink shade flatters all skn tones!! i love it all seasons!! i have tried many illuminizers--and for this price--this is a winner!! for all my beauty junkies--try it--u have nothing2 lose and a beautiful, soft glow 2 gain!! what are u waiting for!!</li>
    <li> I got this product because I wanted to add a little more of a dewy glow to my make up once in a  while. This DEFINITELY does that! I will say that while yes a little goes a long way, use a teeny bit more than you think you need when it comes out of the bottle or it won&#x27;t stay very long. But as with anything, it is easier to add than to subtract so start small and experiment. Also, I used a small eye shadow brush to apply, and it looks really nice. When it comes out of the bottle, it is SCARY pink, bubble gum pink. While the pink fades mostly away, I&#x27;m not sure how it would look with certain other colors that bright cotton candy pink might not go with. If worn with blue eye make up I think it might look a little 13 year old wearing make up for the first time. However, I am wearing it now with a bronze and brown smokey eye and it looks lovely. I apply it in a letter C around my eye brown and top of my cheek bone. A blog I read says to also put it in the dip above your upper lip, I haven&#x27;t tried that yet but I plan to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, seeing that I purchased it for only $6 at Walmart (sorry amazon, but you&#x27;re double the price on this one...) rather than $15, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. If I had spent the $15, not sure I&#x27;d be very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I wanted the look of a glow but not a tan. This product is smooth and comforable and works well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT THE PRICE IS OUTRAGEOUS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE VOLUME OF CREAM INCLUDED IN THE TUBE. ADDITIONALLY, THE TUBE ITSELF IS NOT THE BEST OF DISPENSERS FOR THIS SORT OF PRODUCT; I SUSPECT MORE CREAM MAY BE LEFT IN THE TUBE THAN WAS EXTRACTED FROM IT.</li>
    <li> Is a good product, I liked it very much.  It was just what I expected it was gonna be. Thank you</li>
    <li> Product more wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Product beyond description&lt;br /&gt;I advise everyone Bsthaddamh Genuine First, because he was sure of it personally&lt;br /&gt;I am very wonderful wonderful performance&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the majority of HARD CANDY Cosmetic products. I was very happy when they started selling their items in WALMART, for LESS than it was being sold in SEPHORA. But this item is just \\&quot;OKAY\\&quot; for me. The packaging for this item gets 3 stars, while the actual product itself doesn&#x27;t get no more than 1 star. This item gets alot of \\&quot;KUDOS\\&quot; &amp; positive talk on YOUTUBE vids, but I have better brands of illuminator/hi lighters in my make up stash. Despite this fact, I try my best to use it every now and again (I have both the Gold &amp; Pink tube) they pretty much just take up space in my make up drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Its thick in consistency, and you will really have to blend it before it looks nice, Maybe if you dilute it a little with a spritz of water it will thin it out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The tube is a nice size tube. Its large, so you get alot of product for a great price. It is not glittery or too sparkley.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this would be too &amp;#34;frosty&amp;#34; but it gives a great glow. I wear it everyday over my makeup, just a touch on my forhead, cheeps and nose. Gives a perfect healthy glow!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t too fond of this on my skintone. Nonetheless it will lool beautiful on light skinned.</li>
    <li> I use this with other skin glowing things, but this product works amazing on all skin tones.  it is cheaper than Josie Maran Illuminizer but does the same thing, great price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve choosed it because It&#x27;s famous and I like when I apply it on my face it really gives a beautiful refliction</li>
    <li> This is the product of Hard Candy that I purchase and I&#x27;m sure I will try other things because I liked this very much.Not only you get a product so easy to use but you get a ton of it.It&#x27;s an all over luminizer,I like to mix a small amount of it with my foundation and it gives a beautiful glow to the face.Will recommend this for any makeup lover.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I would definitely recommend it for a nice glow on a special occasion.  I did find that it caused me to break out, not horribly but I&#x27;m guessing it clogs pores.  Wish it didn&#x27;t give my pimples because I loved the way it made my skin glow.</li>
