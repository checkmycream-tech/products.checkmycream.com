      <li>This keep everything clean while you work on an impressive trim.  </li>
      <li>Works great - many options - good instructions</li>
      <li>Product is very precise, versatile and has a great assortment of accessories.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased with the product and price</li>
      <li>Excellent product, the vacuum is a brilliant idea that works, and the shaver cuts close.</li>
      <li>Ingenious!</li>
      <li>Sure there&#x27;s SOME whiskers here and there, but not the field of hairs that I was dealing with before!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re going for a closer trim, but if you need to keep the trimmer spaced off your face, take great care.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, for the price, these are amazing.</li>
      <li>Just amazing in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>It captures he whiskers effectively.</li>
      <li>, I DO MY OWN HAIR.</li>
      <li>The charging indicator lights are nice.  </li>
      <li>Also has a nicely working mini shaver head attachment to get around my goatee, which I shave under my nose.</li>
      <li>While they did come with a nice storage bag, I doubt they will ever leave</li>
      <li>but it did a nice job.  </li>
      <li>The attachments are nice but would rather have them on a stand than in a bag (or both).</li>
      <li>I use it to cut my own hair, as well as keep my beard neat.</li>
      <li>It was a nice trimmer, however the battery lost the ability to recharge about 4 months after the warranty expired.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It worked fine each time and very handy without a cord.  </li>
      <li>unit is nice to hold, feels good in the hand, so ergonomically it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>unit is nice to hold, feels good in the hand, so ergonomically it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>but I have used the adjustable blade guard to do my side burns and eyebrows and that is very easy to use and adjust.</li>
      <li>in all, this is a very nice grooming tool that should last for years, and at a very fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
      <li>I guess that would be handy if you were doing more than one hair trim.</li>
      <li>The VPG6530 by far is the best at vacuuming the trimmings.</li>
      <li>I use the shorted setting on the top of my head for a nice close cut.</li>
      <li>Guess they cater to those who can&#x27;t afford better, which is actually a nice thing.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice not to have to deal with that any more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perhaps not the best for light, compact travel, but it&#x27;s perfect for my everyday home use.</li>
      <li>So, 5 stars for being the best &amp; most convenient head buzzer thus far in a cordless, lightweight trimmer.</li>
      <li>This one works pretty great.</li>
      <li>I like this trimmer, it vacuums the cuttings nicely, and it&#x27;s easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>Really nice tool, easily recommended.</li>
      <li>40 minutes at full power is still exceptional....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
      <li>The battery lasts me about two weeks of use, though I expect it to be running closer to a week after 6-12 months, like most razor batteries.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I am pleased with this trimmer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better shave than one done by a blade.  </li>
      <li>There are, however, better body groomers if you&#x27;re a man and  </li>
      <li>It seems to struggle more with the beard than the head.  </li>
      <li>I love beard type shavers.</li>
      <li>I also love the fact he no longer has fuzzy things growing out of his nose.</li>
      <li>I wish the pouch had 2 sections, one of the trimmer and power cord and another section for the many attachments.</li>
      <li>The size and noise of the unit are both greater than I imagined from the product description and pictures.</li>
      <li>The VPG6530 catches 90% or more of the hair.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to check out the Remington Products page for \\&quot;Manstyle\\</li>
      <li>It has a lot of bells and whistles but if it vacuumed better, that would make this a 5 star review.</li>
      <li>They do not irritate my skin like all foil and many circular norelco type razors.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great item and my man loves it!</li>
    <li> Not the bestm reasonable price, very loud, excellent vacuum system</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and price</li>
    <li> Worked great for two uses. One the third use, it pulled a ton of hair to begin until it started trimming again. Fourth use it didn&#x27;t pull, but literally cut maybe 10% of the hair each pass. I had to run it over the same spot 10-12 times to get all of the hair. The vacuum part works very well catching easily 95% of the hair, but it just didn&#x27;t last long enough. Also a little tough to trim sideburns with (upside down) because the part that catches the hair blocks it a little bit.</li>
    <li> Great battery life and the vacuum feature works very well. The attachments are easy to install. Does a great job manscaping.</li>
    <li> This buzzer is a replacement for my old Norelco vacuum (T980) groomer/trimmer.  While the build quality of the Remington trimmer is much better, I still long for my old broken unit (if it still functioned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington vacuum unit sucks in about 95% of the shaved beard trimmings (better than the prior unit), but what is not sucked is shot across the countertop like canon fire (the strays with the prior unit just fell nicely into the sink).  As a result, you will be cleaning the counter after every trimming - however, the amount you are cleaning is fairly small, so the task is not too difficult (just annoying)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The accessories that come with this unit are a marketing gimmick.  While they all fit well, many of the blade attachments are repetitive (why do I need two covers that shave to the same length).  Likewise, I would avoid the foil trimmer attachment at all costs - I have never had such a painful shave in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the trimmer action itself, the razor certainly grabs as it shaves (especially if you use it without a guard) - making it occasionally quite painfully.  I have never had a shaver pull like this one, until my skin got used to it, I almost returned the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this less than stellar review, why did I give it 3 stars:&lt;br /&gt; - The Remington does provide a consistent shave at any angle (despite the pulling)&lt;br /&gt; - The vacuum (which is a little noisy) does a solid job and picks up more hairs than the competitors&lt;br /&gt; - Remington offers a 60 day challenge to try the trimmer out at no cost - you can return it if you do not like it.&lt;br /&gt; - The competition in the vacuum trimmer market is no better (the new norelco&#x27;s are not as nice or as well built).</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head and keep my beard trimmed.  It seems to struggle more with the beard than the head.  Granted, my beard is thicker than the hair on my head...(which is why I&#x27;m shaving it...) but I figured it could do the beard easier.  It will cut it, I just have to go over it a few times.  And I don&#x27;t have a long beard or anything; I trim with the #1 guard 1-2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little smaller than I was expecting, but it works pretty well.  The vacuum collects most of the hair, but there is still hair to clean up.  I have to empty the hair collection thing a couple times during (again, I don&#x27;t have a whole lot on top) but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with it is that the battery doesn&#x27;t let you know it&#x27;s gonna die.  No warning lights, motor doesn&#x27;t slow down, nothing.  So you might get half way through and it just quits which is what happened to me.  The dumbest part is that you can&#x27;t use it while it is plugged in charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you keep it charged it works well.  Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> Flat out don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. The hype about the vacuum for the falling hair is a joke. I don&#x27;t know where to start.&lt;br /&gt;I have an older Remington that has worked great but its getting a bit dull and so I figured I would buy another Remington. The size of&lt;br /&gt;this is very bulky and not comfortable to use at all. It feels very awkward in your hand. The space that was needed for the trap to take&lt;br /&gt;in the hair from the &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; creates distance from the razor to your face which compounds the awkwardness of handling this product.&lt;br /&gt;It feels really rough going over your beard and it cut ok but was such an unpleasant experience that I went back to my old one til I can decide on something else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It works pretty well. It&#x27;s really noisy..and the guard/vacuum part makes it hard to see where the blade is going.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 3 months and the battery will hold a charge for only about 5 seconds even though it has been plugged in all day.  The razor won&#x27;t work while plugged in either.</li>
    <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. Fully charged, it runs for 20-30 seconds. I should have paid attention to the reviews with similar products. Waste of money!!!!</li>
    <li> This shaver is a pretty good value. It&#x27;s powerful, with an array of attachments to help groom pretty much anywhere. There are only 2 criticisms I have which cause me to give it a 4-star rating instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, precision. With it&#x27;s default shaver attachment, the vacuum above the blade makes it a bit difficult to know precisely if your edging where you need to be, and evenly. It&#x27;s not impossible if you&#x27;re careful, but it is more difficult due to the vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, speaking of the vacuum, it seems Remington is so confident in this gimmick, that as you open the box properly it greets you with a message something to effect of &amp;#34;Enjoy your clean sink&amp;#34;. Now, this is almost like it&#x27;s trolling their own product because on my first facial trim I definitely had whiskers all over and around my sink, but it was only about half as much as normal. So while the vacuum does help, you certainly won&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;clean sink&amp;#34;. A message like &amp;#34;Enjoy your %50 clean sink&amp;#34; would have been more accurate.</li>
    <li> Not enough power. If you move it too fast you will feel that it pulls your beards.... very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to Phillips Norelco</li>
    <li> A bit clunky, but works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Does not work as well as other trimmers I&#x27;ve had in the the past, but still will give it a five rating.</li>
    <li> This groomer is very versatile. All the attachments it comes with work great and the suction feature is marvelous. Helps a lot if you like to keep that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look and trim facial hair often. Less cleanup of those short hairs that get everywhere. It&#x27;s more quiet than I thought it would be. That being said, it&#x27;s still a trimmer so it&#x27;s not silent. The batter lasts a very good while. I still haven&#x27;t HAD to charge it yet. It&#x27;s bigger than the old personal groomer I had but maybe by 15% to 20%. Only thing I think should be said about this is that the foil attachment doesn&#x27;t utilize the vacuum feature so you have to clean that one out manually (unless I&#x27;m completely overlooking something). Anyway, for the price, these are amazing. Planning on giving my brother one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! It cuts great, has a bunch of handy attachments, is easy to use, and the vacuum sucks in most of the whiskers (doesn&#x27;t catch ALL the hair, but greatly reduces the mess). So happy I bought it!</li>
    <li> Received as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience on FIRST USE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned it on and it ran right out of the box (ran it for ~5 seconds), but I went ahead and charged it overnight anyways to ensure a full charge (blue light was on the entire time it was plugged in).&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I started trimming my beard and 30 seconds later it just cut off (didn&#x27;t slow down...instant off).  Turning the switch off and on it would only run for about 1-2 seconds.  Next I attempted to run it with the charging cord connected...still only ran for 2 seconds.  Walked away and came back 10 minutes later.  Again it ran for 30 seconds...I left it sitting on the counter and it quit.  Again it would run for less then 2 seconds each time the switch was turned off.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t hot but acts like an overheated or seized motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning it today!.</li>
    <li> My son got this as a gift. He likes it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many Remington products over the years, I&#x27;ve just come to trust the name. This is an excellent trimmer for hair, beards, mustaches, sideburns, my cat. And the vacuum feature makes it just that much better. If there&#x27;s one thing I hate it&#x27;s trying to get up all the teeny tiny hair snips and fuzz that end up down your neck, on the floor, in the sink, behind your ears. It&#x27;s so nice not to have to deal with that any more. This Remington has attachments for most of your needs: the full-size trimmer; the nose and ear hair trimmer (something you don&#x27;t often see on a hair trimmer, and especially good, I would imagine, with the vacuum feature); a \\&quot;foil\\&quot; shaver, which gets close to the skin; a little detail trimmer to trim in tight areas (very handy). With a lithium battery and 4-hour charge time, you can supposedly run this for an hour at full power. I guess that would be handy if you were doing more than one hair trim. I have never had the occasion to run it until it quits. It seems to stay at a good full power and great vacuum suction for the entire time I use it.</li>
    <li> Great product and is a lot quieter than my previous Phillips vacuum trimmer. It feels really solid and gives me reassurance that it won&#x27;t break like my previously mentioned fragile trimmer. Just wish the blade was a little wider, as I shave my head and it takes a little longer than I&#x27;m used too.</li>
    <li> I have a Philips Norelco QT4050 I&#x27;ve been using for about two years or so probably, that replaced an earlier model also by the same manufacturer.  So I was curious to how this stood up to that one in direct comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unboxed it, and the battery had a pretty good charge, but I let it charge for several hours anyway until the light went out, so I knew it would be starting out with a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s quite an array of trimmer heads that can be used with this, very small ones that would be good for people doing intricate styling of beards or hair, that aren&#x27;t possible with the Philips unit I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said however, this unit was a let down as far as performance goes, even with the extra pieces.  I wanted a straight trimming / vacuuming comparison since this one has the blades positioned a bit farther from the vacuum opening than the one I already had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin on the neck, so I usually don&#x27;t shave down to nothing for my face, I use my Philips trimmer to get down to the 5 oclock shadow point each morning.  So for me, the vacuum is critical, since that saves me from having to clean up all that little stubble from the sink and counter in my bathroom.  The Philips works very well, with only a few random ones flying.  This one, however, I could actually see all the hair getting shot out the front and sides, falling away while I trimmed, and not going into the vacuum.  When I was done using this one, I had about ten times as much hair on the counter than I would with the Philips Norelco unit I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s loud.  It&#x27;s louder than the Philips, but it&#x27;s not just the noise but the pitch that really makes it seem even louder than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning out the hair is another critical factor.  I love the Norelco in that it&#x27;s a flip open plastic door, and it dumps right there.  Very easy, very quick.  This one has a big cartridge that you have to pull off of the body, and then you have to open this annoying door on the inner surface of the cartridge to get at the stubble that was cut away.  The door is really a pretty flimsy piece of plastic, and it may just be that it was brand new, but needed a bit of extra forcing to pop it open.  If that didn&#x27;t loosen up some over use, I&#x27;d be concerned with the longevity of it.  But it all seemed so overdone compared to the one I&#x27;m using, that I can literally open, dump, and close with one hand.  No way to accomplish any of the steps for this one using a single hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is nice to hold, feels good in the hand, so ergonomically it&#x27;s fine.  But with the louder noise, the less effective vacuuming that left such a mess on the counter, and the real annoying way you have to empty it, this isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d purchase for myself.e to open this annoying door on the inner surface of the cartridge to get at the stubble that was cut away.

    <li> It does the work very well, the vacuum gets 95% of the hair, and it trims my beard with no effort.</li>
    <li> The #2 hair blade did not work.</li>
    <li> i made sure that it was fully charged first and then i spent some time getting familiar with it. i enjoyed spending time learning about this grooming product... reading up on it and then trying each attachment. it was kind of fun trying out each attachment. it worked well for my needs. cleanup was easy enough. i will be using it every week now. i am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have my share of many Remingtons and Wahls through the years.  They do keep getting better.  This is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is sturdy, easy to use and precise.  Attachments can be tricky, but it&#x27;s more about getting used to what it does and how it works well with your routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big appeal here is the vacuum effect. No work hairs all over the sink and floor trying to be creative.  This keep everything clean while you work on an impressive trim.  The rechargeable battery is impressive, and after a couple weeks, I purposely wanted to test the charge time. It worked fine each time and very handy without a cord.  I have it charged at all times now, but great to know I can throw it in a bag for weekend without the bulk.  A nice charging base would be nice, however.</li>
    <li> The Remington 4-in-1 Personal Groomer and Trimmer with vacuum works as described except for the nose hair trimmer attachment which I found to be less than useless. It only has a cutting implement on one side so you had better be able to be pretty specific in aligning it with hidden hairs in order for it to work. Even with multiple attempts it did not come close to doing an acceptable good in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold, doesn&#x27;t slip&lt;br /&gt;Able to detail nice clean lines&lt;br /&gt;Good size&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum works</li>
    <li> the clipper is very bad materials , and very bad quality!! its hardly cut the hair!</li>
    <li> The best thing I can say about this trimmer is that it has EXCELLENT battery life. Other than that, the design is...awkward?? The plastic adjustable height piece is useless, so you have to rely on the standard #0-#5 guards which need to be removed for close trimming. Speaking of close trimming, there is a plastic piece in front of and just below the blades (to catch the trimmings) that makes it awkward to trim around your lip area. Needs design work.</li>
    <li> I HAD AN OLDER VERSION, IT HAD A BIGGER VACUUM BIN, BUT THIS ONE I CAN USE WITHOUT THE CORD, I DO MY OWN HAIR. I REALLY THINK IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. I use it about once a week to maintain a stubble like beard. I use the shortest blade and it leaves a pretty clean and even shave with a lot less mess than my previous electric trimmer. It has not cut me or excessively pulled hair like some on the market. I don’t have a long beard, so I am not sure how the other attachments perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight, comfortable to hold and stays charged for weeks (probably since I do not use it very often). It does not seem to lose power and chargers within an hour. I have not had a time when it has run out of juice, leaving me half groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum works well, a little louder than just a regular trimmer. It catches a lot of the hair, not a 100% but that is to be expected. It still makes the sink a heck of a lot easier to clean after I am done. The trimmings are caught up in a small chamber which holds a pretty good amount, pop it out and tap it to empty. The blade and attachments due not seem to gum up with hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The electric trimmer has multiple attachments which can easily be interchanged by depressing two buttons on the side. It comes with a regular shaver, a nose hair / ear trimmer, beard shaper and two extensions to allow for different length beards and all fit neatly along with the trimmer and charger in a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges in about an hour and is extremely lightweight, presumably due to the lithium ion battery. It lights up blue while it is charging and then goes dark when complete. I&#x27;ve used it a few times on the initial charge and it is still high powered.</li>
    <li> (Update-11/01/2016) Became dull &amp; started pulling my facial hair after 4 months of 4 times a week use. The new Philips Norelco did the same, plus cut me on my neck the length of the blade! AVOID, they simple don&#x27;t last long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Original Review): After giving this 1 star for cheap materials &amp; some poorly designed aspects, I buzzed my 1/4 inch head hair growth, &amp; not 1 hair escaped the vacuum. Can&#x27;t say the same for my top of the line much better QUALITY Philips Norelco. So, 5 stars for being the best &amp; most convenient head buzzer thus far in a cordless, lightweight trimmer. NOT FOR LONG HAIR. Also has a nicely working mini shaver head attachment to get around my goatee, which I shave under my nose. For the cheap price I&#x27;ll keep it solely for those reasons. But compared to the Philips it&#x27;s a piece of junk. The Philips cost more too, &amp; you know-&amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;If/when Philips improves the suction of their trimmer, this goes in the &amp;#34;Backup&amp;#34; box. Wish Remington would get with the program &amp; offer higher end, better quality products. Guess they cater to those who can&#x27;t afford better, which is actually a nice thing.&lt;br /&gt;And the JUST RELEASED larger model for HEAD/Hair cutting is every bit as great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: The length adjustment of the clear blue attachment needs to be pressed-at the top for moving up, at the lines of the same switch just below to move down. I was palm-hitting it to go down. POOR DESIGN! { ; {)}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 10/2016-The new Philips Norelco Beard trimmer Series 7200, Vacuum trimmer with 20 built-in length settings, BT7215/49 is MUCH better than this Remington! Check it out! (Updated 1st sent.)</li>
    <li> Best beard trimmer I have ever had. Will not nick your skin even without any attachments on it. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have an older Wahl trimmer which is on its last legs (battery won&#x27;t hold a charge), and was interested in this unit as I use another Remington product (the Short Cut trimmer) for cutting my hair.  The only downside to that unit was the battery eventually dies off.  As this trimmer uses a much higher tech Lithium battery I was interested to see how it would work in the real world.  Answer- quite well.  It charges up faster and seems to run quite a while at full power.  Most impressive, seeing it also needs to power the built in vacuum at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built-in vacuum seems like a gimmick and that it would be hard to keep clean, but surprisingly it works as advertised.  It has enough pull to capture a good amount of hair (although it clogs up a bit with longer hair, so you may need to empty it often).  Cleaning is pretty easy- a few puffs of air and a swipe with a Q-tip and you are good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides?  Well the &amp;#34;4 in 1&amp;#34; accessories feel cheap-ish and are best served for emergency duties.  While they did come with a nice storage bag, I doubt they will ever leave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the high tech battery, useful vacuum and plenty of trimming power make this a good choice for the sort of hairline trimming around the neck and ears that I needed if for.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> The motor is strong, it charges fast, the vacuum feature is really convenient for keeping your counter clean...  But the adjustable guard, the part I use the most, the piece that keeps me from gouging my beard and leaving an unsightly patch, is just terrible.  It&#x27;s difficult to align properly to attach to the trimmer, uses a not-very-reliable method for setting the depth (and getting it in the exact same spot each time isn&#x27;t easy), and it&#x27;s not very well supported when being used at longer lengths.  It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re going for a closer trim, but if you need to keep the trimmer spaced off your face, take great care.  The guard flexes easily, slips out of its groves and almost led to a beard-disaster on a couple occasions.  So very close to being a really good trimmer.</li>
    <li> very good product, i do my head and face with this, works well, suction works well, i like .</li>
    <li> Remington has been a household name in our family for a long time.  Me getting yelled at by my wife for the mess around the sink is also a very known trait in our family.  Along comes this trimmer with a vacuum built in....voila....solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regularly trim my side burns and other areas around my face which tend to leave a lot of little pesky hairs in and around the sink.  While the vacuum in this unit will not get 100% of those trimmings, it will get about 90% of them....which leads to a bit less yelling and easier clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is as stated....they say 60 minutes at full power - I say about 40 minutes at full power and then more at a slower rate...  40 minutes at full power is still exceptional....we are trimming after all...not a full blown haircut here.  The vacuum is also running simultaneously...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finicky attachment system.......some reviewers are complaining about how the attachments go on.  Personally I have not found this to be an issue....once you do it a few times you will perfect it.  Reality is also that you will not be changing the attachments so often...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this is a perfect product with exceptional quality.  Vacuum, no yelling, and perfect battery life after a charge.  :)</li>
    <li> Ingenious! This personal groomer with vacuum is perfect for trimming on the go - whether you&#x27;re driving, flying, or traveling by train. Your fellow travelers will be curious, so be prepared for questions, and they always seem to appreciate the no mess factor - as do I!</li>
    <li> We compared the trimmer with recently purchased [[ASIN:B003U8K6M6 Philips Norelco QT4050 Vacuum Beard and Stubble Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;They both perform very well, both have vacuum feature. The vacuum is not perfect on both models, but Remington seemed to do a little bit better job with less stray pieces in the sink. With both models most of the clippings ended up inside the compartment.&lt;br /&gt;They both trim facial hair very well and even, both are easily adjustable. Remington seemed to be a bit quieter.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little groomer for trimming here and there, particularly ears, nose and facial stubble.  There are, however, better body groomers if you&#x27;re a man and  \\&quot;manscape.\\&quot;  I hate that word by the way.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better shave than one done by a blade.  But I wouldn&#x27;t use one on my \\&quot;boys.\\&quot;  I like the [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro]] for that chore.  As far as this Remington product goes, the only really, really nice feature is its vacuum feature that keeps hair in a removable bin, like a stick-vac has.  That, by itself, isn&#x27;t enough to warrant the forty dollar price tag.  Also, the vacuum feature is pretty loud.  I haven&#x27;t found an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; shaver that can handle all the hairy parts.  Until they do, I&#x27;ll use my blade for my face, a trimmer for ears and nose, and a special one for my boys.</li>
    <li> really like this, the vacuum is great. no little hairs everywhere</li>
    <li> Battery: This thing holds a darn good charge, 2 weeks with light usage and it&#x27;s still kicking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments: The main attachment is not as sharp as I hoped it would be and I have to remove the blue piece to actually use it to line up. My $15 Remington main attachment cuts sharper. However, the other attachments work well, easily change out and are easy to clean. The vacuum suction works pretty well (not so much sink mess) and you can just dump the hair out when it gets full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that it is a rather tad bit bulky but I am impressed with it.</li>
    <li> I have always had a vacuum beard trimmer. The VPG6530 by far is the best at vacuuming the trimmings. It rarely misses even one clipping. The Norelco beard trimmers I have had never did that, always a mess to clean up around the sink. I also like the removable clippings catcher that can be rinsed with water. Not so easy with the newer Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;As for cutting.......not so good. I let my beard go for several days before I trim it as close as I can. The VPG6530 takes at least four (4) passes before it gets (almost) everything and you have to go against the beard growth or it just goes over it and won&#x27;t cut anything. After that you have to look for stray hairs that it missed. When you&#x27;re done, the &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; is closer that it&#x27;s competitor.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer for my head, it does not trim my hair without leaving lines. I have to retrace my steps several times to get a clean shave on my head. That is precisely what I do not want to have to do. Very disappointed especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. The vacuum on it does a great job of gathering the cut hair and holding it. And its very easy to empty the hair. The trimmer blades work well and provide a good cut. I use this for trimming my beard and cutting my hair. I use the shorted setting on the top of my head for a nice close cut. I used to use the Norelco trimmers but they do not cut as well and their vacuum does not hold the cut hair well.</li>
    <li> Its a trimmer with all the now-standard attachments for every conceivable trimming need. Essentially, it works well and does more than I need... I don&#x27;t Manscape or trims odd spots - I trim my beard, my sideburns and the occasional stray nose and ear hair.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer, it vacuums the cuttings nicely, and it&#x27;s easy to handle.  I&#x27;ve only used one of the attachments so far.</li>
    <li> The size, shape, noise levels, and battery life all work very nicely with this shaver. It captures he whiskers effectively. I&#x27;ve replaced my couple year old Norelco with this shaver that was wearing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the length selector / adjustment guard isn&#x27;t as secure as my previous Norelco.  The Norelco had a little twist dial that would always stay in place.  This one does well at keeping the length from getting too short, but it easily slips to a longer length setting.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work for cutting my son&#x27;s hair but it does! I have the hair clippers with the vacuum but for some reason they discontinued it, I saw this one came with clipper guards and thought I would give it a try. It&#x27;s really extended to trimming beards but it works for hair too, be warned the clipper guards are way smaller then hair clipper guards, takes more time to cut but like I said, does the job. Love the fact that the vacuum makes it less messy</li>
    <li> Very pleasantly surprised. Product is very precise, versatile and has a great assortment of accessories.  Works great. Feels good in the hand.  Vacuum works better than any competing product I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used to have a Norelco QT4070. It was a nice trimmer, however the battery lost the ability to recharge about 4 months after the warranty expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum is more powerful on the Remington, has a bigger collection chamber, and just plain works better. The accessories switch easily, work well and are well thought out. Receives my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> This is a great grooming tool to aid me when I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and need to trim the hair line at the back</li>
    <li> fabulous when you travel or not. cannot do without!</li>
    <li> I stopped working 2 months after I bought it.  Could only return in the first 30 days, so now i am out $37 bucks.</li>
    <li> I have a plug-in Remington trimmer - and it is awesome, but this battery-powered trimmer is terrible.  The blades don&#x27;t go quickly enough to cut well.  On my unit, the battery only ever lasted about 5 minutes.  That time steadily decreased, and now the trimmer is dead - it will switch on for a few seconds and then grind to a stop.  Maybe I got a defective unit?</li>
    <li> So far this shaver has worked great. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t get all the clippings, but it helps. (It didn&#x27;t pick up anything with the smooth shaver head, but the holes are so fine, I doubt the clippings could get through). There is plenty of battery for any combination of grooming tasks I can imagine. It would probably hold up for, say 2 weeks of mustache trimming between charges.</li>
    <li> I have had a lot of different trimmers and this ones has been working great so far. I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use all the attachments yet but what I&#x27;ve used has worked great.</li>
    <li> The main thing you are probably wondering is if the vacuum feature works. Yes, it works well. While it won&#x27;t catch every hair, it will get most. The hair collects into a little front bin that is easy to detach and dump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other nice feature of this device is the large variety of attachments that easily snap on and off. Included are:&lt;br /&gt;-Full size trimmer about 30mm wide&lt;br /&gt;-Detail trimmer about 15mm wide which is good for around ears&lt;br /&gt;-Foil shaver 18mm wide&lt;br /&gt;-Nose and ear hair trimmer&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable length blade guard - I found this a bit difficult to adjust&lt;br /&gt;-4 beard and stubble blade guards with fixed length (9mm, 6mm, 3mm, 1.5mm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these attachments will pretty much cover your detailing needs on your whole body. In an emergency, you could even give yourself a full-head buzzcut and a shave although this device isn&#x27;t really suited for such large-scale tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cuts are quick and precise without irritating the skin. The noise level is a little higher than I&#x27;d like but it&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included carrying case is flimsy with no interior pockets but it does the job of containing the many parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a versatile detail groomer with an effective vacuum feature.</li>
    <li> I am one of those guys likes to frequently trim my little beard &amp; mustache. As such, I have to clean out the sink and surrounding area after wards - but i often forget to. This trimmer / groomer cleanly and nicely sucks away all the trimmings into a handy little compartment! It&#x27;s a little noisy but aren&#x27;t all trimmer? The recharging aspect seems to work well and there is a cute little blue glow when you use it. All in all, a very nice product. The attachments are very handy also!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the price for a trimmer with a built-in vacuum (currently under $40 on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t expect much out of the vacuum, but it performs phenomenally. I&#x27;m not cutting a thick beard - only stubble, side burns, rear hairline, etc. But the vacuum collects nearly 100% of the stubble. I wipe my face or neck with a white cloth, and often I cannot find a single trimming - the vacuum has sucked it all up. Just amazing in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer says for him it only sucks up 20% of the trimmings, and I can&#x27;t understand this. Maybe he has a ~really~ thick beard, maybe it&#x27;s clogged/needs to be emptied, maybe his unit is defective. My vacuum feature works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are great and versatile. I don&#x27;t have a beard, but the comb attachment with adjustable settings is great for &amp;#34;manscaping&amp;#34;, rear hairline, side burns, even trimming above the ears. If you like a short &amp;#34;military&amp;#34; hair cut, this can do everything for you - shave your head, your neck line, manscape, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other big perk is the battery life - truly impressive. One charge will last me several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the blade is a big rough (snags a little) against bare skin. If you want 1-2mm of stubble, there is no attachment that short, so you&#x27;ll need to use it directly against the skin. In this case, it snags more than most of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other minor complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little noisy&lt;br /&gt;The head on the attachments are a little small&lt;br /&gt;The unit is a little big (vacuum fan makes the unit about 30% larger than comparable Remington trimmers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I&#x27;ve tested several trimmers over the past few years (Conair iStubble, Norelco, Wahl, Braun, etc) and this one probably ties 1st place for my favorite. Solid 4.5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love beard type shavers. They do not irritate my skin like all foil and many circular norelco type razors. This one works pretty great. The vacuum feature will get overwhelmed if your stubble is too thick or if you go to fast, but if your going at a regular pace and shave every day or two, its a revelation. My gf loves it. No more do I get yelled at because I missed some hairs. When I use other trimmers I leave hairs everywhere. Not on purpose, but they going flying compared to other electric razors. With this they are drastically reduced. And seem to all fall in the same area when the vacuum does miss it. You can trim side burns and nose hair and beards with it. There is a longer attachment that seems to be for your hair on top of your head, but this razor is much to small to be used for anything more than a trim. The battery lasts me about two weeks of use, though I expect it to be running closer to a week after 6-12 months, like most razor batteries.</li>
    <li> First of all, the hair trimmer works well, although as mentioned in other reviews, the adjustment for hair length could be better implemented. Surprisingly, the vacuum feature actually sucks in about 95% of the trimmed hair, which is better than I expected. It is simple to operate and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other attachments are OK but not as good as dedicated versions. For instance, the shaver head is small and although it works well on very short stubble, if I miss a day it becomes ineffective and I resort to a razor. The nose hair trimmer also works but the blades are a bit exposed and I use it with great care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I had the larger plug in version before this and thought that the suction might be better but was not the case. It works ok but the attachments are pretty funky, thus the 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the vacuum is a brilliant idea that works, and the shaver cuts close. The battery life and charge retention seems to be good as well.</li>
    <li> Hey there... Very Good Remington VPG6530 4 in 1Trimmer. Easy to operate, easy to change heads, cuts evenly, excellent trimmer, long lasting Batt. The vacuum is NOT MESS FREE! It should be called LESS MESS! cause it doesn&#x27;t trap all the cut hair. The Foil Shaver takes a lot longer then shaving with shaving blades.-</li>
    <li> A couple years back I bought my husband the [[ASIN:B00006IV2Q Conair Beard and Mustache Trimmer]]. Yes it works great, the 3 AA batteries need replacing periodically but it throws whiskers EVERY WHERE! I growl every time I have JUST cleaned the bathroom to then find whisker bits spewed on the shelf, on the counter, stuck to the mirror, on the soap dispenser and IN MY HAIR BRUSH. YUCK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington Lithion Power has only been here a few days - but I&#x27;m already in love!  Sure there&#x27;s SOME whiskers here and there, but not the field of hairs that I was dealing with before!  I also love the fact he no longer has fuzzy things growing out of his nose. Yes, there is hope for our partners to not shed as much when grooming themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington comes with a storage pouch that is ample enough to store ALL of the many attachments, but not so large as to be cumbersome. I wish the pouch had 2 sections, one of the trimmer and power cord and another section for the many attachments. This is just a wish that would make the pouch even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lithium Ion battery allows for 60 minutes of run time after a 4 hour charge. An hour was far more time than he needed to tame his forest, but it was still running strong so I suspect it will indeed run for the stated duration. Lithiom Ion batteries are generally far superior to NiMh batteries in my experience. The self-sharpening stainless steel blades have proven themselves to be remaining very sharp so far. The Remington includes a full sized trimmer (designed for beards, it could be used on a mostly bald head...), detail trimmer, nose &amp; ear trimmer, foil shaver, an adjustable comb (9 lengths) and 4 combs (1.5 mm, 3 mm, 6 mm and 9 mm). The removable hair chamber is gently snapped off the front for easy cleaning. Be sure to check out the Remington Products page for \\&quot;Manstyle\\&quot; styling tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this 5 star trimmer. I could not find ANY negatives with this trimmer.</li>
    <li> My sideburns and hair on the back of my neck grow very fast, often outpacing the rest of my hair.  This Remington 4-in-1 vacuum trimmer really comes in handy to trim those areas before my next visit to my barber.  Included are four attachment heads: full size trimmer, detail trimmer, foil shaver, and nose &amp; ear hair trimmer; and one adjustable (9 settings) length comb, and four fixed length combs for trimming beards/stubble.  I primarily use the full size and detail trimmer for fast growing areas.  The built-in mini vacuum reduces the amount of messy trimmed hair clippings but not completely.  Still need to do a bit of clean up after shaving/trimming.  The mini hair chamber/clippings compartment is easily removable and washable.  The rechargeable lithium battery charged up in about an hour initially and took about four hours to charge after fully drained.  Battery life is more than adequate: provides almost an hour of trimming and shaving.  Comes with a convenient storage pouch to keep all the attachments together.  Overall, a useful hair/beard/mustache/nose/ear/body hair trimmer for keeping everything nicely groomed and tidy.</li>
    <li> This is an ok shaver. I have never had a vacuum shaver before so that feature was really convenient- it cuts down on the mess quite a bit. However, it still doesn&#x27;t catch quite everything. The shaver comes with a variety of attachments which is really great. The foil shaver doesn&#x27;t cut that close though and doesn&#x27;t cut all of the hairs. None of the attachments provide what I would call a close shave. I&#x27;ve owned electric razors that have shaved much closer than this. It&#x27;s not bad, but when this one gets old I&#x27;m going to buy from a different brand.</li>
    <li> My old trimmer was a Remington, and I have been using it for well over 2 years. Very happy with the brand. The blades never seem to dull and the functionality never compromises. I was very excited to try this new Remington product which includes the &#x27;Vacuum&#x27; feature. I admit, I do hate the hairy mess all over my sink after trimming the scruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, the vacuum is cool and nearly eliminates the old mess of yesteryear. I say &#x27;nearly&#x27; because I would say it only sucks up 80-90% of the trimmings and there are still a few stray hairs that manage to sneak past the vacuum. Not a bid deal, just don&#x27;t expect a 100% immaculate sink after shaving your big bushy beard. The vacuum is pretty quiet too. Louder than a regular trimmer, but it certainly won&#x27;t disturb anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself creates an impressive close shave. It&#x27;s slightly more gentle than I&#x27;m used to, but still hacks through a sizeable beard with ease. It creates no blotchy red marks on my sensitive skin. You can also safely use it for more &#x27;personal&#x27; areas of the body without fear of being hacked into a bloody pulp. The attachments are great for nose and ear trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance and cleaning is a breeze, charging is lightning fast. The trimmer still works when plugged in, so no need to panic if you suddenly need a shave and the battery is completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I think this is a great shaver at an awesome price. Other brands seem to demand a premium for cool attachments and the &#x27;vacuum&#x27; feature, but Remington keeps the price low and includes everything you need. I like that the blades are sharp and effective, but gentle enough to use on other areas of the body. A solid 5/5 stars!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well but due to size takes some getting use to. The vacuum works fairly well but I would not purchase for that reason.  The attachments are nice but would rather have them on a stand than in a bag (or both).</li>
    <li> Gr8 product. Best than all brands</li>
    <li> Some of the attachments didn&#x27;t work at all so I have requested a refund.</li>
    <li> He likes.  Did not work for ears</li>
    <li> good but not perfect.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s good and bad in every product, and this is no exception. The vacuum is a nice touch, and it actually works pretty well. I&#x27;ve had experiences with vacuums that do little more for the task of trimming than make an annoying hum. The adjustments are easy enough. The blades are crisp and clean, cut evenly. The head of the blades is kind of small. I noticed that I had to go over areas again to reduce the appearance of tracks. All in all, I&#x27;d probably make another choice.</li>
    <li> Powerful and full charge  stay  longer really longer&lt;br /&gt;To strong and 90% stay clean</li>
    <li> This works great.  The only issue is the length adjustment is a little rough.  It takes some getting used to.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer is great. There is hardly any mess left around the sink after using I am done, and it is super easy to empty the little chamber. Not to mention it gives a really close shave. At first the vacuum noise startled me, but soon after I understood that it is because of the vacuum power--it lets me know that it is working.</li>
    <li> This razor/trimmer is almost exactly what I wanted.  I bought one before this and it didn&#x27;t turn out well as it was bulky and didn&#x27;t get close enough trim for the look I go for.  This one is still a little bulky but did an amazing job on the lengh.  In fact, this actually trimmed closer than I like on the lowest setting which is really short.  I will say I was skeptical of the vacuum on the trimmer but it did a nice job.  It didn&#x27;t catch everything but I tend to believe that&#x27;s because I have curly facial hair so I have to trim from different angles and the vacuum didn&#x27;t seem to catch it all when I was trimming with the blade facing the ground.  Before this one I&#x27;d have hair all over the place on the sink and now it was like 10% of what it was.  I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping this razor.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.  It is powerful, easy to use and easy to clean.  A charge lasts a very long time.  The only problem is that on the main adjustable beard trimmer guide, it is impossible to set it for any of the lengths over 4.  The guide will not stop at any of the longer settings.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I use it to cut my own hair, as well as keep my beard neat. Great service from Amazon.  GOD Bless !!!</li>
    <li> This works well enough but not great and the vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up everything so the bathroom counter doesn&#x27;t remain as clear as I&#x27;d hoped. And the vacuum is loud, don&#x27;t try using is while your spouse is still sleeping! It has a lot of bells and whistles but if it vacuumed better, that would make this a 5 star review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Remington products.  I wanted a step up from the PG6020 and this is the only one that also comes with detail trimmer head.  I also own an older MG70 with a vacuum system, and it catches maybe 60% of the hair.  The VPG6530 catches 90% or more of the hair.  The big problem is in the usability of full-size trimmer head.  I usually use a trimmer bare without the guard/comb to outline my beard and back of my neck.  But on this model, the vacuum chute is so close to the blades that it gets in the way, and it is difficult to impossible to touch the blade to your skin.  I guess use this as my detail trimmer, and use another trimmer like the MB4040 for outlining the beard, as I did with the small PG6020.  However, the VPG6530 is so large, it&#x27;ll be bulky traveling with two trimmers.</li>
    <li> The vacuum feature does really work and it&#x27;s fairly easy to empty.  It does not catch everything, but it makes my wife happier with the reduced amount of mess I leave on the counter.  The cutting blades are excellent and the batteries provide long life and lots of power.  The charging indicator lights are nice.  My complaint is the cutting head needs to be about 50% to 100% wider.  It takes too many passes to cover anything larger than a small goatee or mustache.  I may be a bit picky, but it is something you should consider.  If you&#x27;re using it to cover larger areas, you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
    <li> Works great - many options - good instructions</li>
    <li> In short, the vacuum on this trimmer kind of works, but not well enough to make it worth the extra money.  A few details...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first concern when I received this trimmer was its bulkiness.  It is noticeably larger than other trimmers.  However, I quickly got used to the size and didn&#x27;t mind it a bit.</li>
    <li> Husband loved it, doesn&#x27;t have to worry about whiskers everywhere.</li>
    <li> It does everything plus it sucks the hair up, you can&#x27;t get any better!</li>
    <li> The trimmer did trim his facial hair, I suppose, but it didn&#x27;t go as short as he wanted. It also real irritated his face because he had to keep rubbing it over the same spot for it to actually work.</li>
    <li> I own two other trimmers like this one, one of which is only a couple of years old.  This Remington is the best of the lot.  Interestingly, it is quieter than the other two, although not quiet.  Happily, it seems to be bult for the long haul: well-built and all the attachments slip on firmly and tightly.  The several attachments themselves are plastic but not flimsy like some others.  One of the manufacturer&#x27;s selling points is the long electrical charge that has been built into the device.  When I unboxed it it sounded fully charged.  It then languished in a drawer for over a week until the other day when I started it up for the first time.  It was still charged.  I recharged it anyway for good measure.  I only wish my Surface tablet held a charge like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a very nice grooming tool that should last for years, and at a very fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have had a number of these types of trimmers and each one has claimed it had a &amp;#34;vacuum&amp;#34; but there was always a little mess left behind in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used all the attachments but I have used the adjustable blade guard to do my side burns and eyebrows and that is very easy to use and adjust. I have used the other ear/nose trimmer as well. At first I was a little concerned with the design of this trimmer as most utilize a round style cutter and this is a small flat style but it turned out to be more comfortable, closer and less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have not used all the attachments yet but those are stored away in the little bag it came with. I do like that this is rechargeable, I plugged it in when I got it and unplugged it the next morning. I&#x27;ve used it a number of times and still have plenty of battery power left so it seems to hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are needing a trimmer this is probably the best one I have used in a long time and I would recommend it. Seems to have enough attachments for whatever you need to trim, it&#x27;s convenient with it&#x27;s battery and it doesn&#x27;t leave a mess.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a month now ; overall i like it but it has some flaws. The vacuum feature is whats special about this product and it works great. It wont get everything but its still very well done. Of course the downside of having a vacuum feature is noise, it is very loud. If you need a quiet trimmer look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the actually trimming performance it was just OK. The foil shaver is very competent but the actual full size trimmer is not. I do also have to note that it pulled occasionally; more so than other trimmers i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of ergonomics, i had no problems. Sturdy and easy to hold and use. Attachments present no problems to attach or remove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my share of trimmers, but this Remington still seems unique due to the vacuum feature. The vacuum does work, but not perfectly. There&#x27;s always a decent amount of hair on the sink, but it probably sucks up 90%+ of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is very lightweight and has good battery life. The motor feels powerful enough, though not as robust as a corded Wahl. It&#x27;s been doing the job. I use it to trim my beard, and also find the nose/ear attachment to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil doesn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like it to. The guide attachment blows. It&#x27;s sometimes difficult to get it on properly, and setting it on the correct position is tricky. Overall, it feels wobbly and cheap and will most likely break sooner than later. The guide is a major letdown in what could have been a great trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (3/2015) - Well, the guide has totally disintegrated now. It&#x27;s the Achilles&#x27; heel of this groomer and now this thing is pretty useless for my needs.</li>
    <li> Overall I feel this is the best Vacuum beard trimmer I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used 6 - 10 trimmers over the past 10 years and the Vacuum ones are my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum parts are mostly removable if you need to get into a tight spot or for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not great for long hair unless you remove the vacuum pieces but EXCELLENT for beard stubble and side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My unit makes a very obnoxious churning noise when I turn it on and had it replaced by Amazon just to find the replacement did the same thing. Since the unit still works I am assuming its not faulty. I do feel the noise is coming from the beard trimmer muti-length attachment and not the motor or other moving part in the main body. I tried to LUBE the attachment where the part connects to the body but it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with this noise issue I love the trimmer. I barely have to clean the counter after a trim and EVERYONE in my house loves me for that! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this unit for someone who is sick of cleaning tiny trimmings and needs a descent muti-trimmer with other great attachments. I haven&#x27;t used one better than this.</li>
    <li> This is second one for my husband , great product -  J.Esmi</li>
    <li> so far this is great,  not really any hair all over the counter wen i trim my beard.  cant complain one bit about this.  seems to run a long time off a charge too.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this item!</li>
    <li> The vacuum feature is nice, but it blocks easy access to the trimmer. The groomer has to be held at some weird angles to get to the stubble. Very hard to use to cut concise beard outline.</li>
    <li> This is the best. Would recommend to anyone looking for something that works well.</li>
    <li> The size and noise of the unit are both greater than I imagined from the product description and pictures. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t quite catch everything, and the vacuum inlet on the front side of the trimmer makes it difficult to create an edge with the larger attachements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all those negative things said, the value you receive from this product is absolutely wonderful. I found that trimming with the vacuum feature makes clean-up a breeze, where it was once a real hassle to wipe down the vanity and dust off my chest. The assortment of attachments are perfect for just about every man&#x27;s grooming needs. The adjustable-height head provides a very even cut for a beard, and switching the various attachments is easy and quick. Emptying the vacuum catch is easy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is aimed at the overall size of the device, but that&#x27;s a caveat for having the vacuum catch - a trade off that&#x27;s more than equal. It may be worth it to keep a standard trimmer around for edging sideburns and neck lines do the large razor length it would provide. With this trimmers standard razor length, the vacuum catch gets in the way and you&#x27;re unable to track the exact edge of the razor at an angle that&#x27;s good enough to give you a clean line.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a little narrow compared to my normal old barber shop style shaver but it cuts much closer and is way better in every way that I use it. Shaving my head, trimming facial hair and using the face shaving attachment for my upper lip. It gets that PITA spot right under my nose way better then my regular face shaver too. Now when I miss a hair it really stands out and they&#x27;re easy to notice BEFORE I leave the house. The vacuum feature is just the icing on the cake. It works awesome and dumps out really easy. I actually just came back to order a second one but noticed the price went up $20 so I&#x27;ll wait until I actually need it but I&#x27;ll definitely order one again as long as it lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> Works great. Long battery life when charged. The vacuum feature is great.</li>
    <li> I started shaving my head due to a receding hairline about 15 years ago and used a dog trimmer with a small garbage can on the counter to catch the trimmings. After a few years of that, I saw an ad for a vacuum trimmer by Remington (MB400) and ordered one. It totally made the chore less of a chore and I was happy for a few years. eventually, the non-replaceable batter started failing to hold a charge and I went through a number of potential replacements that all failed to pass muster in some way. The MB70, which looks almost identical snags and cannot trim close enough to the scalp although it is aces at trimming beard and &#x27;stache..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most common issue with most replacements was that the bare trimmer (with no attachments) needs to trim extremely close to my scalp and most simply did not get close enough. I finally hit on the http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-QT4050-Stubble-Trimmer/dp/B003U8K6M6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_asin_lnk and it did a pretty good job, just not as close as I like (no more than a couple of mm left) and not nearly as strong a vacuum. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is a terrific beard trimmer, just not so much for the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This VPG6530 absolutely nailed the head-shaving angle. It cuts fast without snagging on the longer parts and catches at least 99% of the trimmings. The container that catches the trimmings couldn&#x27;t be easier to empty - just remove the head and invert over trash or toilet and tap a couple of times and it is good to go. The battery is lasting extremely well and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the beard-trimming front, I agree with other reviewers that the adjustable guide on this one is lacking in ease of use and accuracy. However, I still have the Norelco for that so I am a happy camper overall. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone wanting a nice close head trim without having to use an actual razor.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Granted it does not catch all the cut whiskers but i haven&#x27;t owned any clippers that don&#x27;t miss a few. It is easy to empty and easy to adjust the length of cut.  The battery life it&#x27;s great. I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this groomer for a little while now and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet.  It isn&#x27;t a powerhouse but gets the job done. Battery seems to last forever on a single charge as well.  Really nice tool, easily recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this primarily for the vacuum and so far it&#x27;s been excellent. I would say it catches 98-99% of the cut hairs. It comes with a great set of attachments for every kind of detail for you could want. It&#x27;s bigger than the Wahl trimmer I used to use, and lighter as well. It&#x27;s perhaps not the best for light, compact travel, but it&#x27;s perfect for my everyday home use.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son and he said that the power was excellent and that the clean-up was minimal</li>
    <li> Bought this to keep my beard/mustache in check, but the design of the attachments makes it impossible to trim all the whiskers to the same length (kinda the point, wouldn&#x27;t you say?).  Unless you don&#x27;t have a nose, you will end up with hairs that are about 1/4&amp;#34; longer under your nose as compared to the rest of your mustache &amp; beard.  Remington&#x27;s development engineers must have done all their testing on a nice flat surface with no facial features to get in the way.</li>
