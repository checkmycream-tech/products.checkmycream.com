      <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Better for the environment, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/13/2013&lt;</li>
      <li>In my eyes, this is better than eucerine.</li>
      <li>use it as many times in a day as needed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a lump of wax in a jar than a cream.  </li>
      <li>What more needs to me said.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Wonderful product I can not recommend enough.</li>
      <li>Hope you have better luck with it than I, if you try it.</li>
      <li>After years of use and patience, I have found that the BEST way to use this stuff is to keep it next to the shower.</li>
      <li>It works better than the eye drops my doctor gave me.</li>
      <li>But I really do love and recommend it for healing.</li>
      <li>most awesome product for anyone who has dry cracked skin....heels, fingers, toes, etc.  </li>
      <li>Quality is perfect, Value is unlike any other product because it lasts me for more than a year.</li>
      <li>it works great and stays so you don&#x27;t have to reapply it so much just a few times a day depending how often your hands are in water and we both clean for a living so this is perfect for us.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hands sooooo smooth.</li>
      <li>It is FANTASTIC.  </li>
      <li>And her skin is baby smooth again.</li>
      <li>It is absolutely the BEST product for promoting rapid, pain free healing for everything from chapped hands and lips to burns, cuts, scrapes, scaly elbows, dry feet</li>
      <li>Just  love this stuff it heals chapped hands very fast without the oilly feeling.</li>
      <li>I prefer buying it in the original plastic jar.</li>
      <li>Pair it with some hot water &amp; it will glide well over skin IN THE SHOWER or TUB!</li>
      <li>Their products are excellent for skin care especially the hand creams for very dry hands</li>
      <li>I have tried so many natural solutions</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try for those who&#x27;ve tried it all and haven&#x27;t found a solution.</li>
      <li>Surgeon&#x27;s Secret is an excellent product.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s right - years.  </li>
      <li>It reduces pain right away.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would be the right thing for my pre-diabetic husband.  </li>
      <li>I live in an old house so I will leave this jar on top on a shelf over the radiator &amp; it warms the wax jussst enough so that it is more easily</li>
      <li>Like another reviewer - I did not like this stuff at first.</li>
      <li>/&gt;.This is sort of tacky, and I sometimes use a popsicle stick or plastic knife, especially if I need more than a &amp;#34;smidge&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for selling this!</li>
      <li>This works great for people who constantly wash their hands and have dry cracked skin.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;ll be a little while as you get a very healthy amt in the 4 oz jar.</li>
      <li>Just rubbing your fingertips back and forth across the top of the product will warm it up enough to get enough on your hands to do the job.  </li>
      <li>When it soaks in my skin becomes a bit more pliable and doesn&#x27;t crack and isn&#x27;t as dry.  </li>
      <li>But, I am totally against using chemical filled products</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s formula is a very dense consistency of beeswax lanolin and mineral oil.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended to everyone!</li>
      <li>She said it really helped her hands when she used it.</li>
      <li>Rub into the nails and cuticles very well.</li>
      <li>No greasy hands like so many other creams or lotions.</li>
      <li>She raved about it so much that I bought some for a friend who was having similar allergy symptoms on her hands (and various places), and she said she couldn&#x27;t believe how much it helped - more than the prescription stuff she&#x27;d tried.  </li>
      <li>Awesome secret sauce mixture; visited Michigan January 2015 and my hands cracked from the dry winter air.  </li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll appreciate how fast your hands feel normal.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>My wife and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Then I put her pajamas on as normal.</li>
      <li>It puts a protective barrier on your skin and allows it to heal as well as keeping the skin very soft.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a little less than a month, and my hands have not felt or looked this good in years.</li>
      <li>When I have time &amp; use this stuff religiously; after scrubbing my feet, they are soft &amp; smooth for a long time.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully, they have not changed the basic, pure formula at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing that I have done: Leave the jar/tub of this stuff near a heat source.</li>
      <li>I have gotten this product before from QVC, but this time, the product seemed old.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s for when you want something thicker than Vaseline, but don&#x27;t want to go so far as to apply a Band-Aid.</li>
      <li>I now have a 16 year old granddaughter using it.</li>
      <li>Frequently give as a gift.</li>
      <li>My mother had a bottle of this and it fixed me up in a couple days.  </li>
      <li>I do have sensitive skin, and for me, this product didn&#x27;t do well.  </li>
      <li>at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and keeps my hands baby soft.</li>
      <li>Works very well on cuticles and dry skin on hands.  </li>
      <li>My Grandma introduced me to Surgeon&#x27;s Skin Secret a few years back, and this has become the best treatment for dry, chapped skin!  </li>
      <li>Surgeon&#x27;s Skin Secret is my favorite weapon to fight this problem.</li>
      <li>the next day you would never know how dry my feet really are.  </li>
      <li>It does feel waxy just out of the jar but a small bit is quickly absorbed into my skin.</li>
      <li>This is the clear winner... with just a couple of applications, my cracking, dry skin begins to heal.</li>
      <li>I have had to mess with Moisturizers pretty much my whole life, but on the real dry spots, I just put on some of this &amp;#34;BEESWAX&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;WALLA&amp;#34;, my dry spots are all cured!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this stuff for about 5 years now. If they were to ever stop making it - I don&#x27;t know what I would do. I have two little girls who both get eczema patches in the wintertime. For a long time I thought that a steroid cream was my only option. Then I found this. Like another reviewer - I did not like this stuff at first. It is VERY waxy and not easy to apply. But, I am totally against using chemical filled products so I stuck with this &amp; tried to make it work. After years of use and patience, I have found that the BEST way to use this stuff is to keep it next to the shower. I pull out a \\&quot;chunk\\&quot; and start working it my fingers to get it good &amp; \\&quot;melty\\&quot;. Pair it with some hot water &amp; it will glide well over skin IN THE SHOWER or TUB! Then, when I get my daughter out - I will pat her dry with the towel (not rub or else I will rub the wax off of her skin). Then I put her pajamas on as normal. When she wakes up in the morning - her eczema patches are HEALED! And her skin is baby smooth again. If she has REALLY bad, red, inflamed, itchy patches on her body then it may take 2 or 3 nights of this regimen for the patches to be completely healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I have done: Leave the jar/tub of this stuff near a heat source. I live in an old house so I will leave this jar on top on a shelf over the radiator &amp; it warms the wax jussst enough so that it is more easily spreadable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very few \\&quot;staples\\&quot; in my house (organic white tea, lemons, granola, almond milk are a few!) and this stuff is probably my ONLY health &amp; beauty staple. It&#x27;s a must have. LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**MY ONLY complaint - I hate plastics. (Read up on all of the chemicals in plastics. Esp. the ones with links to various cancers) I wish that this came in a stainless steel, thick glass, or even wooden container. Better for the environment, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/13/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started having a reaction every time I use this. I THINK it is to the mineral oil since it is a petroleum derivative. I have ceased using this product on myself. Until I can find something else, I will continue using this for my daughter&#x27;s eczema patches in the dead of winter. Nothing else compares.since it is a petroleum derivative. I have ceased using this product on myself. Until I can find something else, I will continue using this for my daughter&#x27;s eczema patches in the dead of winter. Nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Surgeon&#x27;s Skin Secret products before. Their products are excellent for skin care especially the hand creams for very dry hands</li>
    <li> Again this cream helps soften skin that tends to become dry and rough.  Not greasy.  Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> In the winter I am constantly dealing with cracked and bleeding finger tips. Surgeon&#x27;s Skin Secret is my favorite weapon to fight this problem. It does feel waxy just out of the jar but a small bit is quickly absorbed into my skin. No greasy hands like so many other creams or lotions. If you&#x27;ve ever been trapped in a bathroom with greasy hands and a slick door nob you&#x27;ll appreciate how fast your hands feel normal. When I use it for cracked fingers, it seems to speed the healing process.</li>
    <li> most awesome product for anyone who has dry cracked skin....heels, fingers, toes, etc.  I work in water all day as a bartender and this stuff is great at the end of the day to re-moisturize my cuticles and hands.  since it is only three ingredients and one of them is beeswax, it does make your hands a little slippery so I use after my work shift is over.  been using it for 10 years and hands still look great...works on dry feet and heels and knees and elbows too.  love it</li>
    <li> Best hand cream ever.  Sinks into skin unlike petroleum based products.  I haven&#x27;t had any cracks on my fingers all winter.</li>
    <li> I have used several Jamark products. I thought I was purchasing &amp;#34;beeswax moisturizing cream&amp;#34; with 25% beeswax. I already had what was sent.</li>
    <li> The consistency is similar to a ball of wax. Cannot seem to get it out of the container. Have to make numerous attempts to even get a slight amount. It is quite sticky. Not what I expected. My fingers are so cut and chapped I will keep trying to get some applied.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be the right thing for my pre-diabetic husband.  It is much too hard to even start using so I am going to ask for an authorization to send it back</li>
    <li> My mother swears by this stuff.  Due to an autoimmune issue, her hands and heels were cracked &amp; blistered, and this was the only thing that helped (other than a sticky honey-based product that she&#x27;d use overnight).  She raved about it so much that I bought some for a friend who was having similar allergy symptoms on her hands (and various places), and she said she couldn&#x27;t believe how much it helped - more than the prescription stuff she&#x27;d tried.  Definitely worth a try for those who&#x27;ve tried it all and haven&#x27;t found a solution.</li>
    <li> This stuff IS GREAT! I have had to mess with Moisturizers pretty much my whole life, but on the real dry spots, I just put on some of this &amp;#34;BEESWAX&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;WALLA&amp;#34;, my dry spots are all cured!!</li>
    <li> I bought the un scented for my daughter who has a problem with anything scented it works great and stays so you don&#x27;t have to reapply it so much just a few times a day depending how often your hands are in water and we both clean for a living so this is perfect for us.</li>
    <li> I first started using Surgeon&#x27;s Skin Secret  about 15 or 20 years ago. Thankfully, they have not changed the basic, pure formula at all. It is absolutely the BEST product for promoting rapid, pain free healing for everything from chapped hands and lips to burns, cuts, scrapes, scaly elbows, dry feet........well, you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s formula is a very dense consistency of beeswax lanolin and mineral oil.  I prefer buying it in the original plastic jar.To get it out of the jar, you sort of scrape the surface with your thumbnail and collect what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.This is sort of tacky, and I sometimes use a popsicle stick or plastic knife, especially if I need more than a &amp;#34;smidge&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makers also market SSS in plastic tubes. They have added various fragrances to the formula, which in my opinion are unpleasant smelling. The only scent that isn&#x27;t nasty is lemon, but if you put that on a sore or raw area of skin, the lemon STINGS like CRAZY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For that and the lack of an applicator, I dropped a star.  But I really do love and recommend it for healing.</li>
    <li> My Grandma introduced me to Surgeon&#x27;s Skin Secret a few years back, and this has become the best treatment for dry, chapped skin!  We love it at our house!</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product.  I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;girly-girl&amp;#34; that does mani/pedi&#x27;s so my feet are not the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; On my feet often so the bottoms are very, very, VERY DRY.  So bad that certain material sticks to my feet.  I put this stuff on my feet, cover with socks overnight, the next day you would never know how dry my feet really are.  When I have time &amp; use this stuff religiously; after scrubbing my feet, they are soft &amp; smooth for a long time.  Also gave a friend this in stick form who had a baby that had diaper rash, this worked great for her newborn.  Not &amp;#34;crazy&amp;#34; about how sticky it is, but that&#x27;s only because of the beeswax.... which is what helps it to work wonders.  In my eyes, this is better than eucerine.</li>
    <li> This product works to relieve cracking skin, extreme dryness, painful open sores; using it twice a day is all that is needed. It provides a water-proof shield/barrier while allowing the skin to heal. I am so grateful to the friend who introduced me to this product when she saw my hands covered in band-aids one day. I have told many others about it.</li>
    <li> As describer will order again</li>
    <li> This works great for people who constantly wash their hands and have dry cracked skin. I bought it for my wife who is a hair stylist and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works on my poor psorasis wracked skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stinks to high heaven, is a bit heavy but once it soaks in, it is awesome.</li>
    <li> This is handy stuff for protecting irritated skin, or for moisturizing.  It&#x27;s for when you want something thicker than Vaseline, but don&#x27;t want to go so far as to apply a Band-Aid.</li>
    <li> Used it for years, especially in the winter time.  Prevents my hands from cracking.  What more needs to me said.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find pure beeswax for skin and not candle making so i was happy to find this seller. I would buy this product again when I run out. But that&#x27;ll be a little while as you get a very healthy amt in the 4 oz jar.</li>
    <li> This cream is miraculous for cracks and dry skin eczema.  It does NOT sting if cracks are open.  It does not stain clothes or bedding like some other creams do.  It is the most wonderful, amazing cream on earth.  The lavender is a nice fragrance also.</li>
    <li> I have gotten this product before from QVC, but this time, the product seemed old.  I had a bad reaction to it, which I didn&#x27;t understand why and.  I&#x27;m not saying the product caused the bad reaction, it could have been a coincidence, but I had to see my dermatologist because I developed a rash.  I do have sensitive skin, and for me, this product didn&#x27;t do well.  Hope you have better luck with it than I, if you try it.</li>
    <li> Just  love this stuff it heals chapped hands very fast without the oilly feeling. use it as many times in a day as needed</li>
    <li> This moisturizer protects your skin from being chapped from cold weather or from over washing your hands. It puts a protective barrier on your skin and allows it to heal as well as keeping the skin very soft. It is excellent for all parts of the body. It is not just for hands........ but feet, elbows, knees, and anything that needs help healing. It is truly a marvelous product! I have used it for more than 20 years. I never am without this product. It lasts a very long time. Quality is perfect, Value is unlike any other product because it lasts me for more than a year. Highly recommended to everyone!</li>
    <li> I had a orbital fracture on my face, with surgery on my left eye. There is scar tissue and a bump in the corner of my eye. My eye kept oozing. I bought some of this. I&#x27;ve been using it on the bump, and you know what? The bump is going away! And no more oozing! Bees have a antiseptic and I know this is the reason it&#x27;s almost gone. It works better than the eye drops my doctor gave me. I am going to keep this amazing cream on hand from now on. I don&#x27;t know if you are suppose to use it on your face, but I do and love it! Thanks Amazon for selling this! It&#x27;s a miracle cream!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I apply nightly, and anytime the hands feel a little dry. Rub into the nails and cuticles very well. This helps moisturize the nails and makes them stronger. Frequently give as a gift. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> For nails and skin, this is an excellent product.  My wife and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> For years, I have been plagued by dry skin and fingertips that crack.  The only other product that I have found to keep my fingertips from cracking is Lotil, and I have tried a LOT of creams and lotions.  On a whim, I decided to try Surgeon&#x27;s Skin Secret.  It is FANTASTIC.  I have been using it for a little less than a month, and my hands have not felt or looked this good in years. That&#x27;s right - years.  Over the past two weeks my fingertips and dry cuticles have completely healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is a bit odd.  It&#x27;s more like a lump of wax in a jar than a cream.  But don&#x27;t let that put you off.  Just rubbing your fingertips back and forth across the top of the product will warm it up enough to get enough on your hands to do the job.  You don&#x27;t need much - just a thin thin coating on your hands is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had found this stuff years ago.  If your hands constantly look like they have been in a battle against nature and lost, this might be the moisturizer for you.</li>
    <li> My dentist actually recommended this to me several years ago.  I have been using it ever since.  I now have a 16 year old granddaughter using it.</li>
    <li> The Surgeon&#x27;s Secret eliminated the dryness and cracking of the skin on the palms of my hands.  Great skin product.</li>
    <li> Works very well on cuticles and dry skin on hands.  Does have somewhat of an odor, but it&#x27;s not offensive.</li>
    <li> If you let it soften in your hands then apply it&#x27;s easier to work with. Wonderful product I can not recommend enough.</li>
    <li> Surgeon&#x27;s Secret is an excellent product.  It reduces pain right away.  A friend recommended it and gave me a sample.  Once I used it, I knew I had to have my own jar.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> Awesome secret sauce mixture; visited Michigan January 2015 and my hands cracked from the dry winter air.  My mother had a bottle of this and it fixed me up in a couple days.  Bought some for the supply cabinet when I got home.</li>
    <li> unbelieveable. I have tried so many natural solutions to dry winter skin it is ridiculous. This is the clear winner... with just a couple of applications, my cracking, dry skin begins to heal. Within a week all is well. Never had this sort of relief before, and feel like i have tried them ALL. Definitely going to recommend. Also, it says unscented and it IS. The consistency is hard in the jar, but the minute it hits your skin it smoothes out. This is a thick product - does not really &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; in instantly, but will still work into your skin quickly. It is a heavier product - not a lotion. Please don&#x27;t expect it disappear instantly: this is serious stuff for serious problems! Leaves my hands sooooo smooth. love it.</li>
    <li> I heard about this on a tv show.  I was worried about the size of the container being too small but I use such a small amount each time, I think this will last at least a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to apply and keeps my hands baby soft.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. Don;t know how I did without it for years.&lt;br /&gt;It softens and is not sticky. I use it morning and night.</li>
    <li> I have used it before and it helps the cracks around my fingernails and my dry skin on my hands.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for quite a few years now.  I have very dry skin resulting in very deep cracks that constantly bleed.  I have tried all the creams on the market  and NONE have worked.  My feet crack and bleed so badly, starting at the beginning of October to the end of May, that I can&#x27;t walk.  This moisturier is great.  It  is thick so I use after my nighttime shower before bed and wear a pair if socks.  When it soaks in my skin becomes a bit more pliable and doesn&#x27;t crack and isn&#x27;t as dry.  I have also used this on my husband&#x27;s hands and feet since nothing helped his dry skin due to diabetes.&lt;br /&gt;This  is a coating to protect the skin from the elements whether it&#x27;s the cold or due to constant exposure to water.  I highly recommend this.  To the doctor who invented this stuff:  THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> Very good hand salve.  Gave to a friend who takes care of the elderly, her hands were getting very dry, red and sore due to all the hand washing, etc. She said it really helped her hands when she used it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product that works on my chapped hands.</li>
    <li> No more chapped, bleeding hands.</li>
    <li> May seem old-fashioned, but works like a charm.</li>
