### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>that was awesome</li>
      <li>It has helped me flawlessly pull off my Dante cosplay for 2 conventions now.</li>
      <li>great wig used it for Halloween!</li>
      <li>I was very happy about this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also incredibly itchy.</li>
      <li>Great product, will work perfectly for what I plan to use it for.</li>
      <li>, I can say that I am very satisfied with the order, however there are reasons for the 4-star.</li>
      <li>Very very nice wig :)</li>
      <li>I LOVE this wig !</li>
      <li>I can use it for so many things !</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s nice</li>
      <li>Shorter then I thought, but the wig is nice</li>
      <li>for the wig itself, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>So if you want a very good white wig that&#x27;s easy on your wallet, then this would probably be your best buy.</li>
      <li>It looks okay, but its shorter than in the picture, and it took like a month to arrive.</li>
      <li>and it will definitely work perfectly!</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>It was more of a silver tone.</li>
      <li>It was comfortable all day too !</li>
      <li>Plus, I even got a free netted wig cap (and that was more than a convenience, so</li>
      <li>the wigs is pretty nice</li>
      <li>but it was fine.</li>
      <li>but the inside cap is a light tanish</li>
      <li>It would be great for a short haired character</li>
      <li>But as I said,for $8 you do get what you pay for but for a quick fix wig or just something that won&#x27;t be used too heavily it&#x27;ll work great!</li>
      <li>(I myself just kinda wanted a white wig for the hell of it and free shipping is always nice)</li>
      <li>it also doesn&#x27;t fit the head exact, and requires alot of pulling and tugging to get it on right, and for my friend</li>
      <li>From certain angles you can see the net of the wig, but depending on how you prepare the wearing/if you&#x27;re good with wigs, it&#x27;s not too problematic.</li>
      <li>Came quickly, sheds quite a bit at first then it stops</li>
      <li>fun to wear on free time and its very soft and smooth&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, if you are new to wigs and don&#x27;t already wear a wig cap underneath, you&#x27;d best get one now, though other changes needed more than likely won&#x27;t be necessary for you.</li>
      <li>Another plus is that the fibers of this wing are EXTREMELY soft, and lovely to touch, the wig is tight but comfortable, and it&#x27;s fibers are easily colored with a sharpie pin.</li>
      <li>Okay, first off I did order the white version, so if you are planning on ordering this color, then this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>Trust me, those that I listed are easy fixes, and while they were enough to bring this to 4 stars, this wig is very much worth the buy.</li>
      <li>It seemed fuller in the picture then in real life</li>
      <li>, I wore it all day yesterday and it didn&#x27;t even itch much .</li>
      <li>I contacted the seller and they were nice, but only gave back haft of what I paid.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s soft , it&#x27;s pretty</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a decent wig.</li>
      <li>but not least, please don&#x27;t let that paragraph of cons lead you away from this.</li>
      <li>If you try to wear the wig, the wig cap shows right through-not enough coverage.</li>
      <li>It is a comfortable wig with or without a hairnet (which mine came with one if you were curious) and the hair is fairly soft.</li>
      <li>It fits okay on myself, but it still is a tight and harsh fit.</li>
      <li>The wig hair feels very soft.</li>
      <li>It was significantly shorter than in the pictures used as advertisement, which means I have to get a different wig, but it&#x27;s thick, doesn&#x27;t shed too much, and is white, not gray, like most &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; wigs.</li>
      <li>This wig came in alot earlier then expected, and im over all happy with it, but a few complaints..</li>
      <li>the only problem is that it does loose its hair easily</li>
      <li>For me, they aren&#x27;t very noticable when worn, but I can&#x27;t say the same for anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Item is being used in a cosplay outfit and does the job so far</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still high above her ears.</li>
      <li>the cap being on the small size but somehow it is still comfortable once you hide all your hair.</li>
      <li>I have a fairly small head and even then, it&#x27;s kind of tight on my head.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>So shipping was much faster than expected and came in...about 13 days.</li>
      <li>The pros of this wig is once you get it on, it&#x27;s not going anywhere, you can style it right and the weave cap can be disguised, along with any of your hairline or hair underneath [and wig cap] i would suggest a white or skin color wig cap under it for those with dark hair.</li>
      <li>First, it is a little bit...see through?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and not as long as in the picture (although it may be because of how I put it on my wig</li>
</ol>

<li> First, it is a little bit...see through?</li>
<li> It&#x27;s soft and not as long as in the picture (although it may be because of how I put it on my wig</li>
<li> Not as long as it shows and is tiny as anything.</li>
<li> just didnt fit me sadly</li>
<li> The wig didn&#x27;t include allot of hair, nor was it that long.</li>
<li> Also, the back of the wig is extremely sparse.</li>
<li> I ordered the white wig hoping to cosplay many characters with it, yet i was tremendously disappointed by all of the wig&#x27;s aspects.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s spiky one one half but not the other cheap and feels wrong</li>
<li> So, be careful handling this wig.</li>
<li> Order shipped faster than expected though.</li>
<li> I ordered a white, but this wig was ridiculously small like a kid&#x27;s size.</li>
<li> it came a little earlier then expected!!!</li>
<li> , i expected a down the neck to the shoulderish wig, but</li>
<li> 1/3 or less than the picture.</li>
<li> Wig was not bright white as shown in picture.  </li>
<li> for the cons of it, there are a few, and while they could just be for me, I&#x27;ll list them anyway.</li>
<li> and it does appear abit thin in the back</li>
<li> and I wasted my money.</li>
<li> Also not easy to get on.</li>
<li> and the wig cap itself is fairly small and doesn&#x27;t have the ear/sideburn tab thingy</li>
<li> instead i got a very very short wig, that is very thin, my friend is using it for her Jolteon cosplay, and due to it being so thin, you can see through the cap, and see alot of the darkness of her hair under it.</li>
<li> WAY TO SMALL people with thick hair dont buy</li>
<li> It also came in about a month late.</li>
<li> should also say that the wig cap is very small.</li>
<li> ,it does shed easily so be wary of that</li>
<li> I am so angry.</li>
<li> The quality is terrible, the wig cap is visible, and the wig cap is very small.</li>
<li> It almost made it impossible for me to wear.</li>
<li> I absolutly hate this wig</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very very nice wig :) fun to wear on free time and its very soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for cosplayers</li>
    <li> great wig used it for Halloween!</li>
    <li> The wig hair feels very soft. However, for the price of this wig, I guess it reflects the quality. While trying to brush the wig, I noticed that it sheds...a lot. So, be careful handling this wig. Also, the back of the wig is extremely sparse. If you try to wear the wig, the wig cap shows right through-not enough coverage. I had to glue in extra wig hair to cover up the wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;I should also say that the wig cap is very small. I have a fairly small head and even then, it&#x27;s kind of tight on my head.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> It seemed fuller in the picture then in real life but it was fine. It would be great for a short haired character</li>
    <li> Okay, first off I did order the white version, so if you are planning on ordering this color, then this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I can say that I am very satisfied with the order, however there are reasons for the 4-star. So shipping was much faster than expected and came in...about 13 days. I was very happy about this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the wig itself, it&#x27;s nice. I&#x27;m using it for my cosplay of Henry from FE:A and it will definitely work perfectly! It&#x27;s soft and not as long as in the picture (although it may be because of how I put it on my wig head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cons of it, there are a few, and while they could just be for me, I&#x27;ll list them anyway. First, it is a little bit...see through? From certain angles you can see the net of the wig, but depending on how you prepare the wearing/if you&#x27;re good with wigs, it&#x27;s not too problematic. However, if you are new to wigs and don&#x27;t already wear a wig cap underneath, you&#x27;d best get one now, though other changes needed more than likely won&#x27;t be necessary for you. Next, there are some spots that kinda...I guess you could say fold out within the net. For me, they aren&#x27;t very noticable when worn, but I can&#x27;t say the same for anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, please don&#x27;t let that paragraph of cons lead you away from this. Trust me, those that I listed are easy fixes, and while they were enough to bring this to 4 stars, this wig is very much worth the buy. Plus, I even got a free netted wig cap (and that was more than a convenience, so thank you seller!). So if you want a very good white wig that&#x27;s easy on your wallet, then this would probably be your best buy.</li>
    <li> Not as long as it shows and is tiny as anything. It also came in about a month late. I am so angry.</li>
    <li> This wig came in alot earlier then expected, and im over all happy with it, but a few complaints.. It came in a LOT shorter then displayed here in the picture, i expected a down the neck to the shoulderish wig, but instead i got a very very short wig, that is very thin, my friend is using it for her Jolteon cosplay, and due to it being so thin, you can see through the cap, and see alot of the darkness of her hair under it. it also doesn&#x27;t fit the head exact, and requires alot of pulling and tugging to get it on right, and for my friend it&#x27;s still high above her ears.

The pros of this wig is once you get it on, it&#x27;s not going anywhere, you can style it right and the weave cap can be disguised, along with any of your hairline or hair underneath [and wig cap] i would suggest a white or skin color wig cap under it for those with dark hair. Another plus is that the fibers of this wing are EXTREMELY soft, and lovely to touch, the wig is tight but comfortable, and it&#x27;s fibers are easily colored with a sharpie pin.</li>
    <li> Item is being used in a cosplay outfit and does the job so far</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent wig. It was significantly shorter than in the pictures used as advertisement, which means I have to get a different wig, but it&#x27;s thick, doesn&#x27;t shed too much, and is white, not gray, like most &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; wigs. I would recommend it only if you need it shorter than the advertising pictures. Be cautious when buying wigs!</li>
    <li> Wig is so short doesnt even cover the head. 1/3 or less than the picture. Do NOT buy.</li>
    <li> Wig shed everywhere. Order shipped faster than expected though.</li>
    <li> it came a little earlier then expected!!! that was awesome</li>
    <li> Came quickly, sheds quite a bit at first then it stops</li>
    <li> It looks okay, but its shorter than in the picture, and it took like a month to arrive. Also not easy to get on.</li>
    <li> It has helped me flawlessly pull off my Dante cosplay for 2 conventions now. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I ordered a white, but this wig was ridiculously small like a kid&#x27;s size.</li>
    <li> I just received the wig today and for $8 it&#x27;s nice,it does shed easily so be wary of that and the wig cap itself is fairly small and doesn&#x27;t have the ear/sideburn tab thingy so that&#x27;s another &amp;#34;slight&amp;#34; issue if you have darker hair it&#x27;ll show depending on how you style the wig and it does appear abit thin in the back but the inside cap is a light tanish so yeah. But as I said,for $8 you do get what you pay for but for a quick fix wig or just something that won&#x27;t be used too heavily it&#x27;ll work great! (I myself just kinda wanted a white wig for the hell of it and free shipping is always nice) It is a comfortable wig with or without a hairnet (which mine came with one if you were curious) and the hair is fairly soft. But again the biggest things for me is the ear tabs and the cap being on the small size but somehow it is still comfortable once you hide all your hair. Hope this helps anyone.</li>
    <li> WAY TO SMALL people with thick hair dont buy</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig ! I can use it for so many things ! It fits , it&#x27;s soft , it&#x27;s pretty , I wore it all day yesterday and it didn&#x27;t even itch much . It was comfortable all day too !</li>
    <li> the wigs is pretty nice just didnt fit me sadly</li>
    <li> I love it the only problem is that it does loose its hair easily</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s spiky one one half but not the other cheap and feels wrong</li>
    <li> Shorter then I thought, but the wig is nice</li>
    <li> I ordered the white wig hoping to cosplay many characters with it, yet i was tremendously disappointed by all of the wig&#x27;s aspects. The quality is terrible, the wig cap is visible, and the wig cap is very small. It almost made it impossible for me to wear. I absolutly hate this wig and I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Wig was not bright white as shown in picture.  It was more of a silver tone.</li>
    <li> Great product, will work perfectly for what I plan to use it for.</li>
    <li> The wig is a lot shorter then the image shows. And my wig had damages to it to were it is exposed. Also incredibly itchy. I contacted the seller and they were nice, but only gave back haft of what I paid. My advice is to shop somewhere else for a wig.</li>
    <li> The wig didn&#x27;t include allot of hair, nor was it that long. I was going to do soul evans from soul eater but this wig does not allow me to do so.</li>
