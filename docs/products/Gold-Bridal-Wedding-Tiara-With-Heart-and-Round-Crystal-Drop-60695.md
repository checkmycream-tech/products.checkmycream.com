      <li>I was completely satisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
      <li>Not high-end with real gold and diamonds by any means but still very nice.</li>
      <li>Every one thought it was real!!!!</li>
      <li>At first she loved it, but when I&#x27;d let her wear it, she&#x27;d take it off almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>This is much more durable and very pretty.</li>

      <li>I would recommend this item for anyone having a special occasion in which they wish to shine.</li>
      <li>My customers loved the tiaras,  even came back  to let me know.</li>
      <li>I wore it for my birthday &amp; felt like a real princess :)</li>
      <li>For a Sweet 16 Gala.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>This is very pretty.</li>
      <li>Its very pretty and durable.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, but the &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; that hold it on jab my head and give me a headache after an hour or two.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>So pretty!  </li>
      <li>and she loves it so much I have to beg her to take it off for naptime!  </li>
      <li>However, one gem fell off the first time I wore it.</li>
      <li>Considering lesser quality items go for much more</li>
      <li>The combs help it stay in place pretty well, too.</li>
      <li>So I bought this and a gold dress for her for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>It really made her shine on Halloween (and now every day haha).  </li>
      <li>I wore this at my wedding, and it was much prettier than the one David&#x27;s Bridal tried to sell me for $130...</li>
      <li>We used a set of tiaras to help some teenage girls understand their true value in this life.  </li>
      <li>It fits wide and large so do not expect it to fit the head of a child.  </li>
      <li>It is very pretty, but a bit too fragile for one her age I suppose.</li>
      <li>I bought it to complete a Merida costume for a party and it has become a dress up staple at our house.</li>
      <li>For some reason my 5 year old daughter loves gold.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my 5 year old niece to use with her Halloween princess costume.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t appear too fake, looked good in her hair.</li>
      <li>We purchased these beautiful crowns for much less than any bridal store in our city and much less than any other site online (except for bulk wholesalers).  </li>
      <li>As some previous reviewers noted, it IS fitted to an adult size head, but with a little gentle bending and the extra padding to cover the pokey combs, it fits her just fine.</li>
      <li>The wire is thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t bend as easily as some of the others we&#x27;ve bought in the same price range.</li>
      <li>It much nicer than the typical plastic ones that fall apart in minutes.</li>

    <li> Tiara arrived promptly and in good condition.   It fits wide and large so do not expect it to fit the head of a child.  Considering lesser quality items go for much more I feel this tiara was a bargain.</li>
    <li> Tiara is even prettier in person!  I bought it for my 3-year-old to wear with her Halloween costume.  At first she loved it, but when I&#x27;d let her wear it, she&#x27;d take it off almost immediately.  I finally realized that the wire on the combs was extremely sharp and digging into her poor little head.  A little hot glue and a fold of fabric to cover the sharp parts, and she loves it so much I have to beg her to take it off for naptime!  It really made her shine on Halloween (and now every day haha).  It seems to be very good quality... a crown for her to wear for many dress-up years to come!
