<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does the job quick and easy ... not hard to use at all</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I had an older model which worked well but could irritate the skin. The newer model still does a great job and is easy on your skin. Wonderful invention.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, it is so easy and thorough. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just a great product now I dont  have o ask others to rermove the hear.&lt;br /&gt;It takes some minutes but it is good.&lt;br /&gt;After using this it&#x27;s good to use the tool Razorba Back Hair Shaver witch you also can find on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Then your skinn gets smoth and you can&#x27;t notise any hear, only skinn.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s truley solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;- I have also notis it&#x27;s a fantastic tool tu use fpr scratching y your back :-)</li>
    <li> The head on this thing has been sharp for a couple years. It can reach anywhere w/ the telescoping body.</li>
    <li> Good battery and gets the job done</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer is a very nice product. Super long reach to get area&#x27;s you can&#x27;t reach ordinarily. Very nice blade, will cut very close and not hurt your skin. You can move this thing to any angle you want. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Did what it says it does. No problems, works great.  Easy to use and clean. Feels like I have a longer arm.</li>
    <li> For years I&#x27;ve had to shave my significant other&#x27;s back.  No more.  He is now a shaving DIYer.  He loves it, and so do I.  Ladies, this gift is the equivalent of his buying you lingerie:  buy it for him, but really for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as one of his Christmas presents. He is very hairy and his back requires regular grooming. He had been using a popular over-the-counter hair removal product but that required me to put it on...and the smell. I bought this in hopes he could groom himself without my help and without the harsh chemical smell. It worked! He loves it. He can groom himself when he wants and without my assistance. Like I stated earlier he is very hairy and he has to go over some of the same areas several times to make sure he gets it all. The different angles this adjusts to helps him to get this whole back. This doesn&#x27;t leave a rash on his back like the over-the-counter product did. It was worth the money I spent.</li>
    <li> Got the hair off my back in no time.  Also make a nice back scratcher as well.  Only have one back so don&#x27;t need to purchase another one but would if I did have another back</li>
    <li> My hair on my back is not that thick, it is in patches, and this thing took it out quick.  It is like getting a massage, a shave, and your back scratched all at the same time.  Still going on 30 days without having to charge it yet.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Had it for about a year, and didn&#x27;t really use it that much (once every few weeks). It&#x27;s failed a couple times. Wouldn&#x27;t charge, and took it apart to see the leads to the battery came loose (loose solder, too). Now it charges, but the motor is totally toast. When you open this up, you&#x27;ll see just how cheaply it&#x27;s made. There is really barely anything to it. I see there is an Ultimate version now available, so maybe they have fixed some of the flaws of this model. But I&#x27;d recommend against getting this one, unless you only want to use it a couple months.</li>
    <li> Mangroomer Sku 211-6 Professional Do-it-yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver is the best groomer I have purchased and would recommend it due to the following:  Durability, the design is well thought out for comfortable grooming and handles like a back scratcher with better results.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these three years ago and mine still works fine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several back hair shavers over the years and this one has been the best which is a big compliment considering how fond I was of the last one I had. I really like the clever design, size and simplicity. I also like the fact that it has replaceable heads because if my last one had a replaceable head I would still be using it.  I thought it gave a close shave considering it has no finishing foil.  It also charges quickly and has good battery life.  The only complaint that I have is its not for wet use but that&#x27;s an easy problem to live with. I would recommend this product to anyone with the dreaded back hair problem.  Your woman will thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service</li>
    <li> I was reluctant as to whether this product would actually work. But I read other customers reviews &amp; decided I want to give it a shot. I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;_________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use but takes some getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;- Smooth Shaving Experience. It doesn&#x27;t hurt &amp; your back will actually feel a little numb when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;- Rechargeable. I usually plug it &amp; leave to charge for about an hour before I use it.&lt;br /&gt;- Fast Result: Once you&#x27;ve passed that learning curve, getting your back shaved completely should take you about 10 minutes flat.&lt;br /&gt;- Feels nice in the hand. It has a smooth rubbery feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;- Extendable. Far reach is made easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;_________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The biggest complain I have to this product [Other reviewers experienced it too] is it does not lock in position. You hear a click sound &amp; you think it&#x27;s a pre-set position. Nope, it doesn&#x27;t hold that position. It sure is \\&quot;extendable\\&quot; but it&#x27;s NOT \\&quot;adjustable\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a little loud but I can bear that for ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Great result. Offers a very good solution to the hairy back syndrome which involves inability to take your shirt off in public, enjoying public swimming pools, or sandy beaches! Best of all, you don&#x27;t haver to beg your girlfriend or wife to shave your back! Go DIY. Go ManGroomer :-)</li>
    <li> My husband loves this thing, works very well.</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer is an awesome tool. No asking the wife to shave my back. I also use as a back scratcher so I do two things at once. Those who dont like it because it scratches your back. Well, You pobably need to toughen up a bit. It is a proven tool that I now use and  been tested in Afghanstan.</li>
    <li> Looked for years and tried everything, this is a great little device, even bought another one in case they discontinue making them.</li>
    <li> Here is the deal.  I had the original model that required you to change the batteries.  I loved it and wore it out from years of use.  So when I saw the one that was rechargeable I was super excited and ordered right away.  I have only had this unit a few months and it will not hold a charge for more than a minute leaving quite a handsome design from the grossly under-finished trimming.  So overall I love what the product can do but I am sad that it wont do it.</li>
    <li> Works very well, easy to use.</li>
    <li> This product is OK, cutting surface tends to get dull quickly after only 8 or 9 uses. Has a good reach.</li>
    <li> Got tired of asking my wife to shave my hairy back but with this baby my problems are over,first of all it really surprised me how powerful it is since it is so light.With this much power it has to die quick i thought how wrong i was,shaved my entire 230 pound body with it.Dont mean to give too much information about myself just want to share with my fellow gorillas how long one full charge will last.It just may have enough charge for another manscape havent tried it yet but in all seriousness i highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Let me preface this with: It only has a 30-day Warranty.  Yes, 30 days.  Buy a 3-year SquareTrade warranty for $7-8.  Overall, the build quality feels good.  After charging for a day to begin with, I tried it for the first time tonight.  Let me say, after having girlfriends [or very brave friends] shave me for years, this is an absolutely amazing product.  It&#x27;s a little weird to get used to at first and I had to figure out how to navigate in reverse in a mirror -- but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  Pros:  - Easy of use  - Cuts hair very easily  - Aesthetically pleasing (for a shaver)  Cons:  - 30-day warranty leads to me believe their might be build quality issues long term</li>
    <li> The Mangroomer Sku 211-6 Pro is a great answer for the man with unwanted back hair.  I have tried everything from waxing to having friends shave the hair periodically.  The Mangroomer allows you to reach those difficult areas by yourself, and after the first grooming, I am now able to maintain it through weekly grooming in just minutes.  Great invention!!!</li>
    <li> I wore this out.  what a great product.</li>
    <li> my biggest complaint about the back shaver is that you can not use it while its being charged.....who the hell allowed that restriction to pass on the final product??&lt;br /&gt;other then that, the product works really well, quiet, and it gets the job done. its recommended to switch out the blade every 6 months</li>
    <li> Had heard good things about this product, so I ordered one.  Worked like a charm the first time, but then just died.  Couldn&#x27;t get it to work again!</li>
    <li> If you have hair growing in more places than you don&#x27;t, this thing kicks @$$!&lt;br /&gt;It does the job, you can reach all areas, holds charge for long time.  Causes a little irritation first couple uses but once your skin gets used to it, no problem.</li>
    <li> Just gotta say, after years of fubbling about with trimers, shavers, razors and all other sorts of homemade contraptions, this thing ROCKS!!!! I used it the day in came in for chest, back, sides, shoulders and everywhere else!!! Great all the way around!</li>
    <li> Does a great job of trimming hair in areas that are impossible to reach, if you&#x27;re not a contortionist.</li>
    <li> this product is the most useful product for men</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the arm articulates enough and it seems if it would extend straight out, that would help. The cutter/blades did not do well at all. Lots of pulling and tugging, took several slow passes to get hair to finally cut. The device is rather loud too. Seems overpriced by about $15 in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairy dude, and my back hair is thick and I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years to keep it trimmed short of permanent hair removal (which I would totally do if it were more affordable).  The only method that would keep things relatively neat was get a friend/girlfriend to trim with haircut clippers (no guard) and then shave with a blade razor if I wanted it especially smooth.  Body trimmers I&#x27;ve tried did not work on my thick hair, creams take several painful and smelly applications, waxing made me break out and doesn&#x27;t last long enough, until I found the Mangroomer I thought I would have to spent summers with my shirt on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome, not only does it tame the wild forest that is my back, but I can use it alone which makes the process of keeping myself neatly groomed much less embarassing for me.  I love it.</li>
    <li> It is not easy to use due to its length.  I had to remove the bottom part.  Even with that it scratches the skin if you are not perfectly flat against the skin.  It takes several passes to completely cut the hair.  I will go back to using my remington.</li>
    <li> Smooth, painless, and easy shave.  I love the fact that this product is rechargeable.  Also, experience makes using this much, much easier.  Now only if the hair didn&#x27;t grow back so fast.</li>
    <li> Buy it! Trimming Sasquatch is now a one man job!</li>
    <li> Even thought I am bald and shave my head, my back and chest are covered with hair. I have used other products before and I must say that this one really works, it trims the chest hair and clears my back hair.</li>
    <li> Pulls your hair instead of cuts. Battery life on mine is horrible</li>
    <li> Basically, you get what&#x27;s advertised - a trimmer with a cutter at 90 degrees to the body, with an extensible handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does what it says, mostly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutter doesn&#x27;t cause much in the way of irritation because of the guard design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle feels a little flimsy and cheap (though not about to break or anything)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutter lacks a lot of power; my \\&quot;Wahl Professional Trimmer 8900\\&quot; is tiny but super powerful, and less expensive; the Mangroomer should have this same kind of power, given its size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutter guard, though good for reducing irritation, also misses a lot of hairs (esp. if they lay flat against the back, as many of mine do), so you have to go over the same spots several times and at several angles.  This is annoying - it should get the hairs the first time over; a better guard/comb mechanism that &#x27;scoops&#x27; up the hairs might help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle needs to be able to open up to be straight, instead of stopping at an angle; sometimes you don&#x27;t WANT an angle in the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle also needs to have a different locking mechanism; right now it just sort of clicks at several predefined points; instead, it should have a locking toggle or wing-nut-style adjustment that lets you lock it in place so that it cannot move at all, if you so desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s useful because of the handle and the angle of the cutter, and the cutter&#x27;s gentleness.  However, they need to address the issues I mention above.  I would pay $100 or more for a product that did all of the above.</li>
    <li> I love it, reaches all those hard to reach places</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy, and I think it&#x27;s held me back with girls. I used to shy away from all contact because of being so hairy. Waxing is such a pain and if you&#x27;re really hairy then it&#x27;s painful and embarrassing to have to make an appointment. Nair sucked and I always needed help applying it which is embarrassing. This thing works and gets rid of hair, it&#x27;s not painful at all and is great for anyone looking to take off back hair, chest hair or any hair for the beach. You don&#x27;t need anyone&#x27;s help (a spot check is helpful but isn&#x27;t needed after the first few times) My confidence sky rocketed after using this thing. Thank you for making this product. and i&#x27;ve got little to no fear with chicks now. It&#x27;s effin awesome.    Remember one thing though - humans are mammals - we&#x27;re supposed to have hair on our bodies. So don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re supposed to be a hairless reptile or something.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moVG2PQF28WL8U]]Wow.  This is absolutely one of the best inventions ever made.  This thing has made trimming my back hairs one of the easiest tasks of all time.  It feels quality, and it operates without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s anything I haven&#x27;t covered in the video review, please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003NCXXIS MANGROOMER Sku 211-6 Professional Do-it-yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver]]</li>
    <li> The mangroomer performs as advertised and I am pleased with the results.  It reaches the upper and lower back very well.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using this product, but was dissapointed at the first use.  First it didn&#x27;t shave close at all (maybe if you have a lot of thick hair) and secondly it wouldn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s angle.  I had to keep clipping it back to use it.  Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Slow going, will eventually need to be replaced. I&#x27;m sticking with my [[ASIN:B002MUAP2E Razorba Back Hair Shaver]] and [[ASIN:B01CTIJEIY Razorba GOAT Wide Disposable Double Razor with Aloe Moisture Strip for Back Hair Shaving and Body Shaving, 6 Count]] its fast, easy and reliable. And you don&#x27;t need to speed up the video showing it work like this product.</li>
    <li> The shaver&#x27;s head is a decent size and allows for efficient shaving.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would take care of this unsightly problem for years, honestly.  This has done it.  I haven&#x27;t had it that long, maybe just a couple of weeks.  But thus far, it has been an amazing tool.  I used to struggle with this so much, and bounced back and forth between buying the Razorba shaver handle or the Mangroomer.  I think I definitely went the right way because this is quick and it gets very close to the skin.</li>
    <li> Does what it should. Even shaved my arms and stomach AND back on one charge easy! Easy to clean, easy to use, easy to make purchase decision.</li>
    <li> If you have a hairy back and you don&#x27;t want to go to the beach or are always worried your shirt will pull up when you lift stuff over your head then buy this and use it. It rocks.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have a black forest by any means..however this product quickly made short work of my entire back.  Evidently it also cuts ass hair :).  Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  The handle is very sturdy, doesn&#x27;t bend when you use it.  I would say there is maybe a 3 minute adjustment period on using it then after that the hair starts to fall no problem.  I will definitely be purchasing from mangroomer again.</li>
    <li> This gadget works great! Use it per the directions, like you are shaving, and it works great. I could see you having to make a few passes on thick patches of skin but, unless you have industrial bear trimmers, that would be normal. Highly recommended to keep the women from grossing out over back hair.</li>
    <li> This a product does exactly what it advertises.  I can&#x27;t say anything about longevity, since I have only owned it for a month or so.  By way of minor criticism, the product is not waterproof like the other Mangroomer products, but I don&#x27;t see that as a major issue.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> That work great .  I&#x27;m happy with that product. If you need it buy it.. for real.</li>
    <li> I had the battery operated Mangroomer for a couple years and it worked well.  Then it eventually crapped out so I decided to get the chargeable version.  This one seems to have more power and it seems more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great on my back as far as closeness and getting those hard to reach spots so I don&#x27;t have to ask someone to shave it for me.  It gets close enough that I feel comfortable taking my shirt off at the beach.  I have dark hair and it covers most of my back, but it the hair is somewhat fine.  Not sure how well it works on someone with really coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work so well on my neck or shoulders so I still use my Gillette Fusion razor, which is pretty easy to do.</li>
    <li> It works  Easy, fast , convenient  way to keep the back hair mowed and trimmed  ....Good long handle  ....  HA HA</li>
    <li> Good job of getting to hard to reach areas</li>
    <li> This does the job! Hands Down.  Even in those hard to reach areas. Get it...use it...your lady friend will love you for it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at purchase but this thing really works.  The extension and angle along with the wider head really makes back grooming so much easier...no longer feel like I&#x27;m going to pop my shoulder out of place trying to reach back there with a regular hair buzzer.  It catches the hairs on first sweep and gives a close buzz.  I do get red marks on my back, but they only last for a day.  Wish I had purchased this sooner.  Update: I&#x27;m changing my review from 5 stars to 1 star, not because of the product itself but due to the business practices of mangroomer.  I accidentally threw out my mangroomer professional charging cord.  I purchased what I thought was a replacement on ebay for five bucks, however it doesn&#x27;t work with this particular model.  Apparently all the models use different power cords.  I could only find a replacement cord for the professional model on the mangroomer website, where I was appalled to find them charging $19.99 for a replacement charging cord plus $6.95 for shipping.  That&#x27;s $27 for a charging cord. I originally paid $35 shipped for the ENTIRE mangroomer professional.  I&#x27;m not made of money, and I&#x27;m certainly not paying $27 for a charging cord that prob cost 5 cents to make in china.  So I guess my mangroomer is going in the trash, along with my opinion of the company.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a solution to address this long and cumbersome task of addressing the hair on my back for years. Today the long awaited solution has been found..for this Persian man. If you are seeking a way to single handily get the hair off your back this is the tool to do it with. Hit the buy button you will be happy you did.</li>
    <li> I gave the MANGROOMER 2 stars simply for the fact that it only works 1/3 of time. I am not sure if I got a faulty unit or if that is just how it operates. I did as the instructions said, and charged it to full status before it was ever used.  But the first time I went to use it, it only lasted about 10 to 15 minutes of use. Then I would have go and charge it again. It also seems to pull hair if the hair is anything over stubble.  I thought this would make things easier, but it seems that it was more of a pain. If it was a faulty unit, then I would gladly change my review, but as of right now I have to say that this isn&#x27;t worth purchasing.  *** March 2016 Update ***  I wanted to review my review of the Mangroomer. After posting this, I was contacted directly by a rep. They wanted to send me a direct replacement since they believe my unit to be faulty. They also sent me a free Essential Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer to show their sincerity. I believe this to be a good honest act by the company.  I have bumped my rating to a 4 Star. I will then then see how the new one works and bump to a 5 Star after trying and being satisfied.</li>
    <li> It worked just as I had hoped. It is fast and simple to use. Hair came off quickly and easily. It was very easy to reach all parts of my back. A mirror is not even needed.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s cover the basics. I&#x27;m a freckled pasty white male. I have dark brown hair. I like my hairy chest. It&#x27;s like a furry nest that women love to cuddle up with. But my back hair looks like that first kid school that could grow facial hair, except it came in patchy and thin. And since my back hair is dark, in addition to being thin and patchy, it stands out as atrocious, akin to Greedo shooting first in digitally \\&quot;remastered\\&quot; A New Hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I received this today and immediately used it. It had enough of a charge out of the box to tackle my back, even after a few minutes of fumbling with the device and maneuvering it in the correct direction while watching myself in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how did it do? I think it did well. It leaves a temperate steppe where there used to exist a patchwork quilt of old-growth forest and temperate grassland. I mean, it&#x27;s peach fuzz; finer than a five o&#x27;clock shadow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re expecting something as smooth as a razor, get your lady or bro to continue using the razor, or get to a spa and get waxed, or something. But if you don&#x27;t mind the fuzz, this thing is for you.</li>
    <li> Though im not a hairy guy I decided to get this to trim whatever little back and chest hairs i have. Got it, charged it for over 24 hours. When you turn it on it sounds like battery is dead and it runs real slow and barely cuts hair. Charged it again for a whnole day. Wouldnt start till i removed blade and put it back together. It started up but again real slow and no hair cutting. I think its not batery but poor assembly. Maybe the blade pinches the mechanism too hard... This is first time i got something online and it just not working... What a dissapointment. Will be requesting return and refund asap</li>
    <li> I got one of these a couplke of years ago and I didn&#x27;t like the way it pulled the hair as it cut.  I bought one recently and loved it.  I have lots of back hair and use it about once a week.  I was very surprised at how well it works.</li>
    <li> So, while I cannot compare this to the non \\&quot;professional\\&quot; version, it works like a dream.  It is 10x (if not more) easier to trim my back with this item.  I have also used it on a couple other places of my body and it works way better than the other trimmers I had used to de-hairify those areas.  I would definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re like me (no partner to help me reach the unreachable areas).</li>
    <li> The manufacturer of this product, Marut Enterprises, LLC  only provides a 30 day warranty.    One would think, if the company believed in the quality of the product and good customer service, they would provide a longer warranty.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Can reach all down and around on back with very little effort. Don&#x27;t have to bother anyone to do it for me. Kind of embarrassing to ask someone to shave your back. Not even my daughter likes doing it and she is a RN</li>
    <li> great product.  works well.  gets the job done.  Charge last for a very long time.  If you need a mangroomer then buy this one</li>
    <li> I had the old Mangroomer and the blades on it just tore my back up!  The teeth on the old model had square edges, and if you didn&#x27;t use a VERY light touch when shaving your back it would give you a terrible case of razor rash.  I&#x27;ve had this new Professional model for about 2 months now, and I&#x27;m Happy to report that it does not have this problem at all. The blades are very smooth with slightly rounded over edges.  You can apply a little pressure in order to get a close cut without the razor rash.  Big improvement.  And the rechargeable internal battery is a nice improvement too.</li>
    <li> It actually works really well!! Was skeptical but I am very happy with it and after many months it still works great!!</li>
    <li> Good shaver it&#x27;s not as easy to use</li>
    <li> it was kinda of difficult at first but got used to it</li>
    <li> Works as intended. Had for over a year and still works exactly as it did on day one.</li>
    <li> 30 Day warranty is insulting but the product seems to work very well.  Has good durable texture and doesn&#x27;t catch my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for one of my sons and had to go and purchase another one for my other son.  They think it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I love it. I wish I would have discovered this bad boy long ago. I grow hair just about everywhere.. it&#x27;s pretty out of control if I allowed it. Not too many chicks dig a man with an obnoxiously hairy back. I use to have to tame the beast of a back forest with a standard razor. That&#x27;s just time consuming and a bit tiring as my flexibility is only average. This piece of machinery goodness is a godsend for us hairy back mf&#x27;ers. So easy to use and cuts the time to maybe a fifth or a sixth of the time it took with a razor. Trust me, you need this product. I also use it for shoulders and my chest. Not so much on the private areas unless you like the look of putting your balls through a meat grinder. Lol.. nah, it&#x27;s not that bad but you&#x27;re likely to get cut because of the frigid manner of the skin down there. Lesson learned. Anyway, I wouldn&#x27;t say definitely get this product if it wasn&#x27;t a definite purchase you needed to get.. and I&#x27;m saying definitely..</li>
    <li> OK, the whole concept is creepy and the product is a bit flimsy for the money.  But, it works.</li>
    <li> Came a little late but it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3 and it really worked. It extended and moved my back hair in no time. It&#x27;s well made and it&#x27;ll last. Rubber grip also helps and the battery life is great.</li>
    <li> Hi, This is pretty convenient to use. I like it. It has greater reach than the conventional groomers. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the original, but this particular model Mangroomer really does the trick.  There is NO pain or discomfort and is very simple to use.  I only wish that when I cut my back hair, it would stay cut!  I use this trimmer about once every week and a half.  I could use it once a week but I don&#x27;t want to speed up the growth of the hair on my back. I have a broad muscular back and am able to easily cover it with the adjustable handle. Having a hairy back has ruined my confidence but let me tell yah, after using this guy...I&#x27;ve had some wild nights with some intimidatingly sexy women and I&#x27;ll tell yah...this version of the mangroomer has boosted my confidence, lol...sounds like an enlargement commercial.</li>
    <li> I have the unfortunate ability to grow back hair like some kind of animal. :(&lt;br /&gt;This thing helps mitigate that pretty effectively.</li>
    <li> Bought it new.  Wouldn&#x27;t even turn on after charging or while plugged in.  Worthless.  Not worth returning for a replacement.  Obviously cheap construction.</li>
    <li> My back hairs are fine, easy to shave off. However this shaver is average , at best, as far as the quality of the shaving goes.. It could stand to use a slightly sharper blade that cuts with a little more force. The extension is long enough for me, and I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Slightly akward to use at first but soon you get used to it. It feels&lt;br /&gt;nice on the grip, and did not scuff or cut my back, just left a little&lt;br /&gt;red. I love my new Mangroomer!</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it would be. The device does not straighten out all the way and I found it very difficult to use. I think it would work well for a contortionist.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver. My only complaint is that I wish the head was a little wider, but it still does a good job.</li>
    <li> Mangroomer Pro- Wow, what an incredible product! For the first time in my life I was able to shave my own back and with ease. I have a very hairy back that has grown wild over the last 4 years without having assistance, and has been a constant source of embarrassment for myself. It took me about 20mins. to slash though the jungle to find my back. I found for the first time it was easier to first trim down the jungle to a manageable level before really going at it. After that, it was a breeze to remove the rest. I am a tall guy and had no problems reaching all areas. I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to buy it. I am glad that after reading some negative comments about the original that I got to by pass that one. I love that Pro is rechargeable, however, charging instructions are pretty vague. I&#x27;m trying to get answers from support. It says to do a first time charge of 24hrs which is fine, but it also claims to have a rapid recharge, but there is no way to know how long it takes or any indication when it is done charging. Support said the blue light stays on all the time while charging for safety. Also, every 6 months drain the battery completely and do another 24hr recharge. Aside from the vague charging instructions, this is with out a doubt the best product I have every bought. Freedom is literally at hand!</li>
    <li> Update on 11/13/2011:   After posting the review below, I was promptly offered a free replacement, as well as a free replacement blade, by the manufacturer.  I was quite impressed by their prompt response here and would like to publicly thank them for re-acting in such a prompt/positive manner.  On that note though, it does seem odd that it would take a publicly posted negative review to resolve the issues described -- that is because this product comes only with a 30 day warranty while other comparable products, such as Philip&#x27;s Norelco Multigroom come with a more generous 2-Year warranty (roughly the same price as the Mangroomer).  I am updating the review from 2 stars to 3 to note the prompt attention /resolution.  Original Review:  This seemed very cool at first, now that it is a few months old, and has probably only been used 5-6 times, it is about useless.  The batteries don&#x27;t hold a charge on their own if left unplugged and the build quality is defiantly not worth the $50 I paid for it.  The thing feels like it was meant to be sold at as a $10 Wal-Mart special.  Your hand will hurt from the amount of vibration created by the motor alone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been self-conscious about my back hair my whole life. Now I can take my shirt off without feeling embarrassed!  This shaver takes a little getting used to but does a decent job once you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> This item works very well. I bought it for my son and he had nothing but raves for it. It is very convenient if you don&#x27;t have some one to help you.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;m a hairy European male, Back, chest, arms, shoulder, you name it! this grooms my whole body. close shave and I do have thick hair! As vain as it may sound my confidence has gone up, and really it feels nice to feel the shirt against your back and not your body hair. A must have, I&#x27;m so over joyed with this product!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about buying this body shaver as I didn&#x27;t think it would be that good. To my surprise it does the job extremely good. The position could hold a bit better that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars but just for the hair shaving I would give it 5 stars. My days of agony trying to get those back hairs on my own belong to the past.</li>
    <li> laser treatments didn&#x27;t work.. have to weedwack instead</li>
    <li> I was SO happy and psyched when I first &#x27;discovered&#x27; (saw ad on internet) this device on the marketplace! I thought to myself, FINALLY a product that will enable ME to shave my hairy back, rather than have to beg my wife, or catch her at &#x27;the right time&#x27;.  I drove quickly to my local retailer, and picked one up.  You cannot imagine the total dissapointment and frustration I had after trying this out, only to find out that it simply does NOT work well at all.  My conventional AC powered hair clipper slices through my back hair &#x27;like butter&#x27;, but this joke of a clipper bogs down quickly (the blades are way too small!) and does not handle hairy backs at all!  It cannot shave off even a minimal amount of hair!  The product needs a SERIOUS REDESIGN.  Perhaps they need to test it on amply hairy backs (i.e. Italians, Greeks, Arabs, etc.).  I am returning it for a refund first thing tomorrow.</li>
    <li> This thing works extremely well.  It&#x27;s not going to replicate using a razor, but it&#x27;s close enough that I (and my wife) don&#x27;t really notice.  Add to that how fast it works and that you can do it yourself, and you can&#x27;t miss by buying this...  Sure it takes a little practice in order to get the angles down and using mirrors, etc. but it&#x27;s worth it trust me.  It&#x27;s also very surprising how well this does on even thick and misaligned back hair.  Get one!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product like this, then look no further. This is it. Easy and pain free grooming maintenance anywhere you need it done.</li>
    <li> This thing works great! So easy to use because it is cordless and fast. Wish I would have found this much sooner. My ex-wife probably does too:-)  No one wants to see your hairy back in the summer when you take your shirt off guys, so get one of these before you hit the beach!</li>
    <li> I just recieved the Mangroomer and tried for the first time.(after a full 24 hr charge) It worked like a dream. No nicks or cuts, no discomfort at all, and I was able to reach everywhere I needed to. I dont know if it is a huge upgrade over the non-profesional version, but I would say if you got the extra fifty and a hairy back, trade one for the other and you wont be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once and I cannot stop smiling at how good this product really is.   Firstly, I have a back so hairy that from the sky it could easily be mistaken for the amazon rainforest!To make matters worse, as I am single at the moment, my mum has been pitching in to trim my back for me every now and then. Embarassing is the first word that comes to mind.   So I decided to look around the internet for a solution and stumbled upon this product. After reading through various reviews and having watched a couple of video tutorials, I decided to order it. I chose the cheapest delivery option and was quoted 2-3 weeks for delivery. But, to my pleasant surprise, it arrived 2 weeks ahead of schedule. Good Start so far.   I opened the package, examined the product and figured out all the bits and bobs within like 2 minutes. The manual supplied is small and easy to follow as well. I charged the shaver for a few hours and used it.   Bearing in mind it was my first time, it only took me like 10 minutes to shave my entire back! The Mangroomer is really powerful and feels really smooth when shaving. The design is faultless; I had no problem shaving any part of my back and my skin felt smooth afterwards as well, which was a real bonus. Once you figure out the direction of the hair growth on your back, you just need to shave in the opposite direction and angle, and the rest is history. The extendable handle helps as well for the lower back.  Overall, the delivery service was brilliant and the product, for me, was faultless and made me genuinely happy. At least now i can go out and not worry about my hairy back being seen in the gym or at swimming pools. Thanks Mangroomer, you have certainly made a positive change in my life.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this item.  Previously I used hair removal gels every 6 weeks or so to get the hair off my back.  Messy and long and irritated my skin.  With this shaver, I can do the job in about 5-10 minutes about once every two weeks.  It takes some getting use to - you have to get a feel for it, but it does work great.</li>
    <li> My back is smooth, clear, and I feel cleaner and more hygienic. It takes about 10 minutes to get used to. It removes hair very easily. I have lots of chest and abdominal hair growth as well, and take care of  those, too. Requires about a two-weekly maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a LITTLE bit painful. Strangely, the cheaper version was less so (that one stopped working. I hope the more expensive version will give me better luck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you not want to be embarrassed when you take off your shirt? Do you want a hassle-free, much cheaper, hair removal experience in the privacy of your own bathroom? Then get it.</li>
    <li> This was a very good product.  I don&#x27;t use it often but it certainly makes things easier and has a strong motor.</li>
    <li> I bought it and have shaved my back, did a pretty good job! Although it did take some time, (trying to get a good angle in the mirror and a not missing any spots) probably because I need more practice to get a better feel for how to use it more efficiently . I would recommend it based on a one time use.</li>
    <li> Without this product I would have a full on fur coat on my back, which is not okay during beach season in SD! The man groomer allows me to get rid of all the hair in under 10 minutes and the best part is I can do it without having to without the help of others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Effective&lt;br /&gt;Charges fast&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean</li>
    <li> this product is very well Designed.&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable unit is much better than the battery operated one. this one has more power</li>
    <li> If you prefer to do it yourself and not have to rely on someone else to help trim your back hair, this product will fit the bill.    The extended arm allows easy access to any section of your back, It may take a few tries to find the right angles to do this comfortably but you should have no problem by the end of the first shave.    The cut will be smooth and close. However, you should be careful about creating ingrown hairs if you hit the back at the wrong angle. That was on the first cut, when the hair was longer, and probably will not occur on the next shave.    There was no razor burn or uncomfortable rash after the first shave.      Over all, an effective shave and a well built and sturdy product.</li>
    <li> if you are reading this review it&#x27;s because you have hair on your back and want it gone. this will work and is painless!</li>
    <li> Men need grooming and this is the right product for the right job. Blades are sharp, cut well, and last.  Jay Madhav</li>
    <li> Long arm.  Can cover the entire back.  It does not shave absolutely smooth, but works well.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s summer. Can&#x27;t be having a blanket growing on your back. Instead of struggling to stretch my arms to their limit with a crude razor in my hand, I bought this. Works like a charm and the shaver blades themselves seem sharp to cut through some decently thick body hair. But have never gotten a scratch on me from them. Awesome product totally recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome shaver, I used to use it constantly, but lately I&#x27;ve been having problems in finding the dc charger.  Will probably buy a new one unless any caring soul gives me the specifications for the dc charger.</li>
    <li> Great product! Just received this product recently and it works great! Exactly as adveritised. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a personal groomer. Also, it&#x27;s not too expensive compared to other products that are similar. And the quality is pretty good as well.  The delivery was fast and I had no issues at all.</li>
    <li> Wife is not always available to help, so this is a reall good product for my fellow wolfmen about to go to the beach.  Works good, best to have a couple of mirrors so you can check yourself and a maid or a porch to handle the mess.</li>
    <li> For the money I assumed the shaving head of this device would have been a higher quality design.  Nevertheless, it fulfills it&#x27;s promise of removing my back hair quickly and easily. Battery life is good and adjustibility is perfect.</li>
    <li> It is an electric razor, simple as that.  Charge holds long but hair grown back fast because it is just that, a razor.</li>
    <li> Works flawless.  I read a lot of reviews and there were some guys saying it was cheap and didn&#x27;t work.  I was hesitant to try it.  I took a gamble and it was the best thing I ever did.  It took 10 mins to do my whole back.  Piece of cake.  Couple of red marks while shaving went away after 5 or 10 mins.  I wish I would have found this a LONG time ago!!!</li>
    <li> Tears up your back, leaves red marks. doesn&#x27;t get shorter hairs on back. This may work for some individuals with longer body hair but it tore up my back and left quite a bit of red marks.</li>
    <li> Item works just as claimed.  Initially you need to cut the back hair from all directions to insure you get it all, once its been cut its like shaving with electric razor.  Hope battery life is long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian</li>
    <li> Awesome, costs the same as one waxing and I can use it over and over again. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and easy to operate</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice and am quite impressed.  It really works well.  I&#x27;m a big hairy brute and I can reach all the way down to the small of my back with this thing.  It might take a bit of practice because trimming your backside is not something you do often, but I spent less than 20 minutes and am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Back is now shaved.  I didn&#x27;t have to ask for help.  I didn&#x27;t have to reach in impossible ways or tape a razor to a stick.  I feel much better now.</li>
    <li> Sharp as razor, and reaches every part of my back!</li>
    <li> This works great for the first few months then the battery seems to get weak.  And don&#x27;t drop it the plastic might break.  I dropped mine and the tippy top plastic piece comes off very easily now.</li>
    <li> Product worked well.  However after 3 weeks, it no longer holds a charge.  To add insult to injury, you cannot use this item while it is plugged in, so  it is now nearly useless. I really wanted to like this item.</li>
    <li> What can I say.  It does what it needs to do...</li>
    <li> I used to get my back waxed before vacations or going to the beach, but that was pretty rare and somewhat painful. I used the Mangroomer tonight for the first time and was BLOWN AWAY by how well it worked. I really wish I had found this years ago. Seems like it had plenty of power to mow down all the hairs. It requires a little finesse to get it just right, but with more practice I&#x27;m sure it will be a snap. It&#x27;s just like using a back-scratcher. My skin is a little irritated after the first time but I expect that will go away after a few uses and the skin becomes less sensitive. This thing shaves pretty dang close. I can feel a little stubble but can&#x27;t see the hairs at all because it&#x27;s that close. I like it; SO glad I bought it. The embarrassment of back hair is no more. Ready to shed my shirt this summer. IT&#x27;S AWESOME! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> No more beauty and the beast comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the above line summarises it fully, works well and yaba daba doo.</li>
    <li> ... this is perfect.  I cannot say I have seen an enormous difference between this and the non-pro version - both do the job just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the unit for about two months and just used it for the second time for maintenance. I find it a little difficult to keep the blade flat on the surface using mirrors but if you take your time and be patient it does a real good job and gives a very close smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Product takes some getting used to.  I had no success the first time I tried and boxed it up to send it back.  But with a little bit of practice, it works as it says.  It seems a little cheaply built and loud, but since it&#x27;s not used every day, that is fine.  Now, no more begging my wife to shave my back.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the battery powered version of this product a few years ago and hated it.  This product works like a charm.  I could not be happier with my purchase.  I had let my back hair grow for a few months since I have been single and when it arrived today I could not believe the ease in which it shaved my back.  I LOVE THIS and would highly recommend to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s that time of year again, spring and summer approaching and I needed to rid myself of my man fur coat. I thought I&#x27;d try this out and it worked great. First off I&#x27;m one of those unfortunate guys that grows a real bear suit, chest and back, and this thing was just the ticket. Like everyone says it does take a little time to get used to, and by that I mean the first run through I am already very comfortable using it. For a do-it-yourself back trimmer I really don&#x27;t think it will come much easier than this. It tore through my back carpet in surprisingly little time and effort. Also I found it great for all over the body, legs, arms, chest, pretty much everywhere except around the jewels, but it wasn&#x27;t designed to do that area so no complaints there. For some people it may not get close enough but it worked for me, my chest was about a 5&#x27;oclock shadow length, my back was closer. Also the battery charge is great, lasted all through the deforestation. No nicks, cuts, or blood just had one pinch when I was clipping around my shoulder blades and accidentally tilted the clipper too much. Some people have different hair thickness and such so I&#x27;m not sure how much that factors in, but if you are like me and have a forest on your back, I think it&#x27;ll work great. Only complaint I could factor in was the instructions want you to initially charge it 18 to 24 hours before your first use, but to me that&#x27;s more a personal issue rather than a performance drawback, so my final thoughts. If you&#x27;re athlete that needs baby smooth skin this isn&#x27;t for you, let&#x27;s be realistic, it&#x27;s a trimmer, that being said it gets surprisingly close for a trimmer with such a large blade. I was suspect much like anyone would be, but it&#x27;s a wide blade, very efficient, small learning curve, works great on all areas besides back area, gets close to the skin with no irritation for me at least, re-chargeable, easy to clean, aesthetically it looks sharp, stows away easily, and relatively cheap when you see theresults. So if you don&#x27;t have a girlfriend or wife available at the moment to do the honors or if you don&#x27;t have a friend willing to, then I would say give this a shot, you might be surprised. If not, it does come with a 30-day money back guarantee. Cheers.</li>
    <li> I hate having to ask someone to shave my back, so when I saw this I was delighted. It works great, and I could reach every inch with the extended arm. I am not extremely harry, but this does a great job. Plus, it is much faster than trying to use shaving creme or a regular trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two Mangroomers recently and neither will charge after the initial charge is expended.  I have tried several different chargers with no results.  The Mangroomer company acted like I was bothering them when I called and asked about the problem and they would not sell me another charging unit.</li>
    <li> This thing is great! Works like a charm, I have rather thick back hair and this product took it right off no problems and actually feels good, sort of like a backscratcher as it removes the hair, I would highly recommend this to men with hairy backs.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Works great and removes all unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> This thing really does work well, I would reccomend it, I would also reccomend to use it a day or to before you go to a beach or pool because it sometimes can leave scratches and irratations on your back, but that is also expected.</li>
    <li> This shaver can shave nothing; I got this shaver and was really excited but after using it I felt so bad and I was going to break it because it didn&#x27;t shave any thing.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Does the job well. Very hairy man, now I&#x27;m relatively smooth and don&#x27;t look like a back hair bear</li>
    <li> Having read other mixed reviews on this shaver I was a bit sceptic about this mangroomer but decided to give it a go, since it always seems to be a problem when I ask my other half to shave my back!&lt;br /&gt;Well all I can say is AMAZING!, this inexpecive bit of kit is very easy to use and although not as close as a wet shave its pretty close to it, it has a large cutting head and extendable handle for the hard-to-reach spots and although it may take a bit of time to master the techniques to get perfect results I would hightly recommend it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product</li>
    <li> this thing works well , easy to use stays charged al long time. it just doesn&#x27;t get a close shave or id give 5 stars. removes the bulk of the hair. and you can reach your whole back</li>
    <li> My only real complaint is that the extendable arm cannot be completely straightened out. It has a very awkward angle in which to work. It does the job after getting used to the extendable arm.</li>
    <li> Wow-- I took a coupla bucks and 15 minutes to feel 1000% better about myself. Easy to handle on my own, and SUCH A SMOOTH TRIM. like I shaved. Go for it-- u&#x27;ll besotted happy</li>
    <li> It broke after one usage.  The power didn&#x27;t turn on.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second product by Mangroomer that I purchased that broke.</li>
    <li> Easy self-use for hard to reach areas.&lt;br /&gt;Works great and holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only improvement could be a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well and surprisingly shaves close.</li>
    <li> This is a good product!!  I bought an older version on this product and was overall very happy with it, but left painful red marks on my shaved areas.  This newer version is much kinder on the body and works extremely well without the discomfort.  I would recommend it to any person that is growing hair where they don&#x27;t want it, except for your privates area...!!!</li>
    <li> i like it.  wish it had option to put batteries in as i don&#x27;t keep it charged, so i always have to take it out in the morning to get it charged to  do my back later.</li>
    <li> This is so awesome machine! Not have to get my wife do shave at my back at all. There so much easier for me to use it 15 minutes. I love it.</li>
    <li> Just fine. Precisely what I meant to order. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This is a must for any men with lots of back hair! The handle extents so you can reach every part of your back!</li>
    <li> This product does the job as intended. I could not be happier the way it cleans. But leaves bruises here and there.</li>
    <li> Researched this product and hands down it does the job excellent . It removes all hair on your back very closely like a blade with little effort. Well worth the money .</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut your back up like other back shavers. Good quality. Kind of noisy though. Something they should work on.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for over a year. I use it about every six weeks or so. I was very excited to receive the product. I had read the various reviews and felt like my expectations would be met. The product does work. However, if your are expecting a razor like shave you will be disappointed. It cuts the hair almost down to nothing but there will be some very fine hair remaining. No big deal for me it is barely noticable. The product does take a little time to get comfortable with. Best, if you can get two big mirrors side by side and go to work. My set up is more of the problem then the product. The product does slightly pull my hair and I have to pass through the same area a few times. I have experienced slight skin irriatation. I don&#x27;t reccommend the product for your private areas. Overall, I am very satisfied with my mangroomer. It removes my body hair as advertised. It does have some short comings as I have stated. Overall, I think you will be happy with the product. I had a slight problem with the product about a month ago and I must say the customer service department was fantastic. They exceeded my expectations and stand behind their product! What are you waiting for go get yourself one of these.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband and he LOVES IT !! We tried several other back groomers, but they were not even in the same category of \\&quot;professional\\&quot; line as this one.  It works great and I am very happy my husband has retired the old outdated &#x27;shaver&#x27; for 21st century grooming tools! We highly recommend this product! CJ</li>
    <li> This product&#x27;s flaws are manifold, but the most glaring are the following: While the length is ideal for shaving the hard-to-reach places of the middle and upper back, it fails to remain extended when being pressed against the skin on the back. Thus, you will fold the device into a &#x27;V&#x27; posture to guide it against your back hairs, only to find it unfolds on itself and assumes its original, straight position again. Worse, the blades themselves do not shave the hair per se (like foil shavers), but merely trim the hairs very short. This renders them incapable of removing the hairs when they are relatively short, and one must wait until the regrowth is noticeable (by which time you&#x27;ll likely returned the groomer, or disposed of it like I did). Third, but this is crucial, it runs out of power quickly and the blue charging light doesn&#x27;t seem to ever shut off, even when it&#x27;s fully charged, adding uncertainty and confusion about battery part to the mix. A terrible product to be avoided at all costs. It seems there will never be a good electric back shaver for the hairy man. Le sigh.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the 26th of August 2011. This product did not work after i used it a couple of times a week for 6 weeks. It no longer charges or works at all anymore and i cant return because i had it over a month. I am not happy at all with this product.</li>
    <li> You cant shave your own back. If you can you wouldn&#x27;t be looking at this. Get this and just shave your damn back. Quit pussy footing around and get this and shave you back. Shave it. do it. Shave your back.  You have a hairy back and it need to be shaved. quit thinking. get the man groomer and shave your own back. I&#x27;m a furry bastard ok, I get it. I&#x27;m now clean as a baby ass because I shaved my back by myself with the Mangroomer.  You have no other option. Either suffer the indignity of asking or paying someone to do this or just man up, grow some balls, (shave them if you need to too) and shave your own back. Thats what this is for, and it&#x27;s what you need.  PS. don&#x27;t bitch out either and just get the pro version.</li>
    <li> Very nice, well made, pleased! you will like this one! sleek fold up, good looking unit. other products are junky and not well made like this one.</li>
    <li> The rechargeable batteries made this the perfect choice.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, very easy to use and to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Great deal :)</li>
    <li> The overall design is very good, holds a very good charge on the battery.  However, the blade doesn&#x27;t cut well at all and you have to go over spots numerous time to get it to work.  I had really good luck with the Remington BHT600 and the vertical attachment, I wanted to try out the Mangroomer when my Remington broke but I&#x27;m now regretting my decision.  This would be a great product if they could fix the blade issue.</li>
    <li> This was a bad but 1st of the led charging light dose not work. Then you have to hit it to make it turn on. I should not have thrown the package away or I would have returned it. This is 2nd one I have had no luck with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but the trimming head is doing it&#x27;s job and well. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product as my wife gets tired of using a pair of clippers to trim/shave my back every 2 weeks.  The good is that it reaches all angles of your back without dislocating your shoulder.  The bad is everything else:  the groomer does NOT trim the hair very short.  You are left with a \\&quot;5 o&#x27; clock shadow\\&quot; over your back in which the hair grows right back and you need to trim frequently.  Even worse, the head is flimsy.  Mine broke after 3 months of use.  I am not replacing as I was not happy with the product.  Back to clippers for me.</li>
    <li> The original version pulled hair and left scratches all over my back.  This one is MUCH better.  Doesn&#x27;t pull hair at all and gets the job done. (I&#x27;m deployed and this is my only option)  The extendable arm and recharchable battery are great additions.</li>
    <li> if you have back hair you need this its easy to use easy and easy to clean. i don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to find this and buy it.</li>
    <li> Really a nice product - allows you to reach all areas of your back without effort.  The cutter design is great - clips close without cutting or scratching you.</li>
    <li> After using the Mangroomer twice it no longer cut my hair and only pulls it out. I cleaned it throughly and lube it up with no results. I have had a mangroomer before and it was great, maybe this one is just bad.</li>
    <li> bought it. used it. love it. seriously awesome .totally worth the price. its really easy to use and clean up all that unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase. Bought the first battery powered version. Finally burned out the first rechargable pro version after a few years.  Works perfect for me. Cuts my copious italian body hair to the perfect length without looking like a shaved or lasered pretty boy. At the risk of being &amp;#34;Captain Obvious&amp;#34; the first go around will take awhile. It becomes a piece of cake if you stay on top of it. Because I don&#x27;t take it to the skin, the follow ups are infrequent, fast and easy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this product. I also can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to buy something like this. I used to either bug my wife or try to be a contortionist to mow my back hair. I am 6&#x27; 6&amp;#34; and I can easily reach my entire back. I noticed other reviews that said the unit is very loud. I don&#x27;t know if I just got lucky but mine isn&#x27;t noticeably louder than a typical electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think back hair is disgusting. This ingenious razor lets you get beach ready in no time.</li>
    <li> I had the AA battery powered version previously and had great results with it until I dropped it on the floor one day. So I figured the rechargeable version can only be better. Well, it cuts better because it&#x27;s new, but the charge barely lasts five minutes after a 24 hour charge. And forget about using it if you haven&#x27;t charged it in a few weeks, you get about 2 seconds of use before it is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: the manufacturer promptly reached out to me via Amazon regarding my issue. I forwarded some purchase info and pictures to them and now they are promptly shipping a replacement and a couple extra items. Definitely some big marks for customer service!</li>
    <li> This product worked well right out of the box, but after less than a year of use it no longer trims. Right now I believe the cutting blades have seperated so it just pulls hair instead of actually cutting it. The concept is good, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My son is on his second one of these as he left the first one behind.  It does a good job, is comfortable and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I tried to lube the blades, but the device literally only pulls the hair versus cut it. I wish I still had the packaging so I could return it.</li>
    <li> Its a great product I&#x27;m a very hairy guy that uses it for shaving before bodybuilding contests and it works awesome</li>
    <li> I had the cheaper version of this product and used it for a couple of years before it died. It worked pretty good. I recently bought the professional version. I like this model much better. It cuts the hair  a lot more smoothly and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair while cutting.</li>
    <li> reaches all areas needed, don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting your back with a open blade razor, and keeps a good charge for months at a time</li>
    <li> The man groomer makes it quick n easy. No need to ask for help. Just make sure the hair isn&#x27;t to long otherwise it will take longer than anticipated.</li>
    <li> I got the item Im not happy with it at all it doesnt really do its job so yes to me it was a waste of money</li>
    <li> The charge finishes before I am even done using it!! It only lasts about 5 mins! Total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: The manufacturer did send me a replacement and it works well!</li>
    <li> Great device.  It does take some maneuvering and patience but this thing will do the job.  Take your freedom back!</li>
    <li> Guys, just buy it. Does a great job and I had no problem reaching any spot</li>
    <li> I have had a few shavers but never one that works as good as this one. Makes reahing those hard back spots a lot easier!!</li>
    <li> I laughed when I found this device allowing those of us with hairy backs a chance to clean things up.  I purchased the professional version because of comments I read indicating the earlier model wasn&#x27;t as smooth.  Seems well built, has a built in rechargeable battery and very easy to use.  Comfortable cutting edge, a bit noisy (not bad) and the angles allow you to get all the parts you need.</li>
    <li> i liked the product and it met my expectation and i am recommending it to my friends and family and thank you</li>
    <li> Took a little time to get used to. The key is to press a little harder then normal and it will cut great. The reach is good. Now I can shave myself since I live alone</li>
    <li> It trims the unwanted hair in the back while rubbing it. It is not a shaver, but has a very short cut. Unfortunately, the battery doesn&#x27;t last for long (my case?)</li>
    <li> This thing has literally changed my life.  I&#x27;m a pretty confident guy, but I know that hairy dudes really gross some people out.  Out of courtesy, I generally either avoided swimming and the beach, or I ended up wearing some t-shirt the whole time, which just makes you look like a dork.  This thing is great - super easy to use, especially once you&#x27;ve trimmed up to what you want, and are just trimming for &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;.  Now I can actually run around on the beach shirtless and get a tan, after a lifetime of covering up.</li>
    <li> Bought this almost a year ago and the product is still in excellent working-order. The charge lasts a long time and the shaver does what it is supposed to do. Very flexible..easy to hold...easy to operate. No more razors!! Product also works well for the little hairs on the back of the neck..which are reveled after a hair-cut. Would def. buy again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Best investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Husband able to shave back with out my assistance!!!  Wish I bought this for him sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use! Must buy for man with back hair!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to wax my back, based on cost/pain/embarrassment. Even if I wanted to apply Nair or anything, how could I reach? My ex-wife used to begrudgingly shave my back twice a  Summer which wasn&#x27;t enough. Now divorced and single there isn&#x27;t even that option. Thank God for this! Maybe now I will be able to get and keep a second wife.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, stays charged a long time, gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great product delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Went over my order history and noticed I bought this in 2010....AND I&#x27;m still using it today (2015)...works great and so far it still works fine...highly recommended....</li>
    <li> I bought a Mangroomer and thought it was GREAT!  Too bad it only worked twice before it died.  What a disappointment...especially for something that made what is normally a daunting task simple.  But, on the bright side, it died 17 days after the warranty expired!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I contacted Mangroomer directly.  Not only did they replace the Mangroomer (no need to return the old unit, and hassles whatsoever), they sent an ear/nose hair trimmer for free...just to be sure that their customer service was well perceived.  The new Mangroomer has worked well thus far (as does the ear/nose trimmer).  This is a quality company.  Thanks Mangroomer!!!</li>
    <li> This product was as described. Thank you very much for the product. Works like it was intended too. Very nice</li>
    <li> My package did not come with the blade guard, and the groomer looks like it has been used before. I can see marks on the side of it, and the instructions sheet has obviously been opened up and read before. It seems that my purchase was once a returned item, that they are now selling as new.</li>
    <li> This tool is a must for any man who has hairy back syndrome as do I.&lt;br /&gt;My co workers used to say as I came out of the showers at work that I reminded them of &amp;#34;gorillas in the mist&amp;#34; which is funny but no longer.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleasnatly surprised at how well made and durable the ManGroomer feels to use.&lt;br /&gt;A great purchase I would recomend to anybody.</li>
    <li> All and all this is a good shaver. Not a real close shave however for a man who has to do this chore by himself, this is the best tool I have found. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works great and it&#x27;s all you need</li>
    <li> does a great job shaving, like as close as a razor, but one charge is good for one use and it wont come on while it is charging so plug it in the day before you want to actually use it or you wont be able to</li>
    <li> I like the shaver, seems to have good battery life so far. design does make it relatively easy to reach all parts of my back.&lt;br /&gt;good price, 7 days ship time to west central MN.</li>
    <li> I just bought my second man groomer. It works very well. I can trim my back with ease. It looks like my back is shaved afterwards. My 1st one was about 4 years old. It stopped taking a charge. I feel I got my money out of it the past 4 years.</li>
    <li> I used this product 3 times over the course of 3 months, and the product worked perfectly.  But now every time I use it, the blade tugs and pulls on the hairs and constantly cuts me.  I maintained it just like it told me to, but it tugs and pulls now and is unusable.  The return window passed after one month.  It&#x27;s a great product initially, but it is hardly durable.  I am extremely disappointed and will be looking for an alternative, I strongly suggest you do the same.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;mangroomer&amp;#34; was designed to help self conscious men who want to avoid help from others while shaving their backs. By providing them with an easy-to-use razor that extends all over their entire back, one can avoid the help of others, this sounds like a great product, Right?This is completely wrong.  Please read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mangroomer&#x27;s flaw is that shaving one&#x27;s back, even with its arm extender, may still be a bit difficult, and the &amp;#34;mangroomer&amp;#34; has to be done is a straight up and down movement to avoid razor cuts.  Extending your arms over your head and then reaching to your lower or middle back can be strenuous on your arms and cause you to angle the shaver.The shaver is very strong--too strong-- that when one might be slightly off from grooming their back,  they can easily cut themselves due to its sharp blazes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that the mangroomer should have been made to be able to shave ones back on an angle that does not have to reach behind the head. Why not come from the side of the stomach?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product can hurt you if done incorrectly, is not cheap and you might as well go max yourself for the trouble it still offers.</li>
    <li> This is great for self hair removal of the back hair.  I used to have the wife shave my back in the shower but now i can do it all by myself which makes her happier.</li>
    <li> No more hair in my back. The device reaches far and is built very strong, not a mickey mouse gadget. I have used it to eliminate the hair from those unreachable places in the back. Now I don&#x27;t need to ask for favors.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a number of years. It does exactly what is advertised and keeps my back smooth at all times. I even take it with me when I travel.  I had an issue with it recently and customer service replied faster that promptly and remedied the situation immediately. If only all companies would treat their loyal customers the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Does a great job of getting rid of that unwanted back hair.  Watch the videos.  Sure you might have to pass over a area a second time depending on hair thickness but it is exceptionally sharp and does the trick.  It charges quickly and I&#x60;ve never ran down the battery while using it.  Folds up nicely and doesn&#x60;t take up much space.  All you need is a mirror to help you out and you&#x60;re good to go.</li>
    <li> First time out of the box I found it lacks cutting power and it takes many times to get a decent shave. One is better off to by a trimmer and have someone do it for them.</li>
    <li> This is great, just what I needed. I know I sound like a fake review but this thing is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s saved me money. I used to get wax treatments to get the back hair off and that was $50-60 per visit! This is only $40!  Even if it breaks after one use, it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works like a charm. Just a tip to those trying it for the first time, you need to put the head flat on your back and go back and forth until the area is bald. I&#x27;m used to using clippers to shave my body hair and this is not as powerful as clippers. So you have to go over and over a spot to get it bald. It&#x27;s not a problem, just how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reached all the spots on my back, I am so happy. I tried to find a barber that would shave my back. No one would do it. And the wax treatments are really expensive and leave pimples on your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this and my back was shaven, I was so happy. I hate grabbing my shoulders or back and feeling hair.  It was a very clean shave as well. Maybe I have fine enough hair, but it shaven it down to the skin, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $40 you have to at least try it. If you&#x27;re a single guy that can&#x27;t get anyone to shave your back, you can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
    <li> This shaver works great!..perfect for back hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product several months ago. I tried it out as soon as it arrived and I was very pleasantly surprised. It was easy to use and it did remove the hair on my back in previously unreachable areas.  My only negative feedback is that it did leave some red marks on my back. But those went away in about a day. Oh yeah, here&#x27;s another negative comment: The razor only worked ONCE!! I plugged it in this morning for the SECOND TIME EVER and the sucker would not turn on?! I&#x27;ve let it charge. Still nothing. Good design, but terrible quality control. Not sure if I will buy it again. May look for another brand. True story.</li>
    <li> Easier if you have someone else to help with the hard to reach places. Good price but does not hold charge for very long, maybe one use and then re-charge.</li>
    <li> It has a strong battery and motor. That&#x27;s everything nice I have to say about the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The joints in the middle of the unit are not as firm as they should be. After about 30 seconds, one or both of the hinges in the elbow would straighten out. Pulling it back down to readjust it was time consuming and annoying. Positive stops that locked would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting surface should be angled differently (more acute). Perhaps that&#x27;s the reason I was pushing too hard but the thing just wouldn&#x27;t cut hair cleanly. which brings me to....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head would rather pull the hair than cut it. Whether I pull the shaver against the hair, with it, or across it, the cutting head yanks out as much as it cuts (if not more). It&#x27;s painful to use and took so long that eventually I just gave up.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as intended.  No frills, but none needed.</li>
    <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve got this years ago it works . I was very skeptical on moving forward with my purchase but I spend a little extra money and it was worth every penny of it. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time now and it&#x27;s OK to groom your back but it&#x27;s not even close to what you would get with a shave.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this product I first thought it seemed like an \\&quot;As Seen On TV\\&quot; type of deal and I could just be throwing money down the drain but I am happy to say I am pleasantly surprised with the quality and functionality so far! I&#x27;m usually not the type to write product reviews but I just got done using it for the first time about 15 minutes ago and I have to say that this is the best thing next to not having back hair. It was very easy to use, the blades did not pull the hair out or irritate my skin like my normal shaver does, and best of all I was able to do it myself with just the shaver and a mirror! No more suffering with the problem of back hair or trying to get someone to help you out with it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product and was limited to options but I must say it is amazing. Easy to use and I am very pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I hardly ever take the time to review items on Amazon but am so pleased with this that I wanted to come on and give this a good writeup.  I thought for sure this would just be something that I would order, try it, have it fail, and I&#x27;d send it back for a refund but this actually did an amazing job!  It has been one week since my initial use and I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout in my skin since using it!  I was very skeptical after reading some of the reviews.  I thought maybe this would just \\&quot;comb\\&quot; my hair and not do much cutting.  I thought that even if it did cut, it wouldn&#x27;t be a very close shave and would leave a lot of visible stubble that would still need to be \\&quot;Bicked off\\&quot;.  I did make several passes across my back (from my shower I wasn&#x27;t so close to my mirror so it was hard to see if I was getting it all) and I thought that with each pass, I was sure to have my skin break out in pimples and in-grown hairs.  After I was finished with it and showered it all off, I was absolutely amazed to see how close of a shave it truly gave me.  I had no visible stubble whatsoever and it looked like I had \\&quot;Bicked\\&quot; by back.  It even felt MUCH smoother than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with another reviewer that it would be nice if the arm extended to a full, straight, 180 degrees as at times it seemed a little tricky with the angle but it wasn&#x27;t so bad that I&#x27;d knock any stars off of my rating.  One or two reviews I read had me concerned about the battery life of this unit and the battery failing to hold a charge.  Even though the AA battery version of this unit is highly rated, I didn&#x27;t want to dump a bunch of money into putting batteries into this all the time and the lower amount of power that units like that often have so I decided to go with this rechargeable version.  On that note, the instructions do leave me a little puzzled.  It says that before using, you should give the unit an initial charge of 18-24 hours and that subsequent charges will take far less time.  It also says however, that when the unit is completely charged, the charging light will turn green.  After about an hour into charging this the light had already turned green.  I would&#x27;ve liked the instructions to specify if this is normal and if I should just continue with the recommended initial 18-24 hour charging.  I decided to follow the instructions and gave it an initial charge of about 20 hours before my first use.  I&#x27;ll update this later if the battery dies on me as it seems to have done for one or two other reviewers.  As of now however, the power wasn&#x27;t lacking and lasted great without any drop-off in power at all during my first use and a couple of subsequent touch-ups.  I even decided to use this on my sideburns as the sideburn clippers on my electric razor don&#x27;t work that well and this did a great job of giving me one clean, straight cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently took up cycling and fell in love with the sport as it helped me lose a lot of weight and it feels great to get out on the road.  I also started to shave my legs to avoid being the harriest cyclist on the road.  Using a gillette Pro-Glide Fusion does a great job of giving me a close shave from just above my knees and down and does the same above that but the skin on my upper legs/thighs is very sensitive and I was always breaking out.  Using the same razor on my back, great shave but I usually break out at least a little and I have to have my wife do the bulk of the work.  With this, I can do it all on my own and have almost as good of a shave on my back anyway.  I decided to try this on my legs.  Just due to the contours of the knee and shins, etc. it really isn&#x27;t a good solution for the lower leg as the blade on this is far too wide but this was exactly what I have been looking for for my thighs.  It did a great job of giving me a very close shave and I haven&#x27;t had any of the skin breakouts that I&#x27;ve had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried using some of those clippers from Wahl that a lot ofbarbers use and they basically just combed the hair on my back and legs, not to mention that they don&#x27;t have a long handle like the Mangroomer.  This unit really does a GREAT job of giving a close shave without irritation and without the need to enlist the help of my wife!  Honestly, she was skeptical but was more than happy to have me try something that she wouldn&#x27;t need to use for me.  I was pleasantly surprised and cannot recommend this highly enough!!!  If I do have battery power trouble down the road, I&#x27;ll be back to let you all know.</li>
    <li> I think the Mangroomer is a great idea. Although it is very loud and sounds just like a weed whacker, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Being a person with a hairy back its annoying when you go shirtless people stare, pick on you, tell you to take off your winter sweater. This cordless razor works excellent it reaches all of the spots on your back. I initially charged the razor before using it and have used it 3 times without having to recharge it. I would highly recommend this razor for anyone that has a hairy back.</li>
    <li> My first one didn&#x27;t survive my last move.  I couldn&#x27;t be without this as I live alone and have no one to help with the de-fleecing process.  This works perfect and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get one thing straight. I am a hairy man. I&#x27;m not shy. Haters gonna hate (as the kids says). But just to make things clear, I&#x27;m the guy who gets told by his friends to take his sweater off.....after I take off my shirt to go swimming. Mega-hairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a total bummer for my wife and I when she would shave my back for me from time to time. I can&#x27;t control it. She gets all nervous about cutting me with the trimmers. Lots of in&#x27;s and out&#x27;s. Lots of what-have-you&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine told me about the MANGROOMER. I researched it and ordered it. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and have had great results both times. I definitely use the different angles available. I like how close it gets when you take the an angle against the grain. Plenty of power even for my thick hair. Plenty of battery life to get you through a full grooming session. No cuts or irritation. Easy to clean up, too. You can just snap the top off, blow out the hair, brush off the razor head, and snap the top back on. Cake. I like that it is rechargeable but only time will tell if the battery can perform at this level long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend you try this. It&#x27;s been a game-changer for me.</li>
    <li> The original Mangroomer that was battery operated had it&#x27;s challenges, mainly that i went through double A batteries pretty often. However, this new &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; model with rechargeable battery is terrible. After my first charge/use i thought everything was fine. However, after the second charge the Mangroomer wouldn&#x27;t stay powered on for more than 5 minutes. It&#x27;s one day beyond my return window and Amazon won&#x27;t let me return it, very disappointing indeed.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. Super happy to not have to ask my wife to shave my back. One star off because it scratches my back up pretty good (it is called the mangroomer, take it like a man.) just make sure to let your significant other know where the scratches came from ahead of time so she won&#x27;t get the wrong idea!</li>
    <li> This razor is great!  I&#x27;m no longer mistaken for Sasquatch, Bigfoot, or Leakey&#x27;s Missing Link now that I can take those 3-6 inches of the fur off my back and the back of my ankles!  I no longer have to shake dry, and my spouse isn&#x27;t chided for walking such a &amp;#34;huge dog&amp;#34; (as well as cleaning up after it) when we go for our walks.  Great Danes no longer try to mate with me.  This razor has been a life-changer for me!  I do miss the braids in the middle of my back, and I also miss the messages I could shave in the middle of my back.  But I left all that behind (shaved that too) when I employed this razor! Buy it now Gorilla Boy (or woman)!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a way to shave my back. My wife didn&#x27;t have a problem with my back hair, but she would shave it for me. I found this item to be very useful in conquering my hairy back. It work great on other areas as well. I love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome! So easy to use. Painless and smooth. It came charged so I was able to use it right out of the box. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> this thing really work..amazing.</li>
    <li> Great tool for my husband to use! So glad I got it for him!</li>
    <li> Really disappointed with this product.  There is no blade guard with this product, the first time I used it it scratched back badly. My back had scratches very visible scratches not the way I wanted to look for a day at the beach.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I&#x27;m not sure why.  You have to have it at just the right angle for it to work and by that time you have gone over the same area 5 or 6 times.  This is not comfortable.  It is now collecting dust in the bottom drawer.  Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> I think for a real hairy back-mine is not hairy enough!&lt;br /&gt;Good for genital area, just be careful of the testes.</li>
    <li> Takes a little time getting used to but once mastered does a pretty good job. I am fairly pleased with this and approve.</li>
    <li> I am going to have to say this product works very well.  Very little irritation is produced. Good Job. .</li>
    <li> Just got this today. Used tonight, after charging. Works great. Back is nice and smooth. Greatest thing ever! Would recommend to everyone so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tricky to use at first, but after the first or second time, you should have it, removes hair pretty darn good. Easier &amp; cheaper &amp; less embarassing than finding a place to remove your back hair for you!!</li>
    <li> Workers well, it does take a mintue to get the hang of using it though. However, once you get the use to it its awesome!</li>
    <li> Whom ever designed this packaging needs to die a horrible death. Pretty sure I have grounds for a lawsuit.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping that this would be helpful but it misses a lot of hair and I could go over certain areas over and over again and it would still leave way too much hair to consider this trimmer as being truly beneficial.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about one a month for the past year.  It does a reasonable job but don&#x27;t expect a razor close shave.  It has a pretty strong motor and the battery lasts a long time between charges.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I charged it for an initial use, and then when I went to use it a few weeks later, the battery was dead.  I thought it just needed recharged, but after being plugged in for a day, still no charge. It doesn&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
    <li> Great value.  I wish the hinge was tighter.  It doesn&#x27;t alwasy stay where you want it too.  Otherwise a good choice.</li>
    <li> Reaches the center of the back - what else could you ask for from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(bonus: it also feels like a nice massage)</li>
    <li> Works great should have purchased it years ago.</li>
    <li> This is actually a very good product - much to my surprise</li>
    <li> The only one I have ever had that actually works well.</li>
    <li> Very good....not as close as a razor but very good and well made</li>
    <li> the mangroomer is everything they claim that it dose. The only complaint that I have is the unit doesnt get as close an you really have to work at a close cut an the head could be a 1/2\\&quot; to 1\\&quot; wider, but its less painful then a wax cheaper than laser treatment so thats why it gets 4 stars</li>
    <li> It works pretty well, but it&#x27;s easy to miss patches. I&#x27;ve used it twice and I&#x27;m getting better at it, but I still have my wife get the areas I miss.</li>
    <li> I have 2 thick patches of backhair. Unsightly? Probably but more important to me is the lack of comfort.My girlfriend had started shaving them for me but she&#x27;s gone and although \\&quot; The Mangroomer\\&quot; is alot less fun than having her do it, this machine works quite well. Be patient , take your time and the shave will be close enough and your skin will not be irritated.</li>
    <li> Guys if you want to trim some of the remnants left from our cave man ancestors this is the tool for you. Does a great job, well made. Get one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, and I really am happy with the the performance. Very easy to use, and it does a very good job. After 3 weeks of use, however, it quit working. The jury is still out on how reliable it is, but I wanted to give the manufacturer a 5 star rating for the service I received. I contacted via email the manufacturer regarding it no longer working, and at first they told me to contact the retailer I bought it through, which was Amazon.com, to receive a refund. I emailed them back and told them I do not not want a refund. I would either like it repaired or replaced. They emailed me back, asking for a full description of what was wrong with it. I received another reply from them telling me that they are shipping me a new one free of charge with a free replacement blade as well, and also told me there was no need for me to send them the old one, so I would not incur any additional expenses. I expected it to take several weeks before I would receive it, only to be pleasantly surprised to have received it 2 days later in my mailbox. As, I said I will see how this new one lasts before I review the actual product, but the manufacturer deserves 5 stars for their service.  Update 11/6/2011  The replacement is still going strong, and I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. It works well and I give it 5 stars. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the product you want. Stop searching around for something else. Buy it now. I have had thick hair on my entire back for years and in less than 10 minutes it was gone. I could not be happier. I&#x27;ve been buying things off amazon for awhile and this is the first product I have written a review for because I am so satisfied with it. Buy and get rid of your back hair before the summers over.</li>
    <li> The idea is good but the build quality of this is terrible!!  All flimsy plastic and the cutting blades are so dull that you have to rake it back and forth over one spot...  I think they were going for it not cutting/nicking your skin but it just don&#x27;t cut through hair well AT ALL!!!!  Really a 2.5 rating.</li>
    <li> 1st let me tell you I have owned this product for probably a year.  Does the job-hands down easier than anything I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Here&#x27;s the kicker.  My unit started to run slowly &amp; not hold a charge (ok...It&#x27;s over a year+ old) I figured the battery was starting to lose the ability to hold the charge.  I contacted Mangroomer via email through the link on their website &amp; inquired if the batteries could be replaced.  Without so much as a question (just wanted to know where I purchased it, a photo of the unit-&amp; copy of the receipt if I had it (I didn&#x27;t)  Said they would send me out a brand new one right away!  Holy cow!  When the unit arrived, they also included a small personal nose/ear trimmer with the completely new in box replacement unit of my original groomer.  Again-Holy cow!  I emailed them back, &amp; thanked them for replacing my unit, but for also exceeding my expectations when it came to dealing with a product problem.  Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> Very Happy with the purchase and would recommend to anyone that has the same problems that I have.  A+ product in my opinion.</li>
    <li> i really love this product, it does what it says it&#x27;s gonna do i am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> received April 3rd used 3 times will not work anymore I do not suggest anyone buy this product it is terrible and I can find no more on Amazon where it says there&#x27;s a warranty so I can send the thing back</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT TO BUZZ ALL THOSE HARD TO REACH PLACES</li>
    <li> Kind of disappointed in this product. Even this updated model still is rough on the skin and the guys who say this cuts through thick chest or back hair are off their rocker... I only use this on my back b/c I have to, but I&#x27;d go with a Wahl lithium trimmer every time for the chest and areas I can reach. Wahl blades just makes this thing&#x27;s blades look like bush-league quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a replacement for an older model and he loves it! He said it works much better than the original!! Noe he recommends it to all his friends...</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, very light,  easy to get. Difficult areas on my back  no pain involved unlike waxing or shaving</li>
    <li> The worst part about being single is not having an in-house groomer. I&#x27;ve dated women just so I can get my back shaved. Thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster I found this...no more awkward &amp;#34;It&#x27;s me, not you&amp;#34; conversations. Use is a bit daunting at first, rather like trying to sign your name with your non-dominant hand, but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I had one of the battery operated older models but it finally broke so I was excited to receive a new improved version&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the case .... the new one does not cut hair well... also the battery rechargeable is a pain as you to worry about keeping it charged....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover always pops off the blades.... all in all  they ruined a really good product</li>
    <li> Amazing product for unwanted body hair removal.  good recharge capacity.  nice reach on the back.  Easy to Clean.    I like it.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product ever invented.  I spent years having my wife shave my back, always embarrassed to ask. I have always been self conscious of my hairy back. With the Man Groomer I can reach every part of my back and do a great job in about five minutes. You simply extend the handle and it&#x27;s like using a back scratcher. Leaves no scratch marks and cuts nice and close. Worth twice the investement!</li>
    <li> Not a bad product, but not great either.  The arm makes it easy to reach everywhere.  The shave is not as close as I would prefer.</li>
    <li> My mom purchased this for me... however she now loves and is using my mangroomer. She is able to shave her legs and the big patch of hair on the center of the her back. She says &amp;#34;Two thumbs Up!&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased a Mangroomer and after about 6 months it stopped working. I changed the batteries but that was not the problem. I went to the company’s web site and filled out an email asking for a replacement. I did this three times over a three month period and never received a reply. I called the number on the site and they insisted they can’t help me because the number is only for ordering and they don’t have a number for warranty. Shocking!!!</li>
    <li> The mangroomer is very easy to use and effective.  The charge lasts for a few uses and is very effective!</li>
    <li> This works SOOO well, The charge last a good long time too. I installed one replacement head after a year or so, and is as good as new !</li>
    <li> Great idea!&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t have a rug back there, only a couple patches, it seems to reach anywhere on my back you would want to go.&lt;br /&gt;NICE not having to ask someone else to do this for you...</li>
    <li> I have tried other shavers, but this one is the best I have ever used.  Cuts the hair without pulling it, and leaves no scrape marks like some of the others.  If your in the market for this type of item, then you have to try this one.</li>
    <li> I wanted one of these for Christmas but did not recieve it so I decided to purchase it on my own.  I chose the deluxe model because of the wider shaving head on it.  My back is pretty hairy and since I hate that, I had to try this product!  It is well built and solid!  It definately takes practice but the results are great!  I tried to position myself in the mirror but kept twisting the shaver and wasnt covering my back.  It needs to stay flat for best results.  What I then decided was to shave by feel alone and this worked great for me.  You can feel the blades gently scraping along your back and when I was done I was hairless! Hairless on my back of course.  This product has been way overdue as far as Im concerned.  I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE MANGROOMER!</li>
    <li> Work great so happy I bought this</li>
    <li> good but a bit scratchy.</li>
    <li> I used it once successfully, then I opened the head to clean the blades and I couldn&#x27;t get the blades to sit tightly to each other again. So I rigged it with a wedge and it worked again for 2 minutes and then one the little pieces of plastic they used as tracks between the 2 blades broke. Had the company used a little extra stainless steel in the buzzer head instead of skimping and using plastic I probably would be a satisfied customer today. Thus, I will be sure to never to buy another product from Marut Enterprises, LLC due to the poor workmanship of their products and I hope that this review will prevent others from wasting their money on this product.</li>
    <li> This back hair trimmer is of much higher quality than others that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  The shaver head stays on well and the entire trimmer has a more durable feel.  With the extender, you can reach all areas of your back pretty easily.  One thing to note:  it won&#x27;t operate while plugged in...you have to wait until it&#x27;s charged and unplug the AC adapter...</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. First time user last night. I did it over the sink to check results. I had a pile of nappy ass hair the size of Alaska! I had gotten a massage last week and am now sorry for that poor lady having to kneed through my man carpet. I had enough hair on my back to weave a full sized area rug! Quality build, easy to use, no nicks. Buy it if you want to upgrade from mediocre bar ho&#x27;s to movie star chicks.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does the job. Very gentle on skin. But I wished the blade should be more sharp. Have to use 3-4 times at the same spot to get good and clean hair trim.</li>
    <li> Good close cut without pinching.</li>
    <li> Have used this for 1 year now, about every two months.  Great product and very effective at reaching my entire back.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is very good and was delivered at exactly expected day. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  This is trimmer, not shaver. It trims the hair closely. You have get use to it. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> So far has done the job just fine, bought a replacement head too, but seems they will last a long time using this about every two weeks or so. Pretty good ergonomics on the thing.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for my needs. I&#x27;d def buy another one if I needed it, but I&#x27;d def recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this for very long, but for what it is it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that a few days after I bought it it went from like 40$ to almost 70.. so.. not sure what racket they&#x27;re running here on Amazon but buyer beware.  40$ was what I paid.. although I&#x27;d pay a little more.. no way if it&#x27;s higher than 50</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago... it worked fin, the razor is a bit rough on the skin, but ok I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It died on me a few days ago, thought the battery was dead, so had it connected to the charger, green light went on, left it there to charge for a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never worked again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 star is for the poor reliability, this is not an item that is used every day, maybe once a month... and after a few months it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Mangroomer sent me a replacement unit, works perfect. Gave it 4 stars. Loses one star for the very sharp metal razor which can hurt your skin.</li>
    <li> Good device with the extendable handle, and the lithium batteries.  Works well.</li>
    <li> If you have a hairy back (like me) and you don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune getting waxed at the salon, you need this.  The mangroomer is easy to use, shaves closely and won&#x27;t leave nicks or scratches on your back.  I have one of those mirrored medicine cabinets where you can open a couple doors and it works like a 3-way mirror - makes it much easier to see your back while you shave.</li>
    <li> Works very well to keep trimmed up on hard to reach areas like your back. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice groomer and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Seriously this product has vastly improved my life. I have recommended this to all of my friends. This is my second one, I had the first model for about 6 years before a broke it (All my fault these things are pretty rugged) I would absolutely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. A little awkward to use on my back but what can you expect. It does scratch me some and leaves red marks. Also does not cut very close much less than a normal neck trimmer. The following is an update I barely even used it and after a couple months went by the battery charges slower and slower and it can&#x27;t even shave the whole back with one charge. At the 2 year mark right when the warranty ran out it stopped charging. I am changing it from 3 stars to 1 star. Now it is going in the garbage. My advice do not by.</li>
    <li> One of the best features of the product is that it holds a charge for months. It is the easiest DIY back grooming that I have come across. But it can also be used to shave any other area of the body.</li>
    <li> Works great just as advertised. Easy reach.</li>
    <li> This thing works great and doesn&#x27;t take long to shave those hard to reach areas on your back. I would suggest this product and buy from this seller again</li>
    <li> I am very happy with product. Good quality and does what it is suppose to do. Have recommended this product to others.</li>
    <li> It works well for personal grooming. battery life not great, and it wont run on ac power when plugged in. has to be charged. I would change that if I owned this company.&lt;br /&gt;So plan ahead to get it charged before grooming</li>
    <li> What a waste of money! I bought this for almost $50. It was working great for the first few times. After 6th or 7th times using Mangroomer, clippers stopped moving and it wouldn&#x27;t groom! After cleaning it up, turning it on and off a few times, and re-recharging (just to make sure it&#x27;s not the battery) it worked again for two more times!&lt;br /&gt;The same thing happened again yesterday! It was making noise but no movement and no shaving!! I cleaned it up, recharged it and... but no luck!&lt;br /&gt;I just checked their website and they have a \\&quot;30 day warranty\\&quot;! I don&#x27;t know how useful is that (at least not for me anymore after less than 3 months)! That&#x27;s how they compete with established brands like Phillips!</li>
    <li> This shaver is pretty awesome.  If you are like me and you are an animal but love to go to the beach, definitely buy this.  It is a good design, and the charge lasts a long time.  I have tried other shavers but none of them compare and they break.  I have only had this a few months now but so far it works well.  It obviously can&#x27;t get all the way to the skin for the closet shave but it gets much closer than I was expecting and is fairly easy to use.  It&#x27;s better than nothing and if you keep up with it it gets much easier.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cut, very smooth...  I wish the charge could last a little longer, runs out really easy</li>
    <li> About the only negative thing I have to say about this product was amazon&#x27;s delivery of it. I chose Prime Two Day Delivery and I got it a week after ordering, but the product itself works great. Some complain that they conk out after awhile but I won&#x27;t need to shave my back very often anyway. I used the man groomer for the first time this morning before my shower and A) It felt good to use, like scratching my back with one of the Chinese wooden back scratchers. B) It removed all the hair on my back, not that I have ever been one of these Neanderthal types you see n the beach now and then. C) It did not leave my back feeling raw. It feels fine. If you&#x27;re a guy who has A LOT of hair on your back, by all means get one of these. If, more like me, you just have some hair on your back and you want it off, what the heck? It works. Go for it.</li>
    <li> Due to an unforeseen job layoff, I&#x27;ve had plenty of time to spend at the pool this summer. I&#x27;ve never been particularly concerned about my hairy back until I saw all the other hairy backs at the pool! I&#x27;m not excessively hairy, but I do have enough to make me think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results after using the Mangroomer. I was surprised and thrilled with how quickly and efficiently it trimmed the hair. The adjustable angle and length of the handle makes it very easy to reach all spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it easier to use when I did not look in the mirror for the most part. Cleaning up small areas did require the use of the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave some short stubble that you can feel but it isn&#x27;t very noticeable unless you look very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged the groomer in when I received it and let it charge up overnight. It provided more than enough charge to finish my back.</li>
    <li> Reaches around to my back just fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Now I am unafraid to visit the zoo.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Mangroomer last week to tackle some light (but noticeable) back hair.  The trimmer cuts the hair very short without \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; it.  I chose this device for that reason. I didn&#x27;t want my back to become \\&quot;scratchy\\&quot; like after a day or so of not shaving my face.  Great product...</li>
    <li> Love it.  I don&#x27;t have to dislocate my shoulder to reach my back anymore.  It used to be a work out, very easy now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly two years now. I should also say that I am a really hairy guy. My back and shoulders get completely covered in thick, inch+ plus long hair when it&#x27;s fully grown out. I don&#x27;t know if much has changed with this model since I bought it, but if you are similarly hairy as I am, I recommend looking for something with a better blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it gets the job done. The extendable, folding handle make it relatively easy to reach any part of the back, although curvatures and bones still make it tough to hit all the hairs. A full charge will last at least one whole shaving session (it takes me a while to do my entire back, but I&#x27;ve never run out of power if I&#x27;m starting on a full charge). However, unless you use it lightly, I recommend making sure you charge it before every use because it might not have enough juice for a second shave, and the cutter won&#x27;t run while it&#x27;s charging. They also include one of those dinky cleaning brushes, which is actually good for precise cleaning in small spots, but I would really like if it included a larger brush closer to the size of the cutter for cleaning the broader areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe is with the cutter. Honestly, the cutter is of garbage quality. With the thick, long hair on my back, it takes several, slow passes over a spot to get it all trimmed down to satisfaction. Forget about getting it smooth. That&#x27;s not possible for me, but that&#x27;s also not important for me. I have a regular $20 Remington electric razor from many years ago that cuts through any and all hair like it&#x27;s not even there. That&#x27;s what I need this to do for my back. This cutter will probably work just fine for you if you only have small patches of hair or thin hair on your back. But if you&#x27;ve got serious back hair, I would look for something more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, this cutter deserves some credit because shaving my back before I got it was extremely difficult. It&#x27;s easier now, but far from perfect. At the time of my purchase, it was about $44. From my experience with it, I would pay $20-30 for it if I couldn&#x27;t find something better, and I would definitely look for something better.</li>
    <li> In my experience, inexpensive grooming tools tend to be trash can worthy, not the case here.  For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting something so functional.  Granted, it feels fairly cheaply made, but it performs extremely well.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and it&#x27;s still working great.  rather than write a long winded review, let&#x27;s just get to it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Shaves close, IF you get the blade positioning correct&lt;br /&gt;+Outstanding battery life...and you&#x27;ll need it, especially when you first start out, &#x27;cuz it takes a long time shave your own back (even now it takes me 30 minutes to get it nice and clean, it was probably closer to an hour the first time.)&lt;br /&gt;+Good adjust-ability of length and angle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-You need to be pretty flexible to use this, it can get tiring at times.&lt;br /&gt;-Very sensitive to blade angle.  If you don&#x27;t have the perfect blade angle it doesn&#x27;t do much except pull out your hair.  It seems to work best with a pushing motion.  I&#x27;ve had very little success in the opposite direction.&lt;br /&gt;-Loud?&lt;br /&gt;-Can leave your back a little scuffed up, but goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I couldn&#x27;t expect much more for this price.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Worked just like it said it would. If you&#x27;re unsure, buy it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love a company that stands behind their product. And this is the case of Mangroomer. My mangroomer went dead within the year of the purchase and I vented my frustration in Amazon and in the company&#x27;s site. They not only sent me a new machine, but also threw in a replacement blade!!!&lt;br /&gt;The Mangroomer does an excellent job in \\&quot;shredding\\&quot; off the hair of your back and the beauty of it is that you can do it on your own!</li>
    <li> It does a good job shaving, but the battery charge doesn&#x27;t last long and it takes hours to recharge. I don&#x27;t know if it is just mine or they are all this way.</li>
    <li> arrived and worked as desired. Does not act like a shaver, but takes care of the trimming hair, works well as described.</li>
    <li> I got the Mangroomer today, used it, showered, and sat down to write a review right away. Amazing. It&#x27;s actually better than I thought it would be, and I had some pretty positive expectations. It came fully charged, and lasted the entire time I needed it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me say that if you are worried about reaching all areas, or that the razor size is too small, forget those concerns. If you can take 5-10 minutes to do a really good shave on your face, you can spend 10-15 with this product. I have a very hairy back, and this thing was literally mowing patches off me. It does take a little bit to get the angles right, but by the end, I feel like I couldn&#x27;t miss a section of my back if I tried. And I am NOT a coordinated person. The trick is to switch hands and switch directions. The back-scratcher method is awesome, as many reviewers have pointed out, but there&#x27;s the reach-around too. That&#x27;s where you go horizontally across your back, switching sides and hands. I think because the razor is so efficient, it only takes a few strokes up and down (haha) and side to side to really get rid of everything. The hair left over, is barely noticeable. I think someone else mentioned a peach-fuzz type feeling, I&#x27;d agree, adding it&#x27;s a soft non-bristly feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the amount of hair on the bathroom floor was like half the amount left over after a proper haircut. A quick vacuum to keep the mrs. happy, and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had any concerns, it would be the packaging.. I hate that plastic you have to find scissors or a knife to open. Nothing to do with product performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jointed arm did \\&quot;unclick\\&quot; once or twice on me, so I had to pause and re-click it. This is not the products fault, but my own haste to use it. You don&#x27;t have to go slow and steady, just normal speed (definitely not psycho with a weed whacker speed.) Also, the razor did not hurt at all, during the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to do the shoulders, thin out around the bicep, and get the back of your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this product and highly recommend it for guys that have been waiting for an easy to use AND effective back hair shaver.</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing. If it wasn&#x27;t for Amazon, I don&#x27;t even think I would have known this product existed. Very good/excellent results with this Mangroomer. I know I&#x27;m not Plasticman, this product definetely solves the problem of getting those very hard to reach back hairs. I already have a Bodygroomer, that get&#x27;s some body hair, this gets just about all. I would highly reccomend this product. Another great product find, thanks to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  I like the wide blade, and it&#x27;s pretty helpful to reach the back where I have these random hairs that are typically unreachable.  It doesn&#x27;t fold out flat, but still works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Very well built and sturdy!</li>
    <li> i think this might be the best trimmer for back hair out there.. i have tried different groomers.. it trims here down to the skin.. very easy to use and effective.. would definitely recommend...</li>
    <li> What a great item. Took me about 10 minutes to get rid of my horse mane. Worked &amp; even feels better than anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it up &amp; down, over your shoulders, for the top part of your back. Then side to side, back &amp; forth on the bottom. Mirror use is for checking only since the opposite reflection just throws you off. Before you shower is best too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only way I ever felt the smoothness of my shirt against me was by going to the local spa, which is pricey &amp; sometimes awkward for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Really makes the task of shaving your back a much easier task! Has a great feel!  Similar to a facial shaver that you have to go over the same area a few times to get a clean look!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Mangroomer simply has some of the best customer support I&#x27;ve ever had the privilege of dealing with. After writing my original review, I was quickly contacted by their service department, and offered a brand new Mangroomer at no cost, and it arrived in just a couple days. Now that I have a fully functional groomer, I can say that it works amazingly.     How can you go wrong with a company that&#x27;s willing to go above and beyond to make sure they&#x27;re customers are happy? Even if you wind up with a defective device, you can rest assured that they&#x27;ll take care of it for you.     OLD REVIEW:  It works great... when it works. My unit may have a defective battery, because even after letting it charge for hours, it only lasts about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Works as it should. Charged fine, smooth shaving</li>
    <li> I am glad I don&#x27;t have to rely on the significant other to perform this task! I now do it on my schedule and don&#x27;t have to wait!</li>
    <li> Good reach for those hard to get places.  Does not rip or tear the hair, just trims it!  Super easy to use.</li>
    <li> easy to reach entire back, vary smooth. Easy to clean. Charges vary fast. No complaints from this guy, I will recommend this product highly!!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed as the upgrades compared to earlier models are just aesthetic. It took me several passes to get an acceptable trim, head / blade system needs improvement.</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied, it won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
    <li> This shaver really is easy to use. I particularly like the wide cutting head and the extending/foldable handle.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well! I should of paid more attention to the poor reviews but guess I can tape one of my other electric shavers and just use it as a handle.</li>
    <li> WARNING, this is a shaver, not a trimmer. It won&#x27;t just shorten your body hair, it will shave it off completely! If you just want to tame your body hair (instead of removing it completely) use a beard trimmer instead of this device.</li>
    <li> Take this review from a guy who has been mistaken for big foot while walking the beach.  One day while looking in the mirror I realized that I had to do something about the hair on my back, it was terrible.  I have a clipper for my head but my wife never wanted to help me with my back and I couldn&#x27;t do it myself.  So I looked into various back shaving devices.  I obviously chose this one. I can tell you that it really works great, I love it. It&#x27;s rechargeable which is what I Liked the best and it has a telescoping handle that has no problem reaching all parts of my back. The head comes off for cleaning and you can replace the blade if needed. But the blade isn&#x27;t like a razor that frequently need changing. The only fault in my opinion is that the head should be a little wider.  You will not be disappointed with this handy machine.</li>
    <li> Works as is should. Made a little cheap for $50 or it would get 5 stars. Normal good service from Amazon and shipping was faster than the tracking indicated. It leaves a little stubble but keeps Big Foot from following you around to take your picture.</li>
    <li> This makes getting those back hairs so much easier.  Gets a fairly close cut and doesnt scratch up my back.  Unless your girlfriend/wife loves shaving your back for you I would recommend getting one of these!</li>
    <li> That battery  would not recharge after 3 uses. Therefore the unit is now worthless.  A total wast of my money.</li>
    <li> My kids teased me about the amount of hair on my back so I decided to surprise them and trim it.  This product worked great and made it very easy to trim the hair on my back.  Works as advertized.</li>
    <li> This thing rocks!!! Shaves off the back hair easy could get a little closer but it&#x27;s not a razor. I would highly recommend the mangroomer if you want to shave your back by your self.</li>
    <li> does not hold a charge very long... otherwise works great</li>
    <li> This product works almost exactly as advertised. It has good battery life, is easy to adjust, and makes it easy to reach your entire back. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I would like, but that is to be expected from as electric shaver. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just what the hairy back guy needs.  It&#x27;s easy to use by yourself.  You don&#x27;t even need a mirror.  It takes a while to charge (like hours) but its worth the wait because you can go from a hairy to a smooth in minutes with no worries of cutting your back.  My only beef is the handle which you can adjust to change the angle does stay put.  You are constantly having to reset it.</li>
    <li> I love this! I am finally able to remove my body hair with ease. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great Product, exactly what I was looking for could not find it on the net any cheaper.  Great quality and construction.</li>
    <li> This product works awesome! Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Carved my back to shreds. No good!!</li>
    <li> does as promised , after years  of not being able to take  care of this problem myself, i can does a great job I also purchased the BIG MOUTH BACKSPA between the bothof them i could not be happeir</li>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t need this product, but I do, and because I do, and it does a great job, I am happy to give it a 5 star review.  It always does the job, and does it well.  If you suffer from hair in places you don&#x27;t want, you should buy it too.</li>
    <li> It just works awesome. It is a Must have item if you want to shave your back without any help!!</li>
    <li> The concept of this device amuses me quite a bit, but I bought it and I used it for the first time yesterday.  My back felt great right after, but was a little itchy later on in the night.  Nothing bad though.  The handle extends out to be plenty long.</li>
    <li> For years I have had the problem of a hairy back , so I would tape a razor to a broom handle to get the job done. Now that I have the Mangroomer the job is so simple, just the right angle and in a manner of minutes the job is done safe, clean and perfect.</li>
    <li> my husband has used it several times...so far so good...based on other reviews, I hope it holds up over time.</li>
    <li> Works great on hard to reach areas. I had the original version and this is a better improvement. It has a power charging station instead of the batteries. I like the battery option in case you loose the charger.</li>
    <li> This shaver gets the hair off your back, but it does not get close and smooth like my old shaver (broke after 4 years). Also, the &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; shape is a bit awkward, my old shaver was straight (with extender attachment) and handled better. I will use it a second time...</li>
    <li> Used it 2wice. Does not work anymore. I am not sure what the battery life on this thing is, but I expect for than 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE*****&lt;br /&gt;Contacted Mangroomer and requested a replacement. They sent the replacement pronto. Extremely satisfied with the customer service. I am still to start using the new product received.</li>
    <li> Sorry I waited so long to get this.  It is easy to work, made very well and works perfect every time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a couple years and they are an awesome product. My chick lost my charger so I had to buy another one. They last and shave really close so it&#x27;s way better than Nair and more convenient than waxing. Do it. Your back hair is gross.</li>
    <li> I had the previous model before and I dreaded using it. I would always end up with my back all scratched and chewed up by the blades. The blades on this newer model are much better. They are designed just like normal clippers where the bottom blade is slightly shorter than the top blade (unlike the old model where they were the same) . The edges of the blade are also slightly rounded, instead of with squared edges. This just makes the trimmer slide across the skin much smoother. I rarely scratch myself with these now. My only complaint is the rechargeable batter that is not replaceable. That makes this thing pretty much disposable since NIMH batteries usually only last a year or two.</li>
    <li> Purchased for son....he loves it...very easy to use and charges quick. I would recommend this product for its ease of use and getting the job done.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and used it for about 2 months when it up and died on me. Refused to hold a charge and I was outside of the 30 day window on the warranty. I e-mailed Mangroomer and after following a few instructions they promptly shipped me a new one free of charge. That one is still charging (an 18-24 hour initial charge is instructed) but I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no easier way to remove back hair at home without assistance. Here&#x27;s hoping quality control comes through and this unit holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Upped the star rating. Replacement unit has given me no problems. In fact it is still on its first charge (with use about every 2 weeks).</li>
    <li> I wish they had this years ago!  Good product, works well.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a little cheaply made, maybe could break easily if dropped.  But it works like it should.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. The first 2 times, it left a few scratches in the harder to reach areas of my back but then it was easier to use and no problems. Looks great when finished, just need to keep up with cleaning it so it lasts.</li>
    <li> I had one of these that was battery operated. It lasted about three years before it broke. It wasn&#x27;t great and I was a little hesitate to purchase this one, but there aren&#x27;t many alternatives on the market. So, I bit the bullet and bought this professional model. Blade seems much better and It didn&#x27;t pull the hair like my last one. Glad I made the purchase and didn&#x27;t let all the bad reviews turn me off on this product. This one works great!</li>
    <li> Easy to use!  Very close shave!  My wife is happy also!  Good battery life!  Wish I would have found this sooner.</li>
    <li> The older model, the &amp;#34;non-cordless&amp;#34; one was MUCH BETTER, this model newer model mangroomer, does not cut throught hair as easlily. I&#x27;m quite dissatisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Good product for trimming body hair.  Easily reached your back hair for beach season.  Works just like a back scratcher, just turn it on and go.  One drawback, is that you tend to get random scratches in you back, so I would recommend using it a day or two before you have to go shirtless so you don&#x27;t look like you were attacked by a cat.</li>
    <li> Just have to keep it clean or it pulls the hairs. Very good with the extension and able to recharge.</li>
    <li> I was looking into this because i have tried it all. Nair for men, back spa, the one with the razor blade on the end, I seen this and read some of the reviews and i went out and got one it worked very well for me you have to go in a up and down motion on your back and with the extender you can reach all of the hard to get places on your back. I bought this at Bed Bath and Beyond for $19.95. so save your money and do not pay $43 bucks for this.</li>
    <li> This works but it&#x27;s really kinda hard to use, you have to angle it right and it&#x27;s  kind of annoying</li>
    <li> Easy to use and gets the job done! I would recommend it to anyone! It truly is a great product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for about 10 years.  It does a wonderful job, but it&#x27;s a little rough on the skin.  DON&#x27;T try it on your privates!  For underarms and more, ahem, sensitive areas, I use the Phillips Norelco Bodygroom, which is great for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Great for removal of body hair.....back, chest, pubic areas. Does not pinch or cut tender skin areas. Very clean shave without all the mess. Not as close as waxing but a heck of alot cheaper!</li>
    <li> It works great. Can be a little tough the first time getting the angles downright that you need, but once you get that down works so great. Trims the hair very close.</li>
    <li> This item does allow you to trim hard to reach places, but it&#x27;s bulky and awkward to use, and requires you to twist and turn in front of the mirror.</li>
    <li> The handle is awesome.  Don&#x27;t know how long it will last but it is working so far.  I am turning into a metrosexual I guess.</li>
    <li> You can shave a gorilla as smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass with this puppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made, runs quite...works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge lasts FOREVER!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!! It works amazingly well! Doesn&#x27;t have to rely on me to shave his back for him! Great gift I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love my mangroomer no complaints about the unit. The only problem I have is that I lost the adapter and I&#x27;m trying to buy a new adapter but the only problem is no where on the unit does it give you the voltage.most items 12 volts etc. I&#x27;m growing so much hair over the last 2 weeks that there offering me a part on the next planet of the apes. Someone please help</li>
    <li> Works well. Happy with results. Sharp ends have resulted in some abrasions.</li>
    <li> Works better than I expected. Nice product.</li>
    <li> PIECE OF S***!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. CHARGE LASTS ABOUT 1 MINUTE.</li>
    <li> What a great thing. While being by myself at my exchange semester and having no one who could help me with grooming issues, this is maybe the best thing I bought so far. Sure, it needs some practice, that&#x27;s for sure. But once you have it, it is quite decent and grooming results are great! Clear recommendation.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin too badly and takes care of my back well.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised and I can recommend it. Keep the cutting edge flat against your skin is probably the biggest learning curve with this device.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple: This is the best product currently available on the market for removing back hair without having to ask your girlfriend/wife/friend/whoever to do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing inherently disgusting about back hair on a man. It&#x27;s no different than chest hair or leg hair. In fact, my back hair is quite fine and soft and silky. Seriously. It&#x27;s easily the next softest hair on my body after the hair on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, when I take my shirt off it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing a sweater or anything. I&#x27;ve got a healthy chest of hair which I&#x27;m DAMN proud of and would never shave off EVER! Burt Reynolds, David Hasselhoff, all James Bonds up to Pierce Brosnan, and Austin Powers are my chest hair heroes. But it doesn&#x27;t extend onto my arms or shoulders. My back however, while not uniformly covered, has large &amp;#34;continents&amp;#34; of hair on the left and right sides of my back from my shoulder blades to midway down my back. The hairs themselves aren&#x27;t thick or especially dark but there are a lot of them and they grow kinda long (an inch, give or take).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wear my chest hair like an erotic cuirass of opulent man-armor, the back hair doesn&#x27;t quite have the same... primal sexuality to it. It reminds more of old fat guys at the pool. And if you&#x27;re currently or hoping to soon woo a lady, that map of the world growing on your back has gotta go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[TL;DR starts now]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN COMES THE MANGROOMER...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I saw in other reviews that I want to dispel right out is the complaint about it leaving red scratch marks all over your back. DUH! You&#x27;re dragging an electric trimmer with little metal teeth all over your back. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s actually like a reeeaaally good back scratcher. But yeah, it leaves your back covered in red scratch marks. And guess what? They go away in like 20-30 minutes. That&#x27;s just how human skin reacts to irritation. It&#x27;s temporary. A plain old backscratcher does the same thing. So unless you&#x27;re using the Mangroomer to shave your back like RIGHT before prancing out to the pool, this is a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It trims VERY close if you don&#x27;t rush the process and you&#x27;re thorough. Almost just as good as shaving cream and a razor blade. My back feels very soft and smooth after using the Mangroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use. Stand in front of the bathroom mirror with your back toward it, hold a hand-held mirror in one hand so you can see your back in the big bathroom mirror behind you and the Mangroomer in the other hand. The adjustable length is great. I recommend doing the top and middle of your back using the over-the-shoulder method with the length fully extended or close to it. Then shorten the length of the Mangroomer most of the way and reach across your chest and around your side to trim the sides of your back and your lower back. It takes me about five minutes to do my entire back now. You get better at it with each use as you learn what tactics work best for you and become familiar with the contours of your back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little noisy but not too noisy - about the same as the electric trimmer a barber uses. Seems to be a sturdy, well-made, quality product. Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. Nice matte, non-slippery feel to it. I haven&#x27;t tested its charge too much. I leave it plugged into the charger when not in use. It&#x27;s never had any trouble keeping a charge through the process of shaving my back. But again, I haven&#x27;t experimented with multiple uses between charges or with leaving it off the charger for extended periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want to keep my back in good shape I use the Mangroomer about once a week. Sometimes I go longer out of laziness. I&#x27;ve only used it about 10-15 times now but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be decreasing in effectiveness so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPARED TO THE RAZORBA (non-electric version):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the Razorba in the past, which is pretty much a plastic stick with a holder on the end for you to stick the handle of a standard facial hair razor in. So you use the Razorba like a regular razor with shaving cream. It&#x27;s a piece of crap that they charge you up $70 for. It&#x27;s awful. Only the cheapest plastic Bic razors with the pencil-thick handles will fit in it well. I tried it with my Mach 3 razor and I had to really jam it in for it to fit and even then, it only went halfway in (yeah yeah, that&#x27;s what she said). Then when I wanted to remove my Mach 3 from the Razorba I had to kinda yank on it to get it out... only to find that the thick rubber tube inside the Razorba that &amp;#34;grips&amp;#34; the handle of the razor you put in it actually ripped out of the Razorba WITH my Mach 3! The little rubber tube only had a simple screw holding it into the Razorba, and a medium-strength yank was all it took to pop it off the screw. Once I managed to remove the rubber tube from the handle of my Mach 3, I found it was next to impossible to fit the rubber tube over the head of the screw inside the Razorba again. So it was pretty much busted. Money down the drain after like 2 uses. Not to mention the repeated &amp;#34;backscratching&amp;#34; motion you had to use with it for it to be effective, which resulted in lots of razor burn. And the cost of completely dulling your expensive razor blades. I haven&#x27;t tried the electric version of the Razorba, but at twice the cost of the Mangroomer I&#x27;m skeptical that it&#x27;s not a ripoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No question. The Mangroomer is the ONLY quality option.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have used. It shaves fairly close and gets every where on my back I need to reach. I use it for front too. This is my second one, my other was not the rechargeable one and got destroyed when I moved. this one is much better.  I have a different shaver for my other parts because its not very sensitive to the soft areas. The product does what it says and the blades never seem to dull, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far. Lives to its promises. I still get a cut here and there. But I still prefer it over the competition or razor blades.</li>
    <li> Keeping your back free of hair is not the easiest thing to do by yourself, but the Mangroomer Professional sure does make it easier and keeps my back looking nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;No pulling or scratching, just clean cutting of the unwanted back hair with the convenience of multiple angles and lengths to the arm making it reach all areas of your back. Nice and sturdy too and I like the texture of the handle, which is rubber like for a better grip.&lt;br /&gt;No more will I get a sprained neck reaching around with a razor to try to get that area between my scapulas, which of course is where the majority of the undesirable  back hair resides, in my case at least.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and have one recommendation for anyone not getting as good a result as I am experiencing.  Make sure the shaver is fully charged or if you have the other model with batteries, make sure you have fresh, full force batteries at all times as even a slight change in motor strength might affect your results, especially if you have a real rug growing back there!&lt;br /&gt;I also had the occasion to deal with customer service regarding some questions I had and they were absolutely the most professional bunch I have dealt with in a long time. So if you want tips or help with your product, I can only say that this company delivers.&lt;br /&gt;I know everyone might have different experiences with the same product, but for me this is a 5 star item because it performs better than my expectation, is well built and solid along with A+ customer care- and with the great Amazon price, I highly recommend the Professional, if only for the convenience of rechargeable battery vs. using your own.</li>
    <li> I have more hair on my back than I do on my head. My wife has been spared the task of grooming me, now I can do it for myself</li>
    <li> This product is overprice and does not fulfill most of the statements that are claimed by the manufacturer. It has a bad reach angle and does not cut well</li>
    <li> good design, solid assembly, but does leave some light scratch marks on back&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;(this sentence is only here to reach the minimum word count)</li>
    <li> My Wife would have bought this for me just to avoid &amp;#34;mowing the back 40&amp;#34;.  I am glad I can now take care of this periodic task on my own!  This works well, and it doesn&#x27;t tear up my skin which is nice.</li>
    <li> I really like this. Once you do the initial trim the maintenance is easy. Not a close shave like a razor but close enough for day to day. No razor burn and no cuts no bumps. I use this once a week and keeps a good charge.</li>
    <li> This MANGROOMER is a great tool and I am so happy I got mine. I shave my back and chest with it and ever shave my face with it because it is really a nice close shave and cuts cleanly. My only issue is the head (not the cutting blade) of the unit is brittle and breaks very easily and the cutting head does not stay on very well with this one flaw. Other than this one flaw it is clearly one of the greatest products for back shaving.</li>
    <li> The company offers a 1 yr. warranty on the product. The last one I bought stopped working one fine day. I called and emailed the company and they didn&#x27;t bother to return calls (after noting down the issue) or respond to emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as the product works fine, this should be a non-issue. If you have any problem with the product during the warranty period - good luck. The company won&#x27;t bother to take any interest.</li>
    <li> This thing scratched the hell out of me... and this is the new version that has the rounded teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried different positions and pressure... I would still get scratched.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and got the job done. Not much more to say but it sure beats the hell out of using a razor. Back hair grew back in about a week but each time it definitely grows back a little less coarse.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT LOVE IT IT WORKS VERY WELL ITS CLAN AND NEET. THANKS AGAIN FOR MAKING A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE CONSUMER</li>
    <li> Does what it says, good product, would buy again. Handle extends to reach where others can&#x27;t. Seems to track better and NO pinching, great product for doing those hard to reach places on your back.</li>
    <li> Great to keep your back free of hair. My partner loves a smooth back and this does the trick.I love how I look in a crop top. Thanks for the quick service.</li>
    <li> Just received mine today and in a matter of minutes a problem that I&#x27;ve had for years disappeared. Very simple to use, didn&#x27;t leave any scratches, and can easily be stored away. I recommend this product for anyone that needs the back grass to be mowed without assistance.</li>
    <li> Sadly I need it...but my 4 stars are for the idea of the product and it&#x27;s design. The rechargeable battery would be my biggest complaint...but i guess I would actually buy something like it when this finally  dies..again ..because I have a need for it.  The battery doesn&#x27;t last has problems charging and I wish it worked when just plugged in...I mean every bathroom has a outlet.</li>
    <li> Works great for tough to reach parts of back</li>
    <li> well&lt;br /&gt;when  I used the mangroomer for the first time I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those hard to reach spots.</li>
    <li> It works ok. Takes a while to charge up. It does give a clean shave</li>
    <li> Works alright but with cut you if you are not careful</li>
    <li> Grate machine love it thanks</li>
    <li> Works pretty good.  Not as well as I hoped, but it is fine.  It doesn&#x27;t reach the back areas easily, but with moving around, you can get to those areas.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT FOR REMOVING BACK HAIR FAST AND DOING IT YOURSELF !!!! WORTH THE $50.............MAKES A CLOSE SHAVE......CLOSER THAN I THOUGHT !!!!!</li>
    <li> trims hair without problem.  Has not cut me so far.  Good product for trimming my hair on any part of my body</li>
    <li> This particular mangroomer is much better than the other battery operated one. This one actually cuts the hair even shorter and the motor sounds like its really working hard. I hope i don&#x27;t have to buy another one because i am using it about 2 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;The  battery operated one used to go bad after a few uses because the motor just stops working. I am hoping the same doesn&#x27;t happen with the professional one.</li>
    <li> Holds a long charge, never nicks, long handle allows you to access all parts of your back. A must have for men with the Wookie gene.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. It doesn&#x27;t cut me like trimmers do.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. Takes a few times of getting use to but it definitely gets the job done! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Slick. The device AND my former hairy back! Read all the reviews, and am glad I paid a little more for the rechargable model. It has more power, and you will be glad for that. Fully charged it the first time and it was still going strong when I was out of hair for it to cut. Somebody was doing all the thinking when they designed this. I have no complaints. Be advised that this is not a razor. It does not shave you totally smooth. It is very, very close, so it is just fine for me. I can&#x27;t imagine any other do-it-yourself device that would do a better job without cutting you to ribbons.</li>
    <li> I had the original and used it for several years before it started to grab the hair rather can cut it. Bought this model as a replacement and am pretty amazed at how much better it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This cuts about as close as I can imagine getting without using a blade, only need to use it every couple of weeks and In have hair that is dark and coarse. Definitely not a SMOOTH shave, but looks and feels a lot better. (My wife thinks it feels too rough immediately after shaving, but feels ok and looks better after a day or so).&lt;br /&gt;-Much gentler on the skin than the original. I always had long red scratches after using the previous version, sometimes even bleeding. This version causes some light abrasion but not scratches or welts - the &amp;#34;corners&amp;#34; or edges of the cutting surface seem more rounded or smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to how well the batteries hold up yet, but the actual experience of using it is much improved.</li>
    <li> Solid built, quiet motor, smooth shaving head.  Shaver arm reach is more than sufficient.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> prefer the phillips bodygroom(?) line cause they give a closer shave, but I am able to get the center top of back easier than with the phillips.</li>
    <li> I give it that rating because it did what is was built for, I am having the best possible shave for my back now , more than ever. So, to my fellow hairy guys out this , this product does the job well</li>
    <li> Excellent product, use it often, never fails me. You need to understand physics before using it on yourself.  If your dumb, you may cut yourself. Just think before using. It does a great job!</li>
    <li> Did not like it it felt like it was pulling hair off skin was painful would not buy product again</li>
    <li> I got this for my fiance as a joke christmas present but he loves it!! its more of a gift for the two of us. lol</li>
    <li> After 10 years of duct taping my electric razor to my crow bar  I am in heaven with this!  I am as hairy as hairy can get and this thing rocks. Customer service with this company is second to none.  Had battery issues and emailed them and had a response within minutes.  Being a business owner myself I can tell you this company and its product is AWESOME!- Matt- Stoughton, Wisconsin</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase! It was as easy to use as they advertised and works great. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> As a trimmer this product works well and efficiently. Unfortunately it does not get nearly as close to a shave. If you have a very hairy back this will trim you down in no time and with a quick  follow up shave you will be silky smooth like the zohan.&lt;br /&gt;Also makes a huge mess so stay in the shower or place a towel under you.&lt;br /&gt;BUT&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PAY $60+ for this. I bought mine at Bed Bath for $39.99 then 20% off coupon&#x3D; around $35.</li>
    <li> Just the type of product I was looking for, it works great. I wish I knew about it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product it&#x27;s perfect for grooming areas hard to reach</li>
    <li> This works good men.  If you have unwanted hair, go this rout.  It takes a little while to shave the back in the mirror but, the shaver is great quality for the price and the battery charges pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Shaving your back has never been easier.  Hey, it does what it&#x27;s designed to do.  Essentially an electric razor with an angled handle to reach those hard to reach areas.  Seems well made and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Although it can be tricky to learn the best ways or angles of using it.  I have no complaints.  Be careful because the razor can be a little rough on areas such as stretch marks and sensitive skin but works great for back and chest.</li>
    <li> worked as advertised, good product</li>
    <li> I had serious doubts about this product based on a number of reviews but I just finished using the Mangroomer and all my back hair is gone. Not a little, not patches removed - all of it.  I am really pleased and surprised. A very smooth result with my back looking like I had it shaved. Took all of 15 minutes to finish cleaning up my back and I finally look human again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product highly - could not be happier.</li>
    <li> The battery life is excellent.  I do not need to charge mine very often.  The adjustable arm is good.  The cut is pretty good.  It does cut very close but you may have to go over a places more than once.  It does not pinch or hurt.</li>
    <li> it work takes alttle getting use to but it leave your back looking much better than it did before for you used the shaver</li>
    <li> It sucks that I need this, but it works as expected.</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works better than I thought</li>
    <li> Definitely reaches those hard to reach place son your back.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> From one hairy guy to another, this thing works great!  If you have not shaved before, it takes a few for your skin to adjust.</li>
    <li> Does an OK job. Not for long hair on back. Use it when your is starting to grow out, if you don&#x27;t it will grab your hair and pull it.</li>
    <li> Love new design. Does a great job on the back. Better than the first model. I wish the battery would last longer though.Better that it recharges though.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much! This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought for my boyfriend and now his brother because it&#x27;s so great! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This thing works amazing! I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy and this cleans my back up right away! Very sturdy too.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works really well.</li>
    <li> This thing works great. Gets to places no problem,very sturdy and light weight.well worth the money spent and time looking.</li>
    <li> Good reach and easy to use</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have owned and it breaks about six months into using it. I will not buy again and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver for your back.  It is VERY IMPORTANT that you read the charging intructions carefully.  If you do not, the battery will not charge correctly.</li>
    <li> My second Mangroomer. I love this thing. If you have a hairy back, this is exactly what you need so stop looking and buy it. I suffered for years with this issue. After I got my first mangroomer, my back was bare inside of 7 minutes. I bought another one during an Amazon lightening deal so now I have a spare if ever needed.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well -- as long as you think of it as a disposable razor. I&#x27;ve purchased two, and each one died after about five uses.  And the battery does not recharge.</li>
    <li> Bought this so I could shave my 17 gerbils.  I was summer and I didn&#x27;t want them getting too hot.  I only got through shaving 9 of them before they formed a team, overpowered me and tied me up in my coat closet with twine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 8 months gerbils (9 shaved nicely and 8 unshaven) ran amok in my house destroying all plants and eating every grain product they could find.  During their time in charge, they even managed to put together a humble off-broadway production of Hamlet using some match sticks and crayons to build a set.  Finally their leader (Shamus) took pity and nibbled through the rope binding my legs.  I was able to run out onto the street and stop traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police report said that this was the 5th WORST gerbil incident they had ever seen and the worst since the Dukakas Gerbil Massacre of &#x27;88.  That&#x27;s saying really something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s almost summer again I plan to return to my house tomorrow and shave the remaining 8 gerbils.  Wish me luck.</li>
    <li> Ok yeah, I have a hairy back. I really wanted to be able to shave myself without help from the wife as it is pretty embarrassing. This did not do the job. I spent an hour trying to shave my back and basically made almost no headway. I don&#x27;t have a forest back there or anything, but this thing just barely worked at all. In the end I had to have my wife use it directly on my back making multiple passes until it was shaved. Skip this and just get a wax!</li>
    <li> Ever since junior high school I&#x27;ve tried covering up all of my excessive back hair. I feel so much better about myself after purchasing this product nearly eight months ago.&lt;br /&gt;The product is as described. I&#x27;ve had nothing break or go wrong at all. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Charging takes ages. After 2 hours of charging it lasted less than a minute. Seconds actually. The blades seem dull right off the bat. Hurts like mad to use this machine. Beware. If your sensitive to the touch stay away. Your gonna need tough skin to use this thing. Assuming you can get it to charge.</li>
    <li> This shaver does as advertised. Be warned though, it&#x27;s not the greatest for sensitive skin. If you&#x27;re not careful and shave at a bit of an angle it can cause irritation. The battery will die completely if you let it sit for too long. I purposely charged it overnight then used a week later and it was completely dead. Don&#x27;t let that deter you from the product. It&#x27;s a great product and I would still recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Mangroomer regularly for the past year and I am extremely impressed with it.  Using it as intended will not get the skin completely baby smooth, but that&#x27;s really not the point.  I have dark hair with fair skin and happy with the end results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some practice and a short learning curve, this is an extremely easy product to use.  The different contours of the human body, varying upper extremity flexibility, hair/skin color and mirror-guided dexterity will make everyone&#x27;s user experience a bit different, but the friends I have recommended this device to have had the same positive results.  It continues to trim nicely and still holds a good charge after many uses.  It is compact when folded, discrete and travels well.  No cuts or skin issues have been noted and the razor design is very safe, even if kids happened played with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good lighting, nice sized hand mirror and a broom are the only accessories needed to complete the task.  I takes about about 5 minutes to do the back, but it is time well spent.</li>
    <li> I had the original MG a few years back.  Got a lot of good use out of it.  Forgot it in a hotel room halfway across the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it.  Decided to buy the new and improved &#x27;professional&#x27; model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several improvements over the original device.  Love the fact that it is rechargeable!  Easier to hold and handle, more options for length.  Quite simply I could not even suggest any improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stand behind the product too.  I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems, but others who have had were taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trimming down with it, it makes me not despise my body hair so much.</li>
    <li> Used it once.  Not as easy to use as I thought.</li>
    <li> This product works as described. The technology is simple and straight forward.  You do have to go over you back several times to do a complete job.  Beats the alternative of waxing or having someone shave your back.  Especially helpful if you live alone.  I feel much better after I use it as I don&#x27;t like the hair that starting growing on my back once I reached 60./</li>
    <li> Not as easy as I thought it would be to use, but my range of motion in my shoulders are limited. I have only used once, will update in 6 months</li>
    <li> I order the Mangroomer as a gift for a friend and right out of the box it didnt work,  we tried to let it charge longer but it still wouldn&#x27;t power up unless you put pressure on a certain spot.  I sent it back for a exchange and the second unit i got seems to function well but still has issues turning and staying on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is still able to be used even though it has issues i give it 2 Stars.</li>
    <li> I initially liked it and it trims well .... but here is my main issue with it.  You can&#x27;t use it until you charge it and I end up needing to charge it every time I use it (typically every 1.5-2 months).  I basically have a 1 foot long MAN GROOMER billboard on my bathroom counter for however many hours it takes to charge plus however many days it takes me to remember to use it.   There is no place to discreetly charge this 1 foot long billboard.  I don&#x27;t care about the battery; I&#x27;m not going to take this camping.  Why not just make it something you can plug into a wall and use immediately?  Basically, I need to plan the night before so that I can keep it out long enough to charge.  And then, when I have people over, I realize that I forgot my MAN GROOMER billboard out.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time today and am very impressed.  Easy to use, gets the job done, and doesn&#x27;t snag or leave marks.  Spend a few extra bucks and get this rechargeable model.  Will it get you the exact same results as a professional?  No, but it&#x27;s still a bargain at twice the price.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Easy to use.  Extending handle makes it easy to get lower back.  Recommend not looking in a mirror while using the product.  It&#x27;s easier to look straight ahead.</li>
    <li> What a fantastic hair shaver !  I can shave my back and get it short. Much cooler to work without all that body hair.</li>
    <li> A awesome product it works great on any back areas that you cant reach and is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Spend the extra $ on this model.  Smooth trim, no scratches.</li>
    <li> Ok, so you&#x27;re shirtless on the beach and people keep asking you if you&#x27;re hot in that angora sweater. You walk down the street with your shirt off and children either throw fruit at you or scream and run in the opposite direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body hair it seems has been bannished and Man Grooming the rage. I thought it seemed an innovative item well designed to mow down the back 40 but it may take some getting used to.The blades are far from razor sharp but then every electric razor takes time to break in. I have used the groomer twice and experianced some pulling and the results not as effective as hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a rep from the company was kind enough to respond to my review and raise a number of valid points. Not the least of which being both your skin, and length of wolly mammoth hair all play a factor in breaking in this innovative groomer. In my case the hair itself is sparse and fine but the groomer will still take time to get used too. I&#x27;m a head shaver as well and a die hard wet shaving fanatic for years. I use and collect Straight Razors and DE razors. When I don&#x27;t have the time for the indulgence of an old fashioned wet shave - I turn toan electric, either my Braun or Norelco. So I suppose you can say I take shavingbe it face, head and now back seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction after the initial use was that the groomer was ineffective. But this had more to do with my lack of technique and learning curve than the groomer itself.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I can shave my own back.  I also like the fact that it is rechargeable.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and provides a good, clean and smooth cut. I would definitely recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Shaves your nasty ass back hair, takes just a bit longer than shaving your face. You have back hair? You want it gone, boom its done, you dont need to read more.</li>
    <li> For hairy men works real good, ease of use with the extension helps reach areas that I couldn&#x27;t with other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Okay, so if you need a product like this - and I do, this is great, nice that it is rechargeable this time (the first one was battery powered).  great idea, and great product.</li>
    <li> great fro back hair removal.</li>
    <li> I bought the pro mangroomer from another store because it was a little cheaper. Within 10 minutes of using I was completely smooth. Back and beyond. It gets nice and close, but don&#x27;t press too hard are it will leave red marks and irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> Groomer seemed to be the best thing ever... After about 3 months ( at 1x use per week) the groomer stopped working and only provides a 30 day warranty. Great concept and design but poor quality.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing since &#x27;sliced bread&#x27; for men who have a difficult time reaching certain portions of their back. I would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking at this product, more than likely you&#x27;ve been searching for a way to get rid of back hair. Well, you&#x27;ve found a great option, I&#x27;ve had this for about 2-3 weeks and it works as advertised. Yes, I have a very hairy back, both on the upper and lower sections, it was quite long to, no shorter than 1-2 inches and this cut through it with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that this will not be as close a shave as a regular razor, but it does cut down very close, close enough to not be noticed. It will leave your back with a stubbly feeling though, and the first time you put on a shirt it will feel very weird. You will get used to it though. In my opinion it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing worth mentioning is that it is quite loud, louder than your average electric shaver.</li>
    <li> ...with no one to shave it for you?  This is the product for you! With a little practice (maybe by the third time/attempt) you&#x27;ll get the hang of it and produce great results.  I&#x27;ve tried other back shavers but they were too messy/awkward to use (with the shaving cream and all)and they left cuts and nicks just like shaving your face. The ManGroomer leaves your back a little red with some mild red streaks...that both fade real quickly...it does not draw blood. I suggest that one shaves his (or her!) back just prior to taking a shower. The little hairs tend to be itchy!  Anyway...Great Product!!</li>
    <li> Somewhat skeptical but after putting the trimmer in service I happy with the product. Couple of minutes learning curve and the performance was as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works great! Easy to use and gets to hard to reach locations on my back.</li>
    <li> The product gets the job done, but the motor is loud. I removed the bottom part of the extension handle, as the product is more effective without it.</li>
    <li> I have 2 of these in different apartments. If you&#x27;re a guy with a hairy back like me, they&#x27;re great for keeping it smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Dad who just might be the missing link but this groomer seems to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I used it twice with pretty decent results but I had an issue with maintaining the flat head attached to the body. On the third use the head came off and could never be reassembled.  Perhaps I am thinking about another product but I seem to recall that the product came with an insert setting forth that an extended warranty was included with it at no extra cost. Do any of you have the information. Maybe it is time to return the razor.    Thanks.    +++++UPDATE+++++ February 4, 2015    The very next day following my review, the MANGROOMER directly contacted me.  The purpose of the email was to express their own disappointment in my poor experience. They actually seemed to care about this customer; with the number of 4 and 5 star reviews I guess they could have easily ignored me, not to mention that I was bringing the problem to their attention years later.  By way of some other reviews regarding the head falling off, I think there is either an intermittent manufacturing problem that does occur from time to time OR their instructional manual may be deficient in instructing how to reinstall the head.     I have no way of knowing which is the case, however, I have never seen a response as positive as theirs making me whole again. In fact, after writing my review of the Professional model I saw they had an Ultimate model which I know seems to be similar in design based on reviews. But there were hundreds of reviewers running 4 to 5 stars so I BOUGHT THEIR NEWER ULTIMATE MODEL. It was the next day that they offered me a complete replacement of the Professional! Since I already ordered the Ultimate, instead of replacement I asked for a few supplies for the Ultimate as there was no sense in having two new shavers. It may have been only hours later when they went even above and beyond my request. When I receive the Ultimate along with the accessories I requested plus an extra one that I did not request, I will review the Ultimate.    I guess no manufactured item off the lineis always perfect, but all you can ask for is a manufacturer like this that is responsive making it essentially a no hassle experience. As an early user of the Internet, and a very frequent online consumer, I would like to give a shout out to our new form of marketing and communication.  Without the Internet this transaction would never have happened in the way described. There would be only a one customer marketing advantage to doing the right thing (or, more than right). The only problem is that some sellers still don&#x27;t take advantage of its power and rue the day that a consumer had easy means of complaining and doing so on a big soap box. Sellers have and will eventually learn that actions such as these by Mangroomer (e.g., and selling sneakers with a prepaid return bag) will buy them lifelong customers that will greatly exceed the profit loss on the one unit of replaced.    Thanks, Mangroomer.    Charles M. Levy, Esq.</li>
    <li> This thing literally fell apart after only one use. A little plastic piece broke inside cutter and the cutter head came apart. Can&#x27;t put it back together because the broken tiny bit of plastic held a spring in place whick held the blades.</li>
    <li> The battery lasted about a minute after a full charge. The product was new right out if the box and I really had high hopes for it. You can tell it is very cheaply made. Lots of potential on this one... If they had a better quality product they would probably sell like hot cakes. Don&#x27;t waste your time because even if the one you get isn&#x27;t defective I can guarantee it won&#x27;t last the long haul.</li>
    <li> After a divorce, I had no one to clean up hair that had begun to grow on my back, (which I didn&#x27;t want and presumably no one else would appreciate either).  I searched and found this MANGROOMER which had a number of positive reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  It works well and removes the hair.  I just do a 5 minute touch up once a week to keep my back clean just using a handheld mirror while standing in front of a bathroom mirror so that I can see what I&#x27;m doing.  Initially, there are a few red marks but they fade quickly.  About the only complaint would be the battery which is an old school rechargeable, meaning you need to let it discharge completely before recharging, or you risk the battery gradually losing its charging capacity.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of these products, but it worked well, seems pretty sturdy and is a definite upgrade over the standard designed razors and shavers. Allowed me to reach everywhere easily.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband who always is making me shave his back and even when I like to do it he will preffer do it himself, he works overseas and there is nobody who can do this, I bought the product so he could shave his back by himself but, I did not realize will not work in another countries because the electricity voltage is not the same?? was not with bateries :( anyways my husband tryed at home and it was kind of dificult, it shaves like the 50% but not a good shaving and some parts of his skin back were read and with some scratchs, so I guess you have to do it everyday so you gane experience...for me, mmm, I keep shaving my husband&#x27;s back ;)</li>
    <li> If you have ever shaved before don&#x27;t expect to be happy with the Mangroomer. It&#x27;s not a shaver at all, it&#x27;s a trimmer and only gets as close as about a 2 day beard. It would not even trim down body hair after 3 days of growing, maybe it&#x27;s good for the once and a while groomer but if you like to keep smooth this will never do it. It should be an electric foil shaver on the end of the arm.</li>
    <li> This thing really works. I have tried other body groomers before and none work like this one. It shaves very quickly and cleanly. The only problem I have had is the battery can run down pretty quick sometimes. It definitely needs to be fully charged to last for a full back shave.</li>
    <li> Not the highest quality but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Not sure if the one I got was just defective or what but it is horrible. Won&#x27;t cut any hair. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Excelente producto. recomendable</li>
    <li> but not the smaller ones. your better off having someone use a norelco body groom on you from behind. also, this mangroomer can scratch the hell out of you if u dont do it right.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because positive reviews outweighed the negative ones (although there are several negative ones).  I don&#x27;t have that much back hair.  I have some light, but unsightly patches on my lats, and light fur on my upper middle back.  From the moment you open it, you&#x27;ll be disappointed by the cheap construction.  But you hope that it&#x27;ll do the job.  Well, I was able to shave the light patches of hair on my lats very well, but it couldn&#x27;t do the job on my upper back.  And then, one day, after only my second use, it completely crapped out and stopped working altogether.  Plenty other reviews say the same, and that&#x27;s exactly the experience that I had.  Don&#x27;t purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This thing is a life saver!!!  If you have hair on your back you can braid, you will need to use a regular buzzer first.  But, I keep up with this every 2-3 weeks and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> Certain times of the year like when it is hot, I like to remove body hair from my chest/stomach area and back.Similarly...when the body hair gets too thick as well.Getting access to the chest/stomach area is no problem--I just plug in my basic Wahl Brand electric trimmer (without any length guides attached) and I go for it.Getting access to my over abundance of back hair is another issue.The &amp;#34;image&amp;#34; of the Mangroomer 211-6 Professional Back Hair Remover shown in the amazon.com ad does NOT do the product justice;however,as the lower &amp;#34;arm&amp;#34; of the tool actually expands incrementally to a much longer length.Although the user manual states that the angle extends to 130+ degrees,it actually gives you the best access to shaving your back hair.While operating, it is a little louder than I expected,but it aggressively removes even relatively thick growths of hair.When attempting to open the package,try cutting carefully with a sharp razor knife (Be careful!) along the outer edges of the clear plastic area and then you can use the original packaging and box to store it.The instructions indicate to charge it for 18 to 24 hours on the initial charge for the benefit of extended battery life.Purchase a handheld mirror and have another larger mirror behind you to make the job turn out better.I am not a &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; person,but I can imagine that if I had to go to one to have my back hair removed,it would probably run into a lot more money and I can use this tool over and over.I purchased an extra replacement head for the future if I should need it.I experienced absolutely no painful pulling of the hair at all.The instructions say, to avoid ingrown hairs,go in the opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>
    <li> Ouch!! This thing does not cut hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not a powerful motor or sharp blades.&lt;br /&gt;The blades are so dull they got stuck in my back hair! This was on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;Also the arm doesn&#x27;t straighten.&lt;br /&gt;Great idea but whoever made this clearly doesn&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and tape a electric razor (that actually cuts) to a short stick for better results.</li>
    <li> I like it becuase it does do my back as it was described to do..the blades need to be more durable</li>
    <li> Where has this been my entire adult life? This works great and has plenty of power.</li>
    <li> Good product but horrible build quality.  I had two that went defective.  Buy with caution.  I hope the manufacturer addresses these concerns since there is no other product like this on the market.</li>
    <li> As title says... works great, better than any other option my husband has tried. We&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months and he uses it weekly but the same issue happens each time he purchases it, just becomes less and less effective till finally we just throw it out and have to buy another.. wish there was a trade in offer or some longer warranty!</li>
    <li> It works pretty much as described.  The reach is sufficient for all areas of back. You just need to be a bit careful as I have cut my back a few times usually in the shoulder blade area.  Overall it is a good product.  The charge lasts for several days with about 10 minutes usage a day. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great product! Easy to get the hard places on the back with the extender arm. Battery lasts a very long time in between charges. Highly recommended for those looking to manscape (back and chest).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband with hesitation.  It is awesome.  He loves it and says it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> It works really well. The extending and unfolding handle makes it reach to reach every inch of your back. It&#x27;s designed to trim away all the hair. I would not suggest this for more sensitive areas, and it&#x27;s not designed to leave shorten hair to a desired length but to get rid of it. If you want to trim hair on the front of the body, including the sensitive areas, use the Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro [[ASIN:B0037HP9OA Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro]]</li>
    <li> Great - a groomer that can reach those awkward places in the middle of the back that otherwise get missed.  Gone is taping my beard trimmer to a ruler to try and reach.  Now a nice smooth back all over.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better buys I&#x27;ve made. The tool really works and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> First off I had my doubts about this shaver or better yet the spectacular name \\&quot;Mangroomer\\&quot;. But it works and it works well. It does take a little getting use to but if you use it like a back scratcher it does a fantastic job. My back is very thinly fuzzy as an ex girlfriend said but this trims it smooth. Just make sure you have a clean up plan in place because you will see the results on the floor of all the hair it will trim. Also you do not have to press hard against your skin - just glide it gently and you will see the results and it does not leave any scratches or red marks. Well best wishes to the rest of the world who may not be afraid to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely give 5 stars but this product is worth it. Only downside is that is is noisy but it sounds a little louder than an electric razor. But if you want hair off your back then get this. My Mangroomer had oil spots on it like it was used before but I cleaned it up with an antiseptic hand cleaner and I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your options are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Back wax (ouch)&lt;br /&gt;2. Have your neighborhood barber shave your back or girlfriend&lt;br /&gt;3. Get this product and learn how to use it and love your back without hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping mine - hope it lasts as long as I will.</li>
    <li> This is a must have for any guy with back hair! VERY happy with quality of product, and it works!</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was the answer to my prayers, but after the first use it won&#x27;t hold a charge and pulls as much as it cuts. The idea is great but the product is not very good. It is better than nothing though. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> works well, easy to shave in difficult to reach areas.</li>
    <li> The design of this shaver is brilliant but The blade of this shaver is in poor quality and does not shave well at all. I returned it.</li>
    <li> When I first received the MANGROOMER it would not turn on but I took the blade head off like the instructions instruct you to do for cleaning and when I put it back on it worked great! I have had no problems with it sense. What a great idea and makes trimming the whole back very easy to do by yourself. I love this thing!</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Works well.  Now I don&#x27;t have to ask my girlfriend to shave my disgusting back hair hahaha.</li>
    <li> works great actually, battery doesn&#x27;t last for s*** though</li>
    <li> Takes some getting used to, and oddly loud compared to other trimmers.  Definitly takes some getting used to as you have to use it at odd angles.  I wish I bought the higher model with the articulating head as I think that&#x27;d make it much easier.  Scratched the heck out of my back several tries in, but it is nice to not have to ask the wife for grooming assistance.</li>
    <li> I just put this thing in the trash after owning it for about a year. what a POS. it barely cuts chest hair and hurts when using it on my back as its meant. always have to follow up with another trimmer.  dont try to save money and buy this thing cuz you are gonna buy twice.</li>
    <li> This product works great and is everything it says to be. It is great for touchups on your back</li>
    <li> I have the older model that requires batteries so I figured I would upgrade.  The unit performs great but it cannot hold a charge.  I charge the unit and then store it for future use, maybe 2 to 3 weeks later. I go to use it and it is totally dead. Then I have to wait to charge the unit again. I like the unit but wish the charge would hold longer. Maybe my unit is defective.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performs very nice though</li>
    <li> I love it I use it every 3 days</li>
    <li> The shaver itself works great when it&#x27;s charged, however it does NOT hold a charge between uses so you need to charge it every time prior to use.  I cannot find any customer contact information to request an exchange.</li>
    <li> The mangroomer performs perfectly. Purchase this product if you want to control when it needs to be used. Highly recommend.  Bob G.</li>
    <li> Very nice to have but not significantly different than the basic model.  Would rec the basic for the money difference</li>
    <li> works great, awkward at first till you learn how to use it.but then dose a good job!</li>
    <li> My husband bought it to &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; his back and he was happy with the result.  It does a good job to clear the hair and it seems to last his repeat use so far.</li>
    <li> Does a very good job.</li>
    <li> At least where I don&#x27;t want it.  This does a good job of removing the hair on my back in places impossible to reach otherwise.  Now there is no need to get anyone else involved, and I like that a lot.  A good, quality product that I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  The charger doesn&#x27;t seem matched properly to the battery - I only got decent performance and charge life when I disassembled it and charged the battery using my more professional charger that I use for RC helicopter batteries. (obviously not what you want to have to do to charge a shaver) Beyond that, even when it&#x27;s running zippy on a good charge the blades don&#x27;t seem to be very effective. Hand your girlfriend your beard trimmer or a razor and let her give you the smooth back that she wants.</li>
    <li> I love this groomer because it reaches hard to get places and keeps my back well shaven and smooth.</li>
    <li> Original was good this one is great. Charging is convenient blades run smooth. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 6 weeks now and love it! I dont have alot of hair on my back but just enough to be ugly. This groomer makes quick work of it, a little akward at first but gets easier the more you use it. Beats the hell out of asking the wife to do it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highest rating</li>
    <li> Im glad I bought it. After years of shaving my back, taking 30 minutes or longer...I decided to give this a try. The long handle is great and it cuts pretty damn close...you would need a razor to get any shorter. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I had the original model for a couple years and loved it. It worked very well for me up until it wore too much and broke. I ordered this new pro model without even thinking about it because I liked the old one so much. This this is absolutely terrible. It is HARDLY cutting hair, but does a FANTASTIC job at just pulling on it (pulling on back hair doesn&#x27;t feel very good, in case you were wondering). I don&#x27;t know where they went wrong, but Im really mad I just spent 40 dollars on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I was contacted promptly by the Mangroomer sales team and they shipped me a new shaver free of charge to allow me to give them another chance, in hopes I had a defective piece. I am still waiting to receive the new one (its only been a day) and if I deem it to work better than the first one I purchased I will remove this review. Id like you thank the sales team for their promptness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mangroomer pro for about a year.  Once a week is good enough for me.  Well built, works great, and I get about 4-5 uses before it requires a recharge.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Wish I had bought it sooner.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Trims back hair, and all body hair, very well.</li>
    <li> i bought 1 of these for my mother-in-law. After 3 recharges she was able to shave over 50% of her back hair off. Her self esteem is so much better that she has vowed to lose 75lbs. She can&#x27;t wait to sit around the Doughboy in front of her double wide this Summer. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/8/16 Update - I am pleased to announce that my mother-in-law was able to lose over 75lbs, eventually trim her back hair (although she has to do daily maintenance), and even trim her unibrow.&lt;br /&gt;While sitting in the Doughboy in the front her  trailer  this summer, a billionaire took notice, asked her out, and they are now married.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me I am no longer married to her daughter. I noticed a large uncontrollable patch of hair sprouting on her back @ 25, and realized the life long task that would be to come.......</li>
    <li> Used it several times since its initial battery charge and it works great. Being genetically cursed with a hairy back and having tried several electric razors, this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> It works.  The battery isn&#x27;t the greatest for holding a charge, but it beats bending my arms 7 ways.  This last sentence is because one more word was required.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of the Mangroomer.  This product will cut through a lot of body hair.  Initially I used it slowly, getting used to the way it worked but now, when used on a regular basis, it is fast and easy.  Would highly recommend to anyone with a lot of body hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, I get those random pesky hairs that seem to sprout for no good reason and this product def gets the job done. It holds its charge for a long time! and it doesnt feel like its scraping my skin.</li>
    <li> rips the hair off your back so painfull.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time, and the charge holds very well. I wish I would have bought it sooner then I did.</li>
    <li> Great item. Not only does the back and back-side properly, but is better to use on your more... delicate areas due to the shortness of the blade. Had mine for a while now and still chews through the brush like it was new. I highly recommend this to my fellow man.</li>
    <li> now can get all the back hair off by himself what a wonderful product will recommend this so glad to have buy this</li>
    <li> Made well !!! It has a great reaching ability for your back..Good shaver close shave but could be a little closer b+</li>
    <li> The electric version rocks. I had the battery powered version for a few years and eventually got tired of replacing or recharging batteries. The only thing I&#x27;d improve on this is some kind of locking mechanism so the arm doesn&#x27;t switch to another angle when you&#x27;re using it. But it&#x27;s not a huge deal, just something I figured they would&#x27;ve come up with by now.</li>
    <li> My wife has been complaining about my hairy back for 35 years.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this product after reading an article. In a few short&lt;br /&gt;minutes my hairy back was gone. A miracle product.</li>
    <li> It was close to I&#x27;d say 8 months since my back and chest had been shaved and I was kinda sceptical about how it might do.&lt;br /&gt;But to be honest with you it did a great job with hardly any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone else.</li>
    <li> died after a few uses ... would not charge</li>
    <li> Still going strong after years of use!  My only suggestion would be to make the joints a little stiffer so it doesn&#x27;t unfold when using on your back.</li>
    <li> works better than my original mangroomer and I love that I no longer have to feed AA batteries into it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother. Trying to use anything on the back is always a challenge, and this product is no different. Just have someone else shave your back for you.</li>
    <li> This revised man-groomer is better than the first generation. The recharge on this lasts for a long time. Great product. I have used since 2005.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave very well, I have to run over the same spot over and over and over, which hurts after awhile and makes my back all red. I don&#x27;t regret buying it, hope they perfect it though. It makes a horrible loud sound btw.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife, who is remarkably hairy for a woman.  It worked wonders on her hairy back, face and knuckles, but she is a bit stubbly after. She did keep her sideburns.  I do, however, find it a bit sexist and assuming to call it the &amp;#34;Mangroomer.&amp;#34;  I mean really, I find nothing more offensive than challenging my hairsuite spouse&#x27;s femininity by forcing her to use a product that people might just assume is intended for a man because of its insensitive title.</li>
    <li> Thought it was pretty easy to use. With it cut a little smoother.</li>
    <li> Cut myself cough cough</li>
    <li> Love this thing.  No more will I use a razer clenched in a pair of vice grips.  No more will I use a short &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; tool that&#x27;s too short to reach half of my back and requires Cirque de Soleil like flexibility to get to.  No more will I smell like a chemical Nair plant while trying to make it easier to remove the forest of hair that grows everywhere it shouldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, your back won&#x27;t be smooth, but it&#x27;ll be good enough so that when you take your shirt off at a public pool the kids won&#x27;t go running and people won&#x27;t run to get their camera so they can snap pictures of the sasquatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it six or seven times now without having to recharge it.  It seems like it has a solid construction, though I&#x27;m betting the pivot point will give out sooner than later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has plenty of power and isn&#x27;t too noisy.  It has cut my grooming time in half given the larger size of the cutting head on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I just wish I&#x27;d bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> Does a great job once you get used to it doing the opposite of what you might expect behind your back. Just wish the battery lasted a little longer.</li>
    <li> great, cuts good and extension helps alotr</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but this thing really works.  The hardest thing so far is mastering the different angles so you cut all the areas you are targeting.  I didn&#x27;t suffer from any scraping or chafing from using this.</li>
    <li> my husband uses it for his back. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Works OK. Does not take all the hair off.  Still need to shave.</li>
    <li> Biggest complaint is the 135degree angle limitation-not sure what they were thinking...180 would have been so much better, and less like to snap in half&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only reason it has good reviews is because people have nothing to compare it to, since they have a patent and no1 wants to shell out the cash to produce their own similar product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;other than that, it seems to work well...kind of difficult to maneuver with the 135degree bend...it does make your back all red and scratched up, but that is temporary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cheaper battery powered option may be better b/c it is cheaper...only reason i got this is because is rechargeable</li>
    <li> Works Great ! My Lady Friend likes it to, now she does not have to shave my back!&lt;br /&gt;Trims hair really close and does not leave any razor burns.</li>
    <li> I received this finally in the mail and got to try it out. It takes a little practice to do side by side strokes, but eventually when you get that method down this thing is a godsend! I was born with Viking Blood so I am prone to having body hair. There is nothing wrong with having body hair, but certain parts of your body should not have hair like your back. Fellow wookies and wolf-men will be happy they purchased this item.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the reviews and while it was a little on the pricey side, the motor is strong and the device doesn&#x27;t pinch. I&#x27;m not robin williams hairy but it&#x27;s enough to make you think twice about going shirtless. The trimmer did what it is supposed to. Hair kind of falls away in clumps so I guess it&#x27;s easier to clean up after. I used bathroom mirror combined with a cheap door hanging mirror for best results. Trims hair pretty short, makes your back kind of feel like the male/loop side of velcro. So it&#x27;s not baby-smooth but it works fine. Tends to grab your shirt and towels. it&#x27;s just a little weird at first. Not much of a bad thing, really. Makes it easy to dry off after showers and looks much better with the back hair trimmed. Can&#x27;t comment on the durability at this time as i&#x27;ve only used it once but so far so good. It does have a good grip texture. Definitely not cheap slick plastic. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Works as advertized! Good back scratcher too!</li>
    <li> I order this item arrive on time I open and was fully charge so no need charge at first time so i use it as soon arrive works great shave my back hair clean I like this item.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two. I have returned two. Folks, don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this particular brand. You get what you pay for!!! Cheap!!!</li>
    <li> I have been asking for this item from Santa for a few years now and finally received this year. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product it is exactly as advertised!</li>
    <li> I previously had the regular version.  I had no problems with it and thought it worked well, but I wanted to try the professional one.  The professional one feels a little sturdier, and the fact that it is rechargeable is great.  If you want to spend the extra money, I &#x27;d say go for the professional version instead of the regular one.</li>
    <li> A charge last for a long time and it seems to have greater potency than the standard Mangroomer. The on/off switch lacks a locking mechanism that would make it safe for travel.</li>
    <li> Its a fine trimmer. After im done, it looks like ive just waxed my back. Used it only a few times, but its holding up good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no longer that hairy guy on the beach :)  This product works very well and holds an charge better than I expected.  The large blade allows you to complete your grooming in a timely manner.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have had these for a week now, used them twice. They are good.  Read the review of the guy who tells you how to use them on &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; and be patient.  Allow 15 minutes and it worked for me.  My wife, my normal groomer for the beach, was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wireless aspect is good, this job is hard enough without wrestling with a wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little thing.  Given the job we are doing with these, reaching behind our heads to groom our back, a wrist strap should be an essential detail.  I wonder how this thing will survive a drop onto a tile floor.  Or several of them over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy, glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> This doesnt cut any closer or better than any other electric shaver/trimmer. The only benefit is it allows you to do it yourself which is a GREAT BENEFIT. Still leaves sandpaper stubble. If you go over the same spot a few times it will irritate the skin and doesnt get any smoother. Motor is powerful. Would be 3 stars but gave 4 for the D-I-Y aspect.</li>
    <li> I really like this unit because it makes it possible to groom in places that are hard to reach when I don&#x27;t have someone to help me</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a broken down non pro version (which worked well for a few years but got dull).  Powerful, comfortable, even came with a charge. Will buy again when my hairy ape back dulls this one in a few years. Do buy the pro version.</li>
    <li> Although this shaver does not result in a perfectly \\&quot;baby smooth\\&quot; shave, it does make the shave of a hairy man&#x27;s back pretty complete, and very importantly, it does not scrape or nick the \\&quot;shavee\\&quot; in the process (which can result in painful bleeding and lingering red marks in my own experience). This is a problem I&#x27;ve encountered particularly with face/beard trimmers, etc. The Mangroomer is very well shielded from \\&quot;wounding\\&quot; the user. So I&#x27;m happy with the results! The extensions and adjustability of the shaver are great advantages. If one wants a \\&quot;baby smooth\\&quot; shave, this device definitely prepares the back for the easiest follow-up use of a razor - otherwise, the razor would get clogged and injury is more likely. In short, I love this product and recommend it to any of us men who happen to have back hair that we don&#x27;t want!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t do a search for something like this years ago.  It is awesome.  It works just as expected.  Only slight drawback is that it is loud as hell.  But don&#x27;t let that deter you, it works great.</li>
</ol>
