      <li>I&#x27;m going to be very honest here.</li>
      <li>He is very warm hearted once he is approched.</li>
      <li>That night was awesome and we have gone out 2 more times since and each time has been blast.</li>
      <li>This stuff works too good, stay away, if you value your sanity.</li>
      <li>Any review that has something good to say about the product get nothing but up votes.</li>
      <li>liar don&#x27;t work .no good product.</li>
      <li>but no, it were the good reviews which are damaging our wallets because this thing does not do what it suppose to do, attract women.</li>
      <li>Good luck on your journey all.</li>
      <li>I did have a couple of good times</li>
      <li>Go some where else and good luck.</li>
      <li>Good expirience</li>
      <li>For this price you can get a good cologne.</li>
      <li>I have been using Arouse-Rx for 4 years now with mostly good results.</li>
      <li>Yes it makes women attracted, however I found that some women are good at hiding how attracted they are.</li>
      <li>im think all this good reviews are fakes .save</li>
      <li>The unscented pheremone is a good tool to have when you want to do a good job picking up the ladies.</li>
      <li>We talked for a good hour or so</li>
      <li>Also, layer it with a good cologne nothing too overbearing though.</li>
      <li>Now as I said I am a good looking guy</li>
      <li>Does not even work as a good moisturizer, let alone what it&#x27;s intended for.  </li>
      <li>Might as well save your money or purchase a good cologne.</li>
      <li>They worked really good.</li>
      <li>Save your money and buy a good perfume.</li>
      <li>After the conversation was over,she INVITED me to follow her to her car (NOW ALL THE GUYS WHERE JEALOUS AND AMAZED),we disappeared for a good 20 minutes or so.    </li>
      <li>Very good, very like, send some loathe to give up&lt;br /&gt;Support, as always, very good</li>
      <li>Both of them got me VERY INTERESTING results, but the Pher-X had a smell that didn&#x27;t mix well with my cologne.  </li>
      <li>Appears to make me more attractive to some women.  </li>
      <li>No product is going to make you more attractive to women.  </li>
      <li>And once they turn their attention to me, the ladies will be very satisfied with what I have to offer.</li>
      <li>lol, this stuff is a joke, but i do know there are real genuine pheromones out there, but this sure is not one of them.</li>
      <li>I knew if I got them in the hot tub it would be ON!!!!</li>
      <li>good, very like, send some loathe to give up&lt;br /&gt;Support, as always, very good</li>
      <li>pheromone definitly worked for me amazingly well.</li>
      <li>Plus the reviews are amazing.</li>
      <li>Apply to points of your body that sweat and DO NOT rub it in( kind of like applying cologne) all that does is kill the lifespan.</li>
      <li>NONE of them liked the smell.</li>
      <li>and I keep catching women staring when I look in the mirrors.</li>
      <li>was nice talking to you&amp;#34; or something like that.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to be as effective as promoted.  </li>
      <li>and then kind of forgot about pheromones.</li>
      <li>now i just need to find a girl of my own.</li>
      <li>On the bus, as I walk to the rear of the bus to take a seat, women would look at me, hand-comb their hair, adjust their clothes to assure they are tidy or presentable.</li>
      <li>(she approached me) a nice lady.</li>
      <li>well I honestly don&#x27;t know how to tell if it works.....</li>
      <li>they claim that girls will attract.&lt;br /&gt;It was not even at all noticed by my own girl friend..</li>
      <li>So guys, rely on your own charm, it worked for me and there should be no reason why it should not work for you.</li>
      <li>I even noticed my own boss showing signes of attraction.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I had no idea</li>
      <li>So, take note when you use it try to take into account that you are adding something to what your own body chemistry already makes.</li>
      <li>It is your belief in this product that is making you more confident and, I imagine, more attractive.  </li>
      <li>Honestly if this stuff worked they wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep it in stock.  </li>
      <li>It works more effectively on some people as I observed.</li>
      <li>i did better with my own skills of words</li>
      <li>honestly, women pay more attention when I have it on than when i don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>My best experience so far has been with Chikara Cologne for men.</li>
      <li>the shipping had problem to arrive, but the rest was good, on the right package, good accomodation, the product is pretty much good, but i still waiting for the effect.</li>
      <li>Man, I thought this was too good to be true and</li>
      <li>Like I said before application is very important.</li>
      <li>Granted, he&#x27;s a pretty good looking dude with a nice car...</li>
      <li>I guess is a good social blender to be around womens.. very nice..  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be clear, I&#x27;m very good with girls, but with this, most of the work is off my shoulders.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is so lame, it so does not work, save your money and be wise, i even gave it to couple of my friends to test it, it did not too anything, women could hardly even notice lol, this stuff is a joke, but i do know there are real genuine pheromones out there, but this sure is not one of them.</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS! I&#x27;m a mailman and I am getting so many smiles from women of all ages while walking my routes. In the office every female co worker is noticing me, and on the street walking my route...walking into businesses, the looks and full teeth smiles I&#x27;m getting are unbelievable. I liked this product so much I bought 2 more bottles!. If you are a man and you like women.....you NEED this stuff!</li>
    <li> This stuff WORKS.... I took notes for when I used it and when I didn&#x27;t, and cannot believe the difference in the results. The ladies never know what hit &#x27;em...lol.. It does work as advertised. Just use it sparingly, but be ready....</li>
    <li> It does not work...to me another snake oil in better package. I tried in several occasions, each time nothing really happened. People should avoid this snake oil.</li>
    <li> The only thing that product grabs to me was a bunch of flies and mosquitoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product after i read a bit about the pheromones, i thought it will be a real thing but it turned out to be a fake thing.&lt;br /&gt;Just an oily drops that doesn&#x27;t really do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch our guys, i was tricked by the fake reviews on that product, apparently someone is paying those guys money to say it is a working thing ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money! I wish I could rate zero star for such a garbage.</li>
    <li> The last time I tried some pheromones all it did was leave some greasy stains on my clothes and had an odor to it. I was leery of trying it again, but I read some of the reviews here and decided to risk it. Boy am I glad I did. A couple of girls in my office building seem to stand closer to me in the elevator and at lunch in the food court one of them asked if they could eat with me.  I really like the attention I am getting and I&#x27;ve even gotten up the nerve to ask her out on a date.  She said yes!! I plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> After reading all these reviews, I thought this must all be a joke. So I did my research, read the message boards and articles and found out that for many people, pheromones can really work.  We have something in our nose called a vomeronasal organ that can pick up pheros.  It really exists!!!  So I purchased this stuff as well as Pher-X.  Both of them got me VERY INTERESTING results, but the Pher-X had a smell that didn&#x27;t mix well with my cologne.  For now, I will leave 4 stars until I actually close the deal with this hottie in my statistics class.</li>
    <li> I am really happy I gave this a chance. When I came back home for the holidays I put some one and hit the local watering hole where I ran into some old classmates. One of the hotter chicks that I always wanted to get with was there. Long story short, we had our own reunion ;-) Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still riding the high from last night&#x27;s adventure. Got my order of Arouse-Rx in the post and hit the club. I infiltrated a table of 4 beautiful women and opened the door for the rest of my crew to come in and scoop up my leftovers. My friends all wanna know where I got this stuff from, not sure if I&#x27;m gonna let them know just yet.</li>
    <li> Does Not Work - Tested with Many People and all feel it is not good. There are products that work, This is not one of them</li>
    <li> Had several women smell this crap, even handed around the bottle to them so they could smell it. NONE of them liked the smell. Total garbage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to pheromones, but I do know they should have some sort of odor to them. This product has little to no odor and it seems to be just glorified Vegetable oil. I have been using NPA with some results, but thought I would try something else to see if I could improve any more. Looks like I tried the wrong product. No effect, the oil is very sticky, no results. Save yourself some money and try a different one- probably any other one would be better- or don&#x27;t buy any at all. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how effective pheromones really are, but like I said, the NPA at least had some results.</li>
    <li> Well I will keep this short and sweet.  I just got my order the other day and decided to try it out at work and around a few female friends.  All I can say is that this stuff works.  It&#x27;s the strangest thing too cause it just looks like a simple oil and has no color or odor!  BUT IT WORKS.    I started by heading back to work where there are several females that I talk to on a normal bases.  But however they were just excessive chatty when I had came back.  Also several of them would wonder aimlessly around my area and stop to make small chat whenever possible.  But it&#x27;s work and I know better than that.  So later in the evening several friends started showing up. One in which I have had a crush on for a while.  Normally she usually will just say hello and move on about, but not today.  She too was extremely chatty and was way more playful. In the fact that she just couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off of me.  So all I can say is that this works and I don&#x27;t know how, cause I am still skeptical, that&#x27;s the only reason for 4 stars and not 5.</li>
    <li> I thinks this is some type of money making scam. I got trapped in this scam, this product doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for last 20 days three times a day according to the instructions but not getting any results.Also, I think this product has repulsive effect than what they say it is made for. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I came on here to buy more just because I dont want to be in a position where im running low and need to wait for shipping. I think I am a good looking man and when I go out, I try to go HARD. From clothing, to grooming, to social dynamics, to my bed game I dont mess around. So thats alittle about me and the reason I went with this product..all around effectiveness.    Heres my experience. I was in a loud club lots of people. I was looking fresh as usual with my big smile looking friendly. while I was waiting for my friend to buy a drink a girl from about 7 feet stood there and probably had a few drinks before. She was staring at me like she just saw a ghost. Her stare was so hard I actually thought she was trying to communicate with a friend or person standing next to me. Now as I said I am a good looking guy but I live in germany and with this dating culture, women expect men to go up to them but maybe 1x a year I get a girl who comes to me. She walked straight up to me like a force field was pulling her in. She was extremlly nervous but something made her come. I ended that night with her number. I dont know if it was a coincidence for me to put RX on and this girl melt in my hand but or not but I like to believe maybe it helped. So with all that into condiseration it couldnt hurt to buy another bottle. I hope this review helps. I gave it 4 stars because I guess im still in the trial period with it.</li>
    <li> This Is one hell of a product I must say!!! It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34; drop her panties in a heartbeat&amp;#34; potion or anything but this really goes get you in their radar!!! Great for parties and breaking the ice.</li>
    <li> This is best pheromone product on the market. There&#x27;s a reason why this is #1 on Amazon. You no longer have to look like a male model to get women to talk to us. Use some of this everyday and you will be amazed at the amount women that come up to you. It also works great if you have a first or second date and want to get lucky.</li>
    <li> ***Update 2/3/2013 So I read these reviews that gives this product 1 to 2 stars and I just wanted to say that if you have no game or youre being incongruent with the signature(basically if youre not acting like a alpha male) then youre not gonna get results. You must approach a women and have a little game when using these pheromone. Think of them as a persona in a bottle and you must act out the signals that these products are sending people. Also YOU MUST RUB THIS WELL ON THE PRESSURE POINTS ON YOUR SKIN.  Ok thank and I hope I help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this around my friends(male and female) since we get into alot of arguments. ever since i&#x27;ve been wearing it i&#x27;ve been having less arguments..... now i just need to find a girl of my own.</li>
    <li> Good Product, and deliver what offers.  I guess is a good social blender to be around womens.. very nice..  Good expirience</li>
    <li> In the past, using pheromones had brought me mixed results. Some of the brands work much better than others. Arouse Rx works the best out of any pheromone I have used EVER. It&#x27;s not a miracle where you put some on and women flock to you. It HELPS you get the girl, but you still need to shower/shave/dress right to get their eye in the first place. Once a lady shows interest in me, I use the other secret to getting the girls, ask them questions. I can usually count of taking home a girl when I use this, doesn&#x27;t work every single time, but it works a very large amount of the time, like 8 times out of 10.</li>
    <li> Really terrible the product, does not fall in this deceit, please, they do not lose its money as I in this articulate deceptive, it does not serve for anything such oil and it smells bad, and excuse my sincerity</li>
    <li> Til this point I&#x27;ve never really seen the point of writing reviews on things, but with all the fake reviews and non-believers out there I figured I should try to at least set the record straight. I just saw a review in the 1 star column that prompted me to write this so I will copy-paste the basics so I don&#x27;t have to reiterate what you should understand about pheromones if you&#x27;re going to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these and other pheromones before just because it&#x27;s fun to see the effects. If you use the right dose you should definitely see some effects and you have to at least have the women in your general space(it will NOT lure a woman from across the bar). Also, if you sit back to wait for the magic happen nothing is going to come of it. What pheromones do is send subliminal messages of attraction of an alpha male. If you sit back and wait for women to tackle you, then you&#x27;ll be waiting for a while. Also, if you use too much; I&#x27;ve personally had older women show some unsettling interest. So, take note when you use it try to take into account that you are adding something to what your own body chemistry already makes. Being that I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3 295lbs of muscle I cannot over apply this because my levels are significantly high as it is. Personally, I use 2 drops on the chest and one drop on each shoulder. Not only are women more smiley around me without me trying anything, but they also are more physical when it comes down to it. Also, layer it with a good cologne nothing too overbearing though. I&#x27;ve found that to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note, this particular brand doesn&#x27;t last all that long (maybe 4 hours tops) but they are quite strong. Like I said before application is very important. Apply to points of your body that sweat and DO NOT rub it in( kind of like applying cologne) all that does is kill the lifespan. Also, this should go without saying , but make sure you&#x27;re showered to ensure you get positive effects.</li>
    <li> Does not even work as a good moisturizer, let alone what it&#x27;s intended for.  So guys, rely on your own charm, it worked for me and there should be no reason why it should not work for you.</li>
    <li> I been using pheromones for years with varying levels of success.  Then I read about these on a message forum and was intrigued at the combination of 4 different pheromones.  Let me tell you, this is some potent stuff.  Women DEFINITELY pick up on my scent.  With the other pheromones I was using, sometimes I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it was me or the pheroes.  With Arouse-RX there is no doubt that they are under my spell.  I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a cook at a restaurant and I work with two women ages 21 and 28.I&#x27;ve only worked there a short time,and at first they didn&#x27;t pay much attention to me.I&#x27;m 51 but most people,including these two girls thought I was in my 30&#x27;s because I do take care of myself.Even though I do look younger than my age,they didn&#x27;t really get flirty until I tried wearing Arouse Rx to work.I don&#x27;t even pretend to notice that they&#x27;re flirting,but at they&#x27;re age they are naive enough to think I don&#x27;t notice the change,so it&#x27;s really kinda fun watching this happen.Even some of the female customers that I happen to get close to in the dining room do a double take which I notice,but I pretend not to,as I have to appear professional.I&#x27;m not ugly,but I&#x27;m no Brad Pitt either,and this stuff is gonna make gettin laid so much easier for sure!!!I&#x27;m in no way associated with this company,and I say that because this review probably sounds like an info-mercial.I&#x27;m tellin you guys,this stuff works cuz I can see it in these womens eyes and actions.If you&#x27;ve experienced that look in a woman&#x27;s eyes when you know it&#x27;s at that point when she&#x27;s gonna do you...yeah,it&#x27;s like that!You know the look.It&#x27;s too bad the two I work with are hooked up with someone else already,cuz I know they&#x27;re close to that point because of this stuff.I don&#x27;t mess with chicks that are seein someone.I don&#x27;t need the drama or all the BS that follows!I&#x27;m tellin you guys don&#x27;t doubt this stuff it works and you only need a few drops,so it&#x27;s really cheap for how long a bottle will last you.</li>
    <li> It is crazy when you think about it but pheromones are real and they work. Just the other night I used some before going to the club and I danced with almost every woman there and I got to pick which one I wanted to take home. I think body heat helps make it more intense. Stop thinking about it and get this.</li>
    <li> I just received my order yesterday and just tried it out today. Now I don&#x27;t know for sure but these pheromones really work fast, I just walked into the laundry room and this really cute girl came in behind me and I just dabbed on a few drops and I don&#x27;t know if the pheromones were working but she just actually noticed my presence. Maybe it was my confidence but I believe these pheromones played a role and I can&#x27;t wait to test them out tonight.  I&#x27;ve had these pheromones for nearly two weeks and this product has literally changed my life! This manufacturer now has a new dedicated customer, as soon as my bottle gets lows I&#x27;m ordering more.  I have been using the pheromones for a month now and just bought my second bottle, not only has this product gotten me attention but thanks to this product a girl I met contacted me a couple days later to come over and that night was the best night of my life.</li>
    <li> I have been using Arouse-Rx for 4 years now with mostly good results. I work in sales and have found that pheromones can be very helpful when trying to persuade a client to buy my product. In fact, I wear a little bit of both (Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) when I know I&#x27;ll be meeting with a male and female client in the same day. It pays for itself!</li>
    <li> Tried this for several months.  One time a woman started talking to me in a public place which was encouraging.  Then I remembered I had not worn the product that day.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change overall.  More importantly:  One night I REALLY wanted this stuff to work with my wife, so I used a healthy amount.  Well - no effect there either:  not that time and not any other time.  These reviews do not make it easy to tell what is going on with this product but it did not work for me and it is not returnable.  So, I will not be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said I have some left and I suppose I&#x27;ll use it some more, I will update this if anything changes but it&#x27;s been several months and I doubt that will be the case.</li>
    <li> I work in customer service and a lot of ladies notice but know it is the pheromones. For an amp effect wear it with some cologne</li>
    <li> If there are any pheromones in this product, they are too diluted to have an effect. I have used over ten different pheromone products. Some that work and some that don&#x27;t. I tried this one initially because it was cheap when I first was getting interested in pheromones. Save your money for something more reputable.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest Aqua Vitae by Liquid Alchemy Labs or  Scent of Eros (gel packs for men)  by Love Scent both of which can be purchased right here on Amazon. Unlike Arouse-Rx, these products create the subtle, yet noticeable, effects of a pheromone cologne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. I expected a little more results but I guess you can&#x27;t replace old fashion &amp;#34;getting to know&amp;#34; someone. Not worth the effort or money.</li>
    <li> It never worked. It is waste of money that is selling on Amazon. I agree with other negative reviewer, majority of the 4 and 5 star reviews are fake.</li>
    <li> It is a scam don&#x27;t buy, first and last amazon review. It is that much of a scam DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews i ordered this and gave it a try..i work in the hotel industry where i get a lot of ppl and beautiful women.....did not see any difference....nothing in particular....i did better with my own skills of words then this...waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and also my buddies.  No one ever told me if it works as all is in your head.  I never felt any effects of it.  I checked the reviews here and many are written by people , who have only one review and that of this Product.  What does that tell you ?.  these are probabley sales people who pump this product.  Sad, I no more count Amazon Reviews when making purchases.</li>
    <li> 3 drops was all I needed for an incredible experience at my friend&#x27;s party last week. I was getting play from all the fine ladies all night long, sometimes talking to 3 at a time. I&#x27;m not really as player, but I sure felt like on that night!!! These pheromones are amazing and I will be definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> This is the stupidest thing i have ever purchased!!! it dosent work. Dont buy this, i think if you want a girl you should learn how to get into her pants and then make her cum a few times, then you have her eating out of the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> It does what it said I&#x27;m realy happy with the product</li>
    <li> Been using variations of this over the years but this is the one that seems to have the greatest effect on women. When I go up to a lady I also make sure I talk low so she has to lean in and that helps to get more pheromones to her. It works and if you don&#x27;t use it you are honestly missing out.</li>
    <li> A friend and I were discussing pheromones and decided to test this out to see if it was us or the liquid. I got us a bottle of this stuff and we did a test over the course of a month. 2x a week we would go out, one would wear the pheromones and the other wouldn&#x27;t and we&#x27;d see how many phone #&#x27;s (or more) we could get. The next week we&#x27;d go to the same place again and the other person would be wearing the pheromones.  After the first 2 tests there was no doubt this stuff worked. Whoever wore it always went home with a girl. Now we each have our own supply and use it regularly.</li>
    <li> After a long and painful divorce, my self confidence was really low.  I knew I needed to get back in the game but just didn&#x27;t have the mojo to approach anyone. I did a search and found this so figured I&#x27;d give it a shot, what did I have to lose?  I wore it to work the other day and the cute secretary was totally hitting on me!! I&#x27;m totally gearing up for the next work happy hour to make my next move.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other pheromones before, but Arouse-Rx seems to be the most potent. I just ordered another bottle and will back for more.</li>
    <li> The reviews here are real and I know becasue I ordered some Arouse and it worked for me. With the help of Arouse I had the confidence to ask out someone I&#x27;ve been crushing on forever. We have been dating for over a month and I noticed when I use Arouse my gf is much more aggressive. I belive in this and I will be giving it out to my friends for their bdays.</li>
    <li> Does not work. I used on wife and massage therapists. No change.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really good.</li>
    <li> **MARCH 2nd, 2012 CRITICAL CONCLUSION REVIEW**&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally posted the review right below, and bcs Amazon only allows 1 review per customer - I am editing it and now have changed rating to 4 stars (my thoughts are 3.5 stars but amazon dun have 3.5! LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say right now, after using the entire bottle, and logging down my daily observations - using it alone, or paired with other fragrances - this stuff works. Disclaimer : my observations are for me alone since my chemical makeup would be different from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a. using it alone , I find people avoiding me or not giving me 2nd looks (as mentioned in the earlier below review). The thing was not that it wasn&#x27;t working. It works - it gave me a slight alpha-Male \\&quot;persona\\&quot;. IE, people wont approach me (a boss/authoritarian \\&quot;feel/vibe\\&quot;), unless I approach them in-which case they are more respectful with a slight awe-friendliness. But that&#x27;s it. They just won&#x27;t approach a \\&quot;dominant\\&quot;-vibe kinda person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b. using it *with* a nice sweet smelling fragrance. Now, the effect I wanted kicks in. People friendlier and approachable. Excellent for work at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c. using it with another *pheromone* product designed to give a feeling of sunshine/bubbly-ness. This is the **epitome**. Works no matter where I am or what I do. Get 2nd/3rd looks. On the bus, as I walk to the rear of the bus to take a seat, women would look at me, hand-comb their hair, adjust their clothes to assure they are tidy or presentable. Just about 80% of the time I have such observations. 20% of the time when I don&#x27;t obtain such observations is when the scents don&#x27;t linger enough or there are competing scents (like in parties/clubs) , in which case I have to increase dosage of both pheromone products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone to buy 3 btls from New World Health. The only product that is *better* than this product (alpha-male dominance) with actual testimonies is US$110 bucks. That product stands at a way 7 stars (sorry amazon.. u only have max 5). Unfortunately Amazon is not selling that product. Still 3 btls vs 1 bottle of that 7-star product to me is worth my money, now that I know how to use pheromone products \\&quot;properly\\&quot; . thanks to a forum. Made me more educated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this product is not for the uninitiated or for those looking for instant quick-fixes. Want a quick fix - there are but one has to spend to experiment with which products are suitable to *you* per se.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers&lt;br /&gt;Calvin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**NOVEMBER 21st, 2011 REVIEW (RATED 1 Star)**&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, after reading so many positive and not-so-positive reviews on this product here, I went ahead and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came 3 weeks (I am overseas consumer) and started trying it out - conscientiously. Followed instructions as on the label. 3 times daily - a few drops on wrists and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not work for me. But I won&#x27;t say it does not work at all since everyone&#x27;s \\&quot;pheromonal\\&quot; makeup is different. I dun get 2nd looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that said, other brands (cheaper ones too) using synthetic pheromones work better on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the fact that this product is unscented projected in myself as \\&quot;does it work ? is it still active ? etc etc\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With other brands that \\&quot;work\\&quot; on me - these are scented and myself being able to whiff the scent(s) know \\&quot;it&#x27;s still in effect\\&quot;, hence perhaps I project greater confidence when I look girls in the eye and when I talk with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a really strong vibe that it boils down to the psychological edge these products imbue in the user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate having bought this here @ amazon. Just wished that I could buy other products that are available to ship to world-wide destinations outside USA.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product on the advice of the other glowing reviews here on Amazon and had high hopes that I would achieve even a fraction of the positive results the others have.  Well, I was sorely wrong.  I tried it for two days in a number of situations where I was in close proximity of women of all ages and I got absolutely no extra attention whatsoever.  Actually I was completely ignored!  Since purchasing this \\&quot;vegetable oil\\&quot; I have since researched a number of legitimate pheromones and will be trying those soon.  Take my advice, skip this one, do your homework and get something worth the money!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe other reviews which make this product look magical. It does not work! I wore it for every party, get, etc. and I did not see any change in behavior in the nearby women. When I first bought this product I thought that the bad reviews were people trying to damage the reputation of Arouse Rx but no, it were the good reviews which are damaging our wallets because this thing does not do what it suppose to do, attract women. Is not like I&#x27;m bad looking, I am good looking (not a model, but still good looking) my problem is that I AM too shy to be the first one to speak to a woman in a bar...</li>
    <li> At work, I might see perhaps 50 people in a day as I move around a lot in a busy building. I wore this for a week or two and I had no changes in responses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that the day after I wrote my negative review I got 10 negative down votes. If you look at all the views, you see a consistency in this. Any review that has something good to say about the product get nothing but up votes. The ones who have anything bad to say are down voted without mercy. Positive reviews are done by people with only one review as well.. the product here! I noticed the same thing for another pheromone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Im giving this a 4 as of now. My ex was all over me a bit more than usual even though generally shes fairly reserved. Other women around me do seem a bit friendly moreso than before. But too early to tell if it truly works.</li>
    <li> Arouse-Rx has worked for me time and time again. I love the way it makes me feel like I am carrying a concealed weapon.  Except it&#x27;s out there in plain sight, and they don&#x27;t even know it. If you already have game, it will work wonders for you. If you don&#x27;t... well I would first suggest a new haircut and some better clothes LOL!!!</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen any major difference in its effects as the product suggests. Placed on recommended areas with the proper amount and really no change in the actions of females that I interact with. Overall not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Waist of time and money, I&#x27;ve purchased many different types of pherimones. Some work better than others. This one didn&#x27;t work at all for me, might have actually worked in reverse. It&#x27;s used in drops, never know if you need one drop or two or three, neither worked anyway. My best experience so far has been with Chikara Cologne for men. My next try is going to be PherX Pheromone Cologne for Men, We&#x27;ll see I guess. Oh, and don&#x27;t waiste your money on this like I did.</li>
    <li> This product is spot on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an ugly guy but I am shy and I got some Arouse-Rx to help with that. I use a little bit right before I go out and I think it&#x27;s working. The extra attention I&#x27;ve gotten from the ladies has really boosted my confidence. My only complaint is that it has no smell, so I have to spend extra money on cologne. I hope they come out with a scented version soon.</li>
    <li> Really impressed with the results. I wear some at the gym and I keep catching women staring when I look in the mirrors. Even the front desk ice queen is even warming up to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to be very honest here. I had no idea what a Sex Pheromones is and I wasn&#x27;t looking for it either. I was looking for some seductive men&#x27;s cologne and this popped up as the first search result. Read a few reviews, thought I&#x27;ll give it a try. Now, I really wanted to see if this thing works or if it was just a scam. The best way I thought to figure it out was to wear it when I was going to sleep with a girl I had already been sleeping with. I have slept with this girl 4-5 times before and she is pretty cold to say the least. So last night we came back home after a few drinks at a local bar, I checked my mail and saw a bottle of Arouse-Rx in my mail. Went to the bathroom, and as the instructions said, put one drop on each on my neck and wrists. Came out, asked my girl friend to take my necklace off(just to make sure she gets a hit from my neck as soon as I put it on). Next thing I know, She was all over me. She was rubbing her hands all over my body, my face, my neck...you get an idea. The make out session was the most intense we&#x27;ve had so far.  I have my proof and I am ready to attract other attractive women ;)</li>
    <li> I gotta say, I&#x27;m impressed. A buddy has been telling me about this stuff and just to shut him up I ordered some. I started to wear mine 3x a day as suggested and it seems that women are looking at me more and seem to be standing closer, and that&#x27;s just at the office. Looking forward to this weekend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT. I used it on New Year&#x27;s Eve and got so much more attention that usual.I&#x27;m on the shy side but wearing this I guess I felt more confident and relaxed around the ladies. I had to do a lot less work than normal.</li>
    <li> the shipping had problem to arrive, but the rest was good, on the right package, good accomodation, the product is pretty much good, but i still waiting for the effect.</li>
    <li> Honestly if this stuff worked they wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep it in stock.  So what they do is make bogus reviews themselves and try to get people hyped up on something that doesn&#x27;t work and will never work!  People are not like dogs and cats, smell is not as stong in humans.    I will say a big, fat wallet will go a lot further in attracting women that this stuff ever will.  You would be better off using water, saving the $30, and at the very least water will quench your thirst unlike this snake oil!</li>
    <li> I always use this stuff before I leave the house, just for that extra advantage, and I noticed that when I fly the stewardesses pay extra attention to me. Still haven&#x27;t joined the mile high club (yet) but I do get extra free booze on the flight.</li>
    <li> There is no smell but it had power. I used it last week and it was v good at the party !!! I talk to 2 girl all night and they almost fight for my convosations. Today I buy 2 bottles for chrismas gifts for my brothers. I hope its good for them too !!!</li>
    <li> Appears to make me more attractive to some women.  Does not drive my wife into a sexual frenzy as I had hoped, but she does give more compliments.</li>
    <li> Well, maybe it&#x27;s only for me, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I tried it more than 3 times and nothing happened. It&#x27;s just a expensive vegetable oil. DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> This  product does not work. Im glad there are no side effects. This is the first time I bought something here that doesnt work. Thats all I can say It doesnt work. Please stop selling this product.</li>
    <li> Arouse Rx has helped me get my wife to get back to be her old self again. When we first dated she was always touching me and wanting to have sex. Last couple of years she really cooled down. I ordered a bottle of Arouse and put some on to see if she would notice.  At first when she got home from work she did her normal routine of ignoring me, but then she came up and gave me a kiss and that look... from that point on it felt like old times again!!  It&#x27;s nice to have fun with her again and I owe it to Arouse Rx.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the pheromone sprays and oils out there and this is by far the most effective. Women are more receptive to my advances which makes my job a lot easier. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My wife goes kiss crazy every time I use this so it works great for me.</li>
    <li> Meh, no effect, had better luck with other products, this one is a dud.  save your money for something worth it.</li>
    <li> I only tried it once at work, but I noticed the effects when I was in the break room and the office cutie started a convo with me out of the blue. I&#x27;m a shy guy and this was a first for me. I will update this review after I have used it a few more times.</li>
    <li> This works and it is real. I hang out with some pick up artist guys and they swear by this stuff. I ordered some and now I know what they mean. It&lt;br /&gt;helps to get the attention of women, but you still need to be able to talk them and close the deal. They aren&#x27;t going to flock to you and rip your&lt;br /&gt;clothes off. What will happen is that women will be much more open to you, especially if you approach them.</li>
    <li> I just had to write in after using these for just a couple of months. I went from striking out to scoring home runs. A lot of it had to do with how I carried myself since I was lacking confidence. I started using these and now I find it easier to meet women and I&#x27;m going on dates. I am a real person and this is a real product that has real results.</li>
    <li> If you have ever picked up a men&#x27;s magazine you have seen ads for pheremones in them and you have probably wondered if they worked. Well, they do work and some work better than others. Arouse-Rx works better than any other brand I have tried. The effects with all pheromones are very subtle, so if you are expecting a magic potion, then go buy a Harry Potter book. But if you understand how these \\&quot;scents\\&quot; work, you will be very impressed with the power.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my brother before I read some of the negative reviews. He agreed to do it and Im hoping to hear some positive results. He is a good looking guy but shy around women. He is very warm hearted once he is approched. Im doing this as an experement to see if it will work. I will post another reveiw later and let you guys know if it really works!! (I gave it 3 stars because I dont know if it will work)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fool.... So goes the saying... \\&quot;there is a sucker born everyday\\&quot;.  I thought I&#x27;d try it, who wouldn&#x27;t want their woman climbing all over them.  Did absolutely nothing.  Nothing.</li>
    <li> After lots of research I kept coming back to this brand of Pheromone. It seems that it has the largest amount of active ingredient and the price was very reasonable especially now that I know it works very good. Now when I leave the house I always put some on my wrists and my neck. I feel like I have a super secret weapon to meet women and so far I have had more action in the past 3 months then in the past 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just found this old review and wanted to give you an update - Shortly after writing this review I went out (wearing my pheromones of course) and met a great lady.  We got married a year ago and are expecting our first kid in August!  I think the only reason she gave me a second look was she was attracted to the pheromones but somehow that was enough for her to want to get to know me better, and it&#x27;s worked out great!</li>
    <li> A GAME CHANGER! MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> Its garbage. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type guy to walk up and approach a woman, I&#x27;m kinda shy that way. The day I got Arouse-Rx in the mail (very quickly) I mixed some in with my cologne and hit the bar. Within 10 minutes of sitting down and ordering a drink, a woman that I passed by on the way in came over and started to chat me up!  We had a pleasant conversation but she had to leave early, so she gave me her number. Just a little while later another lady came over and started a conversation with me. I won&#x27;t go into detail about the entire night, but I had a huge smile at work the next day.  Arouse-Rx has given me the extra edge I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a shy guy and get very nervous talking to girls.  Arouse-rx has given me a boost in my confidence that I never had before.  Girls are a lot more playful around me, for instance a girl sitting next to me in my class started doodling on my notes!  It is helping grow and get over my social anxieties. It&#x27;s just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I never knew if it worked but it was cheap. Lets assume it is a placebo and the effect is just about a self generated feeling of confidence...even so it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to increases you chances of meeting women, you can stop looking. This is real deal and works better than any other pheromone out there. It has no smell so it mixes easily with any cologne you use.  You do have to put in some effort, like decent clothes and a personal hygiene, but this will help break the ice.</li>
    <li> Hey this is the first pheromone review I&#x27;ve ever done and probably the last. I never believed in pheromones,I thought it was just a fake scam,just like other products that offer miracles for a small price. On a whim I decided to try this out thinking \\&quot;what the hell,why not,you&#x27;ve already tried everything else\\&quot;. Wow I&#x27;m so glad I did.    Let me tell you a little bit about myself, I&#x27;m not ugly,nor am I shy with girls. However I do struggle getting past the friend stage with women or getting flirty with them. I do not look like a super model, I&#x27;m actually balding (so I shave my head) and have a quite a gut,but I&#x27;m not obese or anything just a few pounds over. The point is,I&#x27;m not a super model.    I tried this on for the fist time last night,at a friend&#x27;s B-day party at the beach. There were plenty of girls there.  Although the night started off slow (and I was getting disappointed)within an hour or so one of the BETTER LOOKING girls PULLED me aside away from the group and decided to talk to me. We talked for a good hour or so where not only did I get her number,she INSISTED to get me to call her back. After the conversation was over,she INVITED me to follow her to her car (NOW ALL THE GUYS WHERE JEALOUS AND AMAZED),we disappeared for a good 20 minutes or so.    We came back to the party,where 2 other girls JUMPED up and try to greet me (two girls who were total strangers), one of them literally hugged me,the other one wanted to BUY ME a drink. By this point every single guy in the party has a crazy \\&quot;WTF\\&quot; look on their eyes as literally I&#x27;m talking to 5 girls at once,all of them in a circle around me,with girls hugging me,touching me,and just hanging off me like I was the BOSS. It was completely surreal like an Axe commercial.     Towards the end of the night,one of the girls wanted to buy me a shot of Patron. We walk towards the bar alone,lo and behold,two girls come RUNNING out of nowhere,they also want to buy me a shot. Here I am at the bar with 3 girls wanting to buy me tequila shots and drinking it with them. The night ended there,with me having to chose one of the girls to take home as they literally BEGGED for me to take them home.    Just woke up today and my voice mail is full of girls asking me if I want to go out today,but also from my guy friends asking how the hell did I manage to steal the life of the party last night. This product is balls the walls awesome.</li>
    <li> I work in a happening bar in Hollywood and I thought I&#x27;d try this product just to see if it works, since it seems to have glowing reviews. I&#x27;m also already very confident and have no problem approaching women, but I tried the product and laid low for a few days, to see if women would actually flock to me, as other reviewers have said. Zip, nada, nothing. Not even one woman approached me. I also had a housewarming party last week and I smothered myself in this liquid, and nothing out of the ordinary happened. So, my advice, save your money. This falls in line with penis pills and every other liquid or pill that promises something they can&#x27;t deliver.</li>
    <li> Just a few drops is all it takes to get results.  I tried this on the advice of my brother who always has girls hanging off him.  Granted, he&#x27;s a pretty good looking dude with a nice car... But he still swears by Arouse and calls it his \\&quot;secret weapon\\&quot;.  I purchased a bottle last week and can honestly say that it works.  When I am wearing this and talking to a girl, there is a subtle flirtation that is going on that never used to happen to me.  It&#x27;s not going to get them falling at your feet, but once you sense the signals, it gives you the confidence you need to take things to the next level.</li>
    <li> This stuff is junk and does nothing.  Might as well save your money or purchase a good cologne. I did not see any noticeable difference using this product in people&#x27;s response.</li>
    <li> No it does not work a hoax for sure .I am a very good looking guy ,one night put on some of this Arouse - RX went into a car with 3 lovely ladies that are single off to a buisness meeting ,ziltz no lady aproach me in any way as I would be without Arouse - Rx no change,My job has all sorts of single ladies nothing if you believe in fairy tales then this cologne is for you.Still trying to figure out how the 90 Day Money Back Guarantee! works</li>
    <li> The reviews are true, I&#x27;m a believer. I used some of this stuff at my sister&#x27;s birthday party last week, and got with one of her HOTTEST friends who used to practically ignore me before. I read that some people are more receptive to the smell of pheromones than others. She must have been one of them!!! My advice to anyone is to try it over the course of a couple of weeks, because some people cannot pick up on the pheromones while others can&#x27;t control themselves. I have no doubt whatsoever that this stuff WORKS.</li>
    <li> Back in my college days I used to slay chicks at the bar. Time has added some grey to my hair and a couple of extra pounds so it&#x27;s tough to compete for young women with all those jersey shore type guys. I read the reviews here and figured I would give it a try, since it has a money back guarantee. Last week, I mixed some of this with my after shave and let me tell you, it was like 1990 all over again. I can&#x27;t say for sure if it was the pheromones or my natural (aged) charms, but I got 3 phone numbers that night. Either way, I won&#x27;t be returning the bottle.</li>
    <li> I was at a restaurant eating dinner with my family and our waitress was flirting with me and  putting her hands on my neck and shoulder when she walked by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I bought some pizza from Dominos and when I was paying there was a Older women (I am 32 she was 45) standing next to my out of nowhere she started to flirt and asked me what I ordered then I told her, she then  said O! I should go home with you and eat. I said you should!!  Then she gave me her #, and told me to call her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Do have game and that is a must, but I notice women paying more attention to me when  I am at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE GAME AND CONFIDENCE  THIS WILL REALLY HELP!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have no game or confidence you will have no luck.</li>
    <li> Been using the product consistently and have NOT seen any difference from this product, Unfortunately.</li>
    <li> nobady pays on me s***</li>
    <li> It was very worth it...</li>
    <li> Dont spend ur money to this...it is bull s***.that is the worst product i&#x27;ve ever seen.dont spend your money to this again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other pheremones before and this one is the least effective. I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s just not effective as you may think. And I woudnt trust these reviews to be honest because they sound incredibly fabricated. This stuff isn&#x27;t magic it&#x27;s oil. I recommend you read about all other products.</li>
    <li> It does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even told girls to smell me if they like my cologne LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just said I don&#x27;t smell anything. And despite flirting they had nothing towards me.</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work i believe all reviews were written by the seller or friends of. Dont waste your money i was skeptical but i figured i would try it just to see. Im not lacking in the dating department. Does nothing for you</li>
    <li> I was also a doubter like many others people here. \\&quot;No way this stuff works\\&quot; is all I could hear myself repeating in my head. My cousin insisted this was the stuff to get and he&#x27;s never been let down. When it arrived I stared at the bottle and just kept shaking my head but since my cuz kept yammering about it we doused a bit on our necks and hit the bars. Almost right away it was noticeable. When we went up to get beers at the bar both of us had a girl talking to us and when the girl I was talking to ducked out to take a call her friend leaned over and said she thought her friend was really interested in me. That night was awesome and we have gone out 2 more times since and each time has been blast. I will always use this when I go to bars.</li>
    <li> After wearing this product I haven&#x27;t experienced a discernible difference, not to the level the advertising said would be the case.</li>
    <li> When I first used it I did not notice any difference in the behavior of the women around me, but I didn&#x27;t quit.  I continued to use the product and I am positive it finally had an effect on two women sitting beside me on the train.  It is not driving women stark wild crazy as some may think or hope, but I do think that some women are more sensitive than others when it comes to scent as a sexual driver.  In other words it seems to work on some, but not all.  I think this product may help in my search and increase my chances of success.</li>
    <li> I have used pheromones before. The last one I bought was great. It&#x27;d not just to help you meet women, I also used it to add a more positive spin on my presence when working with clients etc. Always can spot the difference right off. This one sadly did not do anything noticeable. Go some where else and good luck.</li>
    <li> it really didn&#x27;t do what It advertised  all women really want to do was to smell me but no arousal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before and it worked so this time I tripled the order, and I&#x27;ll order again as soon as I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> Great product really works, my gf uses it with product as well to attract other women , makes the sarging more interesting.&lt;br /&gt;Pua&lt;br /&gt;Master&lt;br /&gt;Luchin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a second year bio major at NCSU. When I first saw this, I really just ordered it as a joke. It came in the mail and I tried it on (which I originally didn&#x27;t even plan to do). Let&#x27;s be clear, I&#x27;m very good with girls, but with this, most of the work is off my shoulders. Instead of tracking down girls and initiating dialogues geared toward a much friendlier encounter later, they come straight to me. It works outside on the way to class, in the library when I&#x27;m not even trying to approach women, and nearly any close social gathering like at a party or club. They come to you, smile, and begin the best conversations which quickly morph into much deeper interactions. Try it out and you&#x27;ll seriously be glad you made the move.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only oily substance you&#x27;re paying for. You&#x27;re better off buying a self help book than this. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it works</li>
    <li> This item is a scam and 90% of the reviews are fake. I purchased this item after a friend claimed he had luck with similar products. I am a good looking confident guy who has no problem getting women, I simply wanted to try this for the heightened experience. This product does absolutely NOTHING! I used as directed even slightly more than 3x a day with NO noticeable results. You literally might as well be just splashing on water. The 5 star reviews are not REAL. They are paid reviews by the seller it is very obvious. It is like reading those cheesy infomercial reviews by those bad actors on late night television. I wore this around my girl friends two nights in a row we did NOTHING out of the ordinary. She wasn&#x27;t more turned on or anything she was just her plain old self. I even egged her on a little to see if I could kickstart a reaction but NOTHING! AGAIN THIS PRODUCT IS FAKE LEARN FROM ME AND DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! ! !</li>
    <li> This product it doesn&#x27;t work it is fake I hope I could get my money back</li>
    <li> I stopped dating a few years ago after my divorce.  I think I forgot how to date actually, and recently decided I have to get back into it for better or worse.  Quite honestly, it&#x27;s been pretty awkward for me, and the women I have met seem to be not that interested, maybe I just lost my flair for it (the last time I really dated was the the early 2000s.) A friend told me about this stuff and I got a bottle as an experiment.  The lady I took out the night I put it on was so in to me.  I swear I did nothing different, I was my boring old self but she was all about me.  I know I&#x27;m older and out of practice, and I don&#x27;t see myself as a player or even pretend that I have game.  I know there are lots of younger guys who can score or whatever alot easier than me.  It&#x27;s great I have a little help in this area now, as I am enjoying getting to know the ladies again and yes, it does feel good when they like me back.</li>
    <li> While this is a odorless product all it seems to be is an oil in a bottle. Have gotten zero results and I put it through a &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; test with several of my friends. I would not recommend spending the money on this product. I will continue to use it until it is gone and will report any change but as far as I am concerned it does not work</li>
    <li> Honestly, I had no idea I would be reviewing this item so fast. But the first night I wear this to a bar, a girl comes home with me. Let me clarify - I am a super-shy, introverted, and average-looking guy - I rarely have success with women, but this thing seems to magically change that. It baffles me and defies logic, but it does what it says. The only reason I am giving it four stars is because I want to try this out further. I am confident I will be able to change this to five stars pretty soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on a few occasions even on a few dates and I have had plenty of luck before using this product and&lt;br /&gt;till today nothings changed. But try your luck maybe sparks may fly!</li>
    <li> One of my items be stolen by the ups driver other was is ok</li>
    <li> This is a great little product - affordable, doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out or anything.  I consider it date night insurance especially on a first or second date.</li>
    <li> May or may not work who knows.  I&#x27;ll update this once I figure it out more</li>
    <li> save your money dont do not work at all. im think all this good reviews are fakes .save your money</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;lol&amp;#34; is the best review this product should get, congratulations to those it worked for, it truly boggles my mind</li>
    <li> well I honestly don&#x27;t know how to tell if it works..... I mean im not an ugly guy so I was getting girls before this product but I was curious so I bought it anyway</li>
    <li> I will be simple and to the point. It is nothing but a small bottle of oil, it does nothing. For this price you can get a good cologne.</li>
    <li> i never ordered this item</li>
    <li> The only thing this aroused was my anger! So testing this stuff I had to run some actual first hand tests with actual women. No change in attitude, mood, or anything between non usage days and usage days in the same setting for weeks on end. If somehow this thing was working on some small atomic level I am not impressed.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try to see if there was any reaction, zip, didn&#x27;t faze any women I met were even affected at all.</li>
    <li> What can I say, there are always phony products out there for the gullible and we can only chalk this up to experience. Please let this be a warning to the unwary, if I could give this product 0 stars I would. However it did ship very promptly...woohoo.</li>
    <li> this product did absolutely nothing a complete waste of money it had absolutely no effect on all I will never buy this product again</li>
    <li> Heard a lot about pheromones and had to give it a try. I noticed that women in my office touch me more (hugs, my back) and when I go out I see women looking at me. I stay away from the woman at work, but its ON when I hit the bars.</li>
    <li> It can&#x27;t be a coincidence! I&#x27;ve only seen her once when I met her, we didn&#x27;t even go out yet, she just agreed to come to my house while we were texting, I didn&#x27;t even call her just by texting, she agreed to see me and come to my house, I still can&#x27;t believe it. She would let me do whatever I want, touching and kissing.... it&#x27;s amazing, she kept talking about what we are going to cook and do next time.   In fact, I got more phone numbers after using this phormones than I had in the last couple of years. This girl was one of them, and the best thing is they all reply when I call or text them.  I felt like she is under my control, she couldn&#x27;t resist me, although she wouldn&#x27;t laugh at my jokes very hardly but than after I don&#x27;t know you get the point... go try it, believe in yourself and believe that it will work for you.  Well there is something I didn&#x27;t like about this bottle is that sometimes it might dropes 2 or even 3 while trying to drop only one.  Usualy I put 3 dropes on my both wrists and try to touch my neck with them, and only 2 drops if I think I might get too close to people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not sure of it&#x27;s the Arouse or just my confidence, when I put this on and go out I meet women and people seem to want to talk to me. I was at a dinner with a friend for a work thing for her this past weekend, we are just friends, but I still put on some of this stuff. During the cocktail hour a few of her co-workers kept coming up to me and lingering. When we sat down to eat all the women at the table were paying attention to everything I said. I always put this on before I leave the house.</li>
    <li> I already own other pheromones products and i know somehow &#x27;how it works&#x27; saying that i tried this Arouse Rx and with no real clear result other than the normal reaction of women and men. Honestly i can tell if this really works or not since i haven&#x27;t feel any difference, still im going to keep trying and experimenting.</li>
    <li> Well all people thinks oh this product is true. Let me know that&#x27;s liar don&#x27;t work .no good product.Always Don&#x27;t believe nothing OK.</li>
    <li> It has no effect. It however made a cat go crazy for me. but it really does not even turn a head.</li>
    <li> Crap didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
    <li> I bought this not trying to pick up strange women but to try to put a fizz back into a 6 year relationship. Absolutely no change it does however give you a feeling of false confidents so you&#x27;ll try to talk to just about anyone just to see if you can get a little reaction.maybe it does work and my relationship is just domed. But I&#x27;d rather have my $30. Instead of a tiny bottle of oil. Remimber 10ml is like .33333 oz so 1 3rd of a oz. if you buy this don&#x27;t expect women to come running.</li>
    <li> Put this on along with your cologne and when you go out you may see the difference in how people approach you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First were the looks from around the room. They are subtle at first, but then I noticed people actively looking around the room. For what exactly? That was my secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess for some it doesn&#x27;t exactly work, for myself I can vouch that it works to some extent. Females are a bit more receptive and friendlier than normal, this theory was tested by interacting with someone that ordinarily is not the most pleasant lady to associate with. I had the same level of confidence I always do: high. I may have made a new friend along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of this review is to let you know that yes this product works, but you also need to do the work behind the interaction as well. You&#x27;ll go further with a few drops of this on, if you are already a friendly and approachable person.</li>
    <li> I dont like at all, don&#x27;t smell anything, and doenst work! 30 Dolares for nothing, i ask a lot of girl to smell it and all the girls told me, Nothing Different, so i guess this \\&quot;Pheromones\\&quot; is a trick to people buy stuff from the industry! I&#x27;m from brazil, thats why my really bad english</li>
    <li> i didnt think this stuff was for real and like the reviews were all fake so i got some and tried it and i no that sumthing was working. this one girl i been sweating forever was all over me at this one party and some other girls were eyeing me. i was looking fresh and this def help me step up my game. its the reals.</li>
    <li> I want my money back. Holy s*** what a scam. $40 boucks that I dont have.  Better spent on a nice cologne or spray.</li>
    <li> I need to get some more.</li>
    <li> Maybe this stuff works differently for each person but I&#x27;ll say it worked wonders for me without a doubt. I&#x27;ve been going to the same gentleman&#x27;s club for about 2 months and befriended the bartender who is super hot. She also does VIP dances and I&#x27;ve gotten 1 every time I&#x27;ve gone. Tonight was the 1st time I went while wearing this oil and she went wild! She did things tonight that she&#x27;d never done in the last 2 months. Afterward she invited me to come back to her place when the club closed. I&#x27;ll definitely be continuing to order this stuff.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived unsealed and the contents had the smell and consistency of light machine oil. I was really looking forward to writing a good review for this product.</li>
    <li> I was thinking about buying this just because I really like girls. Plus the reviews are amazing. But then I decided to see what other reviews the people who had given this product 5 stars had written. Not one had written another review about any other product. That doesn&#x27;t mean they are all lying and they are fake but...I decided to just take my girlfriend out for a cheap dinner instead.</li>
    <li> I had a situation &amp; I&#x27;m not sure if it came from this product or not but, I&#x27;m gonna check it out everyday now that I&#x27;m home from my trip. I read others reviews &amp; now I&#x27;m waiting to see for myself what it&#x27;s all about. Can&#x27;t give much more than that.</li>
    <li> I did my research before buying this product.  It has 4 different pheromones(most of the other formulas have 1 or 2) and it comes with a money back guarantee.  Let&#x27;s just say that I won&#x27;t be returning my bottle.  Not only are women more receptive to my advances, but my co-workers seem to be taking my ideas and opinions more seriously.   I don&#x27;t normally wear a cologne, so I appreciate that this is an odorless mix.</li>
    <li> ok look ppl buy this crap (i know i did) but think bout it... its jus a confidence booster might as well go put water on ur wrists</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I wear it at the office, and not only does it get me flirty looks from the girls, it also seems to have an effect on my boss who is a guy. He definitely has started to pay more attention to my ideas since I&#x27;ve started wearing it. I have read about this sort of effect but didn&#x27;t really believe it was possible.</li>
    <li> If you have realistic expectations, you will be happy with this pheromone. I&#x27;ve used this and other pheromones (Pherx, Pure Instinct, Pherone) and I have experienced the best results with Arouse-Rx. The one thing you need to remember is that not everyone will be equally as responsive to them. And when you do get someone \\&quot;on the hook\\&quot; their responses and signals aren&#x27;t always obvious. I have found the most important thing is to heighten your own awareness while wearing this or any other pheromone product. If you are expecting women to fall at your feet and become your sex slave, you will be disappointed. But if you read her signs and learn to recognize when a woman has fallen prey to your love scent, it will become much easier to get the final results that we are all seeking. All in all, this is the phermone I will be sticking with in the future.</li>
    <li> Before I buy this, just wondering. How many uses can I get out of one 10 mL bottle? Just need to know how many to buy thanks.</li>
    <li> this stuff is tottaly whack. Absolutely does not work. I was curious enough to try it but if you read this... do yourself a favor and save your money.</li>
    <li> Not good i feel like i was waist of my. Money any way he won&#x27;t happen again</li>
    <li> I have been curious about pheromones since I first learned about them in 2006. At that time I bought a very expensive pheromone cologn which barely worked at all and then kind of forgot about pheromones. Then recently a friend of mine had a roll on pheromone cologn product (that didn&#x27;t really seem to work either). This lead me to search for them on Amazon and lead me to want to try several brands. This is the first brand of pheromones that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pheromone definitly worked for me amazingly well. I sort of tried my own little experiments to see if it really worked or not. Yes it makes women attracted, however I found that some women are good at hiding how attracted they are. It doest work on all females I don&#x27;t think, either that or they are very good at hiding it. But I have had some very amazing things happen when wearing this. Women become more sociable towards me, way more flirty. I even noticed my own boss showing signes of attraction. I would go a month without wearing it, then wear it randomly to work and yes there was a HUGE difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the experiments that I performed were letting my friend wear some of this while we were out drinking, without telling him what it was. Just told him it was essential oils that I got from work. He put it on and didn&#x27;t think anything about it. About 10 minutes later, I find him with a girl litterally all over him, kissing him. He has slightly better game than me, but I&#x27;ve never seen anything like that happen to him. Of course he attributed to his luck/game, but I don&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to be carefule when and where you use this. I am a person who never really causes any waves at work, but when I started wearing this there, rumors have started that I am a player and such. VERY unusual for me. Also I noticed that middle aged women respond to this much more, and I actually had a woman grab my crotch last saturday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written but I plan on trying different brands and writing reviews for each one. the next brand I will try is pher X oil pheromones. Hope you found this helpfull/&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Nothing more than oil!!. Beware this product doesn&#x27;t work no matter the amount you use. Save your money and buy a good perfume.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Worked as advertised. Will buy again in the not so distant foreseeable future.  Thank you, everyone should try it!</li>
    <li> I just broke up with someone and have been feeling like it&#x27;s been hard to meet new people.  So on a whim I bought Arouse RX and went out on a saturday night the the bar with my buddy.  This girl at the bar started talking to me, one thing led to another and she gave me her number.  FEel like I&#x27;m back on the horse again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is working yet, I will let you know if it will work, don&#x27;t know, don&#x27;t know yet</li>
    <li> This stuff is a joke.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is just an oily substance. I could even put baby oil on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work at ALL!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> If you honestly feel something different while taking this, then I have a sugar pill for you. The confidence is from you, not a bottle of nut juice. Now grow some and go talk to some women without the Magic Potion #9.</li>
    <li> Everyone please be aware that there are plenty of fake reviews for this product. Actually the vast majority of the 4 and 5 star reviews are fake. I say over 90% are. It is a shame that Amazon cannot clean these reviews up. Someone is creating multiple fake accounts to pump this product up with 4 and 5 start reviews. You can tell by selecting their names and selecting \\&quot;show all reviews\\&quot;. They only have this product listed for their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the individual or company selling Arouse-Rx... sad, very sad and misleading behavior.</li>
    <li> The unscented pheremone is a good tool to have when you want to do a good job picking up the ladies. I mix it with my regular cologne and put some on my neck and wrists. It&#x27;s not oily like others and you won&#x27;t have to worry about it staining your collar or cuffs. When I&#x27;m at the club dancing close with a chick, I can tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Really, it&#x27;s been way too long since I&#x27;ve been on a date let alone kiss a girl in who knows when, I mean seriously. And my problem, I&#x27;m shy. Online I can chat all day and have can have a quick and witty reply, but at social events I&#x27;m the wall flower, drink in hand hoping for someone to chat me up. Recently I attending a networking event and used some Arouse Rx. A simple internet search will tell you all you need to know about pheromones so my question was, just how much was in this stuff. Well, as it turns out, a really decent amount, actually more than decent. HOLY SMOKES!!! I actually had people come up and talk to me and knowing the Arouse was backing me up, I had more confidence than usual and didn&#x27;t stand there stuttering. At one point I was telling the punchline of a joke that had everyone chucking and I noticed an attractive women giving me \\&quot;the eye\\&quot;. I have to say that I am happy with how Arouse Rx helped me out and I plan to keep on using it often.</li>
    <li> After I purchased the product I read the label. It says: Use it by itself. It apparently is not an additive. I used it. It is oily. I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable. No smell at all so it doesn&#x27;t blend with your cologne. I didn&#x27;t do any other changes in my life or my clothing. The only change was this. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Nobody came to me and asked me what cologne I was wearing. :)&lt;br /&gt;I think it is up to you guys not a cologne additive to attract women. In fact, although I am not using it for  a month I got lucky twice so far ;). Good luck on your journey all.</li>
    <li> Finally recovered from a killer pool party this weekend and Arouse made it over the top. Knowing it was a pool party I brought the bottle with me and reapplied after I got out of the pool. I like 15 minutes I had two chicks laughing at my jokes so I invited them to take a dip in the hot tub. I knew if I got them in the hot tub it would be ON!!!! Well, I got them in the and I didn&#x27;t leave until after 1pm the next day. I blame Arouse for the double fun I had. You might think this is fake, but it&#x27;s 100% real, this stuff does happen.</li>
    <li> Everybody&#x27;s body chemistry is different and different pheromones react differently to your individual chemistry. Anyways mine was not a good one.  I really want to know what is in this thing, because I wore it out one night and EVERYONE avoided me like the plague and treated me like I was vermin. Not to sound conceited but I have always attracted men who always chase me around.. I have used other phero&#x27;s successfully.  This one is going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great product but I still haven&#x27;t reaped yet the fruits of this pheromones. I still have to figure out what cologne you have to mix in order for this to work.</li>
    <li> I was super skeptical but decided to give it the old social experiment.  During that time I used it (and honestly the first time I felt an odd high feeling, not euphoric or anything but different.  This didn&#x27;t last) every time I went into this local restaurant who had this beautiful waitress.  Each time I went in (around a total of 5 times) the first time she was our waitress, the next few, she either was or wasn&#x27;t. Either way she would make it a point to come by and chit chat.  Each time a little longer and longer.  I put it on my neck and would lean myself in her direction as if to force the pheromones in her direction. By the end, even if she wasn&#x27;t our waitress she would come by and flirt.  She would move closer to me and always stand next to my side of the table.  My female friends who came with even commented on it.  I also should mention another waitress at the same place decided to start her flirting with me as well. Now this of course worked for my advantage with my main target. Sorry ladies, she WAS my target (of the experiment).&lt;br /&gt;Now I could either say it was this juice or it was my confidence level that was heightened and it worked as a placebo.&lt;br /&gt;If you must know the end of this story with the waitress, well after those few weeks I met someone else elsewhere and am now engaged.  I did NOT use the product with her :)&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> Purchased and just got an empty bottle in the mail  may just be a mishap but annoying as hell .since then  got a new one sent to me seems ok but hasnt really worked yet and usually around alot of women may be a placebo but will see with time .</li>
    <li> Has no reaction from  girls at all wonder if mine is a bad batch</li>
    <li> Placebo effect gentleman!  Placebo effect!  It is your belief in this product that is making you more confident and, I imagine, more attractive.  Believe in yourselves.  No product is going to make you more attractive to women.  Any attention you get from women will be because of how you are behaving, not some chemical you are putting on your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Arouse several times , following directions closely , without any positive results at all . I may as well been using tap water . Very unsatisfied with this product .</li>
    <li> Sometimes I car wear it and not even get noticed, other times I can get noticed a little more.  It depends on the woman and your confidence as well.  This is NOT a miracle attractant.</li>
    <li> Who knows. More of a novelty.</li>
    <li> Things have been cool on the home front after my wife had out first child and the sex pretty much dried up. I was desperate to do something to spice it back up, but getting her to try anything was like talking to a wall. Then I happened across Arouse Rx and it was like she is a new women when I put some on. We are having more bedroom time and she has made a 180. I don&#x27;t want to say this saved my marriage but I did help out a great deal.</li>
    <li> Man, I thought this was too good to be true and all those positive reviews were fake. I was almost convinced that it&#x27;s all garbage, so on a dare with my boy we split the cost of a bottle and took turns using it when we went out. I didn&#x27;t bring home a girl each time I used some, but I had much more confidence and was able to hold longer than usual conversations with women. I did have a couple of good times and I know there will be more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok I guess I have not seen any results</li>
    <li> actually i have been wearing this stuff for two days and i dont see any result  and even im attending college and i couldnt see any difference with my female classmates so until now i think it doesnt work  im disappointment</li>
    <li> waste of money don&#x27;t get it</li>
    <li> Very good, very like, send some loathe to give up&lt;br /&gt;Support, as always, very good&lt;br /&gt;Very good, very like, send some loathe to give up&lt;br /&gt;Support, as always, very good</li>
    <li> I have used Turn up the heat, and Truepheromone products in the past. They worked really good. After I see the reviews, I bought a bottle of this one. This is not working. Didn&#x27;t get any noticable attention with this product. I won&#x27;t suggest this product.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me at all. Too pricey for even trying this, and it was not worth a penny.&lt;br /&gt;And it is also not that easy to apply, it is very uninteresting and feels like a pain in the *** to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this. If you want to seek out girls, develop your physical fitness, groom and keep yourself clean and have good manners; and there you will be on track!</li>
    <li> Decided to try it out. Wore it to work. And all the women were super nice and interested. Wanting to help me or trying to hold a conversation.&lt;br /&gt;It really does something to women but I also feel like it has an effect on me. I feel more confident when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Its legit. Try it out.</li>
    <li> Thanks I still have a good look and here in Brazil the women are the best in the world. Lots of young and nice ladies...otherwise I would trow away  that product. Don&#x27;t waste your money with that. Go to the gym and be a gentleman.</li>
    <li> I have read everything in the forums and everywhere else on the net about this after I purchased it the first time...this is the third bottle I have purchased.  I can only speak for myself, there is *something* to this...I put it on my neck and wrist pulse points and spray my regular cologne over the top.  I do notice the difference in attitudes in some women and I make a game out of just chatting a woman up until either I get a number or a polite &amp;#34;it was nice talking to you&amp;#34; or something like that.  I don&#x27;t need the help, but it is nice to get a little more positive interaction with women.  Nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> I ordered it reading its reviews. I even paid more for 1 day shipment. But so much disappointed. Its totally waste of money. they claim that girls will attract.&lt;br /&gt;It was not even at all noticed by my own girl friend..&lt;br /&gt;useless not recommeded</li>
    <li> Ok, so I bought the pricey oil. It arrived in a pretty small discreet package. I hide this from my wife to see if it would actually work. Well the next day I jumped out the shower threw some on the neck wrist and sides of my head.&lt;br /&gt;then added a cologne. Went on with my day and the wife kept telling me she wanted to rip my clothes off lol. When I asked her why she couldnt really explain it. The next day I had an eye appointment. Got my prescription and left returned later that day (had the oil on) to pick my frame for my glasses. The young lady who was assisting me would not stop talking to me. She kept on and on about her hobby&#x27;s. So as the days past the wife kept sexually attacking me, which I didnt mind lol. My last test I had a dentist appointment woke early that morning hit the gym, showered, dressed to kill. Right before I walked in I applied a nice dose (cologne was already on). Walked in as these 2 ladys were checking my teeth, they would get extra close to me (breast touching shoulders and rubbing). At first I thought to myself well they have to get close to look at my teeth. It really seemed more or less like they were doing it on purpose. Anyway&#x27;s finished up went into the office to get the bills figured and one of the assistance walks back into the office and say&#x27;s \\&quot;I&#x27;ll see you on your next appointment\\&quot; and gave me a devilish grin. So in short women have to be in a close range of you from what I have experienced. Also I have an athletic build, good hygeine, and look fairly decent. So if your not at all attractive and smell bad and dress poorly this will not work. Its arouse oil not miracle oil. So in short yes it works. And Im a real guy the TEXANS have been kicking everyone&#x27;s ass this year and only lost one game so far.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to expect.  So far nothing!!  Wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I used it with my usual cologne and my GF could tell there is something different immediately even tho the product itself is odorless. It works more effectively on some people as I observed.</li>
    <li> never got this product and i honestly wouldnt want it, because they really dont work i did research on product like these and they are just products that pray on peoples need for companionship. Best advice if you want to meet someone, head to your local sport bar, or lounge, and any place that offers a happy hour special and just say hi to every women that make eye contact with and the one thats spark up and conversation with you is the one that is interested SN: not to make yours look needy order a drink and if your not a drinker order some wings so that way you blend in</li>
    <li> This is what it took to get my wife back in the mood. She&#x27;s been just shy of being made of stone and our love making was down to maybe once a month. When I use this she is much friendlier. I don&#x27;t go and use it all the time, just once or twice a week. Thank you for helping out my marriage.</li>
    <li> Waster of money&lt;br /&gt;And a lot for how much this tiny useless thing goes for&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t Waste your money. Try something else</li>
    <li> boys, this additive is imperative to a healthy sex life. Think of it as your daily routine on a Saturday night.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> be honest, couldn&#x27;t we all use a little extra help in the dating department?  this stuff is common sense.  why not wear a pheramone product to give you an advantage in meeting women?  I bought it, and was impressed by the small size of the container.  The oil comes out in small drops and mixes right into my after shave.  it&#x27;s not greasy or anything, and has no smell.  and the results?  well, I meet women every weekend when I&#x27;m out with my friends, but I notice that instead of going up to my friends first, they are often making eye contact with me and leaning in to hear what I have to say.  so maybe the advantage I get is that I&#x27;m now scoring first instead of second! LOL.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t same I&#x27;m the most macho of men.  I&#x27;m slightly built, soft spoken, but I love women, I love taking them out, pleasuring them, taking them on trips etc.  So I see this as just another way to make sure I have everything I need.  Extra pheromones means I can compete with all those jocks out there just as easily as the next guy.  And once they turn their attention to me, the ladies will be very satisfied with what I have to offer.</li>
    <li> Smell nice, but no female didn&#x27;t know I exist. not even a hello. Didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Has no affect on anyone! test on my wife Nothing, Tested on my Colledge babe next door neighbors Nothing even tested out at a club nothing. You can sell it as Nothing in a bottle.</li>
    <li> Tried wearing it around the girlfriend to see if she&#x27;d notice. She didn&#x27;t seem any more aroused than usual but said my cologne smelled different and stronger</li>
    <li> Its regular cologne period. Snake Oil salesmen at it again. Amazon is going to have to find a way to weed these folks out. Garbage is now appearing in too many product catergories with many fake reviews to lure in the new victims.  Amazon you have to tighten up on the requirements for leaving reviews or this crap is going to catch up with you!!</li>
    <li> I purchase this product because I heard so much about it. But I should have known better. This product is a scam. It did absolutly nothing what so ever. Live and learn. It was a waste of $40.00 dollars.</li>
    <li> He said more girls talk to him so I guess it works.</li>
    <li> I think it doesn&#x27;t work or the product I bought is not right.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything, it&#x27;s a placebo effect.</li>
    <li> sometimes its hard to talk to ladies but when i wear this i find it&#x27;s easier to talk to the them cuz they are usually asking the questions and seem really interested in what i have to say i have gotten lots of digits lately</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but I have been using this stuff for a while now and every time I wear it, my batting average goes up.  I don&#x27;t know if its the extra confidence I feel but honestly, women pay more attention when I have it on than when i don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s great for my social life! I would definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to attract girls on the dance flour in clubs. The first time I used it I noticed that it is odorless. I put 3 drops of it on my neck and then put on my kick ass CK euphoria intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this stuff really work but to be honest, it gave me huge self confidence. I have no idea why but I was smoother in clubs... first time wasn&#x27;t that big but my second time.. I dirty danced with more than 10 chicks in one night... My friends were sipping beer alone and shocked looking at hot ladies grinding upon me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes! Yes! Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am not sure if it is psychological thing or pure science stuff in the bottle !!! I am happy with it and highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck guys ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with my cologne for the last two months and haven&#x27;t experienced any changes with the females that I&#x27;ve dated.</li>
    <li> I PUT THIS UNDER MY DAKKAR NOIR AND GO DANCING.  GIRLS DANCE CLOSER TO ME AND I MEET MORE PEOPLE.  LIFE IS GOOD!</li>
    <li> I am recently divorced and I wanted a boost in confidence so I bought a bottle of Arouse-RX. I wore it out to get a bite of dinner, and I met (she approached me) a nice lady. She has children so we decided to take them to the zoo, and take the rest of the day as it comes. I wore the arouse, because I had a big day planned. Unfortunately, I wore too much, in the car going to the zoo, the children were joking about the odor. And once we arrived at the zoo, it seems, things got weird. At first everything was natural, but there was a large group of Japanese tourist that seemed to be following us. I noticed the ladies and young girls in the tour started casually walking around me giggling and generally standing too close to me, the whole time. My date was getting annoyed and her children were getting bored, so we made a bee-line for petting zoo. It seems every animal in the petting zoo was following me around(even the ducks). And when the mothers were bringing their children to pet the animals that were following me, they just started chatting with me, and it was at this point a certain lady, in yoga pants,gave me her phone number ( I did not ask for it).My date saw it, and first she looked like she was going to cry, and then her face flushed red. She immediately ended the date, she cried and then she yelled, and it turns out the lady yoga pants gave me herpes. This stuff works too good, stay away, if you value your sanity.</li>
    <li> I feel like a chick magnet when I wear this stuff.  I go out to the clubs and usually wear it without cologne, I don&#x27;t need it, cuz the girls come around anyways.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be as effective as promoted.  It was also rather difficult to use.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Impressive product you definatly notice the instant attraction and interest to you,A little bit of flirting and there yours have bedded women half my age 25 yr olds a different women on every outing ,excellent product highly recommend</li>
    <li> So i just decided to try it. If you youtube this product you&#x27;ll get no information on it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got this yesterday. I&#x27;ve used it today and yesterday. No effects at all. It doesn&#x27;t work. I wasted money!</li>
    <li> The shipping documents were torn so as to hide some of the information. The chemical make up of the product is impossible and the Amazon comment section has been abused with many fake reviews. How is it that everyone who gave a 5 star review has a generic \\&quot;bot\\&quot; like name and gave it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said I am unhappy with the product .I would have done better to spend my money on a decent perfume.</li>
    <li> Okay so I bought this stuff to see if it works.I read the reviews and they \\&quot;preached\\&quot; that this stuff works I will try it. Hopefully the reviews I read weren&#x27;t really reviews by \\&quot;bots\\&quot;</li>
    <li> came without original box and no expiration date. 100% fake item we try it and no result.</li>
    <li> Spring has sprung.  This cologne makes me feel like a basketball star with lots of groupies hanging on me.  guys take it from me, this is all the wingman you need on a saturday night.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff, which cost me $36 for this little bottle, and I used it as instructed. Take a wild guess how it worked?! That&#x27;s right. It didn&#x27;t. I tried it won cologne and without cologne. I tried it in social settings and in closer, personal settings. Nothing. This stuff is a joke. I had more compliments when I didn&#x27;t use it and only wore cologne. I won&#x27;t buy this again that&#x27;s for sure. Caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> I would totally recommend this to a friend.  I wore this under my after shave the night i met my fiance.  she is amazing, and the kind of girl that usually never gives me the time of day.  but we hit it off that night and just got engaged last month.  This cologne helped introduce us, and then we got to know each other the natural way and fell in love with each other.</li>
