<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Loved all of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Nice little sample kit with some great products. I&#x27;ll be buying the full-size of a few of these, especially the body butter</li>
    <li> This is a nice idea, but the scent made the new mama-to-be nauseous so she can&#x27;t use it.  Perhaps making this scentless might be the way to go.</li>
    <li> My daughter is pregnant, due in October 2013, and I bought this is a &amp;#34;Mother&#x27;s Day&amp;#34; gift for her.  She said the scents are fantastic --- very fresh.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter-in-law. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this gift as part of a congratulations to a first time mother-to-be.  It arrived as scheduled and was appreciated by the recipient.</li>
    <li> i recieved my gift pack and i was very happy with it and glad it was trial size so i could figure out what i liked better. i was a little disappointed the oil cap wasnt screwed on tight and the oil leaked all over the package.</li>
    <li> Since buying this for myself for my pregnancy, I have also purchased this set for others that have become pregnant. I would also suggest this for anyone that likes a little natural skin pampering. Not just for expectant moms :)</li>
    <li> the product was okay, but they should be more clear about it being a trial pack.  I sent this as a gift and was highly disappointed at the size of the product.  It was sent in a regular 9x12 padded envelope, that is how small the package was.</li>
    <li> The women I sent this set to absolutely loved the product. I plan to continue to send this to all my expecting friends.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the mama to be needed!  The shipping was quick and the product was exactly as described.  I recommend this to mothers to be.</li>
    <li> I must say this product is a must have. The scent, the feel. My husband can&#x27;t stop asking me if I wanted him to rub my belly with the lotion. The spray has a nice scent, it helps me when I nauseous. Not to forget, the ingredients are all natural. Good for you, the baby, and you&#x27;d be surprised, also you&#x27;re partner...</li>
    <li> My wife loved this! We are expecting our second child and looking for more natural stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself to try out some of the EMAB products. I think it would also make a cute gift for a mother blessing or earlier as a congratulations gift. I still haven&#x27;t tried the tea (luckily I have had no nausea this pregnancy) the oil I like alot and bought a full size of. The happy mama spray smells like orange-citrus goodness with maybe a slight hint of fresh ginger, and is a nice little aromatic spritz. the wash is not strong enough for my body,I don&#x27;t use deodorant much and it can&#x27;t clean my pits ;-) but I use it on my son and I like how gentle it is for him, idk if i&#x27;ll buy more though. the best thing about the lotion is the smell. like orange creamcicles, but I like a lotion that has more moisturizer in it. It is a very light lotion. overall nice sample kit. cute gift.</li>
    <li> Very nice, but it is quite small, a little sample pack.</li>
    <li> Small samples.  Got this as a gift.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Saved my life when I was sick. Especially the tea. I even bought one as a gift!</li>
    <li> Smell great.  Unfortunately the wife used this stuff everyday and still got stretch marks.  It&#x27;s GENETICS not a cream, that will help your stretch marks!</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t beneficial at all during this pregnancy. The smells actually made me sick. The tea made me vomit.</li>
    <li> A quick way to be comfortable and a great gift.</li>
    <li> Present for expecting mother. She used it throughout her pregnancy and said she loved it</li>
    <li> I bought this for my pregnant sister for christmas. It was shipped fast and comes in a cute little box. :) I&#x27;m a very happy buyer :)</li>
    <li> This product smells great.</li>
    <li> Bought for my sister who is expecting. She loved the package and ended up buying some of the products full size</li>
    <li> My two daughter-in-laws LOVE the product !!!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing came super quick thank u</li>
    <li> This was sent as a gift to a friend, she loves the relaxing aroma and soothing feeling it brings upon her, thanks Earth MaMa Angel Baby.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my daughter.  She loves the Happy Mama Spray and the Natural Stretch Oil.  It is a nice starter kit of soothing products for the mom-to-be.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these!  She has already used the first set I bought her and is now on the second one I just bought!  These are awesome for the mommies to be that are wanting to be chemical free!!!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> An excellent gift full of great smelling products. I love giving this to newly pregnant friends.</li>
    <li> Perfect useful gift for any Mother to be!</li>
    <li> Loved everything that was included in the gift set. I always give it to my friends who are expecting and they always enjoy it. Love their products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift. My friend enjoyed it. She especially liked the tea samples, so I ordered her a box of the tea the following week. The Happy Mama spray is very calming.</li>
    <li> Not a single stretch  mark at all! Their products are all natural, feel and smell great too! The stretch oil is quickly absorbed into skin and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Hopefully my friend will enjoy this as a newly expecting mother. The set looks decent but in my opinion packaging could be better.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my pregnant wife who was having some itchy skin as she grew in certain areas of her body (mostly chest and stomach).  She LOVES them.  It&#x27;s kind of like a sample pack with small sizes of different products so she was able to try different stuff and determine what she likes best... which really was all of it!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved getting this set and she liked all the products, nice scents and tea was good as well</li>
    <li> This is definitely a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; something. It&#x27;s just a sample of the Earth Mama... products, that are very nice, but the price was a little steep for the small amount you get.</li>
    <li> Good little trial size (or travel kit)</li>
    <li> It is an okay Novelty gift to show your special lady that you&#x27;re thinking of her. Be careful of how you order.I thought I was getting this once a month for 3 months, I ended up getting it every 3 months. They even came after our little one was due. I also thought there would be something different in each package but they&#x27;re all the same. One order of this is more than enough.</li>
    <li> not sure if its worth the $ i paid for it but the products are nice. I especially love the lotion and the happy mama spray. The oil doesn&#x27;t come out of the container its in - something wrong with the dispenser and it just leaks all over. Will have to take off cap to use it. haven&#x27;t tried the tea yet but it sounds good.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift for a first time mom who is not familiar with the earth mama angel baby product line. We bought this for a woman soon after she found out she was pregnant. So far, she has loved all of the products!</li>
    <li> Love these products even post baby they are awesome! The scents are lovely and light and don&#x27;t both baby or my sensitivity to strong smells.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved her gift.  She used it everyday during her pregnancy.  I was so happy that she enjoyed this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll recommend this for my friends</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for three of my friends when they were expecting, and they all loved it. I think this a great bargain, for 15$. I hope it never goes up in price, because I plan on buying in the future for other friends, including myself! It  has a lot of great sample sizes and you can test before buying the larger amounts, perfect!</li>
    <li> These products did not help me at all and I found the smells to be not appealing.  I passed them on to another person.</li>
    <li> Nice sample pack. Did not cause any irritation. I liked the body butter and the belly oil, but did not love the scent. I was excited for the spray but really disliked the smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this sample kit for my sister and she loved it.  This was her first baby and I was letting her sample some of the products I used when I had a baby.</li>
    <li> I bought this to be a travel size of their products because I love their body butter and stretch oil. No need to bring the full size ones on my babymoon now. I have also officially decided that this will be my go to gift for all my friends that get pregnant now!</li>
    <li> The wife absolutely loved this set the tea didn&#x27;t agree with her but everything else worked wonders</li>
    <li> The woman I gave this to as a gift loves it and was super excited to open it up and try her wellness tea! Thanks for a great secret santa gift!</li>
    <li> Loved the kit. I got it for my sister, who was suffering from morning sickness, and she loved the spray (and the whose set). As she iPad a lot of friends that are getting preggo right now, she said she would be sending them this kit as well!</li>
    <li> I have not used all the products and that&#x27;s why i take one star off; but the oil and cream fascinate me. The smell of the oil is mild and does not bother at all about my pregnant tummy. Just love it! Wish to buy the bigger one! ;)</li>
    <li> The products are ok, I guess I should of looked closer they are not very big. But my niece love it.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good sampler, my wife tried the products and we ordered large bottles of the ones she liked most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We liked that they were organic and they smelled pretty good too</li>
    <li> My niece was delighted with this prenatal gift.  This is an ideal thought for any expectant mother and nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> It was just enough to get someone who is newly expecting a sampling of what may be helpful to them during a pregnancy. She really appreciated it and loved the different products, enough to buy the full size of some, especially the body butter.</li>
    <li> Big fan of the body butter, and the body wash.  I&#x27;m not sold on the stretch oil- the sprayer doesn&#x27;t seem to be working correctly and the oil is very thick/hard to spread.  The morning spray is not my favorite, but it has helped me keep from vomiting a few times.  Teas were very tasty - would definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with Earth Mama Angle Baby after purchasing this sample pack. The belly oil feels great on my growing belly and keeps me from getting itchy. The foaming wash and lotion both smell terrific and feel nice. Since I&#x27;m in my third trimester I didn&#x27;t have much use for the spray and I haven&#x27;t tried the tea but based on the other products, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 5 count package as a trial option for myself after seeing a friend receive the lotion at a baby shower. Although I am not pregnant, I was looking for an object that offered natural scents and natural ingredients.  Great choice for those looking for organic and natural lotions that still have a pleasant scent and texture.</li>
    <li> I am giving this set 4/5 starts because I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the Happy Mama Body Wash. It smells fine but left my skin very dry and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stretch Oil and Body Butter smells divine and feels GREAT though! I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering a full size of the oil to help me stay moisturized throughout this pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend because I loved using the products when I was pregnant. My favorite was the belly oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my pregnant wife having our first child. I bought it in the suggested combo pack with some cute baby books, and threw it all in a gift diaper bag. This pack has some nice small samples of lotions, teas, and creams that she was already interested in trying. She is really happy with it so no reason for me not to recommend.</li>
    <li> My sister loved it and was appreciative of her gift as a second time mommy</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really comment on the product....it is a gift.</li>
    <li> Wonderful introduction kit into the Earth Mama Angel Baby line of products. We&#x27;ve been using the stretch mark oil with wonderful results and wanted to try some of the other products without committing to full-size bottles (and prices). This would be great for a new mom-to-be that wants to try out some products for herself and baby.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this gift set for a friend who is expecting! I find it&#x27;s the perfect gift for that new mamma-to-be right near the beginning of her pregnancy! Both recipients LOVED it and loved each item in the set. I personally have been using the Earth Mama Angel Baby body lotion and stretch oil throughout my pregnancy religiously and can&#x27;t rave enough about it. Their products really are the best. Although stretch marks have a great deal to do with genetics and how quickly your growing belly  expands, I&#x27;ve been fortunate not to have any stretch marks yet (I&#x27;m at 37 weeks) and I would say a great deal of that is because of these lovely products! Perfect gift for a friend, family member, or one&#x27;s self to try them out ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my best friend and she loved it soo much especially the tummy lotion and the nausea spray. she said it helped sooo much.</li>
    <li> Nice sample set for mother to be. It was smaller than I thought it would be but a nice sample set. I would still recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my pregnant sister and she loved it. It&#x27;s a nice little sample of products, her favorite was the &amp;#34;Happy Mama&amp;#34; spray. It&#x27;s a great size and price for a little thinking-of-you gift.</li>
    <li> Brought this for my daughter and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift to expectant mother, and she said she loves it.</li>
    <li> I ♡♡♡ Earth Mama Angel Baby products!! This is a wonderful gift set to give!</li>
    <li> The happy spray didn&#x27;t have a lot of smell so that was a rare miss for this company. I loved everything else. I bought a bigger size of the oil because it makes my belly feel great. I&#x27;m growing faster with baby #2 and my belly itches a lot. The wash was ok but nothing fancy. The tea was amazing. The lotion was great but other lotion works just as well.</li>
    <li> Simple ingredients that are natural and do not hurt a new momma&#x27;s skin. Sent to my sister and she loved it.</li>
    <li> Perfect little mommy to be gift for my daughter in law!  She loved it!</li>
    <li> This product was a gift for my pregnant daughter.  I was attracted to the Earth Mama Angel Baby products because of the natural and organic ingredients.  I made a gift of this a couple of months ago and my daughter reports that she uses the tummy lotion nightly and loves how it feels even though she&#x27;s seeing no sign of stretch marks...yay!  Apparently the fragrance is acceptable as well.  I took a chance not having smelled these products before and was happy that my daughter found it pleasing.  I&#x27;m glad I chose this item and can recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love this product because they are organic for one, have very nice scents, and they are absolutely perfect for gift giving.</li>
    <li> Recipient of this gift loved it!</li>
    <li> As a gift. Wife had an allergy to one of the products :(</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell and the body wash burned my sensitive skin, the tea did not help for nausea.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and for the price it was tiny. It was not much of a gift.</li>
    <li> sent this to my daughter whom is delivereing in july, she absolutely loves  the products in this set, and loves the scent</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a friend&#x27;s gift and the box that the five little items came in looked like it was stomped on prior to sending. I had no time to get a replacement gift so it was a little embarrassing to give! Taking the items out of the box was not really an option since all of the information regarding their contents is on the box... Luckily my friend is understanding, but I would recommend that the seller not send this product in a flimsy ENVELOPE because I&#x27;m sure many people buy this item for a gift.</li>
    <li> The spray is amazing!  It helped with morning nausea as well as works as a pick-me-up throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This whole package together is about the size of a sandwich bag. Very small for the price.</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift to a newly-expectant momma, and I think the way it&#x27;s put together, the items, and the price are all perfect for gift giving! (The price is cheaper than from the manufacturer). I have used their products before, which is why I was excited to see a gift set. GREAT for a baby shower!</li>
    <li> Nice product, but much smaller than expected.  It is like sample sizes.  Not fun to run out so quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It all smells amazing, i love the way it feels on my skin. Not sure how well it will work in the long run but as of now very satisfied!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to used, but the bottle is too small. smell is very well. If you need the some special goods, it is good for you.</li>
    <li> I received this little set in the mail today and everything is just so nice.  The Happy Mama Spray is amazing.  I&#x27;m one of those people who is super sensitive to smells, especially when I&#x27;m pregnant.  I also feel queasy pretty much all day long.  The spray just smells so good and really does the trick of perking me back up.  I&#x27;m ordering the big bottle now, because I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be spraying this all over myself and my home!  This set would make a lovely gift for a sensitive mama-to-be.</li>
    <li> I sent this to a girlfriend who found out she was expecting.  She loved it so much.  It&#x27;s a great sampling of all natural products, perfect for a new mama to use!</li>
    <li> I used this when I had my babies and loved it. Got it as a gift for a dear friend.</li>
    <li> Perfect price for what you get.  You get to try all the products.  I got to choose which ones I wanted to buy the full version of.  The stretch oil worked awesome during my pregnancy and smelled fantastic.  The lotion rocks too.</li>
    <li> I gifted this to one of my best friends who wasn&#x27;t familiar with this brand and she fell in love. She has thanked me numerous times and I can&#x27;t recommend this brand enough. These products are way tooooo good not to share the love.</li>
    <li> My daughter is pregnant with her first child.  I wanted to send her a little pampering for herself.  She loves the lotion.</li>
    <li> Cute gift for moms especially if they have never used more natural products! I love EMAB and I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my best friends pregnancy survival kit! As soon as I got word of this amazing news, I knew I wanted to put a gift basket together for her. She loves butter butter and spray and other goodies and is really getting use of the tea right now, unfortunately. I also put in saltines, ginger chews, The Belly Book, The Baby Owners Manual, Tums, stress relieving lotion from Bath and Body Works, tissues, wet wipes, and mints.</li>
    <li> The mama-to-be who received this gift package was very pleased.  The items look like what is depicted in the picture.</li>
    <li> This item made a beautiful Christmas gift. Thanks so much!&lt;br /&gt;Mari LaFore</li>
    <li> Super cute and useful gift for an all natural organic pregnancy. Great gift.</li>
    <li> Great little gift your pregnant friend. Who doesn&#x27;t love all natural these days.</li>
    <li> Brought as a recommendation of a friend the products are organic and smell friendly. I would recommend it to the next mother that&#x27;s like the natural/non-harmful products.</li>
    <li> My daughter who is pregnant just loved this set. It helps her feel better when she had nausea, etc. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend that is a mommy to be. She told me that she loves the product and has already ordered more. She also bought the same for another friend of hers.</li>
    <li> I always treat the mother-to-be when she&#x27;s expecting, after all, she does all the work. This was a sweet little gift which helped her out before and after the delivery. Had some surprises which are still helping and good ideas from the samples.</li>
    <li> This product was a gift for my pregnant . I was attracted to the Earth Mama Angel Baby products because of the natural and organic ingredients. I made a gift of this a couple of months ago and my daughter reports that she uses the tummy lotion nightly and loves how it feels even though she&#x27;s seeing no sign of stretch marks...yay!

I&#x27;m glad I chose this item and can recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Got this little group of products for pregnant daughter to giver her a lift in spirits and it worked!! It is a small collection of very fine products to use while pregnant..such as belly cream..just a special little something to show you care. Do it!!  She will love it!!</li>
    <li> This was for our daughter. She&#x27;s going to have our second grandchild.&lt;br /&gt;This couldn&#x27;t have been sweeter.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! Thank you!</li>
    <li> As a prenatal yoga instructor, I really do love Earth Mama Angel Baby products.  The 5 Count pack offers great pregnancy care items, at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the item to give to my pregnant daughter, for Christmas, but it never showed!  After contacting Earth Mama Angel Baby, I found out that my package was destroyed in the mail.  I was pleased with the way the situation was amended, but sad about the lateness on my daughter&#x27;s Christmas present, as she does not live in same city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also, ordered one for my pregnant daughter-in-law.  Since she lives in the same city, I gave it to her soon after arrival.  The items were welcomed to help with nausea, and other pregnancy care.  Expectant mom and dad enjoyed the fragrance!</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend. She enjoys it very much. Everything has a wonderful sent. ( She says the butter smells like Fruity Pebbles ). Only 4 because she did not like the Happy Momma aroma spray. But just because she does not like the smell does not mean its all bad. She&#x27;s very sensitive to taste and smell.</li>
    <li> I will definitely be ordering more of this product. I ordered it for myself to try as the brand was recommended to me. I will definitely be ordering more of the body butter as well as the stretch oil</li>
    <li> Product is much smaller than I thought! However, overall the lotion and oil are good quality. Get it for your soon to be!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and I thought it&#x27;d be a larger quantity than it is (misperception on my part since it has the weights etc.) Anyway, it&#x27;s packaged nicely and I&#x27;m excited to give it to the mama to be</li>
    <li> This was a nice sampling of products for a mom-to-be.  Sampling is the key word here as the bottles are very small.  It does give her a little trial of a product to see if it&#x27;s something she would like more of but I expected the products to be more ample.</li>
    <li> Awesome Earth Mama products. A great shower gift or kit for any mama to be. Would be a great kit to take to the hospital/birthcenter.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my friend, and she loved it! Comes with little samples of products that mommas to be could definitely use. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Already bought three times as a gift for my friends. They love butter the most.</li>

    <li> I gave it to my sister in law as a gift and she loves it! She said everything smells really good!</li>
    <li> A sweet little gift for a pregnant friend!</li>
    <li> Loved all of the pieces within this set.  It was a nice way to try each before buying a larger volume.</li>
    <li> My wife liked it but the bottles are very small. About the size of hotel shampoo bottles. I thought they were bigger.</li>
    <li> Anything by Earth Mama I love especially the teas. This gift set is a great introduction to some fabulous products.</li>
    <li> A bit smaller than I thought, but it was a gift to my best friend. I&#x27;m not even sure if she&#x27;s used it. But it shipped on time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small &amp; the sicker holding it together had been obviously opened by someone else.  The products in the box are sample-size.  I bought for a shower gift &amp; had to get something else at the last minute.  Not worth the price I paid of about $18 with tax &amp; free shipping.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells so good, I want to douse myself in all the products. My husband loves the scents too. I bought this little kit to see if I liked the products &amp; tea, and I love all of them &amp; want to buy larger quantities of each.A great gift for any mom .</li>
    <li> bought it for my pregnant cousin and she loved it. I would recommend it to anyone who is expecting. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great products to use during pregnancy.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about toxins and chemicals being absorbed and transfered to the little one.  I like the body butter better than my old one!</li>
    <li> Recomended. Excellent product. It is a very nice set for mama to be  :) very nice design. Thanks a lot guys. Highly recomended, thanks. Hope you like it too.</li>
    <li> The recipient of this loved the products. She&#x27;s thanked me multiple times, saying the anti-nausea spray really helped her.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these now, after personally using EMAB products on my own - these were gifts for mothers to be! GREAT GIFT IDEA!</li>
    <li> This is something I think every momma to be should have! I haven&#x27;t tried to tea, but I love everything else! Already purchased a full size spray and oil!! :D Great organic products!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to an excepting friend! She LOVES the products!</li>
    <li> EMAB has great natural products but for me they smell terrible. My husband hates them too. The belly balm and belly oil work wonderfully but smell so strongly of calendula and citronella (i think) that I almost stopped using them. I am a fan of organic and natural skin products and I find EMAB to be one of the best but I did not end up buying anymore from this company because I hate the very herbal earthy scents. They do not blend well with my natural body smell. Instead I used Shea Moisture which smells divine, is much cheaper and available at places like CVS and Target and is 100% natural and mostly organic.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, none of the products worked for me.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law loved it so much she&#x27;s reorderd full sizes of several of the products. It was a perfect little gift pack to tell her I&#x27;m thinking of her.</li>
    <li> Great little kit for an expecting mother.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit as a present and i love how it looks. It is not tiny but a nice normal box which is beautifully decorated and shows what is inside. I think this is a good idea if you want to give some love to a mother to be :)</li>
    <li> A very nice kit for a mama-to-be who is worried about nausea and stretch marks. Plan on giving this kit as a gift to all my friends as they start families.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister in law for baby number 2. She loves this product, but I was embarrassed giving it to her. The box was smashed and torn, and just looked like it was shipped all over the place. When I received it, it was sent in a brown envelope! You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d do a better job on shipping something like this, a product for a mama-to-be.</li>
    <li> This brand is a great brand! I&#x27;ve used a lot of Earth Mama products and this has been great for on the skin (belly) while it&#x27;s growing. I&#x27;m 32 weeks now and I don&#x27;t see a single stretch mark. Smells great too!</li>
