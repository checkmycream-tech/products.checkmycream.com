    <li> Really awesome conditioner.  My hair is bleached and i am always told what good condition it is.</li>
    <li> Wonderful deep conditioner! Smells like yummy vanilla cake batter! Makes my hair so soft and shiny!! Love love love AG hair products!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use my shampoo and conditioner. When I have my conditioner i use on I will add this to my end and throughout my hair sparingly. I let it sit for 5 minutes and it has does wonders for my hair! Soft, silky, and manageable. I do color my hair and it is thick and coarse.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once, but oh my gosh it has already helped my hair so much. I just recently bleached my hair and I&#x27;ve been so upset over the condition of my hair. This mask made it feel so much smoother and it looked less damaged.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s an awesome hair conditioner. I use it pretty much overtime i wash my hair, and once in two weeks leave it in for 25 minutes to give my hair extra moisture and shine!</li>
    <li> This is an unusually good conditioner.  I use it as alone as an intense conditioner or in combination with a regular conditioner.</li>
    <li> It made my dyed hair softer and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this mask treatment to anyone who has keratin in their hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hairstylist recommended the intense anti breakage mask.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels soft and feels manageable, no tangles. I have no regrets using this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a spa treatment in my hair.;)</li>
    <li> Very hydrating. Received it very quickly. My hair dresser was trying to sell this to me for $45, glad I found it on here.</li>
    <li> I never rate any products but this product definitely deserves a review. My treated hair had tons of split ends and it was very dry. I had tried every single thing and nothing had worked. This product stopped my split ends and my hair is finally healthy and growing. Love this product!! It&#x27;s amazing! I def recommend it.</li>
    <li> It did decrease breakage I think, haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really see a difference. It does make my hair smoother.</li>
    <li> My weekly treatment for my colored bayalaged hair. I have a ton of fine very long hair, I am in the salon every 6 weeks for cut and color, this keeps my tresses soft, strong, silky and shiny. I don&#x27;t get breakage or split ends anymore. After I blow out my hair using this I have a hard time keeping my hands away from with my hair, so soft and smooth. I have been using this weekly for a year. It smells fantastic, like a bakery full of cupcakes. This container lasts me several months and the price on Amazon is less than what I pay in any salon and the product quality is exactly the same.  I don&#x27;t recommend using it more than weekly as you can get build up from excessive use. I do use purple toning shampoo and this removes any styling buildup from my hair. If you are needing some TLC for your locks than try this as it has changed my hair into healthy strong tresses!</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this stuff. I have been doing keratin treatments in my hair for the past 5 years and for the first time I tried an hombre. I like it but it dried my hair out a lot so I tried this and it brought the life back to my hair quickly!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Keratin Repair Reconstruct.  I needed something to use to deep condition and strengthen my damaged hair.  After just one use I could see and feel the difference.  My hair felt stronger but soft at the same time and it smells wonderful.  I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and this was a great product for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! Not only does it work well, but it smells absolutely amazing!!</li>
    <li> Great deep conditioning. I used this product about one every 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff on the market and I have tried a lot of products both salon and home made. I bleach my dark hair white then stain it blue. I have very long hair and have to take very good care of it. I have done this for many years. It works great after being left on for 5 minutes, however I will sometime leave it on over night for deep repair. I also recommend the leave in fast food conditioner.</li>
    <li> I just used this yesterday for the first time...I just left it on for like 5 mins (after shampoo) My hair is so amazing soft and shiny......absolutely a great conditioner for dry hair!!!!</li>
    <li> I like it, but honestly don&#x27;t need more than their light conditioner</li>
    <li> Best. Thing. Ever... I have coarse, loose curls. I use this for deep condition, leave in condition, and everything in between. Thanks Amazon for offering at a fraction of the salon price!</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask, it really helped restore my damaged hair....looks like I got a hair cut because all my split ends were gone. I also Love AG Colour Savour shampoo and Conditioner. I talk about AG products in my Blog posts all the time.[...]</li>
