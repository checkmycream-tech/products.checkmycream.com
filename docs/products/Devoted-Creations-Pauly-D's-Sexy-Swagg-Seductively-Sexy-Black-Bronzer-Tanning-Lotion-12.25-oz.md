      <li>This lotion is amazing.</li>
      <li>If you own a home tanning bed, this is the tanning solution you need.</li>
      <li>love the tattoo protectant since I have alot of nice peices</li>
      <li>Would recommend it to anyone interested in getting some great color.</li>
      <li>Plus it smells kind of strong.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice now, just started tanning, and I love it</li>
      <li>but it is most definitely my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
      <li>and I figured I could get a better deal online..</li>
      <li>This lotion made my hands orange and the after smell is gross I like brown sugar best out of all the lotions</li>
      <li>I had used a sample sexy swagg at my tanning salon and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S A GREAT TAN LOTION &amp; SMELLS VERY</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>glad I made the purchase, shipped and delivered on time.</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on well and smells ok.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite lotion</li>
      <li>Love it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Way cheaper than buying in tan salon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so far I&#x27;m already getting a good tan with it!</li>
      <li>but it does have a mild brozing agent that builds an amazing caramel color over time, keywords being over time</li>
      <li>THIS LOTION HAS A GREAT SMELL AND MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SOFT.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it even if it was free.</li>
      <li>This lotion gives great color, especially on my arms since they don&#x27;t tan all that well.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell goes on evenly, and works fast.</li>
      <li>when I started tanning I was using a tanning lotion that was cheap.</li>
      <li>It also smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>I think everyone should read description on bottle to make sure it&#x27;s right for you</li>
      <li>I expected more of it because of all the good rating and because of the name.</li>
      <li>I have used other Pauly D products I&#x27;ve liked much better.</li>
      <li>I have been using all different kinds of tanning products but Pauly D&#x27;s Sexy Swagg is by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>It looked to me like the person selling it might have bought it discounted, used all the real lotion and filled the bottle with some kind of regular lotion.</li>
      <li>The smell is great and endures the heat of a tanning bed, so even if you perspire a little you&#x27;ll still be pretty fresh.</li>
      <li>I purchased a test packet from my salon and LOVED the scent and the way the lotion was not too dark and &amp;#34;bronzy.&amp;#34; I avoided purchasing at the salon being that the lotion was $60</li>
      <li>I still achieved a good  tan but as soon as I received my Pauly d sexy swag in the mail I used it and noticed a dramatic difference after just one use.</li>
      <li>Will plan to get more next year!</li>
      <li>I just purchased this lotion a few weeks ago, I love it!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a nice dark tan!</li>
      <li>I got it fast and</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need too much of it either</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it after I tan.</li>
      <li>I just didn&#x27;t get much from it.</li>
      <li>Honestly just the way it smells makes me want to use it as my everyday lotion</li>
      <li>When I ordered this product I was out of the one I had currently been using and this arrived much faster than it originally said it would</li>
      <li>You might at well just buy a cheap regular daily lotion at Walmart and use it because I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same thing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few weeks and love it.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion for a few reasons.</li>
      <li>I usually tan pretty easy, whenever I ordered it I had high hopes of it making me tan.</li>
      <li>It comes in a pretty pink bottle but thats the only thing that&#x27;s ok, In other words this new  \\&quot;Pauly\\</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my daughter, and so far she has no comments about the product..</li>
      <li>I like it because you dont get the orange color to your hands or feet and it helps keep my skin soft.</li>
      <li>Ive only used it twice, but so far I DO NOT like it.</li>
      <li>Less expensive than the same great product found in professional tanning salons.  </li>

<li> When using i didn&#x27;t notice results right away like other bronzers I have used in the past but it does help my tan.</li>
<li> On to a better lotion! :(</li>

<li> I usually have a problem with bronzes in lotions bc</li>
<li> Not sure...</li>
<li> The after tan smell is decent and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that bad after tan smell that some lotions give you.</li>
<li> &quot;  lotion  sucks!</li>
<li> Do not waste your time with this lotion, It goes on so think and stinks so bad.</li>
<li> I was wrong.</li>
<li> It has no bronzer in it which is how I can tell it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
<li> Needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller again and nor will I buy lotion off of Amazon!</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I just purchased this lotion a few weeks ago, I love it! I usually have a problem with bronzes in lotions bc they streak, this one doesn&#x27;t! I saw immediate results, and doesn&#x27;t give you an orange look, it&#x27;s a nice dark tan!</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product to start out with when you begin tanning. I use it year round. Like this product</li>
    <li> Not sure... I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it after I tan. Plus it smells kind of strong. I won&#x27;t be getting this again</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I was out of the one I had currently been using and this arrived much faster than it originally said it would</li>
    <li> Got this produce for my bestie as a gift and she loved it, glad I made the purchase, shipped and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S A GREAT TAN LOTION &amp; SMELLS VERY GOOD!!!&lt;br /&gt;IT MET MY EXPECTATIONS AND I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It has a nice smell goes on evenly, and works fast. I purchase this repeatedly.</li>
    <li> It comes in a pretty pink bottle but thats the only thing that&#x27;s ok, In other words this new  \\&quot;Pauly\\&quot;  lotion  sucks! It simply does Not do the job. I used it a few times and don&#x27;t see a tan at all, it&#x27;s wack &amp; not worth paying for, as a matter of fact I wouldn&#x27;t use it even if it was free. BiG mistake in purchasing it! On to a better lotion! :(</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. My hairstylist recommended it to me and its everything she told me. Still seeing results and it still smells amazing after you get out of the bed.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for a few reasons. The smell is great and endures the heat of a tanning bed, so even if you perspire a little you&#x27;ll still be pretty fresh. The lotion comes out white but it does have a mild brozing agent that builds an amazing caramel color over time, keywords being over time so you&#x27;re never left streaky or orange. No one should expect either a tanning lotion or tanning bed to make them dark in a day - that&#x27;s what spray tans are for. If you allow yourself a week or two to build your tan, this lotion is your BFF. After one use my skin was feeling softer. Honestly just the way it smells makes me want to use it as my everyday lotion but it is most definitely my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite lotion but I still would buy this again. When using i didn&#x27;t notice results right away like other bronzers I have used in the past but it does help my tan. I like it because you dont get the orange color to your hands or feet and it helps keep my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I usually tan pretty easy, whenever I ordered it I had high hopes of it making me tan. Ive only used it twice, but so far I DO NOT like it. When I got it the color of the lotion was basically white. I will not buy this again. I expected more of it because of all the good rating and because of the name.</li>
    <li> Works well got a great tan ! Will plan to get more next year!</li>
    <li> thought it would have a bronzer in it but it didnt and it has taken longer to get tan&lt;br /&gt;was everything it was supposed to be and the bottle looks llike its description just missing the&lt;br /&gt;bronzer</li>
    <li> Great pricing. Not my fave smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using all different kinds of tanning products but Pauly D&#x27;s Sexy Swagg is by far my favorite! Amazing Smell and bronzing without the orange tint...</li>
    <li> On time and great quality! I 100% recommend it! Also good price for the quality. I&#x27;m 100% satisfied! I give it 5 stars</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Way cheaper than buying in tan salon.&lt;br /&gt;I love the tattoo protectant since I have alot of nice peices and I didn&#x27;t pay all that money for the beautiful work I have gotten done to fade. It&#x27;s great gives you great color!&lt;br /&gt;Love love love!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion made my hands orange and the after smell is gross I like brown sugar best out of all the lotions</li>
    <li> I purchased a test packet from my salon and LOVED the scent and the way the lotion was not too dark and &amp;#34;bronzy.&amp;#34; I avoided purchasing at the salon being that the lotion was $60 and I figured I could get a better deal online.. I was wrong. Granted this lotion was only like $15 but it was the biggest waste. It took forever to arrive and when it did the lotion comes out almost white. It has no bronzer in it which is how I can tell it&#x27;s a fake. You might at well just buy a cheap regular daily lotion at Walmart and use it because I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the same thing. It looked to me like the person selling it might have bought it discounted, used all the real lotion and filled the bottle with some kind of regular lotion. Needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller again and nor will I buy lotion off of Amazon!</li>
    <li> when I started tanning I was using a tanning lotion that was cheap. I still achieved a good  tan but as soon as I received my Pauly d sexy swag in the mail I used it and noticed a dramatic difference after just one use. Instead of the tan I had I got a caramel color that I loved!!</li>
    <li> The lotion goes on well and smells ok. I just didn&#x27;t get much from it. I have used other Pauly D products I&#x27;ve liked much better.</li>
    <li> I got it fast and way cheaper then the tanning salon I use has it for. It smells great and you don&#x27;t need too much of it either</li>
    <li> Less expensive than the same great product found in professional tanning salons.  If you own a home tanning bed, this is the tanning solution you need.</li>
    <li> THIS LOTION HAS A GREAT SMELL AND MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SOFT. IT GIVES ME A GREAT TAN COLOR.  I RECOMMEND THIS LOTION IT IS A GREAT BUY</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. It also smells fantastic. I have always been unsure about buying anything that had to do with the Jersey Shore until my sister in law had a lotion. I had used a sample sexy swagg at my tanning salon and fell in love with it. This lotion gives great color, especially on my arms since they don&#x27;t tan all that well. The after tan smell is decent and doesn&#x27;t leave you with that bad after tan smell that some lotions give you. I would defiantly buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a few weeks and love it. My tan noticably darkened in a few days. I have a tendency to get orange.... but do not have that problem with this lotion. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your time with this lotion, It goes on so think and stinks so bad. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Got really dark with this and skin was so soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now, just started tanning, and I love it so far I&#x27;m already getting a good tan with it! Plus I&#x27;m all tatted so the tattoo fade protection is a big plus!</li>
    <li> nice smell, good results..</li>
    <li> Tans good. No smell. Good brown color.  Make you feel like your tan like jersey shore crew. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST lotion ever. Regarding the color,  it&#x27;s suppose to be white. There are no brokers in it but things to stimulate your tan. I think everyone should read description on bottle to make sure it&#x27;s right for you</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter, and so far she has no comments about the product.. so go for it.</li>
    <li> Lotion smells great and leaves a nice bronze tan instead of an orange color like some lotions. Would recommend it to anyone interested in getting some great color.</li>
    <li> Fastest shipping ever! Just ordered this 4 days ago and already got it. Smells amazing,can&#x27;t wait to use it</li>
