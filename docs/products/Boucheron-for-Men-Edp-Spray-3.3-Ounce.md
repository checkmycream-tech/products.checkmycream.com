    <li> I seem to smell a little bid less than the original bottle frm Bloomingdales?!</li>
    <li> Love this classic scent on my partner</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of my most favorite fragrances in the world.  It is a dressy fragrance, one that should be worn at night, preferable in the fall and winter.  It combines well with the warm smell of burning wood or even a cigarette.  Of course those are purely optional, as I no longer smoke.  There is a magic here that works and lives in the fragrance.  It fits well in a bistro, a three Michelin Star restaurant or any lounge or night club.  It is not a timid fragrance, however, it does not overwhelm the senses, it enhances them, making the sensations bolder, and yet warmly comfortable, like your favorite winter coat or the comfortable embrace of a new friend in familiar surroundings.  This is what the night is all about and another reason to love fall and winter.  See you in St. Moritz.  I&#x27;ll be the one by the fire with a cognac and cloaked in warmth of the fragrance called Boucheron.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Can in record time from a fantastic seller. I also savedover sixty dollars from retail stores. I have worn this Eau De Parfum for years and it always stops the opposite sex in their tracks and makes them ask, &amp;#34;oh my God, you smell fantastic, what are you wearing?&amp;#34; Thanks Boucheron.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this since my college days back in the 80&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;what more can be said, its truly a classic, especially for the night&lt;br /&gt;1 Large bottle will last a full year with daily use.</li>
    <li> They kept insisting that it was not their problem, &amp;#34;it is Amazon&amp;#34; problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion was not to spend another minute of my time &amp;#34;talking logic&amp;#34; with these people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to pay the bill and never purchase from Amazon any more.  They could simply solve the problem by crediting me the diference (about $16.00).</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised, real Eau de parfum same as Nordstrom.</li>
    <li> Lush and concupiscent scent with the allure and romance of a moonlight garden.  I used it mostly in the evening or in social settings</li>
    <li> Not as good as the ones bought at Dillards.  They smell different.</li>
    <li> Boucheron is the best i youths for years</li>
    <li> I had run out of Boucheron Eau De Parfum Spray, which I&#x27;ve used for years (with many compliments); found it on Amazon;  it is exactly what I wanted and expected.  If you&#x27;re looking for a men&#x27;s cologne/parfum I highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s not easy to find, and it&#x27;s great stuff.  Absolutely no issues with ordering and delivery.</li>
    <li> The best dry down of ant men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> Just received the Eau De Toilette instead of Eau De Parfum. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> My  wife really likes it just as I do. First purchased it on the Islands St Croix</li>
    <li> The quality of the product wasn&#x27;t nearly the same as others I have purchased. The scent doesn&#x27;t smell the same and it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> The best male fragrance ever!!!</li>
    <li> it was an excellent present and it has a very good price i totally recomend it for gentelmen middle age</li>
    <li> There are only to colones that I will wear and this is one of them!</li>
    <li> My favorite and always the best price here</li>
    <li> Smells like it is somehow spoiled.</li>
    <li> If you wear this scent, women will hunt you down like a pack of bloodhounds after a prison escape...</li>
    <li> I was surprised and pleased. It was exactly what I wanted.  I will use this site again and refer it to others.  Thanks</li>
