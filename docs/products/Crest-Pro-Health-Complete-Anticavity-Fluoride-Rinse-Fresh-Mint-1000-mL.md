      <li>First off, It made my mouth feel really fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>rarely drink coffee and after a week of using this i started noticing brown spots on the inside of my teeth and between my front teeth.</li>
      <li>I am so upset right now that this mouthwash could be the culprit.</li>
      <li>I liked ACT&#x27;s higher percentage of fluoride and the taste is similar.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Crest Pro Health Invigorating Clean for a long time now and decided to try this one to see if it was any better.</li>
      <li>This is pure poison!</li>
      <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
      <li>My tongue was also sensitive, as if it had been lightly burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never consider using this product again, and I advise everyone I know against it.</li>
      <li>So I looked up the reviews on this mouth wash and found many people experiencing the same thing.  </li>
      <li>Im getting married in 2 months</li>
      <li>I have been using this for 3 days, first 2</li>
      <li>At the first sign of discolouration quit using it and try something else.</li>
      <li>like I did after using this exact product.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now, and I haven&#x27;t been able to taste anything for several days.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this mouthwash because it is alcohol free, and I used it for a few days with great results as far as a long lasting fresh taste in my mouth, no burning during use, and really clean feeling teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is the &amp;#34;germ-killing action,&amp;#34; or if my mouth is just more sensitive than most.</li>
      <li>and it is gentle on the mouth</li>
      <li>I recommend proceeding very cautiously.  </li>
      <li>After using this for about a year, I&#x27;ve been put back on the 6-month plan, and I&#x27;m excited</li>
      <li>However, after 3 days, I developed a feeling that I had just burned my tongue on something really hot</li>
      <li>and I am not sure if I will even go back to to the Pro Health Invigorating Clean until I do a bit more investigating into the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Before my teeth cleaning I had brown stains which my dental hygenist said was due to a very strong mouthwash that I had to use from some Oral surgery that I had last year.</li>
      <li>During my teeth cleaning, the dental assistant said that some people were allergic to the whitening agent in these new mouth washes,so I stopped using Crest Pro Health.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s even gentle enough for my older children to use as well.</li>
      <li>The only thing different was the use of this mouthwash, and when I googled to see if that was a side effect others have suffered, I saw it was pretty widespread!  </li>
      <li>I am pregnant and am having inflamed gums due to pregnancy, and this seemed to be helping.  </li>
      <li>surprised as his ortho had recommended...</li>
      <li>However, the adverse effects far outweighed the benefits.</li>
      <li>My 13 year old like this because it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
      <li>So, I have stopped using it, and it has been two days so far.  </li>
      <li>but it is very challaging to open</li>
      <li>I purchased Crest Pro-Health Complete over a year ago.</li>
      <li>, I had ulcers and an infection developed around my tooth.</li>
      <li>I feel like I should get a free extra teeth cleaning due to</li>

      <li>He has stopped using the mouthwash and the color of his teeth are getting back to normal</li>
      <li>After reading some of the other reviews, I am positive that this mouthwash was the culprit(it was the only new addition to my routine).</li>
      <li>I can smell but just barely.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t smoke, I don&#x27;t drink alcohol or coke or coffee, I am only 20 years old and despite this my teeth look like I&#x27;ve been smoking for YEARS.</li>
      <li>so I borrowed some of my son&#x27;s Listerine Complete about 4 weeks ago and immediately began noticing the same thing - brown stains and gum swelling.</li>
      <li>so I panicked a little and looked up reviews related to crest prohealth and found that MANY other people have had their teeth turn brown from this  mouthwash.</li>
      <li>This leaves blue staining material on the tongue no matter how little or how much you rinse it in your mouth.</li>
      <li>My ability to taste sweet, sour, umami, and bitter were replaced with a dull metallic flavor, as if instead of eating food I was chewing on a stainless steel fork.</li>

<li> To me its not a strong flavor and does not burn.  </li>
<li> Only thing I can taste is sour and that is quite faint.</li>
<li> The first time I used it, I should have known that it was bad.</li>
<li> I am feeling quite frustrated right now and my next cleaning isn&#x27;t until August..... :(</li>
<li> My gums bled and I spit out strings of blue, afterwards my tongue was numb.</li>
<li> The brown stains continued to get worse.  </li>
<li> Im annoyed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i do not know if this the new kind of bottle  but it is very challaging to open</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash. It gets the job done and then some--and it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth in the process.</li>
    <li> The crest pro health I&#x27;d an OK product #GotItFree bye being a bzzagent it was weird in my mouth not for me</li>
    <li> I used this ONE time the evening of June 19th 2015 and when I woke up the next morning the underside of my jaw was really hurting, I have a disgusting metallic taste in my mouth that won&#x27;t go away, I feel like I&#x27;m producing too much saliva and the underside of my tongue is painful and peeling!! This is pure poison! Absolutely DO NOT USE THIS TRASH! It is June 22nd 2015 and these issues are still bothering me. I have never had a bad reaction to any product I&#x27;ve ever purchased before this toxic mess! I dumped it down the drain and I&#x27;m never using any Crest product ever again in my life! How this stuff is STILL on the market after hundreds of negative reviews stating it causes a number of oral health problems is INSANE! I would sooner rinse my mouth with muddy water than this! Please do not use this!</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash.  Cleans well and is does not have a strong alcohol taste</li>
    <li> Great product. Great taste and lasts. Only draw back is it clings to the sink so washing is a must with a cloth instead of with a quick rinse.</li>
    <li> stained my sons teeth horrible brown, amazingly awful!  surprised as his ortho had recommended...but our dentist confirmed the staining...</li>
    <li> best rinse.&lt;br /&gt;period</li>
    <li> Leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this mouthwash because it is alcohol free, and I used it for a few days with great results as far as a long lasting fresh taste in my mouth, no burning during use, and really clean feeling teeth and gums.  I am pregnant and am having inflamed gums due to pregnancy, and this seemed to be helping.  However, after 3 days, I developed a feeling that I had just burned my tongue on something really hot and I lost my ability to taste anything.  The only thing different was the use of this mouthwash, and when I googled to see if that was a side effect others have suffered, I saw it was pretty widespread!  So, I have stopped using it, and it has been two days so far.  I still cannot taste anything, but the burning feeling is getting better.  The positives of this mouthwash could not outweigh the loss of ability to taste my food, so it is going in the garbage :(</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE! I used this product one time and it burned the inside of my mouth.  My tounge lost its sense of taste and the inside of my cheeks burned and got full of sores.  Pieces of flesh ripped off inside my mouth! I called poison control because the burning wouldn&#x27;t stop hours after use.  Please save yourself the nightmare this product caused me.  I wish I would have read the reviews prior to use! This product is dangerouse!</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews and I just couldn&#x27;t believe there could be much wrong with a mouthwash.  I was wrong!  My husband used this mouthwash for four days, twice a day and had noticeable brown staining on his teeth.  He would also wake up about a half hour after falling asleep with mouth pain.  He has stopped using the mouthwash and the color of his teeth are getting back to normal but he still has the mouth pain.  We have read other reviews/complaints about this mouthwash and apparently it can take up to two weeks for the pain to subside.  Believe the reviews.  Don&#x27;t buy this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Crest Pro Health Invigorating Clean for a long time now and decided to try this one to see if it was any better. After two days of using the product, the glands near my right jaw became extremely swollen(to the point where it was painful to eat and painful to the touch). After reading some of the other reviews, I am positive that this mouthwash was the culprit(it was the only new addition to my routine). I will be dumping the rest of this product out when I get home and I am not sure if I will even go back to to the Pro Health Invigorating Clean until I do a bit more investigating into the ingredients. Bottom line, I agree with the other reviews that are similar to this, double check the ingredients on the bottle.</li>
    <li> After hearing such rave reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try. Well, I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now, and I haven&#x27;t been able to taste anything for several days. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the &amp;#34;germ-killing action,&amp;#34; or if my mouth is just more sensitive than most. It feels like my mouth has been burned, and I&#x27;m probably going to return this product and get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to other customers.</li>
    <li> Used this mouthwash since it debuted and it still is my favorite one.</li>
    <li> My teeth are horribly stained after the use of this product. I look like a smoker. My teeth are brown and look like they are rotting. I am appalled that this product is on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know for a fact that this product caused the change in my teeth. I brush and floss daily and have never had any cavities. I have never had oversensitive gums go to the dentist about twice a year. My checkup this year was LAST MONTH and they were cleaned. I have never had any problems with my teeth. I have always had perfect teeth and cannot afford to go days without brushing- I&#x27;m uninsured!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference in my diet or lifestyle has been introducing this mouthwash into my daily dental care routine. The first time I used it, I should have known that it was bad. My gums bled and I spit out strings of blue, afterwards my tongue was numb. It burned terribly. I attributed it to the killing of germs and effectiveness- days went by and the burning sensation went away but am still left with numbness. I continued to use it but now my teeth are BROWN AND I am so done with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t smoke, I don&#x27;t drink alcohol or coke or coffee, I am only 20 years old and despite this my teeth look like I&#x27;ve been smoking for YEARS. And this is after using this product for about 2-3 WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product. I will be uploading pictures of my teeth.</li>
    <li> No alcohol. Has a lot of benefits and tastes ok for mouthwash. 6 Pack makes it convenient to use several times a day and not run out.</li>
    <li> I like this brand and the price is ght.</li>
    <li> I have now been using Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash twice a day for one week. I have already noticed a significant decrease in the plaque along my gum line and the morning breath is gone. I have not noticed the brown stains that other reviewers have mentioned.  I received this product for free as a BzzAgent but will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> After using this product for a week, rinsing once or twice a day, my tongue was stained black and my teeth about two shades darker.  When I stopped using it my tongue returned to normal in a week but the teeth staining seems more persistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would assign a zero star to this product if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging from the reviews, this problem is common but not universal.  If you want to try it I recommend proceeding very cautiously.  At the first sign of discolouration quit using it and try something else.</li>
    <li> This leaves blue staining material on the tongue no matter how little or how much you rinse it in your mouth. You have to scrape the residue off and the taste lingers in your mouth for hours.</li>
    <li> I purchased Crest Pro-Health Complete over a year ago. I too began noticing brown stains but assumed it was all the caffeine that I had been drinking.  However I later began to experience toothaches and gum swelling and irritation specifically around one of my back teeth.  I went to the dentist multiple times over this issue and x-rays could not really determine what was causing the pain.  They crowned one of my back teeth thinking that a cavity may have gotten worse and was affecting my other tooth. I spent $250+ (after insurance).  However I continued to have aches around my back teeth and gum irritation. The brown stains continued to get worse.  During my teeth cleaning, the dental assistant said that some people were allergic to the whitening agent in these new mouth washes,so I stopped using Crest Pro Health.So I bought a generic mouth wash. The gum irritation stopped, toothache went away and the stains began to subside.  I ran out of the generic mouth wash so I borrowed some of my son&#x27;s Listerine Complete about 4 weeks ago and immediately began noticing the same thing - brown stains and gum swelling. Well it got so bad, I had ulcers and an infection developed around my tooth. I ended up with a root canal and had to pay for another crown on that tooth (another $450 +). The dental assistant told me that many people have been complaining to her about Crest Pro Health.  So I looked up the reviews on this mouth wash and found many people experiencing the same thing.  This is horrible.  I will NEVER use Crest or Listerine products again!!!</li>
    <li> Nice refreshing after taste, doesn&#x27;t burn like Listerine... I would recommend to anyone...</li>
    <li> I used to go to the dentist every 4 months for check-ups. After using this for about a year, I&#x27;ve been put back on the 6-month plan, and I&#x27;m excited</li>
    <li> First off, It made my mouth feel really fresh and clean. (Like getting a cleaning from the Dentist office) However, the adverse effects far outweighed the benefits. I have been using this for 3 days, first 2 it was fine, 3rd day I woke up and couldn&#x27;t taste a thing. I can smell but just barely. Only thing I can taste is sour and that is quite faint. Horrible product and should be pulled from shelves immediately.</li>
    <li> I used this product for only 4 days. After using this product, as directed, I lost most of my taste sensation for 2 weeks straight. My ability to taste sweet, sour, umami, and bitter were replaced with a dull metallic flavor, as if instead of eating food I was chewing on a stainless steel fork. My tongue was also sensitive, as if it had been lightly burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never consider using this product again, and I advise everyone I know against it. The people at Crest do their brand a disservice by continuing to carry this product.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. I recommend it to anyone. You won&#x27;t regret it. Go for it. Thank You Crest co. I love it.</li>
    <li> using for the fluoride as recommended by the Dentist</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash - I have tried so many others in the past - has a great taste - lasts all day</li>
    <li> great price and a good product</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s funny that someone would say this is the best product ever...unless they didn&#x27;t get their teeth stained brown like I did after using this exact product. Ive always had white teeth...i dont smoke and dont drink pop..rarely drink coffee and after a week of using this i started noticing brown spots on the inside of my teeth and between my front teeth. Im getting married in 2 months so I panicked a little and looked up reviews related to crest prohealth and found that MANY other people have had their teeth turn brown from this  mouthwash. HOW are they allowed to sell this still?!? I read over the label before I bought it and didn&#x27;t find anything taht stood out so if there is a warning on there it shoudl be in bold letters &amp;#34;Your teeth may start to look like you&#x27;ve been chewing tobacco for years&amp;#34;. Im annoyed.</li>
    <li> I like the taste of this mouthwash. To me its not a strong flavor and does not burn.  I didn&#x27;t experience the bad things some other reviewers talk about and I am about half way through a 500 ml bottle.  I do get the blue stringy stuff when I spit, but I think that&#x27;s just mucus that got dyed blue.  I will probably try a different brand after this bottle.  I liked ACT&#x27;s higher percentage of fluoride and the taste is similar.</li>
    <li> good stuff and it is gentle on the mouth</li>
    <li> My teeth are so clean, and my breath is fresh after using Crest Pro-Health! I like that there is no alcohol and burning effects from the mouth wash, it&#x27;s even gentle enough for my older children to use as well. Thanks Crest!</li>
    <li> My 13 year old like this because it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!  I am suffering from the same thing other users are experiencing - BROWN STAINS!!!  I floss and use a sonicare.  I have never had issues with my teeth.  I purchased this mouthwash two weeks ago and now have brown stains on my teeth and sensitivity to cold.  Dumping this product down the drain.</li>
    <li> So glad I found these reviews. I had my teeth cleaned two months ago and they were beautifully white. Within a week I noticed brown stains! Before my teeth cleaning I had brown stains which my dental hygenist said was due to a very strong mouthwash that I had to use from some Oral surgery that I had last year. I was thrilled to see them looking so beautiful again! Now I feel like I am back to where I was and I have not been using the oral rinse from my surgeon, but Crest Pro-Health with fluoride at my hygenist&#x27;s recommendation! I am so upset right now that this mouthwash could be the culprit. I don&#x27;t smoke, drink minimal coffee, and even when I had my teeth cleaned last I asked if it was the coffee and my hygenist said no. I feel like I should get a free extra teeth cleaning due to this being a result of my hygenist&#x27;s recommendation. I am feeling quite frustrated right now and my next cleaning isn&#x27;t until August..... :(</li>
