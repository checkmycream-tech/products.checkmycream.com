      <li>(I&#x27;m still wondering why she thought I would care about her moisturizing duties, but she&#x27;s a good friend</li>

      <li>GOES ON SMOOTH, GREAT PROTECTION.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll describe what I liked about it and what didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
      <li>nice</li>
      <li>I purchased Neutrogena Healthy Defense with helioplex at the store because I thought that Neutrogena was known for good products.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be reordering this one in particular, but Neutrogena makes excellent products and I will be reordering a creamier version.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>The Neutrogena Healthy Defense Liquid SPF 50 is an excellent product that is especially good for your face in the hot and direct sun.  </li>
      <li>The SPF 50 makes it an excellent choice if you live somewhere sunny like I do.</li>
      <li>This is so reasonable, is good protection, doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen, and has a great texture/feel.</li>
      <li>Liquid moisturizer absorbs into your skin faster, therefore is more effective for up to 24 hours.</li>
      <li>SPF is so important and this is a good way to keep your face protected.</li>
      <li>i love it since it doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily, has a nice scent (with just a hint of sun block smell) and my makeup goes over it with no problem. :)</li>
      <li>Full spectrum sun protection and a good moisturizer to boot.</li>
      <li>Very light.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion, SPF 15, 2.5 Ounce (Pack of 2)]].&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
      <li>an this made my face feel more oily.</li>
      <li>I love Estee Lauder face cream</li>
      <li>Yes, even at my age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Olay, this is thinner, so it may seem like you&#x27;re using &#x27;more&#x27; of it to cover your face.</li>
      <li>I was very happy with Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I think if this had a better fragrance, and it had more moisturizer in it, I would convert.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more liquid--unlike Olay, it will run on your fingers.  </li>
      <li>love the package</li>
      <li>thing that most attracted me to it is the SPF50.  </li>
      <li>I prefer this product to many department store brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>If you want a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t thick then this is the best I&#x27;ve experienced.  </li>
      <li>I love the SPF in it.  </li>
      <li>Although I received this via the Amazon Vine program, I intend to purchase more when when I run out.</li>
      <li>I like to mix my moisturizer and foundation in my palm before applying to get more of a tinted moisturizer effect.  </li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
      <li>However, after using it this summer and fall, I love it.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena Healthy Defense Liquid Moisturizer</li>
      <li>with many of the creams I use (they all claim to be non-hypoallergenic).  </li>
      <li>I got this Neutrogena Healthy Defense Liquid Moisturizer Spf 50</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>so this moisturizer is pretty nice because I use it as sunscreen as well!</li>
      <li>REALLY GLAD</li>
      <li>I hope I&#x27;m getting great coverage, but it gives me too much shine in the summer.</li>
      <li>I think this is probably a good moisturizer, but it isn&#x27;t the right one for me for most days.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a senior, so I&#x27;ve been using very rich moisturizers for some years now to nourish my aging skin.  </li>
      <li>It has a high SPF of 50 which was great</li>
      <li>It is light, has a pleasant odor, and is absorbed easily without leaving a residue.</li>
      <li>My fault though too for not making sure it was fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more thoughtful than you know.  </li>
      <li>It provided a great sunscreen for her fair skin, and she said it was at least as effective as her creamy moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, absorbs quickly and well, lasts a good long while and has a great spf.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy, goes on easy.</li>
      <li>In conclusion, if you&#x27;re looking for a great sunblock you can use every day - this is the product for you, if you&#x27;re looking for just a moisturizer, you&#x27;d be better off buying a different product.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t clog pores, it&#x27;s liquid and goes on easily.  </li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>I bought this product because of the high SPF and because Neutrogena is usually good for any skin type.  </li>
      <li>It is nothing like suntan lotion, it goes on really easy and smooth</li>
      <li>but my skin was fine.</li>
      <li>A test of 2-3 hours in the sun turned out fine - no burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is great, I&#x27;ve been using it on my face pretty much every day for a couple of years now.  </li>
      <li>It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.  </li>
      <li>this works great as my daily moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>We all know how important sunscreen is, we hear about it in the news and from our doctors all the time.  </li>
      <li>This product is great and Amazon is the only place where we can find it.  </li>
      <li>I have med-dry skin and still feel it provides moisture, even with what feels like a light coverage.  </li>
      <li>It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy looking sheen on your face and appears to keep the rays off.</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re wearing with a light powder or matte makeup over it your face will shine, shine, shine.  </li>
      <li>This Neutrogena moisturizer is very lightweight and not greasy at all, which is great because I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts.</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t too excited over this.</li>
      <li>I purchased this at a discount store I believe (which led me to believe it was  being discontinued), and at first, I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the &#x27;liquid&#x27; formula.  </li>
      <li>It does moisturize and smells great but gave my skin a slick, more teenagery look than I care for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Estee Lauder face cream so I wasn&#x27;t too excited over this. It does moisturize and smells great but gave my skin a slick, more teenagery look than I care for. I was afraid it might make me break out because it felt greasy but my skin was fine. It would be good as a back up but I&#x27;ll stick to my Estee.</li>
    <li> I normally use the Oil of Olay for sensitive skin, because I am the breakout QUEEN. Yes, even at my age!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Olay, this is thinner, so it may seem like you&#x27;re using &#x27;more&#x27; of it to cover your face. It&#x27;s more liquid--unlike Olay, it will run on your fingers.  It spreads smoothly and gets absorbed rapidly. You don&#x27;t have to wait before applying the rest of your makeup (in my case, just face powder).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I find weird about this stuff is you have to shake the bottle up before using it.  It&#x27;s not a bad thing, just something that if you&#x27;re not doing, may seem a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not fond of the perfumey scent, but it fades very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, I am breakout prone, yes, but this has not given me one breakout. Not even close.  Very nice stuff!</li>
    <li> This was decent as a sunscreen since it has a decent SPF, and as a moisturizer wasn&#x27;t so bad either.  It&#x27;s not great as a stand-alone moisturizer, though, and I&#x27;d suggest using another moisturizer for your regular moisturizing, though this is fine if you&#x27;re going to be out in the sun for a while.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has made a great combination product. It is light, has a pleasant odor, and is absorbed easily without leaving a residue. Makeup goes on to of this non oily product very easily and it seems to last all day with one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a product I could use every day without worry as it leave my face - and fingers - feeling clean and soft after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it seems a little more expensive than other sunscreens for your face, it does go a long way and the daily cost is low at pennies a day. Well worth the protection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also unlike other sunscreens I have not had any rash on my skin, or burning in my eyes that often comes with sunscreen getting into your eyes on a hot humid day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus of the small size, it fits in a purse and is under the size requirements for secuirty checks at the airport.</li>
    <li> I really wish I had more to say about this product.  It is very light and not thick and \\&quot;goopy\\&quot;, seems to protect well enough from the sun, thought I rarely allow myself to be exposed to the sun for any length of time.  There is no heavy scent and it doesn&#x27;t take time for the liquid to be absorbed by the skin.</li>
    <li> The first time I applied this product it gave my skin a shiny, oily appearance. I waited 20 minutes and it still had a bright shiny wet look, so I washed my face. When the soap hit my fact it stung. When I dried my skin had red blotches and it still had a shiny appearance. I applied my regular moisturizing lotion to soothe my skin but it continued to sting. Two days later my face is peeling as though I received a bad sunburn.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer with SPF is light, for an American style sunscreen.  It has a very milky-liquid consistency and goes on smoothly and evenly.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have the same matifying effect that many Japanese sunscreens have and can end up looking a bit shiny if you don&#x27;t blot it halfway through the day.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this as a daily moisturizer and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have oily feeling skin an this made my face feel more oily.</li>
    <li> Way, way too much fragrance.  I cannot use it on my face. I am using it on my hands!  Disappointed!!!  My fault though too for not making sure it was fragrance free.  Neutrogena usually is fragrance free or at least not this overpowering fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently decided that it&#x27;s time to start protecting my face against uv radiation.  I have tried many products for that purpose and none of them absorbed very well on my skin, I&#x27;ve had problems with it drying and leaving a white residue or making my face look shiny and oily.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that within 2-5 minutes absorbs completely and leaves no trace.  Now this is a dual action product - it&#x27;s also supposed to moisturize, now in that department I&#x27;ve had better - but again the good thing here is the absorption - it absorbs in your skin and you don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like a moisturizer really...    In conclusion, if you&#x27;re looking for a great sunblock you can use every day - this is the product for you, if you&#x27;re looking for just a moisturizer, you&#x27;d be better off buying a different product.</li>
    <li> Just got back from skiing - this worked well for high altitude sun exposure, though I did seem to get more color than I wanted one day when I forgot to bring it with me and didn&#x27;t reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thin consistency applies well, not greasy feeling at all.  The scent is mild - somewhat like soap.  A gender neutral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost seems a bit high, but since you don&#x27;t use much on your face, I&#x27;d think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I used this for several weeks before reviewing to see how I liked it, and I do like it.  It&#x27;s not greasy, feels and smells nice, and helped my very dry skin.  When the samples  are used up, I will buy the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not heavily into moisturizers, but sunscreen definitely. As a redhead I have roughly zero tolerance for UV radiation. I&#x27;ve used products with a  high SPF before, and the SPF of 50 for this one caught my eye. Unlike the usual lotion products I&#x27;ve used previously, the Neutrogena product does not come out like a heavy cream - instead it&#x27;s a liquid. (It requires shaking before application.) It goes on very easily and without the mess of thicker products. I suspect it will also go farther - I didn&#x27;t need to apply as much to get an even coating. A test of 2-3 hours in the sun turned out fine - no burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now whether to treat this as a moisturizer that also blocks the sun, or a sun blocker that also moisturizes is a matter of personal preference. It definitely blocked the sun for me which is what I was looking for.  Good enough!</li>
    <li> I think this is probably a good moisturizer, but it isn&#x27;t the right one for me for most days.  I&#x27;ll describe what I liked about it and what didn&#x27;t work for me and you can decide whether it is going to be right for you or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that most attracted me to it is the SPF50.  No one talked about sun damage when I was young and getting a tan was all important.  I still usually forget to put on sun screen so using a moisturizer with a high SPF is the best way to make sure I have some sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used different types of moisturizers (creams, gels, lotions) but never one quite like this one.  You shake the bottle before using it -- there is a ball of something inside that mixes the contents.  It is a liquid sort of like milk but really really white and it goes on very thinly so it wouldn&#x27;t be thick under makeup. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients list includes fragrance but I didn&#x27;t notice it and am usually quite sensitive to fragrances in cosmetics so it must be very subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is why I&#x27;ve decided to use this moisturizer only when I don&#x27;t wear makeup.  I like to mix my moisturizer and foundation in my palm before applying to get more of a tinted moisturizer effect.  Because this is a liquid, it doesn&#x27;t mix well with my cream foundation and I will stick to [[ASIN:B00125CZE6 Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer SPF 45 - 1.7 oz.]] for when I need to wear makeup.  If you want a very thin moisturizer to wear underneath foundation or when not wearing makeup, this might work for you.</li>
    <li> This is the first non-greasy moisturizer with an SPF of 50 I&#x27;ve ever found! I wash my face, use a thicker moisturizer and then as the last step before I put on makeup I use this stuff. It works really well because it&#x27;s so light! I&#x27;ve had no breakout issues. In fact my skin has gotten clearer because this moisturizer keeps the sun away which causes breakouts for me. I just love this stuff!</li>
    <li> ...in light blue letters are the words \\&quot;liquid moisturizer\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what this is: liquid. Very light, definitely runny with some spreadability issues, none of which I like or benefit my skin. I won&#x27;t be reordering this one in particular, but Neutrogena makes excellent products and I will be reordering a creamier version.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget: SPF always.</li>
    <li> Works well under makeup, b/c it&#x27;s thin, not greasy. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this in full sun for several hours, but for a city sunscreen, it does its job. I&#x27;m prone to breakouts, but my skin has tolerated this formula. Makeup looks balanced, not cakey or greasy. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Just put one of these into your next order and give it to your wife.     It&#x27;s more thoughtful than you know.  It says, \\&quot;I bought you the good stuff.  You&#x27;re beautiful and deserve the best.  I don&#x27;t want you to get skin cancer.\\&quot;      Not greasy.  Not dry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup or have a complicated skin care routine. However, with much of my work outdoors, I do want to protect my face from UV damage. Almost all other facial sunscreens are SPF 15 or so-- hardly enough to get me through a day of mowing and gardening. I really like that the product is so thin that I feel like I have nothing on, plus a high enough SPF that I can stay out longer. It doesn&#x27;t drip down into your eyes with sweat and sting like most other high-SPF products and doesn&#x27;t aggravate acne. Even the bottle size is great for travel. A must-have if you spend a lot of time outdoors and want to protect the skin on your face with a higher SPF that won&#x27;t sting your eyes.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Healthy Defense Liquid Moisturizer SPF50 - The manufacturer&#x27;s claim that this is an ultralight liquid certainly holds true.  Despite the SPF50, this moisturizer does not feel heavy, and does not clog pores. It keeps the dry patches on my face moisturized all day, yet oily patches don&#x27;t turn into a greasy mess.  I have sensitive skin with some rosacea, and this moisturizer does not irritate at all.  It provides a nice base, and my liquid foundation goes on smoothly over this moisturizer.  The first day I wore this, I actually received a compliment from a co-worker on how nice I looked, but she couldn&#x27;t put her finger on exactly what was different.  The biggest test of the SPF quality is my one-hour commute to work each day, in a sunny climate.  Since I normally wear SPF30 daily, I can say that as a sunscreen, this moisturizer works just as well as any SPF30 I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I have not put it to the challenge of longer periods in full sun, so can&#x27;t really comment on how well it performs as SPF50.   I normally avoid chemical sunscreens, but after giving this one a try, I find myself reaching for it every morning before applying my foundation.  Although I received this via the Amazon Vine program, I intend to purchase more when when I run out.</li>
    <li> Usually I use the Neutrogena Healthy Defense SPF 50 for sensitive skin. This time I tried it with helioplex and it irritated my skin. Guess my skin is still sensitive. Back to the one without helioplex!</li>
    <li> I liked the fact that this protects my skin from the sun, and I liked the fact that it is so thin. When you put it on, it really doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on. On the other hand, it doesn&#x27;t really feel like a moisturizer either. I have always used Oil of Olay, but that is very expensive. I think if this had a better fragrance, and it had more moisturizer in it, I would convert.</li>
    <li> How could anyone be allergic to a Neutrogena product?  I am not sure.. but I am!  My skin developed a raised and itchy rash all over the area where I used this-so I had to discontinue.  I smoothed benedryl creme on my face before going to bed and that took care of the rash.  But I tried-used this for 4-5 days.  Face itched and burned every single day.</li>
    <li> For a trip to the beach, this would be a great product. However, as an everyday moisturizer, it is not pleasant to apply, it takes a while for the white lotion to rub in and disappear, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like my face is as moisturized as with other products.     My skin stings a little under my eyes when I apply this, too.    I would recommend this only for days in the sun. For office days and other inside days, I prefer Olay Regenerist serum that has an SPF of 15.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena moisturizer for years, but since 30 is coming up fast I figured anti-aging and sunblock would be a great move. Wrong. I tried this product and after 2 days my skin was sore under my eyes. I thought I might have scrubbed my makeup too hard. Within 5 days I was on the phone with their 800 number because my face was dried out, bright red, peeling, sore and had obviously chemical burns. I was forced to not wash my face for 5 days and put on layers and layers of my old moisturizer for relief. The drying near my eyes made it look like I have crows feet and the blotchy skin made me self-concious when helping customers. I have to re-apply moisturizer several times a day to keep the flaking skin at bay so it doesn&#x27;t look like my face is coming off. I have no idea what caused this, but there are 3 kinds of acid in this formula so now I have learned my lesson and will spot test before jumping into a new product. I have never reacted to any products in my life until now.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin and this works great as my daily moisturizer.  I wear it under full foundation and I&#x27;ve never had any issue with the foundation moving around.  It is very moisturizing, but not so heavy that I can&#x27;t wear it in the summer.  I love the SPF in it.  I prefer this product to many department store brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I am always leery of trying facial moisturizers and creams as in the past I have tried some brands and on applying my foundation the sunscreen just rolls off.  Not this one...it goes on light and not heavy and I have no trouble applying my foundation over it.  I also love that is has Helioplex in it which is a great addition to this product.</li>
    <li> I like to use a moisturizer under my eyes and on my neck each day. I was very happy with Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer. It has a high SPF of 50 which was great and I didn&#x27;t need very much each day. It goes on easily and is simple to rub in. I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with it spreading and getting into my eyes and stinging or anything. It doesn&#x27;t leave a shine either. I feel it does a good job moisturizing and am very comfortable using this each morning after I shower. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I know everyone is different and someone else may not have this issue, but this moisturizer made me breakout. I am in my late twenties and have never had too much of a problem with acne, until I started to use this product a few months ago. I did not realize what the cause of the breakout was at first and I spent quite a bit of money on different products to treat the problem, with only mild success. Once I realized that the acne problem began around the time that I started to use this product, I threw it away and saw an almost immediate improvement! I have used other Neutrogena moisturizers in the past without experiencing this problem, so I am not counting the brand out completely. However, I would definitely NOT recommend this particular product.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer seems a bit thick (not the disappearing type) for me.  I tried it for under the sun, really can&#x27;t tell about the SPF 50 part.  My wife seem to like it but since there&#x27;s really isn&#x27;t any scent, she doesn&#x27;t use it often.  I kind of have a little allergic reaction to it after I put it on and go under the sun.  The skin on my hand and forearm gets itchy.  But then again, it&#x27;s like that with many of the creams I use (they all claim to be non-hypoallergenic).  3 stars (it&#x27;s a market flooded with millions of kinds of moisturizers, I give it three because it is NOT unique.</li>
    <li> After trying Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer I broke out something fierce everywhere I used it, especially on my nose.  So I let my bottle sit for a couple of weeks, my skin cleared right up, and I tried again.  Same result: breakout central.  This is odd because I never have issues with other moisturizers, including those by Neutrogena. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s different about this particular formula (maybe the \\&quot;Helioplex\\&quot;?), but I won&#x27;t continue using it, nor would I recommend it based on my experience.</li>
    <li> this is the only face moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make my face break out and actually works. i got the \\&quot;mask of pregnancy\\&quot; dark spots on my face during my pregnancy that i&#x27;m still waiting for to go away completely. my dermatologist recommends sun block on my face any time i go out since sun makes the spot worse. i can definitely tell when i don&#x27;t use this daily moisturizer/sun block. i love it since it doesn&#x27;t make my face look oily, has a nice scent (with just a hint of sun block smell) and my makeup goes over it with no problem. :)</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me more than 14 years ago as the best skin protection available against UVA/UVB sun rays.  I live in Florida and use it daily.  I am not a sun worshiper but regardless of the weather, I wear my healthy defense daily moisturizer.  I also use Retin-A nightly so definitely need good protection from the sun&#x27;s affects. I have very, very few minor wrinkles and look 15 years younger than my age according to evryone who meets me.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As far as a sunscreen goes this works well, but its drawbacks are such that I will go back to my old sunscreen + moisturizer.    1)  It smells like sunscreen. I&#x27;m very pale and spend most of my summer smelling like sunscreen anyway but would prefer not to have my face always have that particular scent about it.    2) SHINY.  Unless you&#x27;re wearing with a light powder or matte makeup over it your face will shine, shine, shine.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup generally so this product was very unsatisfactory in this regard.</li>
    <li> I really like this product its light on my face and instantly does its job but after applying my face gets a little warm. Im not sure if that happens with anybody else but I think its the SPF. Other then that I LOVE IT haven&#x27;t tried it under makeup so we&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I didn&#x27;t faithfully use this product every day.  But I did use it in a variety of conditions -- hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to moisturize the skin without an oil residue -- and not just give your skin a shiny gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UV protection does appear to be genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A surprisingly small amount is necessary for each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that, since it remains in place for a long time, you need to be careful about rubbing it into your eyes.</li>
    <li> We all know how important sunscreen is, we hear about it in the news and from our doctors all the time.  Yet, why is it that most skin care products have only minimal SPF, if any at all.  Most body lotions contain no sunscreen at all and most facial products only have an SPF of between 15 and 25.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well finally, Neutrogena has developed a light weight sunscreen/moisturizer with an SPF of 50 that doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on my face or take a lot of vigorous rubbing.  It has a thin almost watery consistency that seems to soak into my skin on contact.  And unlike the sunscreen I use on my body, this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight dried out.</li>
    <li> I got this Neutrogena Healthy Defense Liquid Moisturizer Spf 50 With Helioplex as a birthday gift for a female friend of mine who is always complaining about her dry skin and fair complexion. She has told me in the past she likes Neutrogena products because they generally make a quality product at less than boutique prices. (I&#x27;m still wondering why she thought I would care about her moisturizing duties, but she&#x27;s a good friend so I listened.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer went on smoothly and dried fairly quickly. It took her a while to get used to the thin consistency of the liquid. She said she was used to using thinker, cream based moisturizers so she wasn&#x27;t initially convinced it was going to do anything for her. However, after a few weeks of use she told me she was quite pleased with the stuff. It provided a great sunscreen for her fair skin, and she said it was at least as effective as her creamy moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Says she&#x27;s is still using it and will probably buy some for herself soon. (Julie, the Ironman II blu-ray is due out in October, I believe...hint, hint)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the liquidey consistency of this product.  Not happy with it.  It is described as liquid, but I expected a more creamy consistency.  I will use it, but not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I never had any allergy problems with facial products, however this time it was different. After using the product for two days, I noticed little bumps - break outs everywhere on my face, it seemed as my face was swollen and red. I do not recommend this product unless you can get a sample and use it for 3 days, so you know if the same can happen to you. It is not a pretty sight to see your face like this!</li>
    <li> Large areas of tightly spaced itchy bumps where the sunscreen was applied along arms and across her chest. We treated with OTC Cortisone Cream. Two weeks later the bumps are healing, and some itching remains. Nasty!! Suggest you test a small area of skin before using.</li>
    <li> This is a very light fluid that moisturizes without clogging pores. Heavier types make my skin break out, especially when the air is humid. I find most Neutrogena products work very well for me.</li>
    <li> i love this formula to wear under my make up, feels like i am wearing nothing not like other sunscreens. love the package</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and like the consistency of the lotion.  I never have a sunburn when I wear this over my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> good profuct. competitive price than what u get in the stores. good for some one who needs a sunscreen. nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually not a fan of thin moisturizers, but this has worked well for me.  I went on vacation last week at the Grand Canyon and in Las Vegas, and this was the only sunscreen I used on my face.  I didn&#x27;t burn once!</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Healthy Defense Liquid SPF 50 is an excellent product that is especially good for your face in the hot and direct sun.  The product did not feel oily like others and the SPF 50 lasted for a very long time before feeling the need to reapply.  I definately recommend this product to anyone that will have their face exposued to the Sun for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> Break out city. I am no longer using chemical sunscreens. Here is a link to a physical sunscreen that will not break you out: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IRKGQNA?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00.</li>
    <li> My go-to daily moisture. LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> I did not find Healthy Defence to be any better or worse than most products of this type. It has a very liquid texture (those who love the &#x27;spa&#x27; luxury sense will not be likely to find this appealing - nor does it give one silky feel to the skin), and I did not notice its having any particular effect on my complexion.</li>
    <li> This liquid moisturizer is very light--make sure you shake it before you use it.  Also, its very liquidy--don&#x27;t squeeze the bottle--too much may come out.  This is great for every day use, but if you are going to be exercising or exerting yourself use another sunscreen.  I used this while playing tennis and it made my eyes sting.</li>
    <li> This product is discontinued. :( I hope Neutrogena either brings it back or produces a similar product.</li>
    <li> If you want a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t thick then this is the best I&#x27;ve experienced.  Not greasy, goes on easy.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this.  I&#x27;m a senior, so I&#x27;ve been using very rich moisturizers for some years now to nourish my aging skin.  This moisturizer is very different in consistency, it&#x27;s almost runny, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moist the way previous products have done.  I appreciate its protective qualities (which is why my doctor recommended it) but I&#x27;m having trouble getting used to the way it feels, and the way my skin feels after use.  I&#x27;m still undecided as to whether or not I&#x27;ll continue using it after this bottle is gone.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to sunscreen. I am very light skinned and sensitive so I wear sunscreen on a daily basis. I wear this over or under my lotion which also has sunscreen and have been very happy with it. It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make my skin a funny color.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and very pleased.</li>
    <li> It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.  The smell is a bit chemical smelling but that fades quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I&#x27;ve been using it on my face pretty much every day for a couple of years now.  Because it&#x27;s a liquid, this little bottle lasts a long time--when I think it&#x27;s about empty I just shake it upside down and end up getting another couple weeks&#x27; worth out of it.  When my face is really dry in the middle of winter, I do need to supplement with a heavier moisturizer, but for summer use it&#x27;s all I need, and it works great under makeup.  If my skin is irritated (windburn, or I&#x27;ve recently exfoliated), my face does sting a little right after it&#x27;s applied, but that goes away after about a minute.  I&#x27;ve never had any problems with breakouts while using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased Neutrogena Healthy Defense with helioplex at the store because I thought that Neutrogena was known for good products. Boy was I wrong. I have just returned from the hospital with severe chemical burns on my face. Swollen eyes, cheeks, inflamed peeling red angry skin, and aching around my eyes. The skin is damaged and will take weeks to recover. How is this possible to sell as healthy?</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months and am reordering it. Not greasy, great UV protections</li>
    <li> I did not like this moisturizer one bit.  I have dry skin and this moisturizer just could not hydrate my skin enough.  I will definitely stick with the more expensive brand moisturizers.  I will say though that I do love neutrogena&#x27;s facial cleanser and eye makeup remover...it&#x27;s a great brand, the moisturizer just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample bottle of this Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer because I have had good experience with Neutrogena&#x27;s other skin care products...especially their [[ASIN:B001E7688Q Neutrogena Healthy Skin Face Lotion, SPF 15, 2.5 Ounce (Pack of 2)]].&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just about finished it, and plan to buy another supply soon.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a higher SPF (50 vs 15) and does not contain alpha-hydroxy; I used it primarily on my nose area.&lt;br /&gt;It requires a good shaking...it has an agitator inside, like a spray paint can, for this purpose...not difficult at all to use and apply.&lt;br /&gt;The top twists off easily, and clicks/locks back into position when replaced.&lt;br /&gt;The tip of the container makes it easy to apply...either directly to the skin or indirectly by placing it on the finger tip first.&lt;br /&gt;The white creamy fluid applies easily and blends into the skin with minimal residue.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild and pleasant upon application, and is hardly noticeable minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;I had no negative skin reactions, and I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to folks that would like a basic protective moisturizer...you can depend on the Neutrogena brand.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  Very light and very effective.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t moisturize my dry skin very well.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I found it a number of years ago and use it every day.  It is gentle enough for my sensitive skin, yet has lots of SPF protection.  The fact that it&#x27;s liquid makes it ideal for use under make-up.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a white color like other SPF face creams do.  I&#x27;m a no-fuss, simplistic kind of gal so I like that this is both a moisturizer AND an SPF.  As a moisturizer, it&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture for my skin.  Not too oily and not too dry.  I am DEEPLY saddened and upset that Neutrogena has discontinued this product!  I tried their cream version of this and it didn&#x27;t rub in very well, left an oily coating and made my skin all blotchy-like and weird.  I looked older as a result.  It just wasn&#x27;t pretty.  I ask that Neutrogena PLEASE keep carrying this!  It is a much-needed product for under make-up!  I feel that, with a little bit of marketing, this product could sell SO much better than it has!  To me, it seemed like a hidden secret all of the years I was buying it.  In other words, it was this mysterious &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; package that sat alongside the usual creams.  Unless you were willing to try it out, it was difficult to understand how this product really works so well under make-up and what the perks were with a LIQUID formula.  Even when I went in search of it at my local Walgreens when it had been discontinued, I told the women at the counter that it worked VERY well under make-up and they were happy to hear this because they said many women come in and ask them all the time for something that works well under make-up and they haven&#x27;t always had good options for them.  So, like I said, if you get the word out and advertise a little more and explain what the benefits of having this liquid formula over a cream, I think you could sell a lot more of this product!  Because it works beautifully!  In the meantime, I guess it&#x27;s back to the drawing board for me.  Thankfully, I bought as much as I could on amazon here to give me some time to figure out what product to turn to next. :)</li>
    <li> I have ordered this a couple times. Very light. A watery lotion, not a greasy cream. Great for everyday and I layer it with more heavy duty moisturizer if I need something stronger. SPF is so important and this is a good way to keep your face protected.</li>
    <li> It is light and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy looking sheen on your face and appears to keep the rays off. Used to buy it at the drugstore but can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
    <li> I used to use Aveeno stuff exclusively and then switched to the cream form of this moisturizer.  I stumbled on this liquid form by accident and am totally a convert.  No more cream left in the bottom of the bottle, wasting my money.  It&#x27;s lightweight, absorbs quickly and well, lasts a good long while and has a great spf.  When nothing else was working to keep me from dry skin, this did.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. Full spectrum sun protection and a good moisturizer to boot. I would not go a day without using it.</li>
    <li> I like this product as a lotion and not a liquid.  And the scent was too much, gave it to my husband to use after shaving.</li>
    <li> So sad to see Neutrogena  has discontinued this product.  I purchased this at a discount store I believe (which led me to believe it was  being discontinued), and at first, I wasn&#x27;t too sure about the &#x27;liquid&#x27; formula.  However, after using it this summer and fall, I love it.  The liquidity actually makes application a breeze and allows for easier all-over application to your entire face, neck and lower neck (decolletage).  I have med-dry skin and still feel it provides moisture, even with what feels like a light coverage.  Nicest plus is, for 50 SPF, it isn&#x27;t heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave &#x27;sweat streaks&#x27; in neck wrinkles or folds. Another big plus for me is it just makes my skin feel good and somewhat softer.  I&#x27;m used to using heavy, lower SPF creams and they just don&#x27;t hold a match to this.    I also appreciate that you can shake the container and hear some sort of mixer balls inside which really mix up the solution well before you apply.    I ordered 5 bottles just to be sure I have a stock--hoping the expiration date won&#x27;t be a big issue.</li>
    <li> The lotion is good &amp; what I expected. But, the lotion will be out of date early next year!!  Not good; short life!!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday as a moisturizer and then put my make up over it! I have a different moisturizer for at night but it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF in it. I love how high the SPF is and how my skin feels after I put it on, so soft! I&#x27;m a redhead and my freckles are always looking to come out anytime I&#x27;m in the sun! Personally I&#x27;m not too much of a fan of them so this moisturizer is pretty nice because I use it as sunscreen as well! Plus my liquid foundation looks even better than before after I put this one! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I perspire...a LOT.  This is the only moisturizer I can use in the summer.  It doesn&#x27;t clog pores, it&#x27;s liquid and goes on easily.  Besides that&lt;br /&gt;it is a great sun screen.  Glad I found it on Amazon because getting it locally is difficult.</li>
    <li> This Neutrogena moisturizer is very lightweight and not greasy at all, which is great because I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts. This is the first moisturizer that dosen&#x27;t break me out. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> If you have flawless skin it might not be a problem but if you have a few wrinkles or creases this is embarrasing.  Put it on my neck and it left white lines for every crease. Not greasy but....I won&#x27;t buy it anymore.</li>
    <li> I think they changed the recipe on this.  Used it happily for 10 years but this bottle made my face itch like crazy.  Had to switch to a different brand of moisturizer.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A LIQUID MOISTURIZER WITH SPF 50.  GOES ON SMOOTH, GREAT PROTECTION.  HAD TROUBLE FINDING IT, BUT REALLY GLAD I DID.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT AND CERTAINLY BUY IT AGAIN MYSELF</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not the type of person to write very much about basic beauty products, but this moisturizer gets the job done. It has sunblock and moisturizing aspects in just one bottle - imagine that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for those people with very dry skin, I&#x27;m not sure if this item is the most cost-effective solution. I need to use a lot of it to prevent any dry skin from showing up in 10 minutes, and 1.4 ounces is not very much at all. I usually use a post-shave moisturizer first, so this Neutrogena product works for my sunblock needs, but it&#x27;s something to consider.</li>
    <li> This product is great and Amazon is the only place where we can find it.  Liquid moisturizer absorbs into your skin faster, therefore is more effective for up to 24 hours.</li>
    <li> I hope I&#x27;m getting great coverage, but it gives me too much shine in the summer. I see how it works in the winter months.</li>
    <li> Protects my skin but a bit pricy</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  Its pretty light but absorbs well.  The SPF 50 makes it an excellent choice if you live somewhere sunny like I do.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Could no longer get at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It is nothing like suntan lotion, it goes on really easy and smooth, it&#x27;s almost water like in substance.  It&#x27;s a great way to keep your face protected from the sun and feels really good by itself or under your makeup.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin and have never had any type of allergic reaction to face lotion or make up.  I noticed within one day of using this product that I developed a mild rash on one section of my face.  As I continued to use it for a few days, the rash spread across my whole face.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is the Helioplex in this lotion but I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> My mom was buying sunscreen from the dermatologist. However, theirs is quite expensive, so she asked me to find an alternative. This is so reasonable, is good protection, doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen, and has a great texture/feel. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the high SPF and because Neutrogena is usually good for any skin type.  By the 4th or 5th day I noticed a raised bumpy rash on my face. It didn&#x27;t really itch too much or look too bad, but I have a feeling it will be worse if I keep using it so its going in the trash.  I think it is minor hives.  I have never had a reaction like this to any face lotion or sun screen.</li>
