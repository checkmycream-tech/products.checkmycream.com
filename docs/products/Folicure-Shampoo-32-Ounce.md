      <li>It does not smell nice either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I liked it a lot and stuck with it.  </li>
      <li>so you can feel your scalp getting warm.  </li>

      <li>guess there are better hair products, but this one is cheap and does a good job for the price.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the only one using it at home, the ladies are also using the shampoo and conditioner and the results are great !!!</li>
      <li>I also really love the smell and have had women compliment me on it as well...</li>
      <li>Coconut oil shampoo by organix is much better</li>
      <li>I also bought  the conditioner (which surprisingly was very liquid, almost like clear water.....) and just in case I even bought the ampules.&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of days I started seen amazing results, and every day it keeps getting better and better.</li>
      <li>I have thin/fine hair which makes it break easily.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I&#x27;ve still got a full head of hair.  </li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t need all these different bottles in the shower! :&amp;#62;) Very happy</li>
      <li>Yes, more hair will fall out at first, but over time more hair will grow in than before.  </li>
      <li>Yes, more hair will fall out at first, but over time more hair will grow in than before.  </li>
      <li>I bought a huge 32 oz.</li>
      <li>This is great for deep cleansing the hair</li>
      <li>I feel happy using this product because I tried with many of other products</li>
      <li>About 2 months ago, I found about this great product when I was talking with my hair stylist and she highly recommended the whole line when I mentioned my concerns.  </li>
      <li>read a few good reviews, so I was hopeful for something more potent.</li>
      <li>I do know that my hair and head feel clean after I use this.  </li>
      <li>and I am certain I saw more hair fall out.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo isn&#x27;t special.</li>
      <li>have a full head of hair..</li>
      <li>Priced right</li>
      <li>because my hair is thin, i used to rely on a hairdryer to give it more volume, but honestly i dont need it anymnore!</li>
      <li>nice item i really like it for my hair especially for the price you cant beat it and with prime shipping!!!!!</li>
      <li>Very gentle for everyone to use</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has become my one and only shampoo, they have stopped selling it in the supermarket, but Amazon has it and in the huge size even better!&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended!</li>
      <li>I first bought Folicure in the mid-90s at a Pharmor in PA when that chain was still around.  </li>
      <li>I decided to get this product after watching a few good reviews on Youtube.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s genetics and that I take care of my health, but Folicure certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
      <li>folicure has made my hair feel so much fuller.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really do anything to fix the problem since I always thought there was no solution.</li>
      <li>My hair already feels soooo much healthier.</li>
      <li>This product stopped/decreased the falling very well</li>
      <li>Folicure really does help thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>I figured Folicure couldn&#x27;t hurt and was much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>:  If you&#x27;re losing your hair and treat your scalp gently thinking you&#x27;re doing it a favor... don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>It really</li>
      <li>and it really works.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and it leaves everything very manageable.  </li>
      <li>I found out about this product from my manager at work because i asked how she had grown her hair out so fast.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend to women of a certain age that are noticing too much hair in their brush.  </li>
      <li>It feels really clean, thicker, and overall healthier.</li>
      <li>ps...if you are trying to grow your hair out, or just get it into better health, i would recommend not coloring it for a while and using less heat</li>
      <li>I have been using the Folicure shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks now, and my hair is already in much better condition.</li>
      <li>I use just enough shampoo to get it to lather up lightly, spread it through my hair thoroughly and massage my scalp heavily to open up the pores and follicles.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from high end products, to natural homemade.</li>
      <li>my hair were very thin and so far I am happy with results and my hair get thicker.</li>
      <li>Remind your noggin that it&#x27;s alive!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why as it has a slightly chemical smell, but it&#x27;s pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Trough years I saw how my hair started going from thick and full of body, to thinner and eventually falling from certain spots.</li>
      <li>My hair is thin and fine naturally, and i had chopped it all off about a year ago.</li>
      <li>, it could have been other factors (like stress) but it was good enough that when I moved to another city and failed to find it on retail stores.</li>
      <li>but I would recommend frequent use as it appears to have sulphates which can severely dry out your hair.</li>

<li> Again, I could&#x27;ve gotten a bad batch</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have thinning hair, this is a great product to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for over thirty years. Enough said.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with oily hair and hair loss for at least the last 12 years. I&#x27;ve tried everything from high end products, to natural homemade. None of them have ever worked, all of them make me have to wash my hair again after a day of washing it. I found this shampoo in the supermarket and I decided to give it a try, without any hopes.&lt;br /&gt;Best decision I have ever made, this shampoo changed my life, yes it dries up the hair a lot and for thin hair like mine it makes it frizzy, but who cares, there are tons of products that help you with that and none to help for oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;It has become my one and only shampoo, they have stopped selling it in the supermarket, but Amazon has it and in the huge size even better!&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended! PLUS: Helped with my hair loss a lot!</li>
    <li> Folicure really does help thinning hair.  I&#x27;ve used it before but moved and couldn&#x27;t find it locally so am happy to have found it on line.  A couple cancer patients in the hospital where I work told me about it, so I bought some and used it and it really works.</li>
    <li> This is great for deep cleansing the hair but I would recommend frequent use as it appears to have sulphates which can severely dry out your hair.</li>
    <li> I luv this product my hair was shedding badly but since using this product my hair is barely shedding @ all my hair is also looking alot thicker I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This shampoo isn&#x27;t special. It&#x27;s basically goo in a bottle . Coconut oil shampoo by organix is much better</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Folicure Shampoo for many years and has found it to be a good shampoo with the ability to make his thinning hair look fuller, as it promises.</li>
    <li> This product doesnt work. I had been using head and shoulders and my hair loss had decreased. Once I started using this my hair started to fall out like crazy.</li>
    <li> I first bought Folicure in the mid-90s at a Pharmor in PA when that chain was still around.  I was scared of going bald and had paid an outrageous sum of money for some hair treatment that I don&#x27;t think did a blessed thing apart from get me to rub my head more.  I figured Folicure couldn&#x27;t hurt and was much cheaper.  I liked it a lot and stuck with it.  When Pharmor went out of business, I could never find it again and used that last bottle sparingly.  I looked for it for years, but only found it again in 2008 - I bought a huge 32 oz. bottle that I&#x27;m still working through 2 years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it keep your hair from falling out?  I can&#x27;t say for sure, but I&#x27;ve still got a full head of hair.  Maybe it&#x27;s genetics and that I take care of my health, but Folicure certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I do know that my hair and head feel clean after I use this.  It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and it leaves everything very manageable.  I also really love the smell and have had women compliment me on it as well... I&#x27;m not sure why as it has a slightly chemical smell, but it&#x27;s pleasant.  Use it for a couple of months and see if it helps at all.  It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than some of the alternatives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day - if I do, it tends to get even more oily.  I usually shampoo every other day, and definitely after going to the gym.  I use just enough shampoo to get it to lather up lightly, spread it through my hair thoroughly and massage my scalp heavily to open up the pores and follicles.  I usually condition, but try to get that only on the hair and not on my scalp.  I try to not use much product - conditioner alone usually lets me get away with that.  After 15 years, I still have all of my hair and I get compliments about my hair constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside:  If you&#x27;re losing your hair and treat your scalp gently thinking you&#x27;re doing it a favor... don&#x27;t.  Massage it and get the blood moving so you can feel your scalp getting warm.  Remind your noggin that it&#x27;s alive!  Yes, more hair will fall out at first, but over time more hair will grow in than before.  You&#x27;ll probably never stop all of your hair loss, but vigorously rubbing your scalp at least once a day will never hurt it.alive!

    <li> Tried Folicure instead of the Nioxin System 1 based on the rave reviews here on Amazon.  Maybe I got a bad batch of this product, but after a few weeks of use my hair became noticeably THINNER and I am certain I saw more hair fall out.  I switched back to using only Nioxin and after a month I feel my hair is thicker again and the hair fall-out is minimized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product works great for you, then good for you!  But it didn&#x27;t for me, so I would caution prospective purchasers.  Again, I could&#x27;ve gotten a bad batch but I&#x27;m not willing to try this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I would highly recommend to women of a certain age that are noticing too much hair in their brush.  The shampoo and conditioner are great.</li>
    <li> nice item i really like it for my hair especially for the price you cant beat it and with prime shipping!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo BC my hair dresser recommended for me BC my hair were very thin and so far I am happy with results and my hair get thicker.</li>
    <li> used this for years.  have a full head of hair.. good</li>
    <li> Trough years I saw how my hair started going from thick and full of body, to thinner and eventually falling from certain spots. I didn&#x27;t really do anything to fix the problem since I always thought there was no solution. About 2 months ago, I found about this great product when I was talking with my hair stylist and she highly recommended the whole line when I mentioned my concerns.  I bought the regular shampoo and dandruff shampoo (sometimes my scalp gets too dry from regular shampoos) I also bought  the conditioner (which surprisingly was very liquid, almost like clear water.....) and just in case I even bought the ampules.&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of days I started seen amazing results, and every day it keeps getting better and better. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;but I&#x27;m not the only one using it at home, the ladies are also using the shampoo and conditioner and the results are great !!! their hair looks shiny, healthier and thicker.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It really works!!&lt;br /&gt;I want to recomend it to everyone. I feel happy using this product because I tried with many of other products but they didn&#x27;t work. So I think this is the best.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year or so, I started using it because some hairs were falling off on a daily basis which got me worried. This product stopped/decreased the falling very well, it could have been other factors (like stress) but it was good enough that when I moved to another city and failed to find it on retail stores. I ordered it from amazon directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess there are better hair products, but this one is cheap and does a good job for the price.</li>
    <li> If you want to prevent hair loss, this is oneof the best option inthe market, it&#x27;s cheap and really helps</li>
    <li> Great shampoo thickener.  I am very happy with this purchase and recommend it if you have thinning hair.  Priced right and I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> awesome shampoo. Very gentle for everyone to use so you don&#x27;t need all these different bottles in the shower! :&amp;#62;) Very happy</li>
    <li> I have been using the Folicure shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks now, and my hair is already in much better condition. I found out about this product from my manager at work because i asked how she had grown her hair out so fast. My hair is thin and fine naturally, and i had chopped it all off about a year ago. From years of coloring, it just doesnt grow and i decided to try this product as one last attempt to grow my hair out. My hair already feels soooo much healthier. It feels really clean, thicker, and overall healthier. I cant wait to see what happens after using it for longer! ps...if you are trying to grow your hair out, or just get it into better health, i would recommend not coloring it for a while and using less heat products!this helps a ton! i let my hair dry naturally now, and if i am pinched for time, i will at least let it air dry 90%. because my hair is thin, i used to rely on a hairdryer to give it more volume, but honestly i dont need it anymnore! folicure has made my hair feel so much fuller. its really amazing. i read some reviews where there was hair loss, but i have not experienced that. if anything, ive had less hair loss because my hair isnt breaking and flying all over the place from blow drying. give it a try! good luck!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great.  Add thickness and in our results actually added hair growth to my husband head.  Great but too.</li>
    <li> I have thin/fine hair which makes it break easily. I decided to get this product after watching a few good reviews on Youtube. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for almost 2 years, and it did happen to my hair. Won&#x27;t re-purchase!</li>
    <li> Very mediocre shampoo that does nothing useful to prevent hair loss. It does not smell nice either.&lt;br /&gt;I read a few good reviews, so I was hopeful for something more potent.</li>
    <li> I keep seen hair on the shower :( also supose this help to thicker hair but not!!! This make your hair more thin, this just not good</li>
