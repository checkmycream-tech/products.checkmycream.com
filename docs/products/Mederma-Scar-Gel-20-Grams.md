### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I love it!!!</li>
      <li>Great price great product .i recommended to others , it itch a lil bet after I put the cream</li>
      <li>Mederma itself is a great product.  </li>
      <li>HAVE HEARD GREAT REVIEWS ABOUT IT</li>
      <li>It was a good price for the product.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s probably why it worked so good for me</li>
      <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t seen very many results from using this product on my scars.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It was recommended to me by my daughter, and I&#x27;m really glad she told me about it because I don&#x27;t know of anything else on the market that is as effective as this.</li>
      <li>I gave this product 5 stars because it is the most effective scar treatment.</li>
      <li>Works ok.</li>
      <li>and  Im sure it would work for scars on everywhere BUT the eyes.</li>
      <li>Maybe the cream would have been the better choice</li>
      <li>Maybe the cream would have been better than the gel?</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Changed my life I feel like no ones it looking at my scars their looking at me :)</li>
      <li>so don&#x27;t reply on this review :)</li>
      <li>It works great on old existing scars and it works even better on new scars; diminishing any marks more rapidly.</li>
      <li>so far its a good product</li>
      <li>The delivery was quick I was surprised and very satisfied, I wanted to try this cream</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and product undamaged.  </li>
      <li>I also haven&#x27;t used it since I first stopped!  </li>
      <li>Works great, on a new potential scar from a burn and a forming scar from 2 years ago!</li>
      <li>On top of that, it has helped with the fine lines around my eyes and the laugh-lines next to my mouth.  </li>
      <li>AND IT CERTAINLY DOES KEEP THE SKIN NICE AND SOFT AND MOIST</li>
      <li>the itching is definitely worth the results.</li>
      <li>It burned my eyelids and itched and defiantly not the right choice for the eyelids.</li>
      <li>and it was a very reasonable price to try for the first time.</li>
      <li>So that&#x27;s when I decided to order Mederma and at first I didn&#x27;t see and results</li>
      <li>But it does work well at reducing the appearance of scars, if you&#x27;re willing to stick with it.</li>
      <li>stuff does make my face a bit itchy deep in the skin, but it feels better than the steel door i took to the face and</li>
      <li>It certainly helps with scars.  </li>
      <li>The item only good for a few month, expired in 5/14 but did not stated on the description, I should have ask before hand, will know better next time when ordering</li>
      <li>I have a scar on my chest that I got from accidentally burning myself and of course I was very self conscious about it</li>
      <li>I read a lot of mixed reviews but figured it was worth a shot if it would even fade some of my scars on my face.  </li>
      <li>It takes a long time, particularly on a old scar, but it&#x27;s the first thing I&#x27;ve ever found that helped at all!  </li>
      <li>sure enough for some odd reason my scar was completely unnoticeable!</li>
      <li>i decided to give mederma a shot, especially considering its much cheaper on amazon, and i am AMAZED with the results.&lt;br /&gt;After just 2 weeks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it to just get the larger tube in my opinion, since you have to re-apply it several times a day.  </li>
      <li>, it IS helping slowly but surely.  </li>
      <li>Very light and tube is small enough to carry.</li>
      <li>but nothing really major</li>
      <li>but I kept using it 2-3 times a day and not long after I started to see some results</li>
      <li>I have a pretty noticeable scar on my face from a few months ago.</li>
      <li>But you have to use right away once the pimple dry a little.</li>

<li> Works well but over priced compared to my local stores and mine was due to expire within next 2 months.</li>

<li> My only complaint is that it expires in only a few months, not much shelf life left.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m down to two times as I have an active life.</li>
<li> Although I&#x27;ve been using this for like a little over 2 weeks, I have seen an improvement on my face due to acne scars.</li>
<li> Would recommend for small raised scars not large ones.</li>
<li> Wasted money.&lt;br</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t reduce but appeared to ease the pain and itching and also did slow down the growth.</li>
<li> and it was really hard to find tops that covered it.  </li>
<li> However, this tube is so small!  </li>
<li> About 2 months ago, I was involved in an incident that left me badly scarred across my legs and arms.  </li>
<li> This stuff is an expensive hoax.</li>
<li> fade anything and didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing to spend a lot on a product that didn&#x27;t work :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works well but over priced compared to my local stores and mine was due to expire within next 2 months. Not a fan of that!</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve been using this for like a little over 2 weeks, I have seen an improvement on my face due to acne scars.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and product undamaged.  My only complaint is that it expires in only a few months, not much shelf life left.  It was a good price for the product.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick I was surprised and very satisfied, I wanted to try this cream and it was a very reasonable price to try for the first time.</li>
    <li> The item only good for a few month, expired in 5/14 but did not stated on the description, I should have ask before hand, will know better next time when ordering</li>
    <li> This takes too long to see results. I&#x27;m going to try to get to the 8 weeks, but who can remember to use it 3-4 times a day. I&#x27;m down to two times as I have an active life.</li>
    <li> I like this topical med.  It certainly helps with scars.  It takes a long time, particularly on a old scar, but it&#x27;s the first thing I&#x27;ve ever found that helped at all!  It was recommended to me by my daughter, and I&#x27;m really glad she told me about it because I don&#x27;t know of anything else on the market that is as effective as this. As a matter of fact I don&#x27;t know of anything else that even claims to do this job.  Anyway....try it...you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> Works great, on a new potential scar from a burn and a forming scar from 2 years ago! Word Word</li>
    <li> I had a scar on my knee from having a wart removed. This product did nothing to flatten or fade it. And I thought it felt greasy. Maybe the cream would have been better than the gel? At any rate, it was not a winner for me.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I have scars on my face I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and I myself can see the results . Changed my life I feel like no ones it looking at my scars their looking at me :)</li>
    <li> I bought it to try it out ...I am giving it some time to work out...so far its a good product</li>
    <li> USING IT NOW ON TUMMY TUCK SCAR . . . HAVE HEARD GREAT REVIEWS ABOUT IT AND IT CERTAINLY DOES KEEP THE SKIN NICE AND SOFT AND MOIST WHICH IS CRITICAL TO PREVENT SCARING.</li>
    <li> This works well. I have keloids and did use it to allay the growth. Didn&#x27;t reduce but appeared to ease the pain and itching and also did slow down the growth. Eventually had it &#x27;cryoshaped&#x27;.  Would recommend for small raised scars not large ones.</li>
    <li> I have been using these to remove scars left by pimple and it works well! But you have to use right away once the pimple dry a little.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is the most effective scar treatment. It works great on old existing scars and it works even better on new scars; diminishing any marks more rapidly. My dermatologist was the one who recommended Mederma.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about buying this product since I&#x27;m African American, and scaring is usually darker and harder to get rid of, but this worked well. Within a week my scars started fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend this to African Americans who want to get rid of a scar !!</li>
    <li> Saw no difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Mederma itself is a great product.  About 2 months ago, I was involved in an incident that left me badly scarred across my legs and arms.  I&#x27;ve been using Mederma to reduce the appearance of the scars for about a month now and I have to admit, it IS helping slowly but surely.  However, this tube is so small!  It&#x27;s worth it to just get the larger tube in my opinion, since you have to re-apply it several times a day.  This tube ran out in about 3 days.</li>
    <li> I bought this to hide some of my scars I had for years. They are white not the pink fleshy type. I don&#x27;t think I have this enough time but I didn&#x27;t see any difference. I have eczema if that is why it&#x27;s taking so long. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so don&#x27;t reply on this review :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I read a lot of mixed reviews but figured it was worth a shot if it would even fade some of my scars on my face.  Well.. they started fading after a couple of days and then a couple weeks later are all but invisible.  On top of that, it has helped with the fine lines around my eyes and the laugh-lines next to my mouth.  Would I recommend this stuff?  I have already and will continue to do so.  I was so embarrassed about having acne scars on my face.  Now I don&#x27;t even have to wear cover-up. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> just started to use it seems to be working okay I need to give it time to work. time will tell</li>
    <li> Great price great product .i recommended to others , it itch a lil bet after I put the cream but it is working .</li>
    <li> This stuff is an expensive hoax. If you want to reduce a scar, just see a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty noticeable scar on my face from a few months ago. i decided to give mederma a shot, especially considering its much cheaper on amazon, and i am AMAZED with the results.&lt;br /&gt;After just 2 weeks the scar looks 50% as gnarly as it started out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does make my face a bit itchy deep in the skin, but it feels better than the steel door i took to the face and the itching is definitely worth the results.</li>
    <li> I had eye surgery and this was one of the products I could use.  It burned my eyelids and itched and defiantly not the right choice for the eyelids. Maybe the cream would have been the better choice and  Im sure it would work for scars on everywhere BUT the eyes. My experience was not good but that does not mean it wont work for you.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! I have a scar on my chest that I got from accidentally burning myself and of course I was very self conscious about it and it was really hard to find tops that covered it.  I practically had to wear turtle necks. So that&#x27;s when I decided to order Mederma and at first I didn&#x27;t see and results but I kept using it 2-3 times a day and not long after I started to see some results but nothing really major so I decided to stop using it for a couple days just to see what happened and sure enough for some odd reason my scar was completely unnoticeable! It&#x27;s now been a year since I started using it and my scar is practically invisible! I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I also haven&#x27;t used it since I first stopped!  But keep in mind that my scar was not deep at all what so ever and it also didn&#x27;t pop up either.  It was just always redish colored (which made it really obvious) so that&#x27;s probably why it worked so good for me and it might not for you but everyone also has different skin types so there&#x27;s no guarantee that will work for someone else.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet but I will continue to use. Very light and tube is small enough to carry.</li>
    <li> Works ok. Not what I was expecting for the price. It&#x27;s a big tube, that goes a long way, but the product itself sucked. And I followed the directions to a T.</li>
    <li> Wasted money.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t fade anything and didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing to spend a lot on a product that didn&#x27;t work :(</li>
    <li> Takes a bit of effort - 3 times a day for weeks. But it does work well at reducing the appearance of scars, if you&#x27;re willing to stick with it. Recommended to me by a cosmetic surgeon.</li>
    <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t seen very many results from using this product on my scars.</li>
