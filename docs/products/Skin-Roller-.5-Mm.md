      <li>This is great for aiding your creams and serums to penetrate the surface of your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy for you if it worked.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the numbing gel on it, I just put a good moisturizer on my face, and go for it.  </li>
      <li>I gave it two stars since maybe it&#x27;s still doing some good, but I&#x27;m going to stop using it if I can&#x27;t solve the acne problem.</li>
      <li>Loved the opprotunity to buy it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Good product, good results..</li>

      <li>, this is a welcome and important instrument in my ever increasing arsenal.</li>
      <li>It feels kind of like sand paper.</li>

      <li>It is very very important to santize before and after.</li>
      <li>Eat healthy.</li>
      <li>my purchase and glad</li>
      <li>In fact many people say it gets rid of acne.</li>
      <li>I think the results come mostly from the quality of the serum used after &amp;#34;rolling&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>My skin looks a lot better after I started using this roller.</li>
      <li>I can see that it is working.  :-)</li>

      <li>This will help any product absorb in the skin much better than using a product without it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had fillers and love them but can&#x27;t afford them all the time.</li>
      <li>Its also plumping up my face and the color looks better.</li>
      <li>I bought this to try dermal rolling :)</li>
      <li>Make sure everything is sterilized, however, including your face.</li>
      <li>I tend to work it mostly between the eyes, around the eyes, nasolabial folds, marionet lines, and forehead.</li>
      <li>and therefore I get the most out of them.  </li>
      <li>my skin has dramatically changed and smoothed out a bit more</li>
      <li>My skin def looks tighter and has better elasticity.</li>
      <li>In conjunction with aloe vera, vitamin C and A gel, this product helps the skins ability to absorb nutrient-rich suppliments for healthy skin.</li>
      <li>a great online photo tool is ipiccy dot com, - and in that under &#x27;effects&#x27; in the editing area are high def effects you can apply to your picture..</li>
      <li>Sterile work area, very clean hands and face&lt;</li>
      <li>I love it so much that I bought one for myself and after I saw the results I bought more to give as gifts to my loved ones.</li>
      <li>No thanks, I&#x27;ll just make do with what I&#x27;ve got, and count on good food, water and good creams.</li>
      <li>Rolling before a special event: DON&#x27;T DO IT, FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE.</li>
      <li>Hopefully the fine lines will start to disappear with continued use.  </li>
      <li>Item came as advertised and works fine.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for two weeks and have noticed clearer skin with some reduced fine lines.</li>
      <li>a picture of yourself BEFORE you start the process, in good light, with no makeup, taking note of how far you place the camera from your face and angle etc, and save the picture on your computer.</li>
      <li>I apply this device to the face only, concentrating on the crows-feet and forehead happy lines.</li>
      <li>No one has told me I look fantastic, but I think I can see improvement.</li>
      <li>Works well, easy to clean</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Very little investment for great results!!!</li>
      <li>More than it ever did between those hot flash moments.  </li>
      <li>but then again when i saw that this purchase was coming additionals i was excited.</li>
      <li>I still believe in these and the price is very right on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I just need to use it some more to give a real feedback.</li>
      <li>...that helps your products absorb more readily into your skin.</li>
      <li>It really does help my lotions go in better</li>
      <li>size is good for helping products penetrate (facial serums and hair regrowth products).</li>
      <li>My face stays red for a good 2 to 3 hours.</li>
      <li>Probably better to go to a pro if you don&#x27;t feel pain very well.</li>
      <li>:) I would recommend this for any one who wants to try dermal rolling.</li>
      <li>Great product I often order a new one to replace my old one.</li>
      <li>However, I thought of the application of the topicals as a kind of insurance against more breakouts, which was a higher risk for me because I do have some active acne, although I did try to avoid rolling right over them for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since you want to use a fresh one each time , best to buy several of one you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientists who have reported on derma rolling in general are very positive about the effects and compare it to fraxel laser.</li>
      <li>The directions of one roll in each direction up-down, side to side, diagonal right and diagonal left is a good way to start.</li>
      <li>I am an esthetician and love new products.</li>
      <li>So easy to use at home and much cheaper than I can by in Australia</li>
      <li>I have purchased and reviewed many of these here on Amazon, and have been using them nearly a year now.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
      <li>The only thing it is lacking is better instructions, and there are a lot of grammatical errors on the box which was kind of weird, otherwise its great.</li>
      <li>I want to get one a little larger for the neck area, this size seems perfect for the face but not the neck.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had significant acne for 7+ years since high school.</li>
      <li>I love this, I use it multiple times a week especially when I want my facial products to be more effective.  </li>
      <li>Roll in one direction at a time with quick straight motion and stop, lift roller, repeat.</li>
      <li>The delivery was super fast .</li>
      <li>Take this how you want, but understand that my hair grows very fast, over an inch a month.</li>
      <li>but I am pretty content on how they are starting to appear hopefully in another 4wks they will get better.</li>
      <li>watched Youtube to see exactly how this work.  </li>
      <li>I tracked my hot flashes against the hair loss.</li>
      <li>I do top to bottom, left to right,and both directions diagonally while holding skin taught.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The purpose of this roller is to roll your face prior to using any products to create little injuries or tunnels. The theory is that the tiny tunnels enhance the ability of the product to go deeper into the dermis. Plus, the body thinks it&#x27;s damaged so it rushes to create collagen to heal the injuries then WALLA your face is younger looking. I was SOLD on this product after watching dozens of You Tube videos on it, however, I was stupid enough to pay $200 for one from Rodan &amp; Fields MLM before seeing the videos. YES, it&#x27;s an awesome deal on Amazon. These have been used for a decades in Europe. When I read that Brad and Angelina do it, I thought gee they can afford anything so it must work. My problem is that I have not been religious about using it. I would definitely try it if I were you. Don&#x27;t go larger than the .5 needle on your face, however there is a 1.5 I also bought for my cellulite. I still believe in these and the price is very right on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Item came as advertised and works fine. I would have liked more instructions for us. Now, whether or not it works to improve skin? No one has told me I look fantastic, but I think I can see improvement.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and really thought it was way different. I wanted to get rid of some stretch marks and it hurt really bad .</li>
    <li> I am an esthetician and love new products. I&#x27;ve had fillers and love them but can&#x27;t afford them all the time. My nasolabial folds are very deep and I don&#x27;t like them. I put on a heavy duty peptide serum before I do the rolling. More directions would be nice but I figured out my own method. Pulling the skin taught where you want to roll helps. It does hurt but beauty is pain. I do it in the evening because my face is red after. I use it about twice a week. I am looking at buying a few more to give as gifts to my esthetician friends. I tend to work it mostly between the eyes, around the eyes, nasolabial folds, marionet lines, and forehead. I want to get one a little larger for the neck area, this size seems perfect for the face but not the neck.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try dermal rolling :)This size is very good it doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all. It comes supper sanitized and I have not had it lock up or anything :) I would recommend this for any one who wants to try dermal rolling. I don&#x27;t think it can do damage based off it size.</li>
    <li> Good product, good results..but, not real excited about the price!  This dermaroller should probably not be used beyong 3 months . .. that&#x27;s at using 2-3 times a week, then it needs to be replaced.  Using Vitamin C after treatment seemed to work the best for me.</li>
    <li> I got the roller (0.5mm) mainly to help with skin product absorption. But whenever I use it, I end up with clusters of pinhead sized pimples all over certain areas of my face 1-2 days later. I haven&#x27;t had significant acne for 7+ years since high school. So it&#x27;s absolutely caused by the roller.  This is so shocking to me because I see unanimously spectacular reviews of this product all over the internet. I&#x27;ve never seen a single review saying the roller causes acne. In fact many people say it gets rid of acne. So how could this just be happening to me??  Does anyone have a clue what I could be doing wrong? Please comment if you have any advice. I soak the roller in alcohol before use. and I&#x27;ve tried using clean&amp;clear bacteria-killing foaming soap before and after treatment... but I still get the acne. I gave it two stars since maybe it&#x27;s still doing some good, but I&#x27;m going to stop using it if I can&#x27;t solve the acne problem.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to clean</li>
    <li> Sometimes it is a little prickery for my face!</li>
    <li> It came without the case I was expecting. Havent gotten to use it yet. Have heard great things about it. Loved the opprotunity to buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This thing is nothing but a pain</li>
    <li> Great for the price! I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this after seeing all of the hype from a big skincare line. This is a fraction of the cost for the exact same product! I think the results come mostly from the quality of the serum used after &amp;#34;rolling&amp;#34;. Yes it hurts a bit but if you do it right it doesn&#x27;t take much time at all. Beware of youtube videos that show you to roll back and forth quickly. Roll in one direction at a time with quick straight motion and stop, lift roller, repeat. I do top to bottom, left to right,and both directions diagonally while holding skin taught. Find a video from a salon or spa, not a girl in her bathroom. After rolling I like to use those paper masks (My Beauty Diary makes great ones) w/hyauloric acid (sp?) The paper masks are very soothing and sit for 20-30 min so it helps w/the redness and soreness after using the roller. I&#x27;d recommend starting w/the .5 and working longer if you feel it is no longer penetrating. So far it&#x27;s been about a month of 2x a week use. My skin def looks tighter and has better elasticity. Hopefully the fine lines will start to disappear with continued use.  All in all I&#x27;m happy w/my purchase and glad I spent less than $200. After the masks and roller it was less than $40! Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> I bought the .5 for acne scarring and sagging on my face and neck. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much to be honest. But, family has noticed! I mean, these people see me every day and they have noticed! I have DEEP lines between my eyes and they have DRAMATICALLY reduced! I am so jazzed by this because they were really bad. I&#x27;d say they&#x27;ve gone from a 10 down to a 4 in noticeability in only a month. I also have cystic acne scarring...the divet type, not the ice pick type. They have definitely softened as well. I have not seen much reduction in the sagging skin on my neck, but I also have only done it twice on my neck because it HURTS! I also bought the 1.5 for cellulite but accidentally used it for stomach stretch marks. It left a terrible, itchy rash that lasted for days. My stretch marks bled and I didn&#x27;t even do it that hard. But, the sites that sell these things tell you to use the 0.5 on stretch marks, so that is probably why! I haven&#x27;t tried it since anywhere but my face. Its also plumping up my face and the color looks better. It does not feel good btw. I don&#x27;t want to say its as bad as a tattoo, but if you do it hard enough, it is a similair pain sensation. I did it to my husband&#x27;s arm and he jumped back cursing at me! lol I didn&#x27;t even dig it in. But, I guess we&#x27;ll do anything for beauty! I would recommend to anyone who is ok with a little pain.</li>
    <li> Love this item!!! Initially purchased it for my stretch marks after I gave birth in a matter of 4 wks my skin has dramatically changed and smoothed out a bit more I mean they aren&#x27;t completely gone but I don&#x27;t think they ever will be but I am pretty content on how they are starting to appear hopefully in another 4wks they will get better. The only thing is that it makes your skin itch after you use the roller but ive heard thats totally normal i use bio oil after i roll it over the areas i want. Very little investment for great results!!!</li>
    <li> This is a hard one to review.  The jury is still out as to whether or not it does anything besides inflict pain.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and use it on my scalp and facial skin, all for rejuvination purposes.  Even with only slight pressure it hurts, but I&#x27;ll keep using it, no pain no gain, right?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 55 and have been battling menopause for five years. my hair loss was on the top front to my crown. the rest is thick. I&#x27;ve tried rogaine for women and men, and spent just about a grand on all sorts of products. I even had my dermetologist cut a piece of my scalp and send it off for tests, but the result said nothing is wrong. nothing worked. I tracked my hot flashes against the hair loss. Periodically it would grow back when the hot flashes subsided but that had to be for 4 months at least.  Any woman knows you can&#x27;t predict those suckers.  Now... I did research and heard of this for the skin and others mentioned using it on your head. I did for 2 weeks every evening and my hair is growing back. More than it ever did between those hot flash moments.  Take this how you want, but understand that my hair grows very fast, over an inch a month. Tinting did not effect the new hair.  Using the roller doesn&#x27;t hurt, but my eyes water every time. I&#x27;ve stopped using 3% Minoxidil with the Azelaic acid daily, now only 2 X&#x27;s a week, to see what happens.  Minoxidil never produced anything on its own before.  my feeling is the roller did to my scalp just as it will do to your skin; force the collegen and cells to produce. My research said that if the area has been bald for a long time and didn&#x27;t have follicles you could see (they&#x27;d look like pores) it wouldn&#x27;t grow back.  I wouldn&#x27;t let that stop you from using it for hair loss. I had a couple small spots that were larger than the rest of my loss and they have filled in with hair.  I&#x27;ll never be without a roller and will replace this every 6 months. They are less expensive on the most popular auction site.</li>
    <li> I read about this product on line at anther site, and decided to try it. I have been happy with the affect. It takes a little practice to get use to the discomfort of \\&quot;rolling\\&quot; my face and neck. I am seeing improvement in skin tone and with old acne scars. I use the product every 2 to 3 days with skin care products. I would recommend to others who want to improve skin color and tone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with the intention of stimulating my skin and scalp. It leaves small red dots on the area and they hurt. If you have nice looking healthy skin avoid using this product, if a dermatologist prescribed it for you then go with the doctor&#x27;s advice.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really complain, because I paid less than what I&#x27;d pay if I bought a dozen useless items at the dollar general, which I have been known to do...but the quality of this particular roller isn&#x27;t too great. Skin rollers in general are a good investment, I think, and anybody reading this review can look to other reviews for others&#x27; experiences with them or for tips on how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Brand New Factory Sealed Microneedle 0.5 mm\\&quot; by \\&quot;The Body Back Company\\&quot; which I got from the seller \\&quot;leeleestore\\&quot; is very cheap, and not very high quality. (It&#x27;s not rocket science, here.) It works alright if you fiddle with it a little bit, but I got some pretty bad scratches the first time I used it because the construction of the roller is such that it sticks really easily and then drags across your skin, which scratched more easily than I expected. The next morning I had some angry looking red lines in a few places on my face, but I just slapped some skin oil on them and they were gone pretty quickly. To fix the issue, I had to pop the green part with the needles out a bit so that it would roll freely the next time I used it, and after that it was a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I&#x27;m going to go back on my word a bit and include some of my experience with the roller, just in case people buying it might have these specific questions in their heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Rolling over active acne: You&#x27;re taking a chance. If you&#x27;re willing to take that chance, do it once, gently, and see how your skin reacts. Make sure everything is sterilized, however, including your face. Rolling over active acne can spread the bacteria but it can also deliver medication to where it might be needed more. This brings me to my next point...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Rolling with retin-a cream/other harsh topicals: Rolling will make your skin more sensitive, and applying retin-a afterwards might sting or burn a little. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend applying retin-a before rolling. A different night, I also tried applying 10% benzoyl peroxide, and it definitely stung. However, I thought of the application of the topicals as a kind of insurance against more breakouts, which was a higher risk for me because I do have some active acne, although I did try to avoid rolling right over them for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Rolling before a special event: DON&#x27;T DO IT, FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE. Not that I have personal experience with this, but I&#x27;ve seen reviews where the lady is all, \\&quot;Omg, I rolled before my sister&#x27;s, like, wedding, and now like, my face is all red in the pics, so mad, one starrr.\\&quot; Your face will be red afterwards. It might be puffy. You might scratch yourself. Eventually, though, it will either go back to normal or look better than it did before. It might take hours, it might take days. Grown-asterisk women have no business performing skin experiments on themselves days before a special event and then getting mad because their skin is reacting to the process. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different; respect your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL/DR: be careful because this particular roller can and will scratch you if you don&#x27;t pay attention, but it&#x27;s still effective and mad cheap.</li>
    <li> This does open up the skin for products and peels. The results are coming slowly but are beginning to show. Not for those who ar sqeemish. It is very very important to santize before and after. I mist alcohol on the roller &amp; skin before and after using and then apply products. No little white heads or infections. Some could get carried away with this is they have a high pain threshold. Probably better to go to a pro if you don&#x27;t feel pain very well. The directions of one roll in each direction up-down, side to side, diagonal right and diagonal left is a good way to start. If you get a \\&quot;red rash\\&quot;, you overdid it.</li>
    <li> Product came as described I have used it for about two weeks and no results yet but I will give it another two and see what happens. The shipping was fast and the sell even sent a little gift. I am not impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for my face, I used it on my thighs. I saw some improvement on my thigh cellulite, but you have to use this thing quite a bit in order to see a tiny change.</li>
    <li> This is such an odd little product, but I actually have found that I like it!  It really does help my lotions go in better and therefore I get the most out of them.  I would highly recommend it!  But, be advised, just dont push so hard, you really dont need to.  It works well !!</li>
    <li> ...that helps your products absorb more readily into your skin. It takes a bit of practice (the first time I used it, I had little prick marks all over my face), but you get used to it, and it really does open your skin to whatever product you&#x27;re using. I always pour alcohol over the head after using, so it&#x27;s always clean when I use it the next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it once. I think I like it. I just need to use it some more to give a real feedback.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding??  This thing hurts when you roll it even lightly on your facial skin. Holy Cow, what we women are willing to put up with to look younger!  However, pain doesn&#x27;t interest me anymore, even in the interest of being &amp;#34;prettier or looking younger&amp;#34; for an additional 6  months or so. No thanks, I&#x27;ll just make do with what I&#x27;ve got, and count on good food, water and good creams. There&#x27;s no getting around aging, it&#x27;s going to happen no matter what.</li>
    <li> I received the roller today and used it on my clean dry skin, gently gliding it several directions over one area at a time while holding the skin almost taut. I applied only the pressure required to roll the device and made two passes in each direction. I then applied vitamin C /ferrulic acid solution(this is on Amazon) and my skin is glowing. If you look on Youtube there is a woman doing this so hard her skin bleeds, yechh!, there is no reason to risk infection. I am 59 years old and I have always taken very good care of my skin and even with all the good things I do, micro current, face exercises, retinols et al, this is a welcome and important instrument in my ever increasing arsenal.</li>
    <li> I love this, I use it multiple times a week especially when I want my facial products to be more effective.  So inexpensive and convenient to use. There is a little pain involved while using this, but the means justifies the end... which is more radiant and youthful looking skin!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that this really works.  I have used it on my face and arms.  I noticed that on my arms it did leave red prickle marks for several days.</li>
    <li> This microneedle therapy works. I&#x27;m a 40 year old guy and woke up discovering \\&quot;sleep-wrinkles\\&quot; that didn&#x27;t go away. So what the heck, I&#x27;m doing this for me and its not like I&#x27;ll be braging about this to anyone I know; I haven&#x27;t even told my wife. But sure enough, people are asking what&#x27;s different about my face. The differences are subtle so they can&#x27;t tell what it is. However, judging by the before and after pictures (4 weeks elapse time) I took of my face, the wrinkles appear to be shallower. Further, my complexion appears smoother too. I apply this device to the face only, concentrating on the crows-feet and forehead happy lines. I chose the 0.5mm. At the end of application you&#x27;ll be sensitive and look sun burned in the concentrated areas but, at least for me, the redness goes away after an hour. Sanitize the device well after each use. In conjunction with aloe vera, vitamin C and A gel, this product helps the skins ability to absorb nutrient-rich suppliments for healthy skin. Eat healthy. Use this before bed And sleep on your back. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I use my roller twice a month.  my skin improve. Also i bought one for my daughter. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This product works well, and is less painful than I expected. It feels kind of like sand paper. The only place it bothers me to use it is my neck. I may purchase some numbing gel for that area. I have been using it for two weeks and have noticed clearer skin with some reduced fine lines. Skin renews itself every 40 days, so I will make a new review at that time. I think it is worth a try for anyone who wants to maximize their facial care, and not get injectables too early.</li>
    <li> I used this around my edges and then massage the Dr. Miracle Temple and Nape on my scalp and this Has really helped the thinning edges 100%. This will help any product absorb in the skin much better than using a product without it. It took about 3 days to get use to the minor pain of the little needles, but I used it morning and night. I think if the needle was any longer you would probably need something to help with the pain. The size of these needles are perfect for face and the hairline of the scalp. I would definitely tell anyone to try it. This really helps with any beauty/hair growth routine.</li>
    <li> It does stings when you have it on your face.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think this is for home use. It can really make you bleed if you do it too hard or too deep.&lt;br /&gt;I got the .5 one......would not recommend longer than a .3...........&lt;br /&gt;But this is probably best done by an esthetician..</li>
    <li> I gave it a five rating because, I feel that it deserve it.  I don&#x27;t use the numbing gel on it, I just put a good moisturizer on my face, and go for it.  It does take a little getting used to, because, the little needles do stick you.  Nothing that I cannot handle.&lt;br /&gt;I watched Youtube to see exactly how this work.  My face turned red from the blood flow.  I&#x27;m black, about a carmel color.  The redness only lasted for a little while. This is what you want to happen, to get the blood flowing, this activate the cell&#x27;s.  I can see that it is working.  :-)</li>
    <li> I have purchased and reviewed many of these here on Amazon, and have been using them nearly a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This size is good for helping products penetrate (facial serums and hair regrowth products). You apply the product to clean skin then roll going in each direction several times (up and down, diagonally, horizontally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this on your entire face for overall rejuvenation using the same technique (also you tube has videos showing how to). This length of needle won&#x27;t hurt much (the smallest size sold is .25mm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this successfully you must follow these steps:&lt;br /&gt;-NEVER use on broken or ulcerated areas of skin&lt;br /&gt;-Cleanliness! Sterile work area, very clean hands and face&lt;br /&gt;-If you are re-using a roller make sure you have rinsed it in tepid (not hot) water after use then soaked the device in hydrogen peroxide or alcohol&lt;br /&gt;-Ideally use a fresh roller each time (very hard to remove the microscopic bits of skin tissue that will inevitably get lodged between needles, and you don&#x27;t want to reinsert that matter into the skin&lt;br /&gt;-apply a quality serum before rolling (preferably without parabens etc), spray with sterile water after roll and gently rub&lt;br /&gt;-Leave your skin alone for several hours aferward, no makeup or products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t overdo this - I have read about people rolling daily or weekly and as far as the research I have done (am a hobby makeup  artist and amateur aesthetician), for best results space rolls apart by at least a few weeks, unless you are just doing very very light roll for product penetration or along the hairline to help rogaine type products penetrate (it has helped with my hairline a lot doing this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers are all basically the same. I have used one that was more expensive with a higher grade type metal coating, but for me it worked less than the other stainless steel type. It&#x27;s the process of making tiny holes in the skin that is important not what metal makes the hole (together with sterility of course). Since you want to use a fresh one each time , best to buy several of one you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientists who have reported on derma rolling in general are very positive about the effects and compare it to fraxel laser. Just remember it takes TIME to see best results (you will see something soon, but months to really attain maximum results in plumping and scar/spot reduction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am pasting this advice below from my other derma roller and vit c-e ferulic reviews (the product I&#x27;ve used with my roller) because it helped a lot of people:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Take a picture of yourself BEFORE you start the process, in good light, with no makeup, taking note of how far you place the camera from your face and angle etc, and save the picture on your computer. Then wait at least 6 weeks (preferably two or three months), take another picture in the same light at the same distance, save to your computer then use the High Def effect in your photo software on your computer (or use the free one I mention below) and you will see with your own eyes the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the naked eye my skin did not look bad at all in my &#x27;before&#x27; picture - but with the filter I describe you will see what is going on with your skin - and then the follow up picture will show you the improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(picasa is no more but a great online photo tool is ipiccy dot com, - and in that under &#x27;effects&#x27; in the editing area are high def effects you can apply to your picture..you may be horrified when when you see your &#x27;before&#x27; picture if you have any sun damage - which most of us, especially Caucasians, have - it will bring out the sun damage and flaws in the extreme! They are flaws that are actually there, not creating them, and then emphasizing them! It will make you want to swear off the sun too. (I cross tested the accuracy of this effect in picking up skin damage by applying it to a four year old&#x27;s face - no damage!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took another picture after a month - there was a definite reduction in the apparent sun damage, applying the HD filter to the picture and comparing them side by side!\\&quot;n I took another picture after a month - there was a definite reduction in the apparent sun damage, applying the HD filter to the picture and comparing them side by side!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I highly recommend going to YouTube for use instructions, as this product did not come with any. The YouTube tutorials were informative and very helpful. I was apprehensive as to sterilizing the needles after each use, and nowhere on Amazon this information was provided. After the YouTube tutorials, I ordered another one for my scalp. I did use it already, and it left my skin very supple as if infused with plumping matter. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Great product I often order a new one to replace my old one. I use this 3x a month it&#x27;s been life changing for me and has definitely cleared my skin over time.</li>
    <li> Great product. So happy with it. So easy to use at home and much cheaper than I can by in Australia</li>
    <li> This is great for aiding your creams and serums to penetrate the surface of your skin. If your looking for scar or acne scar removal this is too short. The needles are not long enough to reach the dermis of the skin where collagen remodeling happens. I use a 1.0mm for that. I use this everyday in am and pm. In the am I wash face roll this over my face 4-5times per area with light pressure, not hard enough to make my skin pink. I put on Vit. C for antioxidant, skin serum/moisturizer then finish with a 30spf sunblock containing soy(evens skin tone and vit. C.</li>
    <li> This micro needle is pokey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it promotes college production, that&#x27;s pretty cool. I&#x27;ve got acne scars so I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with Bio-Oil on my face and it seems to be lightening up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roller does what it says it does, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5</li>
    <li> Tried this on a whim but did not realize it would hurt even without pressure. Don&#x27;t recommend using before leaving the house as it will leave your face red. Not sure if it really helps the skin absorb the serum I use but I&#x27;ll keep using it a couple days a week in the event it speeds the results.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to jump on the derma roller bandwagon at first because, quite frankly, the prospect of sticking a bunch of needles in my face on purpose was less than appealing.  After reading about it in depth, I decided to give it a shot.  I&#x27;ve had fraxel and other laser treatments and really, the concept isn&#x27;t all that different.&lt;br /&gt;The .5mm is ideal for use on the face.  I have only used it a few times but I do notice an overall tightening effect and some progress on some stubborn lines around my eyes. After the first time that I used it my face was quite puffy and a bit red for the next day, so if you want to try it you might want to be sure that you don&#x27;t have anywhere important to go the next day.  My skin was also very reactive to anti aging products for a couple of days after use. I take this as a good sign.  My skin behaved as if I had just had a mid level laser treatment (not as strong as a major fraxel blast but not as light as a spa laser treatment). The puffiness and reactive skin has diminished with use, but I would still suggest caution as it would be very possible to damage your skin by using aggressive skincare after the derma roller. Again, I see this as a good thing.  If  the derm roller didn&#x27;t do anything, there would be no side effects. It is definitely working.  Can&#x27;t wait to see long term results!</li>
    <li> I think it has helped smoothe out my skin. I don&#x27;t use it very often, maybe once every 2 months to allow my skin to recover.</li>
    <li> Caused break outs, so I Do not use it at all , I was surprised at the results, I expected better.</li>
    <li> nice.made well will but again..</li>
    <li> I gave this three stars because I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks. I began using it every other day and then down to once a week. I have to say it does hurt. Especially around the upper lip area. I think I&#x27;m going to have to buy a topical anesthetic because that&#x27;s the only way I will be able to keep at it to see results. After using the product, my face is beet red and hot. Oh, and I apply a layer of rose hip oil before rolling. My face stays red for a good 2 to 3 hours. I&#x27;m hoping to get smoother skin in a couple of months use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE****I Have thrown this roller in the garbage. The last time I used it it wasn&#x27;t rolling very smoothly so it scratched my face in a few places. I&#x27;m going to try a chemical peel next.</li>
    <li> i honestly wanted the roller alone but then again when i saw that this purchase was coming additionals i was excited. however, it was falsely advertised and did not come with the creams. good product, does what i ordered it for but ended up paying more because i wanted the creams! i was basically robbed! the seller should be ashamed</li>
    <li> I lIke the way the derma Roller works.I have used it in my face twice for scars ,can already start to tell a difference.I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this roller nightly for 3 months, and I saw no changes in my skin. I&#x27;m happy for you if it worked.</li>
    <li> I have really found this has made a difference in my skin especially for the price.  The only thing it is lacking is better instructions, and there are a lot of grammatical errors on the box which was kind of weird, otherwise its great.</li>
    <li> I love it so much that I bought one for myself and after I saw the results I bought more to give as gifts to my loved ones. My skin looks a lot better after I started using this roller. My skin is firmer, lines are gone. I am very happy. The delivery was super fast .</li>
    <li> Hurts more than i expected</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try micro-needling but was somewhat of a scaredy-cat.  After doing a ton of research on the internet, I finally decided to give it a try.  Guess what?  It&#x27;s not that bad :-)  Now, even though these needles are tiny, they did bring a tear to my eye the first time I tried it.  By the second time, I was a pro :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This size roller is perfect for a first-timer (kind of like training wheels), and there is alot of great info on the web (owndoc.com is a great place to start). So, if you are a little nervous, don&#x27;t worry - you can do this :-)</li>
