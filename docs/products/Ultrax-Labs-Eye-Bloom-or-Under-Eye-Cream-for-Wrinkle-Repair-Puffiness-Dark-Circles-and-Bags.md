<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Women in my family are prone to getting pretty noticeable dark circles and wrinkles around the eye early on in life, so when I started to notice the darkening, I knew I needed to try this product. It has worked wonders. I&#x27;ve been using it dedicatedly, and started noticing a difference within 2 weeks. My lines around my eyes look filled, and I look so rested and refreshed. The darkness has been reduced remarkably as well. Overall, this product is a win, and I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it before my lines and darkness got worse. I really recommend this product to women who have these hereditary issues like me.</li>
    <li> Finally those nasty dark circles are gone. Not only am I looking better, but I am feeling better as well. Thank you so much Ultrax Labs for coming through once again, you continue to amaze me</li>
    <li> this cream has really done wonders for the dark circles and lines that had begun to develop around my eyes. I&#x27;d highly recommend using it to anyone with these issues. It&#x27;s creamy, weightless and absorbs right into my skin.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dark circles under my eyes since my mid 20&#x27;s. I noticed results over the course of a few weeks. The dark circles are almost gone, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The product contains Nano Cell Cultures, which have been shown to be effective in rejuvenating the skin and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles also. This product is a gem, definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> For years I have tried to find a cream to  get rid of the dark circles under my eyes. With no resolve I resorted to cakey foundations and concealers.  Finally after trying some of Ultrax Labs hair products I discover the Eye bloom cream. It really works! As a result I&#x27;m not looking so tired and I am saving money by not having to by expensive makeup.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs keeps coming through for me. My momn ordered this for me and it has helped the bags under my eyes from long study and no sleep nights.  Really liking this cream.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really good. I rarely get any sleep due to being up all night because of pain. The bags under my eyes are horrible. By me being young, I had to do something about it. But, as am starting to use this, my eyes are beginning to look much better. My skin especially on my face is very sensitive but using this product is no problem for me. Everyone is different but so far I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months and let me tell you how amazing this product is. The circles under my eyes are completely gone. I feel and look so much better</li>
    <li> After just a week of using this eye cream, my dark rings are gone. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have had rings under my eyes for as long as I can remember...It has even softened the skin around my eyes, no more puffy eyes. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eye Bloom for months now and it really seems to be making a difference. No more dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> I am now in my late 40&#x27;s I noticed dark circles and wrinkles...,ugh. Used many other store  products but it always ended up in trash with no results than One of my friend suggested&lt;br /&gt;Ultrax Labs Eye Bloom Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a noticeable result around my eyes within a few days of using this product. I feel and look much younger:). It is not greasy like other products, and leaves my skin dewy around my eyes. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to look younger.</li>
    <li> The texture of the cream is real nice, if it feels too thick try to apply less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cream absorbs very well and it&#x27;s not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you might see a difference within the first 2 weeks it usually can take 4/5 weeks to notice the dark circles and wrinkles fading away.</li>
    <li> OMG! This product has absolutely surprised me. I have been using this product for only 2 weeks and saw amazing results. It not only got rid of the few wrinkles under my eye but also the bags from the lack of sleep. All i have to say is this is a phenomenal product and i definitely recommend it,.. A+++</li>
    <li> I have had eye bloom for several years, due to work shifts. I am in the middle 30&#x27;s and it didn&#x27;t look good. I started using this Ultrax Labs eye bloom cream for several months and I can tell you, looking at old pictures, that it&#x27;s working. My eye bloom has been reduced nearly a 50% and the rest remaining is lighter in color so it doesn&#x27;t look so aesthetic as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fully recommend this product. Give it some time and you will see the results!.</li>
    <li> Like the rest of the reviewers, I too have always had dark eye circles. I have been told they were due to genetics and allergies. Whatever they are from, they are horrible an embarrassing and as I get older I am beginning to get the ugly crow’s feet and laugh wrinkles. I have tried almost every “instant” or “magic” eye cream ranging from very cheap to the embarrassingly expensive ones and this is the only one that has done the trick! I love the texture and I love that I can now skip the under eye concealer portion of my morning makeup routine. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> This product is a gem and a half. Ultrax advertises results after 4 weeks - I saw noticeable differences after 2 weeks and unbelievable results by week 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is made of natural ingredients and carries a pleasant scent - no abrasive properties and no toxic smell. It feels fresh and energizing upon application - in a word, it feels healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who has struggled with dark circles will experience the results Ultrax Labs promises. Skin feels smoother (less puffy and more uniform), lines/wrinkles fade with continued use, and under-eye darkness reduces on the same quick timeline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give the Eye Bloom a try. I&#x27;ve used a number of Ultrax Labs products and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have tried 4 different products already and all of them are near $50 or more.I was challenged at first before purchasing this product but was starting to give up a little since I have tried other product with little to no effect.Out of all the products I use,this one goes in the skin FAST......I mean we are taking here in less then 3-5 minutes,whereas others take 15-20 minutes to fully be absorb.At the first week,the only slight thing I noticed was the dark circles reduce in over layer of skin as well as the very small wrinkle lines start to reduce,but after 4-5 weeks.Almost all of the dark spots and wrinkles are greatly gone........and I was soo amazed and proud of myself.It also seems to rejuvenate well which blends with my skin tone properly.Please use wisely and at your own discretion,as the bottle is only 30ml.I did mines by night BEFORE GOING INTO BED,because it is at room temperature where I am out so I feel it will have maximum effect on my skin,I just applied my amount,left the exact spot a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; more than needed and did not even THINK OF TOUCHING IT............I slept facing up,so I dont get the pillow dirty and next morning got up and went with my day.ALSO PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR FACE IS CLEAN BEFORE APPLYING SO THERE IS NOT GERMS AND THE LIKES THAT COULD INTERFERE WITH THE CREAM EFFECT.I am not going to say that you should sleep facing up,but if you cant or decide not too,try not to touch your face with any pillow or material so you dont take the cream of by accident.The bigger the wrinkle and spot are in the face,it takes longer to reduce,but it does reduce it in a good manner.I am gonna buy 2 more of these for a person that I know that needs it and its gonna be my gift to them.........</li>
    <li> I am not old enough for wrinkles, but because of a hectic job I don&#x27;t get enough sleep and therefore tend to have a lot of puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. This product has definitely helped a lot. I used to have to put a lot of concealer under my eyes to make the darkness go away, and now I am okay just using my regular foundation as this product has minimized the darkness under my eyes. It does take a few weeks to start working so be patient. I probably started noticing results in about 2 weeks of daily use. It works!</li>
    <li> Good eye cream. Works well but not sure why the price varies greatly.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows that the place that not only shows signs of aging first, but also influences the overall look of your face are your eyes.  As I approached a new decade, I started to notice fine lines under my eyes in addition to a slightly dull and puffy look when tired or stressed.  I&#x27;ve tried some temporary products and make-up, but all they did was mask the issue, not actively improve the skin in the area. I figured that as long as I wasn&#x27;t doing anything to nourish or repair the skin under my eyes, things were only going to get worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I noticed about this cream is that it didn&#x27;t have a heavy, greasy feel like a lot of creams, nor was it super slimy like some of the serums. I actually felt it penetrate my skin quickly and not just sit on top of it doing nothing, which is great news for someone with oily combination skin like myself where many cosmetic products can be fickle and produce unremarkable results. On top of that, I found that I didn&#x27;t need to use that much. I applied it at night and after a couple of weeks, it was like that whole area was 10 years younger. My eyes look a lot more alert in general even when I haven&#x27;t gotten all of my Zs. This company does make really good products and I&#x27;ve been pleased with my purchases. Ultrax does it again!</li>
    <li> OMG...this cream is amazing!! I absolutely hate dark circles around my eyes that I get from working nights and not being able to sleep so great in the daytime, and I have tried so many products to get rid of the circles! This cream works wonders!! I used for about a week and almost immediately saw results! I also had wrinks around my eyes that this has also smoothed out, it&#x27;s ridiculously crazy that it worked as well as it did. I would recommend this product if you have similar issues, it&#x27;s well worth the cost!</li>
    <li> This is a good under eye cream. It goes on thick and you have to rub it in well. Use it sparingly everyday to get results and you&#x27;ll start to see your dark circles start to fade. It actually heals your skin and gives it that youthful glow too.</li>
    <li> I am 33, sensitive skin, prone to breakouts. Not only did this product not irritate my skin, it as improved its overall texture and clarity. I am the youngest of the women in my circle of friends, but easily looked the oldest. Over the past few years I was developing deep wrinkles in my forehead, the dreaded &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my eyes, and fine lines around my eyes from squinting. I&#x27;ve never been very good about keeping up a skin care routine, and definitely never long enough to see results. The 3rd day of using this, I thought the deep wrinkles looked like they were relaxing, but I ignored it thinking it was probably just wishful thinking and didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up. Now, day 10, it is like looking at my face 10 years ago. The difference is undeniable. I regret not taking close up before and after photos. When I relax my face, there are no signs of wrinkles, only when I scrunch or squint do they reappear. My skin feels really soft, no greasy feel from the product. I know that everyone responds differently to products but I really hope that you get the same results I did. I stop and look when I pass a mirror (sounds vein, I know) but I have been hiding from the mirror for so long!</li>
    <li> If your looking for a solution to dark circles around your eyes, this product is a winner!!! Ever since using this product the dark pigaments around my eyes have disappeared. Within the first couple months I seen a change in how much they were lightening up. I still use this product and ever since have not stopped using it..</li>
    <li> The cream wotks perfectly fine. Ive had dark circles. I use the cream and they cleared right up</li>
    <li> Helps with dark circles, makes skin smother &amp; noticeably softer.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the best I have ever tried. It makes my skin soft, and has definitely improved the darkness under my eyes. No other eye cream has worked this well for me and I am so ecstatic that it really works! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s clear to see that Ultrax knows what they&#x27;re doing, so I thought I&#x27;d try to reduce the wrinkles I have under my eyes. They formed quick, and thanks to Ultrax Labs, they were quick to dissipate as well! After only a few weeks of steady application, my skin started to tighten and leave me with something much closer to the younger skin I used to have. It&#x27;s an easy application with a pleasant aroma - not overpowering, almost nonexistent when it is applied. There was initial dryness at areas of application, but these cleared up after only a few days!</li>
    <li> I work overnight. This product helps me with the dark circles under my eyes. My eyes look so much better.</li>
    <li> A few months ago a friend of mine was moving away and we took some selfies of us at dinner, we were laughing and having a good time, that is until I saw my picture. I couldn’t believe the lines around my eyes and the dark circles, I looked so much older than my age.  I’ve always been good about moisturizing my face but after looking at these pictures I decided to step it up a notch.  I did a search on eye creams and tried out a few but none of them really did much for the dark circles which were making me look so old and tired.  A friend of mine recommended Ultrax Labs Eye Bloom Cream, she swears by this product so I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve tried other products from Ultrax Labs and I&#x27;ve always been happy with the results. After about 3 weeks I started noticing the lines around my eyes lessening and there was a big improvement in my dark under eye circles.  I will continue to use this product, it’s well worth the price. I’ve tried other products that were almost double the price of this product and didn’t work as well.  I love this product, bring on the selfies !!</li>
    <li> I have been using Ultrax products for some time now and really love the results and quality. I was delighted to come upon a product that takes care of both of my issues fine lines and dark circles! Before I found this, it was either the wrinkles or the dark circles, so I’d go for the wrinkles and I use make up to cover my dark under eye circles. This product has cleared up my dark circles and I no longer need to make sure I’ve got some under eye cover up! Less makeup, less fine lines, and brighter looking face. I’ve always had dark circles and it is so nice to just look at my face make up free and see the even, smooth and clear quality rather than ok, but dark under eyes. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Tess</li>
    <li> I just turned 32, and I fell into a depression when I slowly started to notice the puffiness and wrinkles under my eyes, that I never have had to deal with before. When I was searching for a product to begin using, I wanted to put quality over anything else. I found Ultrax Labs Eye Bloom Cream, and I thought that I would give it a chance. I am so glad I did! I applied as directed every day, and within about two weeks I completely noticed a difference, and I feel lucky to now be able to look in the mirror and be happy again with what I see! I will continue to order this product regularly!</li>
    <li> I was searching around for the bets eye cream and came across this product.  It&#x27;s rated the #1 eye cream.  It moisturizes the skin and makes it really soft and you can notice a difference in a week.</li>
    <li> The area under my eyes have always been sensitive and prone to dark circles and heavy bags. I tried doing home remedies and they did help to a certain extent, but this product helped my dark circles and bags much more. Even after a few days I already noticed a noticeable difference. I would recommend this to anyone that easily gets bags and dark circles. It works really well.</li>
    <li> Using this product as directed have not seen any improvement with the dark circles under my eyes! Will keep trying for another&lt;br /&gt;week or so to see if any improvements</li>
    <li> Eye Bloom has worked well beyond my expectations! I&#x27;ve used other products in the past to try to relieve the bags under my eyes but with no luck whatsoever. Eye Bloom has made my dark circles diminish and I&#x27;ve noticed there&#x27;s no more puffiness either! Ultrax Labs has created another quality product and has given me high quality results! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> After doing some thorough research on the ingredients in this eye cream, I decided to try it. I am one of those kind of people that likes to read labels and do an investigation on each individual ingredient-to reap the full benefits. Interestingly, this eye cream has a nice list of multi-beneficial ingredients, which are known to be effective for more than just dark circles. In particular, it contains &#x27;Hyaluronic Acid&#x27; which I have recently discovered helps maintain a &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34; complexion. After applying this product to my entire face, I was completely satisfied with how soft it felt. It is not only good for dark circles, but it has also help smooth out my skin and give me more of a youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great! Definitely recommend you to try it and see for yourself how well it works.</li>
    <li> I really liked this eye cream. I have struggled with under eye circles/wrinkles since (I swear) I was 16! Applying it everyday, I have begun to notice the wrinkles becoming less obvious which makes me so much more confident in my looks.</li>
    <li> This product is a complete sham.  It has ingredients in it that I am allergic to.  I asked for an ingredient list so that in future I could avoid whatever is in it.  No response from a &amp;#34;user&amp;#34; or the maker.  Beware.  I presume the preponderance of positive reviews are fake.</li>
    <li> I have dark pigmentation around the eye area and people always assume that am tired or have not slept. I tried using lots of concealer but that has not helped much other than temporary hide the problem.  Ultrax Lab Eye Bloom has helped restore confidence in my eye area. I&#x27;ve been using Eye Bloom and can tell the difference it has made from using every day. The dark pigmentation has significantly approved and i no longer appear tired. I am very happy i gave Eye Bloom a try.</li>
    <li> One friend of mine, who has kidney problems, and was fighting dark circles all her life, once recommended this cream, after she saw how tired my eyes look.&lt;br /&gt;I buy it every december, which is very busy season for me, and I get no more than 4 hours of sleep every night. It&#x27;s one of the things that helps me to look fresh and good. I start the cycle in last week of November and use it till February, and my eyes look great during all the season. Before I started using Ultrax Labs Eye Bloom, my lack of sleep would show in black circles and wrinkles so bad, that after a while I couldn&#x27;t hide it under make up, no matter how I tried. I felt that I look 10 years older.&lt;br /&gt;This product is also very practical, you need to use a little bit at once, so cream will last for a long time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dark circles for the longest time. All I can say is I wish I had tried this product sooner. After less than a month of treatment my dark circles have all but dissipated and I now receive compliments about how healthy and well rested I look from my friends and family. I never realized how much older dark circles made me look, but now they are gone I would day I definitely look a good year or two younger. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been concerned about dark circles under my eyes most of my adult life. My mom has them. My sisters have them. We were all cursed with them. I&#x27;ve tried expensive beauty counter products (Dior, Estee Lauder, etc) and nothing helped. I just figured it was something I had to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, I decided to try Ultrax Labs under eye cream. I can&#x27;t believe how amazing this product is! Right away I noticed a difference. The dark circles under my eyes were slightly faded, which for me, was fantastic. I started using this product twice daily and the results are incredible. I no longer notice dark circles under my eyes and even my beginners crows feet have been eradicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this product and recommend it to anyone with stubborn dark circles or fine lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;ll never waste money on expensive designer products again!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first since I recently heard that dark circles are due to thin skin around the eyes and that creams and gels are just all hype. Eye Bloom Under Eye Cream for Dark Circles product actually worked in days in terms of relieving my circles a bit. I don&#x27;t have a specific problem with wrinkles so I cannot comment on how effective it is for wrinkles but for circles it works. The only thing I  would advise is to not miss days in between after using as the results come after continued use, not just using it and stopping. Price is very reasonable in relation to the results you get.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine was just sampling this cream that her friend had purchased but hadn&#x27;t recognized the results until I ask her did she get some sleep last night because she  had looked amazing compared to a week ago and now my spouse is using it.</li>
    <li> This cream was rated highly so I paid a high price for it.  I have been using it for almost a month and I have not seen any improvement in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> What I achieved after initial use: softer skin, lightening of dark circles and increased suppleness to the skin surrounding the eyes. I am just over 30 but am already noticing the skin underneath and around my eyes getting thinner (making dark circles more prominent) and my eyelids are often dry and puffy. Other products have been ineffective and either irritate my eyes with excess oil or strangely leave them feeling drier when the product promises to eliminate fine lines. Ultrax Labs Eye Bloom exceeded expectations. I could see a noticeable difference in the appearance and how the skin around my eyes felt after one day of use. It is a cream so a little goes a long way. Perfect for anti-aging or reversing unwanted changes to the under eye area.</li>
    <li> I have tried the ultra  labs eye bloom and it removed  the dark circles under my eyes. This cream really  works I saw the difference  right away. Only a small amount  is needed and you will see the difference  just try it .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve begin purchasing products to combat my dark circles.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 8 weeks as directed and have unfortunately seen no results.</li>
    <li> My mom have been complaining about her looks lately. So seeing that she is not young anymore, I decided I would buy her this product for her birthday. She has only been using it for two weeks and everyone is already seeing a huge difference. Her friends have been begging her to tell them her secret. I love my mom no matter how she looks but I have not seen her this happy in a long time. Who would of guessed that such a simple product, as this one, could make such a difference in someone&#x27;s life? I am so happy that I bought Ultrax for her. Seeing her face when she puts it on makes buying this product worth while.</li>
    <li> Has visibly made a huge difference in my eye appearance. Fine lines have been a problem for me for years. I have flushed so much money down the hole Ultrax Labs eye bloom has made my fine lines vanish and dark circles are completely gone. My husband says I have never looked more alive.</li>
    <li> If you ever had issues with dark circle under you eyes, this product is for you! I am at the age where those horrible dark circles were starting to form under my eyes and I wanted to do something about it. I did a lot of research and found that many people were talking about how great Ultrax Lab&#x27;s Eye Bloom Eye cream was. I purchased it and gave it a go. It was the best thing I ever did.  It looks like I lost years off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please make sure you stay on top of yourself and use the product for 4 weeks. To be honest, I saw results after only 3. It is like all of my ugly circles are gone. I would recommend this product to anyone. I am very happy with my purchase and I know you will be too.</li>
    <li> Finally a product that has gotten rid of the big dark circles around my eyes! I have tried many products that claim to work, but have never had this great of result in such a short time. Even my dark spots have lightened up. Eye Bloom offers a 100% guarantee.</li>
    <li> I used this product the day I received it at bedtime and the next day my eyes were swollen shut! I suppose I am allergic to this product.</li>
    <li> I got this product about 3 weeks ago and I have got to say that I am thoroughly impressed! The dark, dull color under my eyes has got a wonderful youthful look that I haven&#x27;t had in years. Wrinkles around my eyes are diminished as well. I give this product an A+. Thank you for a product that WORKS! :)</li>
    <li> I used this product every day for 2 months. I did not see any results.&lt;br /&gt;It did absolutely nothing to me on  very fine lines or dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I can only say that I liked the texture of this cream. It absorbed well;it is not greasy, but do not expect results .&lt;br /&gt;It is just another average cream. Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the way, I bought it because of the great reviews; I soon found out there are many fake reviews on Amazon and this product has fake reviews.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I posted my review I got bombarded with not helpful thumb down. As you can see, my review has now over 20 thumb downs. Did I make that many people upset with my review, OR this seller manipulates the review system by thumbing down negative reviews with fake accounts? I&#x27;ll  let you be the  judge.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer  noticed the same thing I did. Be aware of scams.</li>
    <li> I have had very dark circles and puffiness under my eyes for the last few years. Much of it is due to stress and poor sleep. However, this product has made a noticeable difference in about 3 weeks time! The puffiness is gone, and the dark circles are nearly gone. And, I should say I am not sleeping much better so I attribute this to the product. Worth the price, in my opinion. Sometimes the more costly &#x27;cosmeceuticals&#x27; really are worth it!</li>
    <li> This product is incredible.  After just a few days, I see a difference.  My skin is more supple and the bags under my eyes ae less noticeable.  They aren&#x27;t as puffy and dark.  I just look younger.  Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Very rich and creamy. Saw results in the first week of use. Overall brightness around eye area and fine lines are diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an expensive eye cream but it last a long time. We all want ours money worth, if your looking for an eye cream with results. This is the one.</li>
    <li> I got this eye cream a few weeks ago and it really does get rid of my puffiness and dark circles…almost instantly!  I don&#x27;t have terrible wrinkles, so it&#x27;s hard to say from my experience if it reduces them but I do have fine lines.  My boyfriend even noticed and complimented me saying that my face just looks brighter and more awake!  This jar will last me a while, even using it twice a day, but I will definitely be purchasing more when I start to run low so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> being a parent of  of 3 I often find my self not sleeping at night and waking up with dark circles I have really found this cream to help almost instantly I saw a difference in my skin under my eyes honestly I don&#x27;t know what I would have done if I didn&#x27;t find this  its top notch eye cream</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and has worked great for me, helping to lessen my face wrinkles and even lightened the dark circles under my eyes. It&#x27;s very easy to use and I saw results within only a few weeks! This is one of the only products that has worked for me and caused no annoying irritation or effects. The price can&#x27;t be beat here on amazon and it&#x27;s quality is impressive. I would definitely recommend it and plan on buying it again in the future. Shipping was fast and overall great value for the price...definite buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams and treatments before to get rid of the puffiness under my eyes that I&#x27;ve had for years. My mother recommended this cream and I&#x27;m delighted with the results. Looking in the mirror is loke looking at someone else! For the first time I can remember I look awake and healthy! I cannot recommend this eye cream enough, It&#x27;s not like the others, I have seen a real difference. Thanks you!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month and let me tell you this product works. The circles under my eyes are completely gone. I feel and look so much better. Thanks ultra labs</li>
    <li> Eye Bloom is a must. I have had dark circles under my eyes and for as long as I can remember and with age I started to notice wrinkles too. Eye Bloom has really made a difference. My dark circles and wrinkles are much less noticeable and my skin looks refreshed and feels softer and smoother. I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> So I have tried every cream on the market to get rid of my dark under eye circles and finally I have found a product that actually works! I have been using the ultrax labs eye bloom eye cream for a few short weeks now and my under eye circles are completely gone. My skin is so soft underneath my eyes because of this cream and I am so impressed with the difference. Instead of looking tired all day I look awake and refreshed and my confidence has been repaired! I am so happy with this eye cream, if you struggle with dark circles or wrinkles under the eye area I highly recommend it! I will be purchasing this again!!</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product, I was so surprised with the gentle ingredients used perfect for daily use. I have sensitive skin so I was worried about breakouts and acne, so I was happy I did not have any of those problems. The actual product itself works well and I saw a decrease in dark circles and bags under my eye. I could feel and see the difference within a week, and after a month of daily use, I have no more bags. I can go without makeup and feel confident about my looks. It&#x27;s such a small thing being about to go makeup free but this product has allowed me to do that whenever I choose to.</li>
    <li> This stuff was a great eye cream. I received a small sample with a different order. Now I&#x27;m waiting to order the full size!&lt;br /&gt;This is not too greasy, enough grip to put make-up over. I may be young but, I&#x27;m absolutely sick of the circles under my eyes and this does the trick. Saw a difference in just a couple of uses. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am over 40, and a busy mother of three young boys.  My days are long and I never seem to get enough sleep.  So often people would tell me that I looked tired or run down because of the dark circles and under eye puffiness.  I have tried other Ultrax Lab products and have been very happy with them, so I decided to take a chance on this product.  I am so glad that I did.  The cream itself is rich and thick and absorbs easily.  In a few days I noticed a reduction in the puffiness and dark circles.  My crows feet were also smoother and less noticeable.  My eyes looked brighter and I appear more rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is really gentle to the delicate under eye area.  A little goes a long way.  Makeup glides over the product without looking caked or clumpy. This cream worked so much better than other high end cosmetic brands I have used in the past.  Really a great find.</li>
    <li> i have been use this product for almost month and i did not notice big difference on the dark circle. it  dosnt worth the money</li>
    <li> I have always struggled with dark circles under my eyes, and now that I am in my mid 30s I am beginning to see more fine lines around the corners of my eyes. I have tried many products over the years, and while many were great, they never really made much of a difference with my dark circles--until I tried Eye Bloom! Within the first week I saw a noticeable difference, and within three weeks my circles were gone and my fine lines have been erased! I&#x27;m so impressed that I can&#x27;t wait to try more products form Ultrax Labs.</li>
    <li> After struggling with under eye circles for many years, I have went through many creams and serums looking for something that would help out. While the ultrax cream is not a miracle, it did substantially diminish the dark circle under my eyes with a week or two after starting use so I give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t take care of the dark circles or wrinkles under my eye ( im pretty young- 26 years old) and thought paying this much for an eye cream would be beneficial and hopefully work- it didnt. It serves as a moisturizer for under my eyes that I could buy for 10 dollars with another product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dark under eyes circles for many years now and tried countless products to get rid of them but never found one til now! I use it every night before going to bed and it&#x27;s very effective! Recommend it to anyone having trouble looking for a good product and it&#x27;s not as pricey as other creams! Love it :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely loving this eye cream!  I already see results and I have only been using it for less than 4 weeks. I look rested and much younger!  I knew it was working when I started getting lots of compliments and comments from friends, family members, and co-workers.  I have tried numerous other products and did not feel like there was any noticeable difference even after constant use.  Great Product!  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many eye creams. I&#x27;ve had this for 2 days - a mere 2 days - and see improvements in fine lines. Wow. I&#x27;m turning 50 (gasp) this year and have developed fine lines under my eyes. No crows feet so I can&#x27;t comment on how the cream works on those but for fine lines/crepe-like skin this is great. As I said, I wish I had found this years ago - before I wasted hundreds, possibly thousands of dollars on lesser products that don&#x27;t deliver.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from Dark circles due to fatigue and lack of sleep and really this eye cream does the trick!!&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other products it really does what it is supposed to and these days it&#x27;s rare.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply penetrate immediately and get my beautiful brown eyes their sparkle back :-)</li>
    <li> This cream is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;m so glad I came across this product, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is such a nice solution to what has been a problem for me on a number of occasions.  I have late nights at work which over the years have affected my look especially for morning meetings and presentations.  This has alleviated a lot of those visual circles under the eye and the wear and tear of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It brings more confidence and also makes me look younger and more vibrant as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to lose here, only gain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been working some all nighters, so started getting puffy eye looks. This stuff really helped, I started applying it and within a few days saw a very noticeable difference. The &amp;#34;exhausted/haggard&amp;#34; look I started getting noticeable faded away, thank God. Who wants to look like a haggard cartoon character? The darkness under my eyes is much less noticeable and the way it effects the skin reminds me of lotion on dry hands. Really nice, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I have tried.  It has really helped rid the dark circles under my eyes and has given my face a more refreshing look.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to easily get rid of dark circles.</li>
    <li> This cream really works and I saw a difference right away. I had severe dark circles under my eyes due to lifelong insomnia but Eye Bloom has made a big difference. You only need a tiny bit to have Eye Bloom do the job. I highly reccommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic of most anti-aging products but I must admit, this product is amazing. Almost immediately my skin felt softer and smoother.  The fine lines and wrinkles were visibly reduced. It hydrated my face without being greasy. It left my skin feeling absolutely wonderful. This product makes me feel like I have an instant face lift at the tip of my fingertips. My beautiful eyes are beautiful again.</li>
    <li> This right here will eliminate any dark eye circle and bring 15 years back to your youth.</li>
    <li> Have used this for several months now, and I must say that it works! I saw results under 4 weeks, especially with the bags and skin discoloration. This, I&#x27;d consider a big step up from other products I&#x27;ve used like Loreal and Nuetragena. I apply once in the morning and again before bed, plus the cream feel seems to instantly take affect. My sister asked what I&#x27;d been using, now she&#x27;s also a regular user! Now, I&#x27;m in my early 30s, but looking and feeling as though I&#x27;m back to those early 20s. The ingredients are not harsh and I experienced no side effects as with others. Try this one, I know that all products have different effects on different people, but this does work for me and might for you!</li>
    <li> I never thought I needed to use wrinkle cream until my sister came home from college and pointed out the dark circles under my eyes. It really hurt, because I instantly felt ten years older that I really am. Now that she pointed it out, I notice my dark circles every day when I look in the mirror in the mornings. My mom recommended I purchase Ultrax Labs Eye Bloom Under Eye Cream and I can already see a difference. This is my first experience with any type of eye cream, and I am very happy with the purchase. I will continue using this product a will recommend it to anyone who is experiencing dark circles under their eyes.</li>
    <li> I would never have believed the difference this cream would make without trying it myself, I am generally very skeptical of products like this but I was coerced into buying it by my partner. I have had the dark circles under my eyes for years, mostly due to my poor sleeping habits and I was perfectly resigned to them staying that way. However! This product does exactly what it says! I look younger and healthier after only afew days of using it. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it continues. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a great product my eyes have never looked so young , radiant and refreshed. I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I tried this after not getting enough sleep and what seemed to be growing circles under my eyes. It was a cool, refreshing cream that blended in to my skin smoothly and left it feeling nourished. After two weeks, I am definitely noticing an improvement with the circles under my eyes becoming increasingly lessening. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and will continue to use it when I may find that my eyes are in need of touching up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what Nano Cultures are, but they sure do work hard!!!  Sometimes late nights, bad food choices, and long hours make my eyes look tired causing puffy, dark circles and crows feet. Eye Bloom feels good going on. It is relaxing and makes you feel better about yourself almost immediately. This product works well and clearly reduces those little crinkles in just a few days. It relieves puffiness right away.  Most amazingly, it almost magically transforms dark, under eye circles to a brighter, healthier look. I have already recommended this to friends who have struggled with dark circles for years.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this product. I plan to use this product faithfully to keep hard work and age at bay.</li>
    <li> Love how this product really covers my dark circles. I have had dark circles for as long as I can remember and not even makeup would do the trick for me. So Decided to give this product a try and boy was I amazed at how great it made my eyes look!!!! it made them come alive and look even more sexier when I wear my makeup. I love that the dark circles are gone and I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon anymore!!! this product is amazing!!! it feels great on my skin, it is very affordable and it gives great results. I would gladly recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> For something so easy to use, I&#x27;m very impressed. The bags under my eyes are slowly starting to go away. Over the past few weeks there has been a very noticeable improvement in the appearance of my dark circles. They&#x27;re fading and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be gone within a couple of more weeks. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to get rid of their dark circles or bags under their eyes!</li>
    <li> Dark circles were always my enemy but using Eye Bloom has changed that. I absolutely love this product. Its creamy and smells great plus no more dark circles. I have been using it for a few days now and the results were amazing. I have even noticed my wrinkles slowly fading away. Customer for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a in-home caregiver which means I&#x27;m up and down basically all night.  I never get a straight 8 hours of sleep.  One day I looked in the mirror and almost didn&#x27;t recognize myself!  I&#x27;ve never had circles until this stage of my life and it&#x27;s upsetting!  I&#x27;ve had good luck with Ultrax Labs products, so I decided to give it try and so far I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  The cream is nice and light and goes on smoothly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny, greasy film around your eyes like some eye creams.  My eyes look less puffy and those circles aren&#x27;t as dark.  I&#x27;m really pleased.  This product might be slightly expensive, but I&#x27;ve spent even more on other eye creams and they didn&#x27;t even work.  This jar will last you a long time because you don&#x27;t even need that much anyway, so it&#x27;s worth the price!  My mom even started using it! She&#x27;s the reason why I have dark circles so I told her the next jar is on her!  Good formula.  My signature cream!</li>
    <li> I have noticed a huge difference in my appearance using Ultrax Labs Eye Bloom Cream.  I had pretty dark circles underneath my eyes due to poor sleeping habits, age and genetics.  I purchased the Eye Bloom three weeks ago and apply it twice a day and I am amazed at how well it works!!  It goes on very smooth and is nice and creamy, it does not tug on the delicate eye area and leaves the skin smooth for makeup application.  It not only makes my face look younger and refreshed but it is also helping to smooth out the fine lines around my eyes ( crows feet).  The eye cream is such a wonderful product and I started seeing a difference in the first two weeks of regular applications.  Once my sister noticed how well it works on my dark circles under the eye, she purchased some for herself too! I highly recommend this product!  A little goes a long way so it is well worth the money.  This is my new &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34; product for under eye circles and fine lines.  I will definitely be purchasing more and am very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> This product helps to reduce wrinkles and dark spots just as described! It takes a few days to see improvements, but this product is amazing! From one beauty freak to another, try it!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is really good, I have been using it for a couple of months and I am addicted. I love the feeling of putting it on, it feels really soft and soothing. It has faded my circles so much that I don&#x27;t have to load on the concealer anymore! Plus my wrinkles and morning puffiness are way better!</li>
    <li> I have been a lifelong dark under eye girl. I also have tried so many creams gels you name it to rid or dimenish my circles. I was told that my diet all the way to heredity caused the dark no sleep look. Now I am writing this review to share my long journey has stopped. Within days of applying the Ultrax Eye bloom under eye cream to be utterly and happily suprised that IT WORKS. I noticed and so did family. This is a miracle.</li>
    <li> nce I started using this cream I noticed that the dark circles I get under my eyes disappeared. My Crows feet are less noticeable and I have generally softer skin near my eyes! My skin also glows and it definitely looks younger and feels firmer. I am so satisfied with this product and will continue to use it. You get a lot of it and it&#x27;s a good price. It&#x27;s easy to use and apply!</li>
    <li> Dark Circles can really make you feel self conscious. I am so glad I finally found something that makes me look lively and well rested.</li>
    <li> Ibought this product for my mom for her birthday. she had used a lot of products over the years, some worked and some didn&#x27;t much of a difference . But Eye Bloom is a Different Story!!!!. Within the first  two week she saw a noticeable difference, and within a month  her circles were gone and the fines lines were noticeablly reduced</li>
    <li> If you’re looking for a great product to reduce under eye appearance, then you won’t be disappointed by Ultraz EyeBloom Under Eye Cream. It&#x27;s only been a few days and I love the cream. It&#x27;s super soft and once it’s absorbed, there is a new glow as skin feels and looks fresher. Age spots, puffiness, or dark circles can be eliminated by the anti-aging and anti-oxidant ingredients which is why I immediately bought this product. It’s hard to nourish our skin with our busy schedules, but this product is convenient to use and is able to purify and nourish all at once. I give this product an A+ since it definitely helps rejuvenate the skin quickly!</li>
    <li> dark circles are gone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this for a month so far and I have seen a considerable improvement in my skin, the dark circles that were ALWAYS under my eyes whether I was tired or not are now gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love this stuff, wish I could buy it in a 55 gallon drum sized container!</li>
    <li> I am an ER doctor that works a crazy schedule...I have had gray bags under my eyes that have been getting progressively worse.  I have been using this for a month now and the skin under my eyes has become less puffy and dark.  This product is worth the money.</li>
    <li> i love how it looks it covers up all day!, at first when you put it on it may be thick but it like melts down and become creamy and soft, it may crease when u first put it on i just spread it again a lil and it stops creasing i think that is just cause it needs to dry a little but its nothing no harm i love it, it covers my dark circles and honestly i feel beautiful cause im young and have dark eye circles n this covers it all day, i recommend it and it came like a week and a half before it said it would come so that is great too.</li>
    <li> GREAT AND EFFECTIVE! LOVES IT!</li>
    <li> It really worked on the dark circles under my eyes.  I have very few wrinkles around my eyes. I will have to wait and see if it works on my wrinkles as well.</li>
    <li> I was always dealing with dark circles under my eyes that I inherited from my mother. It wasn&#x27;t until I was recommended this product that I was able to get rid of them. I definitely pass along that recommendation to anyone who has had similar problems.</li>
    <li> This is a MUST HAVE! Im amazed that only after a month of use I can see a difference. It keeps my skin fresh, hydrated and supple - but not damp and greasy, it feels very light and absorbs quickly. I can even apply my eye makeup over it in the morning without it smudging. Also not irritating to eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do acknowledge its moderate cost, I found it to be worth the money.  I have told all the ladies I work with to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Ultrax Labs Eye Bloom Eye Cream is the perfect product for dark circles and wrinkles. Within a few weeks the dark circles and wrinkles are reduced in appearance. The cream also helps with age spots and moisturizes and softens skin. To use, clean your skin, apply a small amount on the problem areas, and massage until the cream is absorbed.</li>
    <li> Does not say &amp;#34;for dark circles&amp;#34; - did nothing at all! They should be ashamed selling it at this price. My suggest: Do not wast your money, you can rub anything else instead and it&#x27;ll be just as good!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream was discontinued a few years ago, much to my chagrin. I’ve been trying to find a good replacement ever since but haven’t found anything that I like as much as that one. Eye Bloom is the first cream I’m found that comes close though! It really reduces the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. I feel like my eyes look younger and more “refreshed”, which I love, and the cream feels good too. I’m glad I found it!!!</li>
    <li> Who would have thought that applying just a touch of this would make such a difference? Try it once and see the difference. When your eyes don&#x27;t look tired even your smile looks brighter!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
    <li> This cream really works wonders. I noticed an improvement right away. It&#x27;s not heavy on the skin either. It&#x27;s light and smooth on the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My dark circles have noticeably been reduced. I also noticed that it has reduced the fine lines around my eyes and my eyes aren&#x27;t as puffy, making me look younger. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to reduce dark circles and get rid of their puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen any results yet and I have couple weeks using it, may take  longer due is not a surgical process but so far feels good hypoallergic etc</li>
    <li> I was noticing my under eyes were getting more dry, having small wrinkles and they were appearing darker with a blue/ purple tone. I&#x27;m so happy I bought the Ultrax lab eye bloom under eye cream because I&#x27;ve been noticing some changes. My under eyes are so much more hydrated. I noticed my this one specific wrinkle diminishing and as well as the darkness. It reduces puffiness and just makes me look like I had a couple of more hours of sleep.</li>
    <li> i saw a difference right away after i start using this product.I&#x27;ve been using many eyes cream and that one so far works the best.&lt;br /&gt;i will continue using this product and recommend to anyone who is experiencing dark circles and.The skin is softer and i look restless.&lt;br /&gt;Great work!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Ultrax Labs Eye Bloom Cream over 6 weeks and it did not reduce the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It reduced the puffiness under my eyes and reduced the fine lines. It absorbs quickly and keeps my eyes looking fresh all day.  You use so very little it should last a long time.  You simply press down on the white lid and the cream emerges.  Don&#x27;t press too hard or you will extract too much cream.  Gently press the top of the lid to extract just a little cream at a time.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  After feeling self-conscious about my sunken-looking eyes FOREVER, I finally started trying creams to reduce dark circles.  It took me a long time to find this, but it&#x27;s the only one that has ever worked.  Give it a week or two, and your whole face will change.</li>
    <li> I love it! My Eyes are Brighter, the lines (Wrinkles) around my eyes are gone &amp; my skin is tighter and Smoother than ever &amp; dark circles NO MORE!!! I look (and Feel) TEN YEARS YOUNGER@@!!!!~</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for dark circles, it actually dried my skin around the eyes.</li>
    <li> One of the best products I have ever used for dark spots. It was easy to use and exceeded my expectations.</li>
