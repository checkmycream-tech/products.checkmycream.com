      <li>Best soap ever!</li>
      <li>Pears Soap is an excellent, time-tested product.  </li>
      <li>Demand the best quality.</li>
      <li>Hadn&#x27;t used Pears for awhile and was looking forward to that wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>It is also great for bathing.</li>
      <li>This soap is really great.</li>
      <li>My face always feels and looks great after using it.  </li>
      <li>I was delighted to find it again through Amazon.com.   </li>
      <li>And I loved the herbal scent.  </li>
      <li>This is good for the skin?  </li>
      <li>Very pleased with my purchase</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>it was truly one of a kind Farewell....</li>
      <li>To each his own.</li>
      <li>that nice.  </li>
      <li>It is no longer the wonderful, natural product we all knew and loved.    </li>
      <li>I have run into it before in England and Africa and always liked it, but I&#x27;m not the soap buyer at my house.</li>
      <li>Pears was a great mild soap/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is safe and a effective product.</li>
      <li>It is an excellent product, healthy &amp; natural &amp; you can see thru it.</li>
      <li>A totally wonderful soap completely ruined after more than 200 years.</li>
      <li>we all know and love.  </li>
      <li>and we love it.  </li>
      <li>this has been removed from most foods because of harmful side-effects so why would anyone want to absorb it thru the skin into their blood stream?  </li>
      <li>I used this as a facial cleansing bar and it was the best cleanser I have ever used on my face.</li>
      <li>Even better, my daughter has discovered that glycerin based soaps, like Pears, relieve her son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
      <li>Always love this doap</li>
      <li>I fell in love with Pears liquid soap when in England.  </li>
      <li>but it is still my most cherished soap.  </li>
      <li>This soap kept my face soft,smooth,even toned and blemish free for years!</li>
      <li>I smelled it again just to be sure and then realized that it smelled just like insecticide.</li>
      <li>Gone was the refreshing spicy herbal scent which now smells more like an insecticide.</li>
      <li>I used to love Pears soap as I kid.</li>
      <li>The original Pears deluxe soap.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much that I searched online to learn more about it and discover what its scent is called.</li>
      <li>Pears has that special aroma without overwhelming the senses.</li>
      <li>find it interesting, though not necessarily bad, to see that it&#x27;s made in India (that&#x27;s in the description).</li>
      <li>I find it still a fine hand soap.</li>
      <li>, caused a HUGE discomfort</li>
      <li>Not only did i buy the soap for &amp;#34;gentle care&amp;#34; I bought it as an alternative to netrogena gental care, which is a great product, I just had a tattoo done</li>
      <li>This is such a great soap.  </li>
      <li>This has a great scent, but leaves a soapy white film in the shower.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s really nothing left of this bar that made it so enduring and wonderful.</li>
      <li>Pears&#x27; transparent soap seems to be among the latest to join the ranks of products, like HP Sauce and Sunlight soap, once proudly made in the UK and now farmed out to other manufacturers.</li>
      <li>I  have always loved Pears Soap and have used it for over 60 years, first at my grandparents and later in my own household.  </li>
      <li>original formula for 200 years had 8 ingredients.  </li>
      <li>I want a return to the original Pear&#x27;s soap formula.  </li>
      <li>You will also find a complete history of the soap there which is very interesting.</li>
      <li>But nothing could compare to the original Pears Soap</li>
      <li>This soap is clean, pure and made with safe ingredients.</li>
      <li>As I cannot use perfumes, I find my special fragrance through soap.</li>
      <li>My drugstore is special.</li>
      <li>Absolutely nothing worked better.</li>
      <li>Had better luck with the glycerin soap at Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a nice gentle, pure, chemical-free soap.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much, the seller delievered on time!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem any different than what I remembered, but we are both enthusiastic about its unique properties and fragrance.</li>
      <li>I now use Neutrogena facial cleansing bar which is pretty good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Pears Soap is the natural way to beautiful skin because it is made from pure ingredients, glycerin, natural oils, rosemary, cedar and thyme.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite a nasty-smelling formulation, reminiscent of some kind of insecticide or industrial cleaning product.</li>
      <li>change is noticeable, even without a reading of the new ingredients, for in their experimenting Hindustan Unilever have produced something truly remarkable: a glycerin-based soap that actually dries out your skin.</li>
      <li>I will never buy it again unless I am absolutely assured that it has been reformulated to its original quality.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m going to say that it should not get the right to be called soap.</li>
      <li>Mine is going right into the trash.....</li>
      <li>It still doesn&#x27;t smell right</li>
      <li>I came to this site not because I was looking for soap but because my wife brought home a pack of Pears soap earlier this summer and it has quickly become our favorite soap.</li>
      <li>I received my Pears soap super fast.</li>
      <li>As a cleanser, it is gentle and mild.</li>
      <li>Such a shame for a great 220-year-old brand, which Unilever has totally ruined.</li>
      <li>Lots of very nice products are made in India, but I&#x27;m not sure this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very very sensative skin.  </li>
      <li>It is much softer than the original and gets used up much faster.</li>
      <li>Soaps\\&quot; that I got on Amazon - it was my first package with one of the new formulations - and I finally was able to trace a rash I&#x27;ve been getting to that soap!</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be more technical, this information is from the product description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Pears Soap, it is the only soap that I can use without drying out my skin.</li>
      <li>I first ran across Pears soap at the dollar tree (a dollar store), after trying it the first time I ran back to get more.</li>
      <li>I just received my first order of this soap.  </li>
      <li>The money I paid for this product was a tad higher compared to other products in this category, but I&#x27;ve always liked to use Pears products, especially since it is suggested by so many dermatologists.</li>
      <li>Original ingredients: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.    </li>
      <li>While I never found the original Pears&#x27; soap to be overly moisturizing, neither did it outright strip my skin of its vital moisture barrier and leave it gasping as this version does.</li>
      <li>It has a gently clean smell like a garden on a  spring night--rosemary and thyme wafting on soft breezes.</li>
      <li>ANYONE knows where to get the ORIGINAL Pears Soap (not a new formula that just says \\&quot;original\\&quot; - words are so cheap), I would really like to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gone were all the natural skin loving ingredients which were replaced cheap harsh detergents.</li>
      <li>I would be interested in seeing how much the sales figures have crashed already.</li>
      <li>and now I have to order online with large shipping costs.  </li>
      <li>For more than 200 years, each bar has been mellowed and aged for three months until reaching a pure transparency.</li>
      <li>It really reminds me of the soap my grandmother used.</li>
      <li>but it REALLY really doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>Gentle on the skin, not drying at all.</li>
      <li>If you have any sort of skin condition, be warned -- this soap absolutely will bring it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I find a product I really like and it disappears, I always turn to Amazon.</li>
      <li>Works very well on my skin.</li>
      <li>If you have a Dollar Tree in your area, you can go to the website and order Pears and have it shipped to your local store for free.</li>
      <li>and now it&#x27;s scaring, thanks a lot pears ruined my tattoo</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aside from the different ingredients, they haven&#x27;t managed to duplicate the original fragrance, and that&#x27;s the part that bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not same as original.  </li>
      <li>, like so many other products do these days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, like the latter it lathers up well and washes away clean.</li>

    <li> Gentle on the skin, not drying at all.</li>
    <li> I first ran across Pears soap at the dollar tree (a dollar store), after trying it the first time I ran back to get more. Unfortunately there were apparently people more familiar with the product than myself. The entire stock was gone and none was to be had. I was delighted to find it again through Amazon.com.   This soap is clean, pure and made with safe ingredients. Using a glycerin base instead of lye it is safe for the whole family, it&#x27;s all we use and we love it.  Rev. Bruce Richards  Priest of the Correllian Nativist Tradition</li>
    <li> I gave this soap 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I did not enjoy the smell as much as the green Pears Oil Soap. However, like the latter it lathers up well and washes away clean. I love the soap, but I prefer the green Pears myself. You won&#x27;t go wrong with either.</li>
    <li> I purchased Pears Soap assuming it&#x27;s the Pears soap we all know and love.  WRONG.  They have changed the soap completely.  It&#x27;s smelly, doesn&#x27;t lather as well, and a smaller bar.  I HATE it.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with Pears liquid soap when in England.  Since the liquid is apparently not available in the U.S., I bought the Pears bars.  What a mistake!  This soap smells AWFUL!  Like insect repellant only not that nice.  I threw all three bars away.  It doesn&#x27;t even rate one star.</li>
    <li> original formula for 200 years had 8 ingredients.  Now it has 24!&lt;br /&gt;it is not delightfully mild smelling or long lasting.  I urge you to research this product before buying.  I learned the hard way.  It is not what you have fond memories of.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The new Pears soap is an absolute disaster. It stinks and irritates my skin! I will never buy it again unless I am absolutely assured that it has been reformulated to its original quality. Too bad -- I&#x27;ve used it for over fifty years. It&#x27;s all Dr. Bronners for me now!</li>
    <li> Slightly less than one year ago (late September 2009) I was getting low on Pears, but I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local Denver, Colorado, USA, area stores, so I bought a 12-bar carton from Amazon. Now I only have 4 bars left, and so today I bought some bars at a local Dollar Tree store. I noticed the packaging changes, but I didn&#x27;t realize the extent of the disaster until I got home, compared a new box with an old, and saw the strange new ingredient list. That motivated me to open a new box, which revealed the new plastic/cellophane wrapping. I opened it and was greeted by the horrible new odor! It&#x27;s quite a nasty-smelling formulation, reminiscent of some kind of insecticide or industrial cleaning product. I immediately returned the bars. Unfortunately, this probably means that Amazon also no longer has the old formula, unless a savvy and honest seller specifically says that they have the original product. Such a shame for a great 220-year-old brand, which Unilever has totally ruined. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying the horrific \\&quot;New Pears\\&quot; formula.</li>
    <li> I just had a shower with this new stuff (refuse to give it a title) after only 4 showers it is virtually gone, they have reduced the size by a third and increased the price. I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much but the quality is so poor that you are lucky to get a bar to last a week. It still doesn&#x27;t smell right and it brings my son&#x27;s eczema out. I have decided to stop buying it after using it for virtually all my adult life. In 10 years time when all of pears loyal users have deserted the brand and sales of Pears are at rock bottom, the directors at Unilever will be sat round in their boardroom scratching their heads wondering where it all went wrong. Well it all went wrong when you fixed something that wasn&#x27;t actually broken in order to save a few pennies. I would be interested in seeing how much the sales figures have crashed already.</li>
    <li> The new formula has a different smell, texture, colour, shape, and size compared to regular pears soap. I prefer closer to the normal formula.</li>
    <li> Too bad, another good product disappears in a fog of lies and deliberately misleading promotional material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, the ingredients on the package that I received are not those listed in the description of this product. And yet mine are different from those that reviewer Private listed, too. Here&#x27;s what my package says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Sodium Palm Kernelate, Sorbitol, Sodium Rosinate, Sodium Palmate, Glycerin, Sodium Stearate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-4, Alcholo Denat., Sodium Chloride, Fragrance, Sodium metabisulfite, Tetrasodium Etidronate, Tetrasodium EDTA, BHT, Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis Leaf (Rosemary) Extract, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 10 (CI 47005), D&amp;C Red No. 300 (CI 17200)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To their credit, at least they list \\&quot;Water\\&quot;, and not \\&quot;Aqua\\&quot;, like so many other products do these days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the different ingredients, they haven&#x27;t managed to duplicate the original fragrance, and that&#x27;s the part that bothers me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it interesting, though not necessarily bad, to see that it&#x27;s made in India (that&#x27;s in the description). Lots of very nice products are made in India, but I&#x27;m not sure this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If ANYONE knows where to get the ORIGINAL Pears Soap (not a new formula that just says \\&quot;original\\&quot; - words are so cheap), I would really like to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a package of one of the other \\&quot;Pears Soaps\\&quot; that I got on Amazon - it was my first package with one of the new formulations - and I finally was able to trace a rash I&#x27;ve been getting to that soap! I never got a rash from Pears before, but I was careful to eliminate other possible causes in my testing and there&#x27;s no doubt. However, the soap reviewed here is yet another formulation and I haven&#x27;t tried it, yet. I&#x27;ll report back here if I get a rash from it (I hope not!). All I can say is \\&quot;unbelievable\\&quot;. Manufacturers are playing around with our health so that their senior executive compensation can set new records. I&#x27;m beyond disgusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using all Pears Soap for a while to see if anything else was causing my rash (laundry detergent, baby powder, etc.), and I wasn&#x27;t getting any rash. I started using this soap with the ingredients above, and the rash came back in two days. Well, sorry to say, that&#x27;s the end of Pears Soap for me.nior executive compensation can set new records. I&#x27;m beyond disgusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using all Pears Soap for a while to see if anything else was causing my rash (laundry detergent, baby powder, etc.), and I wasn&#x27;t getting any rash.

    <li> Last year they changed the 200 year old formula.  The new formula smells like a combination of turpentine and incense.</li>
    <li> This is it! The original Pears deluxe soap. Often imitated, never duplicated. Demand the best quality. Don&#x27;t be fooled by imitations! Feel the difference that Pears makes!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much, the seller delievered on time! Best soap ever! Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I will order again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of this new redone soap. It smells terrible!!! It took me only a second to throw it into a trash. Awful! Where can I buy the old formula?</li>
    <li> I have used Pears soap for years and years.  I started using it when my daughter was small and it was the only soap that didn&#x27;t irritate her skin.  And I loved the herbal scent.  I had a big carton of it that I finally used up and just recently ordered more.  Come to find out, they changed the formula and it&#x27;s all chemically now.  No more herbal scent.  And the bar is flatter.  It hardly seems like the same soap.  I have to look at the picture on the box to remind myself that it&#x27;s Pears Soap . . . or is it?</li>
    <li> This is a poor substitute of the original product, changed since 2009.    The fragrance is insecticide, the after wash feels sticky.    This is a very unfortunate turn of events.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand what the fuss is about over this soap. This soap contains \\&quot;Rosin\\&quot; which is unsafe for use in cosmetics. It is a known human immune system toxicant as well as a possible mutagen and carcinogen (i.e. linked to cause cancer). Pears also contains \\&quot;parfum\\&quot; which is a skin irritant/allergen and there are millions of types of scents that can be simply labelled \\&quot;parfum\\&quot; without telling us what is exactly in it. [...]</li>
    <li> I like the glycerine soap but this stuff smells bad. Almost like medicated dandruff shampoo smells.</li>
    <li> I love Pears Soap, it is the only soap that I can use without drying out my skin. I have used it for years but am finding it more and more difficult to find.  If you have a Dollar Tree in your area, you can go to the website and order Pears and have it shipped to your local store for free. It is only a dollar a bar, the only downfall is that you have to purchase it by the case.</li>
    <li> Pears&#x27; transparent soap seems to be among the latest to join the ranks of products, like HP Sauce and Sunlight soap, once proudly made in the UK and now farmed out to other manufacturers. While HP Sauce retains its basic flavour (as does Sunlight, presumably -- I haven&#x27;t tasted it lately), Pears has been reconfigured, its simple ingredients giving way to a raspy new formula involving greater use of irritating chemicals and colourants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The change is noticeable, even without a reading of the new ingredients, for in their experimenting Hindustan Unilever have produced something truly remarkable: a glycerin-based soap that actually dries out your skin. While I never found the original Pears&#x27; soap to be overly moisturizing, neither did it outright strip my skin of its vital moisture barrier and leave it gasping as this version does. If you have any sort of skin condition, be warned -- this soap absolutely will bring it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My various researches into the reformulation have yielded such manufacturer responses as a need to increase production efficiency along with improved customer \\&quot;benefits\\&quot;  which now seem to include dry, itchy skin and allergic reactions. Had the manufacturer wanted to cut back on expensive, hard-to-obtain ingredients, Pears could simply have been made as a pure glycerin soap with only a few of the traditional ingredients (and perhaps tea as a colourant, if needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a move would doubtless have ignited controversy, but a pared-down reformulation would&#x27;ve preserved the soap&#x27;s simple, natural qualities; major selling points in a society increasingly concerned with such things. Alas, they&#x27;ve set their chemists upon it and this cellophane-wrapped, sandalwood-scented blob of sandpaper is the end result.</li>
    <li> Pears Soap is an excellent, time-tested product.  It has withstood the test of time. (Thomas Pears went down with the Titanic.)  It is gentle on the skin - gentle enough to use on my face.  Even better, my daughter has discovered that glycerin based soaps, like Pears, relieve her son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realised that Pears had changed the formulation of its transparent soap until I bought this.  Dear God, what were they thinking of?  It now smells of insect repellent and makes my skin itch and flake.  I wouldn&#x27;t even use this on the dog.  Shame on you, Unilever!</li>
    <li> Up until 2010 I had been a faithful user of Pears Orignal soap for over 25 years. I used this as a facial cleansing bar and it was the best cleanser I have ever used on my face. This soap kept my face soft,smooth,even toned and blemish free for years! People would often complaint me on my glowing \\&quot;flawless\\&quot; complexion. And I would tell them that I swear by Pears Soap. Absolutely nothing worked better. Then in early 2010 I picked up a few bars at my local Dollar Tree and I noticed the formula completely changed! Gone were all the natural skin loving ingredients which were replaced cheap harsh detergents. Gone was the refreshing spicy herbal scent which now smells more like an insecticide. I used this on my face twice and it made my skin feel dry, and my skin was flaking. A totally wonderful soap completely ruined after more than 200 years. In my opinion this is a tragedy. I no longer use Pears I won&#x27;t touch it. I now use Neutrogena facial cleansing bar which is pretty good. But nothing could compare to the original Pears Soap it was truly one of a kind Farewell....</li>
    <li> Always love this doap</li>
    <li> I too had been looking for this soap. I was disappointed to find it is was now being made in India rather than England with a new formula. The new formula was very bad, but as of March 2010 Pears is changing to a version much closer to the original.  Check Wikipedia for old and new ingredients. You will also find a complete history of the soap there which is very interesting.</li>
    <li> Pears soap!, I&#x27;m going to say that it should not get the right to be called soap. The problem is advertised as &amp;#34;gental care&amp;#34; and it even mimics the same qualities as soap but it REALLY really doesn&#x27;t.  MY experience lead to THE WORST outbreak of eczema I have ever had. Not only did i buy the soap for &amp;#34;gentle care&amp;#34; I bought it as an alternative to netrogena gental care, which is a great product, I just had a tattoo done and now it&#x27;s scaring, thanks a lot pears ruined my tattoo, caused a HUGE discomfort and I hope you add a warning to your product</li>
    <li> I  have always loved Pears Soap and have used it for over 60 years, first at my grandparents and later in my own household.  Yes, it did change a little, it is not quite like the old one but it is still my most cherished soap.  I am so thankful that it still exist</li>
    <li> I came to this site not because I was looking for soap but because my wife brought home a pack of Pears soap earlier this summer and it has quickly become our favorite soap. I have run into it before in England and Africa and always liked it, but I&#x27;m not the soap buyer at my house. It doesn&#x27;t seem any different than what I remembered, but we are both enthusiastic about its unique properties and fragrance. It is the best smelling soap I have ever encountered! I liked it so much that I searched online to learn more about it and discover what its scent is called. I was very surprised that all the reviews of it are not positive. To each his own. I love it!</li>
    <li> Pears was a great mild soap/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new Formula has turned it into a chemical bar that lasts half as long as the original,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass</li>
    <li> My drugstore is special. It&#x27;s like an old-time drugstore--thus drugstore, not pharmacy. Because it carries all sorts of products, often those products will disappear after awhile. When I find a product I really like and it disappears, I always turn to Amazon. And always, Amazon satisfies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I find Pears Soap once again. As I cannot use perfumes, I find my special fragrance through soap. Pears has that special aroma without overwhelming the senses. It has a gently clean smell like a garden on a  spring night--rosemary and thyme wafting on soft breezes. It really reminds me of the soap my grandmother used. So it also smells of grandmothers. As a cleanser, it is gentle and mild. A perfect product all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be more technical, this information is from the product description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Pears Soap is the natural way to beautiful skin because it is made from pure ingredients, glycerin, natural oils, rosemary, cedar and thyme. For more than 200 years, each bar has been mellowed and aged for three months until reaching a pure transparency. Founded in 1789.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This soap smells like tar - had to throw it out.  Would not recommend this product to anybody.  Had better luck with the glycerin soap at Whole Foods.</li>
    <li> I would never buy this soap again. The bars stored in my cabinet made my bathroom smell like gasoline! Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!  After three days of use, my face, neck and chest broke out in hives. I will not recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This has a great scent, but leaves a soapy white film in the shower. It was on a shower caddy above the shower handle and coated it with this white film. Yuck.</li>
    <li> The package arrived earlier than expected and it is exactly as mentioned. i.e. 3 Pears Soaps in one package. However, the Soap&#x27;s flavor is slightly different from the ones I bought in India.</li>
    <li> Pears soap&#x27;s formula has changed as of 2009.  It is no longer the wonderful, natural product we all knew and loved.    Original ingredients: Sodium Palmitate, Natural Rosin, Glycerine, Water, Sodium Cocoate, Rosemary Extract, Thyme Extract, Pears Fragrance Essence.    New ingredients: Sorbitol, Aqua, Sodium Palmate/stearate, Sodium Palmkernelate, Sodium Rosinate, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, PEG-4, Alcohol, Glycerin, Perfume, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Meta Bisulfite, Etidronic acid, Tetra Sodium EDTA, BHT, Cl 12490, Cl 47005, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Salicylate, Cinnamal, Eugenol, Limonene, Linalool.</li>
    <li> The new formula smells like turpentine. It is much softer than the original and gets used up much faster.</li>
    <li> I just received my first order of this soap.  I was hoping for a nice gentle, pure, chemical-free soap.  It claims to be a glycerine soap, but Amazon chooses not to list the other ingredients, some of which are pretty nasty.  However, they are listed on the side of the box.  Like sodium meta bisulfite...this has been removed from most foods because of harmful side-effects so why would anyone want to absorb it thru the skin into their blood stream?  Also contains propylene glycol which you will find in anti-freeze. This is good for the skin?  The soap is made in India and I guess they have different standards for \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; soap.  Mine is going right into the trash.....too much trouble to return.</li>
    <li> I used to love Pears soap as I kid. I would see it around the house a lot, and seeing it brought back memories. When I bought some pears In the store and brought it home, I was shocked. It smells of something like Insect Repellent. I can still smell something like the Original Pears, but this is just a Partially Butchered Version. A little bit disappointed...</li>
    <li> Not same as original.  Strips everything but the soul off your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap recently because I like clear, glycerine soaps like Neutrogena. I was getting ready to take a nice relaxing bath tonight, opened the soap, smelled it and was shocked at the terrible smell. I smelled it again just to be sure and then realized that it smelled just like insecticide. It does not smell spicy, it smells like Pine Tar. Yuck!</li>
    <li> I have very very sensative skin.  I can use Pears for facial cleansing with no problems.  It does not contain soap.  It is also great for bathing.</li>
    <li> This soap is really great. I use it especially for hand washing. My hands do not get dry when I use this.</li>
    <li> I have used Pears soap for 35years and don&#x27;t see any reason to stop however there has been none available in New Zealand for the last 4 months.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula and the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Pears smells like insect killer. Really.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t used Pears for awhile and was looking forward to that wonderful scent. Now it smells like...tar? I&#x27;m just going to toss it - it wasn&#x27;t that expensive and life&#x27;s too short to use bad soap.</li>
    <li> The Pears brand may have been over 200 years old like it states on the box, but this soap has little to do with it other than apperance. Not only is it now a chemical &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; with changed formula (sodium laureth sulfate?! no real soap needs that), but it should probably not be considered a real soap at all but a detergent bar. Feeling nostalgic of my old favorite soap, I bought a few anyway, thinking it may at least smell the same. Wrong. Like someone else has noted, this thing now smells like insecticides. It&#x27;s anything but the old fragrant bouquet that is so essential to the Pears experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s really nothing left of this bar that made it so enduring and wonderful. It makes me angry and sad. Why not just do a different product, instead of dragging the brand through the mud? Whoever did this had no idea what this brand is about, and killed a classic.</li>
    <li> I want a return to the original Pear&#x27;s soap formula.  This &amp;#34;gentle care&amp;#34; formula is NOT original Pear&#x27;s Soap.  A disaster.</li>
    <li> I was addicted to this bath soap after using it for about 7 years. Now I&#x27;ve moved over it, but this soap is definitely something that I might always go back to.    The money I paid for this product was a tad higher compared to other products in this category, but I&#x27;ve always liked to use Pears products, especially since it is suggested by so many dermatologists.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, disappointed my local drug store stopped carrying it and now I have to order online with large shipping costs.  Can&#x27;t live without it though.</li>
    <li> This is such a great soap.  My face always feels and looks great after using it.  I would recommend this soap to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I received my Pears soap super fast. It is an excellent product, healthy &amp; natural &amp; you can see thru it. Very pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> Works very well on my skin. I would recommend it to anyone to use. It is safe and a effective product.</li>
    <li> Pears is a transparent soap that has gone through a number of ingredient and means of manufacturing changes in recent years that I am not familiar with since I am new to it.  I find it still a fine hand soap.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap we use.</li>
