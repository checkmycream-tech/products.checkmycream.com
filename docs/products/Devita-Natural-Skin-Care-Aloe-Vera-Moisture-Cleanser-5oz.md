      <li>I love love</li>
      <li>and I have to confess I&#x27;m in love with this brand.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE that this face wash comes in a glass bottle</li>
      <li>and I hope Devita keeps it that way :)</li>
      <li>Devita, at this price point, you can do better.</li>
      <li>all my bottles on the dresser look the same, LOL!  </li>
      <li>I love the gel consistency.  </li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;ve come to love it.  </li>
      <li>It removes makeup better than most cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, and my skin feels the way it&#x27;s supposed to: Clean, but not stripped.</li>
      <li>Light and refreshing</li>

      <li>Most importantly, it has no chemicals or sulfates, so I don&#x27;t break out.  </li>
      <li>I love how clean my skin feels after using this.</li>
      <li>I like the scent of this product and don&#x27;t find it too strong, but it may be something you have to get used to.  </li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t find it too strong.</li>
      <li>Amazing product, and fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I have also used the rose toner but don&#x27;t like it as much as this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for something frag free and not so &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting a bunch of bizarre chemicals on my face.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a light, but effective cleanser.</li>
      <li>My skin feels clean and comfortable after I rinse.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and balanced.</li>
      <li>It makes sense that an aloe-based cleanser made out of natural ingredients would be better for the skin, and it works!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
      <li>Good for dry skin...</li>
      <li>this is one of my favorite natural face washes.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite cleanser.  </li>
      <li>But this Devita natural cleanser is very nice and cleans well, especially on my having rosacea face...</li>
      <li>I also really like the floral scent it has and that it rinses away clean with no residue.  </li>
      <li>This product had far too strong of a fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love the Devita moisturizers and sun screen, but this falls short.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser is so gentle that it does not sting!  </li>
      <li>The first one (I will not give the name of  brand here) was leaving an oily feeling after cleansing.</li>
      <li>It actually cleans all the make up off my face, even most of the gel liner that requires an oil based cleanser to remove.  </li>
      <li>This cleanser actually is gentle!  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>If you struggle with cream cleansers and find that most gel cleansers dry out or irritate your skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Devita line for about 3 months now, and I really like it.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY suggest you try this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!  </li>
      <li>This product has so much perfume in it</li>
      <li>Very practical...</li>
      <li>although I&#x27;ve used the solar moisturizer for years) and really do notice a difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the whole Devita line for about 2 months now (</li>
      <li>Still recommend this for a gentle gel cleanser.  </li>
      <li>As much as I like this face wash, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like it to be.  </li>
      <li>Makes my whole shower smell like a spa.</li>
      <li>It is the one product I can absolutely rely on.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s enough to take off light make up.</li>
      <li>it is not irritating and non drying.</li>
      <li>All in all, I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t mind too much although I might try a creamier cleanser once I finish this bottle.  </li>
      <li>I use this along with dead sea salts for exfoliation, and I use Devita&#x27;s Moroccan Rose Toner and Sanre Skinfood Sparkling Aloe Moisturizer</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with a couple other Devita products, but this is not one of them.</li>
      <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Personally going to alternate between this cleanser and something more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, a decent product.</li>
      <li>This gentle cleanser has a heavenly (and all natural!)</li>
      <li>I really like this face wash because it&#x27;s just a simple and gentle cleanser</li>
      <li>and I have combination skin that is very sensitive and</li>
      <li>Occasionally I&#x27;ll try something new to see if I like a different product better, but I always come back to this one.  </li>
      <li>I would agree with other reviewers on here that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin SUPER moisturized, but that isn&#x27;t something that I consider to be a problem since I&#x27;m going to apply moisturizer after I was my face anyway.  </li>
      <li>these natural products don&#x27;t irritate me at all.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how it could be natural.</li>
      <li>and it makes the skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>I too have sensitive skin and this product does not cause any breakout or reaction.</li>
      <li>I have ULTRA sensitive acne prone/rosacea skin.  </li>
      <li>My face feels clean but not squeeky nor tight after.  </li>
      <li>And since it&#x27;s called the Aloe Vera Moisture Cleanser, I guess I expected a little more.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I would love to be improved in this product is wastage: you need to use too much in order to clean/cover face and neck, when with other cleansers you use about four times less of the cleanser (using the same method: rinse with water).</li>
      <li>My cheeks and nose tend to be really dry and flaky and it almost feels like the cleanser strips too much from those areas of my face.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best cleanser on the market!  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  It softens and hydrates the skin and it makes the skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I noticed the difference in my skin withing a few days. My skin protests if I&#x27;m a day without it!</li>
    <li> The pump stopped functioning half way through :-( Otherwise, a decent product.</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin really bad.  Gave this to my friend that loves this product.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite natural face washes. it is not irritating and non drying. I have acne prone skin. I LOVE that this face wash comes in a glass bottle and I hope Devita keeps it that way :)</li>
    <li> This product has so much perfume in it I can&#x27;t imagine how it could be natural. It&#x27;s not drying but it&#x27;s also not very moisturizing. It is not what I was looking for in a facial wash</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive and dry skin and mostly relied on cetaphil in the past, which I didn&#x27;t realize was way too drying and harsh for my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using the whole Devita line for about 2 months now (although I&#x27;ve used the solar moisturizer for years) and really do notice a difference.  It makes sense that an aloe-based cleanser made out of natural ingredients would be better for the skin, and it works!</li>
    <li> I have been told that I shouldn&#x27;t use a make-up product containing acid after I have done tattoos on my face. This is the second cleanser I have tried which is without acid. The first one (I will not give the name of  brand here) was leaving an oily feeling after cleansing. But this Devita natural cleanser is very nice and cleans well, especially on my having rosacea face... The only thing I would love to be improved in this product is wastage: you need to use too much in order to clean/cover face and neck, when with other cleansers you use about four times less of the cleanser (using the same method: rinse with water). I give anyhow 5 stars, because it does its job very good, even with more product wastage...</li>
    <li> Love this product! Light and refreshing</li>
    <li> Good consistency...Good for dry skin...Nice packaging..Good price...Good for a gift to others...Very practical...Will order again in the near future..Thank you..</li>
    <li> I have purchased this 2 or 3 times. I love it!  use it for removing makeup then follow with a cleanser. I have oily skin and I was afraid of using an &#x27;oily&#x27; product on my face...but I am so glad I tried it! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the Devita moisturizers and sun screen, but this falls short.  It has a very strong soapy odor and thick base.  It&#x27;s almost like using dish soap!  I&#x27;ll keep looking for something frag free and not so &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This product had far too strong of a fragrance. It was unnerving. I imagine that anyone with moderate to severe fragrance or chemical sensitivity would have trouble with this product.  Also, the bottle was glass (which I like from a BPA standpoint), and it accidentally broke when I placed it on a marble counter at an angle. It toppled over before I had finished the product. I was actually kind of relieved that this happened, as it absolved me of the guilt that I would have felt had I just thrown it away.  Devita, at this price point, you can do better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Devita product for years.  Occasionally I&#x27;ll try something new to see if I like a different product better, but I always come back to this one.  I tend to have skin that is either oily or dry depending on my cycle. I do experience some dryness after using (especially in winter when I am battling dry skin in general), similar to what other reviewers have commented on.  However, it isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as some other products I&#x27;ve tried.  And again, if your skin is dry, use a moisturizer or moisturizing serum.  It&#x27;s one of the best things you can do for your skin anyway.  I like the scent of this product and don&#x27;t find it too strong, but it may be something you have to get used to.  I have also used the rose toner but don&#x27;t like it as much as this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Made with top notch ingredients and perfect for those with sensitive skin! It smells wonderful too! Makes my whole shower smell like a spa.</li>
    <li> I stopped using it, made my sick feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Threw away return stuff, can not return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Devita line for about 3 months now, and I really like it. I love that it&#x27;s natural and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting a bunch of bizarre chemicals on my face. It removes makeup better than most cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, and my skin feels the way it&#x27;s supposed to: Clean, but not stripped. It takes very little, so a container of this lasts a long time. I have pretty sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. I would recommend it to others for sure!</li>
    <li> A few months ago I tried the Devita anti-aging \\&quot;try me\\&quot; kit. The products were all very nice, but my favorite was the Aloe Moisture Cleanser. It cleans my skin so well, but without being too harsh.  I too have sensitive skin and this product does not cause any breakout or reaction. It also smells divine! All in all, I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This gentle cleanser has a heavenly (and all natural!) scent, is entirely free of all synthetics, leaves your skin delightfully supple and fresh!  I also use it on my baby&#x27;s butt when it gets raw on occasion and soap starts stinging.  This cleanser is so gentle that it does not sting!  The best thing is that EACH ingredient is entirely natural, and this is a non-toxic, very safe product.  I love love love DeVita&#x27;s skin care products and their non-toxic, all-natural ingredients!  This is head and shoulders above anything else I have ever used for my face.  I would only make one suggestion to DeVita -- to use different color and shape containers for their products.  DeVita is the only brand I use now, and all my bottles on the dresser look the same, LOL!  Making it necessary every time to read the product name as I pick it up!</li>
    <li> I have used the Devita aloe vera cleanser for several years.  My face feels clean but not squeeky nor tight after.  Highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a light, but effective cleanser.</li>
    <li> This gets everything off my skin, and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all!  I use this along with dead sea salts for exfoliation, and I use Devita&#x27;s Moroccan Rose Toner and Sanre Skinfood Sparkling Aloe Moisturizer, it&#x27;s the best combination for skin care I&#x27;ve found in all the years I&#x27;ve been using skincare products!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, and fast delivery! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Great Vegan product. I love how clean my skin feels after using this. I have been using this for a while. I have noticed my face has cleared up but if i miss a day i instantly break out.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cleanser.  Great for sensitive skin.  It actually cleans all the make up off my face, even most of the gel liner that requires an oil based cleanser to remove.  Most importantly, it has no chemicals or sulfates, so I don&#x27;t break out.  It is the one product I can absolutely rely on.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is absolutely amazing! I was recommended this product from a family member and I absolutely love it! Leaves my skin feeling clean and balanced. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product. I like how it smells, I don&#x27;t find it too strong. But, it&#x27;s way too drying. I have normal to dry skin and this gave me red dry patches. I&#x27;m in love with a couple other Devita products, but this is not one of them.</li>
    <li> I have ULTRA sensitive acne prone/rosacea skin.  I mean even cleansers like Cetaphil or \\&quot;gentle cleansers\\&quot; make my skin burn.  This cleanser actually is gentle!  My skin feels clean and comfortable after I rinse.  I would agree with other reviewers on here that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin SUPER moisturized, but that isn&#x27;t something that I consider to be a problem since I&#x27;m going to apply moisturizer after I was my face anyway.  What is important is that it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry or tight.  I also really like the floral scent it has and that it rinses away clean with no residue.  I love the gel consistency.  If you struggle with cream cleansers and find that most gel cleansers dry out or irritate your skin I HIGHLY suggest you try this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!  Finding in the winter months that this cleanser is a bit drying not a lot, but enough to make me think that daily use in the colder months may be too much.  Again, if you moisturize religiously (day &amp; night everyday!) this probably won&#x27;t be the case for you.  Still recommend this for a gentle gel cleanser.  Personally going to alternate between this cleanser and something more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love this product recommend it to any one</li>
    <li> Always liked this cleanser. I never break out with it and it&#x27;s enough to take off light make up.</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, it makes her happy, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I discovered Devita skin care products over a month ago and I have to confess I&#x27;m in love with this brand.  I&#x27;m an Asian-American woman in my late 20s and I have combination skin that is very sensitive and these natural products don&#x27;t irritate me at all.  I really like this face wash because it&#x27;s just a simple and gentle cleanser and it&#x27;s surprisingly good at removing excess makeup.  And in case you&#x27;re interested, this product has a flowery and herbal scent which took me a few days to get used to but now I&#x27;ve come to love it.  Also, the cleanser itself is a clear gel-like consistency that creates a little lather when you massage it into the face.  As much as I like this face wash, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like it to be.  And since it&#x27;s called the Aloe Vera Moisture Cleanser, I guess I expected a little more.  My cheeks and nose tend to be really dry and flaky and it almost feels like the cleanser strips too much from those areas of my face.  I use a heavy moisturizer right after so I don&#x27;t mind too much although I might try a creamier cleanser once I finish this bottle.  Hope this helps!</li>
