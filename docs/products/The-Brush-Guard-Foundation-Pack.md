      <li>Work just as good as other brand but a more reasonable price.</li>

      <li>Very affordable.  </li>
      <li>fast shipment</li>
      <li>really looking for the ones that come with the Lancôme brushes.</li>
      <li>I just wish the Guards shrunk back to their original form.</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re like new!  </li>
      <li>All my brushes look brand new as if they were never used!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really helpful when transporting the brushes and they dry faster and keep their original shapes.</li>
      <li>These are decent for traveling and maintaining the shape of brushes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>The medium foundation brush guards really do fit a wide range of brushes.</li>
      <li>i always loved the idea of proudly owning and applying makeup with professional (expensive) make-up brushes but was confused about their care.  </li>
      <li>and it works my makeup brushes looks new</li>
      <li>I am very familiar with the brush guard for the past 3 years or so.</li>
      <li>tried these on a few of my average-sized powder brushes and I was surprised at how well they fit.</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive, would totally recommend to friends.</li>
      <li>Not only did I get a prompt reply, but I received an completely new package in the mail as well.</li>
      <li>Although several of my brushes are too thick in the stems to use with this product, several of my other brushes fit just fine.  </li>
      <li>I am somewhat concerned about the edges of the brush guard when putting it on some of the bigger brushes, but I think it will stay in good condition for a long time if you just pinch the end open and be a little careful.</li>
      <li>The brushes keep their form but the brushes do not dry.</li>

<li> I have used these on my makeup brushes for a few years...keeps my brush like new everytime, protects them when in their bag..</li>
<li> They are a little loose on certain brushes, and I am scared that they will end up sliding down the handle and pull the hair back, but for the price and durability you cannot beat them!</li>
<li> They sent me an extra pack due to package lost in the mail.</li>
<li> The reason why I bought these was because I wanted the brushes to dry standing up, but they don&#x27;t dry with the Brush Guard on.</li>
<li> Never knew what a difference having a way to wash and dry your makeup brushes could make.  </li>
<li> I decided to refresh my brush guards and ordered directly from the company on Amazon (in the past I bought them at Ricky&#x27;s).</li>
<li> They run on the small size so they can be hard to get on larger handled brushes and brushes with large, dense hairs (ex. bronzing and powder brushes).</li>
<li> It takes up less room in my makeup bag then the cases they were shipped in and definitely protects them.  </li>
<li> so i put up with second-rate, shendding, rough, no-so-clean brushes.  </li>
<li> They may have dried a little slowly but the shape that they went into was like brand new</li>
<li> A little stiff, but doable.</li>
<li> Not impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed but they at least retain their shape.</li>
<li> I have some very expensive brushes</li>

    <li> I have used these on my makeup brushes for a few years...keeps my brush like new everytime, protects them when in their bag..good to protect your makeup brushes, esp when you spend close to $30 per brush..my bag contains 4 constantly used brushes to protect.</li>
    <li> My girl friends and I love it so much, very good product and same as the picture showed, will order again, thanks.</li>
    <li> These guards are great to keep your makeup brushes clean and tidy.The product arrived in good order and is working well would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I use these all the time and they are great for face brushes. I might invest in the brush tree you can get on amazon for about $20 that is easier to use though but these are great</li>
    <li> Never knew what a difference having a way to wash and dry your makeup brushes could make.  All my brushes look brand new as if they were never used!  I have some very expensive brushes so this is a very inexpensive means to keep my brushes in tip top shape!  Love it!!  Very affordable.  Brush Guard also has excellent customer service so if you have an issue, they will address it ASAP.</li>
    <li> These brush guards are fantastic.  I was close to buying a case to hold my brushes and then saw these.  It takes up less room in my makeup bag then the cases they were shipped in and definitely protects them.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Fits my brushes nicely, keeps dirt and dust off my brushes and keeps their shape after I wash them. I recommend these to any makeup lover!</li>
    <li> These are decent for traveling and maintaining the shape of brushes.

    <li> Bought the Brush Guard--Foundation Pack . excellent case for brushes. Brush holds its shape very well. The hair does not stick out. Similarly, I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with the quality of this product. The plastic is falling apart just after 2 months. Overall, just did not like the set.</li>
    <li> I really like these brush guards. They arrived quickly, and do exactly what they are supposed to do! I ordered 3 different sets because I plan on replacing my current brushes with quality ones over time. The \\&quot;Foundation\\&quot; package comes with 5 brush guards. All 5 brush guards are 5/8\\&quot;, or \\&quot;M\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these on a few of my average-sized powder brushes and I was surprised at how well they fit. The medium foundation brush guards really do fit a wide range of brushes. I am somewhat concerned about the edges of the brush guard when putting it on some of the bigger brushes, but I think it will stay in good condition for a long time if you just pinch the end open and be a little careful. If I had pricey brushes I probably would not trust the guards alone for travel protection. I bought these guards for drying and protecting my brushes after washing them, and they are perfect for that. A must-have for anyone who wants to maintain their brushes!</li>

    <li> Works well.  Make sure to check the sizing guide.</li>
    <li> These guards are the best thing created! When traveling they are a wonderful way to protect you brushes love them</li>
    <li> Perfect for letting my brushes air dry, keeps shape well. Very inexpensive, would totally recommend to friends. Could see my self repurchasing.</li>
    <li> i always loved the idea of proudly owning and applying makeup with professional (expensive) make-up brushes but was confused about their care.  sure i could buy a professional set. but then what?  so i put up with second-rate, shendding, rough, no-so-clean brushes.  i saw Michelle Phan&#x27;s youtube and it changed everything for me.  with Michelle&#x27;s council and Brush Guard&#x27;s protective sleeves, cleaning my brushes is honestly fun and i look forward to it!  thank you Brush Guard for the fine and durable product.  and here&#x27;s the cherry of on this sundae - Brush Guard is an oakland, california company.  Yippeee - I love it !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife to use when we travel. She likes them and says they do exactly what they are designed to do. She is satisfied with them.</li>
    <li> I am very familiar with the brush guard for the past 3 years or so. I decided to refresh my brush guards and ordered directly from the company on Amazon (in the past I bought them at Ricky&#x27;s). Not only did the delivery arrive very quickly and in perfect shape, but I must recommend the professional and kind costumer service. I had a tiny problem with one of the packages sent to me and I contacted the seller. Not only did I get a prompt reply, but I received an completely new package in the mail as well. I need to emphasize that my issue with one of the original packages was really tiny and not that important. So I am very much impressed by the company&#x27;s policy (not to mention the fact that it&#x27;s not an expensive item to begin with, so sending me one new package again might have cost more). Thank You.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I heard about these!! Cleaning my brushes has never been so easy!! They were shipped all the way to Guam, and so quickly!!</li>
    <li> I am so excited with this brush guard because is very practical and efficient. My brushes are perfecly protected and doesn, t deform.</li>
    <li> Really nice, easily cleanable, stay fit and really works! This is now my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for my cleaning process  of my brushes!</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with this product.  Although several of my brushes are too thick in the stems to use with this product, several of my other brushes fit just fine.  It is great to use when storing my brushes, traveling with them, or after cleaning them.  I bought another set of the Brush Guards for my sister!</li>
    <li> A little stiff, but doable. For the price, I guess it will work for now!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really looking for the ones that come with the Lancôme brushes.</li>
    <li> Love my brush guards... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED~ also, the customer service was great. I had ordered my variety pack in november but still did not receive them till December so the customer service replied back promptly and had assured me that they would resent with an additional variety pack at no cost for me. It amazed me how reassuring they are and how promt they are with their customer service. I have used my brush guards for awhile now--with washing my brushes a couple times and they are simply amazing. Brushes are reshaped to their original shape as if it were brand new!</li>
    <li> definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a sturdy way to increase the lifetime of your make up brushes. This is my second time purchasing the brush guard as my brush collection has grown</li>
    <li> The brush guard is a great tool for drying your makeup brushes as well as for protecting your brushes while traveling.</li>
    <li> it did its job and i don&#x27;t even remember buying this but whatever it is what it is/////// ....  ii</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really helpful when transporting the brushes and they dry faster and keep their original shapes. I just wish the Guards shrunk back to their original form. I think they would last longer.</li>
    <li> i found these by accident and what a blessing.  when i wash my brushes (everytime i use them) i place them in these guards and the brushes stay the way i purchased them!  they&#x27;re like new!  i also feel confident when traveling that my brushes won&#x27;t get messed up at all because these guards protect as well as keep them in their original shape!</li>
    <li> You really do need this if you want to extend the life of your brushes and keep them from getting splayed.</li>
    <li> Very effective in keeping my brushes&#x27; shapes. (my contour brush is finally able to do a precise contour instead of a big blob of brown patch! thank goodness!) definitely recommend if you have the same issues of brushes keeping their shapes!</li>
    <li> Work just as good as other brand but a more reasonable price. They sent me an extra pack due to package lost in the mail.</li>
    <li> They may have dried a little slowly but the shape that they went into was like brand new I love it and am planning to repurchase.</li>
    <li> fast shipment and it works my makeup brushes looks new</li>
