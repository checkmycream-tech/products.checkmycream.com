      <li>Nice, does the work I am looking for!</li>
      <li>It has good color, great texture, and the way that the foam is dispensed</li>
      <li>I have been searching forever for a good body lotion to use after I use self-tanner</li>
      <li>This lotion is very nice and creates a nice glimmer and shine on the skin.  </li>
      <li>VERY EASY TO USE AND LOOKS GREAT</li>
      <li>Arrived quick and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is so perfect for a busy mom!!!</li>
      <li>Love love love this moisturizer!</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>For $30 something dollars, one would almost expect this product to be of superior quality and well worth the price.</li>
      <li>and I have not found a better lotion.</li>

      <li>This may be pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>and I am glad I did, so much cheaper.</li>

      <li>Quick application.</li>
      <li>Yet to a large degree, it most certainly is!</li>
      <li>This isnt exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lotion has a brown tint to it, so it may have bronzers in it, but it won&#x27;t turn you orange, just be sure to wash your hands after use to prevent it from possibly discoloring your palms.</li>
      <li>It goes on evenly and absorbs to make me feel fresh and lively.</li>
      <li>I live in a super dry climate and this mousse is really moisturizing and goes on really easy.</li>

      <li>Thanks, Celeste</li>
      <li>It really is a miracle cream.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s meant to be used as an after spray tan lotion to extend your tan, but honestly I use it everyday, even when I don&#x27;t have a spray tan.</li>
      <li>Skin  feels and appears very hydrated with soft color extender.</li>
      <li>It keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated!</li>
      <li>I use it every other day to keep my tan fresh!</li>
      <li>I  have used this before and it works very well, my only problem is that this time it wont come out of the can,and its half full.</li>
      <li>and I finally found this product and can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>

<li> However, it is very heavy and oily, certainly will need a shower before bed if applied earlier.</li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that it makes your skin feel a little sticky/grippy for a few hours.  </li>
<li> Actually, I just got my 3rd can of it the other day!</li>
<li> Use it once a day after showering and your tan lasts 10 times as long!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it!</li>
<li> Takes forever to dry, not minutes but hours.  </li>
<li> I self tan 2-3 times per week and will get dry skin and</li>
<li> Bought a few months ago and and at the time didnt need it so just recently went to use it</li>
<li> Just beware the lotion comes out of the nozzle really fast so push down on the nozzle slowly!</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> it&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
<li> It stays on long and it doesn&#x27;t look fake or orangish.</li>
<li> , it provides a color boost for those who tan, such as myself, and gives a little base for those who do not tan.</li>
<li> unless washed off, and worst of all, the fact that no matter how long you rub it in, it still leaves your skin looking oily &amp; wet.</li>
<li> It applies evenly and doesnt have an awful smell like Jergens natural glow</li>
<li> I ordered the wrong item and still tried to use this</li>
<li> I AM AFRAID OF USING TANNING BEDS</li>
<li> It smells awful.</li>

    <li> Nice, does the work I am looking for!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I live in a super dry climate and this mousse is really moisturizing and goes on really easy. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it nearly every day on my face to give me a nice glow. It goes on evenly and absorbs to make me feel fresh and lively.</li>
    <li> Bought a few months ago and and at the time didnt need it so just recently went to use it and it doesnt spray at all. Realize it was bought awhile back but that has nothing todo with it not working. Have contacted seller and have had no response. I order from amazon all the time. but will not ever be purchasing from this seller again. Do not recommend that you do either. Thanks, Celeste</li>
    <li> I AM AFRAID OF USING TANNING BEDS THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR SUNLESS TANNING VERY EASY TO USE AND LOOKS GREAT HELPS TO COVER UP THE WHITE TAN LINES FOR THAT PERFECT TAN</li>
    <li> Love this product. Skin  feels and appears very hydrated with soft color extender. Arrived quick and in perfect condition. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very nice and creates a nice glimmer and shine on the skin.  However, it is very heavy and oily, certainly will need a shower before bed if applied earlier.</li>
    <li> I have been searching forever for a good body lotion to use after I use self-tanner and I finally found this product and can&#x27;t live without it!  I self tan 2-3 times per week and will get dry skin and the self tan starts to flake off, but not when I use this moisturizer.  It evens out my tan beautifully and my skin is SO soft.  Plus I feel like it really tightens my skin. It really is a miracle cream.  It&#x27;s expensive, but well worth it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. Says its the best</li>
    <li> Takes forever to dry, not minutes but hours.  Rubs off brown on clothing</li>
    <li> I  have used this before and it works very well, my only problem is that this time it wont come out of the can,and its half full.</li>
    <li> This isnt exactly what I ordered. I thought it was a spray. This is my fault for not reading correctly.</li>
    <li> Sprays on very easily/evenly and has a really nice color.  The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that it makes your skin feel a little sticky/grippy for a few hours.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Love love love this moisturizer! I think it&#x27;s meant to be used as an after spray tan lotion to extend your tan, but honestly I use it everyday, even when I don&#x27;t have a spray tan. The smell is amazing and I have not found a better lotion. Just beware the lotion comes out of the nozzle really fast so push down on the nozzle slowly!</li>
    <li> For $30 something dollars, one would almost expect this product to be of superior quality and well worth the price. Yet to a large degree, it most certainly is! Actually, I just got my 3rd can of it the other day! I USE IT DAILY, BUT ONLY AFTER I HAVE SPRAY TANNED AND REGULAR TANNED BEFOREHAND. So, I do not use it as a self-tanner; ONLY use it to extend my spray tan. AND EXTEND IT, IT DOES! Use it once a day after showering and your tan lasts 10 times as long! It has good color, great texture, and the way that the foam is dispensed is a wonderful touch. It stays on long and it doesn&#x27;t look fake or orangish. The only problems that I do have with it are, of course - its price, the fact that it will discolor your clothes (AND HANDS!!) unless washed off, and worst of all, the fact that no matter how long you rub it in, it still leaves your skin looking oily &amp; wet.</li>
    <li> Bought this so I could preserve my tan longer.  Both my wife and I use it,  and with regular us it evens out your tan, and in our opinion seems to prolong your tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion has a brown tint to it, so it may have bronzers in it, but it won&#x27;t turn you orange, just be sure to wash your hands after use to prevent it from possibly discoloring your palms.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!! I love this moisturizer! It keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated! It also smells awesome. I use it to extend my spray tan and it works! My tanning salon is alway sold out of this lotion so I resorted to ordering it off of here and I am glad I did, so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong item and still tried to use this it&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
    <li> It smells awful. If you want to smell like you bathe in tanning lotion and bronzer, be my guest. Just don&#x27;t expect others to want to hang out with you because youll stink.</li>
    <li> This may be pricey, but it&#x27;s worth every penny! I use it every other day to keep my tan fresh!</li>
    <li> This is almost $100 in the tanning salons and my best friends mom swears by it and after using hers once, I was hooked! It applies evenly and doesnt have an awful smell like Jergens natural glow and it doesnt turn your skin colors or anything orange, it provides a color boost for those who tan, such as myself, and gives a little base for those who do not tan. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so perfect for a busy mom!!! Quick application. Put vaseline or something on your hands when u spray so it doesn&#x27;t stain your hands. I love this!</li>
