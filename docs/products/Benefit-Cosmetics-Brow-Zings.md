### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best eyebrow makeup I have used.</li>
      <li>Best Brow product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Out of ALL the products i&#x27;ve used, this one in medium works perfect against my lighter olive complexion/darrrrk hair combo.  </li>
      <li>One of the best Brow fillers there is.</li>
      <li>A perfect medium color that fills out my brows well.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely loved the beneift brow kit !</li>
      <li>I have used this product for about 15 years and was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>But its great i guess for filling in thinned brows, great for space filler but not for lining.</li>
      <li>The wax is great if your having shaping issues.</li>
      <li>This products I can just throw on &amp; it looks great, even &amp; natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE this duo !!</li>
      <li>Saw at Ulta/tried and really loved it.</li>
      <li>Over all its a good compact and good price.</li>
      <li>This is a good eye brow powder, the cream is too creamy for me</li>
      <li>this is a good product</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get a good look with this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This item came fast and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>so I use my own brush</li>
      <li>Thanks benefits for this amazing product !!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regardless of what many have said, I find that this brow kit is amazing for definition as well, not just filling in.</li>
      <li>Love that the wax is colored and sometimes that is all I use and not just the coloring.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s outstanding.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>This creates some awesome definition - but be careful, it&#x27;s easy to overdefine this way.</li>
      <li>Next time I used the wax sparingly and it worked great.</li>
      <li>I was so impressed with how much better they looked that I came back the next day and bought this!</li>
      <li>Although I do have a brow brush, the size of the ones included with the zings is perfect for helping to not overdo it and to make sure you get little, realistic strokes when doing your brows.</li>
      <li>Perfect compact size and long lasting !!</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and can be used with a light hand to give your brows a complete look without looking overdone.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I think my brown eyeliner pencil does a better job than this little contraption, it&#x27;s kinda pricey?</li>
      <li>A medium brown should be medium brown, but it&#x27;s really quite light.</li>
      <li>but other then that it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>but it goes on light, its not dark at all.</li>
      <li>I find it works better to use a thicker flat eye liner brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worked for Benefit Cosmetics and hands down my two favorite products are Browzing and Benetint!</li>
      <li>Tweezers are small but are surprisingly strong and work better than any other pair I currently own.</li>
      <li>First time I tried this I used way, way too much wax.</li>
      <li>I just do what I noticed the girl at Ulta was doing, and gently tap the brush in the gel and</li>
      <li>The wax isn&#x27;t nearly pigmented enough and the powder is too light in color.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This was lighter than expected but it was good since its a great took to shade and fill in the brows but not a great tool for lining and creating solid sharp lines.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale with dark brown eyebrows, the color doesn&#x27;t match 100% but good enough that no one (beside me) would notice.</li>
      <li>This powder is highly pigmented and just overall a very blendable, natural color (I use Dark).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Stays put and looks natural</li>
      <li>If you really want to try it like me, save yourself the hassle and go to your local cosmetic store and purchase it yourself.</li>
      <li>My issue is that the consistency of my medium brown eyebrows from start to finish leave areas looking not as fresh in appearance - leaving my big brown eyes without the structure to POP properly.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re less likely to get large, garish lines, especially on the inside ends of your brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>This is why I find the little brush included with the kit works really well.</li>
      <li>does include cool little tweezers and other brow shaping tools!</li>

<li> I&#x27;m such an eyebrow person and this makes them look so natural and not to dark the only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the brushes</li>
<li> Long story short my eyebrows got butchered</li>
<li> well I actually hated them lol</li>
<li> The only other product that I use on occasion is the Spiked Mac eyebrow pencil...</li>
<li> Also, this company did not deliver on time, I had to hunt my package down and threathen to get my money back before they did anything about tracking my package and redirecting it to me.</li>
<li> /&gt;Until recently, I never really used the wax.  </li>
<li> And given that the gel and powder together stay pretty well, it can be a bit difficult to soften hard lines, especially if you don&#x27;t want to remove your foundation in the process.</li>
<li> definitely buy again, although I do wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
<li> It always looks a little sloppy for me.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s expensive and the shade medium, was too dark for my brows???!!!!</li>

    <li> This was lighter than expected but it was good since its a great took to shade and fill in the brows but not a great tool for lining and creating solid sharp lines. Over all its a good compact and good price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 15 years and was happy to find it on Amazon.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I think my brown eyeliner pencil does a better job than this little contraption, it&#x27;s kinda pricey? And if your like me and use a SPF cream before your concealer and make-up if you try to put this on afterward it won&#x27;t hold or seal on your eyebrows? Also, this company did not deliver on time, I had to hunt my package down and threathen to get my money back before they did anything about tracking my package and redirecting it to me. If you really want to try it like me, save yourself the hassle and go to your local cosmetic store and purchase it yourself.</li>
    <li> Like Benefit&#x27;s Brow Kit!  Wish that the lighter brown shade was creamy, but goes on well. wonder if the Elf Brow kit works as well</li>
    <li> This item came fast and in perfect condition. I always use this because it never looks clumpy, and you can&#x27;t see brush strokes. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> One of the best Brow fillers there is. Stays put and looks natural</li>
    <li> Saw at Ulta/tried and really loved it. So I used Amazon to get it cheaper.  Love that the wax is colored and sometimes that is all I use and not just the coloring.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worked for Benefit Cosmetics and hands down my two favorite products are Browzing and Benetint! Yes, I would recommend these products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless products for my well shaped eyebrows.  My issue is that the consistency of my medium brown eyebrows from start to finish leave areas looking not as fresh in appearance - leaving my big brown eyes without the structure to POP properly.  Out of ALL the products i&#x27;ve used, this one in medium works perfect against my lighter olive complexion/darrrrk hair combo.  The only other product that I use on occasion is the Spiked Mac eyebrow pencil... but that is for days that I go all out or days that I have alot of time on my hands.  This products I can just throw on &amp; it looks great, even &amp; natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not that I do not use the brushes includes.  I find it works better to use a thicker flat eye liner brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until recently, I never really used the wax.  Long story short my eyebrows got butchered and I had to grow them out, leaving some hay wire brows.  The wax is great if your having shaping issues.</li>
    <li> First time I tried this I used way, way too much wax. Next time I used the wax sparingly and it worked great. I&#x27;m pretty pale with dark brown eyebrows, the color doesn&#x27;t match 100% but good enough that no one (beside me) would notice. Tweezers are small but are surprisingly strong and work better than any other pair I currently own.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this duo !! No need for the fancy brow gels or dips !! Perfect compact size and long lasting !! Thanks benefits for this amazing product !!</li>
    <li> This is a good eye brow powder, the cream is too creamy for me but it goes on light, its not dark at all. But its great i guess for filling in thinned brows, great for space filler but not for lining. I use it in the bulb of my brow and use eye pencil to do my tail.</li>
    <li> Best Brow product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> this is a good product but it&#x27;s expensive and the shade medium, was too dark for my brows???!!!! does include cool little tweezers and other brow shaping tools!</li>
    <li> I had a complementary birthday brow bar at Ulta and the girl who did my brows used this. I was so impressed with how much better they looked that I came back the next day and bought this! It&#x27;s outstanding. Although I do have a brow brush, the size of the ones included with the zings is perfect for helping to not overdo it and to make sure you get little, realistic strokes when doing your brows. This powder is highly pigmented and just overall a very blendable, natural color (I use Dark).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of what many have said, I find that this brow kit is amazing for definition as well, not just filling in. I just do what I noticed the girl at Ulta was doing, and gently tap the brush in the gel and then the powder before applying to my brows. This creates some awesome definition - but be careful, it&#x27;s easy to overdefine this way. And given that the gel and powder together stay pretty well, it can be a bit difficult to soften hard lines, especially if you don&#x27;t want to remove your foundation in the process. This is why I find the little brush included with the kit works really well. You&#x27;re less likely to get large, garish lines, especially on the inside ends of your brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again, although I do wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>

    <li> A perfect medium color that fills out my brows well.  It is easy to apply and can be used with a light hand to give your brows a complete look without looking overdone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. I never got the hang of this stuff. The wax isn&#x27;t nearly pigmented enough and the powder is too light in color. A medium brown should be medium brown, but it&#x27;s really quite light. I can&#x27;t get a good look with this stuff. It always looks a little sloppy for me. I switched to Anastasia&#x27;s Dipbrow Pomade and never looked back.</li>
    <li> Best eyebrow makeup I have used.</li>
