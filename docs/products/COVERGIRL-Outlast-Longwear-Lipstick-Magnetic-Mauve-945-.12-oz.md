<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried other type of lipsticks but I have to really admit that this has been such an amazing lipstick. It doesn&#x27;t dry up my lips and the color stays for a longer time before needing a retouch. I loved it! It&#x27;s so smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all. I received this Covergirl lipstick from Influenster to test it out, but all opinions are my own. I&#x27;m so glad I got the opportunity to try this out! I will definitely be buying more of the Covergirl outlast lipsticks because I loved this one! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried a few Cover Girl Outlast products ,but this one really held up very well! The color lasted and even seemed to stain my lips! I love the long wearing results, I could just apply it once and be set all day. But it would be ok to reapply a few hours later just to make them pop more. Most lipstick dry my lips very bad this Cover Girl Outlast did not! Honestly my lips were fine after all day on. I would highly recommend this product and I will buy it for myself.I tested this COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Super easy color to wear and it&#x27;s a great formula!  Very creamy!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free from the Influenster program. I am not a lipstick wearer and I remember why. I would love to be a lipstick wearer! I love the pop of color it gives, but I can&#x27;t get it to last. I don&#x27;t think I would have picked this color for myself, but I actually liked it once I put it on. I always seem to have chapped lips, and although it was said to be moisturizing, it dried out my lips even more. It did moisturize upon initial application, but after awhile I would feel my lips drying out. In addition, it was not long lasting for me. I had to reapply the product several times a day. I really wanted to love this product.</li>
    <li> I received this free from influenster to review. The color was better than I expected, very bright and great for summer. Unfortunately the &amp;#34;outlast&amp;#34; left much to be desired, I had to reapply multiple times throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Got this free from Influenster to test, but these are my own opinions. The color lasted all day. It was smooth and silky! Loved it!!</li>
    <li> I got this for free from influenster.com and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It is highly pigmented and smoothly applies ♡</li>
    <li> I got the shade 940 Vixen Violet from Influenster for testing purposes. It was very pigmented and moisturizing. If you don&#x27;t use lip liner it bleeds easily but it has a light stain that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary for testing purposes and I have to say it amazing. I love how it goes on smooth and has a long wear effect. The color was the right choice for me and very cream color . I will definitely tell everyone to try this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of bright colors and when putting this product on it was a lot brighter than I was expecting. Overall though this product did stay on all day even though I noticed lip marks on my coffee cup from it. I did receive this product free through Influenster, but all these opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really love this lipstick! It feels like butter on my lips, its not sticky glossy feeling that happens with some other lipsticks. It only need re-applied once, and it didn&#x27;t smudge or end up on my teeth!! It also did not dry my lips out. Great drugstore brand lipstick. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Talk about a fun colored pucker pick me upper! This color works great whether you are dressing up or down for the day or night. Unlike some other lipsticks I have tried in the past, this one glides on smoothly, my lips feel soft and not sticky, and the color lasts longer than I would have expected. I received this lipstick complimentary for testing purposes and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I used this lip color after I received it for free from influenster. The formula is actually really nice, and it&#x27;s got a nice scent to it. I was not crazy about the color (mauve) it&#x27;s a little too dark, and a little too pink for my taste.  It might be okay if I was going to an event in the evening.  I would possibly think about trying other shades. Again, I was able to try it for free from influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant at first to try out this color because I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would look good with my skin tone but I absolutely love it. Not only did I only have to apply it once a day but it worked so good to keep my lips moisturized. It has been extremely hot and dry where I live so this was heaven sent. The color stayed on all day which was great for me since most of the time I&#x27;m running around after a toddler so I can&#x27;t reapply as much as I would like. I love how small and compact it is and how it fits perfect in the palm of my hand. I tested this COVERGIRL product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Loving this new lipstick from covergirl-- feels like lip gloss looks like lipstick! Long lasting too!! #glowthedistance *tested COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own*</li>
    <li> I got this free from Influenster to test out, but the thing is, is I don&#x27;t really wear lipstick, but when I tried this on I changed my mind about lipstick, or at least this lipstick, it was easy to put on, it was a nice color and it stayed on all day, even after eating lunch and have two different drink during the day, it still didn&#x27;t come off, so that was great! i don&#x27;t know if I will be buying this color again even though I did like the color, but I will be buying this lipstick again because I really liked it! It also didn&#x27;t have any scent to it like some lipsticks do.</li>
    <li> Everyone is saying that this moisturizes your lips. I didn&#x27;t find that the case for me and I find that odd because the humidity is high right now. I would prefer it to be more buttery, but that might take away from the fact that it can stay longer on the lips. I have to have a back up balm to keep this hydrated on my lips. Maybe I have a faulty lipstick. The color was nice. For any age.&lt;br /&gt;I received my sample for testing purposes complimentary of influenster and cover girl.</li>
    <li> Typically, this is not a color or brand I would pick for myself, but I was very pleased with the results and product overall. I wore this product every day for approximately a week before writing my review. This product goes on very smoothly. It felt like butter on my lips, but not the sickly glossy feeling that happens with some other lipsticks. It only need re-applied twice (after breakfast and after lunch). It didn&#x27;t smudge or end up on my teeth. It also did not dry my lips out. A lot of the drugstore brand lipsticks tend to do that for me. I definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Disclosure: I received these products complimentary for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I did receive this for free for testing purposes through Influenster, however all opinions are my own. I normally HATE lipstick. I hate the way it feels heavy and uncomfortable, the way it comes off when I&#x27;m drinking out of a cup or if I kiss my boyfriend. I had none of those problems with this lipstick. Seriously impressed and HIGHLY recommend this product. It felt light and almost as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any at all and it stayed on all day!</li>
    <li> I am typically a gloss girl not a lipstick girl, but I was given this product to try for free as part of a VoxBox for Influenster.  I would have to say that compared to lipsticks that I have used in the past when wearing it for a night out I felt like my lips stayed much more hydrated.  Also, the color stayed on for a long time before reapplication was needed.  I still have preference to gloss over lipstick for everyday wear, but when I am looking for a more vibrant lip look, I will definitely consider using CoverGirl Outlast Longwear again. Although this product was provided to me for free, all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really love this color and it goes on beautifully, not drying at all like other longwear lipsticks. It did wear off a bit when I ate dinner but I really haven&#x27;t found a lipstick that doesn&#x27;t so I&#x27;m not bothered by that. The color is really nice for my fair skin. It&#x27;s not matte like a lot of longwear lipsticks either which I really like.</li>
    <li> Love the color and the long wear on this lipstick. I&#x27;m not a lipstick wearer but I do wear it for special occasions and when I do I need to feel like I don&#x27;t have anything on. I hate when some lipsticks get cakey or just feel heavy but this does not do that. It&#x27;s very light and very moisturizing. I also love that when I look at the color it is prior to putting it on my lips, I don&#x27;t have to guess what color it&#x27;s actually going to be on my lips. It also goes well with my fair skin which I did not expect. Job well done CoverGirl. I was given this lipstick to test for free. All opinions are my own and honest.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this lipstick. Such a pretty mauve color that is great for summer going into fall. To be expected with longwear lipsticks, it wasn&#x27;t the most comfortable but when I paired it with lip balm it felt great. I did need to apply a couple times throughout the day. I received this CoverGirl product for free but these opinions are all my own.</li>
    <li> My new favorite, go-to lipstick!  This color was perfect for my skin tone and went on smooth.  It didn&#x27;t flake and made my lips feel soft.  The color actually lasted most of the day and I only had to re-apply it once, but really I didn&#x27;t have to.  I just wanted to re-apply it.  It does rub off, so I couldn&#x27;t give my daughter a kiss on the cheek without having to rub it off her face, but other than that this is a great product that I highly recommend.  I can&#x27;t wait to get other colors to try out.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product courtesy of Influenster for my unbiased review and opinion.</li>
    <li> I am hot and cold on this lipstick, applies smooth but has to be re-applied during the day several times. The color is nice and when freshly applied looks great, just wish it would not fade so quickly. Still a good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this COVERGIRL product for free, from Influenster, but all opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I received this product free to review from Influenster and Covergirl, but my opinions are my own!  While the lipstick was damaged a bit in transit, I was able to salvage most of it. I must say that I love the color! Mauves are my favorite, so a color called Magnetic Mauve is right up my alley! While I don&#x27;t find this lipstick particularly long-wearing, I do love the creamy formula. I have this in my normal lipstick rotation now and would consider repurchasing once I finish this tube. If you&#x27;re looking for a great formula and a beautiful color, try this out. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a long-wearing product, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I really liked this Covergirl lipstick!  It did leave my lips somewhat dry, but it definitely is more moisturizing than other lipsticks or lip glosses I have used.  The color was very pretty and true to what it looked like on the sample.  I was nervous to tr usch a bright color, but I LOVED it!  Makes me want to wear color on my lips more often.  I was given this lipstick for free from Influenster in a voxbox, so this is entirely my own opinion.  I would most likely buy this lipstick again unless I come across something else better.  Thanks, Covergirl!</li>
    <li> I received this for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick is surprisingly nice and luxurious. It glides on smoothly and wears well. The Magnetic Mauvesmells quite pleasant. The lipstick also moisturizes my lipstick quite well. The color is rich and flattering for many skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend and plan on purchasing it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this product. The first time I used it i applied it bright and early in the morning around 7am by 1pm it was still in place. The color is super cute and it goes on very easily. This lipstick did not leave my lips feeling dry like most brands I have used in the past. I did receive this for free through Influenster for testing purposes but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I really love this lipstick! It is so smooth and pretty with a little bit of shimmer in it. I feel like the color is a little brighter on than it is in the packaging but gorgeous non the less. It last for a long time even when eating and kissing my husband and daughter. When it does eventually ware off it wares off evenly and it almost leaves a tint or stain on the lips so they aren&#x27;t completely colorless after is wears off. I only reapplied it once in the day. I will buy more colors of this line for sure! I did receive this in my #IDOVOXBOX to try for free but all of these opinions are truly mine.</li>
    <li> I give this product a four star rating...overall it is a beautiful color and applies very nicely. It doesn&#x27;t feel cakey or thick, but a nice light feeling. also provides some great moisture! The packaging is really nice and sleek and definitely doesn&#x27;t look like a drugstore brand of lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t give this five stars is because it has to be applied again 3-4 times in a long day. I wish it would last longer, considering it is supposed to be a longwear lipstick and I hate to be that girl reapplying lipstick at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this for free for testing purposes and for my honest review (which scouts honor is my own opinion).</li>
    <li> I just tried Cover Girl&#x27;s Outlast Longwear Lipstick for the first time thanks to Influentster and my #Idovoxbox.  I am loving the color and feel of this lipstick on my lips!  I have always worn Cover Girl&#x27;s lip stains but this one just might have me making the switch for good. My lips feel amazing and are perfectly moisturized.  As a fair skinned red head, lip color is a must so I don&#x27;t look washed out.  This color is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to complete my everyday look.</li>
    <li> I received this product free for testing purposes through influenster. This review is my personal opinion for the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t know if I would like the color, but it turns out I LOVED it! It is the perfect everyday wear color for me :) The lipstick went on smoothly and the color payoff was great. Pigmented just enough to be able to add color or wear sheer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that this is not a long wearing product for me :( It did transfer quite a bit and I found myself reapplying often. I have yet to find any lipstick (for me) that doesn&#x27;t need some sort of reapplication throughout the day, so it didn&#x27;t bother me that much. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a lipstick to apply in the morning and go all day, I could not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is my new go-to lipstick for daily wear because I liked it that much! I will repurchase this one, for sure!</li>
    <li> I received this lipstick from Influenster and here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a lipstick girl, but I love this one! It feels more like a lipgloss without the &#x27;sticky&#x27; feeling that some leave. Moisturizing like a lip balm with color like a lipstick -- an amazing combo!! I love this color although I would not have picked it out for myself. I will continue to wear it and will look for the other colors as well!!!</li>
    <li> I received my Cover Girl Outlast lipstick, free inside of the &amp;#34;I Do&amp;#34; Vox Box. I was impressed with the smooth finish, and how long the color lasted, on my lips. I am not always a fan of long wearing lipstick,  because of the dry feeling, but this is not the case with this product.  This is my opinion, and I  have received this product, to test for free.</li>
    <li> Great lipstick. I had never been one to use &#x27;drugstore&#x27; cosmetics before, but was sent this product by Covergirl, to try (opinions are still my own). After trying the lipstick I was instantly amazed and can promise you I will be a return buyer. I often worried that these lipsticks that are meant to stay on all day would be too heavy and sticky. That is not the case at all here. The lipstick is a wonderful and natural color that is light on your skin and really does last for a crazy long time. I am a huge fan.</li>
    <li> In testing out this product, I found myself liking it. Its long lasting and stays moisturized without reapply constantly. The shade of the lipstick is a color I don&#x27;t normally wear, but I still liked it. Definitely recommend this product to everyone. I tested COVERGIRL Outlast Longwear Lipstick product for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Im not a real fan of dark colors. I have to say I was actually impressed with the color. Smells good, last long and doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips. I tried this covergirl product for free. My opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of other Covergirl outlast products but was skeptical to try a lipstick.  I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled when I got it because I&#x27;m normally a lip stain type of girl but I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try....boy was I wrong!  I am so impressed with this lipstick!  It stays on way longer than any other lipstick I&#x27;ve ever tried!  I didn&#x27;t like the color at first, even after I put it on I thought it was just a tad too punk for my taste but after wearing it all day and getting compliments on it I&#x27;ve changed my mind...I actually really like it now.  I probably won&#x27;t stick with lipstick for my everyday wear just because the lip stain last longer and stays on while I eat but I will certainly be wearing the lipstick for church and a few other occasions 💋&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free, all opinions are 100% mine.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy with this product. Luckily I was given the chance to try it for free from my Influenster #IDoVoxBox, because it&#x27;s not something I would buy on my own. This is my personal opinion of the product, I was not paid for my review. The shade that I received, Phantom Pink, looked pretty in the stick, but as soon as you put it on it looks like heavy clown makeup or something ridiculously bright that someone in theatre would wear.  Even if the color had been okay, I would have had to add gloss on top because it comes out relatively matte and smeared all over the place. The application itself is terrible as well. It goes on heavy and does not apply evenly at all. It feels sticky, not moisturizing, and I had to rub my lips together a million times to get it to spread easily. This definitely isn&#x27;t something I would wear on my wedding day as the box from Influenster was geared toward.</li>
