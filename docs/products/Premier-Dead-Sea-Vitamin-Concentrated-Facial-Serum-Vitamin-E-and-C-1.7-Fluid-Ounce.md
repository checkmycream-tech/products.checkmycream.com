<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel and has really helped my skin look healthier</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Keeps skin moist and soft.</li>
    <li> the best ever ! wow! try it and you will get it...</li>
    <li> I use this immediately after washing my face or showering and it helps to keep skin from drying out. No tightness after washing. Very pleasant light citrus scent. It is a very light oil. Use a single pump. Ant excess can go on backs of hands to ease dryness.</li>
    <li> I LOVE WHAT THIS HAS DONE FOR THE TEXTURE OF MY FACE. IT IS SOOOO SMOOTH FEELING. AND LOOKS MORE YOUTHFUL. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> This product is very good.  I have been using it only one month, but it has made a dramatic difference in the texture of my skin.  I use it morning and evening and my skin is the most moisturized and soft that it has been in years.</li>
    <li> A nice serum that absorbs fairly quickly, but leaked in the package and lost quite a bit.</li>
    <li> the products are always good but for the last 3 times, one of the bottles is not closed properly and it is a mess in the package. I only lost 1/2 inch of the product, but it is messy. please check to see the bottles are closed.</li>
    <li> Received this serum a few weeks ago and started using morning and evening the same day. My skin felt instantly smoother and hydrated. Saw my beautician today who was the one who had told me that my facial skin was stressed and would benefit from some antioxidants. She commented straight away in the improvement in my skin tone. Will definately buy this again as similar products are up around the $100 mark.</li>
    <li> have  been using this product for two month  and the result is excellen,t face feel and look great, wrinkle around the eye are gone and I  look 10 year  younger</li>
    <li> OK. Very fast delivery</li>
    <li> i have only great things to say about premier&#x27;s dead sea products.  this serum goes on like silk &amp; makes my skin feel unbelievably soft &amp; smooth.  it truly does what you expect it to do:  make your skin look &amp; feel younger &amp; better.  this is not just a quick fix...over time your skin begins to change.  i love this product &amp; will always replenish.  the seller is nothing but professional &amp; gives great customer service...replies to emails, ships quickly, packages securely.  highly recommend this serum &amp; this seller.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT  FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND I LIKE IT ALOT.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!  Sinks into the skin, no greasy residue.  Onlly reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star, was the bottle top came to me leaking a bit and lost some of the fluid.  Amazon made good on it though.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff! We were  in Key West and got pulled into this store trying to hock this stuff to us for $135! Found It here on Amazon for a fraction of the cost. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Its good but not great.</li>
    <li> This facial serium is the best product. I&#x27;ve used expensive products from chanel before and it is nothing compared to this product. The skin absorbs it and there is no greasy feeling to it. It is light and easy to wear under the makeup. And I could see how the appearance of my skin improved. It is not dry anymore. I would buy this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS FRAUD . THE PRODUCTS SUPPOSE TO BE FACIAL SERUM . BUT IT WAS OPPEND AND SHOWER GEL WAS IN THE BUTTLE.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this serum in Israel and had to have more.  My face feels so soft and my make-up goes on over it so smoothly and my pores disappear. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product by far is fantastic plus the shipper stood behind it 100%.  My bottle came with an inch leaked out of it and no questions asked I sent a picture of it to the shipper and they replaced it immediately..  I love the product it leasves your skin very soft and very moisturized I would recommend it to anyone[[ASIN:B00117F5PG Premier Dead Sea Vitamin Concentrated Facial Serum, Vitamin E and C, 1.7-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Just starting using about 2 weeks ago.  Love this product and can tell a huge difference in my skin already.</li>
    <li> Good serum for dry n sensitive skin</li>
    <li> This product is great for my skin.  This was also the best price for this product as it is at least three times the price in the stores.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Its ok, the only thing am not too fond of is that when you first put it on its kind of oily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product has increased so much. The first time I bought it I paid $19.99, the second time I paid $29.99, and now I want to order again but the price increase again. I like the product, but not that much to pay that kind of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this out once and saw immediate results.  I gave a bottle to a friend and she told me she uses this day and evening... I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results with her.  The reason why I gave this 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t know how it will fair in the long term.. but whoa... I&#x27;m gonna purchase more products from this line!</li>
    <li> This is too oily for my liking. It may work for you if you have dry skin, but i find it too oily rather than revitalizing. I could not use it on my face. I will probably use it on my hands and feet so it wont go to waste.</li>
    <li> I am the one who very picky with my choice but this product makes me really happy. (5stars) fast shipping also. just love it</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have extremely sensitive dry skin, and I was concerned the product may cause redness, breakouts or additional dryness.  This product is truly safe for sensitive, dry skin.  I apply it morning and night, and try to put in on first thing out of the shower when my pores are open.  A little goes a long way.  I follow with my moisturizer.  It only takes about 30 seconds to absorb into my skin.  It does not leave an oily residue and make up goes over it nicely.  The only reason I did not give this a higher rating, is like many of the reviews, the lid was not taught and some of the product leaked out.  May be the josling in the shipping that causes the lid to loosen, not sure.  I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, fast absorbing serum and I really think it has helped erase fine lines.  Been using it for about 8 months and will continue to purchase.  It goes on a bit oily - but quickly absorbs into your skin, leaving it very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Using this product: (Premier Dead Sea Vitamin Concentrated Facial Serum, Vitamin E and C, 1.7-Fluid Ounce)has repaired years of damage from the harsh Australian sun. Particularly on the face, neck and decolletage.  I highly recommend this serum as only a tiny amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have used many products through out my years.  This eye serum is the best I have ever used.  I bought it on a whim and am so glad I did. I am 37 and everyone tells me I look like I am 27.  The lines and wrinkles around my eyes have softened drastically.  I would recommend this to anyone.  With such an awesome price, why wouldn&#x27;t you?</li>
    <li> Premiere facial serum feels like oil going on but rapidly absorbs. Skin feels silky smooth-not oily at all.  I use it morning and night and my skin is no longer dry but very soft.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! Put it on under moisturizer! It doesn&#x27;t just stay on the surface of your skin and make it look oily.I can tell a big difference!</li>
    <li> The Serum is helpful to make the skin feel soft. It dos take a bit too much time for absorption however</li>
    <li> The serum is exactly what I wanted. My  esthetician recommended this serum, and I&#x27;m getting great results. I know I&#x27;d be paying so much more for it in a department store.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It smells good and feels wonderful on my face. I have ordered it a few times and never want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this product on my skin.  It is gentle and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  My skin feels smooth and soft after I have applied this product.</li>
    <li> This serum does nothing to help with wrinkles. I is nice moisturizer like any other you can buy at the store</li>
    <li> Love the serum.  Use this nightly and it hydrates my face very well.</li>
    <li> At almost 50, I&#x27;ve tried several serums and moisturizers. Premier Dead Sea products are wonderful and I will continue to use them!</li>
    <li> All Premier Dead Sea products are overpriced fotr the quality. Should be sold as hand lotion for $2.00. Only on a dare I would use the pruduct</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It&#x27;s incredibly smooth, leaves a silky skin and, for me, except for the sunscreen, it&#x27;s not necessary any other product after using it. It seems really oily at first, but after only a few seconds, the skin absorbs it, and it leaves a revitalized and healthy look. Furthermore, it lasts a lot. Just a few drops are necessary to the whole face, and his oily texture allows a delightful massage. It is my second bottle, and I plan to keep using it. Amazing!</li>
    <li> This is an extremely good product that I use every day. I also use the eye serum and eye cream.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing and will be purchasing again!!</li>
    <li> ITS HEAVY AND GREASY BUT ONLY USED A FEW DAYS  NOT SURE ABOUT RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN I OPENED IT THE PRODUCT LEAKED OUT OVER THE INTERIOR OF THE PACKAGE WHICH MAKES ME WONDER IF IT WAS OPENED ALREADY?</li>
    <li> My first experience with this line but won&#x27;t be my last.  LOVE this stuff!  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it&#x27;s making a difference in how my skin looks, but it feels wonderful - my skin, and the serum; like liquid silk.  Wish this came in an industrial size tub; would smear it all over my body.  I&#x27;m big on serums.  Prefer them over lotions on my face.  I&#x27;ve tried several drugstore brands and higher end cosmetic ones.  Think this may be my favorite yet.  Have even used it on my hands to help with dry chapped finger tips.  Wonderful.  When my husband mentioned the skin on his hands was dry and cracking open, I gave him a small drop of this to try.  He later wanted to know what kind of hand lotion I had given him because it worked so well.  I have since ordered the hand lotion and body butter in this same product line.  Can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
    <li> This product is truly amazing, been using it for almost a week now &amp; my face is so soft &amp; wrinkles already starting to fade. I&#x27;m 32 years old but i would recommend this to any age group. I have old scars from acne that are slowly fading too! I got a bottle of the amazing serum for my mother. The first time i used this my husband asked me &amp;#34;what did you do to your face&amp;#34;? He was amazed how soft my face was. Give it a try, i&#x27;ll guarentee you&#x27;ll be coming back for more!</li>
    <li> Soaks in and leaves the skin feeling refreshed and hydrated. Never feels heavy or greasy. I use it day and night.</li>
    <li> Love Premier.  Would order this again and again.  Definitely worth the buy and the price.  Slightly greasy at first, but soaks into skin and lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> This is a dream of a facial serum.  Silky smooth on the skin and smells wonderful. Sinks in beautifully too and a little goes a long way.  Why would I use anything else? It&#x27;s just perfect. I love Premier.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings on this serum, thus far. I love how it feels WHILE applying it. And I love how it feels for the first 20 minutes. I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times now and each time, after about 20 minutes, my face suddenly feels hot and turns red in spots. Like a heat from within, if that makes any sense. Embarrassing, to say the least. For all I know it&#x27;s hot flashes starting, but I&#x27;ve never had one so I&#x27;m not sure what that feels like. And, I don&#x27;t get that any other time but after using this serum. Weird. Anyone else have this issue? I&#x27;ll keep using and see if anything changes and update.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have used other Premier products and this is a great addition to them</li>
    <li> great shipment, everything fine.</li>
    <li> This product is great, first tried a sample of it from the mall kiosk, knew I loved the product, found the best price on Amazon, so happy to find a product I love so much, because of how great your skin feels.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great quality product.  Makes my skin super smooth.  I went through 2 large bottles and plan on getting another! :)</li>
    <li> This facial serum is better than others I have tried.  It smoothes lines and makes the skin soft.  Convenient bottle.</li>
    <li> Simply the best facial serum I have used. I love this product. I was given a sample while browsing shops in Lahaina, Hawaii, and used it during my vacation. It left my skin smooth and not greasy. So I found it on Amazon at a very reasonable price and bought a bottle. I&#x27;m not disappointed. It continues to leave my skin smooth and silky. It goes on smooth and a big oily, but within 10 minutes has dissolved completely into my skin. I can apply sunscreen over it as well. The price is VERY reasonable at around $40 a bottle, given that serums can get pretty pricey. My plan is to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 4 years and love it.</li>
    <li> I have very delicate dry skin. These products have brought new life to my skin. You should try them! This web site has very reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing facial serums through my dermatologist for years and spending a fortune.  I decided to try and find a comparable serum on line.  After searching for hours I found the Premier Dead Sea Facial Serum.  The serum is fantastic, great price and great service.  I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This works really well!  Love how my face feels after using it.</li>
    <li> After using the Premier Dead Sea exfoliating facial gel, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  It is one of the most luxurious serums.  It smells nice, but not overpowering.  The product glides onto your skin and is absorbed without leaving your skin greasy.  I use this after the exfoliating facial gel (also by Premier).  It&#x27;s a daily luxury treat for your skin at an affordable price.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Tried this product &amp; supposed to reduce wrinkles.  Have used for a while &amp; didn&#x27;t work at all.  Waste of time.</li>
    <li> premier products feel awesomely amazing when u first use them, especially since I love dead sea products.  However, something seems to be missing in their products (only used the eye cream and eye serum), which is a long-term moisturize effect. What happens is it feels great and moisturized the moment I put on the serum or cream... but an hour later my eyes are dry again, and a very bad long term affect is my eyes get more dryer and wrinkly with long-time use! terrible! I had to quickly switch back to clinique intensive eyecare to save my poor eye-skin.. thus wasting 2 jars of eye cream and 1 jar of eye serum in my overly enthusiastic zeal when purchasing this item.   Also, for those of you that have used dead sea products before (ie: ahava, aya), there is a very distinct smell of that israeli mud... which we cannot smell in the premier products.</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews for the Premier products and was so excited to try them! I purchased the facial serum, eye serum and the eye cream. Upon first use, my eyes and face were very dry. With continued use within a week of day and night application, the skin around my eyes was dry and flaky. My fine lines stood out more than I had ever seen! I am very disapointed in the product.   The seller was amazing, however. Durring the week before Christmas I ordered them expecting not to recieve them util January. I was pleasantly surprised to find them on my door step 2 days before Christmas! The seller gets 5 stars, but the product I can only give one.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  Over a period of about three months, it has smoothed out a lot of wrinkled areas and prevented new wrinkles from cropping up.  It was by chance that a  sales rep at the mall gave me a couple samples from the Premier Dead Sea kiosk.  I always love free things, so I gave it a try.  It felt so wonderful, and  have now been using it ever since that time.  I recently went to a party with 10 of my friends who are either around my age or younger, and my complexion looks vastly smoother and younger than theirs.  After washing my face at night ( frequently exfoliate to open pores and remove dead cells) I apply a small amount over all areas of my skin except my nose.  It feels so smooth afterwards and the absorption is lovely .  It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t sit on top of the skin like other oils.  I have used products that will leave residue on the skin which actually seems to exacerbate the wrinkles.  Not so with this serum.  Because I live in a very dry area and spend time in the sun, I use the serum in the morning as well.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier, and it took a lot of errors buying other products to find this one.  The benefits of this truly outweigh its cost;  I highly recommend it and wish I had started using it sooner.  The product is about four times more expensive at the mall, so this is a great value.</li>
    <li> excelent. use it under premier age cream. skin looks rejuvenated.</li>
    <li> Great product but Bottle wasn&#x27;t closed properly, serum leaked in the box, therefore, I lost some of the product. Please be careful with the packaging next time.</li>
    <li> Tingles a bit but provides good moisture and revitalization for skin. Pump is a little hard to control, but overall good product</li>
    <li> Nice. I would buy this again and again and again its that good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 5o&#x27;s and have oily skin. Nothing seemed to work, until I started using this product.  I noticed the difference almost immediately. My face feels great after applying.  I would highly recommend this to product.  It works.</li>
    <li> The product leaked into the packaging and was half spilled out upon arrival. The product itself is a good product.</li>
    <li> I have used Arbonne serum before and liked it very much. However, the Premier Dead Sea Serum is far superior. Goes on silky smooth and dries quickly. Results are fantastic!</li>
    <li> Since I am over age 70 and am an ultra runner my skin takes a beating. I really like this product. It keeps my skin hydrated and soft. People think I am in my late 50&#x27;s or early 60&#x27;s. It is worth the price.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in the mail a few months ago.  It felt so nice and made my skin very soft.  So I ordered a bottle from Amazon.  This is amazing stuff.  I had a scar under my eye and it&#x27;s almost gone now!  I use it every night now.  I love this product and will buy more.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the facial serum, and I believe it does help soften all my wrinkles.  I love how it feels on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Not only is Vitamin C and E great for your skin, but this one feels so good going on and soaks right in!  My skin feels and looks better since I started using it a few weeks ago.  I will be a repeat buyer, great stuff!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working! Love the way it feels.</li>
    <li> Fast absorbency, nice smell. Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a change in my complexion and over all skin texture.  Very nourishing to the skin. Love it so far.  The seller is very generous.  Some of the product spilled when I received it; and they answered by complaint promptly and sent me a lot of samples to make up for amount lost.</li>
    <li> I read the data about using a dermaroller to help with skin care. Also known as \\&quot;microneedle skin care.\\&quot; The dermaroller company suggest an intense serum with Vitamin E and C to be used after microneedling. The needle system allows more product to absorbed into the skin, therefore you will see better results. They also say not to use anything that is not in a pump as it will become unstabalized. This fit the bill. While using the derma roller I use EMU oil to keep infection down, and then wash my face with antibacterial soap. You only have about 10 min to get the concentrated facial serum on your face before your face pores begin to close up. So after I wash with antibacterial soap, I run the derma roller over my face again, and put on the serum. The lines around my eyes have literally disappeared. The lines around the top of my lips are diminished by 50% and the deep lines are now barely noticable. I am a 54, white female, with oily skin on my forhead and dry skin on my cheeks and eyes. I am going to order another bottle.</li>
    <li> This serum feels good when you put it on.I would say it helps keep your skin moist&lt;br /&gt;and gives some sort of protection, but there is no miracle serum out there no matter&lt;br /&gt;what the price.  Just using moisturizing products helps refresh your skin. I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product, although it is oily when you first put it on, but after about 5 minutes it absorbs&lt;br /&gt;and there is no oily residue on your skin.</li>
    <li> Love the immediate results</li>
    <li> To be honest this is my very first facial serum. I use it now for two month and I have to say it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it twice a day or on very hot days just once (at night).&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a little bit irritated because it feels kinda oily when you apply it. But after half a minute or so it is already absorbed by the skin and it leaves a good feeling. Afterwards I put the day or night cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just need a little bit of the serum (just one pump per use) so I guess it will last about 4 or 5 month (measured by the amount that i used in the last two month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am always divided between Premier and Gratiae I will use Gratiaes facial serum next. If I don&#x27;t forget I will update this review (if it is possible) to compare the two serums with each other.</li>
    <li> Love this product.... Best ever, i takes years off your face</li>
    <li> love the product, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 4 years. When I first started, people would ask me what I had done to my eyes. Formerly, they would tell  me I looked tired!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a facial serum  on Amazon based on reviews and stumbled on this.  It had GREAT past reviews already but I didn&#x27;t want to jump yet on buying the full size bottle just in case I am allergic so I got a sample first...AMAZING RESULTS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not hesitate for one bit buying this bottle on Amazon and such a GREAT price too!!!  I have been using this under my daily moisturizer and I have felt and seen results.  My skin is smoother, more radiant, and most importantly...moisturized especially now in the winter dry season.  Half a pump is all I need for my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> This works great in the summer when I have had a little too much sun. My husband even lets me put it on his face when he gets a slight sun burn.</li>
    <li> I received the package and when I open the box the product was slightly leaked out in the packaging. Unsure if it was due to the fraud design/packaging. Not too happy about it.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this you don&#x27;t know what your missing.  First saw it in Vegas but way too expensive.  Bought it on amazon and love the price.  If you have dry skin, an absolute must try.</li>
    <li> I like the silky feel of  the serem</li>
    <li> I have never seen results so quickly than when using this product.  People tell me how nice my skin looks when I use it!</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product, that I found at the Grand strand mall in Myrtle Beach .They were selling it for 200 a bottle, my sister managed to get them to 100.00.I got a sample pack, and found it here sooo cheap. Skin feels so wonderful and smooth.</li>
    <li> Product receives 5 stars..... but..... always leaks out in box before receiving the package, too expensive to arrive half full.... Unhappy!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so wonderful on your skin. Goes on oily then your skin just sucks it up. Feels silky.</li>
    <li> I really love this and love theprice compared to what they sell it for in the malls.  Am very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Works great would highly recommend this to anyone how wants a firmer looking complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I’m 53 and its really helped overall.</li>
    <li> This made my face dry in spots exacerbating peeling so I stopped using it.  As much as I like vitamin C and E products for the face, I think this may have been too strong for my skin.  With daily use my face developed little patches of dry skin that flaked.  As soon as I stopped using it, the flaky skin disappeared and returned to normal. Another Premier Dead Sea product which I am not impresses with.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it! Makes my skin so soft and smooth. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I am using the serum for 2 years now and I still in love with it.   My skin is extremely sensitive and I am very picky with my choice.  This product makes my skin smooth, silky and visibly better.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel so silky and smooth!  It wears well under my foundation.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent facial serum.  a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Got this bottle with some of the serum leaked out into the box. The outside box was fine , packing fine. When brought to the attention of the company they wanted pictures of how much was left in  the bottle and made excuses for the way the lid fit. They admitted the lid did not fit well but did not want me to return the product. Now if I was dishonest could I not have poured half out into the box and taken the picture. Good heavens. Will not be buying from them again. Sadly I liked the product ok but won&#x27;t do business with Premier after this.Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> As soon as you wash your face and apply the serum to your face, the application is so smooth and silky.  It does not dry out your skin at all.  I&#x27;ve used several different kinds of serums, by far this is the best one!</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes of slowing down the process of the inevitable. I am 42 years old and have been a sun worshipper for most of my life. As a result, I have very dry and somewhat wrinkled skin on my face. After using this product for a month I have seen a dramatic difference in the quality of my skin. It is no longer dry and even seems to be more youthful. I wasnt sure I was going to like it because of the &amp;#34;greasy like&amp;#34; feel but that only lasts a few minutes and then it is absorbed, leaving you feeling very soft. I would highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and arrived exactly when I expected it.</li>
    <li> It is excellent cream, feels good on my skin. My face skin feel better ever ince I start using this product</li>
    <li> Texture feels like it has silicone or glyercin in it...very slippery.  Sold mine on ebay.  If you like it, buy it from Amazon...don&#x27;t get ripped off by the cons at the mall!</li>
    <li> i like the smell goes on greasy but vanished quickly. Not sure that I would ever buy agin because I havent seen any changes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and I have people asking me what I&#x27;m doing differently.  YAY!  It leaves my skin feeling smoother.</li>
    <li> Premier Dead Sea Vitamin Concentrated Facial Serum with Vitamin E and C is great for your skin.  While you shouldn&#x27;t replace your regular moisturizer with this product, start feeding your skin by using this serum under your moisturizer.  It has all the good stuff in it.  It goes on smooth as silk and is absorbed quickly into the face and neck.  It doesn&#x27;t burn, sting or smell.  If you&#x27;re fighting aging, and who isn&#x27;t, this product is a great weapon to add to your skin preservation arsonal.</li>
    <li> I love the Premier product line. The silky smooth feel is incredible. I have been using the eye serum for over a year and loved it, so I wanted to try this for the whole face. It is just as great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while. I find in the very dry environment of AZ that it is great for my mature skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum as it is absorbed so easily and makes my face feel smooth right away. I always use it before my regular moisturizer &amp; I feel like it seals in the misture.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! It makes my face feel so smooth and soft! It is fantastic and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product with great fragrance.  Soaks right in to your dry skin. Feels luxurious.  Extra bonus with vitamin E and C.</li>
    <li> It is supposed to tighten but I didn&#x27;t get that result.  It does feel a bit oily after applying.  Didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used.  I live in a desert and my skin feels better than my teenagers, without all of the oiliness.</li>
    <li> Good product but price has steadily increased.</li>
    <li> Love this serum.  Feels good on your face.  Been using these products for over 2 years.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Just heavy enough that you feel it is really working.  I think my skin looks younger all the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  feels good on the skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews claiming this is not the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;. It may not be considering the substantial price mark down from what is costs on the website. Nonetheless, it seemed to do what it was intended to and smelled nice without the oily residue you get with some Vitamin E based creams.</li>
    <li> Product was silky on the skin..Not too heavy. Very absorbent into the skin. Gave me a fresh, glowy complexion. Great price compared to Chanel, Estee Lauder and Dior with the same benefits.</li>
    <li> Great product; great service!</li>
    <li> At 58, I have graduated from many of the product lines of my younger decades. This serum absorbs well and I follow with a face cream from this line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and find that it makes a great ending to my daily shaving routine.  Top notch packaging and delivery times to boot make this a great deal.</li>
