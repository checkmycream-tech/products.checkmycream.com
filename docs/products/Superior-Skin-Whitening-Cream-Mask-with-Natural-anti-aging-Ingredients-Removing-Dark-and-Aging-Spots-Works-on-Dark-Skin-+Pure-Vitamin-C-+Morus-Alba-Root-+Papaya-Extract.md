<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried it because it said whitening mask as I like to keep my skin baby white. I have noticed a slight ivory skin change on me and also noticed that I have less blackheads on my nose. I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why all the bad reviews for this product I received it yesterday and I noticed the difference he immediately first time use I think it is because when I researched for the best skin lightener for asking for African American skin this was at the top of the line I think it may be more inclined toward darker skin tones that&#x27;s why people with the lighter skin tones and olive skin are not seeing the results that they want to see so far so good I also accompany the mask with the lightning serum  and maybe that&#x27;s also the problem you may need to prepare both together in order to see results I purchase and use them together and saw a radiant glow to my skin not only that the dark pigmentation from shaving on my face seem to be a lot lighter after one use so give it a chance and maybe like I said it&#x27;s just guided and the ingredients are for a darker skin pigmentation</li>
    <li> I can not say it´s working after 2 weeks of using this product</li>
    <li> My skin is so evenly toned now. Never had a skin cream that actually worked before.</li>
    <li> As soon as I take it off my skin feels super soft! No issues yet with this product and will most likely buy it again. As far as skin brightening it may be too early to tell the difference.</li>
    <li> so just started using this and hope it works like it says, keeping my figures crossed fast service thank you</li>
    <li> Its working... I hope u will keep the quality</li>
    <li> My skin often feels dry after using, and I have not seen any obvious effect. Hopefully it will work soon.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this face mask. I have been using it about twice a week for about 3 weeks. The orange smell is wonderful and so refreshing. It gets pretty hard and tight in about 10 min. That&#x27;s my favorite feeling about a mask. It let&#x27;s me know its doing the job. Its a nice white color to. I have not had any issues with it on my towels. I have used some products that discolor my towels. In in the couple weeks a spot I have had for years is getting notcibaly lighter!!!! That makes me so happy</li>
    <li> I love thing mud. leaves my face feeling fresh and clean every time. i use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> this actually made my face break out, and i didnt see any changes at all</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t bring instant change to your skin but it does leave skin soft. About three or four times of use I start to notice the difference : )</li>
    <li> This product is so good. I love how it makes me feel. It came well packaged and works just as described. Time to buy some more. :) Thanks for the great product</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really use it often, a little uncomfortable when it dry on your face. but pretty good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for lightening under arms, knee caps, elbows, acne scars...saw results right away...this is a REAL review lol. No lies. I&#x27;m a caramel colored girl...olive to tan skin, and this worked well for me personally.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good. I have used just a couple times and fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;It is something I would recommend. I am going to order anther one for my sister to try.</li>
    <li> I have used it few times and I do feel my skin is lighter now. I hope the effect stays.</li>
    <li> So far so good&lt;br /&gt;I admit I should be using it more often..but because it can be a bit drying I am using it only&lt;br /&gt;Twice a week...I do believe my dark spots are lightening...I noticed this morning because it was a foundation free day...I especially noticed it near my eye...two spots I usually camoflage were appreciably lighter...will keep using</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00H5BDX7Y Whitening Cream Mask to Whiten Your Skin for Even, Clear Skin Tone Removing Even Darker Blemishes - Best Whitening Cream With Natural Researched Skin Lightening Actives.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know this may be work on another types of skin, although the instruction doesn&#x27;t inform any hint about that. This product seems for all types among people and all areas within body as well; apply it on face, arm, knee, and etc. If this used to even and cure skin with scar, acne, mole, pimple, eczema, or other skin problems! No specification and limitation details.&lt;br /&gt;What I did, I just followed \\&quot;undetailed\\&quot; instruction; applied it for 15 mins, then repeated it folded times a day (on a tiny scar partial area in my hand);that is it. What I have to do before and after to avoid void?. Before purchase, I had researched into such reviews and saw the stellar rate. It were nice-in-good, and title review as well, so all set. After purchase, followed instruction. What I can do else for caveat. May be more research, use the cream after applying condensed steamer in order to open the pores and let the mask penetrates and works well, but no given instruction tells that, so it is not my fault! Thus I just have returned it, because no result for even skin or even noticeable dot elimination.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need this be recurred. Returning product process doesn&#x27;t satisfy both, and this is responsibility of producer and  customers to elaborated their testimony and others as possible clearly.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helpful besides other peer-social reviews to search over for product research interest into short term and for future enhancement and progression.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Works after first use. My dark spots appeared lighter and skin brighter! However, it does leave your skin a bit dry so use plenty of cream following use.</li>
    <li> the cream really works, so far I have seen darker spots on my face to start fading since day one. My only concern is if they will go back if I stop using the cream, I will find out when the product is gone :). I recommend it it is  an A+. Also you will see your face radiant and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband&#x27;s dark spots. Works great on his pigmented skin and seems to be fading well. Took about 2-3 weeks before we were able to see a difference but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to treat sun damage I&#x27;ve had for years on my face, after a month and half of 3-4 times a week of use there is no result.  I use sunscreen whenever I go out in the daytime and use lotion on my face after every use, still no effect.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again after I finish using the container.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. I have used a couple of times. It is good for inhibiting acres.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it once a week in conjunction with their Symwhite serum.  It makes my skin very soft and is helping to lighten dark spots. I can&#x27;t say enough about their products. It has such a clean feel unlike other products that seem to leave a dry stripped feeling to the skin. And the price is great and worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I have been using the mask for a week and a half and I already see a difference in my skin tone.  A good difference! I am African-American with a light complexion and my acne spots have lightened considerably. I will reorder.</li>
    <li> I use the mask its really good ... It softened my skin n my face looks fresh ...but i hv used 3 or 4 times so no whitening yet but may be later on...</li>
    <li> I have used the product for 3 weeks，I see some results. I was surprised by this product. I love it.</li>
    <li> Wow, this product is actually helping to fade my melasma. It hasnt made it disappear, but I can definitely see an improvement after about three weeks use. I like the fact there is no hydroquinone in this product. I will be ordering it again!</li>
    <li> It did not remove dark spots, however it did remove thick skin from acne marks, resulting in super smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used it all over body, very pleased with results.I need 2 more jars. I used it once every week. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I was having an issue with discoloration of my face due to some medication,  but for the first two weeks of applying this whitening mask I&#x27;ve seen some improvement in my skin specially on my acne scars.  I will higly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much results from applying the mask daily. I&#x27;ve used this product for almost a month now. However, I&#x27;m still unaware if my skin is oily or combination. I expect to see much better results within another month.</li>
    <li> Worked great, awesome product</li>
    <li> My skin does appear brighter after using the mask, it also feels super soft and really firmed up. I haven&#x27;t had any issue with breakouts with the mask, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a lighten effect on my dark spots yet but it makes my skin sooooooo soft. I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s finished to see what happens.  ☺</li>
    <li> Worked immediately with noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I have used it several limes and I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been just over a week since I&#x27;ve started using this mask, and I absolutely see improvements in my complexion as well as my skin spots have completely lightened. I&#x27;m excited to see even more results as I continue to use it! I&#x27;ve tried a few lightening products now and this is by far the best one.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream with marvellous quick results</li>
    <li> I have only used this item a few times so far, hope to see some changes. I obtained it with a promotional price , so will report back later on findings.</li>
    <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two weeks, and I&#x27;ve seen a very slight change. I was expecting more for when I read reviews for this cream before purchasing it, I was reassured the effects would be great. So far I&#x27;m not convinced of it.</li>
    <li> very nice. Great product. My face was shining like a star even just one use. I recommend it for all.</li>
    <li> Just used for the first time. I actually saw a overall brightness to my African American skin.  I have acne spot I am trying to clear up.  I will used this everyday for two weeks as my skin is oily and I should not have a probably with drying out.  I will update this after the two weeks.  wish me luck!!</li>
    <li> fake reviews , don&#x27;t believe , IT DID NOTHING, it has damaged my skin</li>
    <li> 0-star. It burned my face so bad, I ended up in the ER. Don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
    <li> I like Swiss because most of products are natural and customer service is good. I am planning to buy another product of Swiss.</li>
    <li> great product,however ive not been consistent with usage of it ,so my acne scars are still visible on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Will update later on the progress made with acne scars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three days. I am so pleased with the results..as an added benefit I also use the whitening cream. I am seeing my Sun spots lightening and a clearer complexion..😁</li>
    <li> It has been making my skin color lighter and it has softened my skin. I am happy using this mask. I use it about 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive skin. I love this mask</li>
    <li> After a month of continual use, I expected to see some results...not the case.</li>
    <li> after the first use I realized that I has a hypersensitivity to the product, it caused a very irritating rash on my face, I stopped using the product for 2 weeks and tried again and again I developed the rash on face. the product does not advise how often to use the product. I have discontinued use</li>
    <li> I barely write a review for a product but this one is exceptional. The first time I used it, I already can feel the difference. I will continue to use this product and will write another review once I see and experience my target result.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work. Didn&#x27;t see any changes in skin tone. Waste of time and money. Buy yourself something else.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen my skin lightening up, but it doesn&#x27;t break me out. Which is great, bec I have a sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> No noticable difference whatsoever. Will not be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to help with some scars I have from acne, surgeries, as well as lighten my horrid stretch marks(as  call them war scars).&lt;br /&gt;  Its been a few weeks, and so far i&#x27;ve had success!! I use it 3 times a week, about 15 minutes before i shower i apply on upper legs(stretch marks), on the scars on my face, and on a scar from a surgery on my neck. I am seeing a diffrence. It did take a few applications to see results, which is expected!!&lt;br /&gt;  I dont use very much, i use a cottonswab for the face blemishes(easy to put on selected surfaces) and for neck scar, and use two fingers to put on stretch marks. Its a very thin layer that I apply, a little truly goes a long way!! I have already had results, which ive never had with numerous products I have used over the years. Im very excited to watch my battle scars fade!! I truly have hope that I will swim without shorts someday again, and not have to wear concealer daily!!&lt;br /&gt;* I recieved this product at a diacount for my HONEST review.</li>
    <li> AAA+ leaves my skin even and glowing!  Only on my 3rd use. Gets ride of pimples too. I would recommend this to all.</li>
    <li> I am African American (Age 48) and was looking for something to help fade acne scars.  I believe nothing works as well as Hydroquinone but you need a Dr&#x27;s prescription to get a high enough dose of Hydroquinone- and even then it&#x27;s very expensive- $90 last check.  The Swiss Botany product works.  It&#x27;s not fast, but if you use it consistently it will show results.  I saw an overall &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; of my skin after about 2 weeks.  Now, fading of the acne scars is taking longer - about 6-8 weeks- but it is working. Definitely not an overnight fix but if used consistently it will do the job.</li>
    <li> When I got this product I wasn&#x27;t for sure how good this one works.  It works good.  I don&#x27;t use them everyday but I use a few times a week to keep my skin for even color.  So far I think it works great.  Even on my sensitive skin it doesn&#x27;t break out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product somewhat skeptical about how effective it would be. I have tried other more known brands&#x27; products for reducing spots.  This really is working.  Not only do I notice that my spots are lighter, my overall skin tone has improved. I am pretty excited about this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m light skin with some dark spots on my face but this product did nothing at all.. Just wasted my time and money</li>
    <li> Got this product for my wife, she has a sensitive skin . Based on the brand and reviews we decided to order this product. It’s almost two weeks for now she is using it, there is no drastic change , but can see better and even skin tone. That’s really nice so we can assure that it doesn’t have harsh chemicals. Very much satisfied with the quantity and quality of the brand . Hope to review the items again after complete use of one bottle. Definitely will suggest others to buy and will order again. The delivery was pretty fast as well.</li>
    <li> Very good product.. Leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Perfect and loved it ! smells great and actually does what it says!</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell. Works very fast! Saw a difference in dark spots almost immediately.</li>
    <li> i started to see results after 5 applications. it is easy to wash off.</li>
    <li> After a week I already see results! Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Very Over drying to my skin!</li>
    <li> The tub is tiny. Havent tried it yet, but i&#x27;ll review when i have</li>
    <li> I have only used this for two weeks but I am very pleased with the results. I apply it to my face &amp; chest areas at night and shower it off in the morning. All areas have improved, the spot applications on my face have improved the quickest. I still need a few more weeks to say everything has cleared up, but the sun spots are definitely much lighter!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have been using it for about 3 months and it has definitely helped with dark spots left from acne and general skin tone unevenness.The results are more enhanced when used with their skin brightening serum.</li>
    <li> I am a strong believer in taking the best care of myself, so ever so often I&#x27;ll try something new, so after reading the description I decided to give swiss botany whitening maskva try and am glad I did, it leaves my skin feeling smoothe and looking clear. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product really works. I bought it to help lighten my freckles(I have lots) and even my skin tone. I have been using this product now for two months which goes to show a little goes along ways. Also want to note I have very very sensitive skin to many makeup and beauty products but not this one it leaves my skin so soft and bright but not that shiny type of bright. Once again very pleased and plan on purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This cream does not work. Do not waste your money and time.</li>
    <li> No results in appearance.  But on a good note... no irritation to my skin as well.  Just hate I lost my MONEY!</li>
    <li> Good product and quick delivery. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I use this whitening cream for 2 full months and did not experience any whitening effect at all. It did however dry  a break out so it has some purpose. I followed the directions exactly! The company contacted me a few weeks later, asking for a review. They said it if I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product, they will more than happy to provide a refund. You can try it, but I would not expect dramatic results. I used it on my face and on the top of my hands, there wasn&#x27;t any change at all. I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> works slow, but works.</li>
    <li> This actually works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now, every other day &amp; I have noticed a great change in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I had some minor discoloration on my skin &amp; uneven skin tone with a few dark spots on my face as well. After using the product for about three times I noticed my dark spots to be almost completely faded. Now I&#x27;m still using the product &amp; continue to see my skin tone improving. I am very glad with this product so far &amp; it even helped out with some little zits I get every now &amp; then. Really happy, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks. I have seen a slight improvement in my skin so far and am hoping to see more as I keep on using it.</li>
    <li> Wow this cream it&#x27;s very great,  at first I was using only once a week, cause I was scared of the results, but nothing happened to my face so I&#x27;m using twice a week now and all my friends are noticing that my face is getting brighter and cleaner</li>
    <li> i bought it as gift for my mother she says its really good to use and very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Great product work wonder</li>
    <li> I loved the product. Started seeing result in 2 weeks</li>
    <li> Only used it a couple of times so far but it makes my skin look good and glowing! And after finishing the jar, I am ready to order another one: it really helps the texture and the color of my skin and I simply love it!</li>
    <li> Great result in a short time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several products to decrease my hyper pigmentation in the face&lt;br /&gt;and even the skin tone.  Did not have much success.  Then my son ordered&lt;br /&gt;this product for me.  Voila!  In about 2-3 weeks there was a marked&lt;br /&gt;improvement in my complexion.  My husband even commented on it.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Swiss Botany!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nalini</li>
    <li> Great product. Super fast shipping. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now, and I must say so far, so good. I bought the mask to remove dark spots and help even my skin tone. The dark spots are fading slowly, but they are really dark. My overall skin tone showed improvement after the first week. I&#x27;ve spent twice the amount on name brand products by famous doctors and didn&#x27;t get these results! My goal is to only wear foundation on special occasions, so I&#x27;m going to stick with this.</li>
    <li> Very nice product! No irritation, works well!</li>
    <li> it complements the symwhite whitening cream very much.  my face is clear, radiant and no blemish now.&lt;br /&gt;the only problems i have with the whitening cream mask is that there is no frequency of use in the directions.&lt;br /&gt;is it to be applied daily? i use it three times weekly. i love it.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It helps a lot in lightening dark spots due to sun damage. I have had redness around my nose and on both cheeks, plus some dark spots, both inconsistencies are now gone and my complexion has evened out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream about 5 or 6 times, I was a little skeptical at first but so far I&#x27;m getting very good results. This cream has taken away quite a bit of redness from my face, making my skin tone look more even. The only downside is that my face feels a little tight when I put the cream on, I don&#x27; t really like the feeling but for the results I&#x27;m getting, I&#x27;m willing to put up with it. I&#x27;m insulin resistant and get these dark patches (Acanthosis nigricans) behind my neck, I want to try that area next and hopefully it will lighten it up, I will update this review with the results.</li>
    <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is not that hard so it&#x27;s not difficult to cover the face.</li>
    <li> It works ok, the consistency needs to be better.</li>
    <li> Great Value!&lt;br /&gt;very good!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference after using it religiously for a month.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this now for two weeks and I definitely see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied a thin layer over my entire face, every morning before my shower (if you are putting on any acne medication or sunscreen with this make sure it is COMPLETELY washed off your face first or it will combine with it and peel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this to even out your skin tone, get rid of acne blemishes, bags under your eyes, dark spots then this is your stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I had a misunderstanding, I thought this would lighten my entire face, including some scars I have due to an injury, but it didn&#x27;t. So now I&#x27;m gonna try something specifically for that. But anyway, I think this does do what it claims.</li>
    <li> I just started using this and use it every 2 days. I am olive skin toned and have some hyperpigmentation around my mouth which I am hoping this can help with. I like that it does not irritate my acne prone skin. In fact it has helped heal some minor zits heal faster! I will update after using for a few weeks!</li>
    <li> This works. I have a ton of acne scars. I recommend exfoliating first. I wish I knew when I first got it. When I first started using it I didn&#x27;t a difference so I just exfoliater one day to see if it would make a difference and let me tell you something. It works</li>
    <li> great. It is worked described</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for some time and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with my acne scarring. My overall skin condition has improved, though.</li>
    <li> I have great results, but from my routine, not so much from the mask. I think it&#x27;s a little bit too pricy, because it doesn&#x27;t really help alone, so I&#x27;m looking for a cheaper option to include in my routine.</li>
    <li> This was my first face mask product and it did not work for me. It is expensive for a product that ended up only cleaning my face and not its main claim which is to whiten skin. My acne scars and skin tone did not change noticeably even after using the entire container. In general, my skin felt softer and cleaner after usage, but the results were comparable to regular face washes.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all when trying to get money back it was to late</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all. I was really hopeful since I have many dark spots/blemishes. I followed directions and was carful to stay out of the sun as much as possible. Still no change. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. It will make your face peel lightly for about a week. Nothing a little exfoliating wouldn&#x27;t take care of.</li>
    <li> Over a month of use and I haven&#x27;t noticed any helpful benefits other then it clogs my pores and causes breakouts.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> This has enhanced my skin, so soft, light and fade out my spot... I use it most times at night and i feel fresh after washing it off.. My husband has also joined in d game..great experience</li>
    <li> i write you before that Swiss Botany not work for me it was waste money like throwing my money in the garbage. This is some i learn not to buy the first trash i Saw .</li>
    <li> Great used this for my horrible farm tan and it works. It brightend my skin tone by a few shades</li>
    <li> I love the product my dack sports is gone , my skin is flowllees , I deffently  order again. Thanks a lot for the great cream mask.</li>
    <li> Love this! Great for skin whitening.  Used on a few spots on my face to achieve a more even skin tone.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It&#x27;s because I have uneven facial skin tone and I&#x27;ve been using this twice a week for a month. And it really improved my skin tone. I use it with other Vitamin C gel under the mask and it really works great. I was sad when they were out of stock but now it&#x27;s back so I am going to get two this time. This brand&#x27;s products are all excellent and I definitely recommend them!</li>
    <li> It is indeed a nice product.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t whiten fast at all. Ive been using for 2 months and really haven&#x27;t seen a difference but I guess it takes time</li>
    <li> I use it twice a week in the evening after washing my face. After a month, i noticed my skin looks brighter and clearer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since last couple of weeks even more, it didn&#x27;t really work for me. The acne scars and dark spots are still there I used it after every 2-3 days. I don&#x27;t know how to make it work or how to get my money back :((.</li>
    <li> love , love, love this product!! wish i would have gotten it a long time ago! i have only been using it for a couple weeks but i notice a difference already..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much for the quick and easy transaction!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 months, my skin does get lighter.&lt;br /&gt;on the other side, after using this mask, skin feels very dry, so should use good moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, I suggest using this only once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> Great cream and work well, no problem, shipping fast</li>
    <li> It was really good for my face and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  DisappoinTed</li>
    <li> I have used the product 3 times in the last 2 weeks. I decided after reading the reviews that I would limit the use to 2 times a week because I did not want to dry out my face.  I use in conjunction with the Luminate.  The mask leaves my skin very soft and smooth, I have not seen any noticeable lightening of my dark spots. As I said, I have only used it 3 times in 2 weeks! I will provide another review after I have used it several more times.  I want to give it time to work…it’s only fair!</li>
    <li> It was okay, didn;t do much for my skin.</li>
    <li> it really does remove blackheads</li>
    <li> It feel really silky and easy to use. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> Face looks brighter clearer and moisturized. I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a week and have noticed instant results . Definitely ordering more .</li>
    <li> I used this product a little over a month. It does not work!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good mask. Does the job of getting rid of dark marks and discoloration</li>
    <li> I am Asian, and I am in my twenties. I have darkness on my skin caused by many, many old pimples. I used this product four times and the darkness is much less significant. This mask absorbs very well and I can smell a reassuring Vitamin C smell. Somehow my pores got smaller, though I don&#x27;t think this effect is entirely contributed by this mask.</li>
    <li> I received this at a GREAT price through Uberz.&lt;br /&gt;This is third week using on my husband&#x27;s legs that have multiple scars.  Thus cream has helped to diminish them.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> After using product just once, my face felt &amp; looked great! Left my skin soft &amp; smooth. I will continue to use product! Really recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This whitening mask is so gentle and you can use a little and still get the same results. I use it everyday while I shower or before bedtime. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out . my skin is clear so that was a MUST for me. I use it on blemishes and within a month they were all gone. The is the 2nd time buying . I bought it more for my mom bc she has sun spots and they are fading as well. It’s takinf a bit more time on her though</li>
    <li> not working for my skin, sorry to have to return it after used it for 10 days... but love the smell and texture clay. good service, I almost used the whole jar, but still got my money return, good job... thxxx</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too sure if this worked drastically for me. The first time I used it my face became very soft. I&#x27;m using this primarily to get rid of my acne scarring, not sure if it is working or not, but will continue to use daily until it is empty. don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this again because it&#x27;s not worth the price lol. I have provided a picture left is before right is after. I have been using this product daily for about 2 weeks now.</li>
    <li> This does not only help with the whitening of the dark marks. I noticed my face smoother. I love it!  I try to use it twice a day like others have said in reviews but even using it once I noticed fantastic results.</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin can use this mask almost daily. I apply thin amount to face neck, knees, elbows, under arms and wait 15 minutes. Wash off and apply the Swiss Botany SymWhite serum. Results are steady and even. It does not have the extreme drawing effects of clay mask...sort of like a clay tempered with cream...so not nearly as drying. Comes with a 100% guarantee. I like and will continue the regime. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working as a fade for my melisma on my cheek bones.</li>
    <li> After having this product for at least a month and meticulously putting it on every other day I saw a little bit result. However, I still don&#x27;t see a huge difference from the previous skin color.</li>
    <li> This seems to break me out more. I am African American- skin tone similar to Megan Good, but I noticed it gave me bumps after applying it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the Swiss Botany mask. I see it gradually lightening my dark spots particularly on the upper cheekbones and mid-cheek areas. I am 65 years old and have had lazer and chemical peels from a cosmetic surgeon. I am happy to have found a product that is affordable and that I can use without the assistance or expense of a doctor.</li>
    <li> not too happy...would request a refund</li>
    <li> Saw a difference from the first use..worth the money! Will order again!&lt;br /&gt;RHDC Studio is also a great body cream to use for dar spots</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to purchase this item. I&#x27;ve been really pleased with the other Swiss Botany products.</li>
    <li> Great product! It takes time to see results but is worth it. I have acne scars from a DIY that went wrong and using this product has significantly reduced the appearance of the scars it left behind. However I use it overnight on the affected areas rather than as instructed for  15 mins. Would definitely buy again once it runs out.</li>
    <li> I am very glad and very surprise at the results, because I have two big brown spots on my face, I am allergic to chocolate, and as a results of eating I got this spots the was very hard to go away from my face, but I am very surprise at the results with this Whitening C+Cream Mas to Whiten your skin.  Thank you for this outstanding product because my mother has sun spots and she is using it and it start to whitening her spots on her face.  I would recommend for people who has not try it to do not be scare, and go for it, I have a very sensitive skin but this works for me.</li>
    <li> Could not tell a difference in my age spots. I used the entire container with no changes.</li>
    <li> NO, I didn&#x27;t get this because I wanted to turn white!  LOL  I got it because I do have some darkish spots on my face that I would like lightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the lightening of the former injuries are not lightening after two days, but my skin feel very soft and &amp;#34;even more kissable&amp;#34; says my husband.  BUt also due to some side effect of my current mediation, but skin has been feeling unnaturally rough.  Only two nights using this and I&#x27;m already seeing an improvement in the roughness...good deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and made the mistake of leaving it longer than 15 minutes. My face was irritated the next day and I had to pile on make up to cover it up. My bad. I gave it another try and timed it exactly 5 minutes, this time irritation did not occur. Although it is early to tell if the product is effective, I noticed my skin tone is more even after one application. I will continue to use but will obey the &amp;#34;15 minute&amp;#34; instruction.</li>
    <li> Great product and the coustmer service is amazing I will order again:: the smell is amazing Go&#x27;s on smooth and easy to wash off. This clay mask really works all the vitamin C :: I will buy again I also use the serum after I wash off the mask for moisture</li>
    <li> Loves the mask, work well for me. Didn&#x27;t see any difference but still continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this jar of Swiss Botany whitening cream mask based on the positive reviews. It was a try to help fade some&lt;br /&gt;sunspots on the side of my face. After the first application, my face felt softer, although I was not expecting anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the whitening mask about 3 times a week and it has been a month now, I do see the sunspots fading and my skin tone is lighter and more even. I know it is not wishful thinking because my husband noticed that my face has become fairer. Let me also say that I apply the mask to my neck too. This product really works.</li>
    <li> I loved it!, I have sensitive skin, so I didn&#x27;t leave it on the full time as suggested in the instructions. It still worked great, and I will order it again as soon as I run low.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice so far with no noticeable difference at all.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to try for stretch marks that i couldn&#x27;t get rid off so it just works alittle bit,it helps but not that much.&lt;br /&gt;i think the reason is different for using it may be! thanks.</li>
    <li> I am looking for products to lighten brown spots on my cheeks (from sun and age).  I have used this mask twice and the results have been a brightened complexion, and feeling clean.  I love the texture of the mask, not too hard to spread and not runny.  I also like the light scent, not strong.  I will keep using this to see if it will lighten those spots.  Update: I found a routine that is effective.  I use this Whitening Mask (all over face) twice a week, and I use the Swiss Botany Whitening Serum (only on the spots) 4x a week at night.   Then I also use another brand&#x27;s Night Repair serum (all over face) on top, then the Swiss Botany Retinol Moisturizer (all over) 4 times a week, switching it off with another rich evening moisturizer to give my face a break from the retinol.  The result is noticeable lightening of the brown spots to the point where I don&#x27;t need a concealer (but I still need my foundation and setting powder).   P.S. I use SPF 30 in the daytime and not sit out in the sun on purpose (for tanning).</li>
    <li> This is the fourth day using the cream and I see a huge difference I&#x27;m my skin tone! I didn&#x27;t even use my liquid foundation today just a little powder and I was out the door! I love the texture of the clay mask and my skins super soft when I wash it off! I highly recommend this product I want to buy another one just for back up! Radiant skin for sure right away.</li>
    <li> BS I bought that only because of all the great reviews. It&#x27;s not clear the skin up . It&#x27;s not going to light your skin . And of course did not improve any sun spot damage. Just waste of money</li>
    <li> It is so fun doing it and letting it dry,  but once dry,  don&#x27;t laugh or it will wrinkle and make you feel a bit uncomfortable. It makes you look clean and refreshed after.  It has a nice lightening effect.</li>
    <li> Feels good and natural doesn&#x27;t sting or burn dries very quickly and rinses away very nicely......will continue to use regularly!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it worked. It is very expensive for a product that seemed to just clean my face. My acne and light scars did not change at all. Nor did the shade of my skin in general. Compared to a face cleanse it is not better.</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of this mask leaves the super soft face and my people notice the change in her , at this time in my life I&#x27;m not wearing makeup health problems from allergies and this mask helps maintain the freshness of my face. I&#x27;m happy with the results . I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me I guess it&#x27;s just me</li>
    <li> This stuff works crazy well. I am of Mediterranean descent, and this mask lightened my olive-ish skin several shades within a couple of weeks. I had to switch from using medium-toned tinted moisturizer to light-toned moisturizer! Very happy.</li>
    <li> I ended up using another brand so I can&#x27;t comment on how the skin smoothing works, but it did always make my skin very soft</li>
    <li> on time delivery. I have used 3 times so far, and looks like it works as it describes. My breakout cleared some. Wait for long time result. Hope to clear all my breakouts.</li>
    <li> Its very good whitening cream</li>
    <li> Awesome product! It really works</li>
    <li> It really brightens up my face and makes it soft after washing it off. I usually leave it on for 30+ minutes before showering or after washing my face with face wash. I am hoping it lightens up my face soon.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have had the whitening mask for about 6 weeks now, I am 32 with acne prone skin. I tried it while I had a small break out, using it about 3 times a week. It really helped to clear my skin up! My husband even asked what I was doing to make my skin clearer, since it helped clear up the red marks too. I apply it about 15 minutes before I shower, so I can just wash it off easily. I like the texture, it isn&#x27;t sticky or gel like, which I find unpleasant, it&#x27;s has a clay-like texture, and a pleasant, yet not strong, smell. It goes on easily and dries fast. It really deep cleaned my pores even on the first application, and I really noticed a difference overall in skin tone and texture within a week or two. I would definitely recommend this to all skin types!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this mask for about 3 weeks, and I am seeing gradual improvements in my complexion. I have oily , sensitive uneven dark skin, with occasional breakouts. I find that my skin is less oily, clear and clean with every use. This mask is gentle enough to use every day and work well with my skin care regiment. The only caveat was the container received was not filled with product, so I felt a bit cheated. Nevertheless; if the mask continue to live up to my expectations I will order again. I will also write a follow up review once all product is used.</li>
    <li> This mask works. It peels off lot of skin and helps brighten your skin. It is gentle and does not hurt your face. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> love the product. The skin became soft after the 1st time use. it will take some time to see if it can whiten the skin.</li>
    <li> Effective! It even dries my pimples and  fairer skin noticeable in 1 week. It&#x27;s perfect  for beauty regimen. This product is also good to get rid of wrinkles! It&#x27;s effective for me. Money back guaranteed!!!</li>
    <li> Been using it for the past couple of weeks and i noticed a significant difference in the dark spots on my face... I definitely recommend this product to my friends...</li>
    <li> Good but you need to be patient and keep using until it shows some results (no less than 15 days for me). It dries your skin so you need to apply lotion right after washing your face.</li>
    <li> I love it it smells really nice. works well and does show improvement if you stick to it. It&#x27;s helping my skin I do it once a week. I think everyone should just give it a try you can&#x27;t go wrong when you want to have results.</li>
    <li> Dry skin does not fit.</li>
    <li> This is a good product that I highly recommend, it&#x27;s relatively cheaper but it really worked on me.</li>
    <li> While I like this mask, I find it a little drying so I use it less frequently. It works with my other products in my battle to keep my skin tone balanced. That said, not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this for &amp;#34;whitening,&amp;#34; I am white enough as is.  It makes for a really nice mask, leaves skin very clean with a glow.  It also goes very far, as it has a very fine texture which spreads and covers easily.  I&#x27;m not sure it warrants the high price, but it is, in fact, a high quality product.</li>
    <li> After used this product after one week ( I did 3 times )  I can tell my skin tone is lighter even tho my foundation need to be changed.  Really happy with it !</li>
    <li> Its been 2-3 weeks I&#x27;m using this product. I have sensitive skin and this product didn&#x27;t hurt me at all. It definitely improved my skin tone a little. But, some black spots become more visible now due to overall skin lightening. I&#x27;m sure those spots would also fade away by continuing use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after using the whole box: Awesome product! I&#x27;m buying it again!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m liking the face mask.  It can be a little drying so you will need to moisterize right after using it.  I like the texture of my skin after using it.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for a month and a half I have fair skin and not fulfilled that promotes Swiss Botany because I have spots KPilaris and not lower tone with this product, I have tried others that have better skin whitening effect. Unfortunately even whiten skin following product recommendations.</li>
    <li> I have not used it regularly to judge its efficacy but, compared to other whitening creams, this has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I have used this mask only 3 times, and in the wk I&#x27;ve had it, my skin looks completely different! Age spots, dark circles, uneven skin tone, even my slight roceasa has improved! So so very pleased!!! I have light sensitive skin and this product does not dry out or sting my skin. LOVE. IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this mask</li>
    <li> worked in 4 days with my acne scars and has lighten my elbows and knees in a month. It works but will take a while for those areas.</li>
    <li> With all these positive reviews, I really thought that this product was overhyped- but I decided to give it a try anyway. Boy, am I glad I took the risk! This product is absolutely amazing- within just a couple days of use, my skin is clearer, less acne prone, and feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom! You can trust that this a regular review from a regular customer, I am absolutely in awe of this product and will definitely be a lifelong customer! Thank you Swiss Botany!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome item it actually brighten your skin ton but somehow i prefer a clay mask then creamy mask , may be because I have a very oily skin so that&#x27;s why I need a clay mask.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way, with all the Swiss Botany products....because they&#x27;re high quality products. I use a little bit of the mask before I shower each day (it&#x27;s easier to wash off that way) It makes me my skin feel fresh and renewed and is helping with some acne scars I have as well.</li>
    <li> Used a few times and can definitely see improvements in a few scars/discolorations.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery . Product is creamy and cool to apply. So far no issues . I have dark circles under my eyes and the cream has done a good job with keeping my face moisturize.</li>
    <li> It unfortunately did nothing for me. My skin looks just the same- no whitening, no clearing, no toning whatsoever. It may work for other people, but for me it was a waste of a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Its been 4 days now since using this product and I can see my pimples are clearing up.&lt;br /&gt;Been using a lot of product and home remedies but still nothing helps my acne until I bump in this and read the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Ill post again when my acne and dark spots due to acne will totally disappear.</li>
    <li> I just ordered it, im wondering can i use it only at the top of my dark spots? I wish lighten only the spots and not my whole face.</li>
    <li> i got the bottle and it was half used. disgusting. i thought i would get a new one but it was just scooped out of and i threw it away immediately.</li>
    <li> I have oily and acne prone skin and after a couple of days using this product it does the job very well. It reduces my acne while also whiten my skin and fading my acne scars...</li>
    <li> have not used it often as it&#x27;s pretty drying and I have dry skin, but if a person has oily skin this would work well I think...wish I had this product when I was a teenager!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It works great and feels wonderful after the first application. I have been using it for two weeks now and have noticed a difference on how even and bright my skin has become. My dark spots have lightened a lot and there is just a new glow to my skin I never had before. The only issue I have with this product is the price. Although a little will go a long way, in my opinion, it&#x27;s still too expensive for me to be able to afford every month.</li>
    <li> this is W0RK GREAT!I FEEL MY FACE VERY CLEAN AND GL0W.THANK U?</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for several years and I am now starting to age in the sense to where my skin is changing.  I&#x27;ve slowed down on the tanning, but still go once or twice a week...more for what I consider health benefits than too get tan. (I put sunscreen on my face.)  I noticed after I turned 30 that I started to get a brown, blotchiness on my forehead that was always worse after tanning.  As the years have gone by, the brown blotchiness has become pretty prominent on both sides of my face also.  Last summer my husband asked me why my skin was so \\&quot;speckly\\&quot; on the side my face?  I thought, oh great, it&#x27;s becoming noticeable to other people.&lt;br /&gt;I was never professionally diagnosed, but recently I came across a term called melasma, and this is what I believed the brown \\&quot;splotchiness\\&quot; to be on my face, so I took to researching products that would help that out.  I decided on Swiss Botany, mainly because it didn&#x27;t include hydroquinone in the ingredients listed...I read about some pretty bad side effects from that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had Swiss Botany for about a month now and I think I&#x27;ve use it about twice a week on average and the brown \\&quot;splotchiness\\&quot; seems to be fading, I can see my peaches and cream complexion coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this product 4 stars because I really feel like it&#x27;s too soon to tell if Swiss Botany will completely get rid of the melasma on my face.  It&#x27;s fading the spots enough so far that I will continue to use it and see if I get better results.</li>
    <li> It has a very nice orange type smell. :) I love how it dries on my skin without any irritation . It has lots of product and will last for a long time.honestly I did not notice any significant change on my skin since I started using it. I am using it 3 days every week religiously . Hopefully it will bring out the best of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;No breakouts or problem. It&#x27;s exactly what I thought it was going to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is lightening my skin or not but it does help with my acne. The label says to leave on for 15 mins but it is so gentle I even leave it on for an hour. After I wash it off, my skin is smoother. My skins texture is def improving and I hope to update about the whitening effects soon as I do gave some darker areas on my face that I want to even out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week. It&#x27;s too early to comment. I hope to experience what others have with spectacular ratings!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for long enough yet but I can see a difference in just a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will come back to expand on this review in a month and hope that helps.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel soft ....even makes my make up look better...love it ..will definitely purchase again..</li>
    <li> Excellent. I have used a lot of masks but I was not satisfied. This product is easy to apply and to remove.  It whitens and smoothens my skin. I love the feeling and texture of my skin every time I use it. It gives shines also. I buy this product again.</li>
    <li> great product - i love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pricey. However, I do think that it remotely lightens the skin and evens out skin tone. I use it a few times a week and it has not hurt my skin in any way. It smells nice, looks brighter after rinsing, and looks like it&#x27;s doing what it claims to do. Way overpriced, though.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product, its leaves my skin glowing and I have seem lightening in my hyperpigmentation. If your south asian and struggling with pigmentation around the month area this the product for you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, very greasy and it does not fade my freckles at all or post acne scars. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> No EFFECT AFTER 3 WEEK!No whitening! So disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels on my skin. I been using this cream for a short time and have noticed some changes. I&#x27;ll keep you posted</li>
    <li> This is my second week using this product and I love it! I love it so much I already bought another one. I use it four times a week and noticed a difference with my hyper-pigmentation and raccoon eyes circles after the first application. I was happy that my sister remarked on the difference the next day. We should all keep in mind that not every product works for everyone and it takes longer for some people to notice lasting change. I will post again in a few months.</li>
    <li> I really love this mask.. It leaves a nice fair glow to your skin.. My skin is much fair and blemish free</li>
    <li> Not effective at all.. used for 3 weeks no results or improvement.</li>
    <li> I am pleased to find a substantial quality product at a good price  I have used it twice, and I do see some results.  I am hoping that in time and with additional use I will experience the ultimate result.  Thank you for the offering with this corporation!.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been used no this for about 5 weeks and have yet to see any results. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Not sure this did anything? Soft and smoother skin is all.</li>
    <li> That works but need more time to see</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I noticed a difference right away</li>
    <li> Awesome mask!! It makes your skin softer and smoother. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this one, I used it a few times (every other days for two weeks) and felt it was extremely drying for my skin. I didn&#x27;t think there was any instant glow or lightening as tooted by some reviews, I just felt really dry and matted (hopefully thats makes sense) I have pretty bad hyper pigmentation hence why I purchased this, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed so I&#x27;ve put it to the side. I&#x27;m also having some acne breakout at the moment so I&#x27;m on meds and prescription medication till that calms down. Perhaps I&#x27;ll return to it after it&#x27;s calmed down and see if it works (better?) but for now, it is not in my beauty regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> whitening cream mask is a great product to buy, if you have damaged skin and if you&#x27;re looking into whitening your skin tone. It seems to increase the growth rate of the skin cells, which is necessary to repair the uneven skin. If you end up purchasing this product be sure to use a lotion to moisturize your skin because if you do not use lotion, it will dry your skin.</li>
    <li> I think this product is over rated. I used the whole bottle and it didn&#x27;t anything to my skin. After reviewing all the good reviews, I thought this product would help with my dark spots, but it did absolutely nothing. Other than my dark spots, I have pretty nice skin. Never really had any breakouts or anything. Bought the product hoping it would help with my dark spots, there was no difference between &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; so, I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottome line, I would not recommend if you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing it for dark spots like me.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and I was lucky enough to get one FREE! As someone who suffered from mild acne as a teenager I needed something to fade some of the dark spots on my cheek! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 days in a row,so far on my face, neck and underarm, and the areas got a little lighter and dark patches are less noticeable, a little does not go a long way with this mask but it does make your skin  lighter.</li>
    <li> I receive the jar unsealed.  It looked as if I inherited from my mother who didn&#x27;t care for it and decided to give it to me.  However, the produce itself appears to work well.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen any results in terms of evening skin tone or brightening. paired with a vitamin c serum and saw no results.</li>
    <li> No differnce after several months use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this mask a few times but I&#x27;m very happy with it .  I have super sensitive skin and this is Very gentle with a mild hint of citrus no heavy perfumes or artificial anything .  Highly recommend if you want a gentle mask that will give your skin a nice healthy glow without harsh chemicals or abrasives !  I use it twice a week now in the cold weather but will use if more the summer  I&#x27;m sure !</li>
    <li> The cream leaves my skin lighter but it is dry, so I do not know if using it more than once a week. It closes my pore, which is nice. I need more time to say if my brown spots would disappear, so I would have to update this review at a later date.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for 2 weeks and honestly I already started to see some results.  I can&#x27;t wait for the 6 weeks mark that everyone keeps talking about so I can see even more results!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you!</li>
    <li> Not as good as Borghesa.</li>
    <li> It works! My face is smoother and my freckles and age spots got lighter. I have been using this for three weeks and would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by this product. I&#x27;ve only used a couple times and each time there was a minor change in my skin tone . I&#x27;m curious if the ingredients are good for your skin but I was impressed with it. I don&#x27;t use that often because it is a tad drying but it does what it says.</li>
    <li> It was great. My face is better, and whiter. Thank you so much. It was so amazing. I am gonna buy again.</li>
    <li> Feels nice. I think id need to use it more regularly to see optimal results. Good on the spot pimple zapper though.</li>
    <li> So far I think it&#x27;s working great!</li>
    <li> I bought this product over a month ago and didn&#x27;t want to write a review too quickly. I noticed results in the first week already. I have been using it for over a month now and my dark acne marks are fading, the rest of my face is lighter and brighter. I&#x27;m very happy with the results, thank you Swiss Botany!</li>
    <li> Was not good product, didn&#x27;t work very expensive because did nothing. I used it everyday for two months and it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter, she has been using it so far, but I think it will have the effect in the long run. So far the shipping was fast. I will update with the quality of the product later when I see a difference or not.</li>
    <li> This mask is a general whitening/lightening mask, which means that if you have dark marks on your face that you&#x27;re trying to get rid of you need to apply the mask very, very carefully to only those dark spots. I&#x27;ve used the mask several times now and put it all over my face. Well my dark spots are lighter but my entire face is lighter too so the dark spots didn&#x27;t really go away at all. I realize that I&#x27;m going to have to get a 15x magnifying mirror (or something) and very carefully apply the mask over just the dark spots so that it will lighten those.</li>
    <li> I love this mask, it is like clay like texture. After I wash it off I see clear, beautiful radiant skin. I recommend this product. I can see the difference already and I have only used it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to be really sure of it, but it is very easy to use1</li>
    <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve used this about four times since I bought it.  I have some discoloration on my face from taking Accutane so I bought this product in hopes of lightening it.  After my last use last night I noticed that there is a small difference in the color and when I put my makeup on it seems to hide it better! Maybe it&#x27;s working! Going to keep using hopefully there will be more of a substantial difference.</li>
    <li> I just recently ordered this product and so far I like the ingredients and it has a very nice fragrance. I don&#x27;t know how often to use it because there aren&#x27;t directions that specify how often to do a facial treatment, so far I&#x27;ve used it 1x/week for the 2 weeks that I&#x27;ve had it. I am eager to see some great results as far as lightening my dark spots and evening my skin tone so I&#x27;ll write another update after about a month or so.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in the area of application as yet.&lt;br /&gt;However, since it does contain good ingredients I will continue using it until it is gone and&lt;br /&gt;see by then the final results.</li>
    <li> Kind of skeptical about it but it really works. Slowly but surely. I can see the difference. I use every morning or if I forget, then at night before I go to bed. It does dry my skin out a little bit but that&#x27;s why you have lotion lol. I usually leave it on for about 15-18 minutes but that&#x27;s just me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good ,just takea a while to do it.</li>
    <li> No break out so for my face is more event toned, which is a plus for me. I started using just once a week, I don&#x27;t want to be to white my spots begins to lighten also.</li>
    <li> I use it twice a week, and I feel it&#x27;s tightness on my face, and my pores are less visible after I wash off. It doesn&#x27;t sting or hurt my face, it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with some dark spots, mostly the result of acne scars. It seems to be helping a little with that, but what I really like about this product is it cleared up acne immediately and made my skin brighter and skin tone more even. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that, so it was a nice bonus and it is good enough that even if it doesn&#x27;t really do what I hoped for the dark spots, I will keep using this. I think I will just need more time to see if the dark spots go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product smells nice!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any skin brightening so I just use it to clean my skin once a week from make up and pollution</li>
    <li> I am having acne and scarring because of some hormonal changes and wanted to get them cleared as they affect your confidence. Bought this item with intention of getting them cleared. Having been using this product regularly for about 2 weeks now in the morning. I wash it off while bathing. I might have gotten more fairer which is not visible to me as such until I apply my foundation. But it hasn&#x27;t cleared my acne scars. There might be very little improvement but not much, Will keep using it...</li>
    <li> I  tried using it in the morning to clear my face , it works very well</li>
    <li> My face had a nasty break out from using this. I really wanted to make this work but unfortunately had to throw out the jar after one use.</li>
    <li> I love this whitening mask.  My face feels softer and cleaner after using it.  I use it in the evenings and go to bed with my face feeling fresh.  It also evens out the tone in my face and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> After reading so many review I decided to give it a try and I can say this product is good and makes you to look fresh but overall not soo impressive but I did not had any breakout even though I have sensitive skin.May be not best for me, I&#x27;l look for some other.</li>
    <li> Great product ,would recommend ,plan to buy more in the future</li>
    <li> I used this for about a month, and liked it for the first few weeks. I can&#x27;t say that it lightened any dark spots, however, I can say that it has made me break out. I stopped using it two weeks ago, and my skin is finally getting back to normal.</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and its very noticeable difference on my face.  I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> It is good but not moisture enough</li>
    <li> I have been using Swiss botany whitening mask for 2 weeks (3 times a week for 20 minutes) but I haven&#x27;t seen any whitening effect yet on my dark spot on my cheeks. I will still continue using this, hopefully positive result will be seen in a few months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for six weeks now. Wanted to give it enough time to see if it was working. I have been  very pleased with the results. I have used other products of this type without much success. The dark areas on my face have become less noticeable. I no longer need to use concealer on most areas anymore. I&#x27;ve even started using it on the dark spots on the backs of my hands. My face and hands are soft, supple and more youthful looking. Can&#x27;t ask for anything more. I will continue using  this as it certainly works.</li>
    <li> Not sure why it works for some and not others!?  Didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this really worked tbh but it does make the skin feel smoother and a little bit clearer. Not sure if I&#x27;d buy again though tbph.</li>
    <li> First time using any type of whitening mask and this one really works so far. My dark spots are noticeably faded after a week usage. I highly recommend to anyone. Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product three times now and see no difference in skin tone but the little bumps on my chin went away so whats not to love?</li>
    <li> Did not work ! Got cheated with the wrong 5 star reviews.I guess these are fake reviews.</li>
    <li> Definitely works.  Glad I bought it. It has already tremendously lightened my acne scars on my chin.  I&#x27;ve inly been using for two weeks.  Every other day.</li>
    <li> Not sure how much whitening it is doing, but my skin is clearer/smoother and little breakouts tend to heal a little faster. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I needed this product to even out my very light skin that is decorated with some sun spots. Is a good mask for evening out skin skin tones.</li>
    <li> Wow, I gotta say that I am truly impressed. I am 23, and I used to have a lot of acne due to stress from college, work, etc. So now that I graduated, I don&#x27;t really get acne, but my skin still HAD those horrible red acne scars. It was horrible! I have been using this mask 3 times a week for about a two weeks now and WOW. The redness has reduced like 80%! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I will keep using it and update this review if anything changes, but as for now.. this stuff works!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I will purchase it again! It really works! I can see the difference the first I used it.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I never had a product actually work the way it promised it would!  I saw a difference in one application.  It faded my dark spots from sun damage and post acne and evened out my skin tone to where there was truly a noticeable difference.  Im excited to continue using this, because if it continues to work as it did the first time it will be the find of a life time!  I have tried so many products that promise the same thing but nothing has worked as well as this.  Not even the prescription bleaching creams.</li>
    <li> Is excellent , I love the way my skin look!</li>
    <li> The Swiss Whitening Cream Mask is a wonderful product, and the reason I have not awarded the 5th star is the short amount of time I have been using it. In three weeks, my sun spots are much lighter, and the small ones have disappeared. I use the Mask twice a week for 10 minutes. I have a very sensitive skin, and this Mask is one of the few products that doesn&#x27;t cause break downs. I will write another review as I continue using the product.</li>
    <li> Nothing yet and it leaves my skin dry</li>
    <li> This is honestly taking quiet a long time to lighten my dark spots. Not happy... Although, this product WAS able to dramatically lighten the large horizontal patch of uneven skin tone on my forehead. I&#x27;m almost out of this and it&#x27;s only been a week. I&#x27;d expect more from a product with an average rating of 4.5...</li>
    <li> It works as descriped</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s so thick, creamy, and smooth and it smells amazing. It goes on really evenly and washes off easily. Noticeable improvement in dark spots! My face does feel a little dry after the mask, so make sure to apply your moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and I am yet to notice any effect on my skin. I will not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a strong believer in taking the best care of myself, so ever so often I&#x27;ll try something new, so after reading the description I decided to give swiss botany whitening maskva try and am glad I did, it leaves my skin feeling smoothe and looking clear. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> seems to work...however, time will tell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to two months now and have yet to see any positive results. I bought it to lighten some acne scars and a really horrible dark strip above my upper lip(I&#x27;ve had it since I was little and it gives the impression that I have a mustache; but I don&#x27;t). I&#x27;ve been using 3-4 times a week for 15 minutes, but nothing has changed. It&#x27;s frustrating since I was hoping that i had finally found a product that would help me. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s has been only a few weeks but I think it&#x27;s working. I am using it for melasma.everyone is asking me if I had laser surgery for melasma. I wasn&#x27;t sure until everyone start asking secretly If I was doing something special.i guess my face s so clear that people start noticing my lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it actually works!  My face is the darkest part of my body so it will take time to achieve the results I want.  But I see progress.  I&#x27;ve used it on my hands, knees, elbows, and feet.  Yes my feet.  I live in Texas and they darkened quite a bit over time.  After one application I can see a difference everywhere I have used it.  I will keep ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Works as well in softening skin as my other mask.&lt;br /&gt;Far as whitening, it&#x27;s not as effective...though I had only been applying it 3-4 times weekly for the last 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not stingy in application, so the bottle would only last me 6 weeks at most since I have less than 1/2 a bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;Not contemplating in reorder...</li>
    <li> i love this product it makes my face glow and look younger</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I have used this consistently once a week for 2 months and it helps clear pimples, whiteheads and it really does even out your skin tone.</li>
    <li> good stuff for hyper-pigmentation. not good for all over face or red spots (made my face look really white). i have clear, white skin with a few acne scars that didn&#x27;t fade after daily use for a couple weeks. now i use it just for the brown spots and under the eyes. but it only works if i use it daily.</li>
    <li> This product does not work for weeks later and no change don&#x27;t waste your money a bunch of fake reviews</li>
    <li> Love this product it help lighten my skin and the dark spot from pimples.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian with light skin and bought this to treat the dark sun spots on my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month, every other day. So far I have yet to see any changes on my face. I will continue to use it in hopes of a miracle but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The texture of this mask is thick and it has Kaolin in it so it feels a little like a clay mask, but more moist. You get a lot of product in one jar and a little goes a very long way! I have been using this in conjunction with the Swiss Botany Whitening Cream Serum and I have seen a difference in my hyperpigmentation. My acne scars have lightened dramatically in just a few days!</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;This mask does exactly what it says it will do! It clears up uneven skin tone and leaves your skin feeling, and looking beautiful, soft, and clean! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> As someone who deals with the slight occasional brake out, this product has really helped with fading the discoloration left behind by blemishes and has helped with the scaring left behind overall has helped with achieving a uniform complexion . I also spend allot of time in the sun not by choice but it has helped with keeping my complexion on the lighter side. I love this mask, I preferably use it before bed, and follow with a moisturizer</li>
    <li> I feel the skin become refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Invest for the skin. Will be repurchased.</li>
    <li> My pores are getting small and my face is getting smoother. I have been using it almost 1 month .</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few days and notice my skin is clear and smooth...it eliminated some uneven spots that I had on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this mask!!! It really does work, and I was skeptical originally. Definitely recommend.  I received this free to test and my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This product works well. It is not greasy and it smells good.</li>
    <li> Just received it and started using so not quite sure yet how well its working. But for the first week I have felt that my skin is smoother!</li>
    <li> Very good.  My daughter and I  use this cream twice in a week.</li>
    <li> The products packing was excellent but the product actually darkened my skin instead of brightening it.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel soft .People say my face now glows.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work that well for me. It dried my skin out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been using it for a month and I can see good results. I even recommended it to a friend after she commented on the improvements to my face, and even she is happy with the results since she started using it.  My face is smoother and clearer. I will definitely be buying more products from swiss botany.</li>
    <li> Okay let me start by saying, this product is amazing. I didnt want to do a review after the first day but after a week of using it and it has made my face, clearer, smoother, lighter, softer. Its cleared up my acne scars and dark spots under my eyes and everyones said my face looks so much better. I also am I caramel skinned african american girl and its lightened my face (for those looking for lightening) but this isnt BLEACH its more like a toner and whitener for uneven skin so if youre looking for a product that changes your skintone that drastically this isnt for you, but if youre looking for a clearer, lighter, smoother, complexion then i would defenitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have used this product 2 times and so far have no unpleasant reaction to it and  it&#x27;s working, so I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Received package really fast. The company emailed me instructions and i followed the instructions down to the letter. I have been using the cream 3 times a week as instructed. I see a little difference which is fine. I do not want some quick damaging effect. I can tell this will be a 5 to 6 month process to get the even skin tone i was hoping for. As others stated do not leave on longer than 20 minutes because it really dries out your skin. So far i am happy with the results because i am not looking for quick microwaveable results. If you are try another product!  This product works but its at a natural slower pace.</li>
    <li> Great mask could see the difference after first use. Face looked cleaner and brighter. Very gentle can use everyday.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Fast arrival.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than two months and happy to say I am seeing gradual improvements in my overall facial complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive uneven dark skin, with occasional breakouts and I usually stay away from most masks because they break out my skin. I have not had any break outs ever since I started using this product as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good but one needs to be patient, keep using and also remember to apply a moisturizer after washing it off.</li>
    <li> I initially purchased the whitening cream mask to help with acne scars on my face. I am a brown skinned female, and I used this product twice a week for the past 4 weeks and I have not noticed a difference in my skin tone or a reduction in the appearance of my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this product has helped shrink down my pimples after using, but as far as using this product as a &amp;#34;whitening mask&amp;#34; it has not worked for me which is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this product is the best of the best, and I know what am talking about. My skin is sensitive that am always changing products, but am going to hold on to this wonderful product and am going to try a lot of swiss botany&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you guys</li>
    <li> I love this mask! It makes my skin look even and light.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and already my dark spots are gone. I HIGHLY recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> Works well on my post-acne scars and melasma.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> my skin is well for whitening cream</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Smells good. Still waiting for results. Used it for 3 weeks now, Applying twice a week, no visible results yet. Will continue to use it and hope for some result. Only then I will know if its really worth the price?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and I won&#x27;t purchase again. Unfortunately, I did not noticed any whitening, but it does make my face feel softer afterwards; however, it&#x27;s definitely not worth the asking price. I&#x27;m probably better off with my resources spent towards glycolic peel at home treatment to prompt the production of new collagen and elastin.</li>
    <li> My mother is 70 years old and her dark spot really bother her so when this was offered to me during a promotion i went ahead and asked her to try it. I can honestly say that I can see a dramatic difference in the few days she has used it. She loves the way it works, she feels and looks years younger, I love this product because it has brought my mothers smile back to her face.</li>
    <li> Looks like skin was fine and feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;My face would help whiten the skin brought good results.</li>
    <li> I have blotchy discoloration around my nose and forehead. I have been using this product for almost 3 weeks and I&#x27;m already seeing results. It&#x27;s not a complete cure-all, but it is definitely producing a smoother more uniformed look on my skin. Thank you! I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after more use and time passes.</li>
