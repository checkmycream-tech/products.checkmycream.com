      <li>I hope it&#x27;s helpful to you! :)</li>
      <li>overall I&#x27;m very happy with this wig and would buy it again!</li>
      <li>I also read in a reviewthat the top is frizzy.</li>
      <li>I ended up not using this wig for the original goal, but it is still a nice wig.</li>
      <li>wig is very smooth and easy to brush.</li>
      <li>The Cf-fashion wig manufacture send a handwrite letter with agift, which I think it was super nice of them.</li>
      <li>Not only did this fit perfectly without any budging, it also felt and looked flattering.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cool and seems durable</li>
      <li>If you have any doubt in your mind that you shouldn&#x27;t buy this because it&#x27;s not the right color, I personally promise you it&#x27;s the perfect color for Asuna, it couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
      <li>These were all easy fixes, though.</li>
      <li>The light brown looks more like the light gold picture.</li>
      <li>There are no visible &amp;#34;bald patches&amp;#34; when wearing the wig and the hair itself is pretty nice looking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty adept with wig styling, so this wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not bad :)&lt;</li>
      <li>The front looks perfectly fine</li>
      <li>Like the reviews say the bangs aren&#x27;t cut, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very good that the bangs aren&#x27;t cut though, and there is a very logical reason then dont come cut: people have different size foreheads.</li>
      <li>I ordered the light brown one</li>
      <li>I ordered this wig in the light brown color.</li>
      <li>I loved how they included a wig cap for you and gave you a safe net to keep your wig in.</li>
      <li>Wig color is perfect (light brown), length and style is dead on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived in about a week and a half, which was a very pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In the end I ended up ordering the light brown one, I was hoping what everyone was saying about the light brown one was true.</li>
      <li>The seller was kind enough to send me a cute hair scrunchie and a free wig cap as well.</li>
      <li>I bought this wig to originally use with my Asuna costume during Halloween.</li>
      <li>Well, they&#x27;re right!</li>
      <li>but overall it is a good</li>
      <li>The seller is very kind and even gave me an extra gift with the wig.&lt;br /&gt;The wig fibers are high quality and easy to work with</li>
      <li>So I ordered the light brown one, hoping they were right.</li>
      <li>I am very petite and have a smaller sized head (lol)</li>
      <li>I actually put the wig next to my wig of Heroine from Amnesia and it was almost a perfect match.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m telling you right now, buy this wig, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>it arrived, the color was not at all the light brown shown in the photo (more of an orange-peachy blonde) and the top of the wig was very matted and tangled.</li>
      <li>I was a little iffy on whether to order the light brown or the orange wig, and I am very glad to have gone with the light brown version.</li>
      <li>Well to start with my review, I totally, definetely, absolutely, love the wig!</li>
      <li>Honestly I probably would have gotten the gold color instead because the light brown is a little bit too light in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is perfect, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as it&#x27;s just too thin to be acceptable.</li>
      <li>and I own a vast collection of wigs to know the difference...</li>
      <li>I got the light brown version according to my order but it seems to be more blonde than anything.</li>
      <li>so I had to fix that as well, and the photo of the light brown seems to have reduced saturation, because the actual color is a bit more orange than what they show.</li>
      <li>The only con was the bangs were longer than i had thought it to be, but other than that it was perfect!</li>
      <li>It came in literally a week, so it was super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>After reading the other reviews and assuming this was a good choice for my cosplay, I decided to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>And they were right.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just about the right length on me</li>
      <li>For the price, the hair looks realistic and isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;plastic-looking&amp;#34; as cheap wigs often are.</li>
      <li>the length is great and the colour actually works but the braid and overall amount of hair seem.. lacking.</li>
      <li>The seller wrote me a cute note and gave me both a wig cap and an extra gift.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m about 4&#x27;11&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>(I had a cute rapunzel costume last year but the wig I bought for it was horrendous!)</li>
      <li>So anyways, when I first took the wig out of the package I was actually pretty upset with the color</li>
      <li>Be prepared to style it yourself if you want the wig to look exact.</li>
      <li>Exactly one week.</li>
      <li>:) I would definitely recommend to any asuna cosplayer!</li>
      <li>And, if you don&#x27;t have it a certain way, or if you move around too much, you can see right through the netting.</li>
      <li>The texture of the wig is so soft and it doesn&#x27;t tangle that easy, and if it does it fastly untangles with a normal brush!</li>
      <li>I wrote this HUGE review because I know I was skeptical about buying this, and a review like this really could have helped me with being more confident in my decision.</li>
      <li>The wig is very long and looks extremely natural, like it&#x27;s your own hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very thick wig and it is a great price.</li>
      <li>When I reading through the reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get the light brown or the peach one, it was hard to decide.</li>
      <li>I was hoping the braid was much thicker</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I hate this so much. The color is nice, but it tangles worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve had to put this wig to the side because all of the problems it&#x27;s caused me. I totally do NOT recommend this wig to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself is much too small for some people. And, if you don&#x27;t have it a certain way, or if you move around too much, you can see right through the netting. Hate it. I&#x27;m not even going to deal with posting a photo, not worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this wig twice, heck no.</li>
    <li> The wig was very nicely put together and had the wig caps as well! Beautiful, silky and the right color! The only con was the bangs were longer than i had thought it to be, but other than that it was perfect! :) I would definitely recommend to any asuna cosplayer!</li>
    <li> I ordered the light brown option because everyone else kept saying it would match Asuna&#x27;s hair perfectly. Well, they&#x27;re right! I actually put the wig next to my wig of Heroine from Amnesia and it was almost a perfect match. The wig is very long and looks extremely natural, like it&#x27;s your own hair. My only issue is that the bangs were not already cut like they are in the photo. They were cut into that stereotypical anime cut that most wigs have where one slice of hair goes down the middle of your forehead and stops at the middle of your nose. The braid was also too low on the head. These were all easy fixes, though. Overall, I recommend this wig.</li>
    <li> Honestly I probably would have gotten the gold color instead because the light brown is a little bit too light in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, here we go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a good wig. There are no visible &amp;#34;bald patches&amp;#34; when wearing the wig and the hair itself is pretty nice looking. For the price, the hair looks realistic and isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;plastic-looking&amp;#34; as cheap wigs often are. It&#x27;s just about the right length on me (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3) and it comes down to about my waist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me as if it has enough hair. It&#x27;s a little bit thin, and a few strands will come out when you brush it. This is normal though, and isn&#x27;t really a con. All wigs will shed a little bit. Also, as stated in a few other reviews, the bangs really aren&#x27;t cut very well for the character. They&#x27;re passable, but they don&#x27;t look like the picture advertised. Be prepared to style it yourself if you want the wig to look exact. I&#x27;m pretty adept with wig styling, so this wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. Be prepared for it to tangle. This is normal, and isn&#x27;t a fault of the wig. Long hair tangles. There&#x27;s no way to stop it. So maybe invest in a detangler spray as well.</li>
    <li> So the color is completely different, which was what I was betting on! I was a little skeptical about ordering the light brown version, because it seems to be like the color says, light brown, and that&#x27;s not Asuna&#x27;s color. But I read into the reviews and people said that it turned out to be an orange/peachy color. So I ordered the light brown one, hoping they were right. And they were right. The color is literally SPOT ON to Asuna&#x27;s color. If you have any doubt in your mind that you shouldn&#x27;t buy this because it&#x27;s not the right color, I personally promise you it&#x27;s the perfect color for Asuna, it couldn&#x27;t be better. It&#x27;s a very thick wig and it is a great price. The bangs, like other reviews said, are not cut, but it&#x27;s a simple fix and easy to do yourself, watch tutorials on youtube! Basically there is 3 sections of hair. The back which goes down to about my butt and I am 5&#x27;4 1/2. Then there is the sections of hair that asuna keeps in front of her and that goes down to just below my bust. Then there is the bangs and those rest at the bottom of the chin. It&#x27;s very good that the bangs aren&#x27;t cut though, and there is a very logical reason then dont come cut: people have different size foreheads. It&#x27; s just easier to fit everyone&#x27;s needs if they are uncut so people can tailor them to their own faces. Anyways, I read in a review that the braid is too heavy and so it falls down and they had to pin it up. I personally did not have that problem because I have a very large head ^.^ so the braid stay snug in place, and in reality should stay in place unless you&#x27;re a small person. But it wouldn&#x27;t be any hassle to pin really. Also, the braid is a little thinner than it appears. It&#x27;s the same size as it is in the picture, but keep in mind that it&#x27;s a long wig so the proportions of how big the braids actually are is a little thrown off. Anyways, it&#x27;s no downside really, it&#x27;s a perfectly fine size for the braid and rather thick compared to other Asuna wigs. I also read in a reviewthat the top is frizzy. Unfortunately with some wigs like this, the top can be a little frizzy. So basically YES it is a little frizzy, but it&#x27;s very very flat and unless someone is inspecting the top of your head with a magnifying glass, really it&#x27;s not a big deal. The front looks perfectly fine and it&#x27;s not effected at all. All in all, I&#x27;m telling you now, you will NOT find a better wig than this for this price, any if you had any doubt that this wasn&#x27;t the wig for your Asuna cosplay, completely get rid of that doubt because this wig is so perfect, I&#x27;m so happy with it. ALSO may I add, I live in Florida and the wig was all the way in China, and naturally I thought it would take a while to get here and the expected shipping dates were anywhere from May 2- May 22 so I thought it would get here late may or early april, but today is April 19th and when I checked my mail, to my most joyful surprise, my wig was there! It was the fastest shipping I&#x27;ve ever had for packages from China and I&#x27;m just so pleased with that. I&#x27;m telling you right now, buy this wig, it&#x27;s worth it! I wrote this HUGE review because I know I was skeptical about buying this, and a review like this really could have helped me with being more confident in my decision.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews and assuming this was a good choice for my cosplay, I decided to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, the color was not at all the light brown shown in the photo (more of an orange-peachy blonde) and the top of the wig was very matted and tangled. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The wig is a bit darker than shown in the pictures. The light brown looks more like the light gold picture. Beautiful quality and not tangled at all. Came with a wig cap.</li>
    <li> This wig came in a week after a bought it. Exactly one week. I am so pleased with it. The hair is beautiful but, you may have to trim the bangs a tiny bit. I loved how they included a wig cap for you and gave you a safe net to keep your wig in. Will defiantly order from here again.</li>
    <li> I ended up not using this wig for the original goal, but it is still a nice wig. A little different in color but that&#x27;s ok. The seller wrote me a cute note and gave me both a wig cap and an extra gift. I highly recommend this wig and this seller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the PERFECT wig for Asuna or Rapunzel! :) I bought this wig to originally use with my Asuna costume during Halloween. Unfortunately the costume didn&#x27;t come in on time so I decided to be Rapunzel. (I had a cute rapunzel costume last year but the wig I bought for it was horrendous!) I braided the wig and added some fake flowers I glued to bobby pins and let&#x27;s just say it looked amazing. I am very petite and have a smaller sized head (lol) so finding hats/wigs is difficult for me. Not only did this fit perfectly without any budging, it also felt and looked flattering. I received so many compliments and didn&#x27;t want to take it off! I highly recommend this wig to anyone.</li>
    <li> The seller is very kind and even gave me an extra gift with the wig.&lt;br /&gt;The wig fibers are high quality and easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;It needed a little styling but overall it is a good wig.&lt;br /&gt;And I will continue to buy from Cf-fashion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig in the light brown color. I was a little iffy on whether to order the light brown or the orange wig, and I am very glad to have gone with the light brown version. I highly reccomend the light brown color for any future person that is going to order this. It fits her color perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in about a week and a half, which was a very pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is very smooth and easy to brush. I am super happy with it. My only concerns was that the bangs of the wig are longer and are not trimmed like they are in the photo. This is a small problem, since I am not good with cutting hair. Also, The braid of the wig was very loose and further down the head. I fixed this, and was not a big deal. The bangs are a little bit more upsetting and have not been fixed yet,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the bangs, I am very pleased with this product. The seller was kind enough to send me a cute hair scrunchie and a free wig cap as well. I would highly reccomend this wig to any Asuna cosplayer, as long as they are good with cutting and styling wigs.</li>
    <li> The bangs were barely cut at all, had to cut it myself. The braid was crooked so I had to fix that as well, and the photo of the light brown seems to have reduced saturation, because the actual color is a bit more orange than what they show. (Though definitely Asuna&#x27;s color, so if you&#x27;re cosplaying Asuna go for the light brown) - I expected a few problems so nonetheless I really do like this wig! It also comes with a free wig cap!</li>
    <li> The wig color is great, the cut is really nice, and the material is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this wig is how the bangs are cut. Its a simple fix and otherwise the wig is great!&lt;br /&gt;Came with a cute ponytail holder, too!</li>
    <li> The hair is unbelievably thin. It barely covers the netting underneath and the braid is so small that it&#x27;s barely noticeable. I can&#x27;t add any from the rest of the wig either, because there&#x27;s just no hair to spare. The color is perfect, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as it&#x27;s just too thin to be acceptable.</li>
    <li> Awesome wig! Like the reviews say the bangs aren&#x27;t cut, but that&#x27;s fine. The color is perfect (I got the darker one like the reviews suggested) and it&#x27;s a really nice quality wig. I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing wig. Great value, shipped on-time... this was a perfect transaction for me.</li>
    <li> Wig color is perfect (light brown), length and style is dead on. Higher end quality wig for a great price.</li>
    <li> I got the light brown version according to my order but it seems to be more blonde than anything. the length is great and the colour actually works but the braid and overall amount of hair seem.. lacking. I was hoping the braid was much thicker but it&#x27;s barely a cm thick and I can see the under mesh where the braid starts. I am going to try another wig but keep this one for the colour - it has the best reviews so far for colour matching and I&#x27;m hoping I can style the wig and fix the braid issue</li>
    <li> Well to start with my review, I totally, definetely, absolutely, love the wig! I choose the light brown color, becuase is super perfect for the Asuna cosplay hair color tone. The bangs were longer but they&#x27;re super easy to trim, the lenght is perfect. The texture of the wig is so soft and it doesn&#x27;t tangle that easy, and if it does it fastly untangles with a normal brush! The Cf-fashion wig manufacture send a handwrite letter with agift, which I think it was super nice of them. Maria (cf-fashiong wig manufacture) you don&#x27;t have to worry, I totally loved the wig, the right condition and everything! Thanks for everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the shipping, the shipping price is ok! If I would&#x27;ve bought this wig in my country I would&#x27;ve payed like $40 bucks! + the car gas xD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways I would totally recomend this to any cosplayer who wants to rock out that Asuna costume!&lt;br /&gt;Best Wishes -Gabriela</li>
    <li> When I reading through the reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get the light brown or the peach one, it was hard to decide. In the end I ended up ordering the light brown one, I was hoping what everyone was saying about the light brown one was true. It came in literally a week, so it was super fast shipping! So anyways, when I first took the wig out of the package I was actually pretty upset with the color BUT it was just the lighting in my room. When I stepped into lighter places it looked beautiful and just like Asuna&#x27;s hair! It&#x27;s super soft, long, and doesn&#x27;t tangle. I&#x27;m really happy I ordered the light brown one, it&#x27;s totally perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only little con is it can sometimes be a little itchy but it&#x27;s not bad :)&lt;br /&gt;oh and it comes with a wig cap!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT****&lt;br /&gt;I added a picture of me with the wig in the image gallery so anyone who is wanting to buy this wig can see what it looks like in person! I hope it&#x27;s helpful to you! :)</li>
    <li> Wig is perfect, the color is beautiful and brings a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I chose the light brown and it was the perfect color. It was teased into the proper left handed part on top and the bangs needed to be trimmed to the right length, as they should be. I was concerned it wouldn&#x27;t come in time for the date I needed it for, and it came in a week and three days! It&#x27;s a wonderful wig, the seller is sweet and understanding, and I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cool and seems durable</li>
    <li> Good wig! It came well packaged with a little letter and some bonuses (will attach picture of how it was all packaged) I ordered the light brown one and it&#x27;s perfect! It does tangle and it ends under my waistline (I&#x27;m about 4&#x27;11&amp;#34;) so it is a little more difficult to keep it from not tangling when I sit etc. overall I&#x27;m very happy with this wig and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Wig circumference is smaller then a normal wig and I own a vast collection of wigs to know the difference... The hair is pretty thin as well, wish it was a lot thicker. It&#x27;s a one time use wig then trash it.</li>
