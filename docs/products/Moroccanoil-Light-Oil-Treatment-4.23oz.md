    <li> This product works well with my thinly textured hair.  I like the look that it gives to my hair and it conditions it.  Since I use such a small amount, it lasts a long time and I think it is a good value from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is now all the rage, but before all the \\&quot;new\\&quot; products there was Moroccan Oil.  This is a very reliable product that protects and inproves your hair.  It is easily absorbed without leaving that oily feel and look some products leave. If you have fine or thin hair I reccomend the light version.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used Moroccanoil Light for quite a while.  Ordering from Amazon frees me from trying to get to the salon before it closes.  Morroccanoil Light prevents frizz and adds shine.  It makes styling easier.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my hair, isn&#x27;t greasy or oily. I have fine curly blonde hair and this works perfectly to reduce dryness and frizz,</li>
    <li> I have very, very thin, naturally blonde hair. I&#x27;ve also colored my hair in the past. My hair gets tangled in the shower easily, and styling it used to zap it completely. Then this little beauty came along, and it&#x27;s nearly a miracle. My hair is always straight, but when I put a pump in my hand and spread it around my hair, my hair blows straight with zero frizz.

I apply 1 pump for long long hair and it hold through for hours.</li>
    <li> Been using product for some time and Will order again when run out.&lt;br /&gt;All Moroccan oil products are good.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo and conditioner especially</li>
    <li> co-worker got me this fo Christmas ever since that Christmas I purchase this for myself it does wonders fo your hair. It is worth that money you pay it lasts a long time and the results you get are remarkable</li>
    <li> This product is one that is worth it&#x27;s weight. It gives ultimate shine as well as moisturization to my dry hair.</li>
    <li> Ships quickly and&lt;br /&gt;Using this product was becoming good&lt;br /&gt;Discount price but more would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;Also want to buy in the following</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I will never use anything else again! Worth every penny! Moroccan oil is the best brand out there.</li>
    <li> I have thin curly hair that gets knotty and frizzy and gross when I put nothing in it. I found this product when I was going on a back-packing trip through SE Asia and was going to be without hot showers and mirrors at times and didn&#x27;t know what to do b/c I didn&#x27;t want to have to trek a bunch of product with me for the whole time. I asked a salesperson at a beauty store what to do and she suggested the moroccan oil. I thought it was awesome because you can carry a little bit and it will last a really long time. I was just hoping it worked but I decided to take the risk! It is awesome!!! You need the littlest bit and it just tames the frizz and keeps your hair shiny and manageable. A mini bottle lasted me over a month and it definitely made my hair much easier to deal with on my trip! Since then, I haven&#x27;t gone without it. It is great to use by itself when I don&#x27;t want to do anything to my hair or when I want to straighten it and it is also great before adding a curling product when I go curly. Also, I absolutely love the smell. I have tried both the light and the regular. I think the light is better for thin hair.</li>
