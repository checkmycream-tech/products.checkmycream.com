      <li>Love the way my hair feels</li>
      <li>ok, I just don&#x27;t like the way it smells,  at all.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.</li>
      <li>DHS revitalized it and moisturized the hair so that it was shinny and healthy feeling</li>
      <li>Many &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products have masking fragrances.</li>
      <li>VERY NICE AND REALLY WORKS</li>
      <li>It works great with the clear shampoo.</li>
      <li>Great for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>however I discovered the magik botanicals fragrance free conditioner and fell in love.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, arrived before expected.</li>
      <li>Very mild and does not irritate those scalp plaques.</li>
      <li>It gets rid of sebbohric dermatitis very quickly.</li>
      <li>I strongly urge the packers to tape the caps before shipping.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair in good condition and left a nice shine to it.</li>
      <li>I used to slather it on and rinse it off, but would have a ton of tangles in my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It does nothing to soften, smooth, or enhance the hair; it basically just gums it up a bit.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a fragrance free conditioner because of allergies and sensitivities.  </li>
      <li>This is too light... didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
      <li>Product arrived on time and as detailed on site.</li>
      <li>a good conditioner- leaves hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>Since we can use DHS shampoo without a problem, I was excited to try the rinse.  </li>
      <li>Great Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Softens and gets rid of the dry look...</li>
      <li>The best combination so far has been with DHS SAL Shampoo, and Cleure Deep Hair Conditioner.</li>
      <li>And Amazon usually has the best price and delivers quickly.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>I tried many kinds of shampoos and conditioners for my problem and none of them really helped.  </li>
      <li>For people looking for real free/clear stuff I have since had luck with the Desert Essence fragrance free shampoo/conditioner.</li>
      <li>Smells fresh.</li>
      <li>It also leaves your hair feeling silky fresh.</li>
      <li>This is the only conditioner that does not leave my hair feeling at all greasy considering I have very fine hair.</li>
      <li>Great product and will definitely purchase from this seller in future.  </li>
      <li>very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I could never find this in my local pharmacies and glad I found it here.</li>
      <li>Works great and no one knows it is a basic (not professional) conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I bought this along with it the first time.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t like it as much as Free and Clear Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>She said that another patient used it after hot yoga.  </li>
      <li>B000052XYQ DHS Clear Shampoo, Fragrance Free - 8 fl oz]]).</li>
      <li>the DHS conditioner smooths the frizz leaving my hair full and soft.</li>
      <li>My scalp condition is now vastly improved and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>Does absolutely nothing to condition my hair.</li>
      <li>Husband has very irritable scalp, and this product along with the shampoo seems to keep it under control.  </li>
      <li>I really like the DHS shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>This Rinse goes very well with the DHS Shampoo.  </li>
      <li>thought I&#x27;d save money by buying a cheaper fragrance-free conditioner at Whole Foods, but</li>
      <li>It pairs really well with the Zinc shampoo.</li>
      <li>Also noticed that there are fewer ingredients than many other brands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this product for many years because I have allergies to the preservatives found in almost all other cream rinses.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than other rinsed.</li>
      <li>: It works much better than regular shampoo in reducing oils and itchy scalps, but it is not a prescription one, if your problem is severe you should definitely seek assistance of a dermatologist.</li>
      <li>the very first time I washed my hair with this, I could still be on two days later without a itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>this product may not be for you if you want a high perfume conditioner.</li>
      <li>done enough if you have super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Newly diagnosed with allergies to fragrances this product lines was dermatologist approved.</li>
      <li>I also find I have to use more of it to get the same results as other conditioners, which makes the price per use high.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I&#x27;m highly chemically sensitive and couldn&#x27;t use this product because it still has a chemical smell.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair very soft, no tangles,and holds body quite well.</li>
      <li>One thing I like about the DHS products is the relatively short list of ingredients, compared to many other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
      <li>We aren&#x27;t able to usually use conditioner as it makes our scalps and skin break out.  </li>
      <li>It does have an odor as others have said, but more importantly, the DHS conditioner actually made my skin condition worse.  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>now wash my hair every other day, and I have noticed it is producing more oil than it was in the first few times I washed it, but it&#x27;s not itchy or flaky, which is the results I was hoping to get from this product.&lt;br /&gt;Together</li>
      <li>Hair feels clean and not weighted down from conditioning.</li>
      <li>For thinning hair this conditioning rinse is used in conjunction with DHS Clear Shampoo.  </li>
      <li>She also uses the clear shampoo, and the moisturizing lotion (DML).  </li>
      <li>Have used for several years and is really helping this old lady&#x27;s head of hair.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I both have sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I will continue to use it with the shampoo but wish it had a fragrance to it but will still use it also it doesn&#x27;t help with the tangles like regular conditioner has</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis.  I use this company&#x27;s shampoo and am happy with it.  So, I tried the conditioner.  It does have an odor as others have said, but more importantly, the DHS conditioner actually made my skin condition worse.  Not a pleasant experiece...</li>
    <li> Does nothing for my dandruff.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very good and help with styling. I wish the bottle was the same size as shampoo.</li>
    <li> I buy the DHS fragrance-free shampoo and love it ([[ASIN:B000052XYQ DHS Clear Shampoo, Fragrance Free - 8 fl oz]]). I bought this along with it the first time. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m highly chemically sensitive and couldn&#x27;t use this product because it still has a chemical smell. The shampoo has no discernible smell to me.</li>
    <li> I strongly urge the packers to tape the caps before shipping. Two leaked in this order &amp; made quite a mess.</li>
    <li> If you have scalp psoriasis this is the product you need.  Very mild and does not irritate those scalp plaques.</li>
    <li> Been using for several years- pricey but a good conditioner- leaves hair soft and manageable.  Love the way my hair feels</li>
    <li> I do like this product, the conditioner only.</li>
    <li> Dermotologist recommended use of this product.  Much less expensive from this seller than in pharmacy.  Great product and will definitely purchase from this seller in future.  Product arrived on time and as detailed on site.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for many years because I have allergies to the preservatives found in almost all other cream rinses.  It does an excellent job of keeping my hair soft and manageable.  And Amazon usually has the best price and delivers quickly.</li>
    <li> the only shampoo that worked for me</li>
    <li> I have a lot of allergies and cannot use fragranced products.  This does have a slight citrus scent, which is very subtle, but nice.  You MUST leave the conditioner in your hair for a few minutes to have it work.  I used to slather it on and rinse it off, but would have a ton of tangles in my fine hair.  Now I put it in, twist it up on top of my head, wash, and then rinse it out.  Works great and no one knows it is a basic (not professional) conditioner.  I will continue to purchase this product and recommend it to anyone with sensitivities.</li>
    <li> Great product, recommended by our Dermatologist for our 10 yo daughter&#x27;s eczema.  She also uses the clear shampoo, and the moisturizing lotion (DML).  It doesn&#x27;t sting and there are no perfumes.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble for a long time with a very dry scalp and white flaking patches--more than just ordinary dandruff.  I tried many kinds of shampoos and conditioners for my problem and none of them really helped.  This product does.  I use both the shampoo and the conditioner and it definitely controls my condition.  As long as I shampoo at least every other day, I don&#x27;t have to put up with dandruff any more.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! I would recommend getting the shampoo too! Makes your hair very soft, no tangles,and holds body quite well.</li>
    <li> Great product paired with the dhs w/zinc shampoo.</li>
    <li> It smells awful! Like plastic. It doesn&#x27;t work any better than other rinsed. Maybe it was just the bottle I had.</li>
    <li> Needed a conditioner with no smell and this one fits the criteria.  It also leaves your hair feeling silky fresh.</li>
    <li> I really like the DHS shampoo and conditioner.  Also noticed that there are fewer ingredients than many other brands.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it as much as Free and Clear Conditioner.  Like other reviewers, the smell and feel wasn&#x27;t right.  I also bought a bottle of DHS shampoo to try and will see what happens when I run out of current F &amp; C shampoo.</li>
    <li> Newly diagnosed with allergies to fragrances this product lines was dermatologist approved. It became apparent at the first use that this rinse did little to detangle my wet hair, or smooth my shoulder-length hair when dry. Might be OK for hair a few inches long. The best combination so far has been with DHS SAL Shampoo, and Cleure Deep Hair Conditioner.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE AND REALLY WORKS</li>
    <li> Unscented is essential in my household.  It is very difficult to find products that are truly fragrance free. Many &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products have masking fragrances.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner that does not leave my hair feeling at all greasy considering I have very fine hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have sensitive skin.  We aren&#x27;t able to usually use conditioner as it makes our scalps and skin break out.  Since we can use DHS shampoo without a problem, I was excited to try the rinse.  It does nothing to soften, smooth, or enhance the hair; it basically just gums it up a bit. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a fragrance free conditioner because of allergies and sensitivities.  This was &amp;#34;dermatologist recommended&amp;#34; and had good reviews so I bought it.  Turns out it has artificial dyes/colors.  If you are trying to avoid fragrance, you probably don&#x27;t want YELLOW #6 either.&lt;br /&gt;So I just don&#x27;t get why the company added it?  This may not be an issue for everyone, but it is for me.&lt;br /&gt;I feel I wasted my money and got an itchy head.&lt;br /&gt;note- For people looking for real free/clear stuff I have since had luck with the Desert Essence fragrance free shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> This Rinse goes very well with the DHS Shampoo.  I like the way it leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> The product does ease itchy scalp, but I didn&#x27;t like the feeling of my hair after using it.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my irritated scalp !!!</li>
    <li> The conditioner is OK. It leaves my hair without tangles but not as soft and shiny as other conditioners. I also find I have to use more of it to get the same results as other conditioners, which makes the price per use high.</li>
    <li> Just average conditioner.  Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing to condition my hair.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  I began to get little pimple-like bumps after sweating during workouts.  She said that another patient used it after hot yoga.  It gets rid of sebbohric dermatitis very quickly.</li>
    <li> Received a sample from my Dermatologist and liked it so decided to get this. Love the way my scalp and hair feel after washing with this product. If you have itchy and sensitive scalp I would say try it.</li>
    <li> After 25 years of trying all sorts of shampoos and topical meds for itchy scaling, a dermatologist diagnosed psoriasis and recommended DHS Clear Shampoo and DHS Conditioning Rinse. Wow! Who knew my scalp was so sensitive to the fragrances and other chemicals in regular shampoo and conditioner? My scalp condition is now vastly improved and easy to manage. I use DHS&#x27;s fragrance-free tar shampoo a couple times a week to help control the symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d save money by buying a cheaper fragrance-free conditioner at Whole Foods, but using it even one time makes my scalp break out. Same with any other shampoo. Okay! I learned my lesson and I&#x27;m sticking with these DHS products.</li>
    <li> Very good for my husband&#x27;s scalp.</li>
    <li> Works ok, I just don&#x27;t like the way it smells,  at all.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders!</li>
    <li> Samples of this rinse were provided by the vendor to my dermatologist and I got several and subsew\quently ordered 3 bottles.  I have problems with chemical reactions that make my hair feel like it was at the breaking point.  DHS revitalized it and moisturized the hair so that it was shinny and healthy feeling I really love this product. Few other conditioners/rinses can so quickly revitalize damaged hair.</li>
    <li> It does the job.  I use it with DHS shampoo.  One thing I like about the DHS products is the relatively short list of ingredients, compared to many other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> I could never find this in my local pharmacies and glad I found it here. Now I can look forward to ordering more.</li>
    <li> This rinse is one of the best I have used. Leaves my hair in good condition and left a nice shine to it.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Softens and gets rid of the dry look...</li>
    <li> No perfume smell or irritant to scalp. Hair feels clean and not weighted down from conditioning. Very happy with this product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells fresh.</li>
    <li> I had a severe allergic reaction that started on my ears and neck, so my derm switched me to this product.  It will not leave your hair luxurious and knot-free but it serves the purpose and gets the job done enough if you have super sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is too light... didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I also found the shampoo terrible... left my hair dry. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Husband has very irritable scalp, and this product along with the shampoo seems to keep it under control.  Would recommend for anyone with skin/scalp problems</li>
    <li> For thinning hair this conditioning rinse is used in conjunction with DHS Clear Shampoo.  Have used for several years and is really helping this old lady&#x27;s head of hair.</li>
    <li> I had a problem with an itchy scalp for months and tried everything.  I finally went to a Dermatologist who recommended this line of products.  Using this with the same brand shampoo has cured my scalp itching.  The only drawback is I usually use Vitamin E or another conditioner on my ends.</li>
    <li> No scent at all and does a good job taming hair.</li>
    <li> Great Seller!!! Everything went perfect!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this small DHS Shampoo to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is excessive oily, which that lead it to be flaky, itchy and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a month since I bought it and the amount of oil my scalp produced was drastically reduced.&lt;br /&gt;In the very first time I washed my hair with this, I could still be on two days later without a itchy scalp. Before it, I could barely make 24h without having to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I now wash my hair every other day, and I have noticed it is producing more oil than it was in the first few times I washed it, but it&#x27;s not itchy or flaky, which is the results I was hoping to get from this product.&lt;br /&gt;Together with the shampoo, I am also using the recommended conditioner from the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short: It works much better than regular shampoo in reducing oils and itchy scalps, but it is not a prescription one, if your problem is severe you should definitely seek assistance of a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a Dermatologist as a hair conditioner because of my allergies to fragrance and color. After removing the cellophane wrapping, I was surprised that it did have color (peachy/orange--which I am allergic to) and I also detected a very faint fragrance.  I tried it only once, and it really didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair and made my scalp itchy.  I consider this product a waste of money and would have returned it if I had not removed the cellophane wrapping.</li>
    <li> Works really well for anyone with dermatitis on their scalp BUT runs out very fast and a bit expensive for the size.</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner I use with the exception of Clynol Luminous Oil Shimmer Treatment (used only only when I color my hair.)  DHS does not make my hair soft or frizzy like other conditioners which are like fabric softener and give me the same effect.  I have short curly baby fine, multi-racial hair, in other words a total nightmare. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHS conditioner for years since a Dermatologist recommend it, I love it!  Great for people with sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, leaves it soft and shiny.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product, wish it came in a larger size and was less expensive. It does work very well for us with dry scalp or psoriasis though.</li>
    <li> This is a bare-bones conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any extra thickeners, colors, or fragrances. It&#x27;s an unexpected consistency, a strange yellow color, and smells vaguely of plastic. But after the initial break in, I think my sensitive scalp really appreciates my using a simple product. I have noticed a lot less itching and redness than when I used to use Herbal Essences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I have curly hair, and sometimes my hair gets frizzy. This seems to happen more often when I use this conditioner. But I dont think I should fault the conditioner for it. Instead, I&#x27;ve just been using a very small amount of product to get the frizz out and a little bit of cologne to give my hair a nicer fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m happy with DHS and think I&#x27;ll continue to use their products.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve been bothered with zits on my scalp.  The shampoo and rinse has fixed my problem with this.  Zinc seems to be a great help.</li>
    <li> Limited to hair condition due to fragrance allergy however would recommend fragrance free magik botanicals hair conditioner instead of this one.  Felt this hair conditioner by DHS left my hair feeling dry not as silky as previous other fragrant filled hair conditioners that I use on my hair. This brand of conditioner left my hair feeling dry however I discovered the magik botanicals fragrance free conditioner and fell in love.</li>
    <li> This conditioning rinse leaves my hair soft and fuller, I have been using it after the DHS Zinc shampoo which is soothing/healing to my red and itchy scalp but it leaves my hair frizzy, so the DHS conditioner smooths the frizz leaving my hair full and soft. I am very pleased with the results of this two products</li>
    <li> Packaging is all the same... I ordered the wrong product and now am stuck with something I didn&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, arrived before expected. very fast shipping. product was as described..</li>
    <li> Love this conditioning rinse. I have extremely sensitive skin and I have psoriasis so I have to be careful what I use on my scalp. I have been using this for years and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I would recommend this to anyone that has sensitivities. It works great with the clear shampoo. this product may not be for you if you want a high perfume conditioner. But if you need a little softness without upsetting your skin this will work.</li>
    <li> DIsn&#x27;t work for my mom</li>
    <li> I purchased the DHS Zinc Shampoo and figured I would need a conditioner, so why not choose this. I&#x27;ve been following the instructions on the bottle, and wow. This really has improved the texture of my hair, and it seems to make it less oily. I have not had any reverse reactions to this conditioner at all. It pairs really well with the Zinc shampoo. I would highly recommend.</li>
