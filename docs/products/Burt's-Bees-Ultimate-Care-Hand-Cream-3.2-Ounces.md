### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>this lotion is great!</li>
      <li>best hand cream I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Love this!!!!</li>
      <li>Unlike their hand repair cream- the smell is pleasant to non-existant.</li>
      <li>so I had no idea what a good price was.</li>
      <li>Good hand cream.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream because it&#x27;s much more pleasant to use.</li>
      <li>This is SO nice.</li>
      <li>oh so nice.  </li>
      <li>I really liked this</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t share it, make them buy their own :)</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves my hands and arms feeling good.  </li>
      <li>My hands look and feel better.</li>
      <li>and I love how my hands feel and look after applying it.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees products are top notch.</li>
      <li>I love this hand cream</li>
      <li>I love that Burt&#x27;s Bees items are all anti-animal testing as well.</li>
      <li>I really love this formula.  </li>
      <li>So smooth with a very mild, clean, pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Lol and just so folks know, my friends and family say that I am OCD and totally well, um, anal about this kind of stuff.  </li>
      <li>Happy with it so far.</li>
      <li>I have tried many hand creams, most being natural hand creams, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Easily a 5 star product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been one that really liked hand cream, but this one is really light, smells fresh and not too perfumy and it really works!  </li>
      <li>you like a nice, strong (but natural) fragrance to your lotions</li>
      <li>This is the first hand cream that has worked for me, and I have tried many.  </li>
      <li>cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: ultra-moisturizing, absorbs quickly, non-greasy, no added fragrance, and paraben free.  </li>
      <li>The cream is really good for my hands even though I have an eczema problem, but I did have a big issue with the tube.</li>
      <li>I would tell anyone to purchase this very rich just quick absorbing hand cream.  </li>
      <li>Still looking for a brand that is good quality natural products at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m pregnant and scented products have been bothering me, but I don&#x27;t notice this unless I sniff my hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are fantastic and very moisturizing, but while I do love their fragrances, it can be a bit much at times.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s usually pretty pricey!</li>
      <li>It makes my hands feel great, it rubs right in, it isn&#x27;t greasy, it has a nice consistency, thick but not hard.</li>
      <li>I love the natural ingredients too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
      <li>My kitty that sleeps in the bed with my husband and me at night won&#x27;t go near the bed if she even suspects that I&#x27;ve applied any Pacifica creams or body butters.  : )</li>
      <li>So far, this is my favorite that I can take in my bag on a plane.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky with my hand creams, and can&#x27;t use creams that don&#x27;t absorb quickly or feel sticky on my fingers.  </li>
      <li>I understand that it&#x27;s all natural, and that&#x27;s great since I&#x27;ve been trying to only buy natural products, but they still have to be affordable.</li>
      <li>and my hands get pretty beat up...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind the price in comparison  to other hand lotions I tried that ended up not being effective.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and has helped heal my cracked, painful, eczema-ridden winter hands, all while having a super light, pleasant, natural smell - nothing like the strong herbal smell and greasiness of Burt&#x27;s shea butter hand</li>
      <li>This absorbs nicely and my hands still feel soft and moisturized, even after washing my hands multiple times throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe my hands, which felt like velcro a couple of days ago, are now super soft and smooth!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is very soothing and long-lasting.</li>
      <li>It works better than any other and you can use it all day with no greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>It did not absorb quickly but there are other hand lotions that absorb super fast</li>
      <li>this makes them feel like new !</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend Pacifica&#x27;s scented hand creams.  </li>
      <li>I stay away from petroleum products, parabens, phthalates, and even strong-smelling natural oils in hand creams can be overpowering at times.  </li>
      <li>It is not greasy at all and really does last all day.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty good, too bad</li>
      <li>I tried a whole bunch of different kinds that came in tubes smaller than 3.4 oz.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had dry skin (mostly the backs of hands) for the past year, probably due to washing my hands too much, and nothing has helped.  </li>
      <li>Too expensive, but it is really nice.</li>
      <li>Much better than the shea butter hand cream from Burts (which has such a strong horrible herbal smell that I found it absolutely unbearable).  </li>
      <li>A little goes a long way for me, so I find it totally worth</li>

<li> Not a strong scent either.</li>
<li> : as others before me have pointed out, the obvious issue is that it&#x27;s expensive for a small tube.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick but isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
<li> This is unscented, however it does have a subtle scent from the ingredients, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all</li>
<li> A bit expensive for the small size, but would buy again.</li>
<li> It is also SO expensive.</li>
<li> But it is very expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Way over priced! My wife asked me to order it for her so I had no idea what a good price was. I then saw it in Walmart and it was a lot less. So I learned lesson.</li>
    <li> Easily a 5 star product.  I have tried many hand creams, most being natural hand creams, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.  I stay away from petroleum products, parabens, phthalates, and even strong-smelling natural oils in hand creams can be overpowering at times.  This is the only hand cream I&#x27;ve found that covers everything I want, including coconut oil, without leaving a slimy, greasy feel to my hands or an obvious scent.  It absorbs quickly and has helped heal my cracked, painful, eczema-ridden winter hands, all while having a super light, pleasant, natural smell - nothing like the strong herbal smell and greasiness of Burt&#x27;s shea butter hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: ultra-moisturizing, absorbs quickly, non-greasy, no added fragrance, and paraben free.  I can&#x27;t believe my hands, which felt like velcro a couple of days ago, are now super soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: as others before me have pointed out, the obvious issue is that it&#x27;s expensive for a small tube.  A little goes a long way for me, so I find it totally worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like a nice, strong (but natural) fragrance to your lotions, I highly recommend Pacifica&#x27;s scented hand creams.  They are fantastic and very moisturizing, but while I do love their fragrances, it can be a bit much at times.  My kitty that sleeps in the bed with my husband and me at night won&#x27;t go near the bed if she even suspects that I&#x27;ve applied any Pacifica creams or body butters.  : )</li>
    <li> I really liked this and I love how my hands feel and look after applying it. I don&#x27;t mind the price in comparison  to other hand lotions I tried that ended up not being effective. I love the natural ingredients too. What did not work for me was how greasy it was. It did not absorb quickly but there are other hand lotions that absorb super fast and I can use on the go which is what I was looking for. I would use this before bed.</li>
    <li> This is the first hand cream that has worked for me, and I have tried many.  I&#x27;ve had dry skin (mostly the backs of hands) for the past year, probably due to washing my hands too much, and nothing has helped.  I&#x27;m very picky with my hand creams, and can&#x27;t use creams that don&#x27;t absorb quickly or feel sticky on my fingers.

This is unscented, however it does have a subtle scent from the ingredients, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all (I&#x27;m pregnant and scented products have been bothering me, but I don&#x27;t notice this unless I sniff my hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin around my fingers usually cracks in the winter, so I&#x27;m interested to see how this holds up.</li>
    <li> My hands are extremely dry - cracked and parched.  This product is very soothing and long-lasting.I would recommend it to everyone with similar problem.</li>
    <li> I really love this formula.  It is not greasy at all and really does last all day.</li>
    <li> Good hand cream. It&#x27;s thick but isn&#x27;t oily. I was looking for something like this! Not a strong scent either. I love that Burt&#x27;s Bees items are all anti-animal testing as well. A bit expensive for the small size, but would buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream and I think they are discontinuing it because I am having trouble finding it. It works better than any other and you can use it all day with no greasy feeling. My finger tips crack in the winter and this has taken care of the problem. Unlike their hand repair cream- the smell is pleasant to non-existant. Love this!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one that really liked hand cream, but this one is really light, smells fresh and not too perfumy and it really works!  My hands look and feel better.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves my hands and arms feeling good.  Due to illness and meds that are necessary for me to take, my once soft unblemished skin is horrible with scars from needles etc etc.  I would tell anyone to purchase this very rich just quick absorbing hand cream.  Lol and just so folks know, my friends and family say that I am OCD and totally well, um, anal about this kind of stuff.  No offense intended with that word.</li>
    <li> This is SO nice. It is also SO expensive. It makes my hands feel great, it rubs right in, it isn&#x27;t greasy, it has a nice consistency, thick but not hard. I love it! And I like the thought of Baobab oil - from the &amp;#34;Tree of Life&amp;#34;. But it is very expensive. Too expensive, but it is really nice.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not thrilled about the price, this cream is worth it.  It&#x27;s not greasy, it has staying power and it feels oh so nice.  A hand cream to be hidden and cherished by those who need it.  Don&#x27;t share it, make them buy their own :)</li>
    <li> The product was just what I thought what I was getting.  Happy with it so far. Burt&#x27;s Bees products are top notch.</li>
    <li> The only stuff that works on my hands! Tried the hand salve, too oily.  This stuff is pretty good, too bad it&#x27;s usually pretty pricey! I drive a tow truck for a living and my hands get pretty beat up... this makes them feel like new !</li>
    <li> Much better than the shea butter hand cream from Burts (which has such a strong horrible herbal smell that I found it absolutely unbearable).  So I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream because it&#x27;s much more pleasant to use. I do think that it&#x27;s a bit overpriced though, especially for such a small little tube. I understand that it&#x27;s all natural, and that&#x27;s great since I&#x27;ve been trying to only buy natural products, but they still have to be affordable. Still looking for a brand that is good quality natural products at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The cream is really good for my hands even though I have an eczema problem, but I did have a big issue with the tube. When I tried to read the information on the back it hurt my eyes. Somehow, a combination of the way it was printed and the material the tube is made of, has created an eye health problem.</li>
    <li> My regular hand-cream is L&#x27;Occitane en Provence Shea Butter Hand Cream, $30 for 5oz.  Looking for a similar quality, but in a travel-size.  I refuse to spend $12 for 1 oz of L&#x27;Occitane.  (Hey, we all draw a line somewhere.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I checked TSA for allowable sizes, found that limit for a hand-cream in your backpack or purse is 3.4 oz: &amp;#34;Liquids, gels, aerosols, creams and pastes must be 3.4 ounces (100ml) or less per container.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried a whole bunch of different kinds that came in tubes smaller than 3.4 oz.  This was the priciest, 11.5 at Walmart for 3.2 Oz.  So far, this is my favorite that I can take in my bag on a plane.  It&#x27;s worth a try.  Walmart sells it for $3 cheaper than Amazon, but they typically only have one tube of it at a time.</li>
    <li> best hand cream I&#x27;ve used.  soothed and healed my itchy cracked dry skin.  I wash my hands a lot being a mommy of three and get really dry skin this lotion is great!</li>
    <li> The only thing I can use on my hands that isn&#x27;t greasy and actually works.  So smooth with a very mild, clean, pleasant smell.</li>
