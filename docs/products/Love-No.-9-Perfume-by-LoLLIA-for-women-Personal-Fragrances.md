    <li> Awesome product. Awesome transaction.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Lollia hand creams, so I decided to try the parfum and I&#x27;m very disappointed.  The smell is wonderful, but 30 minutes after you put it on the smell is completely gone.  Stick with the hand creams, the spray scents are a bust!</li>
    <li> Love the scent- only wish it lasted longer on my skin!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to everyone who wants to impress the ladies, make them smell good and feel happy. Smells great</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Lollia In Love smells so lovely and you can&#x27;t beat the price! I use it for every day wear because the scent is fresh, clean and romantic. I always get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> YUM! Such a nice crisp clean smell!</li>
    <li> Smells very crisp and unique, Like a bubbly champagne. Definitely recommend this for 18-40 year olds. very fresh. My boyfriend loves this perfume whenever I wear it! GREAT perfume! Definitely buy the lotion too. I love it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume because of all the positive reviews on the Internet, but I think after smelling the fragrance in person, I would say this fragrance is too sweet even for a 20-something-year-old. I really want to love this product, but unfortunately, this will not be the go-to perfume for me. On the side note, the fragrance fated very fast. It only lasted a couple hours.</li>
    <li> I love it! Perfect spring /summer scent!! Its light and perfect for day or night!! I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite scent. Light and fresh.</li>
    <li> Great price, love the scent.  Clean and sweet without being cloying.</li>
    <li> light perfume for your every day... love it!</li>
    <li> This is my go-to, signature scent. It&#x27;s fresh, simple, lightly sweet, floral without being too flowery or overly prissy. Three years and counting and I&#x27;m still not sick of it. It&#x27;s not the kind of parfum that people won&#x27;t crinkle their nose about; it&#x27;s subtle, feminine, classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of of the soft scent of actual flower petals. If you ever enjoyed rubbing flower petals on your wrists as a child, this scent will probably please you very much.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume,  ironically and appropriately named &amp;#34;In Love&amp;#34;. I found it while window shopping and decided to order through Amazon(they&#x27;re always cheaper!). It&#x27;s perfect for summer. It&#x27;s light, not overbearing. It&#x27;s a floral scent which I absolutely love. It&#x27;s rose and something else that I can&#x27;t quite discern but it&#x27;s great.</li>
