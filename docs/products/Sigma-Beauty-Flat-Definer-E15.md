<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This works fantastic for tightlining, gel lining, and adding definition with powdered shadows as well.  I have MAC brushes as well as Sigmas, and frankly, these do the job just as well (if not better) for half the price. Brush is well-made, bristles are soft enough to not poke/itch but firm enough to do clean work. No shed!  I have two, love them.</li>
    <li> Great for sculpting the eyebrows</li>
    <li> Great defining brush.  I use if for my eyebrows and it works great!</li>
    <li> Perfect for eyes, great seller</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for tight lining!</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat brush, which was priced well in comparison to others available on the market, and it arrived quickly and it is fantastic.  My only suggestion would be a better sleeve to keep the brush in - the one it came with is not reusable, and I would love to be able to better protect my new brush.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the fast shipment and quality of Sigma&#x27;s product(s). I will continue to shop with Sigma Beauty in the future.</li>
    <li> Great brush for tight lining. Easy on the eyes and is small enough to make a very thin line! Excited</li>
    <li> Defines eyes beautifully!!!</li>
    <li> This is actually my second of these brushes, that&#x27;s how amazing they are!&lt;br /&gt;I keep one for filling in my eyebrows and one for eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;This brush is also great for doing anything on your bottom lash line&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> dense, stuff and precise square edged brush for application of shadow to the lash lines. can be used to &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; dark shadow into the lashes for a more natural liner look or to darken the lash lines (mostly the top) or to smoke out pencil liner or set it with shadow. it does these jobs very well.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I use it to apply gel liner to my lids and lower lash line and it creates such a smooth and straight line. I have always had trouble with applying eyeliner but problem has since been resolved since purchasing this brush. I can do it so effortlessly it has me asking myself &amp;#34;Where have you been all my makeup life?&amp;#34; An awesome addition to your makeup collection.</li>
    <li> the brushes are cool but i could of just bought an entire brush kit which i did that had the same brushes in it and work the same. dont spend 14 bucks on a brush when you can spend 20-30 for a entire large bag of brushes that work just as good. i wish someone would of told me this. youtube people got me locked into this one sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;Above is my recent review and i must say i had to move my review down to one star.After using this concealer brush for maybe two months the hairs are starting to fall out and  the hairs are starting to separate making it close to impossible to use this brush for my eyebrows. This is a major disappointment and i would take into consideration that do to the weak hairs on this brush it wouldn&#x27;t be best to use for eyebrows after awhile .</li>
    <li> this is a great brush to achieve the tight lining look. it is easy to use and i am not a makeup expert.</li>
    <li> Love it.....Quick Delivery!</li>
    <li> Love. This. Brush.  For underneath the eye.  Sigma is good brand.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush at the recommendation of a friend. It was a great price compared to other brushes by MAC or Laura Mercier. The bristles are just the right stiffness for tightlining your eyes. I usually wet it just a tad before dipping in my liner and it works wonderfully. I haven&#x27;t had to clean it yet but Sigma included detailed instructions on how to take care of it. Would definitely recommend this and I will be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future!</li>
    <li> GREAT IF YOU USE GEL EYELINER IT IS A  MUST HAVE</li>
    <li> So upset this brush ended up being fake. The picture is not accurate at all. You can feel it in the weight. I compared it to my actual real ones I have from the actual sigma store. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> love it i really do ,my gel liner glides with this brush with a perfect line will purchase more of these brushes thank you for great service and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I saw this brush being used on a YouTube video for applying Laura Mercier Cake Eye Liner, so I thought I&#x27;d purchase this brush ... and cake eye liner ... and give them both a try.  And I&#x27;m glad I did.  I LOVE APPLYING CAKE EYE LINER NOW - my eyes pop.  The brush tip is stiff and applies the liner perfectly to my eyes.  Would recommend to anyone interested in purchased.  Shipped quickly and packaged in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Exactly  what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This was bought for a gift and the recipient loved it. The product itself is perfectly manufactured and the use was easy and gives great results. Can&#x27;t be more specific as I am not the one who uses it, but my friend recommends it fully.</li>
    <li> I have a flat definer brush from MAC, and this one by Sigma is far better and is cheaper.  I can&#x27;t wait to try more Sigma brushes; I want to transfer all of my MAC brushes to Sigma.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush perfect for eyeliner and putting shadow over pencil liner, it gives straight precise lines. Definely a must for anyone.</li>
    <li> I am using this brush to fill in my eyebrows and it is amazing! The brush was delivered very fast and in a perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Works great! Easy to handle!  In my opinion, it works as well or better than the more expensive ones. I will be buying more to give as gifts.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I have gone my adult life applying eye makeup without this brush! Creates smooth, sleek lines and/or helps you &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; shadow to line upper or lower lids. A must have for eye makeup application.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush because my MAC 212 was getting pretty beat up. The fact that MAC asks $24 for their version of this simple brush is brutal and since I&#x27;ve been really pleased with Sigma&#x27;s E37 and E38 brushes in the past, I had high hopes for the Sigma E15. Sadly, I was pretty disappointed with this particular brush...the bristles are not quite firm enough, although it does appear to be a quality well made brush, In my experience, Flat definers should only have enough give/bend to provide comfort when used. Personally, I use it as a brow brush and for an occasional liner brush, although I have other brushes I generally prefer for lining my eyes. This brush has too much give, it bends when I need it to stay precise like the MAC brush has always done so beautifully well. Although this Sigma E15 brush is a full $11 cheaper than the MAC 212 brush, $12,50 is a lot of money to spend just to find out it isn&#x27;t the brush you were hoping for.</li>
    <li> Use it often! It defines the outside of my eyebrows with concealer perfectly! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  You have always provided the best service, speedy and the product is always what you state it will be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting a straight line when using an skinny eyeliner brush so was very happy to receive this one because that&#x27;s no longer a problem. I don&#x27;t even have to try that hard, the way this flat brush is shaped, it just lends itself to making a subtle yet defined line. I bought it to use with Laura Mercier tightline eyeliner and I have to say, it&#x27;s about the best brush in my collection.</li>
    <li> this brush is useful when I create Korean  style (thick+straight) eyebrow.</li>
    <li> Does the job perfectly</li>
    <li> I love Sigma brushes and own quite a few. They last a long time and still look good even after being cleaned multiple times. I dip it in brow gel and use this brush to get a good straight arch on my eyebrows. This brush helps you get a clean brow and its hard to mess up when using it. You can also apply concealer to it and then use it to clean up around the brow if you werent so neat with your brow pencil.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite brushes. The bristles are short and dense and it applies just the right amount of color exactly where I need it. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing Sigma brushes in the very near future!</li>
    <li> Sigma Brushes are amazing.  I just added the E15 to my growing collection.  I use it to diffuse pencil eyeliner.  Sigma Brushes never fail to give excellent makeup application.  Etailz is a reputable seller--great products, good packaging, and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> This brush is great and very affordable. It is just like the mac brush but cheaper i really love it</li>
    <li> I use it everyday to apply cake eye liner. Love it! Best brush I have used to apply this type of makeup.</li>
    <li> Great for lower lash line</li>
    <li> Love! Perfect for applying shadow on the lower lid!</li>
    <li> I will have to say, I really do like this brush. But, I am still learning to work with it. I&#x27;ve tried using it for various applications &amp; it does a great job delivering the product, but, I haven&#x27;t found the best way, for me - yet. I find it to be a little to &amp;#34;broad&amp;#34; &amp; might need a narrower brush.</li>
    <li> So I have tried a couple of flat edge liner brushes and by far I think this has been the best!! The sephora ones are way too scratchy and I was not really Impressed with EcoTools either. The Bare Minerals brush head is way to big but this is just perfect! The bristles are super soft and it really is amazing for tight lining as it doesn&#x27;t poke the heck out of your eyeball. I am already thinking of getting another one! But the price went up by 50&#x27;cents in like 2 days haha. But this is worth the price and actually the price is really not bad at all. The brush also has a really nice weight to it as well! It&#x27;s not flimsy but it is really sturdy!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY don&#x27;t know how I lived without this brush. :) Its amazing for pressing shadow onto the lower lash line and then blending it out with a pencil brush. LOVE love love, and the shipping was extremely fast so I was really impressed.</li>
    <li> Best little brush for undereye color! Picks up pigment and colors beautifully and puts it right where you want it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush, good price, arrived quickly!  :)</li>
    <li> I recently started tightlining my eyes. I love this brush because it is firm enough to make a great strong line without irritating the sensitive parts of my waterline.</li>
    <li> amazing brush...i simply love it...sigma got some awesome brushes..</li>
    <li> just what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;great for eye liner&lt;br /&gt;this has been a hard to find product&lt;br /&gt;this definitely does not disappoint</li>
    <li> The brushes came alot sooner then the estimated arrival date..the quality of the brushes can be equally compared to mac brushes.</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes have always been my goto brushes. They always have new line-ups. Never cease to amaze me. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I got my Sigma flat definer-E15 brush on the mail today...and I run to try it  applying the cake eye liner...and the results were simply amazing!, I&#x27;m so happy that I finally got this brush.</li>
    <li> I have been watching youtube videos and I learned about tightlining. I&#x27;ve also heard so many good things about sigma brushes, so I thought it would be perfect. I love it! I&#x27;ve had so much fun using this brush! I would for sure recommend this to anyone looking to try tightlining.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for brows, it is very soft</li>
    <li> This was my first Sigma brush.  Based on the purchase of this brush, I bought a ton more Sigma brushes on Sigma&#x27;s website.  They are very beautiful and sturdy.  I will continue to purchase more brushes from them forever!  I&#x27;m sold.  Shop around.  Sometimes they are cheaper on Amazon, but Sigma has better prices for the most part.</li>
    <li> Have used many make up brushes throughout the years - these are the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  Have purchased several and highly recommend. A little more expensive than some but you get what you pay for.  I use for both powder and liquid foundations and they are excellent for both.</li>
    <li> Great tightlining brush. I use this to apply liner using eyeshadows mixed with a bit of water. Very good value as well.</li>
    <li> Fantastic service. Extremely fast shipping. Great product. Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;Lori</li>
    <li> Great brush! Does exactly what I need! I saw this on makeupbytiffanyd on YouTube and just had to have it. Great brush for tightening!</li>
    <li> I absolutely needed this brush in order to tightline.  I can&#x27;t imagine how else to get the tightliner on my eye without this style and shape of brush.</li>
    <li> This line of brushes is supposed to be high quality and that is exactly what I paid for and received. Bristles are firm enough to do the job but not harsh on the skin. Would recommend this brush to anyone from novice to amateur mua</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It is perfect.  I works very well.  I will probably buy a couple more to keep for back up.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love the brush, allows for precise application of color. Great quality brush and great affordable price!!!! Would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> Best Flat Brush Ever!</li>
    <li> This brush is great quality at an amazing price.  Will recommend this product, and similar products to everyone!  Will be purchasing similar products immediately!</li>
    <li> I love this brush. It is very thin and it would work for liner or placing a liner or shadow on your bottom lid or defining your brows. Just great. :)</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! It is perfect for liner, brows, concealer, you name it! Beautiful brush and wonderful quality! I always go to sigma for my brushes now! And im a previous MAC junkie!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an angled liner brush and have been wanting a flat definer brush.  This brush works great and seems to be of good quality.  I will probably buy more brushes from this brand in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with Laura Mercier tightliner eye liner.  It was a lot less expensive than the L.M. brush and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love the way this brush works. I use it almost everyday. I also love the fast shipment...thank you so much signma!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely order from your company again!!!</li>
    <li> perfect for lining the eyes</li>
    <li> Love the brush. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the Laura Mercier tightline cake, but instead of ordering her more expensive brush, bought this one instead since I had read that it&#x27;s a great dupe.  It works fantastically for tightlining your eyes!  The flat bristles enable you to get the product right into your lashline on both the top and bottom of you eye, and it places the perfect amount of product on your eyes.  This is the fourth Sigma brush I&#x27;ve purchased, and they&#x27;ve all been fantastic quality!</li>
    <li> This brush is great, if you want good tight lining for your upper and lower lids.&lt;br /&gt;This is the brush to buy.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great!! They are soft and apply the product amazingly, they are super soft and I cannot wait to buy more!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this eyeliner brush.  I wet the brush and dip into dry black eyeshadow or pot eyeliner.  It makes for a quick and easy fine line or can be made as thick as desired.  Great for tightlining the eyes.</li>
    <li> I use this brush to apply concealer under my brows- Provides a clean line and easy application. Plan to try more Sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush. I use it for tight lining my eyes and even to wing my eyes. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I liked this brush a lot - it was well made. The reason for 3 stars is that the brush is really wide. For me, it made applying liner difficult - it covered too much area on my lid.</li>
    <li> Beautiful high-quality detailer brush. I have used this both to apply the crease eye makeup brush as well as to apply eye liner. Lovely definer brush for working your eyes and creating the detail you need in your makeup application. New to the Sigma brush world but loving every single one so far. Quality: top notch! Totally worth the price. So glad Amazon carries this!</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. Received it very fast in mail. Stays very sturdy while applying product. Product goes on smoothly as well. Will buy other brushes from Sigma and this seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had high quality makeup brushes, and I had no idea what I was missing.  I bought this one and another one from Sigma.  They are fantastic.  I use this one for applying eyeshadow as eyeliner.  It picks up a lot of the makeup, applies it smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t leave little specs of the makeup all around your eye (my biggest issues with cheap brushes).  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It works great with the eye liner I bought! Also, I loved how quickly I received this brush in the mail!</li>
    <li> I like everything about this brush! Its perfect for apply shadow under your water line!! I recommend it 100%, perfect performance! I love it!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a small flat brush with a firm head to tightline the upper and lower rims of my eyes. This brush met all of my criteria. It is easy to handle, and while it is firm, it is not too stiff (if that makes any sense). I was pleased with the brush and in the timely way the company delivered it. Brush was wrapped in airtight plastic and clearly marked.</li>
    <li> Not as thin as I was hoping it would be but still works good</li>
    <li> Great brush and great experience buying it!</li>
    <li> Great brush! Very precise.</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush. Very precise. Well made... Great for undereye lines. Packs color on easily</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for tight lining under the waterline. The bristles are much softer than many other brushes I own, Including MAC, yet they are still dense enough to give you precision lining. Definitely a must have in any makeup kit!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for! I tried several brushes for my gel liner for lower lash line.  Yay Sigma!</li>
    <li> I like a thin black line right above the lashes I use this with cake liner and this brush makes this so simple Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect brush for applying eyeliner. The large flat area makes it so easy to apply and to apply the exact amount. I wish I had found this brush years ago. I use it every day now that it isn&#x27;t such a hassle to apply my eyeliner.</li>
    <li> The brush is good quality but if you&#x27;re looking for a replica of the Laura Merceer tight line brush ($35 - $45) this isn&#x27;t it. The length is too long to get an overall even tight line. The extra length of the brush makes the tight line too long and blemishes the smooth line.</li>
    <li> In love with this brush.  I have a few brushes from sigma now and I have to say this is a must have brush to apply eyeshadow under the waterline.</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are great.&lt;br /&gt;They are a good value, and I have had absolutely no shedding with any of them.  This brush is good for lining your eyes with powder.</li>
    <li> perfect brush. so happy with it.</li>
    <li> Very easy application, goes on smoothly. Definitely recommend it for tightlining or eyeliner application.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be making more purchases from the brand, you can never go wrong.</li>
    <li> The whole process was smooth and timely.  I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Good brush! This is the second one I order because I used the other one so much it eventually lost its shape. Great brush but the price tag is a little much.</li>
    <li> The shape and thinness of this brush make it perfect for tightlining. Was exactly what I needed to use with my Inglot gel eyeliner. As expected from Sigma, no shedding at all and easy to clean. I would definitely recommend this Flat Definer E15 brush if you&#x27;re wanting to create any kind of thin line on your lash line or lid, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeline brush I have purchased.  It gives me the perfect under eye line ever.  I will be purchasing another so I will always have one with me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful product</li>
    <li> not as stiff as I would have liked but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I use it with Bobbi Brown gel Eyeliner to tightline my upper lashes/waterline and it works beautifully.  I&#x27;m going to order another one I like it so much.</li>
    <li> This is the first eyeliner brush I&#x27;ve ever used but it seems to work really well for what I use it for. I&#x27;ve had it for a month or more and it is holding up, no issues at all.</li>
    <li> I needed a brush to add eyeshadow to my lower lash line and this works perfect! applies color easily and looks great.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about buying the brush, seeing as you can get ok ones slightly cheaper, but I&#x27;ve been making a point to get a better quality of product when it comes to my skin and makeup, etc. as one life lesson I&#x27;ve learned leading up to now is sometimes you are better off saving up for or paying a little extra for certain things made of \\&quot;better\\&quot; quality than to waste $ on things you&#x27;ll have to replace more frequently anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digress, the product shipped and arrived quickly. Not sure if it is a temporary promotion or what, so I can&#x27;t guarantee it would be the case in the future, but I also received a bonus brush \\&quot;gift for me\\&quot; - a travel size E25 blending brush. Nice! Essentially I got 2 brushes for the price of 1, and am very happy with my purchase thus far. I&#x27;m intending to use the brush for tightlining with the Laura Mercier Tightline Cake Eye Liner, but I&#x27;ve not received the liner just yet. The Sigma got to me first.</li>
