      <li>Luckily I got the purple bowl, which is my favorite color!</li>
      <li>I find this item very helpful, and easier then the squeeze bottles to color my hair very pleased easy to hold while applying color</li>

      <li>These hair coloring bowls are perfectly worth the money.</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t worth returning with the shipping return fees.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>I wish I would have read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>They are cheap, but they last you forever, considering one cleans them after each use.</li>
      <li>so much for stackable.</li>
      <li>the price + shipping is too much for one bowl.</li>

      <li>Didn&#x27;t make a mess and was easy to use.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal Paris Excellence Creme Hair Color, 02 Extra Light Natural Blonde.</li>
      <li>I also purchased the set of three brushes, which I received first, which only added to the impression that I would be receiving all three pictured bowls.  </li>

<li> (I see the title has since had a little addition made to it to say that it is a single bowl.)  </li>
<li> NOT WORTH IT...</li>
<li> For the price plus shipping it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
<li> I thought this because I had previously purchased the brushes that match this set, and 3 came, just as pictured.</li>
<li> So that was a little dissapointing.</li>
<li> don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
<li> bowl is small.</li>
<li> there&#x27;s not much more to it.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with the misleading information from the seller though, I likely wouldn&#x27;t have purchased a single bowl for almost $5.00.</li>
<li> but it is very small and not sure what I will use it for.  </li>
<li> and it was late getting delivered.</li>
<li> was not very happy when it arrived in the mail.</li>
<li> Very small.  </li>

    <li> This item is great! But I was expecting to get 3 bowls, as pictured. You only get one.. I thought this because I had previously purchased the brushes that match this set, and 3 came, just as pictured. So that was a little dissapointing. But it is a good quality bowl.    (BTW it didnt say single piece in the description before)</li>
    <li> I like that the bowl is deep enough to mix all of my color and developer in one bowl instead of 2.</li>
    <li> These hair coloring bowls are perfectly worth the money. They are cheap, but they last you forever, considering one cleans them after each use. Like I said, perfectly worth the money.</li>
    <li> The bowl is fine.  But based on the picture and description, I was expecting a set of three bowls.  Only got the one blue one.</li>
    <li> it is a plastic, stackable color bowl.....there&#x27;s not much more to it. i used it to mix my hair dye in, it was easy to handle (not too large/small) &amp; easily washed clean.</li>
    <li> Yes, I read the description stating only ONE bowl was included so I was not disappointed when it arrived. Luckily I got the purple bowl, which is my favorite color! I finally got serious about coloring my hair - bought this mixing,  Soft &#x27;N Style 3 Piece Rubber Color Applicator Set # 889 color wands, the perfect red color, which I have been looking for, for many years:  L&#x27;Oreal Paris Excellence Creme Hair Color, 7R Red Penny. After the red color is applied I utilized the Graham Sanek See Thru Foil Hair Color Processing 35 Styling Highlighting Sheets, and added blonde streaks with the following color: L&#x27;Oreal Paris Excellence Creme Hair Color, 02 Extra Light Natural Blonde. The bowl is well made and perfect for mixing hair color. Hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought me one of these bowls I bought it to mix my hair bleach I bleach my hair and my sisters and this is exactly what I was looking for its very handy</li>
    <li> I purchased this bowl a couple of weeks ago, and was under the impression it was all three bowls, as pictured and in the description.  (I see the title has since had a little addition made to it to say that it is a single bowl.)  I also purchased the set of three brushes, which I received first, which only added to the impression that I would be receiving all three pictured bowls.  What&#x27;s the point of having a single stackable bowl?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl itself is heavy duty plastic, very durable, and cleans up easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with the misleading information from the seller though, I likely wouldn&#x27;t have purchased a single bowl for almost $5.00.</li>
    <li> I got these to help with my highlights, but turns out that I did not need them after all anyway.</li>
    <li> cute and helpful. larger than i anticipated, but turned out to be the size i needed.</li>
    <li> I did not have this order shipped because my family provided me with these exact items but this company made it very easy to cancel.  I received a direct email from the company within a matter of minutes and I&#x27;ll be a customer always!</li>
    <li> Very small.  Maybe all three for the price but  I guess it&#x27;s my own fault for not reading details better but it is very small and not sure what I will use it for.  I would return it but it isn&#x27;t worth returning with the shipping return fees.</li>
    <li> Similar to beauty supply store bowls</li>
    <li> This product is great for mixing products for hair use. It is easy to clean, easy to use, and the handle is sturdy enough to hold and carry your products in.</li>
    <li> i wasnt able to choose the color i wanted and it was late getting delivered. was not very happy when it arrived in the mail. i would not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> this only comes with one..... make sure you read the whole description cause I had no idea it was only one..... so much for stackable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true to the description. I also didn&#x27;t read the description thoroughly enough to catch that it&#x27;s only ONE bowl, not all three.&lt;br /&gt;Is a plastic bowl worth almost $4?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good quality, by the way. As good as a plastic bowl can get anyways.</li>
    <li> I only got 1 bowl. its durable and good quality but I was expecting more. the price + shipping is too much for one bowl. don&#x27;t waste your time. if you&#x27;re able to, get to a beauty supply store instead. sure they&#x27;re cheaper</li>
    <li> ONLY 1 BOWL........ I was expecting 1 set of 3 bowls ......NOT WORTH IT... bowl is small.</li>
    <li> great bowl. shame on me for not reading the description though... it only comes with one bowl. still a great product though</li>
    <li> Like the other reviews say, ordering &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; does not give you a set of 3, as you are misguided into believing based on the picture. So, knowing this, I ordered 3 bowls, with the hope that they would give me the three bowls in different colors. NOPE! Hence, the minus 1 star on my review because they gave me two blue, and one pink bowl! If you&#x27;re going to advertise three colour options, at least give your customer all the if they&#x27;ve ordered 3!!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, these bowls are sturdy, come in pretty colors, and do their job.</li>
    <li> In the picture there are three bowls, you only get one. For the price plus shipping it&#x27;s not worth it I wish I would have read the reviews first. Shame on me</li>
    <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it help me good&lt;br /&gt;i like it ,&lt;br /&gt;it look not bad.&lt;br /&gt;~~~ ~ ~ ~</li>
    <li> Great colors and feel solid not thin.  I got these for doing multiple colors and as it would be these colors are the colors I am using so helps this blind chick distinguish which is which (Very helpful with the blue/lavender since they come out on hair very different but are very similar in bowls.</li>
    <li> They are great for hair coloring your hair etc. I would order again.</li>
    <li> R I find this item very helpful, and easier then the squeeze bottles to color my hair very pleased easy to hold while applying color</li>
    <li> Worked great to use to mix my bleach and lightning powder. Didn&#x27;t make a mess and was easy to use.</li>
    <li> I misread and thought I was getting all 3 in the photo but atleast they got the color right and I received pink...my fave!</li>
