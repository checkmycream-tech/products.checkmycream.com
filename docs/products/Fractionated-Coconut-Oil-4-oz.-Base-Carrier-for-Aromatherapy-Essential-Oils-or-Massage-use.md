    <li> Gift for granddaughter.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a carrier oil withmy essential oils.  It works great.  This oil has no scent which is perfect mixing with the carrier oils.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one bottle and to my surprise they also shipped me four others (grape seed oil, arcan, etc..) I don&#x27;t know if that was part of the $6.00 purchase but it was a bonus! I love it ! great oil for skin, hair etc.. got more than I expected!!</li>
    <li> I have ordered from this company before and I am very pleased with their service as well as the quality of their products. I just recently started using fractionated coconut oil and I luv luv luv it especially this one from plant guru . I will continue to order from this company I give them an A+++++ 😀</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never  used this type of oil before and I purchased it to use with essential oils and while i couldn&#x27;t tell a good oil from a bad at this point in my learning I&#x27;ve really liked this oil.</li>
    <li> Love this coconut oil.  Nice quality.  Fractionated means it doesnt smell like coconut oil. I use it as a moisturizer, carrier oil,etc.  love it.</li>

    <li> This works great for my essential oils and the price was great#!</li>
    <li> Incredible for rough hands.  I use it with Oil of Oregano.  Ten drops of Oregano to one ounce coconut oil as a hand sanitizer.  The side benefit is how it softens the skin after a few applications.</li>
    <li> Works great for mixing essential oils</li>
    <li> We use this with our essential oils and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is amazing clear, odorless oil that works wonderfully as a carrier oil for my essential oils. Shipping &amp; packaging couldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple coconut oil! I bought it to use as a binder for pressing my own eyeshadows, and I use it to remove my eye makeup too! Use as hair conditioner, in scrubs, in face masks, lotions...the list goes on.</li>
    <li> Bought this oil to make roller bottles for EOs.  There were a few little brown things floating in it.  Not sure if this is normal.  Looked like bugs of some kind.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time trying fractionated coconut oil. It absorb better on my legs than my face. It tends to leave a slightly oily look to my face which eventually wears off after a couple hours. I use it at night time on my face as a moisturizer. It&#x27;s great as a carrier oil for massaging.</li>
    <li> Works great, good amount for someone just starting to make rollers with essential oils. It has made 5-6 rollers and a spray bottle for bug spray and I still have 3/4 of the bottle left. I will buy again when I need more.</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent quality and I found it less expensive than others. I&#x27;ve used it mostly as a carrier oil for essential oils but also occasionally as an eye makeup remover, for a scalp treatment or to moisturize extremely dry spots of skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for years now.  I use it as a carrier oil and it perfect for what I need.  I would recommend it,</li>
    <li> If your looking for a good massage oil that isn&#x27;t greasy and lasts then this is for you!  I was very happy with how long it lasted and not being greasy was a plus!</li>
    <li> Excellent carrier oil. I love coconut so I am prejudiced about anything coconut.  I like that it is so doable with essences.  Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Great price, too! Fast shipping, secure packaging. I&#x27;ll order again and recommend to others :)</li>
