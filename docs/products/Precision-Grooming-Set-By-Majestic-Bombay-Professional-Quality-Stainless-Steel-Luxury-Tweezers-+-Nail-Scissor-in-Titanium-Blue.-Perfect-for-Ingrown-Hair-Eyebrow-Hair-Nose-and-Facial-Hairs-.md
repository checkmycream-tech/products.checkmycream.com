      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>They have become some of my favorite beauty tools in my home</li>
      <li>I have been using these scissors nonstop and they haven&#x27;t dulled yet and are still working just as good as the first time I used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I have been using these scissors nonstop and they haven&#x27;t dulled yet and are still working just as good as the first time I used them.    </li>
      <li>Good packaging and fast shipping.</li>

      <li>recommend this to everyone who wants to cut off their frequent parlor visits and manage their brows perfectly.</li>
      <li>These are so precise and its so easy to pluck the eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Overall: This grooming set is pretty awesome</li>
      <li>they are smooth and easy to grip.</li>
      <li>, the scissors work just fine.</li>
      <li>Extremely high quality which you only pay for once, cool color (blue is my favorite color), the travel case is a good complimentary item and makes it perfect for travel, and is perfect for all of your grooming needs because of the different types of tweezers it has.&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great item, especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>I’ll admit that I probably have 10 pairs of cheap tweezers all around the house.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean as well and perfect for everyday</li>
      <li>I think these would make for a really thoughtful gift this holiday season</li>
      <li>The scissor and all three tweezers are quality made and come in an awesome little case!</li>
      <li>These are a fantastic set of grooming tools you get 3 tweezers and a nail clipper they work very well and are so well made you may not ever need another set I love min and use them for all time and use them for all kinds of jobs.</li>
      <li>Since trying this set, I’ve been motivated to clean out my drawers and toss those no-good tweezers once and for all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pointed tweezers, a style that I have tried from previous brands that didn&#x27;t work for me, are great for getting out extremely fine hairs and even splinters.</li>
      <li>Excellent griping strength, very well aligned, nice and thin.</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
      <li>I have a couple of pairs of tweezers that I use often but I&#x27;ve never had a full set that comes together like this.</li>
      <li>I really like the bright blue color of the set, which makes them easy to find in case they happen to get thrown into a drawer.</li>
      <li>Straight tweezers are great for getting rid of hair in larger areas on the face or the bikini area.</li>
      <li>Product was shipped out quickly and delivered without issue.</li>
      <li>Super accurate and very well made.  </li>
      <li>I tend to get extremely fine hairs close to my eyelids which hurt since my other tweezers always pinched the skin, these tweezers were so easy to use and virtually pain free as I plucked away those fine hairs.</li>
      <li>(my old tweezers from the 0.99 store work better)</li>
      <li>It is worth the price.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s worse is that one of them isn&#x27;t the best pair.</li>
      <li>The color, in my opinion, is pretty cool.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Blue is my favorite color and this blue kind of has a metallic look to it</li>
      <li>Also, isn&#x27;t it great that it comes in a nice little black leather</li>
      <li>And, because of the pouch I have been able to carry my set to work for touch ups without searching for individual tools.</li>
      <li>I love that this set comes with three different tweezers!</li>
      <li>First off, the tweezers don&#x27;t grip that well.</li>
      <li>I am usually what most would call a cheapskate, I shop at thrift stores and dollar stores more than I do anywhere else, so</li>
      <li>Love the metallic blue.</li>
      <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
      <li>I am usually what most would call a cheapskate, I shop at thrift stores and dollar stores more than I do anywhere else, so</li>
      <li>tweezer set is definitely high quality, I could tell from the very first time I looked out them.</li>
      <li>Oh, and I think that the titanium bright blue is so pretty and different!</li>
      <li>These tweezers also really work, grabbing both fine and coarse hairs on the first try.</li>
      <li>These seem to be of high quality, and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more thrilled or excited when I opened up the little black faux-leather pouch to reveal my new treasure trove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent quality and a great price.</li>
    <li> Ok for the price. will write another review after I see if they withstand the test of time</li>
    <li> There is nothing that I hate more than spending money on sets of tweezers that just do NOT work! This has happened to me time and time again. I will go out and buy tweezer set after tweezer set thinking I was getting big quality only to be getting duds. I was wasting my money and my eyebrows were paying the price as they were being neglected in the crossfire. Enough was enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majestic Bombay was the answer to my tweezer dilemma and they couldn&#x27;t have arrived at a more opportune time. I had mysteriously lost the one pair of tweezers that actually worked for me a few days prior to my precision kit arriving in the mail which means that my eyebrows were suffering once again. I couldn&#x27;t have been more thrilled or excited when I opened up the little black faux-leather pouch to reveal my new treasure trove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tweezer set is definitely high quality, I could tell from the very first time I looked out them. The lovely dark blue color of the actual set itself seems to have been mastered through heat treating the steel. I could be wrong but when you look inside the tweezers themselves, they have a purple color and have a slow gradation to dark blue on the outside (one of the signs of heat treating). Even if they aren&#x27;t heat treated, they are beautifully designed and really stand out. I have not seems any flaking of the color as I have seen with previous tweezers I have used that were any color other than the natural silver of steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with three different sized tweezers: Pointed, Straight and Slanted. Pointed tweezers, a style that I have tried from previous brands that didn&#x27;t work for me, are great for getting out extremely fine hairs and even splinters. I tend to get extremely fine hairs close to my eyelids which hurt since my other tweezers always pinched the skin, these tweezers were so easy to use and virtually pain free as I plucked away those fine hairs. Straight tweezers are great for getting rid of hair in larger areas on the face or the bikini area. Slant tip tweezers, the ones I use the most as they are my favorite, are perfect for shaping and grooming your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, this set also comes with a lovely pair of nail trimming scissors. I never saw the use in these before as most just weren&#x27;t sturdy enough or strong enough to actually work for more than a few uses. I have been using these scissors nonstop and they haven&#x27;t dulled yet and are still working just as good as the first time I used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tweezer set is definitely worth the one time purchase price, which is a higher price point than store brand tweezers, as they are long lasting, durable, and so elegantly designed. They have become some of my favorite beauty tools in my home and I find myself using them more often than not. They also come in a lovely faux-leather pouch which makes storage and travel  breeze. This helps you keep all your tweezers and nail scissors in one convenient place rather than having to dig through a drawer or makeup bag trying to find them. This pouch also helps keep them protected against damage as there is some padding in it and it keeps the tweezers closed tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would make a lovely gift for yourself or a friend. I am thinking of maybe doing Christmas gifts with these next year, maybe create a spa day at home gift basket. Hmmm, the possibilities are endless on what I could do with these. I would highly recommend this product. I am usually what most would call a cheapskate, I shop at thrift stores and dollar stores more than I do anywhere else, so originally the price on this set had me a little worried but I would much rather pay once for high quality than keep paying for low quality products that I use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product complementary in exchange for my unbiased reviewni area.

    <li> Overall: This grooming set is pretty awesome and I definitely recommend! Extremely high quality which you only pay for once, cool color (blue is my favorite color), the travel case is a good complimentary item and makes it perfect for travel, and is perfect for all of your grooming needs because of the different types of tweezers it has.&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Quality- It is made out of stainless steel so you don’t have to worry about replacing these. Easy to clean as well and perfect for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;• Variety- The three different types of tweezers really helps you with all of your tweezing needs: big areas, ingrown hairs, splinter hairs, and really tiny hairs that just bug the crap out of you. Also, the scissor is good for fingernails and toenails.&lt;br /&gt;• Travel Case- This makes this grooming set very easy to carry around, in your purse, or while travelling.&lt;br /&gt;• Color- The color, in my opinion, is pretty cool. Blue is my favorite color and this blue kind of has a metallic look to it so it makes it look even cooler&lt;br /&gt;• Price/Bundle- Paying for all of these items separately will cost a lot more than paying for this convenient bundle. Also, for the price and considering that you only have to buy these once, $15 is a reasonable price for all 4 of these grooming tools while including a travel case and comparable/better than other items on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Price- Buying this set is definitely more expensive then just buying one simple tweezer from a generic brand so if you are extremely price sensitive and you just need a simple tweezer rarely, you might not think its worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for an honest review of the product.</li>
    <li> IMHO this is the best set available! The nail scissors work perfectly and all of the tweezers are wonderful!! I used the slim pointed ones to extract a splinter under my little fingernail. They latched on to the splinter and out it came. The fatter pointed ones work very well on nose hairs. Ouch! The quality, on a scale of one to ten is easily a ten. You will know that as soon as you have them in hand. Even the case is made well. Considering how they feel and preform this set is worth every single cent. Good packaging and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Really wanted to like this set, all I like so far about it it&#x27;s the color.&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers do t grab much (my old tweezers from the 0.99 store work better), the scissors work just fine.</li>
    <li> Perfect set of tweezers and more!</li>
    <li> Bought this item and have to say, I&#x27;m madly in love with it. My best buy of recent times. This isn&#x27;t the first such set I have bought, but it is the first one that I used more than once, and is the only one that actually does the job. Highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This is quality product at reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve used the sliver remover a couple of times and it worked great.  My wife has plucked a few stray hairs and likes the set  a lot, as well. We recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Best investment I made in a long time</li>
    <li> Nice quality. Precision points on the tweezers. Great for getting out splinters!!</li>
    <li> i like this set a lot.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of tweezers, but this set caught my eye because I needed a pair of eyebrow scissors. And their image compared to others seemed relatively sharp. I have to admit I was a little skeptical about how good the product would be. That was until I got it in the mail. If you need a set of tools to maintain your eyebrows this is the one to get!&lt;br /&gt;It comes with all four pieces and this cute metallic blue color already packed in a small black leather case. There is also extra slots in the holder in case you want to put other tools inside, but you don&#x27;t really need anything else. The design is flawless. There are no snaggle edges that you might accidentally cut yourself with. And, because of the pouch I have been able to carry my set to work for touch ups without searching for individual tools. It&#x27;s also helped me to keep them together. If you are thinking about get this. It is worth the price. I&#x27;m sure their other products are of similar stellar quality just based off this product. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Great quality set and it comes in a very convenient case.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it. There were so many raving reviews for this product. First off, the tweezers don&#x27;t grip that well. And, there&#x27;s a black substance on the inside tip of the flat tweezer. It leaves marks on my skin. Secondly, I have NO idea what the two pointy tweezers are for. There were no instructions. The only thing I like are the scissors, which is why I&#x27;m giving this three stars instead of two.</li>
    <li> This brand/product has been a joy to use when I’m grooming my eyebrows! I have always struggled with different brands of tweezers in the past because I absolutely hate having to battle that one last tiny brow hair that just refuse to get pulled! This set has different tweezers that can pull out the tiniest hair (or splinter) and I must say that it has made my eyebrow grooming routine so much faster and easier! Definitely worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

    <li> I love that this set comes with three different tweezers! One for every grooming need you have, from plucking an out of place eyebrow hair to picking out a splinter. The scissor and all three tweezers are quality made and come in an awesome little case! A great travel set or gift set for you or the man in your life!</li>
    <li> All the tools I need, no more looking for tweezers!  I love this little kit, I can trim my eyebrows, pluck any loose hairs, pull a splinter out of my kids foot, and still have an extra tool. The pointed tweezers are a bit sharp, so be careful. they are smooth and easy to grip. I have noticed the blue is starting to rub off in some areas, so that is a bummer. Eitherway this little kit has all the tweezers you&#x27;re ever going to need! Product received for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I love these.These are so precise and its so easy to pluck the eyebrows. Good hold of hair. Great for plucking out splinters. Really sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to everyone who wants to cut off their frequent parlor visits and manage their brows perfectly.</li>
    <li> These seem to be of high quality, and the price is very reasonable.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are great. I&#x27;ve used them several times since first ordering them, and haven&#x27;t noticed any decline in function or quality!</li>
    <li> These are a fantastic set of grooming tools you get 3 tweezers and a nail clipper they work very well and are so well made you may not ever need another set I love min and use them for all time and use them for all kinds of jobs. I think these would make for a really thoughtful gift this holiday season and you will not be able to find a better bargain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician. I&#x27;m a professional waxer that sees MULTIPLE clients a day and these are virtually useless. They worked maybe the first few days then stopped gripping hair altogether. What&#x27;s worse is that one of them isn&#x27;t the best pair. Literally none of them work at all. So, I&#x27;m not impressed to say the least.</li>
    <li> I have a couple of pairs of tweezers that I use often but I&#x27;ve never had a full set that comes together like this. Oh, and I think that the titanium bright blue is so pretty and different! Also, isn&#x27;t it great that it comes in a nice little black leather pouch.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really nice that there is a different pair of tweezers for a variety of issues, such as fine hairs, coarse hairs, ingrown hairs, and splinters on any area of the body. The sharp scissors can be used for trimming nails on your hands or feet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried each one and think they are of excellent quality. I&#x27;m happy to read that they won&#x27;t rust either. I haven&#x27;t had them long but it&#x27;s good to know that they&#x27;re rust proof.&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can slip this kit into my pocket or purse to take with me on the go, when travelling or staying the night somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a precision grooming set for reviewing purposes.

    <li> Super accurate and very well made.  Quite surprised.  My wife said she paid for one tweezer that was more expensive than this set and this set is better.</li>
    <li> Great item, especially for the price.  Product was shipped out quickly and delivered without issue.</li>
    <li> Very popular for good reason</li>
    <li> Beautifully well made kit.  Way better than expected.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; value.</li>
    <li> I love these. I only rated it 4 stars because 2 of the tweezers don&#x27;t really work..the angled tweezer and the long pointed one are pretty much useless to me cause it doesn&#x27;t grab and hold the hair long enough to pullnit out..but the scissor is super sharp and the short pointed tweezer is my favorite holds on and grabs even the shirt hairs that are hard to get out. My sister used it and loves it..she said my tweezer set is the &amp;#34;devil&amp;#34; cause once she started plucking she just kept going and had to line her eyebrows cause she got addicted and plucked too much off..</li>
    <li> Very good tweezers set that is made of good quality metal.They really grab hold of those tiny little hairs. Makes grooming so much easier.The supplier shipped them off fast and in a timely manner. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I’ll admit that I probably have 10 pairs of cheap tweezers all around the house. Though some of them do an okay job at pulling out stray hairs, many of them are simply useless and should be thrown away. Since trying this set, I’ve been motivated to clean out my drawers and toss those no-good tweezers once and for all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of tweezers come in a black, faux leather case. This is great for storing them at home, so I don’t lose any pieces that come in the set. It also makes them great for travel. I can simply thrown the case in my makeup bag and I’m ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers and scissors are all durable and well made. I really like the bright blue color of the set, which makes them easy to find in case they happen to get thrown into a drawer. The items are so shiny! These tweezers also really work, grabbing both fine and coarse hairs on the first try. I’ve had no issues with hairs breaking off with them either, which is a great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a really nice set of tweezers that would be great for yourself or as a gift for someone else.
