    <li> This is non-drying as well as non irritating.  I purchased TotLogic  2 in 1 Body Wash &amp; Shampoo as a hand wash. It does an effective job, and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It is excellent sulfate free shampoo and although it is gentle, it still manages to leave your hair very soft and clean. I especially like the quality of serving as both a shampoo and body wash because when you travel, you only have to bring one item with its dual purpose. Buy it and you will definitely love it as I do!</li>
    <li> This organic and sulfate free baby wash is awesome! It smells good and is natural, which is really important to me and my family. It doesn&#x27;t get sudsy , but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s sulfate free - but it works well and is completely safe and non-toxic.</li>
    <li> My daughter has battled with eczema since she was 3 months old and finding products that don&#x27;t cause her to break out is a real task! I was told about this from a fellow mother of a child who suffers with eczema and am so happy that she shared her find with me! Unlike most products that are suitable for sensitive skin, this one actually does have a scent! It&#x27;s very clean and fresh, and light, and even my daughter commented on how great it smells! Yes the bottle is a little on the smaller side, but a little bit goes a long way. It pours out easily, isn&#x27;t sticky, and lathers up nicely. I love that it&#x27;s both a body wash as well as shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t burn her eyes either. If you like this product, I&#x27;d also like to recommend [[ASIN:B00AIMV0P4 TotLogic Leave In Conditioning Spray - Free of Sulfates, Phthalates, Parabens, DEA, Formaldehyde &amp; PEG]]. I use both of these together, and they leave my daughters hair super clean and incredibly soft. Another plus is that with the conditioner, combing through tangles is a breeze!  I love these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted for Evaluation</li>
    <li> I wish I knew about this product when my kids were babies (if it was around at that time!).  I just started using this product a few months ago for my 2 children and it is great.  Smells good, not harmful to them, simple.</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for new products!  I have purchased other products from Logic Product Group&#x27;s other lines and have been very satisfied with all of them for both my dog and my daughter&#x27;s preschool uses the bed bug and lice logic products daily!  I trust this company and their products am now using  totlogic for both my daughter&#x27;s bath needs. So very happy to see this on amazon now. I first bought it directly from the company but now have the convenience of buying it here! I know that what you see is what you get in these products. Smells really light and amazing too. Very natural and gentle. Kids love it.</li>
    <li> I have really bad peeling and problems with the skin on my fingers and cannot use any soaps or shampoos that I can get at a regular store. I tried this and LOVE it!!  It does not cause any problems with my skin, my skin is finally healing. It has food foaming, gets hair really clean. I just wish I could get in a gallon size for refills.</li>
    <li> Very easy on the skin &amp; scalp.  If you have skin issues, this is the shampoo to get.  I&#x27;d just like to find a bigger bottle of it.</li>
    <li> I use it on my grandson hair and body because he is with me 5 days a week while my daughter works. Hair is soft after shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner. His skin is clean and soft after bath.</li>
    <li> Having allergies and skin sensitivities as an adult, I find that TotLogic products suit me perfectly. I use them all the time. I highly recommend them for adults as well as children.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Even before I used the conditioner, I could tell my hair was soft, which is naturally thick and coarse. I used it with Maple Holistics Silk Amino Acids conditioner and in my entire life, my hair has never been this soft! Ordered another 2 bottles right away!</li>
    <li> I like that this is natural but wished it smelled better. Not that it smells bad but do enjoy a bit of scent</li>
    <li> Given the size of the container, my initial reaction was -- is that all there is.  However, since only a tiny amount was needed to shampoo my little one&#x27;s hair, the Totlogic is going to last longer than other less expensive shampoos I&#x27;ve perviously used.  As far as performance goes, rinsing was easy and her hair looks terrific.</li>
    <li> I love this product.. My daughters skin feels so soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I really like this product for my daughter.  I love that it has no parabens or other chemicals and it has a really nice scent.  I wish it came in a larger size however.  This product is pricey but I am willing to pay more for quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for someone who likes to travel light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can just take 2 in 1 TotLogic Body Wash and shampoo when I travel with my children--no worries about chemicals, minimizes \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; I have to take--and we all can use it!</li>
    <li> This product is great and can be used for the whole family. I like that it can be used as a shampoo for the hair and also can be used as a body wash. Highly recommend this product to be used on anyone.</li>
    <li> Really like this a lot and great on my hair too. I wish I could buy larger container of it for sure. Good suds, need little, very mild scent, clear, seems very pure and gentle but works very well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and its something that is good for you</li>
    <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and this is perfect!  I love the new Totlogic line of products.  After a long day with three kids, this is not only a great product but is a time saver too!</li>
    <li> I suggest caution on all Tot-Logic product reviews. I checked and most of their products have great reviews issued by numerous \\&quot;reviewers\\&quot; within several days to a week of one another. Now it may be a great product, albeit overpriced, but the reviews don&#x27;t seem true and it seems either employees, friends, family members or perhaps the manufacturer themselves are trying to boost their ratings on Amazon.</li>
