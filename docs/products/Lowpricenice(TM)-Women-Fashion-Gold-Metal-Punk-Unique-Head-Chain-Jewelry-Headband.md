      <li>Was very cheap and didn&#x27;t fit my head at all</li>
      <li>Love it so much get so many compliments are work !</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>it is gold chains the fit on your head two on sides of head&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>Ordered it for my girlfriend but the thing doesn&#x27;t even fit over her head as the picture for this product shows.</li>
      <li>Moves around and is cheap.</li>
      <li>Do not like at all and super cheap looking plus took 3 weeks to come</li>
      <li>took a full 2 weeks to receive from china</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t come in broken &amp; it fit perfect!</li>
      <li>Very beautiful can&#x27;t believe how expensive it looks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s beautiful and it came earlier than expected!</li>
      <li>The top chain is a bit small and falls off easy.</li>
      <li>Too a long time to ship but finally got it and love it !</li>
      <li>My new email is on there !</li>
      <li>The top chain is a bit too heavy and tends to not stay in place.</li>
      <li>Still a waste, you&#x27;re better off spending that money on a candy bar or something...</li>
      <li>New</li>
      <li>Be aware the two chains on the sides of your head are not separate, they are the same length and fall the same exact way, one does not hang higher on the side of your head than the other.</li>
      <li>head chain, large center with 2 side strands.</li>
      <li>It looks really cheap and it has a chain that hangs on the back not cute</li>

    <li> Broke before I could wear it!</li>
    <li> Do not order!!! Cheap look and doesn&#x27;t fit!! Junk!!!</li>
    <li> Read some reviews about this &amp; I wasn&#x27;t so convinced on buying but it turned out to be a great head piece! It didn&#x27;t come in broken &amp; it fit perfect! Cause my head isn&#x27;t too big or too small</li>
    <li> Loved it! Really cute!!</li>
    <li> Great, and fast delivery</li>
    <li> Was very cheap and didn&#x27;t fit my head at all I gave it away</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it came with a broken piece !! Now that&#x27;s sucks 😒</li>
    <li> Fits good and very noticeable because I have cancer and no hair!</li>
    <li> Ordered it for my girlfriend but the thing doesn&#x27;t even fit over her head as the picture for this product shows. The size looks like it was meant for a child to wear... Also, the chain came tangled and it is actually unfixable (caused by an assembly defect). The only reason I&#x27;m not as upset is because this only cost 2 bucks. Still a waste, you&#x27;re better off spending that money on a candy bar or something...</li>
    <li> Beautiful and received lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> The top chain is a bit too heavy and tends to not stay in place.</li>
    <li> The top chain is a bit small and falls off easy. Maybe I just have a big head.</li>
