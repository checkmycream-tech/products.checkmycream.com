    <li> I have looked in many perfume stores for this scent. And no one carried it. So when I turned to Amazon I was happy to find it. I waited for the price to drop for a while, and finally ordered it. I love this scent!! Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite fragrance. I use it every day. It is heavy enough to last all day but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> The suit is much weaker than it used to be. I could hardly smell it.  It has been watered down. My friends had the same opinion when they try to smell it.  It has been watered down. My friends had the same opinion when they try to smell it.</li>
