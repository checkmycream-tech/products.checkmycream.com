      <li>easy to prepare and smells fabulous.  </li>
      <li>This kit makes it easy to create your own natural, healthy toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Nothing but great things to say - I&#x27;ve already bought and mixed up</li>
      <li>Not only were my teeth feeling great</li>
      <li>I do really enjoy using this as a toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I got an education by someone who&#x27;s obviously educated, dedicated and sincere in sharing knowledge for the good of everyone.</li>
      <li>super easy to make and NO chemicals, etc.  </li>
      <li>My husband says my breath is fresh!</li>
      <li>taste is that of cloves, if you don&#x27;t care for that flavor you can replace the specific ingredient with your own choice!</li>
      <li>I was able to add my own &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; of fennel and peppermint essential oils.</li>
      <li>I just became interested in making my own products at home using pure ingredients</li>
      <li>and my teeth feel super clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>Thank you from the bottom of my heart.&lt;br /&gt;This will make nice gifts for my health conscious friends &amp; family members.</li>
      <li>My teeth do feel fresh and clean after each brushing.</li>
      <li>The directions are very thorough and it was unexpectedly really easy to mix up.</li>
      <li>totally worth it</li>
      <li>They are extremely helpful and aim to make sure you are pleased.  </li>
      <li>The idea of hydrating clay with cloves and stevia is very smart.</li>
      <li>but there were only a handful of healthy ingredients.</li>
      <li>My hygienist also said that some homemade toothpastes can be very abrasive and take the luster off of your teeth - this one did nothing of the sort!</li>
      <li>The seller was also very helpful to me as well!</li>
      <li>REALLY WORKS!  </li>
      <li>Now the product comes in little easy to use baggies and the instructions are also easy to understand.  </li>
      <li>I reluctantly tried some clay toothpaste that my good friend had this past weekend.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t go back to toothpaste full of preservatives!</li>
      <li>The toothpaste recipe kit does last six months and was easy to make.</li>
      <li>The product came quickly and I love that all if the ingredients were neatly packaged in little zip lock bags.</li>
      <li>The seller includes a little newsletter with your order that not only explains how to make the toothpaste, but it also does a great job educating you on matters of your teeth and health.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a taste.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t made the toothpaste yet but for the price, the toothpaste already in a tube is much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that I miss using this product versus standard drugstore toothpaste is that fresh, tingly, mouthwashy clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>What I GOT was far more than expected.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Not only is the product stellar, but the seller is too!  </li>
      <li>The color is a light brown, so it was a little disarming to use.</li>
      <li>This is nice but much too expensive.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this natural toothpaste for a while now.</li>
      <li>And fixed</li>
      <li>: my mouth did experience some sores the first 10 days or so due to the chemical detox.</li>
      <li>I switched to this toothpaste right after my previous dentist appointment and have used it for the entire six months up leading up until this appointment.</li>

<li> I also had do throw away expensive toothbrush because mold was growing all over it.</li>
<li> Nothing wrong with anything except for the price.</li>
<li> Really expensive to just throw it all away...</li>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t made the toothpaste yet but for the price, the toothpaste already in a tube is much cheaper.  This is nice but much too expensive.  I&#x27;ll keep it though for the instructions; maybe I can use the jar to make my own with cheaper edible clay.  Everything is very nice; the scented items are fresh and pleasant smelling.  Nothing wrong with anything except for the price.</li>
    <li> I reluctantly tried some clay toothpaste that my good friend had this past weekend. And to my surprise my teeth never have felt so smooth and clean!  Not only were my teeth feeling great but there were only a handful of healthy ingredients. I have had 3 other friends try my clay toothpaste and they are all converting!  Once you start you won&#x27;t  be able to use anything else!</li>
    <li> Easy to make and tastes good. Love the way my teeth feel. I rinse with baking soda and leave a rest of the clay toothpaste in my mounth especially over night!</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste, the instructions were clear and the creation is easy.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your usage it can last a long time and of course you can swallow it, it is beneficial to health.&lt;br /&gt;The taste is that of cloves, if you don&#x27;t care for that flavor you can replace the specific ingredient with your own choice!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! if  u have any doubts about getting this FORGET THEM&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS WAY BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO THE STORES TOOTHPASTE&lt;br /&gt;my teeth feel stronger and whiter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only downside is it can make abit of a mess after brushing my teeth as the mixture is mud like.&lt;br /&gt;but totally worth it</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice from this seller.  Not only is the product stellar, but the seller is too!  I had a problem with the first batch of toothpaste I made and the seller was SO good about working with me to fix the problem.  And fixed it was!  Now the product comes in little easy to use baggies and the instructions are also easy to understand.  The seller includes a little newsletter with your order that not only explains how to make the toothpaste, but it also does a great job educating you on matters of your teeth and health.  Yes, the product is a little grainy to use, but I can feel it working and my teeth feel super clean afterwards. There isn&#x27;t much of a taste. The only thing that I miss using this product versus standard drugstore toothpaste is that fresh, tingly, mouthwashy clean feeling.  I&#x27;ve been working on a mouthwash to use with it and hope to find one that gives me that feeling.  But no matter what, I&#x27;ll continue to use this!  And I love the brown glass jar it comes in.  You can buy this product with confidence that the seller has your best interest at heart and is selling you a high-qualit, natural toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this natural toothpaste for a while now. I like it since it has none of the poisonous chemicals like the commercial ones.Makes my gums healthy too.</li>
    <li> super easy to make and NO chemicals, etc.  easy to prepare and smells fabulous.  so far, doing an excellent job!</li>
    <li> Great company and amazing product!  I had a few questions and this company promptly answered.  They are extremely helpful and aim to make sure you are pleased.  The toothpaste kit itself is very easy to use.  The end result is absolutely wonderful.  Your teeth will feel like you have just had the best cleaning of your life.  The flavor is very pleasant.  It is great to have a product so good for you,(no fluoride), so easy to prepare that REALLY WORKS!  It is my opinion that once you try this you will make a lifetime switch.  It truly is a good product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I just became interested in making my own products at home using pure ingredients and I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase. The product came quickly and I love that all if the ingredients were neatly packaged in little zip lock bags. The instructions were easy to follow and I love that the seller is there to answer your questions. Won&#x27;t go back to toothpaste full of preservatives!</li>
    <li> This was fun to use and tasted good.  The idea of hydrating clay with cloves and stevia is very smart.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste! After using it my teeth feel like they&#x27;ve just been cleaned at the dentist! The directions are very thorough and it was unexpectedly really easy to mix up.</li>
    <li> Well, the results are in from my dentist and hygienist - this organic toothpaste is a winner!!! I switched to this toothpaste right after my previous dentist appointment and have used it for the entire six months up leading up until this appointment. My plague buildup was significantly reduced and I also had healthier gums! I was told I had the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; dentist checkup - something which I&#x27;ve never heard before in my life! My hygienist is going to order the toothpaste for herself! My hygienist also said that some homemade toothpastes can be very abrasive and take the luster off of your teeth - this one did nothing of the sort! My teeth are practically shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, one of the best things about this toothpaste is that you can brush your teeth and then immediately eat a grapefruit without any flavor distortion. My husband says my breath is fresh! The toothpaste recipe kit does last six months and was easy to make. The seller was also very helpful to me as well! Nothing but great things to say - I&#x27;ve already bought and mixed up my second batch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: my mouth did experience some sores the first 10 days or so due to the chemical detox. Not everybody experiences that phase. The bonus paperwork explains the detox phase along with a lot of other information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: I&#x27;m a skeptic at heart, I don&#x27;t know the seller and was not paid or compensated to try and review this product.</li>
    <li> This kit makes it easy to create your own natural, healthy toothpaste. Avoid all the nasty chemicals found in commercial toothpaste with this simple, affordable kit. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It got moldy in two weeks. I also had do throw away expensive toothbrush because mold was growing all over it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to make my own toothpaste without fluoride, etc. I tried but my husband didn&#x27;t like it (thus, he didn&#x27;t use it). I got this as a kind of &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; to introduce myself to the basics. What I GOT was far more than expected. I got an education by someone who&#x27;s obviously educated, dedicated and sincere in sharing knowledge for the good of everyone. I was surprised with the wonderful well written literature &amp; directions. I was able to add my own &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; of fennel and peppermint essential oils. Whoever is behind this idea certainly gets my applause. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.&lt;br /&gt;This will make nice gifts for my health conscious friends &amp; family members. I had no idea such things existed! clap clap clap clap clap clap clap (head bowed in gratitude)</li>
    <li> Mine went moldy after a week. I followed the directions to a T, so I don&#x27;t understand what went wrong. Really expensive to just throw it all away...</li>
    <li> I do really enjoy using this as a toothpaste.  I just haven&#x27;t gone to the dentist to see if they notice a difference in my teeth.  My teeth do feel fresh and clean after each brushing.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste! My teeth feel cleaner and look great.  I am happy to be using this knowing it is much healthier than store-bought toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I was having some issues with sensitivity in my mouth. This product was easy to put together. The instructions were good and most of all it was easy to use and kind to my mouth. The color is a light brown, so it was a little disarming to use. But all in all, I would buy it again.</li>
