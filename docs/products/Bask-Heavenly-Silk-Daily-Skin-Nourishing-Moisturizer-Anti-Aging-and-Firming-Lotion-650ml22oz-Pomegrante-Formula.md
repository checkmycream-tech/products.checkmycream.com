<ol>
    <li> I bought this because it said &amp;#34;facial cream&amp;#34; in the ad.  The word facial was not on the bottle, but I thought instead of sending it back I would try it on the rest of my body.  It smells good, but I&#x27;ve had other lotions that lasted longer. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> liked very much. have gotten great results very good for dry skin very silky and comfortable, would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body lotion.  It does feel like silk.  I was no longer able to find it locally, so - Thanks, Amazon, for carrying it!</li>
    <li> Have used this lotion before, but still love the smell and the way it makes skin feel so silky, plus love the color of the bottle sitting out next to my kitchen sink.</li>
    <li> the smel is amazing, the feel after you put it on is like silk on your skin that turns your skin into silk. it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or thick feeling behind on your skin. I have keratosis pilaris and its help my skin so much. its not just over night help with my skin problem but in a week my bumps are gone. and when I don&#x27;t use it I feel naked without it. buy a small bottle to try and I know you&#x27;ll fall in love. and skin type should ne good , but im Asian and olive toned. but I would imagine it would work just the same on African American skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion.  Love the light weight and feel of my skin after applying it.  Great scent too.</li>
    <li> Nice smell,  and smooth hands.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels on my skin, very smooth but the odor is a little over powering. I tend not to use it often due to smell. I mixed with a non scented lotion and that helped a little. Plus it&#x27;s pricey.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion - and great price!</li>
    <li> I feel like I have tried every body lotion out there and this is the BEST.  It moisturizes ALL day, soaks in quickly, has a lovely scent, and leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.  I&#x27;m not seeing any anti-aging results but this lotion is still worth the price.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered damaged.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for Amazon, my salon quit selling this and I can&#x27;t go without this product! I love the scent and love the feel of the product.</li>
    <li> I love the Heavenly Silk Daily Nourishing Lotion!  It leaves my skin with a soft and refreshed feel.  I would truly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, makes your skin feel like silk</li>
    <li> i like the smell and how soft it leaves my skin but it takes a while to soak in and feels real wet at first.i would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion that I have ever used. It smells heavenly, no pun intended. It feels amazing on your skin and the long term results cannot be beaten. It is infused with Vitamin E and pomegranate extract, among other things, and so its anti aging properties and firming capabilities are extraordinary and hands down better than any thing else on the market I have ever used. Coming from a family of many cosmetologists and aestheticians, I can honestly say that I have tried lots of products out there too! This retails also for quite a bit more when purchased in a salon. Amazon sells it for a great price that cannot be beat.</li>
