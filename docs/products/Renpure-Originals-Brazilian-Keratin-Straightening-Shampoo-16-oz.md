      <li>and I get so many compliments on how shiny it is.</li>
      <li>While this product line isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s close enough for me.  </li>
      <li>SO hair becomes more prone to split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>They work great if you want straight hair.</li>
      <li>Hope Amazon gets more in stock soon</li>
      <li>It made it so smooth, smell amazing</li>
      <li>It looks clean, healthy, straight and it smells pleasant but not like it has a lot of product in it.is</li>
      <li>It looks clean, healthy, straight and it smells pleasant but not like it has a lot of product in it.</li>
      <li>I used this shampoo tonight and before even adding the conditioner my hair felt so unbelievably smooth</li>
      <li>I can finally enjoy, and look forward to, my showers again without the dread of scalp</li>
      <li>The shampoo is non-drying and even without conditioner my hair is smooth and manageable.  </li>
      <li>This is FANTASTIC for smoothing, controlling frizz, and shine.  </li>
      <li>It is important to me that I use hair products without parabens, sulfates, dyes, etc.</li>
      <li>So even though I don&#x27;t use shampoo very often (I prefer to co-wash my hair mostly), this one was gentle and felt good.</li>
      <li>I now have a new favorite shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
      <li>Works as well as the original Coppola for a fraction of a price</li>
      <li>I have tried dozens of shampoos/conditioners/treatments for my unruly/frizzy/wavy hair, and I was so excited to try Renpure&#x27;s Keratin straightening shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Just the smell alone is worth it!  </li>
      <li>can shampoo my hair three times in a row, but it will never feel clean.</li>
      <li>very happy with this shampoo , i have a 12 year old red head with curley hair also , and i got her using this , she hates her curls , and this does show improvment in just 2 times of using it .</li>
      <li>Hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
      <li>i have had a keratin treatment on my hair and needed to use a special shampoo to maintain treatment.</li>
      <li>I have been using the whole line of  Renpure Organics Brazilian Keratin for more than a year,..</li>
      <li>That worked fairly well, but it made my hair flat</li>
      <li>Overall, I REALLY wanted to like this product and was hoping that it would do amazing things for my hair, but Suave&#x27;s Keratin line is SO MUCH better and is also significantly cheaper.</li>
      <li>Back in the day there was a certain brand of suntan lotion with the most amazing coconut smell ever.  </li>
      <li>being said, I am pleased with the job it does compared to every other popular brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This is a good product line, and it lasts a long time, because I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.  </li>
      <li>The Penpure Shampoo and Conditioner makes my hair easy to manage, but I do still have to flatiron it to get it perfectly straight.  </li>
      <li>The good news is that even after the flat iron gets my hair straight, it still retains enough body to look really good.  </li>
      <li>It leaves it shiny and very soft, I could not stop touching my hair either.</li>
      <li>From reading other reviews, it sounds like this shampoo is made for my kind of hair!</li>
      <li>This works so awesome and is very thick.</li>
      <li>I travel frequently to visit family and friends, and I have bottles of the shampoo and conditioner, and a flatiron at every house, so I don&#x27;t have to pack as many things.  </li>
      <li>and I love the smell, my soft hair and I like that this product is safer than others containing sls.</li>
      <li>So there, use it with the conditioner and you will feel a very positive difference in your hair.</li>
      <li>and I would definitely recommend it for people that want healthy, clean and shiny hair from a shampoo that has no sodium chloride, salt, dyes, sulfates, parabens or gluten.</li>
      <li>original texture of my hair is very curly but it came out straight!</li>
      <li>Since having had a Keratin treatment administered on my hair, I&#x27;ve used this product and been rewarded with manageable, soft, easy to style hair.</li>
      <li>I now wash my hair every third or fourth day, which is great.  </li>
      <li>I now wash my hair every third or fourth day, which is great.  </li>
      <li>but I was surprised at how easy it was to comb through.</li>
      <li>Renpure Originals Brazilian Keratin Straightening Shampoo does exactly what it promises.</li>
      <li>Ok if you use it oce a week but not daily.</li>
      <li>To use the treatment, you shampoo with this first and don&#x27;t use conditioner.</li>
      <li>shampoo smells EXACTLY like the suntan lotion</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo, it has a definite coconut scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first bottle out of the two that came from the &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t want to jingset</li>
      <li>Not only is Renpure safe for keratin treated hair, it&#x27;s very affordable!  </li>
      <li>The first rinse felt unclean</li>
      <li>first time I used and RINSED the shampoo out of my hair</li>
      <li>The product seems to work at first, but then after using it for a couple months I felt like it was thining out my hair rather than straightening it.</li>
      <li>I meet!&lt;br /&gt;It has totally transformed my hair for the better.</li>
      <li>and I can guarantee that after the first shampooing, you will notice a difference in your hair.</li>
      <li>I also use the conditioner with it, although after reading some reviews, I am switching over to the Intensely Straight conditioner, because the reviews on that were very positive.  </li>
      <li>My hair tends to get a bit greasy at the roots, so I need some lather action in order to get my hair totally clean.  </li>
      <li>I was using a more expensive brand, which I THOUGHT was a good deal compared to what the salon was offering...  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, and it actually does a good job at detangling my thick hair (type 3B).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different reasonably priced shampoos without much luck.   </li>
      <li>I love that it has no SLS, parabens or any of the other &amp;#34;scary&amp;#34; ingredients that are in so many personal hygene products.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, most days I don&#x27;t even bother to dry my hair.....</li>
      <li>Although not as straight as when I use a straight iron, it was straight enough that for most days I may use my straight iron after blow drying.   </li>
      <li>originally bought the blue bottle shampoo (the one with the Argan Oil) of the same brand because one I liked the smell a little better than this and two because after all the intense reading I did over the months</li>
      <li>This shampoo really does leave my hair feeling healthy and soft, and not dry at all.</li>
      <li>This brand is designed specifically for keratin treated hair but doesn&#x27;t have the inflated ego (high price) to go with it!  </li>
      <li>If there isn&#x27;t much humidity, I can get away with just blow drying it, which is a time saver.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using the whole line of  Renpure Organics Brazilian Keratin for more than a year,.. I usually don&#x27;t stick to hair prodducts but this line one is great</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  I took a closer look at the ingredients and this shampoo contains Diazolidinyl Urea which is a FORMALDEHYDE BASED PRESERVATIVE.  Diazolidinyl Urea is a known irritant for sensitive skin and a particular no-no for anyone with eczema. I know, I know, brazilian keratin treatments often contain formaldehyde but I thought this product was a safer alternative.   I still gave this product two stars because I do like the texture of my hair after using it. But if its going to cause me skin problems its not worth it :(  PREVIOUS REVIEW:  I have long wavy hair that has a tendency to frizz. I&#x27;ve tried many different reasonably priced shampoos without much luck.   Renpure Brazilian Keratin shampoo makes my hair feel light (not weighed down), soft and silky.   I usually spend 40 minutes blowdrying my hair (its very long) and then always still have to use a straight iron to make it as straight as I like. After using the Renpure shampoo and conditioner just once it took significantly less time to blow-dry my hair and it came out straighter than usual just from blow drying. Although not as straight as when I use a straight iron, it was straight enough that for most days I may use my straight iron after blow drying.   keep in mind the following:  - I have wavy hair, not curly hair, so not sure how well this shampoo would work if your hair is really curly  - when I say this shampoo is great I am only comparing it with other reasonably priced shampoos.  - I used it with the Renpure Brazilian Conditioner and not sure how well the shampoo would work alone or with another conditioner.</li>
    <li> Ok, I do love it!  However, it does not \\&quot;straighten\\&quot; your hair.  I have long thin wavy hair (medium amount)  This is FANTASTIC for smoothing, controlling frizz, and shine.  I use both the shampoo and conditioner. In addition, I have also started using their Argan Oil (in a blue box), this is the crowning touch!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used and RINSED the shampoo out of my hair I could feel the difference in my hair!!  I did not even have to use the conditioner or dry my hair to notice the immediate difference.  My boyfriend also noticed the softness(when dry)right off.  Thankfully, most days I don&#x27;t even bother to dry my hair.....there is no frizz anymore!  If I leave it wet, and let it air dry a little, then I can wrap it up in a bun and let it down later to beautiful \\&quot;curls\\&quot;.  This stuff is great.  I only know of one store where I can buy it for $5.99, but sometimes it goes on sale for buy one, get one free.  I do not have to wash my hair everyday, and tend to have a dry scalp and skin.  Their Argan oil is awesome.  Makes your hair shiny shiny shiny.  I was afraid with the oil that it would look oily, but NOT!  Great products!!!!!!</li>
    <li> If this were just a regular moisturizing shampoo, I&#x27;d definitely give this 5 stars, but seeing as it&#x27;s supposed to straighten your hair - or at least make it easier to straighten - I&#x27;ve only given it 4. I love the smell, and it actually does a good job at detangling my thick hair (type 3B). It also makes it a tad easier to straighten - just a tad, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this with the keratin leave-in stuff, as it made my hair start to break off after a while. I&#x27;m going to keep up the search for my perfect shampoo for now, but who knows - maybe I&#x27;ll come back to Renpure a little later.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner on a whim.  I have not been happy with my hair products for awhile now.  Suffering from dry frizzy hair, nothing would make it soft and always felt rough to the touch.  I used this shampoo tonight and before even adding the conditioner my hair felt so unbelievably smooth and I could run my fingers through.  Truthfully I could not stop touching my hair in the shower!!  I have never had a shampoo make my hair feel so soft and not waxy.  For the price and the amazing product with no harsh chemicals I kind of feel like I just won the hair lottery!!!  Please dont stop making this product!!!</li>
    <li> I really do like this shampoo.  It cleans my hair in one pass, but as others have noted, it tends to be drying, and my hair has been colored, which makes it somewhat dry to begin with.  I also use the conditioner with it, although after reading some reviews, I am switching over to the Intensely Straight conditioner, because the reviews on that were very positive.  I think I have tried every product there is, by every manufacturer I have ever heard of, and a few I have never heard of.  This is a good product line, and it lasts a long time, because I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it.  It is also  inexpensive, and it smells pleasant, not like a mass of chemicals over layered with fragrance.  I have a lot of wavy, thick, flyaway hair that is the bane of my existence.  There is also one spot in the back that is hideously curly and impossible to deal with.  In desperation, I even had a Brazilian Blowout  at the salon.  That worked fairly well, but it made my hair flat and it always felt greasy to me.  I was washing it every day or every other day, and I hated it.  The Penpure Shampoo and Conditioner makes my hair easy to manage, but I do still have to flatiron it to get it perfectly straight.  The good news is that even after the flat iron gets my hair straight, it still retains enough body to look really good.  If there isn&#x27;t much humidity, I can get away with just blow drying it, which is a time saver. While this product line isn&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s close enough for me.  I have it on Subscribe &amp;  Save every two months for the shampoo and every three for the conditioner, although I could probably get away with every four months for the conditioner.  I travel frequently to visit family and friends, and I have bottles of the shampoo and conditioner, and a flatiron at every house, so I don&#x27;t have to pack as many things.  The only downside is that friends and relatives also like it and have to replenish my supplies!  Other than dryness, which the conditioner should alleviate, there is no downside for me.  I now wash my hair every third or fourth day, which is great.  It looks clean, healthy, straight and it smells pleasant but not like it has a lot of product in it.is no downside for me.  I now wash my hair every third or fourth day, which is great.  It looks clean, healthy, straight and it smells pleasant but not like it has a lot of product in it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does a good job at smoothing down, moisturizing and managing coarse, wavy hair that tends to be dry and frizzy.  However, it is an overstatement to call it a \\&quot;Straightening\\&quot; shampoo.  If there is one that can take wild hair and make it lay flat, I&#x27;d like to know what that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I am pleased with the job it does compared to every other popular brand I&#x27;ve tried. At $6.00 a bottle, it&#x27;s not too expensive, and worth it in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would probably work best with thicker, coarse hair with more body that needs to be tamed.</li>
    <li> Meh. This is only so so. Ok if you use it oce a week but not daily. Weighed my fine hair down to a lackluster limp blah. Very disappointed :(</li>
    <li> Yes it is an overstatement that if you wash your hair with this shampoo your hair will dry and be straight but it does a very good job and I can guarantee that after the first shampooing, you will notice a difference in your hair. It leaves it shiny and very soft, I could not stop touching my hair either. My hair is thick and almost curly and it leaves my hair with less frizz and less volume (on top of having thick curly hair, I have SO much hair)... So there, use it with the conditioner and you will feel a very positive difference in your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo &amp; conditioner at Shop Rite for $7 each. They work great if you want straight hair. My natural hair is very curly, has volume &amp; can be frizzy on humid days. Renpure eliminated the frizz &amp; made it straighter. I was using it for 6 months &amp; wearing my hair straight but now that I want my big frizzy curls back, it looks as though I&#x27;m going to have to grow out my hair for it to be big again.&lt;br /&gt;This product is good if you&#x27;re going to wear your hair straight but not good for curls over a long period of time. This will make your hair straighter each time you use it. I&#x27;ll use it when I want straight hair but not as an everyday shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bougth the shampoo and conditioner and after use it two times I throw it away.Left my hair super super dry and with a lot of tangles. This product should be good for your hair no make it worse. Hate it!!</li>
    <li> I have used expensive salon conditioner from Pureology for years.  This product, at less than half the price, does a far better job.  I will be buying it as long as they make it (and I have hair ;-)).</li>
    <li> My wife and I have switched to 100% organic health products, and this was our first choice with all natural hair products. Love it, leaves our hair feeling great.</li>
    <li> I love love love this shampoo! I love that its all natural without harsh chemicals that actually damage hair. This shampoo really does leave my hair feeling healthy and soft, and not dry at all. I have yet to use the other renpure products,  but for now I&#x27;m buying this in bulk.</li>
    <li> I hate it because of its very strong coconut smell and because of that I stopped using it @ @</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to use in conjunction with the 14 day straight Keratin treatment. To use the treatment, you shampoo with this first and don&#x27;t use conditioner. I expected a tangled mess but I was surprised at how easy it was to comb through. I have been using this for a few days now and I love the smell, my soft hair and I like that this product is safer than others containing sls. As far as weather or not this helps straighten your hair, I wouldn&#x27;t know because I am also using the treatment.</li>
    <li> This product is NOT effective. It does not assist in straightening thick or coarse hair. Please do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> It completely dries out the hair . SO hair becomes more prone to split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not suitable for curly and thin hair. It turned my hair white and increased hairfall .. in a day .. it was so drying .. also itches on the scalp .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not suitable for  thin hair. Do not try .. it will spoil ur hair texture and strength.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Makes my hair soft and keeps it straight ALL DAY!  Be sure to use conditioner too though! Only using Shampoo may appear hair is drying but it really isn&#x27;t.  Love the texture, lather, and smell of this shampoo!  Already ordered 6 bottles to stock up!  Hope Amazon gets more in stock soon cuz I like the $9.99 price!</li>
    <li> THIS IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS. I used this brand shampoo for almost a year and just chose to refill through this seller. Boy was I surprised when I washed my hair this morning. What I received was NOT the gently cleansing, subtly coconut fragranced, creamy shampoo that this is pretending to be, but a white, harsh, product that smelled like an old lady&#x27;s perfume and stripped my hair of ALL THE OILS. MY HAIR IS A RUINED FRIZZBALL. I worked for months to get my hair to the manageable level that is was at, and this ruined it in THIRTY SECONDS FLAT. I just hope I don&#x27;t get an allergic reaction from whatever was in the bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY FROM HERE. BUY FROM THE COMPANY. I am waiting to hear back from the company and will be looking to return this product for a refund.</li>
    <li> Very creamy shampoo.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to strip or dry the hair.  I ordered the product by mistake, thinking I had ordered a double pack of the conditioner.  When I called Amazon customer service, they credited me and told me to keep the shampoo.  Wow!  So even though I don&#x27;t use shampoo very often (I prefer to co-wash my hair mostly), this one was gentle and felt good.</li>
    <li> It is important to me that I use hair products without parabens, sulfates, dyes, etc. I have tried several that leave my hair dull and brittle. Renpure Originals Brazilian Keratin Straightening Shampoo (used with the conditioner) leaves my hair extremely soft and shiny. My husband can&#x27;t stop touching it! My hair is wavy and when I blow dry after using Renpure I do not have to also straighten it. It certainly isn&#x27;t as straight as it would be if I got a chemical treatment, but there is a noticeable difference. My one complaint is that my hair looks greasy by the end of the day. With other products I can usually get away with only washing my hair every other day, but with Renpure I need to wash daily or it looks pretty bad.</li>
    <li> I now have a new favorite shampoo and conditioner!  Not only is Renpure safe for keratin treated hair, it&#x27;s very affordable!  I was using a more expensive brand, which I THOUGHT was a good deal compared to what the salon was offering...  but Renpure is HALF that cost!  This brand is designed specifically for keratin treated hair but doesn&#x27;t have the inflated ego (high price) to go with it!  My hair is soft and not frizzy, even if I let my hair dry naturally and sleep on it damp.  I&#x27;m so happy to have stumbled across this brand, and grateful that they offer such quality products at excellent prices!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I first saw this shampoo at my local Food Lion grocery store but kept on sticking with other brands I knew and were comfortable with up until about a year ago when my hair started going totally crazy on me for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started trying all these new products, treatments, herbs, oils, you name it and nothing seemed to work so after a few wasted bucket loads of money I decided to start trying different shampoo&#x27;s and see what worked....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought the blue bottle shampoo (the one with the Argan Oil) of the same brand because one I liked the smell a little better than this and two because after all the intense reading I did over the months Argan Oil had some rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan Oil shampoo did quite well for a short while but then my hair started going nuts again so my search begun all over. This time I started my search on Amazon and after a few hours for some odd reason I decided to try this one and I am SO glad I did that words cannot describe my happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first bottle out of the two that came from the &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t want to jingset but I think this may just be the answer to whatever was wrong with my hair all of a sudden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, straight, thin brown hair (never dyed, highlighted, chemically treated) so except stress and or change in water treatment in my area (which I have no heard of, just guessing) I really cannot think of anything else that could have affected my hair in such a negative way for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now this is my go to shampoo and I would definitely recommend it for people that want healthy, clean and shiny hair from a shampoo that has no sodium chloride, salt, dyes, sulfates, parabens or gluten.</li>
    <li> This works so awesome and is very thick. I will probably buy them again. I used this with the Renpure 14 day straightening serum. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Back in the day there was a certain brand of suntan lotion with the most amazing coconut smell ever.  Perhaps you know the one I am thinking of.  I have forgotten the name of it, and I am not even sure if they make it anymore.  Maybe it was Hawaiian Tropics?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo smells EXACTLY like the suntan lotion I remember so fondly!  I LOVE using this shampoo!  Just the smell alone is worth it!  It is HEAVENLY! (For those of you concerned of it having too much smell, it doesn&#x27;t.  It is just perfect.  Not too much, not too overpowering, but not too little either.  It is not like Bath &amp; Body Works products where the smell is with you from the minute you use it.  This will be with you un-noticeably, and then out of the blue you will turn your head, or a gentle breeze will sweep by you, and you will get a gentle reminder of that coco-nutty heavenly smell!  Its to die for!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, not only does it brighten my mood every time I use it, it also has proven to be the only shampoo NOT to irritate my scalp!  I NEVER have any red inflamed areas at my temples after shampooing, nor does it cause my scalp to itch like so many other shampoos I have tried!  I finally figured out that any shampoo containing Sodium Laurel Sulfate would cause my scalp to become inflamed for days.  While it may have something in it I don&#x27;t recognize, it does not have SLS.  And I am happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found this shampoo &amp; conditioner!  If you have searched for a shampoo that finally works for you, and does what you need it to do, then you will completely understand why I gush over this shampoo.  I can finally enjoy, and look forward to, my showers again without the dread of scalp irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope if you give it a try it will work as well for you!  I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> Is ok, not great. Service was good though.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, frizzy hair and this Shampoo and Conditioner changed the texture completely! It made it so smooth, smell amazing and I get so many compliments on how shiny it is. I recommend it to everyone I meet!&lt;br /&gt;It has totally transformed my hair for the better.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!! You have no idea how frizzy and poofy my hair was before using this conditioner (and shampoo). &amp;#34;Poofy&amp;#34; is the only word I know to describe it. Before this, I used Suave Keratin shampoo and conditioner, and after switching, I noticed a change almost instantly. My hair dries feeling cleaner and straighter. I don&#x27;t even have the frizzy fly-aways I used to. My hair is no longer dry, and I don&#x27;t feel the need to constantly use heat on my hair. I will never change my shampoo and conditioner again! I have found my miracle cure, I hope this is yours, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*My hair is very thick and needed lots of taming! From reading other reviews, it sounds like this shampoo is made for my kind of hair!</li>
    <li> This product is great for my shoulder length, fine hair&lt;br /&gt;I was suffering hair loss and dry/fizziness&lt;br /&gt;It instantly made my hair smooth, shiny and thick and the hair loss stopped immediately&lt;br /&gt;Also great moisturizing for dry scalp and has a delicious coconut scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many different products and some really expensive treatments, but this product is very reasonably priced and it works for my hair</li>
    <li> Renpure Originals Brazilian Keratin Straightening Shampoo does exactly what it promises. Since having had a Keratin treatment administered on my hair, I&#x27;ve used this product and been rewarded with manageable, soft, easy to style hair. This is also without the harsh chemical odor common in other highly touted hair care line.</li>
    <li> This is extremely heavy and weighs my hair down to no end. Hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean. Normally, I can go 2 or 3 hairs without washing my hair, but with this, I have to wash it the next day.</li>
    <li> Bought this at a local drugstore. I wish I would&#x27;ve saved my receipt, so I could have returned it. The first rinse felt unclean so I repeated. Instantly tangled and dried out my hair terribly. Conditioner couldn&#x27;t make up for what it did. I don&#x27;t understand anyone liking this shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair is thin/wavy/frizzy, and this shampoo/conditioner combo absolutely does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I can shampoo my hair three times in a row, but it will never feel clean. It always feels a little greasy. Which would be fine, but it also feels dry even when the hair itself is wet with water. It&#x27;s not moisturizing, it&#x27;s not volumizing, it&#x27;s not nourishing. My hair always feels dry, dirty, and it&#x27;s tangled regardless of how long I&#x27;ve left the conditioner in.</li>
    <li> I applied the treatment yesterday, and went to a salon today to have it washed out after 24 hours (actually, if was over 24 hours because I was at work). Anyway, after the salon washed out the product and blow dried my hair. OMG. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The original texture of my hair is very curly but it came out straight! Dont know how it will hold up to moisture. Will update.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo along with the 14-Day Straight product by the same company. When using the 14-Day Straight I do not use the conditioner as it keeps the 14-Day Straight from working as well. The shampoo is non-drying and even without conditioner my hair is smooth and manageable.  That&#x27;s saying a lot since I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron to style my hair.  Love this shampoo, it has a definite coconut scent.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the original Coppola for a fraction of a price</li>
    <li> i have had a keratin treatment on my hair and needed to use a special shampoo to maintain treatment. I looked at other shampoos but the prices were in the $20-$25 range. This shampoo was less than $10. It works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo along with the conditioner and the 14 day straigntening serum.  I have naturally wavy/curly hair and wanted my hair to be silky and limp.  This product was not at all what I was looking for.  It made my hair feel dry and it coated it, making it feel heavy and dirty.  I would never recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, and leaves my hair feeling silky even before conditioner. I love that it has no SLS, parabens or any of the other &amp;#34;scary&amp;#34; ingredients that are in so many personal hygene products.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work at first, but then after using it for a couple months I felt like it was thining out my hair rather than straightening it. I stopped using it about a year ago and my hair is just starting to re-gain its thickness.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and when i used this product i broke out in red bumbs all over my neck and back, basically anywhere the shampoo touched so for me personally or anyone who is sensitive to perfumes ect i would not reccomend using this shampoo renpure amazing miracle reconstructor is the best conditioner i have ever used though!</li>
    <li> very happy with this shampoo , i have a 12 year old red head with curley hair also , and i got her using this , she hates her curls , and this does show improvment in just 2 times of using it .</li>
    <li> With curly/dry hair you have to be careful in your choice of hair care products, Renpure really fits the bill for me and my hair</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of shampoos/conditioners/treatments for my unruly/frizzy/wavy hair, and I was so excited to try Renpure&#x27;s Keratin straightening shampoo and conditioner.  Unfortunately I could not get the shampoo to lather--not one bit.  My hair tends to get a bit greasy at the roots, so I need some lather action in order to get my hair totally clean.  It left my hair super tangled and also weighed my hair down tremendously.  Overall, I REALLY wanted to like this product and was hoping that it would do amazing things for my hair, but Suave&#x27;s Keratin line is SO MUCH better and is also significantly cheaper.</li>
