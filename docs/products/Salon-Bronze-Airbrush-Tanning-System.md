      <li>I spray it on my legs and the color doesn&#x27;t look good at all.</li>

      <li>The self-tanning products that are lotions are a much better buy and cheaper to boot!</li>
      <li>This is not a product that you can use perfectly well your first time.</li>
      <li>AND IT SHOULD WORK PRETTY GREAT FOR YOU!!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Your shower is clean and you have a beautiful tan.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>This works so amazing when you watch a video like this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
      <li>It turned out amazing no streaks and no orange.</li>
      <li>This product is truly amazing</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for years and its absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>This product works amazingly</li>
      <li>Best for beginners to get the hang of it without the problems you might get with more powerful systems.</li>
      <li>it was nice</li>
      <li>It was painstaking getting a nice even tan.</li>
      <li>I would recommend having someone else spray you to get a nice even effect.</li>
      <li>Good luck :)</li>
      <li>and you dont even need it honestly.   </li>
      <li>and I had liked it, but</li>
      <li>I love love love it!  </li>
      <li>NOT TO PRETTY, BUT THIS WORKED GREAT</li>
      <li>It does give a great color and is super easy to use.</li>
      <li>The trick is having someone spray you and making sure they stand 8 inches away.</li>
      <li>I love this spray tan.  </li>
      <li>From an experienced tanner and someone who doesn&#x27;t get the slightest bit of color from the sun, this product is my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>However, it came more.</li>
      <li>and I think will continue to look better the more used to applying it you get.</li>
      <li>Make sure you do it in the tub bc</li>
      <li>I found this product and I love it.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;ll just need to apply it a couple more times.</li>
      <li>so the arms have slightly more streak than the rest of my body but not terrible.</li>
      <li>More even than the wipes have been and probably a better color.</li>
      <li>apply with even stroke motions and everytime you shake it make sure you  &lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>With mystic that has washed off but since I wasn&#x27;t sure I rubbed it off with alcohol wipes and used the sponges to reapply to my arm in that area</li>
      <li>i love tanning</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re going to want to dab each area with a towel after each stroke to make sure that it doesnt run or leave spots.</li>
      <li>I WISH IT WOULD COME WITH MORE SPRAY THO.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>However, make sure you are not wearing under-arm deoderant when you apply this.  </li>
      <li>:) make sure to hold it away from you like 12 inches or so.</li>
      <li>If you get splatters you can rub them to even over your skin and just be sure to soap up your hands afterward.  </li>
      <li>This is better  </li>
      <li>(And that is many over the years)</li>
      <li>my face, I use Famous Dave&#x27;s moisture tan lotion.</li>
      <li>But the color is pretty nice!</li>
      <li>MAKE SURE NOT TO PUT IT ON YOUR HANDS.</li>
      <li>you get better at it.</li>
      <li>my wife absolutely loves it!!!!</li>
      <li>For the best price i buy it at sallys in the store...with coupons and my member discount...otherwise this would be pretty pricey but still cheaper than tanning beds and much better for your skin because you can supplement with real sun time.  </li>
      <li>At first when I used this product I LOVED it.</li>
      <li>The color looks great and natural.</li>
      <li>For only 12.99$ for the airbrush sprayer and 9$ for each refill is such a great price for the AMAZING RESULTS!!!!!!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Had to put brown sheets on my bed to keep from ruining them. Woke up looking disgusting. Had to shower immediately. The mist was super heavy, so it kept building up on the can and then dripping down my body. My boyfriend was wiping the thing down every 2 seconds (literally). Luckily most of the nastiness washed off, but my tan was significantly lighter. My feet, however, are completely orange. I think because the mist was so heavy, it soaked the towel I was standing on and my feet started absorbing it! This did not happen at all when I used Neutrogena MicroMIst. I thoroughly lotioned my feet before we sprayed too. I guess I will not be wearing any flip flops this week! I am definitely going back to the Neutrogena MicroMist next time. It sprayed much more evenly and did not have that nasty dye in it. By the way, it has the same after smell as any other DHA product, only it doesn&#x27;t seem to contain any scent to cover it up.</li>
    <li> First off I NEVER write reviews on ANYTHING, this will be my first, I&#x27;m an experienced tanner for years as I was a manager for a tanning company, recently I had a baby and unfortunately couldn&#x27;t tan, I love tingle lotion but starting to tan I couldn&#x27;t use because of the effects it would cause on my babies skin, I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to tan anymore. So I decided to do my usual spray tanning and store bought stuff. One day in Sally&#x27;s beauty store I seen this product and thought hmm I&#x27;m going to try it. Showered and shaved and moisturized. Stepped back in the shower and sprayed myself 10 to 12 inches away. My husband came in and said wow you have great color. It turned out amazing no streaks and no orange. I dont know how these have some bad reviews. If you know what you&#x27;re doing then it should come out perfect! Plus $8 for refills equals awesome never will I buy anything else! Plus the price is great</li>
    <li> I love this spray tan.  It was the first one I ever used.  I was terrified I would turn orange, but decided to try it anyway.  It works wonders if you follow the directions perfectly.  I put a very thick layer of lotion on my hands, feet, and elbows.  You really need someone to spray you to apply it evenly.  I would never attempt to do it myself.  It lasts about 3-6 days.  One thing I would warn about is that if you apply it, and then sweat (work out, wear uggs, ect.) it will blotch and look very strange.  I would not participate in any activity that makes you sweat until you have had a shower.  The product does not make me look orange, and it gives a very natural looking tan.  I apply it in layers until I become the color I want. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you need someone to apply it.  Otherwise the product itself is 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is my second summer using this product and I love it.  To all of the people complaining that the self tanner was green, it&#x27;s because you got an OLD cartridge.  I know this because I still had half a cartridge left from last summer and I sprayed it to see if it was still good, and it was green.  Blame whom ever you purchased your cartridge(s) from, not the product.  That notorious \\&quot;self tanner\\&quot; smell is very mild compared to other self tanners. It&#x27;s very natural looking.  The spray gun works just fine.  I love it!</li>
    <li> i have been using bodydrench spray mist but it was out of stock from my regular dealer so i went with this stuff. the main problem is that it shoots a jet stream for a sec b4 going to mist. so everytime you pull the trigger it will shoot a stream and then go to mist (even when you wipe the tip between sprays). very messy and ineffective.</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this system. While the color it gives when developed is decent...its nearly impossible to get a good, even application. My trouble was, it didnt seem to give a nice even mist. Whenever I would first pull the trigger, it would squirt a stream of product that would then be concentrated in one area of my skin and be dripping down. I&#x27;d have to run and get a towel and wipe it all off my skin and start over. I then tried pointing it away from my body when first pulling the trigger but then it would squirt the stuff all over my white walls or on my carpet and Id have to clean that up too. I tried everything I could think of to get it to stop doing that. I would squeeze the trigger as gently as possible but it would still do it every single time. It never failed. It was painstaking getting a nice even tan. And another thing was how expensive it ended up being! Im a pretty petite person at 5ft and 110 lbs and I could still only do maybe 2 to 3 applications before it was time to buy a new cartridge. It honestly ended up being cheaper for me to just buy spray tan sessions at my local tanning salon. So my salon bronze will either be thrown away, or will be put away in a box somewhere and likely never used again.</li>
    <li> I have been getting spray tans professionally since I was 12 and in the past few years I moved away from my airbrush lady and can&#x27;t find another like her so I&#x27;ve experimented with everything under the sun. I ran out of my fake bake and found this at sallys it was so cheap I figured what&#x27;s the worst that could happen. I tried it last night and it came out very good and very even, you HAVE to hold it away from your body so the mist catches on, otherwise of course you&#x27;ll get blotches and drips. When it came out heavier on some spots I just rubbed it in, no problem. I like that it dried fast and didn&#x27;t smell at all. I woke up this morning and took a shower it wasn&#x27;t as dark as some of the other products I&#x27;ve used but it still looked dark but I like to be extremely dark and I&#x27;m extremely pale normally so this could be why and i&#x27;ll just need to apply it a couple more times. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is the fact that I&#x27;ve used really high end self tanners and gotten instant dark dark results.</li>
    <li> i bought the airbrush gun and two cartridges from \\&quot;deals2thedoor\\&quot; and a refill cartridge from \\&quot;sally&#x27;s beauty supply\\&quot;. The plastic container from \\&quot;deals2thedoor\\&quot; that held the gun and two cartridges arrived slightly open, exposing the two cartridges and the when I went to use the cartridges from &#x27;deals2thedoor\\&quot;  the tanner came out bright GREEN, dying my skin a bright green, kinda like a frog. so i checked the refill from \\&quot;sally&#x27;s\\&quot; hoping it was supposed to be green...NOPE the refill from \\&quot;sally&#x27;s\\&quot; was a great bronze/brown color, which gave my skin the color i wanted....after that is, i had to jump in the shower and roughly scrub off the BRIGHT GREEN color. Needless to say don&#x27;t buy products from \\&quot;deals2thedoor\\&quot;, who know what color they will give you, stick with \\&quot;sally&#x27;s beauty supply\\&quot; they now what their doing, they get 5 stars!</li>
    <li> got this quickly packeging was fine got it out and sprayed it into my sink to see how it would come out and it is lime green! this is clearly not correct</li>
    <li> I bought this from Sally&#x27;s and it gives a good tan on my arms, but that&#x27;s it. I spray it on my legs and the color doesn&#x27;t look good at all. It is a really good price just wished it worked all over instead of just my arms.</li>
    <li> OK so i am naturally very very pale like a ghost ! for the past 3 years iv been self tanning with the self tanners from like CVS and WALMART and i was never happy with the results because they were always streaky and took 8 hours to develope color and never seemed to dry. The color was never even. I was trying to find something that had good reviews and that people seemed to like so i found out about Salon Bronze Airbrush Tanning System and i thought well its worth a try. So i tried it and i was AMAZED by the results ! The color develops in minutes! and lasts up to almost a week. But when you first spray it on, it really look blotchy and cheap, but if you give it a minute or two, it will spread out and even out on its own! I am so happy i found this product and i will be using it for now on. For only 12.99$ for the airbrush sprayer and 9$ for each refill is such a great price for the AMAZING RESULTS!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter to use and it is NOT worth $1.99 let alone $19.99. Not only was the color uneven as it came out but the gun dripped horribly if you didn&#x27;t keep it completely upright. If you get too close to the skin it comes out really dark and if you aren&#x27;t close enough it comes out with splotchy spray marks. HORRIBLE!!!! We finally just sprayed the product on make-up wedges and sponged it on. Even then it was too dark in spots and too light in other. The self-tanning products that are lotions are a much better buy and cheaper to boot!</li>
    <li> I LOVED THIS! I WISH IT WOULD COME WITH MORE SPRAY THO. I WAS ALWAYS USING SELF TANNERS, WHICH JUST MADE ME ORANGE AND HAVE STREAKS! NOT TO PRETTY, BUT THIS WORKED GREAT AND I WAS TANN!! DO WHAT THE DIRECTIONS SAY AND IT SHOULD WORK PRETTY GREAT FOR YOU!! DOESNT LAST AS LONG AS I WISHED THO.</li>
    <li> completely disappointed the tanning cartridge was either replaced or incorrect to begin with , before i received it. i turned lime green .. because it sprays lime green.  despite the picture, you do not get 2 tanning cartridges only 1 . the facial applicators are triangle make-up sponges . the gun is generic plastic and you dont even need it honestly.   I would strongly suggest buying sally hansens spray tans .</li>
    <li> I totally disagree that this product is horrible! People don&#x27;t realize that you have to apply it correctly and spray evenly! I have gotten pleanty of these done professionally and I am much happier with this. It costs less and you can go as dark as you want. You&#x27;ll also have to realize that if you do spray from farther away you will get really tinny spots (not leak spots) that catch on the hair (this is normal) but all you do is let it dry a bit and then dab dry with a towel! REMEMBER* apply with even stroke motions and everytime you shake it make sure you  &lt;br /&gt;spray on a paper towel first this will prevent splotting! Personally I don&#x27;t prefer the makeup applicators. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> It works pretty good..need to be careful spraying it. No odor..thats great. I put it on an hour ago..hope it gets tanner as they said it wouod. BTw..at Sally beauty supply, it costs $12.95 for the whole thing not double the price on Amazon</li>
    <li> Ok so if you&#x27;re searching for a good airbrush tanning spray this is very good. The color is AWESOME. No orange at all like dark bronze color like you spent the week on the beach. BUT the spray doesnt spray so good.. it drip on the floor and on the skin and so you have to blend it with a brush after (i use a large makeup brush like a Kabuki) so it look fine. The MAJOR problem and i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but you have an alert message on the box that say that it CAUSE CANCER. I use this to avoid skin cancer from the sun so if i can get lungs cancer from this one i&#x27;m screwed lol  Anyway if you don&#x27;t care about cancer its a good product but do it on a blanket or a towel and blend with a brush after.</li>
    <li> This is an easy to do self tanner. Best for beginners to get the hang of it without the problems you might get with more powerful systems. It has little to no smell. It leaves your skin feeling good. It&#x27;s biggest drawback is that it&#x27;s just very weak. 2 days later very little left to notice. Expensive when you consider i used the whole canister for that.</li>
    <li> This product was not worth the money i spent on it. i put lotion on my feet before hand as instructed yet now my feet are orange and my toenails are yellow! I gave my skin 24hrs to dry and in the shower it still washed most of the product off. I have orange sploches all over and am still mostly pale. when the spray came out of the gun it didnt spray evenly and we ended up having to just dab the product on. also customer service was very unhelpful and rude. i suggest you go somewhere else for a tanning product unless you want to look like a spotted oompa loompa</li>
    <li> my solution was GREEN, bright green like St. Patricks day green! terrible product! do not order from this user</li>
    <li> The results I had were great.  However, make sure you are not wearing under-arm deoderant when you apply this.  I only say that because the temporary results are disconceting.  The where the deoderant is applied, the spray takes on a green hue.  once it dries, it is fine, but it was a bit disturbing at first.  Also, a couple of hours before you apply the salon bronze be sure to moisturize your skin - especially around the ankles, heels, elbows, and hands.</li>
    <li> I buy this product once or twice a month at Sally Beauty Supply. I have been spray tanned for years in a salon and I was looking for a cheaper alternative. I found this product and I love it. The color looks great and natural. I am a high school teacher so my students are always the biggest critique. (They notice everything!) My students always notice when I suddenly look tanner and can&#x27;t believe when I tell them I spray tan myself. To get the best results I always spray tan at night. I blot areas with a towel that are dripping or too dark. I apply several light layers until the can is gone. I allow myself to dry and then I put on pajamas and go to sleep. I wake up in the morning looking freakishly dark but then I shower and get the naturally dark tan look I was going for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s o much better than lotion!!!! I&#x27;ve been using lotions and going to tanning beds for a while, I decided to try this just because it was on sale and it turned out to be great!!! YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS to get expected results... and everytime you apply it you get better at it. I like to apply it right after a shower (use lotion before applying). Great natural color, dries quick, no weird smell, doesn&#x27;t turn pamls orange, doesn&#x27;t tranfer to clothes</li>
    <li> I used this weekly a few years ago. I loved this product. Have never had a bad experience. The stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I read a few reviews about it getting all over everything. And I have to say obviously you didnt use your head and GET IN THE SHOWER and spray it in there. When you are done spray it down with your shower cleaning product. Once you are completely dry grab a cup and rince the it off. Your shower is clean and you have a beautiful tan.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, but worked like advertised. Didn&#x27;t last very long, but went on easily, absorbed well, and darkened fine. The color was a little on the orange side, and like I said, it didn&#x27;t last very long, but for the price it was a decent product.</li>
    <li> I tried everything to be tan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And nothing work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this and I have a instant tan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No stains no strong smells like other products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it is so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product</li>
    <li> I do not like this product because of the side effects indicated on the tan spray can that it may cause cancer.Why sell such products to consumers?Its such a shame!</li>
    <li> Omg this is the worst orange tan ever. It left little brown spots on my skin. I would never, ever buy this again. I like how it sprays out, but not a fan of how it put little brown spots all over my body. It took me 3 weeks to exfoliate this crap sucks.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, because I am too afraid to go into the tanning bed. I have been spray tanned professionally once before and I had liked it, but I figured there must be a product that I can use at home to get the same effect. WELL, this is not the product to do that! Last night, I opened the packaged, shook the can of spray tan and placed it in the spray container to apply. I got my boyfriend to do it while I stood in the shower. He sprayed my backside and all I hear him say is \\&quot;Oh my God\\&quot;. I turn my head over my shoulder and my mother freakin&#x27; back is GREEN! Not bronze but GREEN!! I figured hey maybe it just looks greenish and it will turn tan after a few minutes. It was splotchy going on my skin and I patted it down and waited a while, but nope. It stayed green. I looked like the hulk. I didn&#x27;t wait too long after washing and scrubbing it off so I&#x27;m not green anymore. Maybe it was just a defective spray can I don&#x27;t know, but even if it was bronze and not hulk green I still wouldn&#x27;t buy it, because it didn&#x27;t spray on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Smells Terrible!! Comes off very streaky and takes forever to dry. Waste of $$</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I read about it in a magazine.  When it arrived I was excited to use it.  It unfortunately did not meet any of my expectations.  The first time I sprayed it came out in a big glob on my arm.  I tried to wipe it off immediately but I still had to scrub my arm and hand to get the product drip lines off.  I tried holding the sprayer farther from my body but that didn&#x27;t work.  The result was globs of product and streaks everywhere.  Once I realized the product wasn&#x27;t going to wipe off or blend I immediately hopped in the shower to wash it off.  It dripped everywhere and was a complete waste of money.  Oh, and the sprayer button broke off the first time I tried to get the tanning cartridge out.</li>
    <li> At first when I used this product I LOVED it. It does give a great color and is super easy to use. HOWEVER, when I ran out of the first cartridge and purchased another one(from sally&#x27;s),the results were totally different. Suddenly the spray was drippy streaky and cheeto orange. I have absolutlely no idea how the same product with the exact same packaging can be so different. Each cartridge I purchased after that was never even as close to the firsts quality. I ended up just buying the air flow air glow gun and using ocean brand sunless tanner with it. This is a far better product with consistant results.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly my wife absolutely loves it!!!! Wouldn&#x27;t pay for it on here when Sally Beauty supply sells refills for under 10 dollars and the starting kit for 12 dollars</li>
    <li> I am reviewing this after my very initial use of the product. I will start by saying I have been using Loreal sublime bronze wipes for about 2 years. I have visited mystic tan several times in the past and decided to treat this in a similar way. We followed the instructions but I also did some things I knew from mystic. I had my husband spray me. I showered and exfoliated prior. I put a layer of lotion on my nails and lightly on hands and feet. We put a towel down in the bathtub. Initially we did short stokes but then he just started spraying. It was easy to clean up and didn&#x27;t get too messy. I had a fine mist over some of my body so I toweled off even though it says wait 5 mins. Overall it is pretty good. More even than the wipes have been and probably a better color. I do think I need a second coat and the product says 2 light coats is better than 1 heavy. We probably did about the 12 inches away spray. I had some black streaking on my arms. With mystic that has washed off but since I wasn&#x27;t sure I rubbed it off with alcohol wipes and used the sponges to reapply to my arm in that area so the arms have slightly more streak than the rest of my body but not terrible. The black did go away but then the reapplication wasn&#x27;t perfect. I used the sponges to do my face. Hands and feet are just average but I have yet to see a fake tan that does that well with hands and feet. I will be interested to see if this is waterproof in the pool. Overall it is pretty good for the price and I think will continue to look better the more used to applying it you get.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time and I am disappointed for many reasons first of all when I am done with the spraying I figured out that it was in my nose(I did not even use it for my face)  I cleaned my nose deeply . However, it came more. then I cleaned my throat i coughed on purpose and kind of dark color came from my mouth  with my sputum. Result, What a terrible thing I am not even feeling comfortable because of that.&lt;br /&gt;Also, Only use once and the tanning spray gun is broken.( I did not even press hard )&lt;br /&gt;It does not dry quickly you really have to spend time on it&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to apply because when you spray close it is much when you go little far it is not even painting/spraying ( I am saying, for the first time so it was hard for me to apply and I will not spend my whole time with this product again ) also what makes me feel uncomfortable about it&lt;br /&gt;it includes cancer contains constructive things. Result, I am sending back the product.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product today from Sally Beauty.  The applicator is just light weight plastic, real simple.  The cartridge is big and light also.  Shake it, and spray.  I was impressed at how evenly it applied.  If you spray too close it gets blotchy, but it&#x27;s easy to spray far enough away.  Also you can see where it goes, it leaves a beautiful bronze color.  My only problem was that I couldn&#x27;t spray my back, so I got some help from another person.  Other than the LOVE this! It hasn&#x27;t developed yet, so I can&#x27;t review the results, but so far awesome!  It says not to shower for at least 8 hours, and it will continue to develop for a while.  Also says it should last 7-10 days which is longer than my normal spray tan so I&#x27;m pumped!!</li>
    <li> My husband had to spray ne down, but once he did I had an even beautiful tan even though we hve had 6 inches of snow here!!! I&#x27;m hooked!  Don&#x27;t do this yourself (unless you hve unusually long arms), and make sure you have a blot rag in case of any drips or mistakes.</li>
    <li> I do not like tanning outside because I&#x27;m too impatient and I wanted to be tan like every other teenager in south Ga is right now I tanned myself 8-9 days ago and I still look like I just spent 5 hours in the sun!! It&#x27;s amazing I just have to put you really should get gloves and a different sponge a bigger sponge would be good moisturize your ankles and feet they will turn orange!! If you do turn orange bleach will take it off the best!!:) make sure to hold it away from you like 12 inches or so. It will turn hair follicles brownish like blackheads at least it did on my chest and stomach... Anyways it&#x27;s an amazing buy for 12 bucks!!!!:)</li>
    <li> Did not like at all..</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time almost a year ago, and have purchased a refill a month ever since! I&#x27;ve shown it to countless girlfriends and they have all loved it. I did get ONE dud can out of the probably 15 I&#x27;ve bought. It just wouldn&#x27;t spray correctly. I&#x27;ll never damage my skin in the tanning bed again</li>
    <li> I tried this product a while back.  What I liked about this product was that it gave me an instant tan.  However, the instructions said that I had to wipe the tip of the spraying gun after every spray.  Also, I had  to protect the surrounding furnitures with newspaper, so that they wouldn&#x27;t stain, so it wasn&#x27;t too convenient for me.  Other than that, I thought this was a different tanning product that worked.  I stick with the tanning lotions though.</li>
    <li> I love it. The tan is golden brown, not orange and its easy to apply. If you lack finesse then maybe you should have someone else apply it for you. Make sure to shake as you spray, preferrably side to side as it prevents splattering, and wipe the nozzle every few sprays. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 7 years and Im kind of shocked that it has such a low review on here. Such a shame. I think its the best product on the market.</li>
    <li> great product at a fantasti prize and bargain whih arrived on time as expected!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and its absolutely amazing. The trick is having someone spray you and making sure they stand 8 inches away. Wait 8 hours shower and reapply for the best application. I love it I recommend this to everyone :) who wants a bronze tan.</li>
    <li> I was sent a defected product and was told that I would receive a refund in October and I have yet to receive one.  The package that was sent to me was cut open and taped up and the product sprayed bright green.  Thankfully, I did not apply it to my skin.  I am extremely disappointed in the product and the customer service.</li>
    <li> Read back of packaging and saw that product may cause cancer.  The purpose of my buying self tanner is to prevent cancer from the sun.  Wasted my money.</li>
    <li> People really need to understand that this product will only turn out really well if you apply it correctly. I have been using this product for 2 years now, and purchase 2 every month (1 refill cartridge lasts me 2 tans/2 weeks) at my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. I always get lots of compliments on my tanner from my friends who know that it is self tanner! Everybody else for that matter always asks me if I went on a vacation or spent time outside. From an experienced tanner and someone who doesn&#x27;t get the slightest bit of color from the sun, this product is my absolute favorite. I spent a year or two occasionally over-paying for mystic tans at my local tanning salon (For I&#x27;m only 16..) and those always turned me orange and streaky. The mystic tans were twice the price as this and last for a few days. Some tanning experiences I&#x27;ve had with mystics leave me not even wanting to go out in public!! For best results for this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally shower an hour before I apply my tanning. I scrub off my previous tan with a moisturizing exfoliating lotion (Dove, SoftSoap..etc). This will remove your previous tan if you have one and will exfoliate for your up-coming tan. I NEVER do self tanners without showering and moisturizing at least an hour before I apply it. After you shower and exfoliate wait one hour until you begin your self tanner. I always put a shower cap over my hair before applying... You will look silly, but trust me you don&#x27;t want it in your hair! I always tan naked to insure that I wont develop a farmers tan! I then place the cartridge in the salon bronze gun and put on 4 different applications with by 5 minute intervals between each application. I spray in a circular motion on my chest area, arms, legs, and face. MAKE SURE NOT TO PUT IT ON YOUR HANDS. Now, I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes my tanner tends to bead up with I apply it, so I always wait a minute or two and then rub it in. After each application make sure to wash your hands thoroughly to takeoff any tanner on your hands.. it will look very bad if you don&#x27;t! After you apply 4 applications remove your shower cap and normally I sit infront of a portable floor fan for atleast 15 minutes to allow the drying process to go smoothly. If you notice your tanner on your face got a little streaky and funky on ya in the morning, just wash your face with your face wash and it will look more even, but you will lose a little color on the face.. not much though.. and nothing that a little powder make-up bronzer can&#x27;t fix! :)&lt;br /&gt;One tan application normally lasts me a full 4-5 days.. Anytime after that it starts to get a little blochy, and then that&#x27;s when I start my tanning process all over again. This product is truly amazing and I really honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it, as bad as that sounds!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product... you have to get used to it, because when you first use it, it is very weird... you get stained everywhere and it looks not very natural... but when you use it and you practice how to apply it, it looks really, really nice and very natural. But I insist you have to practice. This is not a product that you can use perfectly well your first time. I recomend it with that warning.</li>
    <li> like some other people my spray was GREEN but it actually didn&#x27;t turn my skin green. i don&#x27;t notice any tan at all actually after my first application, and i&#x27;ve waited 24 hours for it to appear. this thing isn&#x27;t that great. won&#x27;t re purchase but won&#x27;t return it either.</li>
    <li> Sprayer works really bad. It gets the product everywhere regardless of the distance, so the pressure is way too high, sprays too much of it it runs on ur skin. Even after spraying from very far 2-3 feet I still looked dirty with product running down my arms. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it. Buy a lotion or regular spray can tanning mist, will do a 100% better job than this pos</li>
    <li> My son talked me into getting this for him.  It really is a terrible product and a waste of money.  Save up your money and get a real spray tan at a salon.  These do-it-yourself products are just not reliable.</li>
    <li> This system works great - but you must follow the directions in order to get the best results.  I used it for New Year&#x27;s Eve, and I looked tanned and healthy.  If you spray on too much tanner, you can wipe or sponge it to even it out.  It looks natural and lasts longer than most self-tanners - and I have used most of the self-tanners out there.</li>
    <li> Sucks eggs. 1st attempt not good. actually very bad, 2nd attempt I had someone else apply, it didn&#x27;t help. If you don&#x27;t mind being streaked and almost orange, go for it.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It doesnt appear orange and doesnt cause streaks. If you have ever gone to a salon and went into a spray tanning machine, it is the same process after you spray the tanner onto your skin. You&#x27;re going to want to dab each area with a towel after each stroke to make sure that it doesnt run or leave spots. This is so cheap and will save me so much money on going to a salon for spray tanning!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I went to Sally&#x27;s &amp; purchased it. Very inexpensive. 13.99 for the sprayer &amp; about 9.00 for the refills. I had my daughter spray me. I instantly had a nice even dark tan. I was very impressed by the results. It lasted about 4 days. I would suggest to put some lotion on the bottom of your feet. I didn&#x27;t &amp; the bottom of my feet were very dark. But that was the only issue. I would recommend having someone else spray you to get a nice even effect. I am definitely going to start using this monthly!!</li>
    <li> Hey guys! This works so amazing when you watch a video like this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that teaches you how to do it. I tried it my first time on my own and had discolorations but the second time, my friend watched the video and sprayed me. It&#x27;s a beautiful color if you want to be tanorexic but never want wrinkles!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face, I use Famous Dave&#x27;s moisture tan lotion. It&#x27;s only about $30.</li>
    <li> I find this to be sooooo easy and fast to use....and it is the most natural looking bronzer i have ever purchased. (And that is many over the years) the trick is to shake really well between each spray....hold it a foot from your skin....do it in quick strokes and do it in a couple of sessions....i do two light coats 2 days in a row and it lasts for about 5 days.  .  I agree about the feet...wipe them after your feet dry.  I love love love it!  Take the can out and rinse it and the spray gun each time you use it so you dont get the splatter effect.  If you get splatters you can rub them to even over your skin and just be sure to soap up your hands afterward.  For the best price i buy it at sallys in the store...with coupons and my member discount...otherwise this would be pretty pricey but still cheaper than tanning beds and much better for your skin because you can supplement with real sun time.  The sallys associate told me the body builders come in and buy it and swear by it...so that is why i even tried it...and now its always going to be in my cabinet.  It does look green as a liquid but not on my skin...its a gorgeous natural bronze.  I dont do it heavy though.  Maybe that is the trick.  I say give it a try at the lower price!</li>
    <li> i love tanning and i use tons and tons of tanning lotions sprays trust me i know what im talking about when it comes to the PERFECT tanning products! Now im not saying it was a bad purchase it was nice but it you need to know how to actually know how to apply it, b/c if you do apply it wrong and quick it will show if you took your time with it or not. it does run out quick so that&#x27;s the default!  Another thing is that you have to be super careful with the airbrush gun (if thats what is called) mine fell on the floor and broke so i cant really use it anymore so there was that. Showering it does stay on for a week so that great! and it smells good which is a PLUS! i would recommend this product to people who have patience, it does work nice!!! but my all time fav self tanner has to be FAKEBAKE</li>
    <li> I have been going tanning for a while now , its getting a little pricey so I was looking for an alternative . I bought this system and I had a professional spray tanner,put it on me . It sprayed on green . So I stood in the shower an hour thinking it might turn,brown . NO IT DIDN&#x27;T . don&#x27;t,waste,your money seriously this product sucks</li>
    <li> Green spray isn&#x27;t tan spray and that&#x27;s all I have to say. Very dissapointing product that had good reviews here.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best sunless tanning sprays I have ever had! I have overpaid in the past on tanning salons, and other expensive lotions, wipes and sprays! This is better  then the spray tans at the salons! Looks natural, not orangey and doesn&#x27;t streak if you spray it correctly! I get 3 tans out of one can.... I have naturally olive color skin so one use is good for a week on me! Trust me, at this price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Well I just bought this self tanner at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and I must say, I was a little skeptical but it turned nice and brinze. I&#x27;m not sure what you people are talking about a green product, are you buying it from eBay or something?? Quit trying to save a buck and go to Sally&#x27;s! It can be a little messy so follow directions as states, make sure to moisturizer elbows, knees, and feet..I use Vaseline to keep from getting to dark in those areas. But the color is pretty nice! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The color is good, but that&#x27;s it. It really does not last more than 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for the poor review is the actual spray nozzle and \\&quot;spray gun\\&quot;. The &#x27;gun&#x27; is just a holder, it does not actually have its own nozzle. The product - even after shaking for literally minutes - does not come out even. It will either come out in large droplets or in a very fine mist with almost no color. Therefore, it&#x27;s all but impossible to get an even coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the nozzle actually put out a fine mist all of the time, it would be worth the low price. But I used the entire can in one application that lasted maybe 2 days because it was impossible to get an even coating. Try something else.</li>
    <li> Bought this because my friend swore it was great. I had my boyfriend apply it in the shower it applied terribly the nozzle is terrible and it came out watery and kept running everytime we sprayed. To get my entire body what I thought was evenly it took an entire cartridge. I waited 24 hrs and saw I was spotty. If it sprayed correctly I would like it. I had to also rub most of it in lightly with a paper towel bc i was covered in dripping brown liquid.Be careful when spraying ur feet I didn&#x27;t put much on them and they still came out blotchy orange. You are literally paying for a plastic gun that pushes on the nozzle of the bottle to get it to come out and the tanner. This is not something u can spray by yourself. Make sure you do it in the tub bc it is messy but washes off without a problem. Also it has that typical self tanner smell which I don&#x27;t mind but some people do. It will stain your nails so be careful with them. The spots that were even looked pretty nice but that&#x27;s the difficult part about this stuff is getting even coverage.</li>
    <li> I am a professional airbrush makeup artist so when I seen this product, I figured \\&quot;piece of cake\\&quot; this should be easy for me to use...so went to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok where should I start....I bought this at Sallys Beauty Supply after reading decent reviews.  OMG MISTAKE!! I followed the directions exactly....and I am so embarassed by the ugly results.&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed myself in the shower...here is what happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands and both my feet from ankle down are BRIGHT ORANGE!  I have blotches everywhere and my legs didnt even get any color whatsoever...the reason...because every thing I sprayed on my legs.. LANDED ON MY FEET INSTEAD!! UGH!!  It came out all messy, with drops of green product all over me. I had to continue to put down the gun, blot everything and try to continue. I can tell you most of my product went on my shower walls which is a waste of money as well.  I have used numerous spray tan products, sunless tanning products and indoor products...never in my LIFE have I been EMBARASSED TO LEAVE MY HOUSE!! UGH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING...DO NOT USE THE ENTIRE BOTTLE IN ONE USE!!  Another handy tip that would have been useful.....YESTERDAY!! NO THE DIRECTIONS DID NOT TELL YOU THIS EITHER.....I will never EVER try this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know it is supposed to last 7-10 days....its gonna be a LONG WEEK. Again...totally embarassing. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> What a terrible mess!! Non-stop dripping and spit spraying all over the place (PAPER TOWELS ARE A MUST).. I&#x27;ve used several spray tans and this by far is the worst mess for very little results. Plus, one bottle barely completes a single layer of coverage for a 5&#x27;6\\&quot; and 133 pound body. HA I&#x27;m thinking the people that gave the 5Star reviews were paid! Banana Boat Sunless Tanning Spray, Citrus Mist is a much better product by far and you can easily buy it from Walmart for around 6.50 online... Just sayin!! Good luck :)</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to buy Salon Bronze buy it from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply in your local area. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve always bought mine. It has never been green LOL You&#x27;re buying fake products for way more money. The system is only 11.00 and some change at Sallys. The cartridges are 9 something. This stuff is good for the price but the catridges do run out very fast,the tan doesn&#x27;t last long,and it is very messy. Will have your floors and walls dark brown and nasty. And your feet will be super brown and ew on the bottom. But for a quick cheap tan it is ok</li>
