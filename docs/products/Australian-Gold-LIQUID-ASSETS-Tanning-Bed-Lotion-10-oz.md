      <li>Lotion does smell amazing; however, it is definitely not one that has made me get that shade darker.  </li>

      <li>Really?  </li>
      <li>absolutely just like what you get in salon.</li>
      <li>I really like using this tanning lotion before getting into the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>Its the real deal.</li>
      <li>It really did smell like grapefruit/champagne</li>
      <li>It smells grate and has given me a beautiful bronze glow that had always been difficult to achieve for me.  </li>
      <li>Australian Gold has taken good care of my sensitive, hard to tan skin.</li>

      <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate!</li>
      <li>Got it for less than half of that here and have loved using it.</li>
      <li>was seems to be a pleasant smell when applied, but after tanning it is a weird smell that I do not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t stand sleeping or wearing all day, must wash off after.</li>
      <li>You get dark fast!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it 3 times, hoping that I needed to use less/rub it in more, but nothing helped with the orange tone it left behind.</li>

<li> Plus I am not sure this liquid assests was new.</li>
<li> Works like an instant bronzer tanning lotion minus all the streaks and orange skin!</li>
<li> Other than that, it is one I would recommend to others and will buy again.</li>
<li> It will give you a dramatic result very quickly but if you don&#x27;t apply it thin and evenly you&#x27;ll see spots.</li>
<li> so much less the cost</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other bronzers in the past and did not have this problem, although I believe I bought them at a salon.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not sure about the smell.  </li>
<li> I saw a little color afterwards, but nothing dramatic.</li>
<li> My base builder was black and now the liquid assets.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a bad after smell like some do.</li>
<li> I like to use something that has a bronzer in it to help with base color and not having to spend a lot of time in the tanning bed</li>
<li> and I hate tingling products.</li>

    <li> awesome tanning lotion, with awesome bronzers. gives a very good looking color after just a few uses. although, i&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell.</li>
    <li> The ATO is sooo bad with this one! I think I will go back to Precious Metals, the color was good and there was NOT an ATO !! Plus I am not sure this liquid assests was new.</li>
    <li> The best on the market!  Great pricing too :)</li>
    <li> Smells great! I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate!</li>
    <li> Its the real deal. Quality product.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works like an instant bronzer tanning lotion minus all the streaks and orange skin! I just ordered my second bottle from this distributor!</li>
    <li> I have gotten the tan I wanted in just a short period of time!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for someone. They loved it and the price is way better than at the store</li>
    <li> The Liquid Assets is one of the best tanning lotions that I have used and I have been tanning for over 25 yrs. It really brings out the great color your looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Awesome scent and works well for indoor or outdoor tanning. Doesn&#x27;t make you orange, just a natural looking tan :)</li>
    <li> I only use this product at the tanning salon, one thing I have noticed is that is not orange or streaky.  It does not come off on my clothes.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as advertised! Great buy! Thank you</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time at my local tanning salon!!! It&#x27;s amazing! Great smell! And literally even after 5 hours, there is still no burnt skin smell!!! Cannot rave about this product enough</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion!!!!!! Great price! At the salon its 100.00! Really?  I refuse to pay that much money for any type of lotion!! I have to say austalian gold out did themselves  with this lotion. You get dark fast! Smells good!  I noticed results after using 2x people were asking how i got so dark so fast. I also used the Australian  gold D force intensifirer, i think thats what its called. Is wonderful  as well.!!! Highly  recommend these products! !</li>
    <li> I love it...I will not write reviews in the future..what is this that you have to have so many words. I love it..that&#x27;s it..</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this lotion. I would recommend and buy again...from Amazon that is. The tanning salon wanted $90 for this &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t get that great of a tan</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to me and told me to buy it in Amazon bc in the salons it&#x27;s way more.  it&#x27;s ok.  I like the bronzing factor but I&#x27;m not sure about the smell.  it&#x27;s not an overwhelming coconut smell like most lotions but it&#x27;s defiantly not the greatest.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product when buying from a salon, but the one I got from Amazon made me orange. I&#x27;ve tried it 3 times, hoping that I needed to use less/rub it in more, but nothing helped with the orange tone it left behind. I&#x27;ve used other bronzers in the past and did not have this problem, although I believe I bought them at a salon. I also can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
    <li> I liked this lotion quite a bit. The color was lovely. The scent was a bit too overwhelming for me. It really did smell like grapefruit/champagne but it lasted quite a while even after tanning. Other than that, it is one I would recommend to others and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Lotion does smell amazing; however, it is definitely not one that has made me get that shade darker.  I have used others that have a &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; within and will go back to using those.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  I wasn&#x27;t about to pay almost $100 at the tanning salon for this product.  Got it for less than half of that here and have loved using it.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell and it&#x27;s really creamy. So far it&#x27;s helping me get a nice golden tan! Tanning salon wanted $89 for bottle!!!</li>
    <li> It is good for a bronzer and tanning, very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Has was seems to be a pleasant smell when applied, but after tanning it is a weird smell that I do not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t stand sleeping or wearing all day, must wash off after.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell of this product at all.  Good tanning results but bad smell.</li>
    <li> Super yummy smelling lotion an got me tan, it does it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
    <li> Loved this product much cheaper through amazon and was legit and sealed good and got me dark</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this on amazon. It smells so good, love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Love the deep bronze color it gives you and it smells amazing. Also leaves your skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I really like using this tanning lotion before getting into the tanning bed. I find the smell to be really pleasant. Good price too!</li>
    <li> This product is great. It does the job. Custom service is too.</li>
    <li> Love it definitely the real product</li>
    <li> Scent--Love the smell! According to the description it&#x27;s sparkling mimosa, idk what that&#x27;s supposed to be, but it smells great. Plus it still smells good after you tan.&lt;br /&gt;Results--Eh, it&#x27;s so so. I saw a little color afterwards, but nothing dramatic.</li>
    <li> absolutely just like what you get in salon. so much less the cost... love this lotion</li>
    <li> very very good!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet. So far it smells good. I like to use something that has a bronzer in it to help with base color and not having to spend a lot of time in the tanning bed and I hate tingling products. We will see how well it works.</li>
    <li> I Love this lotion! It smells grate and has given me a beautiful bronze glow that had always been difficult to achieve for me.  Australian Gold has taken good care of my sensitive, hard to tan skin. My base builder was black and now the liquid assets. My tan extender/all over moisturizer is  forever after, also by Australian Gold. Once again very pleased with this product, I highly recommend Australian Gold Liquid Assets,  and would say any of there products are worth a shot.</li>
    <li> Great bronzers, legs are always the slowest to tan and this lotion caught them up to the rest of me immediately.  Smells lovely and leaves my skin silky smooth and soft!  Would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Got it pretty quick and I do like it.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a bad after smell like some do.</li>

    <li> Very nice lotion. Liked it very much.</li>
    <li> GREAT price...works awesome. LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Purchased at a great price</li>
