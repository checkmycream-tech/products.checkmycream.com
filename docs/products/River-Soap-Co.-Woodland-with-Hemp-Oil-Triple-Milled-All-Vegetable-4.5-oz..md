    <li> Bought this from Whole Foods for about $4.     The packaging says it&#x27;s all-vegetable based and is a milled soap, although it includes no ingredients list. I would have preferred to see one, so that I could rate the ingredients on Skin Deep […] (where I also found out that the Whole Foods 365 shampoos were rated 4 on the 1-10 hazard scale; ouch).     I rate it a 4 because I don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are within it. But the soap did not dry out my skin like ones that have detergent in it. I assume what keeps the hold is castile soap (olive based) or vegetable glycerin, natural byproducts. (Would likely rate a 1, maybe 2 on the Skin Deep database).    The smell is excellent; I chose this one over River Soap Company&#x27;s sandalwood scent, my second choice. It&#x27;s a wonderful woody like smell. All of the River Soap Company bars that I smelled at Whole Foods smell exactly like their labels.    The soap lightly exfoliates as the bar withers down as I shower. (Sometimes the grains may scratch a bit more than comfortable, but it&#x27;s not terrible.) I could use it all over my body, even in delicate areas, and I feel no irritation at all.    I would purchase this soap again. I appreciate their light packaging (just recyclable cardboard), as shown, right off the shelf. I checked out their website... seems ethical. I love the scent; lingers in my bathroom. The soap doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin nor does it irritate it.

    <li> If you tired of the chemicals in most store brand soaps.... get back to natural triple milled soap  from The River soap company. Superior products, fast shipping and low prices for the product  they sell... It&#x27;s so good if I didn&#x27;t already have a Great job... I would apply there.  It would be easy to sell very high quality products from this company...( and they are vegan ).  But for now I will just keep using them...  [[ASIN:B0010ODRJ6 River Soap Co. Woodland Soap Triple Milled All Vegetable 4.5 oz.]]  try them all....  Tim Downey</li>
    <li> Love the scent of the soap.  It has a bit of exfoliant in it so it works great as a substitute for lava.  Its also great as an everyday bath soap.</li>
    <li> The standard by which all soap shall be measured.  Once stocked by Whole Foods, I&#x27;ve been enjoying it on and off for about 8 years. Great for men and women alike.</li>
    <li> Favorite soap for many years. Excellent scent and hemp seed oil benefits. Made in Cali &amp; great service. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I live in Maine.  I&#x27;m importing soap from the other side of the continent.  I think that says enough.</li>
    <li> This soap smells awesome and is made of quality ingredients...it lathers up nicely and does a great job of getting your skin clean.</li>
    <li> I love these soaps! Excellent quality! I&#x27;ve been buying them for many years, and I still can&#x27;t get over how good this smells. Woody and rich and deep.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It smells great, and doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores with chemicals. I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over 8 years now and it&#x27;s simply the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  Smells great, no film, and it leaves me clean.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and is great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap ever! I love the scent and that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling like there is a film when I rinse. I recommend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> My personal favorite!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome scent, awesome texture.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Your man will love this soap, and you will love the way he smells when he uses it. I&#x27;ve even borrowed it for myself at times, because it has such a great scent, and makes you feel like you are in the great outdoors.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma, however it doesn&#x27;t linger very long.  gone in an hour.  Bummer.  Bought two bars just to see.  Don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
    <li> My thoughts on this River Soap Woodland bar:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- rich lather&lt;br /&gt;- bar lasts a while&lt;br /&gt;- unique dark color&lt;br /&gt;- nice woodsy smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- scent on my skin is gone soon after I get out of the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars overall.</li>
    <li> I loved this soap but it makes a big mess of the bathtub and enclosure. Liquid soap doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. Lasts a long time for handmade natural soap. Very earthy scent. Ill buy again</li>
    <li> Love this soap ! I have been buying it for a couple of years. It lathers well ,even with our hard water, and leaves my skin soft. My son loves the Woodland scent.</li>
