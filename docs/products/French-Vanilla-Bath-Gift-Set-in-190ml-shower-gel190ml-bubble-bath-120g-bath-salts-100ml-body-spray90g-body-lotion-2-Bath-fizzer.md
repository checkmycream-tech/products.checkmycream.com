<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My sister loved it.  It was a birthday gift for her.</li>
    <li> Not sure how it looks in person. I have always been skeptical if it&#x27;s the same size that would would expect from the picture, but my mom loved it as a gift and that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> JUST AS ADVERTISED. VERY QUICK DELIVERY.</li>
    <li> Item was received damaged even though it came in a box. The spa items are in a wooden box and the box was broken along with the mirror that is on the inside of the lid.</li>
    <li> all of my gift recipients were pleased with the order received&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOB WELL DONE</li>
    <li> Very nice item. The shipping was very protected. Recommend</li>
    <li> Was going to gift to my sister. But it came all broken up.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother for Xmas gift. The box is beautiful, Freida &amp; Joe products are nice. Gift wrap also great. The scents and texture and quality are good. Very please. Would recommend this to anyone. 100% PLEASE</li>
    <li> I received the wrong package. I ordered the one that is in this picture, the jewelry box. It cost over $34. The one I received was the other one. Had two side doors and a drawer. So sad. I&#x27;m going to look up the price, and difference of items in the one I received. I&#x27;m hoping I didn&#x27;t get too screwed over. :( five stars if I had received the correct one.</li>
    <li> Loved this package.  Beautiful display, nice sized products, and the box is definitely a keeper that can be used for several things in itself.  I would recommend this for a gift for any occasion.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from my brother in law. I had to return it because I&#x27;m allergic to most vanilla scents, but that&#x27;s not why I gave it two stars. You can get the same size and quality of bath set at Walmart for a third of the price. I was appalled to learn how much he had spent on this cheap set. Minus the piece of crap pine box and the bath fizzers, you can get the same sort of gift set from Philosophy for the same price point, or maybe even a little less expensive. If you want to get a nice, truly luxury gift set for someone, go that route. This thing is so cheap it&#x27;s worth spending the money to ship it back for a return.</li>
    <li> Big hit Christmas gift.  Bought 4</li>
    <li> I am so in love with the French Vanilla Gift set.  I was shocked when I opened the box and pulled out this beautiful gift set.  This is not a small gift set it is huge!  The French vanilla scent is beautiful, the bath ball fizzers are wonderful, body lotion is wonderfully smooth, the spray is beautiful with shea butter and vitamin E, as well as the shower gel, and bath salts all with shea butter and vitamin E.  All of these beautiful scented products comes in a gorgeous jewelry box with a mirror and a drawer for all your jewelry.  I am always tentative when buying a gift on line because it is hard to tell the scent and how large the gift is (we need scratch and sniff on our computers.  I am so impressed with this magnificent gift set any lady will be impressed.  I will be giving this gift set for friends and family on their special occasions.  I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.  THANK YOU!  Hurry and get yours now.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for the wife</li>
    <li> This item was purchased for a gift.  The recipient was very pleased with the quality of this gift.  The packing was very pleasant as well as the fragrance of the items.  I choose this item because it looked so nice and different.  I am glad to have made this selection.</li>
    <li> French Vanilla Bath Gift Set in 190ml shower...&lt;br /&gt; Freida &amp; Joc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Wonderful Gift it comes beautifully boxed wrapped with a bow  Don&#x27;t get me wrong this can be a personal present..  It smells amazing not like fake Vanilla it smells like a vanilla cupcake,&lt;br /&gt;The shower gel and bubble bath smell amazing and leave your skin feeling nice and soft.  Bath salts are great for your muscles dissolve really well.and quickly, bath fizz balls are fun for all. The Lotion is a great finish to your bath or as a daily use.  My kids love the lotion they say mimi I want to smell like a French vanilla! THE BEST PART IS IT COMES WITH A GREAT WOODEN BOX WITH A MIRROR AND A DRAWER FOR USE ELSEWHERE  Enjoy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is a great choice for gifting any one for any occasion. This gift box contains-  190ml shower gel, 190ml bubble bath, 120g bath salts, 100ml body spray, 90g body lotion, 2 Bath fizzer, Maroon elegant ribbon &amp; hand tag.&lt;br /&gt;It makes for a great gift which includes a wooden box that can be used for decorative purposes and also can be used as a jewellery box. Its very good looking gift. I do wish the contents were of a little bigger size as such gift sets are available in many stores for lower cost. So at $35 i would expect a little more quantity.&lt;br /&gt;But for the whole presentation this stuff is great. The smell is also nice and mild. I was lucky to receive this at discounted or no cost for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> i bought this as a gift and it was ok she hasn&#x27;t used all the products. so that usually tells me it is a dud</li>
    <li> My Mom L:oves this and she recommends this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I liked this set, everything has a warm vanilla scent and all products are of good quality. The packaging makes this a great gift because not only are you getting a great set, but also a good wooden jewelry box. I have an in depth review on my blog: beautyobsessions3.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for Mothers&#x27; Day, and she raved about it.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, as she can be quite fussy.</li>
    <li> I had been remiss in sending a gift to my close friend to celebrate the arrival of her second child, and I’ve gotten in the habit of sending “pamper mom” items to new/repeat moms instead of baby stuff.  My friend’s favorite scent is vanilla, so I decided this would be a perfect fit!  She called me immediately upon receiving the set, and could not have been more grateful.  She told me that the box is beautiful and will house some of her jewelry.  She adores the lotion and bath products, and told me that the scent is so lovely and full that she could smell it through the package’s wrapping.  I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> It is two gifts in one.  The box is beautiful and the products look expensive.  The two gifts together make this a lasting all year gift.</li>
    <li> Shipped with broken box, otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this because the price was so reasonable, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  My wife loved the stuff inside, and the container it came in is pretty sweet.</li>
    <li> Birthday gift and it was loved</li>
    <li> My fiancee loved this impromptu gift.  All the products smell great and the box is beautiful.  I would have given 5 stars, but there were a few screws missing from the hinge on the box.  I easily replaced them, but had to take away a star for that.</li>
    <li> The product is as described and the box is of high quality.  The bath gel is not super scented, so i definitely like that.  The body spray smells great and 100ml is lot spray than i thought.  the bath salts were by far my favorite and smelled amazing.</li>
    <li> Very attractive packaging and the items included were both pleasantly fragrant and proportionally satisfying. The small chest unfortunately arrived with the hinges pulled from the frame and the contents in disarray. I attributed this to the UPS shipper and not to the seller. It was repairable albeit balsa wood is not mahogany or cedar. Otherwise I would have rated it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Awesome gift basket! Bought this for my mother on her birthday, it arrived on time and she is in love with it. She said the box is even awesome too!!</li>
    <li> Thanks very much.  My friend loved the vanilla scents!</li>
    <li> A good gift for a hard to buy for daughter.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what scent this is, but it&#x27;s not vanilla, french or otherwise.  It&#x27;s not bad, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell good either.  The case it came in is of a better quality than I expected, but the bottom drawer doesn&#x27;t shut.  Also, the packaging isn&#x27;t the best.  The plastic was torn so all the bath items were just laying around in the box.  This is a fine product, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t have paid this much for it if I&#x27;d seen it in person first.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my Mother&#x27;s birthday and she absolutely loved it.  Especially since the small chest can be reused as a jewelry box or small item storage</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift for a family member. She loved it. Its a gorgeous jewelry box and the bath products. The best part it come the day I need it. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Accurate descrptn and shpped on time! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and service..</li>
    <li> The box is really nice - I gave as a gift and she is still using the box a year later.  It looks good - I can&#x27;t comment on the stuff inside since I didn&#x27;t use it - or even smell it.  She seemed pleased about it is all I can say.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; gift...the recipient was pleased.  She said it was beautiful and the scent was heavenly.  I&#x27;d say it was a hit!</li>
    <li> Sent this as a gift for my sister. She loved the box it came wrapped in and likes the scents I chose for her. The package arrived very quickly and it arrived before her birthday. Thanks for making me look so good!</li>
    <li> granddaughter is very happy with this gift set looking for more.</li>
    <li> Got it for my sis as bday gift, after getting it from my husband on an occasion.&lt;br /&gt;Loving it to pieces, enjoying it immensely… and so does sis!&lt;br /&gt;The scents, texture and quality are so pure! The various colors, sizes and graphics are so unique! And the attractive wrapping makes it a perfect gift to any occasion!&lt;br /&gt;From now on…. FREIDA &amp; JOE products it will be for my gift recipients!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice set. delivered on time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> All I can say is it looks better in the picture then what I got. The casing is like a bald furniture and has no priming on it.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift to my real estate agent, she loves it</li>
    <li> A great gift for Christmas!</li>

    <li> I gave three of these as gifts.  All were well received, not much more for me to say.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars due to inflated ratings on Amazon, less would be unfair.</li>
    <li> Got as a Christmas gift. Arrived on time and was as pictured. My daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> My wife really liked it with no complaint</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful gift box I have ever touched in my life! It might sound a little extreme, but I am overwhelmed with the beauty of all of this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the Amazon box, I was very surprised at how this was packaged. The gift box was covered and double bubble wrapped, and in the box it was kind of sideways so that it was tight. Basically, this was not being thrown around. When I saw it on Amazon I was kind of curious as to how it was going to ship and how it was going to arrive so I was very surprised that it came in perfect condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box that is holding all of the beautiful, amazing, smelling good vanilla fragrance spa set? It turns into jewelry box when you take everything out, and the natural wood is so beautiful... I am seemingly obsessed with how beautiful the boxes, maybe it&#x27;s because red is my favorite color? I have no idea but it is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, let&#x27;s get to the spa set. the French vanilla fragrance spa set. There is so much that comes in this box, when I opened it I was in shock and awe about how much fit in it. There is shower gel, bubble bath, bath salts, body spray, lotion, and 2 bath fizzies.&lt;br /&gt;I could smell the wonderful vanilla fragrance before I even took the plastic wrap off of the gift set. The aroma was and is so spectacular, I am seriously overwhelmed with its beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that I should give this as a gift, but I CAN NOT bring myself to have anyone else touch it. I totally think that I deserve the bath that I am about to take with this amazing fizzy. I feel like I should stay in the bath for hours letting this beautiful and perfect aroma soak into my skin. And yes, I do realize that that was a little dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is amazing, its not that slimy or greasy lotion, is that awesome consistency of that just flows over your skin. I cannot wait to put this after my bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with everything else that I can possibly use in this box. I&#x27;m going to use the body spray, I&#x27;m going to use the lotion, I&#x27;m not going to use to shower gel today because I want to soak in the fizzy, I&#x27;m going to use the bath salt tomorrow, and I do believe that I will take another bath in the morning. Just so that I can say that I used everything. I have to use everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review, but I am so in love with this set!!!body spray, I&#x27;m going to use the lotion, I&#x27;m not going to use to shower gel today because I want to soak in the fizzy, I&#x27;m going to use the bath salt tomorrow, and I do believe that I will take another bath in the morning.

    <li> Item as described.  Damage to the wooden box on arrival, but everything inside was fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for a long time lady friend.  She loved it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and she loves it. It was the perfect birthday gift...</li>
    <li> Scented pretty well and she&#x27;s in the tub now enjoying.  Not a problem at all.  4 stars due to the lack of Prime available even though it says so.. it took 3 Bus Days to ship, but it did come overnight.</li>
    <li> very good will shop again</li>
    <li> I purchased this lovely box of smelly goodness in the first week of December as a Christmas gift for my sister. I was mostly concerned with the quality of the box and if it looked as nice as it does pictured here. I received it the next week, opened it up for inspection, and almost had to keep it for myself! :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box is completely gorgeous, I honestly got my money&#x27;s worth just from it itself.&lt;br /&gt;My sister loved it, and said that the products inside (Vanilla I think?)  smelled better than Bath&amp;Body Works products.</li>
    <li> Not as advertised. We didn&#x27;t have issue with the sizes, but the package didn&#x27;t include the &amp;#34;fizzers&amp;#34; as it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> My son gave this to my wife for her birthday. She has not used it, but says that it looks and smells pretty.</li>
    <li> Thanks very nice to Packag</li>
    <li> This is such an awesome gift set. The scent smells wonderful. I love all the individual items that came with this gift set. The lil drawer case that came with it is awesome! Very sturdy and compact. So glad I got this on a discounted price. I will definitely get more for gifts!</li>
    <li> Great gift set for anyone who loves vanilla!</li>
    <li> Jewelry box is not made well at shelf inside was broken, drawer was broken and it didn&#x27;t shut all the way...products are a little bigger then travel size and the body spray was leaking....</li>
