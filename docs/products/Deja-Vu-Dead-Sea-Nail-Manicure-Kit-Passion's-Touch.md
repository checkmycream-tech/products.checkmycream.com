      <li>I bought this item at a local mall and loved it so much that I searched the internet to see if I could purchase 2 more.</li>
      <li>Product much more reasonably priced than like products sold at mall kiosk.  </li>
      <li>I remember about 2 years ago I was walking through the mall with my brother and best friend and the guy at his kiosk would not leave us alone until one of us tried it, otherwise I would&#x27;ve walked right past him,</li>
      <li>the  oil is also very good just love the whole set.. if your cuticle are dry this oil leaves your cuticle very soft.</li>
      <li>Seriously one of the best presents I got.</li>
      <li>This would make a great little gift.</li>
      <li>The magic buffer leaves your nails smooth,and shiney as if you painted them with a clear coat and the shine lasts for a month.</li>
      <li>So all in all, I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>The lotion alone is worth the price.</li>
      <li>As for me, yes, the nice shiny nails upon initial use is sweeet.</li>

      <li>This product says right on its package, warning that there is: NO REFUND of this Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Will definitely purchase more products from this seller.</li>
      <li>I have old lady ridges and it makes my nails smooth without weakening them.</li>
      <li>My only suggestion to the Deja Vu company would be to sell the magic buffer separately.</li>
      <li>and if I do for a special occasion I end up using this cuticle oil after the removal to keep my nails soft.</li>
      <li>So be smart about it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too paranoid about weakening them or them not growing as fast.</li>
      <li>So its really something you have to think about.</li>
      <li>If you want to get really shiny nails like you got when the sales person did it for you</li>
      <li>otherwise you are taking too much of the nails surface off.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a quick, professional looking at home manicure.  </li>
      <li>Once I handed him my debit card, I mentioned that I spent my dinner money on that- he threw in a tub of Vanilla Bath Salts for free.</li>
      <li>i had seen this set in a Mall  and the Lotion feels so very soft and silkly.</li>
      <li>This is exactly the same product that they &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; sell in the mall.  </li>
      <li>but anyway my brother liked it so much that he bought himself one and ended getting me one as a late birthday present.</li>
      <li>ed that I am the first person to give a review of this product, so that I might warn other prospective customers:</li>
      <li>With all of this said, let me add, that I am deeply honored that I am the first person to give a review of this product, so that I might warn other prospective customers:</li>
      <li>The first step is to sand down the entire nail so if you nails are already thin this will definitely not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Use blue side of buffer and rub back and forth on top of the nail for 10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>

<li> Frustrated, I contacted the Better Business Bureau, so far I&#x27;ve gotten no refund.&lt;br</li>
<li> I bought this thinking that I could do my nails while watching TV in the evening and not have to worry about polish having to dry or cracking the next day.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re always cracking and peeling and my cuticles crack as well and are always dry.  </li>
<li> It helps my dry skin around my nails and it has helped with the health of my nails.</li>
<li> It works great for feet as well, my toe nails are the worst looking from peeling and cracking.  </li>
<li> Problem is though, if you suffer from thin nails you really shouldn&#x27;t use this product.</li>
<li> Do you really want to have thin nails for shine</li>
<li> This will leave you with partial shiny nails for quite some time.</li>
<li> A mixture of the cornmeal, cold weather and washing my hands a lot left me with dry, cracked and bleeding hands every day after work and every day after work I would cake my hands in the lotion and by morning my hands were almost back to normal.</li>
<li> His initial offer was 2 for $39.99 (usually 2 for $50).</li>
<li> I tend to bite my nails if they get past the end of my finger anyways, so I keep them short.</li>
<li> A possible cause of their disliking could be because of the heavy, heavy scents in this product, including in the nail buffer.  </li>
<li> but a bit watered down in my opinion.</li>
<li> Broken chipped nails in two weeks--and in that time I did my usual thing, no hard labor that would wear and tear on my nails.</li>
<li> Then I mentioned that money was tight, so he agreed to do 1 for $25</li>
<li> and I try not to use it too much because I was afraid of running out</li>
<li> (very slightly bleeding from what we see, but what gives??)</li>
<li> \\&quot;Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money buying this</li>
<li> \\&quot;Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money buying this product!\\&quot;       </li>
<li> He just applied the &#x27;USUAL TREATMENT&#x27; and that is the REACTION I had.</li>
<li> At the time I went to the company&#x27;s website (this past winter)</li>
<li> I contacted the company and explained what happened, that in itself was difficult enough!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wife swears by this product. She uses it daily. Will definitely purchase more products from this seller.</li>
    <li> This product is great, and the price was good at the time of my purchase. It is now considerably higher in price</li>
    <li> I bought this product at the mall and was very pleasantly surprized with the results. I have very weak nails and they grow very slowly. After using Deja Vu, my nails are stronger and grow longer. My only suggestion to the Deja Vu company would be to sell the magic buffer separately. The lotion and cuticle oil last longer than the buffer.</li>
    <li> I bought my set from my local mall. A salesman ushered me over to his kiosk and showed me the buffer block. I was really impressed with it, and he told me he would \\&quot;make me a deal.\\&quot; His initial offer was 2 for $39.99 (usually 2 for $50). Then I mentioned that money was tight, so he agreed to do 1 for $25 (yeah, it went up, but I didn&#x27;t NEED 2...). I was sold. Once I handed him my debit card, I mentioned that I spent my dinner money on that- he threw in a tub of Vanilla Bath Salts for free. So all in all, I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth. Not as cheap as amazon, but I didn&#x27;t have to pay shipping and the bath salts are $15 on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to the actual product- I love it! I&#x27;m a mom of a toddler, and I don&#x27;t have time to worry about my nails. Usually they are dirty and uncared for. I bought this thinking that I could do my nails while watching TV in the evening and not have to worry about polish having to dry or cracking the next day. After reading the instructions- you only have to use it once a month! That works great for me, because if my nails will stay as shiny and nice looking as they do tonight, I will be set! I&#x27;m not too paranoid about weakening them or them not growing as fast. That doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me. I tend to bite my nails if they get past the end of my finger anyways, so I keep them short. They don&#x27;t show all the yellowing and they just look nice. Also, you can use polish with this kit, so if I wanna do a bright red sometime, I can!</li>
    <li> To each his own, goes the saying. Some of you might find you like this product and give a good review...&lt;br /&gt; But, here is my experience with DEJA VU:&lt;br /&gt;  At our mall the salesmen are pushy in promoting the DEJA VU MANICURE KIT. Surely they must be trained into it. BEWARE of that... The salesman told us it was 29.99 for one kit. Then when I bought a kit the man sneakily influenced me into another kit. It&#x27;s a 54.99 waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The salesman buffed my daughter&#x27;s nail and put on the lotion, etc. And we dont know what happened but since then her nail looks like it&#x27;s bleeding under the surface. (very slightly bleeding from what we see, but what gives??) (It&#x27;s been six months!!). We believe either he BUFFED TOO HARD, or that it could be she an allergic reaction. And the company GIVES NO WARNING that allergic reactions might occur.&lt;br /&gt;  As for me, yes, the nice shiny nails upon initial use is sweeet. But, within two weeks of the salesman&#x27;s &#x27;TREATMENT\\&quot; my nails CHIPPED and BROKE. And it&#x27;s something my nails NEVER DO in such a manner! Be advised that the salesman did not buff my nails hard. He just applied the &#x27;USUAL TREATMENT&#x27; and that is the REACTION I had. Broken chipped nails in two weeks--and in that time I did my usual thing, no hard labor that would wear and tear on my nails. SO, I am baffled! And disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I contacted the company and explained what happened, that in itself was difficult enough! At the time I went to the company&#x27;s website (this past winter) The company DID NOT HAVE A CONTACT PHONE NUMBER. And they still might not have a telephone number in which to reach them! I had to email the company. I NEVER GOT A RESPONSE. I didnt even get a courtesy letter to acknowledge that they received my email!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Frustrated, I contacted the Better Business Bureau, so far I&#x27;ve gotten no refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  BUYERS BEWARE! This product says right on its package, warning that there is: NO REFUND of this Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  With all of this said, let me add, that I am deeply honored that I am the first person to give a review of this product, so that I might warn other prospective customers: \\&quot;Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money buying this product!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As I said, some of you might find you like this product and give a good review...&lt;br /&gt; But my daughter and I are still disappointed by our experience with DEJA VU:ed that I am the first person to give a review of this product, so that I might warn other prospective customers: \\&quot;Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money buying this product!\\&quot;       As I said, some of you might find you like this product and give a good review...   But my daughter and I are still disappointed by our experience with DEJA VU:</li>
    <li> REALLY GOOD PRODUCT . I&#x27;VE HAD THIS BEFORE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT BUT ITS JUST SO GOOD I HAD TO COME BACK FOR ANOTHER SET !</li>
    <li> This is exactly the same product that they &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; sell in the mall.  I think it is $40 in the mall &amp;#34;marked down&amp;#34; to $20 and I got it for $12 through Amazon.  Very good deal, love the hand cream and the oil!</li>
    <li> I remember about 2 years ago I was walking through the mall with my brother and best friend and the guy at his kiosk would not leave us alone until one of us tried it, otherwise I would&#x27;ve walked right past him, but anyway my brother liked it so much that he bought himself one and ended getting me one as a late birthday present. Seriously one of the best presents I got. I loved that buffer, the guy at the kiosk said I could replace the panels for free if I came in but I never did and then moved out of state and now I miss it. But beware, I keep seeing people complaining about the buffer ruining their nails and I don&#x27;t think they realize you should only be buffing your nails once a week otherwise you are taking too much of the nails surface off. So be smart about it. I still have some of the cuticle oil and I try not to use it too much because I was afraid of running out lol It helps my dry skin around my nails and it has helped with the health of my nails. I have very fragile nails so I can&#x27;t paint them and if I do for a special occasion I end up using this cuticle oil after the removal to keep my nails soft. And let me rave about the lotion! That lotion was my best friend while working at Dominos Pizza during the winter. A mixture of the cornmeal, cold weather and washing my hands a lot left me with dry, cracked and bleeding hands every day after work and every day after work I would cake my hands in the lotion and by morning my hands were almost back to normal. I&#x27;m serious, I have been wishing for the lotion since I ran out. I just now thought to look it up on amazon and was afraid it was going to be crazy expensive like the mall but it&#x27;s a bit cheaper and I plan on buying another kit this weekend. It may not be for everyone but I&#x27;m in love with this kit so I would give it a shot!</li>
    <li> This product is selling between $40-60 at most mall kiosks.  Beware!  Only $12 here at Amazon, you couldn&#x27;t beat that anywhere.  For $12 it&#x27;s definitely a steal to get a nail buffer, file, cuticle oil AND hand lotion.  A lot of hand lotions cost $12 alone, so for this product to be sold here for so cheaply it is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has worked wonders on my nails.  They&#x27;re always cracking and peeling and my cuticles crack as well and are always dry.  I found this at the mall and could not justify the price so I was happy that I Googled the product and was directed here to Amazon.  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a quick, professional looking at home manicure.  It works great for feet as well, my toe nails are the worst looking from peeling and cracking.  My nails are shiny and flawless looking, not to mention stronger as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to mention that these products are VERY heavily scented.  Anyone sensitive to body products with heavy scents should be aware that this product may not be ideal.  Please see the 1 star review that another posted about this product.  A possible cause of their disliking could be because of the heavy, heavy scents in this product, including in the nail buffer.  I think it smells wonderful, but I did not expect to be smelling floral scents while buffing and that may be a huge issue for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who does not have allergic reactions to scents.  And at this price it would make a really fantastic gift for the holidays.</li>
    <li> I like this product especially the nail oil works like a magic. I just do not like the smell of the cream because I am not fan of sweet smells but still its a real good set !</li>
    <li> My husband purchased me this kit many years ago and now I can&#x27;t be without it.  The best hand and nail care I have found.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Moisturizes my hands. The cuticle oil keeps my cuticles well oiled. Will recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for giving your nails a natural awesome shine. This is done by using a buffer with 3 simple steps. Problem is though, if you suffer from thin nails you really shouldn&#x27;t use this product. The first step is to sand down the entire nail so if you nails are already thin this will definitely not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Use blue side of buffer and rub back and forth on top of the nail for 10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Buff with gray side on top nail for 10-15 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Buff with white side on top nail for 15-20 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow this up with cuticle oil and rub into nails and finger. The first 2 steps are to be repeated every 30 days. The 3rd step states you can repeat daily. Which I would suggest to do if you want to keep your nail at maximum shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the set back is that you basically have to wait until your entire nail grows out before you can repeat steps 1 and 2. This will leave you with partial shiny nails for quite some time. It will start to look a bit awkward. Also, it does thin out your nail if you have thick nails. If you want to get really shiny nails like you got when the sales person did it for you then you would have to buff for more then 10 seconds on the first step. This will make your nail that much more thinner. So its really something you have to think about. Do you really want to have thin nails for shine you can make with nail polish?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is presented at these kiosk or Deja Vu stores as hand lotion. Its actually body lotion. Lotion that smells great but a bit watered down in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It does not work great&lt;br /&gt;Have follows same instructions as written&lt;br /&gt;But still the result is not same, bit disappointed</li>
    <li> Makes a great gift. The lotion alone is worth the price. I love the file board. I have old lady ridges and it makes my nails smooth without weakening them. I paid a lot more for this type of kit on the mall.</li>
    <li> Product much more reasonably priced than like products sold at mall kiosk.  Best cuticle treatment I&#x27;ve found.  All enclosed products worked as advertised.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> amazing grooming kit for the hand. this is a must have</li>
    <li> I bought this item at a local mall and loved it so much that I searched the internet to see if I could purchase 2 more. One for my sister and one for my daughter. The kit includes a nail file, buffer and body cream. The magic buffer leaves your nails smooth,and shiney as if you painted them with a clear coat and the shine lasts for a month. Since I have been using this product I also noticed that my nails seem to be stronger and do not break as nuch. The body cream is also a nice product, leaves your skin smooth with out a greasy feeling. I will definitley purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It was delightful to find it cheap and to receive it so quickly.  This would make a great little gift.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product. i had seen this set in a Mall  and the Lotion feels so very soft and silkly. love the scent i got this time. your skin just feels so much better when you use this lotion. the  oil is also very good just love the whole set.. if your cuticle are dry this oil leaves your cuticle very soft. I ordered it and received it by the date they said i would get it.</li>
