      <li>This scrub has done more for me than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t love it</li>
      <li>I am always pleasantly not-so-surprised because it does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
      <li>They are pretty good at getting your face clean, but this one not only cleans it has a great scrub factor too.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling nice and clean &amp; it has a mild cool-minty fresh scent that I love.</li>
      <li>really hope that Amazon sellers don&#x27;t run out of this product because I&#x27;ve yet to find a skin cleanser that feels so nice on the skin.</li>
      <li>My skin would feel fresh and clean and smooth after using it.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the soft feel and fresh healthy glow of your face.  </li>
      <li>and you just feel so fresh after.</li>
      <li>Bought for my teenager who is very conscience of her acne, she is dedicated to keeping her face clean to prevent breakouts.</li>
      <li>you start experience a tingling sensation which if you follow the instructions really makes the skin feel clean.</li>
      <li>This scrub really does clean &amp; rejuvinate your face.</li>
      <li>Most of the cleansers I&#x27;ve bought just barely have any scrub in them.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this steam facial.</li>
      <li>And I love that I only have to use it like twice a week for just a couple minutes.</li>

      <li>and it really leaves your face feeling soft and smooth afterward.</li>
      <li>Not dry, not oily, just fresh and clean with no tightness.</li>
      <li>Easy to use--you leave it on your face for only one minute--</li>
      <li>This leaves my skin smooth and not irritated at all; sure it is a little bit red after I come out of the shower, but after putting on a mild moisturizer, the redness is gone.     </li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve been to a spa right after coming out of the shower and for the rest of the day my face feel very soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>You can really feel it clearing out your skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about what I use on my skin</li>
      <li>I use it in the shower after I shave, and it has really reduced the amount of in-grown whiskers I get after shaving.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>This thing really gets the job done.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it per se, but it doesn&#x27;t smell great and the whole thing with the steam seems like a whole bunch of hooey.</li>
      <li>Much, much better than any of the other Clean &amp; Clear facial products in terms of results</li>
      <li>I dont particularly have problem skin</li>
      <li>but I love the way it scrubs off dead cells I have on my face and leaves my face feeling refreshed and smoother.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve have tried many skin care products, from high-end to inexpensive, and wasted thousands of dollars until I&#x27;ve found the ones that work for me.</li>
      <li>It left my skin soft,clean and with a really pretty, radiant glow.</li>
      <li>it makes my face feel exactly as it does when I come from a facial.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin so clear and soft after I shower.</li>
      <li>I am too old to have acne</li>
      <li>When I first started using this product my skin actually seemed to break out but after a couple uses it finally started clearing up</li>
      <li>barely have any acne now.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s not over-drying or harsh. It leaves your skin feeling nice and clean &amp; it has a mild cool-minty fresh scent that I love.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I found it on clearance at a local store. It makes you feel like you&#x27;ve just had a facial at a spa. This scrub really does clean &amp; rejuvinate your face. Most of the cleansers I&#x27;ve bought just barely have any scrub in them. They are pretty good at getting your face clean, but this one not only cleans it has a great scrub factor too.</li>
    <li> Imagine our surprise and dismay when suddenly our local drug store chain no longer carried this product and we were told that it had been discontinued! I knew I could count on Amazon to have it in stock . . . and stock up we did, purchasing four tubes of it. Hopefully, this will last my daughter for a while because she doesn&#x27;t know what she could possibly find as an alternative!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe they quit selling this product, big mistake. I bought several tubes to take with me. I am too old to have acne but I love the way it scrubs off dead cells I have on my face and leaves my face feeling refreshed and smoother.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product my skin actually seemed to break out but after a couple uses it finally started clearing up and now my skin looks better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;I barely have any acne now. It left my skin soft,clean and with a really pretty, radiant glow. After a couple uses it left my skin a little dry but they recommend wearing a moisturizer afterwards any how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope that Amazon sellers don&#x27;t run out of this product because I&#x27;ve yet to find a skin cleanser that feels so nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. It&#x27;s such a shame they quit carrying it in all the stores... It did an amazing job. My skin would feel fresh and clean and smooth after using it. I&#x27;m so sad I cannot find it anywhere any longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have tried many skin care products, from high-end to inexpensive, and wasted thousands of dollars until I&#x27;ve found the ones that work for me. If I could give it a 6 star, I would; it totally delivers what it promises.  This leaves my skin smooth and not irritated at all; sure it is a little bit red after I come out of the shower, but after putting on a mild moisturizer, the redness is gone.     It is effective, inexpensive and most of all makes your skin beautiful.  Too bad, I cannot find it in stores anymore!</li>
    <li> I dont particularly have problem skin but I bought this on sale as I needed some shower face scrub. I use to go to get facials once a month, and I haven&#x27;t gone since I bought this...it makes my face feel exactly as it does when I come from a facial. It truely is a facial in a tube, I hope this product doesn&#x27;t EVER get discontinued but I&#x27;m a little fearful as I don&#x27;t see it in the stores anymore. SO don&#x27;t buy any! so I can Buy it all! MINE</li>
    <li> I have been fighting with acne for over 10 years now and I have tried everything including prescriptions from a dermatologist. This scrub has done more for me than anything I&#x27;ve tried before. Love it!</li>
    <li> Use this twice a week while you&#x27;re in the shower and your face will thank you.  Step into the warm shower.  Wet your face, open your pores.  Rub a good dollop of Steam into and all over your face.  Don&#x27;t lean hard, let the scrub work into the skin.  Now, leave it on your face while you soap the rest of your body.  STEAM will continue to work in the steamy shower.  Rinse well after a couple of minutes.  Enjoy the soft feel and fresh healthy glow of your face.  Much, much better than any of the other Clean &amp; Clear facial products in terms of results</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is the only scrub that works for me. It leaves my skin so clear and soft after I shower. And I love that I only have to use it like twice a week for just a couple minutes. You can really feel it clearing out your skin and you just feel so fresh after. And your face glows when you get out of the shower.  I am worried that they stopped making this prodcut as it is no longer on their website...  so you should probably not buy it so I can buy all the rest...</li>
    <li> This thing really gets the job done. From the moment it hits your skin you start experience a tingling sensation which if you follow the instructions really makes the skin feel clean. It does leave it a little dry but the instructions suggest you put on body cream after use anyway.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I use it in the shower after I shave, and it has really reduced the amount of in-grown whiskers I get after shaving. On top of that, my skin just feels great after using this. Not dry, not oily, just fresh and clean with no tightness.</li>
    <li> This came in a 2 pack, works great!! Bought for my teenager who is very conscience of her acne, she is dedicated to keeping her face clean to prevent breakouts. She loves this product!!</li>
    <li> Too bad this is not available.  It was an excellent product, so convenient to use in the shower, and so effective.  I miss it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Easy to use--you leave it on your face for only one minute-- and it really leaves your face feeling soft and smooth afterward. It also works well against blackheads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about what I use on my skin cause I tend to break out a lot but this product made my skin feel very soft and clean after using. Great product for exfoliating and cleaning pores.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this steam facial. I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 5 years now. Every time I forget to use it and put it into my regimen I am always pleasantly not-so-surprised because it does exactly what it is advertised to do. I feel like I&#x27;ve been to a spa right after coming out of the shower and for the rest of the day my face feel very soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> This face wash is just ok. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it per se, but it doesn&#x27;t smell great and the whole thing with the steam seems like a whole bunch of hooey. The consistency was also fairly strange. I prefer other washes, but, like I said, there&#x27;s nothing really wrong with this--I just don&#x27;t love it</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I don&#x27;t feel like it does a great job at opening my pores, but it does something. I have really tough pores so if this does something for me, it could be great for you!</li>
