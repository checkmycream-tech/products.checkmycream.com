<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try.  I recently turned 50 and want to take care of my skin as much as possible.  I have very sensitive (Irish) skin and a history of skin cancer.  The Vitamin C serum has been fantastic! I use it every morning after cleansing and toning.  I just wait a few minutes before putting on my moisturizer and sunscreen. My skin is definitely smoother and more even toned. I actually feel like I have a more youthful &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; after using it for a few weeks.  Also the customer service is wonderful! Very personal- they really want to follow up and see if you have any questions about the product. I am very happy!</li>
    <li> I love it. It definetly does reduce wrinkles. I use it day and night. I bought 2 bottles. I&#x27;m hoping that it comes on sale some time.  I would stock up on it.</li>
    <li> I really like the serum. My skin feels great and it&#x27;s goes on under my regular moisturizer just fine. The best part is my sun spots are fading. My skin tone looks more even. Yeah!</li>
    <li> I really like this vitamin C serum. It goes on nice (not greasy) and the little dropper makes it easy to apply on my fingers. I liked it so much that I ordered a different product they offer that has hyloronic acid (spelling?) and other ingredients that I can&#x27;t wait to try. This company appears to have integrity behind their products and they truly want you to have a good experience. I like that about a product/company!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing !!!! My acne, scars and dry skin have all disappeared since using the vitamin C serum !!! The results were immediate with in two days my acne was drying!! My friends noticed the difference and made me order more for them too.</li>
    <li> So far I like this &#x27;serum&#x27;, and I use that word loosely as it is a thin watery fluid.  But after receiving the instructions for use in an email from the company (nice touch), I realized it is supposed to be like that.  I actually prefer it watery since my facial routine includes the use of another serum.  Spreading it is a bit difficult as it soaks in/drys very fast.  But once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s OK.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and have already noticed my tone evening.  I look forward to other positive results over time.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I started to notice changes after 4 weeks, not the dark spots (melasma) but to my skin, it did give me a younger look.  I will buy again, but not to correct dark spots.</li>
    <li> Jennifer, the vitamin c serum works at least as well as other more expensive products. I have tried a number of other serum but for the price, Amara vitamin c gives the best value. Thanks for making a great product at such reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I tried this after using a MUCH more expensive vitamin C serum and have been very happy with the results. I use daily in the AM, after cleansing and before moisturizing and find it to be very effective.</li>
    <li> Head-to-head product reviews in women&#x27;s magazines, many by dermatologists, will tell you these ingredients are proven to help skin, and this is an easy-to-use way of getting the right amount of pure stuff.</li>
    <li> I jut started using this serum and I am liking it a lot. I was using OZ and after two weeks I was not seeing any change (perhaps too soon to define). Amara organics serum is cheaper with a normal liquid presentation that spreads easy and absorbs fast. My face is going through a lot of changes as I stopped birth control (lot of breakout and dry looking) and this product has made my face feel and look better. I wil continue to use this product as i am happy with the cost and benefits.</li>
    <li> This product is great I can see  A glow in my skin I will difinitly buy it  Again!!!!</li>
    <li> So Far So  Good !  I have noticed a tightening and smoothing  effect on my skin.  I am an esthetician and my preference for myself and my clients would always be products that contain organic natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff; can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s making a big difference to my skin, but it feels nice and has no odor or negative effects.</li>
    <li> Good product ...noticeable difference!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Affordable and effective.  I saw results quickly and I am very pleased ;)</li>
    <li> Great product!  This is the 3rd or 4th purchase of many future re-buys.</li>
    <li> Soft skin but no visible results</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 days and so far it&#x27;s helped to diminish some acne marks. It absorbs really fast. No smell and not oily. So far so good!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve used many different brands on Vitamin C on my skin and this one is the least irritating.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This appears to contribute to moisture in my skin. Having been using more expensive products previously it is difficult&lt;br /&gt;to tell the difference. What I like is a better price by far than many others</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Had some dark spots from acne, and they seem to be lightening faster after using this serum.</li>
    <li> Really nice. Feel skin smoothing when using, but its too liquidly. :(</li>
    <li> I am happy to say that I am well satisfied with my vitamin C serum thus far. I have been using it for over 3 weeks now. In the past couple of weeks I traveled to Southeast Asia. I brought the serum with me as protection from UV rays and to hydrate my skin. As you might know, the air in the major cities in the SE isn&#x27;t that great. I thought the serum helped in keeping my face soft and healthy with 5 drops a day! I look forward to getting more in the future.</li>
    <li> This serum feels wonderful on my face.  The texture of my skin has improved and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I can definitely see a difference in my skin after using it for a few weeks! My pores are smaller and my skin tighter. Even had someone ask me what I am using on my skin because it &amp;#34;looks great!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This serum is a concentrated delivery system for the highest form of active bioavailable Vitamin C, suspended in a concentrated base of pure vegan hyaluronic acid, for beautiful skin.  am happy to say that I am well satisfied with my vitamin C serum thus far. I have been using it for over 3 weeks now. It goes on nice (not greasy) and the little dropper makes it easy to apply on my fingers.  This serum repairs skin on a molecular level to erase fine lines and wrinkles,Stimulates collagen for firmer, smoother skin,Speeds up skin cell turnover to fade brown spots, discoloration, and acne scars,Improves texture and tone for a smoother, softer, more radiant complexion, and it also Unclogs pores to clear up acne and prevent future breakouts. Now that is an amazing and powerful serum to do all that for your skin. This serum is so easy to use. All you have to do is apply a small amount of serum with fingertips to entire face, neck, and décolletage after cleansing and toning. Allow to dry. Follow with a moisturizer. Apply at night and use sunscreen daily as retinol increases sun sensitivity. For first time users, apply every other night for first few weeks until skin adjusts.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this!! I have a love affair with HA serums and wanted to gift one to my sister in law, who is vegan. I found this one and gave it to her- SHE LOVES IT! The packaging is nice, the price is great and she is so happy to have an HA serum that she feels good about AND that she sees a difference with!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for approx. 6 months and have seen a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. It goes on sticky, but drys to a non-sticky finish with a minute or so. Great product!</li>
    <li> I started using the Vitamin C Serum on a daily basis in the mornings, and then I use it in the evening when I use the Derma Roller by Diva d’or.  I’ve seen a brightness and lift in my complexion and have recommended this to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also greatly appreciated the email I received from Arama Organics with the appropriate “how-to’s”.  It just showed that they were caring and concerned that I was using the product properly, and for my greatest benefit.</li>
    <li> I am 28. I do have the beginnings of fine lines and some variation in skin tone. I have been using it for 4 months and following a rigorous skin-care routine. It is just not working. So very sad. Maybe I need to use Retinol instead of this.</li>
    <li> Super light serum that absorbs in seconds upon application. You have to use it for at least 60 days (2 bottles) to notice the full results, but this is the closest you will get to a more natural way to heal dark spots. Way more affordable than those creams which promise results that do not come! I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another side note is the seller is very prompt, personal and will reach out personally for all problems/concerns or for general advice. I formed a great relationship with them and very happy to be a customer. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I use this nightly, and I feel like it brightens my skin and helps with fine wrinkles. I put it on after gently cleansing and then use a thick natural lotion over it. I really like this because it is natural, and priced affordable</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is very lightweight and helps to tone and tighten my skin.  It comes in dropper form so I can dispense  the right amount.  It&#x27;s organic with vitamin C and E so it&#x27;s natural and healthy for my skin.  The Amara Organics products that I have tried so far have all been quality natural skin care.</li>
    <li> I am not seeing any remarkable changes yet, but it does seem to brighten up the whole tone of the skin a bit. It absorbs quickly and  completely, which helps when in a hurry.</li>
    <li> ive been using this serum in combination with jojoba oil, rosehip seed oil and essential oils for my face. I have noticed a markedly difference in the texture of my skin and the tone. I am really happy with the results this far, and plan to continue use due to its positive effects on my skin. Skin is softened and looks all around healthier!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. Will be buying again! Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum. I feel it has evened out my skin tone and has made my skin feel and look healthier. The longer I have used it the more pleased I have become with this product. By that, I mean it may take the second bottle before you start to notice a difference. I have purchased several bottles and plan to continue using this product indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I changed my cleansing routine about 3 months ago and am surprised and thrilled at the changes I&#x27;ve seen. I combine the Amara serum with Olay regenerist daily moisturizer and then use the Derma E overnight peel. Wrinkles are less visible, skin discolorations have faded, my skin seems brighter and has more color. I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s and this routine seems to have taken 10 years off my appearance.</li>
    <li> Only been using this product for a week. So far I haven&#x27;t seen a diffference yet. Hopefully after using this product over time I will see results. Very easy to use though</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the 5 star ratings.  This product was nothing spectacular and I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin after use.</li>
    <li> Great product! Healthy, brighter skin!</li>
    <li> Amazing serum! I love that it&#x27;s easy to apply and really makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakout either.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I have used it faithfully for two weeks and have seen no improvement.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Great service.</li>
    <li> I used this before my wedding and loved it so much I bought it for my sister and mother as well.  Lightweight, you can put it on moments before your makeup and it soaks right in.  Totally noticeable difference in pores and general glow.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product definitely tightens the skin and gives it a glow. It must be repeated daily for this effect.</li>
    <li> The product is very good.  I apply it after washing and toning the face, and it doesn&#x27;t sting or cause undue redness.  It tightens, and makes my skin more bright/smooth looking.  I had melasma on my face; the combination of MSM supplements internally, and vitamin C externally has eradicated what a lot of expensive dermatologist creams and chemical peels did not.</li>
    <li> I notice a difference in my skin if I&#x27;m not using this product. I have less issues with dryness and overall my skin just looks healthier, more of a glow.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, but for this product, I will. This really works! I started using it in September. A month after, a former co-worker complimented that I looked refreshed and that my face looked bright. My kids also noticed how soft my face is. The serum also works on breakouts. Just put a drop and in a day or two, it will be gone. The bottle is about 1/2 full, but I ordered another one today.</li>
    <li> I love the way Vitamin C Serum makes my complexion look.  I am 53 years old and your product gives me a more youthful look and that makes me happy.  I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I substitue this for the Obagi 20% vitamin C serum as it costs so much less.</li>
    <li> This works and helps with my dry spots. I continue to order from them.</li>
    <li> Wish I could bathe in this stuff!!!  I&#x27;ve used this product in several areas where I have sun damaged skin (shame on me). This has made a huge difference in the texture and appearance of my skin in a very short period of time. If it weren&#x27;t so much more expensive than the competitors, I would happily give it 5 stars.  Thanks...  WOO HOO!!! I just had to look under my recommendation!</li>
    <li> Its NOT organic. Has so many ingredients that lead to skin cancer.</li>
    <li> Fine product.  No irritation to skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this product a little over a month ago. I am very happy with it. I can feel a difference in my skin. I also believe it is minimizing a wrinkle I have between my eyebrows.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love it. I am noticing some changes in my sking. Excellent product,</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I have sensitive skin, so have had to be very careful about the skin care products that I use. The Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum made such a big, positive difference to my skin.  I loved it so much that I bought another one for myself and one as a gift for a cousin who has some skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as part of my daily routine now. I&#x27;ve tried a couple other serums before, but this is the best so far!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my oldest sister and Fiance. I received a wonderful email from the seller, she gave me instructions on how to use the product effectively. I love that great customer service!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My oldest used the products and she loves it!!! and I do see great result, her face was smooth and tight, and so was her neck. She looked so great my other two oldest sister asked me to buy it for them also - so I did. I will definitely be going back for more as needed.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! I spent hundreds of dollars on skin care products each year and have to confess this is by far one of my favorite, most reasonably priced, must have product as part of my daily skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have superficially oily skin but it is really dehydrated and dry under the surface. This means my face is shiny and oily but dehydrated. Most moisturizers appears to help the surface which makes it oilier but doesn&#x27;t seem to hYdrate at a deeper level. I have struggled for years with this until I found this  product. It hydrates my skin without being oily. It soothes the dry, tight spots and  my skin looks and feel moistured and plumper in appearance. I love it!</li>
    <li> great product I was surprised to be able to feel it tightening my skin and that it lasted all day!</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C truly hydrates and minimizes my pores. It calms and soothes my skin after I apply my toner. Great every day use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with the product thus far. My skin feels&lt;br /&gt;rejuvenated and more youthful. I&#x27;m eager to see the long-term results.</li>
    <li> Wife has been using this for a month at least twice per week and has no visible improvement in her skin. She complains that her skin is dry and tight afterward but there is no actual improvement.  I bought her this for Christmas and she couldn&#x27;t wait to try it with the derma roller.  Unfortunately like many cosmetics, they are often more expensive snake oil than miracle serum.</li>
    <li> I did not notice any difference in my skin while using this product. I tried it for a few months and used most of the bottle, but I am not impressed and am unsure why this product is so highly rated. I have since found another serum that works better for my skin. This product didn&#x27;t have any negative side effects or anything, but didn&#x27;t have any positive effects either. I will not repurchase this and strongly recommend that you don&#x27;t either. There are better products on amazon for your face.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Vitamin C serum. I suffer from hyper pigmentation, so it has been a real treat. In fact my Aunt just complimented my skin the other day and I know it&#x27;s because of the serum. I am really looking forward to trying all of the other products too!</li>
    <li> Since using the serum, (which hasn&#x27;t been daily, mostly because I forget), I have noticed that my skin is clearer and my pores are a lot smaller! I can only imagine how it would be if I used it daily! Needless to say, I have been satisfied with the product so far. Thanks for checking in on me. I&#x27;ve never had a company do that for me!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the consistency because is too liquid for me.  Almost like water. No smell either and I don&#x27;t see any difference on my face.  I clarify that the company refunded my money and that I appreciate.</li>
    <li> I have been using Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum since March. It has faded my dark spots. It took several months, but it worked very well. I continue to use it religiously every morning on my face and neck. You only need to use it once a day. It is not greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin. I love it and make sure I never run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before but I really like this product. Can&#x27;t speak for long term effects, but I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and my skin feels really soft and has a glow I hadn&#x27;t noticed before. So, so far, so good! And given the cost of a lot of serums, the price is reasonable so I see myself adding it to my long term face-care and dropping a more expensive organic product that I think has less of an effect. I would recommend it and already have to some of my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My skin is absolutely beautiful.  You do not have to use a lot and it does exactly what the information on the bottle says it will do.  What really impressed me was that after I purchased the product I received an email from the company explaining to me how to use the product and they also provided me with an email address to contact them if I had any questions or problems.  How great is that!</li>
    <li> For anyone trying to keep to organic and use less or no chemicals, this is great Vitamin C serum. I use it daily and have noticed quite a change. I also have gotten compliments on my skin. Along with eating a healthy/clean diet, this makes a perfect match to keeping healthy glowing skin.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My skin has a healthier look and it is so soft now. And best of all, it&#x27;s organic. Just a few drops are enough for the whole face.</li>
    <li> It is a great product! I received compliments on my skin shortly after I had been using this product.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this serum, my skin has improved in just a few weeks with it, and I noticed a difference each day since I started, some of the brown patches on my face have also started to fade. I use this in the am and retinol in the pm. A great combo. Thank you very much for making a great product, I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum was sent to me to sample and review, and to my surprise, I found out that Amara Organics manufactures their products in the same town I live in! The Portland-Metro area thrives with healthy living, so I’m pleased to see some great beauty items coming from my hometown. Shout out, and on to the review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a not-so-secret love for skin care products that contain a lot of natural vitamins and nutrients, and my favorites have always been the ones with Vitamin C. The reason being is that it has so many benefits from topical application, such as protection from the sun’s harmful UV rays, as Vitamin C contains an antioxidant that helps protect your skin, but you should always use a moisturizer with SPF 15 or higher along with any serum/toner. Applying it to your face and body will have greater benefits than if you took the vitamin by mouth, which is why this serum is perfect.0301151627 - Edited&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this product is that the Vitamin C will help fight the aging effects we receive from sun damage and pollution, and it’s something you can wear underneath your makeup. You use a dropper to control the amount of serum you want (I use about 5 or 6 droplets), and then proceed to apply it on your face, neck and collarbone area. This serum has no scent, which is great since some other Vitamin C products I’ve used have an orange-citrus scent that can be a little overpowering, especially near the eyes. The serum dries within a few minutes, so I don’t have to wait long before applying my makeup, which is very convenient. My skin has not dried out from it or had an adverse effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I was using a Vitamin E Serum from The Body Shop which was nice for my skin, but it was more like an oil and the smell was so overpowering that I felt sick, so I was less inclined to use it (can you tell I have a thing about scents?). The Vitamin C serum also contains Vitamin E, so I don’t have to pick and choose which one to wear. After using Amara Organics, I am quite happy with its effect on my skin (less redness in my cheeks and forehead, overall smoothness), and I would repurchase again in the future. The bottle is 1 fl. oz. for $19.95, and I believe that with daily use, it would last about two months, which isn’t bad considering serums tend to be more expensive than standard moisturizers. I am glad for the opportunity to test this out!which one to wear.

    <li> noticed a bit of improvement</li>
    <li> I add this to my homemade makeup instead of vitamin E. I am very happy with it. My skin looks beautiful and the company is wonderful with following up on customer satisfaction. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Ordered it twice.  Once for a friend.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has really smoothed fine lines and makes your skin feel so soft! I  will be buying this again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle I&#x27;ve ordered. I use the serum all over my face and neck in the morning, under moisturizer with sunscreen.  I also apply it to my eyelids. It has drastically improved the texture around my eyes, making them feel softer and firmer. The serum has also helped diminish quite a sun damage line on my neck. It has also helped even out brown spots on my face as well.  I do love this product and will continue to use it daily.</li>
    <li> Nice on face, howerver, I have not really noticed any difference using it.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this product a lot!  It goes on easily and absorbs quickly leaving no residue.  My skin feels smoother and looks better after using it for a week.  Great customer service and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Roller was to harsh on my skin, I like the serum but can&#x27;t use the roller!</li>
    <li> Love this serum. I&#x27;ve used several high-end Vitamin C serums—from Obagi to Skinceuticals—and this is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and works very well. My skin feels smoother and tighter and it doesn&#x27;t have the sting that a lot of vitamin c serums have. I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my glowing skin. Will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> been using this for several months now-  I like it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;most things tend to clog my pores and break me out, sadly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but this stuff really works well- I use it after I use my derma stamp, and under my eyes and cheeks every day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tightens and brightens</li>
    <li> Gave a healthy glow to skin, brightened not necessarily whitened. Helped fade discoloration a bit.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly. Dries quickly. I keep reordering it. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping and I love this product!</li>
    <li> I have been only using this product for one week, and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference in my appearance.  Thank you so much for this wonderful product.  Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Love this serum!! My skin is brighter and looks awesome. Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I like my results when using this product and can see a difference when I have not used it in a while. I thought it would make my skin greasy but it dries fast and can be worn under makeup. I will for sure repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many products, finally, just after using this for a couple of weeks, it shows visible and excellent result!</li>
    <li> Absorbs well into the skin and feels nongreasy.  A good product which is clean!</li>
    <li> I do like this oil a lot and it feels terrific, not at all greasy.  I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;curious to see its effects over 1+ month of continued use.</li>
    <li> This did  help brighten my dull skin and also gave me nice glow. This one has Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid inside of it as well which helps the  any wrinkles if you have them. Also helps to bring the collagen back into the skin to make your face the way it once was with more elasticity  This one I did have to use a moisturizer with it because it had made my skin a little dry when I first starting using it. But it still does the job very well. They make this product in the  USA which is great we need to support our USA. Also love that they use  plant based ingredients as well in their product. They don&#x27;t do animal testing on animals which is a major plus to me.  I have received this product for free and for my unbiased opinion and my opinion is my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> Simply doesn&#x27;t work and has no value at all -- Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
    <li> Nice texture not sure if it works or not. Maybe at this stage nothing will work. Maybe they should put an age range for these products. &amp;#34;don&#x27;t buy if you are over 40 or over 50!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have heard many claims from beauty products but I have never seen results like these. I use it on my face and hands everyday and my skin glows from it. I live in Hawaii where we recently have a VOG problem (volcanic fog) and it is just as damaging to your skin as any pollution. However, with a daily application of Vitimin C and Vitmin E serum I get the antioxidants I need to neutralize that damage. I tell everyone I know about this product so I recommend it 100% to anyone thinking about buying this.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do.  I&#x27;m not a young woman and thought I would give it a try - just in case it could help.  Six months later I can say that I definitely see a reduction in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes and my face and neck appear clearer and smoother than in the past.  A number of friends commented on how my face seems smoother and younger.  I&#x27;m not sure about younger, but I definitely notice that I don&#x27;t look so tired and drawn when I see a picture of myself.  I will be using this product for a very long time.</li>
    <li> My skin looks alit smoother and clear love this product...</li>
    <li> Well, I should have written this long overdue review months ago but here I sit at the dog park with nothing to do and beautiful skin, entirely due to this product and a couple others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: silky, only 4 drops needed to cover face,  absorbs instantly, bottle lasted my hugely problematic face, back, neck,  and decollet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: immediately tightens pores (I mean really tight!),  has completely ridden my skin of cystic acne along with laura mercier skin polish a few days a week, jojoba oil for mositurizer, a very healthy eating regimene and daily work outs. I had little wrinkles forming around my eyes (I&#x27;m 25) which I attribute to doing too much to my skin in desperation over the years.  The few boxcar scars I had on my cheeks are basically gone. I truly can&#x27;t believe it.  No longer have dark circles. Years of blotchy-ness almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think this does help skin regenerate faster than it it can if you&#x27;re deficient, which initially I thought was it drying out my skin--causing it to flake. After a week of not using it and receiving my second bottle I noticed the flakyness again. I will exfoliate this away and see baby skin next week in sure.  Keep using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service: a 10! Great follow up. So easy to get on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope this company starts making soap for body,  shampoo,  and body lotion. And face wash.  I&#x27;d buy it all.  Customer for life. :) thanks guys.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because so many products on the market profess to make such huge changes and when I did my research I noticed on one particular product someone stated that it was not what it claimed to be and they suggested this one as the better choice and for significantly less money. So I thought &#x27;what the heck, I&#x27;ll try it.&amp;#34; And, I must say I truly noticed a difference with the very first use!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had blemishes in certain spots on my skin including dark circles under my eyes and some wrinkling at the corners of my eyes(crow&#x27;s feet)&lt;br /&gt;and a crease between my eyes on my forehead, and this stuff made a difference on the first use! I still see some of my blemishes, but it is noticeably clearing away. I am turning 48 this year and was really not happy with how my skin has been recently changing in the last year or two. I am so grateful for this product, this stuff is fabulous! I highly recommend it. I only use a small amount on my&lt;br /&gt;face after removing makeup and then washing and patting dry. I truly couldn&#x27;t be happier, I use it in the morning and before bed as well. The directions are on the box that it comes in and they emailed me as well to give directions for best results. I am very pleased. Thank you Amara Organics!</li>
    <li> Being a recent inductee into the Facial Serum World, I have actually sampled and tested many serums over the last month or so.  This particular serum is virtually odorless and comes in a dark container containing a clear liquid with a thinner consistency.  It applies with great ease and absorbs very quickly with fast drying time.  It does not have any greasy or sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fond this product works extremely well to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles as well as large pores.  I noticed something else about this product that I consider an added benefit...I recently had a rather nasty, stress-induced acne flareup.  After using this product twice a day for a couple days, I noticed a very significant reduction of said flareup.  After a week of using this serum the flareup is almost gone completely.  I am very pleased with this product and the visual results.</li>
    <li> i got the serum about a week ago and i have been using it once a day since and WOW!  i am very picky about what goes on my face and ordered this serum only because of the reviews .....i am so pleased with it so far as the small lines i had noticed on my cheek area are already looking better and my face looks more fresh and youthful.  of course it is understood as the hyalurunic component in the serum binds water and carries it under the skin but whatever it is i love it and hope it continues work.  i am ordering another bottle as i am planning to apply to my neck and see what it does ......very happy with the results. thanks.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and great product! Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Feels great and I truly believe it has arrested the aging in my 62 year old face.</li>
    <li> I luv using his after applied Diva d&#x27;or needle therapy. it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. and my skin feels like baby the 2nd day.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
    <li> Very good product, I can see the difference already after a few weeks of usage. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried most of the vitamin c serums out there and this one is my favorite, plus the price is right.</li>
    <li> I been using this product every night for almost a month and have not seen any improvements infact the fine lines seem to get wrose and multiply sence I been using this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great vitamin C serum.  I could feel the firming of my face after a few days.  I think what they say about Vitamin C building up the collagen in your skin, correct.  I see the skin tighter under the chin area.  The few age spots I have, seem to be fading well.  I&#x27;m now a believer.</li>
    <li> My face felt smooth the next morning and no greasiness, it even look whiter!</li>
    <li> My skin looks smoother, reduced-wrinkles and I do love how it feels as it goes on. I actually think its working!</li>
    <li> I got this product to help with some darkening of the skin on my face related to an illness I have.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know how effective it is, but the darkness has definitely lightened a very small amount in just a few weeks.  It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and helps my skin to look smoother and tighter.  I have pretty oily skin and am prone to mild congestion.  I did have a few really small breakouts on the areas of my face where I was putting a lot of this product.  So I started using it only every few days.  I think this product would be awesome for someone with dry skin.  If you have oily skin it is also a good product, as long as you exfoliate on a regular basis and don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
    <li> Honestly, when I first received the vitamin C serum, I wasn&#x27;t using it consistently (don&#x27;t know why, just didn&#x27;t.) One night last week I picked it up again because I had two large spider bites on my face (from a hiking trip in the mountains.)  Every morning and night since last week I&#x27;ve used the serum and it&#x27;s really GREAT!  The bites have almost disappeared and they don&#x27;t appear to leave a dark mark.  I really like the change I&#x27;m seeing in my skin and I attribute it to the vitamin C serum. I&#x27;m working towards being able to wear just a tiny bit of foundation on my problem areas only and just use full coverage for events only.  I believe that the vitamin C serum will get me there.  Fan for life... I have reorganized my make-up cube, so the bottle sits front and center...it&#x27;s so awesome.</li>
    <li> Seems to work, haven&#x27;t had it for long enough yet to tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. And their customer service is great!</li>
    <li> Ok, I hardly ever write reviews, but this is for those of you on fence about this product. I am  in my 60s and I have always tried to take care of myself..... and honestly, this stuff really, really works!!!  I have been using this for 2 months (just bought my 3rd bottle) and my skin is youthful, it has a glow and fine lines are about gone!!  I was at a dinner party and people were blown away when I told them my age, they had me pegged for my 40&#x27;s!! Yes, really!!  I saw a relative I hadn&#x27;t seen in awhile, and she kept asking me about my hair, what did I do, it looked good....... I have done nothing different!!! Its my complexion!! But I didn&#x27;t tell her that.... haha  I don&#x27;t represent the company, I didn&#x27;t get my product for free (darn), and I will keep purchasing!!</li>
    <li> Love the easy absorption and look of my skin!  I will repurchase</li>
    <li> Started seeing results within the first week!  My skin feels smooth and lighter.</li>
    <li> I use this serum before sun exposure and very pleased with the results. It absorbs very quickly and slightly calms the face skin. It&#x27;s also very convenient for travels.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased so far! 3 weeks I&#x27;m seeing a difference. Can&#x27;t wait for 6 months. No breakouts or irritation.</li>
    <li> Great product, with consistent use I am seeing a difference in the texture of my skin and an evening of tone. Fine lines are diminishing.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Serum did nothing for me!</li>
    <li> I love this Vit C serum. This product is very easy to use. I like mixing it with my daily moisturizer. Quality at a most reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product . I have had wonderful results in just a short time of using it. It has tightened and smoothed my face and faded sun spots and acne spots. I look healthier and hardly have to use any makeup at 55 years old. I give it a 5 star and 2 thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference since I started using this product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars for the time being because I&#x27;m still experimenting with it but so far I&#x27;m really impressed! While this was sent to me, I was still not sure how this was going to compare to the other serums that were sent to me. While the texture is alarmingly liquidy, it has been the most effective.  My skin has been more even, hydrated and softer in texture and I believe that this product is to blame ;) I should also mention that my skin is particularly sensitive to skin care even towards organic products but I still found this soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have a post out soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.lilting-grace.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> This is undoubtedly the BEST, and most effective product for face and neck applications.  An added advantage is the safe and natural organic ingredients and method of production.</li>
    <li> Using it daily for last month and no skin changes yet</li>
    <li> Loved the serum! Hydrated my without irritation and evened out my tone. My skin looked brighter and felt smooth and soft. Its a great serum for all skin types. I like that its botanically derived and the hyaluronic acid is full of antioxidants as well as vitamins c &amp; e.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true!  Have been using Vitamin C 20% serum for 10 years and I am 65 but pass for 50.  My skin is bright, even tones, tight with a few fine lines.  There are more expensive products out there with less quality ingredients so no need to pay more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda in Panama</li>
    <li> I am using this product for about 2 weeks now. I have very dry skin, especially winter time. I apply serum on cleansed skin, morning and at night. Cleanse skin, apply serum, after few minutes apply cream. It works really well for me &#x3D;) I will be ordering this serum again and again. We are exposed to elements all day, our skin needs extra help. I am glad i have found product that works for me!&lt;br /&gt;I have to be very choosey bec my skin is very finicky &amp;#62;&#x3D;( so i need to be very selective. This serum is great !!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I have been using various Vitamin C serums for several months and have been pleased with the results. I was drawn to this serum because of its plant based ingredients. I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, but as far as serums go, I am very happy with it. First of all, the other Vitamin C serums I have used are all a golden/orange/brown type color. The color disappears when you rub it into your skin, but after a while, I noticed that my white pillowcases had orangish/brown marks where my face touched the pillow. The color washed out in the laundry, but it was weird seeing the color end up on my pillows. This serum is clear so this hasn&#x27;t been an issue at all. Yay! This serum is fragrance free. One of the other serums that I used smelled like infant&#x27;s liquid vitamins. Another thing is that this serum does not sting. The other ones would sting my face on areas where I had acne or small cuts. Since I have been using Vitamin C serums regularly for a while, I have not noticed any changes in my skin with the use of this serum, so it seems to be working just as well. My skin continues to be super soft!</li>
    <li> The best stuff, my age/sun spots have all but disappeared, skin tighter, looks healthier, I use on my face, hands and few spotty areas on calves.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to tell all my friends and family&lt;br /&gt;The company was nice enough to send email explaining how to use to get the best effects and quality usage. Nice</li>
    <li> So far so good.  While I only started using this product about a month ago I believe I&#x27;m seeing good results with it.  My pore size seems smaller, my skin looks clearer and fresher and the large dark spot on my cheek seems to be getting lighter.  If things continue to improve I will be reordering the product.</li>
    <li> After just one use I noticed the lines around my lips are lessened.  The serum is light and easily applied.  It absorbs into the skin in just a minute or two.  I have had no problems with putting the serum on and following it with my moisturizer.  I am pleased with this and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this Vitamin C Serum.  I have read and seen advertisements about the effects of Vitamin C and wanted to try it.  I like that this is an organic line.  The first few days I noticed a difference in my skin.  It felt great and glowed a bit.  I looked more awake for sure.  A little goes a long way and it feels wonderful under my moisturizer.  I cant wait to see what happens after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Hello and thank you for your wonderful serum! My mother has noticed less&lt;br /&gt;wrinkles and it even helped even out her skin. It also helped fade old&lt;br /&gt;scars too. She puts a few drops in her lotion bottle.  And her skin is&lt;br /&gt;glows.  Im happy and on her behalf I say thank you very much 10/10 for&lt;br /&gt;sure!&lt;br /&gt;Warm regards from&lt;br /&gt;Mario and my mother</li>
    <li> Other than dry out my skin, this serum did absolutely nothing of any benefit.</li>
    <li> This is a really wonderful product. I&#x27;ve tried many (very expensive) vitamin C serums and haven&#x27;t been satisfied or have seen such a quick turn around as I have with Amara vitamin C serum. I&#x27;m using it conjunction with a dermaroller to treat scarring and have noticed a huge difference in just four treatments. The best part is that the ingredients are organic, vegan and cruelty free.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, prone to breakout. This vitamin c broke me out. Terribly. I would recommend Dermadoctor Kakudu Vitamin C. It is a more expensive product...but, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great product and works very well for past acne scars. I have been using it for several weeks now and I am beginning to see marks fade. Also, the company replaced my bottle right away for a minor malfunction. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Wonderful serum for reducing lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I received a small sample of this product and I love it! It goes on very smooth and smells great compared to other vitamin C serums I have tried! It did not break my skin out and it rubbed in quite easily. A small amount goes a long way so this product will last awhile.</li>
    <li> I see a small difference but overtime I can see the fine lines going away.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product, and Amazing results from the first time.</li>
    <li> Great product :D , ordered it cause im working in the desert at the moment and that is quit rough on the skin. Since ive started the serum mt skin is softer and more even. Very happy and satisfied with the product and the fast delivery. Surely buying this again.</li>
    <li> This type of serum was recommended to me by my sister. I purchased this one because of the price and I&#x27;m so happy that I did. Upon one application I noticed an immediate difference in my under eye circles, they were almost non-existent. Additionally, my skin has a beautiful glow that had gone missing for a short while. I truly recommend this product to anyone &amp; everyone, especially if you want a makeup optional face!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely re-order this product, I just pray &amp; hope that the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t change the properties or formula of this serum. Thanks Amara Organics for making such a wonderful product at such an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Reasonable price and I love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost 2 months now and I&#x27;ve been using this vitamin c serum every morning. I still have some left so 1 bottle lasts a long time. My skin looks great and I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments in the past few weeks. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting to see results this quickly so I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. My skin looks more radiant and has a smooth finish, like a creamier looking texture. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I&#x27;m definitely hooked on this serum now and will be ordering a new bottle soon.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful after reading the reviews but my skin did not respond well to this item for some reason. I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m highly sensitive to products, I&#x27;m actually not that sensitive to beauty products, I was just making a change for more natural products. Unfortunately this item irritated my skin so I cannot use it after several attempts. The company has great service with follow ups and addressing concerns. It&#x27;s not for me but it&#x27;s different for everyone, you can try it to see if it work out for you.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected. Love it, already see a difference in my skin. It looks smoother and refreshed and definitely younger. Very impressed. Also impressed with the email I received from the seller with recommendations on how to use the product. Will definitely order again from them. Happy with the service and the serum!</li>
    <li> This product has definitely changed the way my skin looks and feels. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to improve my skin but they did not work and were far harsher on my skin. I use this product after I use the derma roller for three months now and I am loving my skin!!! My cheeks are not red anymore and my skin tone is balanced. I will continue to use this product and purchase more if I run out. Remember, A little goes a long way AND it takes time to see desired results but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Results were evident within 7 days. I am very pleased, as I have ought products in the past that were costly and showed no results.</li>
    <li> I love it, the serum it is not sticky and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve use it for a month and my skin looks healthier.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and most importantly,  the product doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. I love it !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a serum before so I wasnt sure which one to buy. After looking through many different products and reading reviews, this one seemed like a winner.. And I definitely think it is! It shipped fast and I love it! The consistency is thin and applies smoothly all over. It dries fast and leaves a non greasy feeling. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really notice a reduction of fine lines yet, but I will try to use for a minimum of 6 months to see what the results may be. However, I do feel the texture and appearance of my complexion is smoother and brighter??</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome. I can totally see the difference on my face after a month of using it. I use the serum after the derma roller and both used together made my skin noticeably more radiant. Also the people who sent be the serum always ask how the product is working for me. I have never bought a product in amazon where the company or owner would care genuinely about their customers like this one.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 1 month.  I haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet.  I will keep trying the product.</li>
    <li> Long term effects not sure but I will say I have really oily skin and this is very nice because it is light and doesn&#x27;t add on to make my face feel sticky also there is no odor and a little does go a long way...i def like the after feel but I also use this with my indian clay mask which is fab</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am 50 and my younger cousins want to know my secret because I always look so young. I have been using Vitamin C serum after I wash my face for awhile. It seems to be working.</li>
    <li> make my dark spot lighter</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my skin. Draws skin tighter and gives it a nice glow. Does not decrease my crinkles though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of vitamin C serums and this one is simply great. Such high quality.</li>
    <li> Good product. I will definitely by it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about two weeks now.  It does appear to give my skin a healthy glow. It only takes a couple of drops to cover my face so one bottle should last quite a while.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product and feel it is making my skin softer and more radiant.  It does not irritate  my sensitive skin and is reasonable  priced.</li>
    <li> No improvements after using an entire bottle</li>
    <li> I have been trying seveal of these serums....came back to Amara!  noticeable difference.  also very impressed  when Jennifer sent email providing important and helpful instructions....excellent customer service...love that too!</li>
    <li> Just received my second order. Since adding this Vitamin C serum to my daily skin routine, I have noticed a positive difference in the texture and overall look of my skin. Ordering was a breeze and there is excellent customer service provided.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this serum is wonderful. It softens and feels really good! It is helping to clear up some eczema as well.</li>
    <li> Love this have seen a difference with my skin</li>
    <li> Great! Absolutely love this product! I use it everyday in the summer, definitely will be back for more . Every women needs this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product-it is relatively inexpensive (compared to other brands with the same ingredients!), and my skin actually looks and feels better after only two weeks. The product arrived quickly, as advertised, and a rep for Amara Organics actually reached out to me personally to reiterate the directions for use and thank me for the business. I will definitely be buying from this company again.</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel like silk!</li>
    <li> What can I say about this product well...I love it! It makes my skin so very soft and vibrant. I have very oily skin and it has helped keep the oil down. I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this product. So very easy to use just wash your face pat dry and apply with your fingers how very simple. I use it every time I get out of the shower. It is not oily in anyway. This is my own unbiased honest opinion and recieved it at a deeply discounted price. I will be purchasing more of this serum. Thank you</li>
    <li> made my skin feel dry</li>
    <li> Works well on my skin than any other Vitamin C Serum. So I will stick with this brand...love the results.</li>
    <li> Yep, it works. I saw a difference in only a few days. My skin is tighter. The color is consistent and I have no blotchiness anymore. The bags under my eyes are less visible.  This is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this for 8 months or more now. I actually look at least 10 years younger than I am. I kept trying to get a friend who is 70 to buy this and she didn&#x27;t believe it could help her. So, I just sent her a bottle and say, &amp;#34;Hey, try this.&amp;#34; And she cannot stop raving. Her two daughters wanted to know what she had done to get rid of her wrinkles and so she told them what she&#x27;s using. Now they want it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought a bottle for my daughter who has acne scarring. I read it could reduce scars. I will report back in a few months.</li>
    <li> Like the all natural vit c serum but especially impressed with the wonderful customer service!They really care and had bought the eye cream and wasnt totally happy with it and gave me a refund without my even asking dor one!Wonderful products and customer service!</li>
    <li> nice product.&lt;br /&gt;i like this</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 week now and my skin is much clearer and brighter. I noticed the difference after a few days. This serum is a must have and I will definitely be purchasing again. Thank you for a wonderful product Amara Organics.</li>
    <li> This product has all the right ingredients (all natural) to enhance skin clarity and soften lines.  I love it!  I use it every morning - once it dries and absorbs a little (1 minute or so), I then add moisture.  That&#x27;s it!  Skin is much brighter after a month of use.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C serum!!!! I just received my second bottle. I finished my first bottle in about 4-6 wks only because I used it mornings and nights sometimes 3 times since I love how it feels on my skin. Not only it makes my skin feels skin and radiant! It has helped lightening up my dark spots. I have melasma and freckles on my cheeks which I&#x27;ve been battling to control it. I&#x27;ve tried other vitamin c serum but some are stinging and has strong sense. Not this one! Also Amara vitamin C has all the great ingredients for skin! It has MSM, Which I love!! I&#x27;m looking forward to try other products in this skin care line!  Thank you and please continue making great products!</li>
    <li> a waste of money doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for brighter skin</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin and I have become very dependent on ProActiv, which has really harsh ingredients to fight acne.  In the past, I switched to many different products and after a few weeks my acne would come back and I had no choice but to go back to ProActiv.  These experiences were certainly a waste of money but it was my quest to find more natural products that will help my skin.  I can honestly say that I may find that Amara Organics work for my skin *knockonwood* - I have used both the serum and the moisturizer for a few weeks now and I seemed to not have any problem that I used to have when I switched products. Hopefully my skin will remain clear.  I especially like the very gentle feeling of both products when applied to my skin.  I will keep on using these products and may recommend them to my friends.  I hope that you may come up with a face cleanser too.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the Vitamin C Serum.  It has really helped my face and neck.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I made my spot a bit lighter now.  I have more compliment after using this product..I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Been using this daily since I received it.  Absorbs well, too early to know long term results yet, but know there will be Vitamin C benefits.  Happy with the company.</li>
    <li> Great product.  To clarify, I have not in ANY way been compensated for my review - no discount, no free product, nothing like that at all.  I am getting really sick of all the fake reviews on Amazon these days, so I wanted you to know that there was at least ONE 100% real review here.  This stuff definitely brightens my skin and gives it a glow.  I stopped using it for a while and almost immediately noticed the difference in my skin tone.  I have oily, sensitive skin, and a lot of products make me break out, but this does not.  I like that it&#x27;s a serum and not a cream, so it&#x27;s super light on my skin.  If you have problems with hydration and dullness, this stuff will definitely help.  I did not notice my dark spots lightening, but I have noticed that it increases my SPF protection (Vitamin C apparently will do that).  I sat outside in 92 degrees and blazing sun for a hour this weekend and only ended up with a little color, not completely red like I normally end up.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several months now and have noticed a softening around my eyes. My face feels softer and more supple. I use my toner as usual,  then apply in the morning,  under my moisturizer and SPF.  A little goes a long way. Well worth the purchase.  Swift delivery, and friendly and communicative vendor. Thanks,  Amara Organics!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin since using this. I wear it under my face lotion every morning.</li>
    <li> I really love this vitamin c serum. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to, but it actually helped my break out. My skin feels a lot smoother now too. So far I&#x27;m really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The serum works great it gives my face a natural glow and I have notice that my skin has become smoother. I hope, to see a more even tone skin as I continue to use the product.  Overall, I am satisfy with the product.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, I try the product for several months before I leave a review.  I only ordered this because they had a special of b1 get 1/2 off a second so I was curious.  While this might do what you want it to do - I have also been using Best-Selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin-- which is a much better price.  This vitamin C serum felt exactly like the Hyaluronic Acid.  I believe it gave me the same results.  I also feel the Hyaluronic Serum is silkier, smoother.  I will continue to purchase the Hyaluronic Serum because I&#x27;m very pleased with the feel of it and the results.  I did put the Vit C on every morning and after I worked out because I had a shower so I wanted to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because it does hydrate the skin and probably do what you want it to do, but because of price and comparing to Hyaluronic Serum, I will not give 5 stars  I have reviewed the Hyaluronic Serum (which I gave 5 stars, it does what I want it to do) if you want to see my input on that just look at my reviews.</li>
    <li> Like the consistency and seems to be the same as other more expensive serums. I&#x27;ve only used it a month so I can&#x27;t judge the results yet.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews on Amazon, but I had to chip in on this one. I&#x27;m 25, caucasian, combination/T-zone skin, and I&#x27;ve been struggling with an unusually fiery breakout on my forehead for over a month. I tried changing my diet, drinking more liver cleansing tea, keeping my hair off my face at night, being gentler with my cleansing regime, etc... Nothing was working! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in a fit of desperation, I looked for some products that might have a bigger impact. Found this one and thought, &amp;#34;why not, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&amp;#34; Used it in the evening after cleansing, and was pretty liberal with my application. After it &amp;#34;dried&amp;#34; I put some moisturizer over it and went to bed. Within 3 days my skin was CONSIDERABLY calmer, brighter, more even-toned, less ruddy/inflamed, and just... PRETTIER! :D I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked. After using it for a week now, I&#x27;m still noticing a gradual change in the acne, and the overall tone on the rest of my face is still gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, after looking through the ingredients, I saw that nothing was comedogenic or chemical-ish, which made me even happier knowing I was treating my body with respect. I seriously just bought like 5 more bottles, because the current discount is a steal and I wanna stock up :P</li>
    <li> This really seems to be working!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> makes the skin shiny . recommended</li>
    <li> I am delighted to have stumbled upon this fantastic line of products. It feels as though I have tried them all! This serum is light yet effectively tightens the skin with no dryness nor irritation. I can apply makeup and sunscreen with no residue nor conflict. The results (for me) came quite quickly as my friends started noticing my skin looking like I possibly had some work done - after just a week of use. I thought it was simply too early to merit the serum! But that inspired me to purchase the hyaluronic acid and the eye gel which are now part of the trifecta daily and nightly applications. And now I do see and feel results (the skeptic in me was preventing true belief). My aesthetician noticed too. I would recommend all three products to anyone who feels frustrated by costly products that really don&#x27;t produce results or arrive in such a small package you are practically forced to purchase more (or don&#x27;t and feel slighted). The Amara price points are simply unbeatable. This is written by a near 47 year old who has spent a lifetime in the sun and ocean.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I bought several for my sisters and friends, they all like it very much. I also started to use the eye gel. The product is very light with just right amount of moisture. I am happy to find it!</li>
    <li> ZERO DIFFERENCE. ZERO. These reviews are 100% false.</li>
    <li> Made my skin brighter and is very light.</li>
    <li> love this and it last a long time. my skin glows. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it</li>
    <li> Great product. My face holds moisture much better, my skin is noticeably brighter, and my age spots have faded.</li>
    <li> I am still on my first bottle of the Vit. C.  It goes on so nicely. I have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My experience has been that if you do not see any results from a skin product immediately after beginning its use it likely will not work for you no matter how long you use it. Therefore I am very pleasantly surprised to see results from the start with this product. After a week of use I have noticed that my skin feels smoother and some of my hyperpigmentation is starting to fade. Additionally, I expected some skin irritation when using this product but to my surprise there wasn&#x27;t any. So far I am impressed!</li>
    <li> I liked the product, when I used it all, I found a good Vitamin C serum at Sally&#x27;s for a lot less $</li>
    <li> Great natural product, I see the difference just after one week. Also you only need a little bit at a time, so it looks like it will last.</li>
    <li> Love the bright youthful look this has given my face. I&#x27;m about to order my second bottle!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews of many products and decided to try this one, I made a great decision! I really like it a lot and honestly can see a difference! Wrinkles really do seem to be lighter, I’m amazed. I was very skeptical but thought it was worth the try. I turn 60 next month and I am a sun lover &amp; always will be. I am Portuguese so I have been blessed with good skin but the years and sun are catching up with me &amp; I am blessed to have found Amara Organics. I like the feel and honestly do see a difference. I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> The expectation of this product far exceeds and delivers,  Saw improvement in skin and clarity immediately.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  Try it, you will love the results.</li>
    <li> Just started using this serum for a couple of weeks and I really like it. It goes on very light and absorbs very quickly in this skin. I&#x27;m expecting to continue to see great results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about 3 weeks every day in the morning as suggested in the e-mail from the company.  I think that my skin does look better and I really like how tight the skin feel after its application but I have not noticed any improvements to the dark spots or fine wrinkles nor I have received any compliments on my skin. I hope that it just needs more time so I&#x27;ll keep using it. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s not greasy or oily,  and makes my skin look and feel smooth and soft. It absorbs quickly and has no noticeable scent,  which I appreciate. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of c serums that were more expensive and didn&#x27;t work half as well as this one. This is the only c serum I use now.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product.  I use it primarily at night and I find my complexion soft and vibrant each morning.  I am noticing the diminishing of sun spots which is improving my skin tone.  I am getting compliments at work and I am recommending this product to anyone who asks what I am using on my complexion.</li>
    <li> Ventilating may not be the best word but it was the only one to come to mind to describe the sense of release in the skin cells of my face and the relief was immediate.  I have never been consistent in my skin care routine so I am beginning to use the product at age 73.  I feel hopeful that I am not starting to late to put my best face forward.  I am pleased with the initial results.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is using this serum and so far she is very pleased with the results. A little goes very far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results of the Vitamin C Serum.  My skin feels softer and fine lines are diminished.</li>
    <li> My skin feels fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Been using this for almost a month and am not noticing any change at all.  Will continue using it since I bought 2 bottles.  Will update review in another month.</li>
    <li> I wondered why the product dried on my face so quickly but was told that my skin is absorbing the serum unlike creams and lotions that sit on your face.  I like the product, so far it has helped to lighten an age spot on my temple but it hasn&#x27;t disappeared yet.</li>
    <li> I have used this serum before and I like it.  Since I have been using it more regularly I&#x27;ve noticed that my 69yo AA aging face doesn&#x27;t look as ashen, but is brighter, more alive.  I make sure I use it everyday now because of my daily sun exposure.  Nice product, nice price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and smell of this product.  It&#x27;s been three weeks since I started using this, but now I have silkier skin so I use less make up.  I am not sure if it works for my dark spot but I&#x27;m hoping it will.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> My face is so smooth and the lines appear much finer. I love the smell of this serum ... it&#x27;s thinner than a serum should be, but it still is a wonderful product. I can feel my skin tightening as it dries, which takes about a minute or so. I use it all over my face and neck as a moisturizer and then I apply my makeup. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and do intend to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this through Winter and Spring.  It&#x27;s not so light that it dries out your skin and leaves it thirsty - it&#x27;s surprisingly moisturizing!</li>
    <li> I recently got a facial and the facialist told me to stop wearing foundation and start using a vit c serum and behold, she was right! My skin has never looked better. I do think I will run through this bottle very quickly - it&#x27;s a little expensive for the amount you get, which is my only issue.&lt;br /&gt;I am very conservative with it and only use two small drops on my whole face and neck. Otherwise, great product and will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have been using it daily for the past month and notice an improvement in the darkness under my eyes as well as the overall skin on my face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 20 year old woman and I bought this product to help with my dark, puffy under eye bags.  I could feel a difference after only a few days.  The skin under my eyes now feels much less delicate.  Unfortunately, after about three weeks of application, I haven&#x27;t seen a major difference in the color of my eyes.  However, I&#x27;m going to continue to purchase this product whether I see a major change or not, as the improved texture of my eyes makes my concealer apply smoother.</li>
    <li> Great vitamin c serum...use it every morning under my moisturizer....better than a $50+ serum I tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third order already and will never change this for anything else. I wear this along with the derma e Vitamin E Skin Oil. Together, they work wonders on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for three weeks and notice a difference in my skin texture. Fine lines appear finer.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd reorder. I love the product (am and pm) because it isn&#x27;t too harsh on my face and it feels great going on. It is my product of choice after using my my derma-roller. It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or feel like you have a coating on your face. The price is right which makes it even more amazing.</li>
    <li> I like how thin the product is and seems to be absorbed quickly!  I see a definite improvement on my neck!  I have only used it a short time so will continue!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 1 year now, and I can without a doubt say it works for me.  I had line under my eyes after  using this product every morning they are completely gone. I love this product and it last forever because you use very little.  I also use it on my neck and forehead and it has helped there too!</li>
    <li> I have always swore by vitamin C internally.  I have taken vitamin C for about 30 years so I decided I would try it externally.  I did my research and felt Amara was the one I wanted to try.  I have been using it about 6 weeks, but almost immediately my skin was brighter, my cheeks rosier.  I have also seen a softening of the lines around my mouth..  I use it with the Amara hyaluronic acid serum.  Use the vitamin c first, let dry then apply hyaluronic acid, let dry, apply moisturizer.  I am 75 years old, so of course no miracles, but I am very pleased with Amara Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for a few months and am delighted with the results.  Fine lines and redness are  greatly diminished. My skin is brighter and smoother. I also use it on my hands with great results. I am 70 years old and not easily impressed. But I am impressed with this serum. A great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Did not show results as described. Several weeks of use and the product dried out my skin! Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review and feedback.  From what I understand Vitamin C serums are typically designed to brighten skin’s appearance, help cell turnover, protect skin from UV damage, and support collagen production. Basically it’s an anti-aging miracle! ;) I always take beauty claims with a grain of salt until I’ve had the chance to try out the product. In my opinion, anti-aging comes mostly from within and how you treat your body, but we’ll see….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amara Organics Vitamin C serum claims all of the above and it supposedly does all of this with the help of the highest quality Vitamin C, E, and Hyaluronic Acid.  The ingredients in this serum are natural and plant-based, as well as vegan and cruelty-free.  I always appreciate a company that produces cruelty-free products because I am such an animal lover, even though I’m guilty of purchasing from companies that probably do test on animals :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this serum is very light and not overly citrusty like I imagined.  The consistency is a bit thin, but this also means that you don’t really need to use a lot of it to cover the areas you want to cover. It’s not at all sticky and it kind of reminds me of water, in a good way. Overall, I like the consistency and scent of this serum. I honestly have seen a surprising brightness in the areas I’ve been using this. I have only been using it on my forehead because I’m starting to see signs of aging there, plus I am least sensitive on my forehead, so just in case I had a reaction, it wouldn’t be as bad. I am happy that no rashes or pimples have appeared yet. I usually have this happen within the first use,so I’m going to say this is a pretty mild serum. I will certainly update you if I notice a change. It does feel tight when I put this on, so I don’t know if that means it’s working or if it’s just causing a drying effect. I’m kind of worried about the tight feeling and I hope that in the long run, it doesn’t cause dry patches.  Honestly, the brightening effect is the only instant and noticeable result I’ve seen thus far.e dry patches.  Honestly, the brightening effect is the only instant and noticeable result I’ve seen thus far.</li>

I feel like you will love this product as much as I do. It&#x27;s perfect for my skin I have bad skin and I just love what this product does for it, Feel&#x27;s amazing on the skin as well.</li>
    <li> 55 yo male.  After 4 weeks, saw little difference.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe... just maybe lightened the dark circles under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;But, no change to wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;There may be &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; after applying, but it&#x27;s temporary.  It&#x27;s the stringent of the OJ (vitamin c) doing that.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It goes on really nicely and does not clog the pores or feel greasy. I saw a difference in the brightness in my skin and a more even tone all around. I have very sensitive skin and this product did not irritate at all. I will definitely purchase it again and again</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this and can tell a difference, however, every time I use it, I break out. I don&#x27;t crazy breakout, but I do get 2-3 large,red, big-bite looking patches on my face. So, if you choose to use, be careful! :)</li>
    <li> I use this serum for about a week. I only used it on my nose and area under eye. So it will last long. I used it under left eye but not right one for comparison. Compared to my right eye, the dark circle really become smaller. I am excited about the effect because I only used it for one week (every night). Will continue using it.</li>
    <li> It was delivered quickly and packaged well. I got an email with instructions which was helpful. I&#x27;ve tried a few other VC serums and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used. You only need a little bit to cover your face. I also use it on my neck and chest and then wipe the rest on the backs of my hands. I can see a difference after just a week. My pores are shrinking and skin tone is more even. Skin is softer and healthier looking. </li>
    <li> this is great stuff. only used it for about 2 weeks, but I do see some improvement in my face. It&#x27;s going to take a lot to get my wrinkles to shrink, but I think I will stick with this for a while</li>
    <li> This did not change my skin. I have used this religiously for at least two months and didn&#x27;t notice any skin changes. I believe that vitamin c can improve skin but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> Skin feels noticeably smoother after only a few weeks of use. Company has exhibited outstanding customer service.  This product is going in my &amp;#34;best picks&amp;#34; of the year for skin care!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product! I have seen some change in my skin, but hope to see more, since I have only been using it for one month!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. My skin is so much softer and clearer. It&#x27;s a light and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know if I liked this oe not. Kept looking in the mirror every day. I couuldn&#x27;t see any difderence. But then again I see muself everyday. My hisband an I were out thw other night to a place we hadn&#x27;t been to in about a month. A womwn we lnew walked up to us and asked me what I was doing different. She said I had a glow about me. I&#x27;m orderimg another boytle tonight!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried it for 2weeks but wrinlke does not get better&lt;br /&gt;and not enogh moistrue that keep skin good at all</li>
    <li> Even before getting the serum I got an email providing me with some information and best way for using the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself feels very nice, too soon to know if it actually does anything but my skin does feel softer and even.</li>
    <li> I have been using your Vitamin C serum for a couple weeks now and I do like&lt;br /&gt;it very much. I am starting to notice brighter skin tone and will continue&lt;br /&gt;to use it for even better results.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum has lightened my age spots and brightened my complexion!  It feels so smooth and spreads so easily over your skin. I have been using it for a year and will continue for years to come!  Thank you Amara Organics.</li>
    <li> Love using serums and the smell is amazing</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin when I use in the morning and reduces the look of fine wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My skin felt smoother even after one application.  Been applying it daily for month now and skin continues to feel supple. Have not noticed lightening of dark spots but will continue buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up - still love this product after 3 months. I&#x27;m in mid 50s with somewhat oily skin type.  Since I had no bad reaction like dry skin or acne, I now use it twice a day after cleansing, and rub off any moisture left on my finger on top of my hands.  Now my hands also feel smooth!  At this rate I&#x27;m going through one bottle a month, but no regrets.  The liquid is clear to my eyes and consistency of water, there is a slight plant like smell but it does not linger.  Dark spots -- maybe slight improvement -- but my face in general seem to have a brighter undertone.</li>
    <li> A bit too sticky for my liking.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I love it. My skin feels great and even though im just 22, you can see a difference from before using the product and after.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and my skin feels and looks great.  I am excited to see what the next few weeks and months of faithful use will bring!</li>
    <li> Literally took 5 years off my face! I&#x27;m sold! I normally don&#x27;t post reviews but I feel this product deserves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a little less than a month I can see the difference in my skin. My skin is a lot brighter and it feels great going on and for a long time after. I wear it under my moisturizer in the morning. I am glad I tried this product. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is well worth the money and I noticed a difference right away!  I was looking at a very expensive, ridiculously overpriced product and decided to just input the major ingredients into the Amazon browser and this is one of the products that it came up with.  Saved me approximately $190. over the other product sold in the malls!  You will not be dissapointed with this!</li>
    <li> I received the item promptly and found it especially thoughtful as well as helpful to get the email that showed up just after purchasing. I am not usually a fan of being contacted without solicitation by Vendors but this email was helpful in reminding me how to use the product and to feel free to ask any questions about it or it&#x27;s use :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it very easy to use, it dries fast, and it has made my skin feel so much nicer. I use Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel prior to use (I chill it in the frig and use it after washing my face in the mornings) and then the Serum followed by moisturizer. I have combo skin with a lot of redness on the lower part of my face and this seems to helping a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I luv this product! This is a second order.  Will come back for more.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is sticky like super glue. It doesn&#x27;t help reduce any wrinkles I have and is just a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick to natural oils like jojoba oil. Cheaper and more effective</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It changes the appearance of my pores and skin texture.  But, do I apply this under my acne benzoyl peroxide cream or after I applied the acne cream?  Confused.</li>
    <li> I find this serum highly effective in treating minor abrasions, minor burns, and age spots.  It&#x27;s odorless, not sticky or greasy, and easy to apply with a cotton swab or the eye dropper cap.  While a lot of products claim to fade age spots,  simple vitamin C is the best treatment.  While you can use lemon juice, this serum does not require refrigeration and has enough viscosity to stay on the affected area.  It&#x27;s a terrific product.</li>
    <li> Vitimin  C is a must in you skin care regimen. Especially  sun lovers. It&#x27;s nice and light absorbs quickly! Not sticky or shinny like some serums!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with my dermaroller. I have also seen improvements with my acne by using this. My skin doesn&#x27;t get allergic irritated or anything with this. I use it day and night :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been applying vitamin c serum to my face for the past few months and my skin has taken on a more even tone. This serum goes on smoothly and just feels nice on my skin. I use the Amara serum along with a few of their other products and am very happy with all of them. And I must mention that Jennifer from Amara Organics provides excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often but could not resist writing about this Vit C serum. After just 1 week I noticed a difference in my complexion and and fine lines! After a month my dark spots are lighter and my face and neck look firmer. I love this product and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This product seems to work better than the more expensive product I was previously using.  I see an all over evening of my skin tone.  Love the all natural ingredients. Update: still using the Amara line and love what their products do for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have literally NEVER written a review in my life and I order many products online. This product however is worth one! I am very much enjoying the product. I am 27 and have slight forehead wrinkles beginning to appear as well as acne prone and very oily skin. The serum has vastly improved all of these problems and I am very satisfied. Acne spots are fading and my skin has a glow that I have never had! Definitely will repurchase! Thanks for the great product and customer service! :)</li>
    <li> Finished my first bottle of this Vit C Serum &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with the texture of my skin. It has lighten dark spots &amp; brighten my skin. I recommend to give it a try! I&#x27;ll be ordering more &amp; wish the bottle was double the size. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Although this product feels smooth and lubricating on the skin, my face still does not hold the moisture as expected.  The product is absorbed quickly.  Since I&#x27;ve only had this product for 3 weeks, I&#x27;m hoping to see longer range results.</li>
    <li> This has helped with dismissing red blotches, age spots and sun damage.  I have received compliments on my skin recently.  I use it once daily in the morning and then apply my moisturizer over it.  I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I find this product to work very well...when I use it, I can feel my skin tightening within minutes...I like how my face feels after it drys...very soft!!</li>
    <li> I have tried several Vitamin C serums over the past year, and this one actually delivers.  The consistency is slightly thicker, and seemingly more concentrated, and my complexion has shown improvement in days.  I realize that that products don&#x27;t work the same for all of us, and that a year&#x27;s worth of using serums contributed to my results - but I am sticking with this one.  I combine it with Hyaluronic Acid and have a mini facial every night.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I will soon be celebrating my 35th birthday.  I am in a bit of denial.  I was recently introduced to Amara Organics.  They offer a Vitamin C Serum that is formulated to give you younger looking skin.  I think great skin is a way to help keep you looking youthful.  I was so excited to try out this product and see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1 oz. bottle of Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum normally retails for $39.95, but is currently on sale for $14.  This is a concentrated product, so only a little bit is needed to get results.  The serum is fortified with Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Hyaluronic Acid.  This is a specially formulated mixture that is made with high quality ingredients.  The product is said to be an alternative to more invasive procedures.  The serum is designed to reveal brighter and smoother skin, even after just one use.  I was impressed with my results.  My skin has a fresh glow after using the serum.  I can&#x27;t wait to continue to use it after time and see even more results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you use the Vitamin C Serum?  You simply wash your face.  The product is applied very thin to your face and neck area.  You can then allow the serum to absorb into your skin.  I apply moisturizer after this step.  I also then apply my foundation on top.  The product was non irritating and feels light on.  It is easy to apply and takes seconds.  It can be used twice daily.  I like that they suggest using it in the morning too because it gives you added protection from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;free sample provided for a blog review</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum and give it a 5 star. Immediately after using it for the first time, my face felt firmer, skin is smoother especially the lines on my forehead. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and I plan on buying several bottles.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I was looking for something that would make my skin less dry. This serum made my face smooth and less dry. It&#x27;s odorless and dried smoothly on my face, not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> A great product that feels light and goes on smoothly, not greasy or sticky.  A great product to wear underneath your moisturizer.  On a side note, the founder of the product freely offers advice and recommendations via email and seeks feedback weeks afterwards - customer service that exceeds expectations and almost unheard of in this day and age.  The results are wonderful so far after just 3 weeks of regular use.</li>
    <li> I love it!! My skin has definitely improved and feels very hydrated despite&lt;br /&gt;the cold weather. I will continue to use this product for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product! The winter has been extremely harsh on my skin and it&#x27;s really been looking gray and lifeless. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and the difference is insane! My skin is glowing more than it ever has, and it&#x27;s the middle of winter! I use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. It goes on so easy and is quickly absorbed into my skin. I really would recommend this product to everyone. It&#x27;s also not tested on our animal friends, which is also another plus.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I see a vast difference in my skin tone after applying. Love!</li>
    <li> This is the best serum that I tried and is for a reasonable price.  I just order a second time and am sure to order more</li>
    <li> more moisturizing And spreads easier on the face!&lt;br /&gt;Compared  to another vitamin c I have This one is more moisturizing And spreads easier on the face&lt;br /&gt;Customer service alone is superior&lt;br /&gt;Happy ;)</li>
    <li> Very nice texture. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and my skin has been clear and soft. I have has my husband start using it as well for his dirty skin.</li>
    <li> this serum feels like you just gave your face a glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;soothing and refreshing. I have seen a difference on my neck,&lt;br /&gt;after 2 weeks. I also use retinol over the  vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;Give it at least a month for even better results.&lt;br /&gt;worth the money too. Most of those commercial products that&lt;br /&gt;promise results, 90% is profit for the company and they DON&#x27;T&lt;br /&gt;WORK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a month.  I like it the way my face feels afterwards, but I still haven&#x27;t notice any significant changes in my skin in terms of less aging spots, smoother tone, etc.  Not sure though, maybe it needs more time.</li>
    <li> I tried the Vitamic C serum for 2 days and you have to wash your hands after you put the serum on your face or the acid will turn some of your jewelry.  I had a stainly steel bralace on and I looked down and under the bracklace it was black.  And the serum worked on my face for about 2 hours and the lines went right back the way they were. So if you want to try it, give it a try.  But I can not afford this for just a couple hours a days and then have to reply again.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I am getting better result than years of retinol.  I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Item received on time and in great condition! Absolutely love this product already noticed some wrinkles around my eyes disappearing and it&#x27;s only been a week!! I have dry skin and love how smooth and pure this makes my skin feel!!</li>
    <li> First time I have used this serum and I do feel a difference from the few weeks I have been using it. I use it day and night and feel my skin tighter.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s a serum, so it soaks in immediately.  I like that; I don&#x27;t like products that just sit on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;I can see improvement in my skin as well, it has more of a glow to it; like I&#x27;ve taken 10 years off.&lt;br /&gt;Really wonderful for only a few weeks of use.  I&#x27;ll be reordering when I run low!</li>
    <li> Good product, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or irritate, but smooth and soft.  Would definitely order again when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
    <li> I am 47, my skin on my face has been transformed to soft,  wrinkle reduce, brown spots faded beautiful skin. I cannot say enough about this serum. Excellent price and value. The company checks in to see how the product is working for you. I have a new face thanks to this product (:</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of the price and because it&#x27;s organic. I suppose sadly, you get what you pay for and organics don&#x27;t always work. I hate saying this because I had super high hopes for this, given that organics are usually decent and it was so cheap, but because organics are usually more expensive  it should be a red flag to everyone, which I carelessly ignored. But I just couldn&#x27;t find anything I like about it. It feels slimy and kind of greasy, I don&#x27;t care for the scent, but it did get here super quickly... so there&#x27;s that? Overall I&#x27;m really disappointed and would definitely not recommend this to anyone. Cheap organics? No such thing. Not if they&#x27;re good, anyway</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51 year-old male. I found the product easy to use and gave me noticeable results. I don&#x27;t like time-consuming products, and I really appreciate how quickly and effortlessly this is. I have been using the product daily for 3 weeks now and what I find interesting is the different things people notice.My wife says I no longer have dark spots under my eyes and my kids says less wrinkles. It&#x27;s hard for me to notice but others certainly have. I will say I did take a picture of my face at the start of this and can see a difference when I look at it. For the price and ease I will continue to purchase and recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using Amara&#x27;s Vitamin C serum for several weeks now.  My skin feels healthier, laugh lines less pronounced, and the dreaded crepe neck is beginning to look much better!  I also use Retin A, so am using the Vitamin C in the morning under my sunscreen, Retin A at night.  They also follow up with me by email for questions; great customer service!</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a different Vitamin C Serum for my face and I think I have found it.  I have used it for about month and like the results.  My daughter with occasional acne has also used it and found benefits too</li>
    <li> Ok, I love this product.  I feel my skin has improved  quite a bit since beginning to use it several weeks ago.  I feel the fine lines around my lips and on my forehead look more shallow.  Overall, I love the silkiness of my skin as well.  This is a great product, and the price tag is exactly what I am looking for... CHEAP!  Kudos to the company for getting it out quickly and making an effort to check back with me to see if I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands and this is one of the best skin serum I&#x27;ve ever had! I noticed the result within days! Love the texture and great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even think twice to purchase this item! Purchase it today and see the result within days ;) Please note : Make some changes on your lifestyle , drink plenty of water, less stress and you will see a beautiful skin!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product not sure what to expect, but i am definitely suprised at how great it makes my skin feel. I am 39 and also using the micro needle roller and applying this after and I feel like I already starting to look a little younger. My face has cleared up and i have noticed some of my pores are smaller. I will buy this agian most definitely. Very Happy.</li>
    <li> This product Is great.. Love it.. Giving it 5 stars says it all... The price is reasonable as well.. Will keep ordering it.. Would love auto delivery!💋</li>
    <li> This product came packaged so that sunlight couldn&#x27;t deterioate it and destroy its effectiveness.  I would recommend this to anyone that wanted a good Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> Great product. Have used many different kinds with much higher pricing and this is by far the best ever! , highly recommended it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews- and I have to say that I started this, a cream and a night cream all at the same time.  I&#x27;m 33, I tanned all the time unntil about 7 years ago and decided to begin taking care of my skin.  Recently, I felt like my skin was dry and that I could begin to see a few wrinkles.  I would like to nip it in the bud.&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s only been a week but there is seriously noticable difference for me.  My few breakouts have healed.  My skin is smoother, softer, and I swear my lines in my forehead are already less noticable.&lt;br /&gt;Take it for what it&#x27;s worth- I&#x27;m only a week in...but I will use this everyday and I hope that when it&#x27;s nearing the bottom of the bottle it&#x27;s worth buying another.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!  It&#x27;s worth $20 for sure!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product so I can&#x27;t confirm if it will help lighten my sun spots but I sure like how my face feels after applying it!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  It&#x27;s a great addition to my daily skin care routine. It brightens my skin and I see a difference in the texture. A+</li>
    <li> This seller really cares about her product, gave me instructions for use and checked in with me to see how I was doing. That is priceless! I am seeing a difference in my skin tone &amp; am excited to see even more improvement with longer use.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for an excellent product and customer care!</li>
    <li> This is the best Vitamin C I have found.  Reasonable price.  Tried all the others, Perricone, PTR, Kate Somerville.  All very expensive and did not produce results.  This is great.  Goes on with no oily feel.  On my second bottle!</li>
    <li> Still up in the air about this product,  not really sure if it&#x27;s helping or not,  the color of the liquid is like a milky color,  I&#x27;ve herd vitamin C seram has a short shelf life, &amp; buying stuff like this online makes me wonder if im getting what i think im getting,( I&#x27;m not sure what it should look like &amp; it has no smell, is this normal?)  This product seems to have gotten some great reviews,  but I don&#x27;t see results yet, but will finish bottle anyway &amp; see.</li>
    <li> I use this alone after my derma rolling treatments....but I also use it every day by adding just a single drop to my regular face moisturizer.  I do believe it is making a difference in how my skin looks and feels.  It&#x27;s softer, glowing, looks younger.</li>
    <li> Really great product! It came on the day promised. The seller sent a nice email describing how to use the serum the day before it arrived which was a really nice touch. After using the serum for only a couple of days, I can see tightness/firmness around my eyes and my skin feels really smooth and great! Looking forward to long term results.</li>
    <li> This is the first Vitamin C Serum I have tried and it will become something I continue to purchase.  After one week my skin appeared brighter and more youthful and redness has disappeared as well as some dark spots around my eyes.  Wears well under moisturizer and foundation.  A little goes a long way. I highly recommend giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product.  I haven&#x27;t used it for too long and its the first time I&#x27;ve used a Vitamin C Serum.  I believe I&#x27;ve seen some good results but need to use a bit longer still and sure I won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the results! Not sure if it is worth it, but great for the price compared to others on the market.</li>
    <li> Arizona&#x27;s climate is dry and after 20 years here I needed something more than a moisturizer.  This product penetrates into your skin and gives your skin a fresh, clear appearance.  A glow.  Have only used it one week and already my face has lost that blotchy, uneven look.  After I apply it, I then add my moisturizing product.  I tried this on a chance, as it was very reasonably priced.  The ingredients have no chemicals.  I will definitely buy this again.  Also, I received a notice from this company just prior to my receiving the product instructing me how to use it.  This reflects excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for over a month. I have noticed a softness to my skin as well as a even skin tone. I will continue to use it to see if some of my fine lines become less defined.&lt;br /&gt;I am quite pleased so far.</li>
    <li> Only been using it a few days and yet my skin already looks and feels younger, my wife says so.... It feels so good going on, so healing, that I just can&#x27;t wait to put it on in the morning! I am a heavy equipment mechanic / welder for the last thirty years and my skin gets a lot of abuse. This stuff is turning back the years! I bought and extra bottle for my wife and she loves it too. Couldn&#x27;t be happier and we love supporting a local company. Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> I was a little sceptical but I&#x27;m already seeing results after the first week. Starting to age backward and loving it.</li>
    <li> My skin would break out with just about every product I used. This product and one other does what it claims and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to break out. I would recommend this serum and I will continue to use it. As a side benefit the seller has been in contact with me to make sure I was satisfied, which was an extra bonus.</li>
    <li> Wow...I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m amazed my more: the product or the customer service!  First off, the product is fabulous.  I&#x27;m 32, I don&#x27;t have any major skin problems or wrinkles, but the fine lines that I had prior to using this serum are diminishing. My complexion just looks better, I seriously almost glow! Love love love this stuff. I am hooked! Now, let&#x27;s talk about this customer service!  TOP OF THE LINE!  It is seriously, no joke, the best service I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I&#x27;ll definitely be checking out more of Amara Organics&#x27; products.</li>
    <li> I am super skeptic when buying this kind of products, although I wanted to trust all the amazon good reviews about this serum. My skin got really burnt and lost a lot of its young feeling the past summertime due to 5 months of Sun, not always taken with sun protection, result: my skin started looking at least 3/4 years older than it should, damn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some moisturizing crap and didn&#x27;t work out, so I looked for a serum that could have give my skin the feeling it always had and kind of recover those months spent on the sun. I started using this serum once a day and at the beginning I though it was just not working, now its two weeks and for whatever reasons I truly believe that my rugs started getting softer and my skin generally brighter. I am using it twice a day right after showering, this serum has a lovely smell of honey and a elastic texture, it gives the skin immediate smootiness and elasticity and it doesn&#x27;t really need anything else to be combined with: it just works, I am 31 and I feel in my twenties again thanks to this serum, dig it and recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks now and have received compliments on how good my skin looks.  It does quite a good job of gently exfoliating the skin to reveal brighter , fresher skin.  I would highly recommend using a peel twice a week with this product.  I have fairly sensitive but this product does not irritate my skin in any way.  It is not a miracle worker, but for the price it is a very good product that delivers subtle, noticeable results.  Was much better than the last serum I tried and will buy it again</li>
    <li> am very happy with Vitamin C Serum and I will definitely order this product again. I can tell it is very high quality and it does exactly what it claims will do. My skin feels softer and firmer. Thank you so much for developing the product and I am hoping the quality and price stays the same.</li>
    <li> Best products ever. love AMARA ORGANICS!</li>
    <li> I was surprised how fast it worked...I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks and my skin is tighter, the texture is beautiful and my dark spots have faded. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I use this as part of my daily skincare regimen with Organic Rosehip Seed Oil from Instanaturals LLC. Since I started using these with my regular moisturizer, I have seen VERY VISIBLE improvements in my skins texture, the appearance of deep wrinkles and my overall &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34; Prior to using them, I had tried all kinds of expensive moisturizers and serums that never showed much promise. I feel like these products. in addition to an olive oil based moisturizer, have taken a decade off of my face. I also use a bentonite mask once a week.</li>
    <li> I was recently sent this amazing Natural, Vegan, &amp; Cruelty-Free Vitamin C Serum by Amara Organics. The product is 98% naturally derived and 72% organic. If you watch my recent shopping haul video, you heard me say “I wanted to start taking care of my skin more”. So naturally I jump at the opportunity to review this product. I’ve only used this product for a few days now and so far I really like the initial results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know result may vary from person to person, but my skin felt a little smoother and had a little glow after just one use. The product comes in a 1oz dark glass bottle with a dropper that makes this product easy to apply. A few drop truly go a long way with this product. The serum is a clear unscented liquid, and I apply a few drops while my face is a little wet from the mist of my toner. The serum absorbs very quickly, once this product air dry, then I apply my favorite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to testing this product I read a lot about Vitamin C Serum. And according to their claims Vitamin C Serum is just as effective as facelift, lasers, and chemical peels at reversing the effects of time and environmental damage to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a review. I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.</li>
    <li> Works well and no breakouts.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. Been using it for several weeks and notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product! I have been using it for a few months and truly have noticed a difference in my skin. The affordable price is also a great positive feature of the product.</li>
    <li> I would give this product a 5 star rating.  It is one of only a few vitamin c serums that have 20% vitamin c and at such a reasonable price!  And.......Organic to boot !  It glides on and soaks in very quickly, and completely.  I cover it with a moisturizer when it is completely dry.  My skin looks great with this treatment and I am 67!  I also take vitamin c supplements and have few lines.  People are amazed I am that old as my face looks so much younger.  I attribute that to good cosmetics, this is one of them!  I highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> I struggle with age and acne spots. This stuff is amazing! it makes my skin feel very smooth, fades dark marks, and does not make my face break out. You have to be patient with this serum as it takes about a month to see true results. The makers of the serum are extremely nice and thorough. They email you and give you direct contact information if you have any questions. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product has proven to be an excellent moisturizer for my neck and face. Having a skin condition on parts of my face that have little to no pigment, it is hard to keep my skin properly moisturized and from drying out. I like to apply this in the morning and then supplement it these [[ASIN:B00KLKCM9Q Phytoceramides ]]. This product gets me through most of the day but the supplements I take on the side keeps me moisturized into the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a younger man and not really appreciative of many cosmetic items in this category but with my skin, I do need something that keeps my face from looking like a half dried prune. This cream and my [[ASIN:B00KLKCM9Q &amp;#x2605; PHYTOCERAMIDES &amp;#x2605; Anti-aging supplement - Skin Restoring Ceramides from Rice - Plant Derived - Skin Rejuvenation - 30 capsules @ 40 mg - Anti-wrinkle Cream Alternative - Fake Facelift - Supplement highly recommended by America&#x27;s Favorite ...]]are the magic combo in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love the vit C serum! Have been using for a few weeks and have seen a noticeable difference. I use it as part of my morning and evening routine.</li>
    <li> This product absorbs quickly and my daughter told me that my pores are reduced considerably (I&#x27;ve had sun damage) and my skin looks so much healthier.</li>
    <li> I felt and saw the difference in my skin right away.  Look forward to more products.  And it keeps getting better.</li>
    <li> This serum is AMAZING! First off, I&#x27;d like to say that their customer service is impeccable!  Now to the product:  AMAZING.  I have been using this serum for 4 days now and already see a significant difference in my fine lines.  I am an Asian female in my late 20&#x27;s.  I have very sensitive and oily skin and was worried this might cause me to breakout.  To my surprise, t did not make me break out one bit.  I use this serum every night and each night my fine lines around my forehead and mouth are plumped out.  Since I already have oily skin I was also worried it would make my face oily but it did not.  I will definitely purchase again once I run out!</li>
    <li> My skin definitely looks healthier and fresher since using these products. Great value and great customer service. For reference I am 41 with combination skin. I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C Cleanser, Vit C Serum, and Age-Defying Moisturizer. Loving the Amara Organics line!</li>
    <li> Had stopped using Vit C products for about a month as I was not convinced that anything was happening... I was wrong the imperfections  gradually returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in the market for a new serum I was impressed by the number of positive reviews for this product, the fact that it was organic and the competetive price tag convinced me to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been a week but so far I love the fast absorbing formula. Applied in the morning after cleansing followed by my new spf product with titanium dioxide (no shine or stickiness)followed by a primer make-up goes on wonderfully, a first for me.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly have noticed an improvement in pore size, wrinkles and firmness almost immediately.</li>
    <li> I have been using this vitamin C serum and I love it! My face feels softer and smoother already. I would certainly recommend it to anyone wishing to fight signs of aging on face and neck areas.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not only affordable, it&#x27;s also the best.  I&#x27;ve tried vitamin c serums that cost 5x as much and are not organic and cannot claim no animal testing.  This is the complete package for my lifestyle.  I have seen rejuvenation of skin texture on my neck, acne spots fade super fast on my jaw line, and brown/age/sun spots fade on my forehead.  The rate of daily improvement seemed on par with my experience with Skinceuticals. That said, if you want more than vitamins C and E or something that has ferulic acid instead of hyaluronic acid you will have to look elsewhere, but give this a try first.</li>
    <li> First, let me start by saying the customer service from Amara Organics is top notch.  You can safely purchase from this company and if you have any concerns, it will be promptly addressed.  On to the product!  This product absorbs quickly and easily into the skin.  I prefer to apply at bedtime so it can work while I am at rest.  My complexion looks brighter and overall, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my&lt;br /&gt;Amara Organics Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;Serum.  And,I would order it&lt;br /&gt;again when I finish with this&lt;br /&gt;bottle. Also,a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m male, 35 yro &amp; I bought this serum based on the reviews i read online. I needed some product to apply and moisturize my face after a grueling session with the derma roller. I strongly recommend a derma roller so that this product can be more absorbent and more effective. After my face felt as if I had used sand paper all over, I applied the Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum and it was very refreshing. My skin had never looked this good and I&#x27;m all smiles :)</li>
    <li> Product delivered on time. Good price .I use it every day after cleaning my skin. I didn&#x27;t notice much improvement. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, but there must be something unnatural in it.  It caused my face to swell up and it hurt to touch.  I realized that it was doing something to my lymph nodes in my face.  It hurt so much to touch my face, it also broke me out a little too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to stop using it for a week and try it again and make sure it is the cause of my pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;The company gave me a refund within hours of me posting this review.  Awesome company, and the product was working, it just didn&#x27;t agree with me.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  My skin looks and feels fantastic...I feel like I&#x27;ve discovered the fountain of youth!  Highly recommend as part of a daily facial cleansing routine!</li>
    <li> Hi, I would like to recommend this product without any reservation.  I am a 50 year old man, whose outdoors type lifestyle put my skin through alot....20 years military, motorcycle riding, lots of beach.  When I began going back to school for digital media, I was in front of the camera alot, and just mentioned that fact to my sister, who sent me toward this product.  I had always used moisturizer and thought that is all anyone can do, but within a week, yes a week, I could see my skin on my face change.  Laugh lines less apparent, neck skin supple and tighter.  So there you have it, it really does work, even on a guy like me!  I am going to cut and paste this on the Avalon Organics Vitamin C renewal since I use that at night and it is the combination of the two that gave me these results</li>
    <li> Love this product and their service.  Seems to work better for softening my skin than the other Vitamin C Serum I bought from Amazon (also like the way the Amara dropper works better than the other product) .  I&#x27;m 62 years old, and as a result of many actinic keratosis treatments, have some very dry areas on my face.  This serum has really softened those patches and the rest of my facial skin as well.  After purchasing the product, I received a personal email from the co-founder of Amara wanting feedback and/or questions about the product.  She quickly responded back to me when I gave her feedback.  So, I will keep ordering this great product and appreciate the excellent service.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost a month and I have not seen any difference in my skin.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> OK, I usually make my own organic skin care items to avoid the bad stuff in regular and some organic cosmetics -- like benzene and such. So it was with a degree of skepticism I ordered this. But, I could tell my skin was brighter and smoother and felt better after using just a couple of times. I use it after washing, let it dry and then apply my skincare oil. Nice! Good product. But then I spilled a little...</li>
    <li> Product works ok but  not like the more expensive serums...Definitely a difference...I will still use my Obagi serum...Sorry but this doesn&#x27;t even compare....</li>
    <li> I use it once a day on my neck and face, what is left over goes on the back of my hands.  Sometimes I put it on my chest.  I think it has really helped my skin; texture, pores, spots, wrinkles, etc.  I will use this forever!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother to use with the Derma Roller I got her also. I definitely recommend. Being as its natural &amp; organic it didn&#x27;t burn her face when she put it on. LOVE the consistency &amp; feeling of it.</li>
    <li> Love the Product.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the form of delivery...dropper style, rather than a pump on some other serum bottles where I have wasted valuable serum.&lt;br /&gt;With a dropper, I am better able to control the amount dispensed.&lt;br /&gt;My skin just drinks up the liquid and feels better than when using cream alone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back for more when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I noticed results after only 1 week.  I have had people comment on how smooth and clear my skin looked.  I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for that perfect complexion.  This product will always be a part of my skincare regime.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> It is my second month using this product and so far so good I can see results in my skin. I like it because most of the serums has just Vitamin C, but this product also came with Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid which I consider like a plus. Before I was using expensive serums like Skin Ceuticals CE Felulic 30 ml, but not any more.</li>
    <li> After just a few weeks of using this serum, my face is glowing, brighter, acne marks are fading, and my pores are no longer clogged. I am very impressed and will certainly repurchase! This bottle is a great value and will last for a long time, even with daily use!</li>
    <li> I have been trying this brand for about a month now and I really like it.  My husband told me the other day that my skin on my face looked so smooth and flawless.  He doesn&#x27;t know that I have been wearing this every morning and evening before bed. .....  I&#x27;m pretty happy with this serum!!</li>
    <li> I had always washed my face with the same soaps &amp; had no reaction untill I started using this product. As soon as I applied this Amara organics vitamin C Serums with HA I immediately feels a burning sensation then it breaks up my face/skin like i am having pimples again.  I thought i can get use to it after a week but no i will need to return this if that&#x27;s possible.  Apparently i am allergic to it???  I dont want red bumps or burning sensation on my face so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to soften some fine lines around the eyes and on the forehead (I&#x27;m 31 with pretty fair skin).  So far I&#x27;m very impressed!  It absorbs very nicely and makes my skin feel very soft and silky.  Fantastic customer service, too - the little medicine dropper that came with it was carefully packaged, but somehow got damaged, so I contacted the company and not only did they reply promptly and send me a new dropper, they actually included a FREE WHOLE BOTTLE of the product!  I could not believe it!  Definitely recommend! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried the product and it does not work for me; I have oily skin and this made me break out more than normal. I can&#x27;t give this product a great review :(. I did not request to get my money back as of yet, but as soon as I emailed the company and told them that this product did not work for me the just submitted a refund for me without even asking for one. This is called GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Absorbs fast and moisturizes well. Will buy again.....</li>
    <li> So far, I am very happy with the product.  It&#x27;s already made my skin soft and smooth, even if I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of this product, or a combination of others that I&#x27;m also using, but, I can see that I actually look younger now!  Some of the lines have faded, and I look is much fresher!  Thank you.  I happy and plan to keep on using this.</li>
    <li> The product is great and the seller is great too. She contacted me with the instructions on how to use the serum and with helpful additional information , then when I received it she did the post sales contact to make sure I had no questions and to see how it was going and if the delivery had met my expectations. I will&lt;br /&gt;Definitely keep buying this serum because it really works.&lt;br /&gt;I had suffered from KP on my arms for a long time and applying this serum everyday has completely vanished the unpleasant bumps.give it a try you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month &amp; I have seen great improvement on my skin , I will buy it again! and yes I recommend it</li>
    <li> I love this product! I felt a huge difference in the lines on my face and lips when I was using this. Need to purchase more.</li>
    <li> I use this right after I use my derma roller &amp; I love how its leaving my skin!!!!!</li>
    <li> It works great and is very affordable when compared to similar products of the highest quality.  Will repurchase. Their customer service is unparalleled.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a week now however so far I really like the way it has soften my face and has not dried it out like other vitamin c products can. I make many of my own skin care products but I wanted an organic vitamin c that would be affective and didn&#x27;t think I could achieve that. The price seems reasonable when you compare it to other serums on the market. I also appreciate how the founder has followed through to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase.  It shows she really cares about the quality of her product and what improvements can be made.</li>
    <li> It is very watery but dries quickly and tightens the skin. It ihas already evened out my skin tone by lightening some sun spots on my cheek...love it!</li>
    <li> I layer this serum every morning with other facial creams. It is a great addition! I have noticed a big difference in my fine lines and it has brightened my face. Arrived on time and in perfect condition! I will order again when i run low.</li>
    <li> What I like about this serum is that it is non-oily and is rapidly absorbed by the skin.  There is no irritation and, at least in my case, no redness.  I shared it with my husband.  He was so impressed that we ordered 2 more bottles.  After using the product for 3 days, I noticed that 2 dark spots on my face were visibly lightened.  The scar on my husband’s face (which he had for nearly a year) disappeared after 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We plan to continue using the serum daily for 6 months to see how far we can take the improvements.</li>
    <li> I love it!! Love the way my face feels. It&#x27;s easy to use I use it with my derm roller.</li>
    <li> Great product great price.  I love how it makes my skin look and feel.  I will definitely be back for more!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Serum for about 3 weeks and I am defintiley seeing and feeling a positive difference in my skin.  I would reorder when needed.</li>
    <li> It is easily absorbed into my skin and my skin feels a lot softer after using it..</li>
    <li> Product feels smooth, and looks radiant on skin and tightens it immediately ... The product arrived very fast and I have ordered more as I am definitely going to continue using this. I gave 5 stars because it is an excellent product and very good value for money.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin radiant and thats something that didnt happen from just using hyaluronic acid alone.  Im a man so I dont / cant /wont use  makeup and layers of base coat fillers and colored powders  , that would probably tend to hide the effects of this remarkable product.  Ive tried Watts line of serums but this serum hits it out of the park; It creates a very noticeable glow to the skin. I dig it.  The product actually comes with followup  instructions and customer service , I thought I was dreaming. What company offers that kind of service? Of course I didnt follow any of the instructions, Im not even sure what a toner is.</li>
    <li> My face looks so much smoother after a couple weeks of using.  Fine lines are less noticeable .  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.  It&#x27;s very light and absorbs easily.  I use it under my moisturizer and I&#x27;ve found that it makes a difference in the way my skin feels and looks.  Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> It was important to me that the serum arrived quickly as I understood that vitamin C can oxidize quickly.  I have been using the product now for almost a week.  The first couple of applications burned a little, but left no ill effects on my skin.  It&#x27;s a little too early to say whether the product is going to work for me.  My goal is to lighten some dark spots caused from sun damage on my face.  All good things take time.  I&#x27;ll continue to use and am hoping to be able to say that this is a good product.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful product, it is what I was looking for, my skin started to look better right away. Try it!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the great product and fast shipping. The serum works and feels great on my face.. Will definitely be buying more</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the Vitamin C Serum.  It does leave a little sticky feeling after applying, but let it rest a bit, and your skin does feel smooth and of course, the benefits make it well worth using.</li>
    <li> Works great especially after using my deems roller!!  I have noticed visible acne and sun damage scars look better, thanks!!</li>
    <li> The vitamin C has made my skin look wonderful.  I was looking for something to get rid of the brown spots--this was not it, but I would recommend it highly for aging skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy i found Amara organic serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months and i see the result but not yet reach to my expectation. There&#x27;s no magic when it comes to beauty and it always take sometimes and I am willing to wait:). But i have noticed that this product helps on whitening dark spots and clearing my little wrinkles around my area plus it lighten my pimple scar. I used it every morning after cleaned and toned. I will keep using it until 6 months to see the best result and if it will, then, will use it forever.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to give it a review.  I am over 70 years old and do not expect miracles.  I just would like healthy looking skin and maybe dark spots and some wrinkles to be diminished.  I do like the feel of the serum.  It is light and not greasy. I am going to use all of the product, then make a decision on whether or not to order more.</li>
    <li> The Vendor was kind enough to email me about the product. It&#x27;s excellent. It&#x27;s lightweight. Absorbs quickly. You can mix the serum with your body lotion or face or hand lotion as an added booster. I love using this product daily in the morning after washing my face especially after I give myself a light exfoliating scrubbing peel.</li>
    <li> Like it! Use it every day with my daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum!  I have been using it daily since getting it a few weeks ago, and I already see a difference in my skin. Even though I am in my late 50&#x27;s, I was still getting blackheads on my nose, and whiteheads on my chin, but this wonder serum has cleared them up! I applied it directly to my skin at first. Now I am mixing it in an inexpensive moisturizer (CeraVe) along with a hyaluronic acid serum (see my review) and a tiny bit of doctor-prescribed Retin-A.  I find this is a much better anti-aging solution for me, and less costly than the expensive anti-aging creams I was buying. And with this Armara Organics Vitamin C Serum, my skin is clear too!</li>
    <li> I waited to write this review to see if it really works. It does. I am so pleasantly surprised. The lines on my forehead, lips, and eyes are really minimizing. Third purchase  of this product. The best on market, I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
    <li> Do not see any changes after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it with my derma roller. I will definitely keep ordering.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described. It goes on smoothly and I could see the effects after 8 weeks. Skin is smoother with decreased discoloration areas. It also worked on other areas of body besides my face. I will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel, not sure if it is lightening the spots I need it to quite yet but we will see!</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for a little over a week now.  I try to buy only all natural/organic cosmetic products and swear by them so far.  I love this product and definitely notice a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone, texture, noticeable pore-size and I think even turn over of new cells.  My skin also seems just brighter, especially in the under eye area…. and I have 4 kids under 7 and don&#x27;t get much sleep.  I feel like I have a foundation look without foundation on the many days I choose not to wear or don&#x27;t have time for make-up.  Best product I&#x27;ve found in years!  Also, I have really sensitive skin and accidentally got it close to my eyes one day, and that didn&#x27;t even bother me!  Love it, will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> Love it. Although spilled half by not putting cap on tightly. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum every morning for a little over a month now and I&#x27;m really happy with the results so far. My skin feels really soft and has a nice glow. I love that the serum goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. Even though I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long, I&#x27;m already starting to notice that my skin looks better and fine lines look like they are starting to fade. It only takes a little bit to cover my whole face, so even though it&#x27;s a small bottle, you get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this wasn’t hydrating enough for me. I tried their hyaluronic acid serum instead and it works better for my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for 3 days but I can&#x27;t say enough about this Serum. My skin feels clearly softer and I&#x27;m looking forward to see how much more I will see as weeks go by!</li>
    <li> I believe that this product is drying for my skin.  Have been trying to just add a few drops to my moisturizer to see if that helps.  So far, not so good.  I have problematic, flaky dry skin.  Keeping it under control is a 24/7 job.  Anything that adds to the dry conditions is not good for me.  I do think however that it brightens skin.</li>
    <li> I ACTUALLY DIDNT USE THIS FOR MY FACE BUT MY TUMMY FOR SOME STRECH MARKS I HAD AND I WAS AMAZE HOW MUCH MY STRECH MARKS FADE I COULDNT BELIEVE IT I USE IT EVERY NIGHT WITH MY DERMA ROLLER AND IT HAS WORKED WONDERS ON MY SKIN VITAMIN C IS EVERYONES BEST FRIEND!!! I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE OF AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
    <li> Just rating on feel of product. No irritation. Company seems dedicated to customer service but I can&#x27;t evaluate for effect on skin yet. I imagine I should see effects over time. Will try to remember to update then. I will say I am interested in how they &amp;#34;buffer&amp;#34; this C because when I accidentally got it IN my EYE I was bracing for the WORST stinging reaction but got none.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I wonder if the other reviews are real. I would look for a Vitamin C Serum that is over 20%. No real results here.</li>
    <li> I will have to use this product for a while before I can rate it.</li>
    <li> No considerable difference in my skin since using this product .</li>
    <li> Product goes on smoothly, lightly moisturizing, good under make up. Half way thru the bottle and can&#x27;t say that I notice any changes in my skin though</li>
    <li> I just started using this. I got an email with directions from the seller. It feels like a vit C serum should feel so far. I know it will take a month or so of religious use for results but I decided to upgrade to a better vit C product and this seems to be high quality. Vit C feels moisturizing and sort of tight. no stinging. Hoping it will be good.</li>
    <li> See improvement in my skin !  Very happy with results so far!</li>
    <li> The product feels good upon application.  I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I haven&#x27;t had enough time to evaluate the product.  I wish they would give  you more time before asking for a review.  How can I tell whether it is going to give me good results in a couple of weeks when they tell you that it will take a number of weeks to see a difference!  I am prone to being allergic to some products and so far I haven&#x27;t been yet.  The other reviews stated that they had had not problems, so that is why I am trying this one.</li>
    <li> I tried another brand of vitamin c serum and a lotion and I never saw any results with those products. I started using this serum a little over a month ago and I really like it. It&#x27;s definitely better than any of the other products I tried before. I feel like it worked faster and I can actually see results. I have a line on my forehead that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of and it looks like it&#x27;s going away now. I also like the way it makes my skin feel after I put it on. I&#x27;m happy to finally find a product that actually works.</li>
    <li> super impressed and happy with the Vitamin C serum product. I have to admit that I almost never buy new, trendy beauty&lt;br /&gt;products but I was curious and felt good about the ingredients and quality of this one after researching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive and reactive skin, and not only does the serum not aggravate it, but it seems to add a little brightness. It also works great around my eyes, which I was worried about, as a lot of things cause them to swell or burn.</li>
    <li> I live in a very dry climate &amp; have extremely dry skin. I&#x27;ve seen a remarkable difference in my skin in a short period of time.</li>
    <li> The product has improved my face quite a bit.  I still have sun damage and I am in my second bottle.  Not sure if I will buy the third bottle since the results are not truly amazing like I was expecting it.</li>
    <li> I love this vitamin C serum!  I have used a lot of different products that are very expensive since I turned 50, but this is the cheapest one that works much better than previous one I have used!  I finally found the best serum for my skin now that I&#x27;m 60!  I use it in the morning and evening, and apple moisturizer on top of it.  It looks great and feels smooth on my skin!  People are asking what I use on my face, and of course, I highly recommend Amara Organic Serum!</li>
    <li> Really like this product!  It is unscented and goes on nicely - doesn&#x27;t feel slimy like a lot of &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; products.  I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and can see a difference in my skin tone and texture.  It looks more healthy and feels firmer. I will definantly buy again.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so refreshed after applying this to my face, and that feeling lasts until I wash it off. Customer service is stupendous!! I&#x27;ve already recommended this company to all of my friends and family. Will definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> decided to try this because of all the positive reviews.  i have been using obagi 20% c serum for years.  this product feels like i am just putting water on my face.  it doesnt have the smooth oily texture that the obagi does. i also noticed sun spots coming back since using it.  reordered the obagi and will stick with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this Vitamin C Serum every day for 2 months and am very pleased with the results. It&#x27;s gentle on sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve noticed definite improvement in skin tone and brightness. Fine lines are less visible and my skin looks more youthful. I&#x27;m going to order a second bottle.</li>
    <li> great product to use after dermeroller on your skin.. keeps it nice and firm . i highly recommend following directions with this product when using dermarollers.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s easy to apply, soaks in quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and supple as never before. I will continue to get this product.</li>
    <li> I LIKE it, keeps my freckled skin clearer and smoother.  Im 67 and this is a nice serum for my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  It has made my skin brighter and has helped with texture.  I am 22 and have pretty average skin (no huge breakouts, not oily or dry, etc.), so I can&#x27;t comment on wrinkle reduction or acne help. This does seem to be making my face firmer, which is a huge plus! I will definitely keep buying!</li>
    <li> I new a fewore weeks to see results.  Ty!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I have used other Vitamin C serums before that have felt thick and sticky. this felt light, while making my skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s. I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I dont feel the diference!!!</li>
    <li> Great product..... but wish it sold in larger size  FAST delivery</li>
    <li> I really liked this brand.  Bought another one because it was cheaper, but the serum in it is very thin and watery.  Will buy this again when I reorder.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin .</li>
    <li> Well it doesn&#x27;t smell, it goes on silky, absorbs quickly and lasts a long while.  I just haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.  :( I guess it&#x27;s not for everybody.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference with using this, but  I keep using it because it says it has vitamin C which at least cant&#x27; be bad for me.</li>
    <li> I started using this product in addition to my daily skin care and I could not be happier. In addition to using [[ASIN:B00KLKCM9Q &amp;#x2605; PHYTOCERAMIDES &amp;#x2605;]] my skin has never felt better. This product gives your skin a nice healthy dose of suppliments but where the magic really lays is how much moisture your skin really begins to retain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this serum will help to moisturize your face on a daily basis, I cannot help but suggest adding Phytoceramides in combination with this product to help keep those wrinkles away. It is the 1 - 2 punch to keeping aging at bay. [[ASIN:B00KLKCM9Q &amp;#x2605; PHYTOCERAMIDES &amp;#x2605; SUPER SALE &amp;#x2605; ONLY $17.99!!! &amp;#x2605; BEST VALUE ON AMAZON &amp;#x2605; Anti-aging supplement - Skin Restoring Ceramides from Rice - Plant Derived - Skin Rejuvenation - 30 capsules @ 40 mg - Anti-wrinkle Cream Alternat...]]</li>
    <li> I started using this product to improve my skin.  It seems this product does work.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not do much, Don&#x27;t know if I would recommend... maybe someone else will have better luck...</li>
    <li> I love this product!  While I&#x27;m not really into make up,  I just want a clear and glowing face. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet to worry but sometimes I get break outs that leave dark spots.  I&#x27;ve used it for like 2 weeks now and I stopped having break outs and my skin seems clearer and dark spots seems disappearing. I&#x27;m so amazed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never posted a review before, but I had to for this product. It is AWESOME! Within 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my hyper-pigmentation. I&#x27;ve even been out in the sun several times and this product still has lightened my face a lot. Will definitely keep using it :-)</li>
    <li> Caused my Face to break out, I can not continue using it due to the acne that it created! Extremely disappointed!</li>
    <li> There is no smell, which is great because I use a lot of products on my face and sometimes the smells mixed together don&#x27;t smell so good anymore. This product didn&#x27;t really help that much with my oily skin but it did help with plumping up my skin so it looks softer.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Your skin tingles a bit after applying this serum...so I know it&#x27;s doing some hard work. I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to see a difference but I can feel my face getting softer to the touch. A few drops goes a long way so it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT for my skin!!!</li>
    <li> Ladies and gentlemen , forget the surgery , and Botox , give this a try , it really works , I&#x27;m 52 and look amazing after a week of this serum . My face had blotches , no moisture , redness , scarring , brown spots , and sagging and my own family and friends are telling me I look amazing even my neck and decholate and hands look  like I&#x27;m in my early 30s and for the price I  am loving this wonder serum . Please try it . I know it sounds to good to be true but it does works and I have extremely sensitive skin . ☺️🙏</li>
    <li> After using the serum for just a few days, I can see and feel the difference on my face.  I love it and will continue using it.  I have to say that this was a fantastic \\&quot;free sample\\&quot; and I thank you very much.</li>
    <li> excellent product and great price point.</li>
    <li> On third bottle. Awesome customer service! Skin seems brighter. Wish bottle lasted longer but will still continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Using this with Phytoceramides I can already feel a difference in my skin texture:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks and I already see my skin improving. I have a very ruddy complexion and this product is getting the red out. I highly recommend this. Oh, I am 56 years old. Age is always important to know on a beauty product review.</li>
    <li> This serum is very very good.</li>
    <li> This might work for some but I did not see an incredibly difference in my skin.  Did it make my skin smoother?  Yes, but for the price I paid, I don&#x27;t think I can justify buying another bottle for slightly smoother skin.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this produc&amp;#34; vitamin C Serum for Face 20%&amp;#34; my skin looks healthy and soft, works very good right after Derma Roller or Derma wand.I love it:)</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is a dream to apply, quickly absorbed . I really didn&#x27;t expect to see benefits so quickly but within 2 days my skin was improved with less fine lines and brighter appearance</li>
    <li> not sure if it works any wonders or not since i use so many products. I&#x27;ll order it again though</li>
    <li> I am loving the skin glow.</li>
    <li> Hope this works for us</li>
    <li> Have only been using for three weeks, but so far it seems to be working as advertised!</li>
    <li> Been over a month, do not notice any difference.</li>
    <li> This serum did wonders for my face - giving it a glow it didn&#x27;t have before.  It also lightened (but didn&#x27;t get rid of) a brown spot on one of my eyelids.  This serum has become a part of my health routine.</li>
    <li> I have always had bad skin; dry and with bad acne scars, and this helps moisturize my skin and works as an amazing skin prep before foundation. Smells clean too</li>
    <li> Been using this from past 3 months, no change/effect on skin.used 4 bottles expecting that it may need sometime but lost confidence about it</li>
    <li> I used this product and can&#x27;t say that I noticed a real difference in my skin.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and applied easily.  Would I try again, maybe, but right now I&#x27;m shopping around for other Hyaluronic Acid/Vitamin C products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for 1 month in the morning exactly as instructed and I have not seen any improvement in my skin. My biggest skin concern is dark spots, and I do not see any of the spots fade. At least other vitamin c serums out there leave my skin silky smooth, but this product is just like dabbing on water.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle now and it is working, so be patient and you&#x27;ll see great results. Quick shipping too.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this fine product.  My skin is much brighter and smoother and even the fine lines are beginning to lessen.  I use this on my neck area as well and have seen very good results there as well.  I feel this product gives an accumulate effect, so be patient in using it.  The product is very economical and lasts a long time.  I am excited about even more positive results as I continue to use.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! I&#x27;m already seeing results and it&#x27;s been less than a week! The shipping was fast and I haven&#x27;t had any stinging or any irritations. I would recommend it to family and friends. I look forward in purchasing it again! Thank you for the great product Amara Organics! ^_^</li>
    <li> I do notice a tightening effect on my face after applying... My skin tone looks better, I have been using it religiously for about 3 weeks. I wish it lasted longer, debating to buy again?......</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and very good! It&#x27;s only been a few days but there&#x27;s a remarkable difference in my skin. My dull skin is starting to glow! It&#x27;s good for aging skin too.</li>
    <li> high quality product for a very affordable price. very pleased</li>
    <li> It works great!  Tightened my skin and my skin looks a lot smoother.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the vitamin C serum!  I cant believe what a difference it has made on my skin. My face looks so bright and fresh that my family and friends all comment on how &amp;#34;rested&amp;#34; and younger I look.  I can see it every time I look in the mirror. The sagging in my neck and around my mouth is gradually going away and the discolorations and wrinkles are very much minimized and mostly gone! I am 55 and have tried a lot of expensive products but none of them have given me the positive results that this serum has done for my skin. I will continue to use this fantastic product. My only wish is that it was sold in larger volume because I would love to use it as a treatment for other sun damaged skin on my body like my arms and back  from all of the ridiculous sun tanning I did in my teens and twenties.  This serum really has turned back the hands of time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24, I started getting acne ever since high school and it wasn&#x27;t too bad here and there, some areas more than others, sometimes it would get pretty bad in one area of my face or on my back but eventually it cleared up. I wash my face every morning and night with the neutrogena  acne light face cleaner and use a light moisturizer with sunscreen. I have been doing this for years and for some reason towards the end of my college years my acne started getting really bad, and I even went to a dermatologist and spend a ton of money on all different types of soaps, face cleansers, sunscreen moisturizers, even their expensive makeup and prescription medicine! and NOTHING worked my acne kept coming back and getting worse, I would use all these cleaners but it would dry out my skin, so i would use the moisturizer and it would clog up my skin, I even use oil free makeup and that works for me. I&#x27;m only 24 but since my skin has gone through so much with the acne and dryness, I can notice some lines and wrinkles that will form in the future so I randomly saw this stuff on amazon and started doing some research on it and gave this one a try! FINALLY after all these years, this WORKS for me! It&#x27;s thin and light enough that it doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores and moisturizes my skin so it doesn&#x27;t feel so dry and flaky! Finally I found a BALANCE for my skin!! It was the right moisturizer that I needed, everything else I&#x27;ve been using is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and love it.  My face looks so clear and healthy.  I was having problems with break outs but not any more since using this.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I just LOVE this stuff! Feels amazing going on. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t do anything but good for me.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month so far,  my skin looks a little tender, smoother, but I can not see much difference yet, the price is reasonal, so I will continue to try it several more months and see if I will still like it or not.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes my skin feel fresh and look radiant. I use this in combination with a derma roller and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it.  I use as directed, in the morning.  I Also use a peptide  serum at night.  This product has a clarifying effect on the skin.  It has totally eliminated the dark circles under my eyes and has brighten my entire face.  Great product, thank you Amazon and Amara Organics for this fabulous day serum.</li>
    <li> I love how this serum works. It has a tingling effect, so I can feel it working to replenish the skin on my face.</li>
    <li> this product, Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum for Face, is amazing.  Now, I don&#x27;t get amazed easily. But at the age of 74 and living under the brutal desert sun at 6000&#x27; altitude, I have some serious wrinkle issues.  The Amara serum has, in less than three weeks, taken ten years off of my face. Who knows where this will stop?  As recommended, one should apply the serum morning (and evening) to skin which has been carefully cleaned (I use witch hazel).  It sops right up.  I&#x27;m always tempted to put more on.  Tip:  use it on the back of your hands, it is fascinating to see the dark spots disappear...slowly but surely.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it every morning and my face is brighter and smoother. I also don&#x27;t break out as much since I&#x27;ve been using it. I&#x27;m very happy with it and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is the second purchase of this item and I am quite pleased with the results! It makes your skin feel great along with making wrinkles much less pronounced. I am in my 80s and I can tell a difference. This item arrived on time in good shape. I will reorder this item!</li>
    <li> It was delivered promptly. I use this everyday, and my face hasn&#x27;t broken out like it did with previous Vit C &amp;#34;serums&amp;#34; I tried. This serum is not oily, very fluid like water, and dries fast, within a minute on the face. A little goes a long way. Most of the time, I apply it in the morning, but on occasion, I will re-apply, especially when I go out in the sun or when I  have to wash my face. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have anything on my face or neck. I also like the company that sells it, because they send a followup email to make sure the serum arrived in good condition, and also, to give a well thought out instructions and helpful hints on how to apply and when to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the time, I use it in combination with pure hyaluronic acid serum. My face looks great after I used these serums,. I apply these serums first, and then use a sunscreen over it to keep my skin from getting sun damage. my skin looks smoother and most of my wrinkles and furrows have disappeared or have gotten shallow. My face also looks less blotchy. My neck area has really improved as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered some more. It lasted me for 4 months.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for a very long time yet, but I can report that it appears to be a well made serum.  It is in liquid form, so place a few drops in your hands, rub together and then apply to your face.  It goes on thinly and drys quickly.  It has little odor and has high quality ingredients.  It does leave my skin feeling nice, not too dry.  Not sure yet what the long term effects will be on my skin--I will update later.</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful. It is excellent quality and after a few weeks, I see a noticeable difference in my skin.  The customer service is outstanding too!</li>
    <li> I am turning 50 this month and regret that I didn’t start using this product earlier. My skin care regiment has really made a visible difference in my skin.  I micro needle once a week and use the vitamin C serum in the AM along with a moisturizer with sunblock and retinol every other night combined with a moisturizer.  My skin looks healthier. I look refreshed and not tried during the day. And, my wrinkles are gradually smoothing out and my skin feels firmer.  I look forward to waking up in the mornings looking in the mirror to find what changed overnight.</li>
    <li> I love Amara products. The customer service is great. I once received a broken bottle of retinol and I emailed Jennifer. She was so polite and replaced my bottle with no hesitation. I&#x27;ve gone through five vitamins c bottles. I feel like I can&#x27;t do my morning routine without this stuff. It has significantly help my acne scars and laugh lines. You can&#x27;t beat the price. I save the glass bottles for traveling. I just ordered the eye cream and retinol for my mother. I will review in a month or so.</li>
    <li> I have been using serums for longer than I can remember.  While I have tried a myriad of poor products, or products I loved that ended up being discontinued, I rarely find one that makes a significant difference in the way my face feels and looks.  Well that was until now.  This product is amazing!!!  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and my face is noticeably smoother and brighter.  Here is the info I always look for when looking at reviews and hopefully this will help you.  The consistency is very thin and a little goes a long way.  There is really no smell at all that I can sense.  Within a minute or two I can feel tightening of my skin but nothing uncomfortable at all.  I apply only in the morning and follow up with a tinted moisturizer with SPF 15.  I have had absolutely no adverse reaction and the higher concentration of Vitamin C is a bonus.  Try it and if you are like me you will fall in love with it!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to use this after all the great reviews.  I used it 2 days, and all seemed well, but I woke on the third day with my hands and feet itching insanely.  I had no idea what it could be, but ran to Google, which informs me this typically is a delayed allergic reaction to topical exposures, like lotions or soaps.  Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t last very long--maybe an hour.  The directions suggested trying it in a small area first, to check for allergic reactions, but I really was expecting something localized (in the area where I used it), not something systemic.  So, be aware of this possibility!  I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the customer service was fantastic--I really liked the email with directions that they sent soon after I placed my order, and when I emailed them back about the reaction I had, they immediately refunded my money.</li>
    <li> So far for me this seems to be working. I&#x27;m using it twice a day. My face seems different after about 3 weeks of usage, I can&#x27;t quite seem to put my finger on what it&#x27;s doing but my skin looks better and I will see if the wrinkles diminish more. I&#x27;ve been using this with a no alcohol witch hazel to tone, and Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair with Bel Essence cream as my moisturizer. I also use the Neutrogena face scrubber (don&#x27;t recall the real name ) all these things for me seem to be working. I&#x27;m also using this for a skin condition that seems to make the marks on my skin less noticeable. So far I&#x27;m very happy. The makers of this also sent an e-mail explaining usage of this product and answered some questions for me. Very nice customer service. I will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> The first ingredient is water, the second Aloe Barbardensis leaf extract.  Had I known I was purchasing Aloe  Vera for my face I&#x27;d have moved along to another product.  Aloe anywhere near my eyes causes them to tear profusely and constantly until I wash it off. My nose runs as if I&#x27;d inhaled pollen or concentrated dust mite fecal material.&lt;br /&gt;The label says this is &amp;#34; the highest form of active Vitamin C with Vitamin E suspended in a concentrated base of pure vegan hyaluronic acid&amp;#34; . Sounds perfect. The third ingredient is &amp;#34;sodium ascorbyl phosphate ( vitamin C&amp;#34;.  Dr oz and current literature maintain that L ascorbic acid is the active vitamin c.)&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is the 4th ingredient but witch hazel is fifth and there are 16 ingredients, many of them known irritants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d found the perfect serum when all I accomplished is wasting money on yet another snake oil destined for the trash bin. What a disappointment! It seem even doing your research can leave you vulnerable to the cosmetic industry&#x27;s thievery.</li>
    <li> Get this serum immediately. !! First of all, this vendor provided very good customer service. I received an email from the vendor describing how to use the product and get the best results. That&#x27;s very personalized service and it shows they care about their customers!  As far as results, it&#x27;s been about 2 weeks... I&#x27;ve used this product in the morning under sunscreen. And then a little at night before applying argan oil. The strip of pigmentation on my cheek is already diminishing. My facialist has noticed that the brown spots are lighter. I imagine they will be nearly gone soon enough. My pores are smaller, and my skin has a pretty glow. This product works. And it&#x27;s only 2 weeks. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in 3 months. I&#x27;ll be back for an updated review! Also the price of this product is reasonable. It&#x27;s hard to believe I spent a fortune on expensive serums and got no results. And then I find this reasonably priced serum gets me better results than something I spent $100 on. Shhhh! Don&#x27;t tell them! I don&#x27;t want them to raise the price!! :)</li>
    <li> Used the whole bottle, didn&#x27;t see any results as the others in here claim.</li>
    <li> This is a truly amazing product.  My skin is glowing, the texture is hugely improved &amp; general condition is so much better,  fine lines &amp; pore size are both much improved.  It is an excellent product &amp; full of Vitamin C &amp; E. This product really delivers &amp; I even bought more of it . I could not do without it now plus it is ORGANIC !</li>
    <li> Love the serum. It feels great after I apply the serum and derma roller use, I am tempted to use it everyday, although I feel I shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Excellant!!!  Better than Botox.</li>
    <li> Good quality! Nicely priced:) customer service was great!</li>
    <li> On my 2nd tube. This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and customer service is excellent. I receive my bottle a week ago and started using it. I&#x27;ve seen differences in my skin texture already. Skin appear smoother and softer, also it even fade scars. Highly recommended this to all.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful lightweight serum, that really works for me!  I love how my skin looks after just a short time using it, and it&#x27;s even made my dark spots lighter.  Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This serum is pretty amazing, I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and I can already see a difference.  I even got a letter emailed to me from the co-founder Jennifer Thompson explaining how to best use the serum.  How great is that!  This is how a company should operate, you don&#x27;t get that level of customer care anymore.  I will be ordering another serum soon.</li>
    <li> Great product. It works!</li>
    <li> I have pretty reactive skin, and difficulty maintaining the moisture balance.  In only a couple weeks of use, the texture of my skin has improved quite a bit--with way less sensitivity.  My moisturizer also seems much more effective than without it.  I am passionate about using skincare with natural ingredients, and have tried lots and lots of different brands over the years, without finding anything I want to stay loyal to.  Amara Organics might just win my loyalty.  My face has a lovely glow that it didn&#x27;t used to have thanks to this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Amara Organics Vit. C Serum by accident.  Thought I was getting the one I usually order, but this was a good thing as I love the Amara Organics Vit. C Serum much better than the other product I was using.  This product is thinner and applies much easier, plus it will last longer as I don&#x27;t use as much on each application.  It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a mask like feel once dried.</li>
    <li> It is just another serum I just tried to get some better skin change, yet no changes</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this brand that I use and I do love the way it gets absorbed into my skin. When I wash my face first thing in the morning, I find that my skin feels so silky and soft when I use this.  A small amount goes a long way too. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this twice now - I love it.  Laugh lines and forehead lines are gone.  I use it every morning after I shower and sometimes before I go to bed.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using my second bottle of this stuff; I love it! It feels so good when I apply it and I like the protection it provides. I really wish if had it available 40 years ago when I was sunbathing a lot. I still get out in the sun as much as possible. The Texas sun gets pretty hot and I drive a convertible. I feel good with the serum on!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother as a gift. She loves the product. I visited her this week and noticed a huge difference in her face. Wrinkles have become smaller and her overall tone is smoother and even. She adores the product and now both my sister and I will be ordering this! (Maybe the eye cream too!!!)</li>
    <li> Will order more when it is gone.</li>
    <li> So far I like this serum.</li>
    <li> I think this is working.</li>
    <li> I tried a free sample and I like it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dry skin type, it&#x27;s easy to absorb and I feel good .</li>
    <li> I really like this vitamin c serum. It leaves no residue and no strong smell to compete with perfume. Easy to use. Love the consistency and size. Easy to travel with also. </li>
    <li> I saw results right away. Tighter pores, more even tone and fine lines vanished&lt;br /&gt;I Aldo saw improvement in deeper lines around my mouth. I am reordering this week.</li>
    <li> arrived at the given day. excellent.</li>
    <li> It dioesn&#x27;t seem to work. I do not see any difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this Serum.  Have tried a few and found that this one really works the best.  Also it has no odor and is a clear fluid that absorbs in the face right away.  My skin seems to be more radiant so will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also received a very nice email from one of the company reps checking to see how it was working for me and if I had any questions.  I did have some questions and they were answered right away.  So I would say that the customer service is excellent.</li>
    <li> I put the serum on every morning and love the way it makes my skin feel. I forgot to put it on one morning and my skin felt naked without it!</li>
    <li> I bought this serum as a Christmas gift for my sister because she&#x27;s really into beauty products and my girlfriend recommended it. It was a big hit. She said she loves it and is going to buy more after the bottle runs out, so I guess I did a good job!</li>
    <li> So far I like the product. I&#x27;m looking for an alternative treatment for my eczema. I have had nothing effective but steroids. I have used pounds of Cortisone cream and really would like to avoid steroids altogether. The good news is that your Vit C serum with hyaluronic acid is quite effective - almost as good as Cortisone. The experiment continues...</li>
    <li> I was looking for a serum with vitamin C and E so I decided to give this a try. I like that it has hyaluronic acid too. I live in a dry climate so that helps keep my skin feeling hydrated. After I put this on, it soaks in fast and makes my skin feel nice and soft right away. My skin looks great, kind of has a brighter glow. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Great product.  i am hooked. It really shrunk my pores and I am getting lots of compliments about how good my skin looks.  It took about two weeks to notice a difference but it really does make a difference!  A little goes a long way.  One dropper full will cover face neck and decollate.  Really love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It has made my skin firmer and given it a bright glow. Skin tone is evening out too. I even had someone comment on my skin and ask me what I was doing different. Highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on me at all.</li>
    <li> Have been using this serum with other Amara Products and like the result.  It is quick drying and not sticky at all.  I believe my skin seems clearer since using it.</li>
    <li> This product is the blomb and I will keep ordering it from now on.</li>
    <li> Great to have a reaonable, organic vegan option.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, makes my skin soft and glowy</li>
    <li> I am liking to use the vitamin C and E - hyaluronic acid serum right after my witch hazel toner and before my moisturizer cream. It makes my skin to feel so soft than just using the cream by itself.    It absorbs rapidly, and my skin tone seem to improve a little (I am often exposed to the sun during the summer for my work).    I am 39 and looking to achieve a more youthful skin that does not look like that only when I have applied a certain product on my skin. -That is fabulous when you need a quick solution, but would I want to use products that do not contain toxic ingredients, and can notice the changes even when I have skipped the application for a little while.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! Made my skin softer the first time I put it on! Have less lines and my skin just looks amazing now!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product! Makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have been using it for approximately three months and am thrilled with the results. My skin is very sensitive and prone to breakouts. This product has not caused me to break out and my skin has never looked better. My skin is brighter, smooth, more even toned and soft. I use it every morning, just three drops applied to damp cleansed skin. It glides on beautifully. I have already ordered my second bottle. I love the fact that there are no parabens or other chemicals. I have read on their website that they are developing more products and I can&#x27;t wait to try them! This product will forever be a part of my skincare routine. In addition, the customer service is unparalleled, with the co-founder personally &amp;#34;checking in&amp;#34; to give usage directions and see how I felt about the product. Thrilled with the product and the company.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic and the customer service is phenomenal!! I ordered the product they sent instructions and follow up information I also received a letter checking to make sure I was enjoying the product which again is fantastic!! I have been using the serum for a week or so and it is great! Thank you for such a great product!</li>
    <li> Great buy, can&#x27;t find it anywhere for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Thanks again!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I saw absolutely no difference in my skin after using this product as directed for the entire bottle. I may as well have just been splashing water on my face.</li>
    <li> I cannot express how much I love Vitamin C Serum. It is the one product that I have been using off and on the last couple of months and have really seen and felt results on my face. My skin feels softer, clearer, younger, firmer, and looks better. I normally have dry areas on my face and those are gone because of this great product. The fine lines are my forehead are more faint than before. I use it once in the morning after my shower, and before I put any makeup on---I replaced my moisturizer with this because it is an oil and keeps my face moisturized all day. Then I use it after washing my face at night before I go to bed. You really only need to use a few drops on your face.</li>
    <li> I just got this product and have used it for several days now. I like it and can already tell that it&#x27;s starting to make my skin look better. I like the way it feels and how it dries quickly. My makeup goes on smooth over it as well. If it works this well after just a few days, I can&#x27;t wait to see how good my skin will look after a few months. it also smells really good as well.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about two weeks, but so far I am very impressed with the product. Before I even received it, I received and email from the company giving hints on the best way to use the product - very useful! The company suggested using the serum once a day in the morning, and I followed those directions. While I know that no product is going to change my face as a much as I would like (in my 60&#x27;s), I was really surprised the other day to notice that some wrinkles had diminished as had a dark spot on my face. The company states that the best results will be achieved by using the product for 30 days, so I am looking forward to seeing more improvement. I am also using this with the Amara Organics Anti Aging Face Cream Moisturizer. The price of both of these together is less than a single item of many other products. I really like that it is organic with no parabens, no alcohol, and no animal testing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going on my second bottle of the vitamin c serum.  Absolutely love this product.  A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product ..love it!!!</li>
    <li> I really like how it makes my skin feel tighter and look brighter. I like the fact that it boosts sun protection and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen no change in my skin since using this product. I&#x27;ve even had some break out, but that may be due to change of seasons (warm &amp; humid).</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It has helped lightened some of my dark spots that I&#x27;ve gotten from my pregnancy. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> 50+ male here who hates moisturizes. Prefer to just stay away from them until the skin is so dry I have to do something. Over the years have bought all kinds of things with some success from using Amazon reviews. Well, after a long hard winter, it was obvious I needed to something so I started the review search again. The regular store products usually irritated my skin or had scents I didn&#x27;t care for. Frankly, it was easier and less irritating to go without. After reading the reviews for this product, it wasn&#x27;t clear to me if this was a moisturizer. I had searched for oil free and this came up at the top. Seemed to be a skin serum and not a  lot emphasis on moisturizing.  I added another highly recommended moisturizer just in case. This is great for men because it is a moisturizer and in just the right amount while doing all kinds of good things to reduce signs of aging. It absorbs immediately, is dry within  30 seconds and does not leave an oily look or really any evidence that a product has been applied. There is no smell. It really does make the skin feel appropriately moisturized and gives a nice tight feel. This is definitely a product men should try if they are looking for facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  My face feels amazing.  Love it.</li>
    <li> From the first application to the following,  I could notice a better skin, more colorful and after 1 week I can notice very good results.  I am using only at night. No alergy no irritation.  Excelent formula.</li>
    <li> Great product to help fix skin pigmentation changes from the sun. My face feels much tighter and even since using this product.</li>
    <li> I felt the results very quickly after starting to use this serum.  My face/neck area are smoother and the skin tone is more even.  I will continue using and will likely reorder.  The serum was delivered more quickly than expected.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and I really like it. My skin feels very soft and not as dry. So far so good. The seller is very thoughtful and I received an email containing very useful and detailed instructions on how to use the product even before the product was delivered.</li>
    <li> This company has super wonderful customer service. I received and email from the co-founder (Jennifer) when I ordered, a quick response to my reply, and a follow up two weeks later to see how  I like the product and asking for general feedback. WOW! Who does this nowadays? I would definitely recommend ordering from Amara Organics.</li>
    <li> have hyperpigmentation and have tried everything without results I want.&#x27;ve tried several types of serum with vitamin C did not have the desired results, but decided to continue looking at this type of serums and after looking and looking I decided to try this Amara Organics because I liked the description of the product and good references! I have a week of use and I feel my skin feels super-calm and hydrated this is very important to me, I look clearer tone my face. I recommend this wonderful product because in a week I look at results, I will continue using this product! thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have been only using this serum for only a few weeks and I have noticed my skin looking more brighter and even toned! I also have been applying this serum to my hands and have noticed a considerable fading of my brown spots! Really love this product!!</li>
    <li> Used this for a litte over a month but couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! i absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. It helps get rid of my dark spots and my face is smoother than ever before..I would recommend this to everyone because it works great for me.. :)</li>
    <li> I have just placed and received my third order of this product. I believe it has improved the look of my skin. The product arrives promptly. Also, when first ordered I received a useful email from the seller, which was appreciated. After a good trial period I can report that I am happy I have found this vitamin C and E serum and will continue use of it.</li>
    <li> My mom said this one is very useful. So I bought one more to her.</li>
    <li> I found this product after some research because I wanted to add something different to my skin care regime and this is a really good product. It made my skin so bright and smooth that even my husband noticed a difference in my skin and kept complementing me and I&#x27;ve only used it for a month now. I&#x27;ve already ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Good stuff my wife and I use it, and  it works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 45 yr. old female who uses the serum every morning, after I get out of the shower. It spreads and absorbs easily and gives my skin a little glow. I&#x27;ve also noticed a more even tone and some diminishing line areas, especially around my mouth. The price is also very reasonable. I was also very impressed with the personal follow-up from Jennifer, a co-founder of Amara Organics.&lt;br /&gt;My second bottle should arrive any day and I look forward to seeing long term results!</li>
    <li> I saw improved in my skin, it brighter and smooth. Love it</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!  Took before and after photos 3 months apart, incredible difference.  Will continue to use this product,great results.</li>
    <li> I started using this about a month ago and really love the way it makes my skin feel! I believe that this product works really well and will continue to use it probably for the rest of my life as long as it&#x27;s available! I have very sensitive skin and this product is wonderful keeping my skin looking and feeling youthful! With continued use I&#x27;m sure I will see even more improvement on maintaining healthy, youthful skin . I&#x27;m 48 years old, used many products and never wrote a review about a product before. I love this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this helps or not. No obvious change on my face after 3 months. 25 years old male here.</li>
    <li> Miracle and it works within 5 days!!! You can actually see the results with your own eyes in couple of days :))!</li>
    <li> 33 year old sun loving, acne having smoker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started using this back in July. I noticed my fine lines reduced almost instantly. Acne was reduced to maybe one or two blemishes during my &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34;. Acne scars were almost gone after the first month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in dry Colorado, so moisturizer is a must. I use it after my serum has dried, which is almost instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been self-conscious about my skin. Never left the house without makeup. After the first couple months, I actually stopped wearing foundation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has it worked wonders for me, but the customer service from Jennifer, the co-founder, is pretty unbelievable. I&#x27;ve never waited more than a day for a response about questions and comments. She seems very sincere and genuine, and has made a life long customer out of me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It seems to make my skin look healthier.</li>
    <li> I received your product around 2 weeks ago, and started using it since I got it. It&#x27;s an amazing product. It make my skin smooth and softened. It can be absorbed by my skin easily, not sticky or oily, which is perfect for my combination skin. After using it for several days, my face is glowing. My friends told me I looked better. This product is such a surprise. I do love it. And thank you again for this opportunity of free trial. I will buy it again soon.</li>
    <li> I was introduced this Vitamin C srrum product by my friend.&lt;br /&gt;I am aware of my skin get improve and smooer by useing this serum.  T. M&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased to introduced</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST thing I have found for the fading of my scars! I&#x27;m in love with this product. Also, I use it on my face and it absorbs very well and quickly.</li>
    <li> I really have been loving my Vit C serum. Not only is it great for lightening my dark spots, but I can feel a little better knowing it is organic as well. The dropper lets me apply as much or as little as i want to my face without waste. It absorbs quickly so I can move on with the rest of my face routine both day and night. No harsh smells so it&#x27;s great for me. The additional Hyaluronic Acid is know to help with would healing so when i have those \\&quot;tiny\\&quot; (not) breakouts this helps calm it down. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinons</li>
    <li> Role this serum, use it immediately after using my derma roller. My skin feels and looks better then ever. I recommend this vitamin C serum, goes on so nice and your skin will feel better immediately.</li>
    <li> I have combined this with Yalmeh Super youth eye cream and wow, has my skin improved.  Diminishing of wrinkles and softer skin.  I am now on my second bottle!!! It made my skin feel better right away but took about 2 weeks to notice a visible difference.</li>
    <li> Good serum, light and easy to absorb</li>
    <li> The communication and shipping were fantastic. Reason for 4 stars is because I haven&#x27;t used very long and haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s effective after weeks of use. Certainly not as potent as other serums out there. But doesn&#x27;t hurt making it a part of facial care regime, it does have all the good ingredients in it. I do think I will buy again though.</li>
    <li> Now my skin get better I had T-sone sgin some of my skin so so dry ,and some area of my face start have wrinkle but after I use this vitamin c serum every morning and night it&#x27;s look great I will continue using the serum I&#x27;m happy now with my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitimin C Serum for about 4 months now and I really love the way it makes my skin look and feel... I&#x27;m 45 and  the serum helps me maintain a youthfull glow, it has really faded brown spots and sun spots  I use it as moisturizer every morning and I won&#x27;t go without it!</li>
    <li> Works very nicely to smooth my skin and make fine lines less obvious</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have noticed a different glow to my skin since using.  I&#x27;ve found that it works better with my creamy cleansers.  Not so much when I use black soap - leaves my face a bit too dry.</li>
    <li> I have to say, in a time when I have experienced more disappointing customer service than ever before, it is refreshing and much appreciated to have someone like Jennifer check up on this customer. I am very happy with the product. It does seem to calm my skin and keep it smoother than usual. I use it at night before bed with a moisturizer and use differin and a moisterizer w/sunblock in the morning. I have bought it twice from Amara and plan on purchasing it from them as I need refills. It arrived when promised and was superbly packaged. They followed up with each purchase and it was much more appreciated than you can imagine. Have a beautiful rest of your day!</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; fabulous, caring customer sevice!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m not sure what I can add to all of the favorable reviews, but in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, my 48 year old face looks visibly firmer and some discoloration spots are fading. I use it in the AM with Cerave sunscreen moisturizer on top. Love it! Great customer follow up as well.</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff!! It&#x27;s cleared up my lighter hyperpigmentation scars within about 2 weeks of daily use. I love that the odor isn&#x27;t strong, and that it&#x27;s gentle enough to use even twice a day without any issues. I find that patting it on the areas where my scars are is more effective than rubbing it in. It makes your face feel tight- which is totally normal. It has definitely become a staple in my skincare routine and I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> My skin appears a bit healthier after about three weeks of daily use of Amara&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for Face.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! Works wonders made my dark spots disappear!</li>
    <li> GREAT SERUM SMOOTHES MY SKIN RIGHT OUT</li>
    <li> I love this serum!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is getting smoother and my pores are getting tighter!</li>
    <li> The Amara Organics Vitamin C serum has worked wonders for my skin in the&lt;br /&gt;past year or so that I&#x27;ve been using it.. I&#x27;m even using it to replace my&lt;br /&gt;toner completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a wonderful/quality product!</li>
    <li> This stuff does wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> 72% Organic; are you kidding me! Since being diagnosed with breast Cancer 3 years ago&lt;br /&gt;and rejecting chemo, radiation and radical surgery, I strive to have all my beauty products as organic as possible.  The days of expensive salons, and hours in front of the mirror are OVER! I&#x27;ve had a wrinkle around my mouth for decades, and now it is barely visible while only using the product for a week. If you eat healthy, you shouldn&#x27;t have breakouts. No more expensive chemical products; they may work short term, but I believe in the long run you are destroying your skin, and could very well be making yourself sick.</li>
    <li> I think this product is working well for me and I will continue to buy it.  I think it helps with wrinkles and texture.</li>
    <li> My face feels smoother, firmer and complexion is brighter.</li>
    <li> I would say that I love this product and have ordered again.  it&#x27;s help with wrinkles and give a natural glow to the skin allows your face to feel heathy and clean.</li>
    <li> I am looking for an ORGANIC vitamin C serum.  This Amara product contains: phenoxyethanol. Phenoxyethanol has a &amp;#34;moderate&amp;#34; rating for overall health concerns and it can alter DNA. Phenoxyethanol is widely used in cosmetics despite FDA warnings.  FDA: The Food and Drug Administration has warned that the chemical is toxic to infants via ingestion, and &amp;#34;can depress the central nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea&amp;#34;. Since researching this chemical compound I will not purchase this poroduct. There are other more natural alternatives to this particular preservative that would be considered ORGANIC. I gave a 1 star rating so my comment would post. I now retract that.</li>
    <li> This is a great an wonderful product.  I use it every morning and I receive exceptional results!  I use Lancome Absolut Eye for my night cream, then in the a.m. I use this, let it dry, apply my sunscreen, whatever make-up for the day, although with this serum, I do not need to use much make-up at all.  I love, love, love this serum!!!!</li>
    <li> Just started using this product as part of a whole new skin care regimen.  I am very happy with the overall improvement in my skin so far (much more volume and brightness to my sun-damaged skin and noticeable softening of lines and wrinkles.)  I will absolutely continue to use this serum. I am also extremely impressed with the customer service of Amara Organics including a representative from the company e-mailing me personally to get my opinion on the product and see if I had any questions.</li>
    <li> Already seeing results within first week!</li>
    <li> Nice serum for the money. I use it night and day and when I use my dermal roller once a month.</li>
    <li> great product. My wife had some sunburn issues that were not going away with the other creams / moisturisers. This one helped her on the path to recovery. Also, it has put a glow on her skin tone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference since I use this.</li>
    <li> First, really fast shipping, I received this only two days after ordering! It is a glass bottle and syringe, safely packaged. It is small but you only need a finger tip amount for your face. Drys quickly. I have been using this now for only two days and WOW! I&#x27;m amazed! My skin is lighter, clearer, has a glow, and got rid of lines around my mouth, all after two days! I heard about this on Dr. Oz and read an article on Shakira&#x27;s beauty secrets and this was top of her list! I have to say I&#x27;m 20 years old and I love proactive, for keeping my skin flawless (when I do use it) but I wanted something less expensive, would work, and better for my skin (natural products) and this is it! It got rid of my breakouts! I&#x27;m so excited to see results with continued use and I will purchase this forever. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff is Amazing !! I order after a coworker told me about it  and I said what the heck let&#x27;s give it a shot. I have some dark spots from acne that I hate :( and after about a month of using it I can already see these fading away they are not completely gone but they&#x27;re almost there :) even my husband noticed my skin looking better. I&#x27;ll defenetly will buy again I have only used it for a month so I can&#x27;t wait to see more results !!!!</li>
    <li> Finding the best products to care for your skin can be difficult. Thinking about how much is absorbed through our skin into our bodies can be scary when we don&#x27;t know what all the ingredients are in our skin care products and whether or not they could be potentially harmful. At Amara Organics they believe in keeping things simple, down to earth and healthy for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their products are created of high quality natural and organic ingredients. Their carefully concocted skin care products not only contain great ingredients, they also deliver great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Amara Organics they believe the merits of a good product aren&#x27;t based solely on what IS in the product. They believe it has just as much to do with what is NOT in the product. Amara Organics never has any of the following harmful ingredients in their products:&lt;br /&gt;No Petrochemicals&lt;br /&gt;No Parabens&lt;br /&gt;No Artificial colors&lt;br /&gt;No Sodium Lauryl/Laureth Sulfates&lt;br /&gt;No DMDM Hydantoin/Diazonial Urea&lt;br /&gt;No EDTA&lt;br /&gt;No TEA, DEA, or MEA&lt;br /&gt;No Phthalates&lt;br /&gt;No Methylisothiazolineone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to test their Vitamin C Serum and was impressed with the product. It is meant to be applied to the face for cleansing and rejuvenation. Made with a high concentration of Vitamin C, E and Hyaluronic Acid this serum is meant to reverse the effects of aging and promote softer and more glowing skin after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like a lot to expect from this simple and natural solution but I was surprised that immediately after the first use my skin felt fresh, soft and clean.</li>
    <li> They send you a super helpful email about the product after purchase. It feels great and is high quality. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  In less than a week of use, I have noticed a significant change and have received comments from several people stating how great my skin looked.  I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I love it. My skin is softer and silkier. It absorbs quite quick so I can apply my moisturizer right after.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Vitamin C Serum for a week now and I&#x27;m really impressed with the results so far.  I&#x27;ve already noticed that my skin tone is more even and my skin actually looks a little brighter and healthier.  I was originally scowering amazon for some kind of miracle, all-natural, anti-aging cream and stumbled upon Vitamin C as a more natural alternative.  I have oily and combination skin and was nervous that a serum would cause my skin to break out or feel oily and it&#x27;s quite the opposite.  I apply at night and let the miracle serum work as I dream of sandy beaches.  I highly recommend this serum!</li>
    <li> No noticeable effects yet</li>
    <li> So far, I like it. I haven&#x27;t seen anything dramatic, but I don&#x27;t look for promises in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have never used a product with such quick results in reducing wrinkles! amazing product.  So much cheaper than all the other products I have used that did not even work.</li>
    <li> I like it because of the ingredients.. but so far i have not noticed any difference ... but maybe because I&#x27;m not consistent w it.. :)&lt;br /&gt;I try and use it on the deep like i have on my chest from tanning but so far nothing..</li>
    <li> I am 51 year old woman. This is a terrific product. Reduced skin ruddiness and breakouts on chin and cheeks. Skin is softer. Easy application. Absorbs quickly. No fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months, &amp; I am very pleased with the results that are now apparent.  The fine lines around my mouth have softened &amp; the few broken capillaries on my  cheeks have faded  quite a bit.  It quickly sinks into you skin leaving it with a nice plumped feeling.  Only a small amount is need to nicely cover your face &amp; neck.  I follow with a good moisturizer.  I am 71 &amp; have been doing facial exercises for many years.  This is one more helpful weapon to add to my age defying arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that the customer service with this company is excellent.  They are clearly proud of this product &amp; care about their customers.</li>
    <li> I did a bit of research on the use of Vitamin C for skin care (google Linus Pauling Institute) and Hyaluronic Acid then decided to search for a product that met my needs, Amara Organics is my choice and I am very pleased with the results. I use it twice a day and will continue. It is affordable and the bottle lasts a long time. My skin seems to be much healthier looking and much softer.</li>
    <li> Love the product and appreciate the merchant giving directions on use with the derma roller. Very helpful!</li>
    <li> Thrilled that this product is Vegan b/c my mother in law is Vegan and always used Aveda products but I wanted to find something one step better and this is it! Very pleased with the smell/texture and make my face feel wonderful. Can&#x27;t wait for her to open her Christmas present!</li>
    <li> So far I feel I am noticing a difference in the texture of my skin and seeing my lines start to fade. It has only been about a month but I&#x27;m very happy with my product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Not greasy or oily. Goes on nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It absorbs beautifully into my skin, and I have noticed an amazing difference in the texture of my skin. I look radiant and my husband has noticed the change and has complemented how much younger I look since I have been using this product. I have only used this product for about 3 weeks and I will continue to use it every day!</li>
    <li> Very good serum !! It does work !!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for two weeks or so, and although my skin seems to be improving, I CANNOT STAND the SMELL of the serum. It almost smell as if it has gone sour. So sadly I will stop using it as I cannot continue to put it on my and smell it.. yikes!!!</li>
    <li> Great solution for lightening dark skin spots. The company is very caring to their customers.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  It is light weight, non sticky and absorbs into the skin.  I feel a bit of tightening but it is because the serum is drying.  I apply my foundation/ tinted moisturizer over it without issue if I decide go out.  I have compared this product to another Vitamin C serum and I prefer this one.  No peeling, no flaking...buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> Got Dermatitis with this Vitamin C Serum on the base of my nose in the spring and it&#x27;s still here! I tried cortisone cream, antibiotics, and still am struggling with it. I did blow my nose beacuse of spring allergy, and both of them did the trick I think. Look for other way to beautify your skin. I will post when it&#x27;s clear, it&#x27;s hard to think when that is going to be.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! We have used it for about 6 months and dark spots on face are really really faded.</li>
    <li> Great serum. Good caring company also.</li>
    <li> Great texture and feels like it sinks in well. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasiness. Highly recommend as a great C serum.</li>
    <li> Second bottle an and I HOPE this product stays as easy to find as it is in Amazon. I&#x27;ve purchased bottles for family and they all love it as well.  Let me add, that the customer service is impeccable as well. An email from the company checking up on my satisfaction and a quick &amp;#34;note&amp;#34; in my reply that I was bummed I spilled half of my second purchased bottle prompted the president of the company to offer me a new one!  ....now as far as what it does, VERY little needed, soaks right in then use my regular products over. Skin feels softer, more &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and I do believe I see softening of even some of my deeper lines (not an overnight solution, but natural, subtle and inexpensive one!) also love that using it in the morning adds another layer of sun protection!) HIGHLY reccommend!!</li>
    <li> I have oily, sensitive skin that breaks out very easily... my concern with all treatments like these are will they break out my face.  So far it has not done that and that&#x27;s half the battle.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Feels great on your skin and has a nice smell to it.  Right after I ordered the Vitamin C serum the owner of the company sent me a detailed email telling me exactly how to get the best results and to contact them with any questions.  After a few weeks of using the product, I got another email asking how I liked it and if I had any questions.  This is a company that really cares about it&#x27;s products and the customers who use them.  I am going to be ordering more serum when I run out and will definitely order other products from Amara Organics.</li>
    <li> So far, I like it. The consistency is just right,not too runny as some c-serums out there. Feels great.</li>
    <li> I like this serum, better than the other I tried.  It absorbs into my skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I usually pile another moisturizer over the serum because I have dry skin.  It works great in the summer season but I need a more powerful hydrating serum to lock in the moisture in the winter.  That&#x27;s why I took a star off.  Wish it could contain hyaluronic acid.</li>
    <li> Saw immediate improvement in my skin,  and after just a few weeks of using, sun spots are fading &amp; pores are shrinking!</li>
    <li> Good product concentrated so u don&#x27;t need to use a lot. Skin appears to be more clearer. So far so good</li>
    <li> Spouse has sensitive skin and he is very happy with product after other products were too strong for him. Just a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I turned 30 this year and suddenly realized that I needed a new skin care regimen. I used proactiv before and would get all these little bumps all over my forehead. I found out I needed to ditch the proactiv which was drying my skin and causing it to produce more oil which created the bumps, and exfoliate and moisturize a lot. I did, but my skin still looked dull to me. I decided to try this and literally woke up the next morning touching my forehead amazed at how good my skin felt. Soft and smooth!How was that, I don&#x27;t know. I use this only at night so far as I&#x27;d been told serums should go on before bed. My skin is so much prettier. Just smooth and more radiant than it&#x27;s been in a long time. I am very glad I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> Just started to use it, without any allergic reaction, will keep updating the review soon!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see it making any difference to my skin after several weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I have used very expensive vitaminC from my plastic surgeon but it didn&#x27;t have as much of an effect as this product.  Love it</li>
    <li> It dries my face in 5 minutes.  I stopped using this.  I also bought Valentia&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum which is way better than this.</li>
    <li> This helped lighten my dark freckles but not totally erase them. I like how it keeps my skin hydrated with out heavy cream feeling.</li>
    <li> This serum is definitely helping my skin to look and feel younger and more smooth!</li>
    <li> Phenominal product!  I used for 2 weeks until I accidentally broke the bottle when it fell on my tile.  I was already getting compliments on my skin.  Great product and great price!!</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 days. After spraying on my toner, I dab a few drops on my fingertips and blend in with the toner. After about 10 seconds I apply the rest of my skin care regime. I find the serum especially beneficial around my lips after brushing my teeth to keep soft and moisturized. Love it so far.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my face, tightens the skin!  If you want a longer lasting result you woukd need to step it up and get a laser treatment or something similar!  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is only the first night i tried it so my review will change if i dont see any good results. BUT out of all the other vitamin c serums i have tried off amazon, this is the thickest one. It is still watery but glides on very well, sort of feels like a glycerin texture.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Great experience with the seller.  I have been using this product for quite some time now.  I wanted to see if it was a temporary effect.  My dark spots were lightened, my skin smoother and a remarkable notice in the wrinkles.  I love the fact that I can still use my usual facial lotion that contains sunblock.  The seller sent a personal email advising how best to use it.  It was packaged very well and delivered as promised.  It comes with a dropper and a regular screw cap.  The dropper allows for easy application, and the cap comes in handy when you take it on vacation.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2EPJBR5PTFPAR]]I am 51 years young, and I have used other expensive products and I was always disappointed.  Some products was very harsh on my skin, others gave me acne, and dried up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Amara Organics for a month now, and I have gotten a lot of complements from friends and strangers about my  radiant glowing skin.  My friends asked me if I had work done on my face because it looks so youthful.  I use Amara every morning as directed, and my face feels very fresh all day. In the morning when I awake, my face looks like it has been washed and ready for the day.  I recommend using this product and I will continue using it.  Thank you for making such a great product.</li>
    <li> Arrived pretty quick! So far I like the product but have only been using it for a few days, will review again after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Have been using product for a week. Seems smooth, dries quickly. It says put moisturizer on after it dries. THis product is similar to one I paid much more for and quit using because of the high price. Hoping this is just as good and I can afford to stay on it. I know Vit c and hyaluronic acid are great for all cells to rejuvenate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a cracked top when it arrived. Just so happened that I got a follow up call from the company and when they heard that it was received even slightly amiss they sent an additional bottle out that I received in 2 days. Followed up by email again. That is great customer service and if the product works well will make me a life long customer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum. After using it for only a couple of weeks my face is feeling and looking much healthier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. You can feel that it absolves right away and no oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;Plan to get another product from this brand!&lt;br /&gt;A good purchase!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I felt the difference on my skin just after 3 days. I have acne problems and using vitamin C as a support to get rid of them. It made my face look clearer and made it soft. The red acne scars looks less reddish. I strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Just purchased this vitamin C serum and just after 1 use my skin was softer. Cant wait to see how well it works long term. Another bonus was the email sent from company rep about how to use the product and other facts. So far a great buy.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday.  Excellent product</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have been using it on my face and have noticed smother skin.  I have also used it on a few scars on my hands and they are fading a little each day.</li>
    <li> No work for me. I use a no see any change or improve in my skin.</li>
    <li> Upon application, this serum has a light, gel-like consistency, it is moisturizing and scent free. This is great for sensitive skin, it is gentle enough with no irritation on skin despite the ingredients. It is soothing to tired skin, it moisturizes my skin just right without leaving it greasy neither does it leave it tight or dry. After using it consistently, it left my skin soft, supple and with a nice subtle glow. It’s a great product for healthy appearing skin. I think this product is appropriate for those with dry-combo skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Oreleona&lt;br /&gt;[Product provided for free for testing purposes]</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I do not see a decrease in lines, but my skin is 100% smoother.  I&#x27;ve been using for approximately 6 weeks.  They say with these products, you need to give it at least 6 months.  I just ordered my 2nd bottle....</li>
    <li> I will say that I am pleased with the&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Serum from Amara Organics. Within 2 weeks I have&lt;br /&gt;noticed a even and smooth effect it is having on my skin. I look forward to seeing continued results.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Works beyond my expectations!</li>
    <li> im using the second bottle, and i still didn&#x27;t see the result!</li>
    <li> This product is great and it really helps with healing and removing scars from acne. I love it I use it at least 3 times a week so that it can last long.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Once again falling for fads. Ugh.</li>
    <li> This made my skin soft and reduced the redness!</li>
    <li> Smells funky, but they refunded w/o a problem!</li>
    <li> Been using this for about 4 weeks.  My skin feels softer, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any other benefits yet.</li>
    <li> My skin looks great.  I use this in the morning and retinol in the evening.  Great combo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service and very responsive to questions!  Great!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. It takes care of sun blemishes and other skin issues. It makes your skin look much healthier and has no chemicals.  Will continue to purchase this product.  Wish they would make a larger size bottle so it will last longer on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amara Organics for this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Hey Girls!!!! I bought this Vitamin C Serum and used it for 2 weeks, morning and night. People started saying my skin looked like the skin of a 30 year old. Im in my 50&#x27;s!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s incredible!!!</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product so I guess that means five stars. I waited for a month of use before reviewing to see what kind results I got. So far so good. I have very sensitive/reactive skin and really don&#x27;t like most cosmetic smells. This product feels soft, pure and non agitating. You will notice softness immediately. I am skeptical when people say they saw radical results.....it was not my expectation...I do feel fairly certain there is a modest improvement in texture and tone over the last 30 days. I plan to keep on using it and will likely order more. I am not a blogger/did not receive this product free for a review. Just a person trying to give 56 year old skin a boost without a plastic surgeon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle now over a few months and it didn&#x27;t change anything on my skin.  Customer service is excellent and it seems to work for so many others, but felt I should let you know that for some people, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I unfortunately was not much for one to think that skincare that was gentle, vegan, and natural could actually garner results.  I was wrong.  Amara&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum for face is a lightweight, ultra hydrating serum that softens, brightens and aids in the textural changes of your skin.  The texture of the serum itself was liquid, but had some viscosity for hold.  It also was fast absorbing and left no tackiness on my skin.  There is a mild scent to this that is somewhat herbal, but it is very subtle and wore away rather quickly after application.  Amara&#x27;s serum also played very well with my other skincare and did not notice any reactions.  From using this, I have improved texture...there are less bumps and dry areas on my face.  The fine lines around my eyes appear plumper.  The hyaluronic acid contained within the serum really does help to hydrate and I notice that I do not have to use as much of my skincare as I used to before.  XSmoother, brighter skin without chemicals...?  I will definitely take it.  Item was sent by company for purposes of review.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this. I know nothing about it.</li>
    <li> Good product and excellent follow up by Amara.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every morning and night, I have seen absolutely no change in my skin, no brightening and no tightening!! Very disappointing, waste of money!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Vitamin C serum by Amara Organics. This is my second bottle. I love the way it makes my skin feel, how smooth my skin is and the fact that I have seen those fine lines around my eyes and the frown lines slowly disappear with continued use of the product. What a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a facelift but it helps. I&#x27;m a 68-year-old woman and it helps me look like an attractive 68-year-old with a good complexion. I&#x27;ve used many high-end face care products and this is my favorite and much less expensive than others I have used. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month and there&#x27;s been a noticeable improvement in my complexion.  My skin is clearer and smoother.  When you first put it on, you really notice the brightening effect it has. I&#x27;ve found that dulls a little when I put my regular moisturizer on top (I use Eminence Organic moisturizers), but I&#x27;m on the hunt for a lighter day cream that might work better with this serum.  Definitely a good purchase :)</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly. The serum helps the skin. I will buy more of it.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  My skin feels and looks firmer.</li>
    <li> Purchased twice. Use daily</li>
    <li> First of all, please let me state how impressed with your customer service and attention I am.  In this day and age it is something that is truly lacking from most business interactions.  It goes a long way with me, and I thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has been a true blessing.  When I purchased the vitamin C serum, it was as an add on to a derma roller that I purchased on a particularly self-conscious day I was having.  At the time I had more hopes for the derma roller than I did the serum.  I’ve never had luck with many beauty products in the past, and I thought this would be much the same in spite of the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these products to help rid my facial skin of mild discoloration and dark spots due to years of sun exposure and medication.  I have used the derma roller 3 times, but have noticed no improvement that I would associate with it.  But since I first received your product, I have been using it daily for about 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this serum I would have to apply concealer, then foundation, then touch up with concealer again in order to cover the dark spots.  After just three weeks of use I can now use just a light foundation or tinted moisturizer and achieve the same effect as all the caked on makeup I would previously use.  My skin feels better, and I feel better about myself.  I’ve even been going to the gym without makeup on for the first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your product has made a huge difference in my self-confidence.  I intent to be a long term customer and research other product options as well.</li>
    <li> this product has definitely improved my skin tone! I do use retinol at night and this is my addition during the day.  love it love it love it!</li>
    <li> A few reviews said they broke out...well this took care of a weird break out I had. It has toned my skin, less lines, and looks very even toned. Been using it for 3 weeks. Not sticky , dries fast.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY vitamin C serum I buy. It is reasonably priced and it works! Helps fade brown spots without the stinging.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff!  I have been using it for just a few weeks and have already noticed a big  difference in my skin. My pores are smaller and fine lines are going away and it even has helped my extremely chapped lips that are an effect of medication I have to take.  I&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I use it every morning. It feels soft and makes my face glow. I can also see a reduction in fine lines.</li>
    <li> easy to apply and makes your skin look and feel great!</li>
    <li> It is not as good as the OZ product I purchased before.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Vitamin C Serum. I am completely satisfied and will continue to order in the future.</li>
    <li> compare to what I call a real vitamin c, this does not meet the test, it feels like it only contains .01 percent of vita c and the rest textured with watery additives.</li>
    <li> This serum has a light silky consistency and no fragrance or odor. I need something lightweight for oily skin and this works perfectly! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I love that it&#x27;s organic, made in the U.S., and NOT tested on animals!</li>
    <li> Update: 04/30/15 Changed from 5 stars to 4. Purchased and used up my second bottle and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve continued to see you the same results. My skin didn&#x27;t seem as &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; as before when I was on the first bottle and I&#x27;m no longer noticing any fading of old acne scars, but maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much. Anyways, I decided to try a different brand (insta natural) with more vitamins and natural oils for more &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; benefits. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, just wanted to prevent . Big mistake! My skin felt awful with the other product and I began breaking out. With the insta natural brand my makeup caked up and smeared and I looked like a greaseball, even without makeup I looked greasy. My previous review I stated that I thought this brand (Amara Organics) made me break out at first but that it had gotten better. I couldn&#x27;t give the other brand the chance that I had given this brand because my face felt too oily and itchy. I&#x27;m coming back to this product (Amara) since it worked well with my skin type, but I&#x27;ll probably continue to look for something that might be better.   Old review: My skin needed some serious help. I have oily, acne-prone skin and large pores. The hormones from having kids made me look like I had the skin of a teenager again...and the scars it left behind!! I was so embarrassed. I didn&#x27;t want to spend hundreds on more peels and laser treatments at the spa and I remember a friend raving about vitamin C for skin care. After looking on Amazon for a while, this seemed to be the best rated so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Honestly, at first I was disappointed. I thought it was making me break out again so I quit using it after only a few uses. I&#x27;m not sure what really caused the breakouts but I decided to give this another chance after I had the breakouts under control. I&#x27;m so happy I did. I can&#x27;t say that I saw any immediate results, but after a couple weeks I noticed that my skin looked brighter and my pores appear much smaller. I also notice that my skin feels less oily throughout the day (I used to have to blot my face every few hours and now it&#x27;s very rare that I have to) and I&#x27;m not breaking out at all. I&#x27;m noticing that some acne scars are becoming lighter too. I use this under my makeup during the day and at night I use a retinol cream (but I&#x27;ve been using the retinol for a while and have only noticed results after adding this serum). The company sends an email with instructions and does advise that this serum is thinner and a little goes a long way. It also recommends to use it during the day, especially if you use a retinol at night. This is probably one of my best skin care purchases in a long time. I just ordered a second bottle and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll continue to order it as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is great in my skin.  After few days of applying it, i can see the difference.  My skin start to getting clearer because I have spots from break outs.  It helps.  I&#x27;ll order again definitely.</li>
    <li> My skin looks great! Loved the product</li>
    <li> i like it and there is no bad smell.</li>
    <li> Love the product and was quite impressed with the fact that upon receipt of I was contacted by email with detailed directions for the best application of this product.</li>
    <li> I have two brown spots on my face and I have used all kinds of products to help get rid of the spots.  I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for about one month.  So far, one of the spots is almost gone and the other one has lighten a bit.  I will continue to use the Serum as I believe another month will make additional improvements.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Feel my face looks brighter and healthy. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used different brands of non organic vitamin C serum and hardly saw a difference in my skin. I have some skin discolorations and I&#x27;ve been using the serum daily according to instructions. I have noticed light peeling of my skin thereby lightening the discolorations. I am just on my third week of using this product but I can already see and feel visible results. I also apply it after derma rolling once a week and it doesn&#x27;t sting when applied right after rolling.</li>
    <li> Very thin serum with minimal effects after month of use.  Would not buy again!</li>
    <li> I have had a hard time with Vitamin C serums because they have a tendency to really dry my skin out.  This product has been great and comes in stable packaging.</li>
    <li> Great product that actually works. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky. After just a short time I can already see a difference. Skin looks smoother and brighter. I&#x27;m outdoors a lot so I like that it helps protect from sun damage in addition to sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Great-and magical too-product.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and great customer service!</li>
    <li> So far, I like this product...haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a long term evaluation but it feels really good on skin.</li>
    <li> Used for 3 months and did not notice any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> This product does everything it claims.  I have been using for about 2 months on my face, neck and upper chest.  I started seeing improvement in my upper chest area within 2-3 weeks.  This area has a lot of sun exposure over the years and it shows.  Since starting the Vitamin C Serum nightly I have less &amp;#34;old lady skin&amp;#34; appearance on my chest.  I have always taken extra care with my face and neck area so the improvement has been more subtle, most noticeable would be the improvement to a surgical scar.  Overall my skin is soft, smooth and even toned, the fine lines around the eyes are improving. The best part is all this great skin care at a great price.  I have tied expensive imported products with OK results after many months, The Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum gave results quickly, is quick and easy to purchase and the company follows up with you via e-mail to ensure you understand how to use their product and are happy with the results, without pushing you to buy anything else (That&#x27;s priceless).</li>
    <li> Very happy with product and service! FYI...top was sealed :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing. I&#x27;m a mother of twins and ever since I was pregnant my face had never been the same due to the overwhelming amount of harmonies that comes with pregnancy. This serum has made me feel like I did back in my 20&#x27;s, young and beautiful. I must say lately I&#x27;m being idolized by those much younger than myself. Thank you Amara Organics for giving me back my youth without having to spend the Spa price.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a speedy delivery! Love all Amara Products. I use this amazing Vitamin C Serum together with Amara Eye Gel and Amara Moisturizer. I love that this product is natural organic unlike other expensive Serums that I have bought at different department stores that are full of chemicals and toxins that only irritate your skin. I have redness around my cheeks and since using this serum for over two weeks now, I have noticed a decrease in the redness. Vitamin C Serum stimulates collagen and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. This serum has also helped diminish my age spots and darkness under my eyes. Just a small pump goes a long way. I use it at night and in the morning before applying my moisturizer and makeup.  There is no oily residue. I just love it. I&#x27;m 63 years old and I can feel my skin radiant and youthful. Thanks for the email with all your information and instructions on how to apply the serum. It was very helpful. Great customer service. I give this wonderful miracle product 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this product use with the  derma roller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a month...but I can see a difference and so can others.  People are telling me how good I look...Love it !</li>
    <li> Amazing serum! It makes my skin feel like porcelain and my pores have almost vanished. I have only used it for a few weeks so far and I am very impressed. I have very fair, very sensitive skin and this Vitamin C serum from Amara Organics doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or make me break out. In fact, it has cleared my face up! I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles yet, maybe just a few fine lines, but even those look like they&#x27;re disappearing!  I am so hooked!  It&#x27;s such a good price, too, and the customer service is excellent! I received an email explaining the benefits of and the best time to use the serum (in the morning). I sometimes use it twice a day because it feels so good on my face. I have never written a review for a product before but honestly, the great reviews were what made me try it in the first place. I am so happy I did; my skin looks better than it ever has! I will definitely continue to use this serum and recommend it to my family and friends! I love it!</li>
    <li> Seemed like a great serum but the bottle fell and broke just a couple of days after I bought it. So I&#x27;m not sure how it really works.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell it did anything for me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it faithfully everyday for the past two months&lt;br /&gt;It does make a difference</li>
    <li> it is magical produce.</li>
    <li> I am with the other 1 star reviewers. Vitamin C oxidizes way too fast and therefore is useless and even harmful to your skin. I am questioning the quality of it. In any case, I did my research and now make my own Vitamin C, since most of Vitamin C sold online that don&#x27;t have ferulic acid (acid that helps to prevent Vitamin C from oxidizing) are harmful. Please do your research before buying. Any Vitamin C that have ferulic acid or other preservatives in, cost a lot of money, not even close to $20-40 you pay for this one.</li>
    <li> This is helping my face and neck look more supple and smooth! I really like it! My family and friends wonder what I am doing to my face.</li>
    <li> The very best product ever for my skin ever, particularly around the eye area.  Thanks for the fast shipping!!  PS  And I don&#x27;t mind admitting that I just celebrated my 77th birthday and no one believes me!</li>
    <li> Amazing! My face feels soft and silky.. I couldnt tell at first how it was doing on the appearance until my coworker mentioned a few days ago that my skin looked refreshed.. thats a great compliment now that Im in my thirties and beginning to feel the effect of aging! Will be buying some for the ladies in my family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is Amara Organics really care about their customers and their product. They checked in to see how I was doing with the product and if I had any questions. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Was hoping this would be an answer to some minor issues with the face but as always it wasn&#x27;t. I did like the way it made the surface of the skin feel. Less bumpy and a little smoother but it did nothing with some minor age spots on the face. Didn&#x27;t do anything for wrinkles either. I followed the instructions to the \\&quot;t\\&quot; but didn&#x27;t get the results I was hoping for. This isn&#x27;t the first time I have tried something that promises to do great things and then have it fall short of the mark. I guess I expect too much from products that promise a lot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok - not totally impressed with what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Spreads well but dries out the skin. Needs re formulation!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, but I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference. My skin glows using this serum. And the customer service is wonderful, always making sure their customers are satisfied. I am. I couldn&#x27;t be more ssatisfied. They have a customer for life.</li>
    <li> its been a month.it cleaned my acnes a little bit. im not sure i didnt feel too much positive progress</li>
    <li> I love this serum!!  I use it every night and I truly feel like it makes my skin softer and smoother!</li>
    <li> My face has improved tremendously with the use of this serum</li>
    <li> it made break out every time I used it.</li>
    <li> I do not see any difference yet, what i like about it is that is not greasy  , will see later if has any effect on my skin</li>
    <li> Quick, kind service and great product.  I use this product in the morning after toner and it makes my face feel soft and lifted.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Good transaction.  Will order again :-)</li>
    <li> Received merchandise In expedient time.&lt;br /&gt;Have only used vitamin C serum 4 or 5 days.  Too soon to tell if it really works.</li>
    <li> Great serum can see the difference</li>
    <li> Love this serum, I have a lot of lines and sun damage and this has softened the lines and is already evening out the tone in just a short time will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times and I&#x27;m amazed at how much better my skin looks!!! I&#x27;ve lost the ashy tired look and have color and glow to my skin again.  Even fading my melasma!! I&#x27;m sold!  :)</li>
    <li> I just got this product and have used it for a few days now. I like it and can already tell that it&#x27;s starting to make my skin look better. I like the way it feels and how it dries quickly. My makeup goes on smooth over it as well. If it works this well after just a few days, I can&#x27;t wait to see how good my skin will look after a few months. I also appreciated that Amara Organics sent me an email when the product shipped with instructions on how to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this every day to prevent sun damage and wrinkles. It dries fast with a matte finish and I apply a moisturizer with sunscreen after. I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles so I can&#x27;t comment on whether it helps that, but it has made a difference in my skin texture. My skin is smoother and looks more vibrant. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells so I appreciate when products aren&#x27;t scented.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for several weeks now and really like it. I love that the serum is easily absorbed by the skin. I use my moisturizer right over the top. I have been using this in the mornings as the product info state&#x27;s it helps to increase your sun protection. I am 67 yrs. old and have recently noticed small brown spots on my forehead. I am hoping that within time these will begin to fade while using this serum. I am glad that I ordered this!</li>
    <li> I am 62 years old and have been trying to take better care of my skin.  I have recently tried other products (from chemical peels to anti-wrinkle cream) with no results and even negative results. With this product I have already seen positive results in only a little over a week.  Most noticeable is the lessening of a fold or crease just under my eyes along side my nose.  The small lines around the outside of my eyes have all but disappeared.  I have also noticed some of the dark spots fading.  My skin feels healthier.  I will continue to use and recommend this serum.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  May 17, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I am still using the serum every day.  The positive results have continued.  The fine lines around my eyes are gone and the wrinkles around my mouth are diminishing. The brown patches continue to fade.  The best part is that I very rarely wear makeup any more because my skin looks so good. The second bottle confused me because the liquid was cloudy.  I checked with other Amazon users and found that this was normal.  The liquid in my first bottle was completely clear.  I was concerned that I did not get the benefit of all the ingredients so I contacted Amara Organics.  They are sending a replacement bottle.  Great product and great service -- I will be using this product until I can no longer take care of myself.</li>
    <li> Fantastic serum.Makes my skin bright and clean looking.Combined with hyaluronic acid for moisturizing,it is just a simple formula with all great benefits! I&#x27;ve tried other vitamin c skin stuff but they all are too strong or do nothing.I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this one and love love it.I plan on being addicted for a long time :-)...I&#x27;ve been following after with grape seed oil as a final moisturizer which is really calming after the vitamin c but wait like 20 min for the vitamin c to do its thing.</li>
    <li> I would say that this has helped diminish the appearance of the fine lines around my eyes.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has definitely become a part of my daily morning regiment........After a bad bout with adult acne I have been trying everything to get my face to feel normal again.............I like the way this feels and I will be purchasing more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old so I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about face treatments.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Some work well while others don&#x27;t.  If you are looking for one that will help smooth aged skin, this will work! This product would be for all skin types. I have recently been breaking out on my chin (yes, even at 52!) and I was really worried about the texture of this product.  I was relieved when I first used it and found that it literally goes on like a silky liquid and sinks right in. You don&#x27;t feel anything on your skin.  I use it under my sunscreen and oil-free foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1  month now at I will be honest...the results are not overnight but if you keep faithfully using, you will be very pleased with the product.  You have to be patient and keep using it for at least two weeks to see great results.  However, if you do use it faithfully everyday, you will definitely see results!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I noticed was when I was at work and went into the restroom.  As every gal knows, lighting in the restrooms can be very unflattering.  Well, I looked in the mirror as I was washing my hands and thought, \\&quot;Oh my gosh, my skin is glowing and in this terrible light!\\&quot;  That&#x27;s when I knew it was the product working because it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve done differently with my skin routine in the last 6 months.  The area where I&#x27;ve seen the most improvement is the area around the corner of the eyes and down toward the top of the cheek bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to repurchase this product and continue to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my skin in just two weeks. I will continue to purchase this product. The price is right too.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of skinceuticals, and use it as part of my daily regimen (cleanse, toner, eye cream, moisturizer).  I couldn&#x27;t see spending over $100 for the vitamin C.  Decided to try this product after the great reviews.  Worth it!  I noticed a softer feel in my overall texture in one week.  I have acne, and have not experienced any problems with sensitivity.  I also wear contacts and it does not irritate them when I start to perspire or tear up due to allergies (certain products have done that, mainly moisturizers).  Thought it was worth mentioning if you are sensitive to a variety of products.  I am not sure if it is the sunny weather, or the serum, but I have noticed that my scarring has slightly lightened/softened.  I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Love the product - received a compliment about my skin, while in line at a drugstore, and was asked what I did to make my skin glow!</li>
    <li> So happy that I decided to purchase this particular vitamin c serum after doing some research online and comparing ingredients. I was very impressed with the company, Amara Organics. They send an email prior to receipt of their product explaining how to use it. Love the way it feels on my skin - looks smoother after one use and leaves no film or greasy feel on your face.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!</li>
    <li> I m adding it daily to my moisturizer. .Skin looking GREAT..</li>
    <li> Great product, I am satisfied. :-)</li>
    <li> Great product.  Follow up from the amara was amazing.</li>
    <li> Hoping to see the results soon.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy, soaks right in, my face feels so soft with no residue.  I think I can already see an improvement in my skin.This ones a keeper!</li>
    <li> I love the product, and it arrived right away!!!</li>
    <li> Not greasy, nice scent, smooth skin, nice product, very satisfied, would recommend to other people. Well worth the wait and price.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see much change on my skin</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use it on my hands too and it really helps my sun damage.</li>
    <li> Needed the vitamin c to try to even out and moisturize the face.  This does work - doesn&#x27;t perform miracles - but works.  I like the packaging and the product is well formulated and feels quite nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> been 2 weeks so far. its more of a thin gel consistency.  one of the ingredients is Aloe Vera Gel which is probably why it feel like a gel, but Im hoping that the main ingredient is still vitamin C.  it goes on smoothly and dries within 1-2min.  havent seen a change yet..but will keep using for another 4weeks and report back.</li>
    <li> dont see result, but feels ok.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. My skin looks more clear and it is DEFINITELY softer. I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; difference on my face since I started using this product.  It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for over a month on a couple of &amp;#34;liver spots&amp;#34; on my face. I have not seen the slightest change whatsoever. I&#x27;m starting to think just some gentle exfoliating  with a mild solution of lemon juice would work much quicker and be much less expensive than this little bottle. I know some reviewers love it, but so far I am not feeling I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of this &amp;#34;magic eraser&amp;#34; last month. I&#x27;ve used it every morning after my regular cleansing and toning routine and my first bottle was getting low so I just ordered another to make darn sure I don&#x27;t run out! This product is wonderful and already, in less than a month, I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the tone and texture of my skin. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed the disappearance of the fine lines and even some of the bigger ones around my eyes that, at 45, I am happily saying goodbye to!!! Good stuff here ladies (and gentlemen - you all want to look great too, I&#x27;m sure!).... It&#x27;s light and smooth and your skin just drinks it up. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very good serum, absorbs quickly and does not tight the skin.</li>
    <li> Really works on lightening acne and sun spots as well as tightening your face.  I will differently continue to order and use.</li>
    <li> Love it! I use this as directed, I am liking the results.</li>
    <li> I love all my Amara Organic prodoucts.  This really helps keep my skin healthy and happy.  It works great under my daily moisturizer and really makes my dry skin look great!</li>
    <li> great product even after just 2 weeks. very good effect with the once weekly micro needling&lt;br /&gt;much better than more expensive products</li>
    <li> This is by far the most effective, conscientious and comprehensive anti aging C serum I have had the pleasure of using...and I have tried them all...SUPER customer service too!!!</li>
    <li> used for 2 months and see no change on my face</li>
    <li> I love this product! Was so pleased with the quick delivery. I have and will continue to use and recommend this product to others!  I have noticed a great difference in the general appearance of my skin, and it softens it so! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> happy with the product</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this. It simply does not work. I have tried vitamin c serums that has given me results in a matter of three days. This has no positive effects on my skin it&#x27;s just sticky and makes me feel to wash my face. It a very dirty feeling when I apply this I rather pay a higher price and buy a proper vitamin c serum.</li>
    <li> Love it leaves my face smooth</li>
    <li> My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> I am 66 years of age.  My aim is to hopefully &amp;#34;age gracefully&amp;#34; without &amp;#34;major interventions&amp;#34; as such, I  look for products that will help me realize this goal. I  had  previously tried a Vitamin C Serum purchased locally (at a SPA)  and while I liked its effects, I found it very costly.  This prompted me to do some research which  is how I  found &amp;#34;Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum&amp;#34;.  I have been using it for several  weeks now and, quite frankly,found it to be better than the one I purchased from the SPA !  I like the way it brightens my skin and provides an almost  firming-like effect.  Adding this  Vitamin C Serum  to my daily routine has proven positive.  It should be noted that most products will not turn the clock back  years but some can certainly slow the process  and I think this is one of them.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> love that this is not greasy and i can wear under makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any different in my face, it dose tighten the skin without moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This may be the solution for younger skin...definitely made skin glowy, clearer and smoother!! I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with the derma rollers of .05 and 1.0 twice a week for a month now and the results are amazing. I&#x27;ve even been using it on 20 and 30 year old scars and he combo of using both the derma roller and the serum have actually reduced the visable area and site of 2 primary scars I have by at leas a third if not by half,,, I can only imagine a couple of months more how smooth and undetectible they may end up...good stuff</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, i think the test of fire is going through chemotherapy and using this product&lt;br /&gt;daily. I read the description and peoples&#x27; evaluation and went for it. I was very pleased, I did not have side effects such as spots or skin discoloration, and I think Vitamin C serum from Amara Organics had a lot to do with it. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I really love this. I have had a few age spots on my face that nothing could get rid of. I have used this 3 times and already they have faded to where you can hardly see them. I&#x27;m amazed at how fast it worked. It also has started to get rid of the few wrinkles I have. It&#x27;s truly amazing stuff! !</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I love it and will definitely keep ordering it.  It does make a difference, my skin looks great and has a glow.  Yup, great product</li>
    <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to know if a serum is really doing anything.  they all tout how important they are and how they are so beneficial for your skin; but frankly, I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and I never notice anything specific in regards to softer lines, better pores, reduction of age spots or improvements to the skin.  but I do know from dermatologists and estheticians that certain ingredients are good for the skin like Vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid, and Vitamin E, and this product incorporates all those ingredients for a more reasonable price than many on the market.  So most of the time if I like a serum it&#x27;s for the fragrance or feel of it.  that&#x27;s why I gave a 3 star rating...because the consistency is watery and doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance which is not a negative but just a fact.  I&#x27;m not crazy about how it feels right when I put it on (slightly sticky) but it seeps into the skin in seconds and once I put my moisturizer on, it doesn&#x27;t matter.  Since it has all the right ingredients, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s helping my skin...I&#x27;m just not seeing any marked improvements that I can tell.  I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for several months now and no signs of any reduction of the aging brown spots or that &#x27;youthful glow&#x27; they claim will happen.  They claim it stimulates collagen...I can only hope which is why I will continue to use it. I did use the Obagi Vitamin C oil and liked the feel (a little greasy or oily) and fragrance...but it was just Vitamin C and cost a good deal more too.  So I&#x27;m hoping that with the added benefits of Hyaluronic acid and vitamin E, I&#x27;m getting more bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product about one week I like it can see a slight difference, it does have a smell however I can live with that. If you have wrinkles and fine lines it appears to be helping.</li>
    <li> Like this serum,  but not sure if it was the one I bought before.  Don&#x27;t like the word vegan.  Would rather have natural or organic.  Like I said, I don&#x27;t think this is the brand I bought before.</li>
    <li> I use a derma roller before I use this....its amazing how my face feels minutes after I do and how in one months time my skin looks so much more healthier.</li>
    <li> This is the first Vitamin C serum that I used that has an almost watery consistency.  Goes on smoothly and you can tell when it&#x27;s dry, not like the creamy versions.  Does not add any oil to my skin, which is nice.  I also have been using it on my hands once a day and I can see an improvement.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this pretty much every day for about a month. I am pleasantly surprised as usually when I like a product it&#x27;s benefits tend to diminish or disappear after a week. I would say that my skin is much softer and feels &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; if that makes sense. It does not seem like I need to wear as much makeup to cover up my uneven skin tone and I think my skin looks kind of &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; and dare I say younger?? Perhaps the best testament to this product is that my teenage daughter actually gave me an unsolicited compliment on my skin and told me that my pores look smaller. I have easily spent 10x this on creams that have not done anything for my skin so this is a real bargain and I would have to say seems highly effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several weeks now, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.  It is extremely easy to use, only a small amount is needed, and I already see nice results.  I will definitely continue to use this Vitamin C Serum, and highly recommend this particular seller!</li>
    <li> First I want to say thank you for the initial email giving me instructions&lt;br /&gt;on how to use the product to get the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I am extremely happy with your product and will continue to use&lt;br /&gt;it.  I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin on my face feels.  It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Also a bonus for me is that I have extremely sensitive skin, so everything&lt;br /&gt;makes me breakout or I get hives, BUT your product did not do that to my&lt;br /&gt;face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for having a product that so far seems to work for me!</li>
    <li> I have used Amara Organics&#x27; Vitamin C Serum and Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about six months and I am surprised -- and very, very pleased -- to say that I really notice a difference. I started using both serums when I began a routine of &amp;#34;derma-rolling.&amp;#34; The serums are non-sticky and non-oily; they don&#x27;t make me break out. That&#x27;s such a relief! Most products do. I don&#x27;t remember why I chose the Amara products in the first place. I was surfing Amazon for serums, and the price seemed right. I now apply the Vitamin C Serum first (immediately after my morning shower). The Hyaluronic Acid Serum goes on once the Vitamin C Serum sinks in, which is almost immediately. My skin looks smoother and tighter. I am a skeptic, so I almost didn&#x27;t believe it until a friend of mine asked me WHAT I&#x27;m doing because (according to her) I keep looking younger and younger. That&#x27;s a really nice compliment, and it&#x27;s one that I cannot dispute (even though I like being modest). I don&#x27;t have another explanation. The Amara products, I think, have made the difference. I really, really, really recommend them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and there is a noticeable improvement in&lt;br /&gt;my skin. I&#x27;ve received several positive unsolicited comments on the difference.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I can&#x27;t go without it now. I hate when I forget to order it ahead of time. I can tell the difference in two days my face does not look the same or feel the same.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum.</li>
    <li> I have tried other vitamin C serums that were much more expensive and I like this one better. I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, it might be the vitamin E and hyaluronic acid, but I&#x27;m seeing better results. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody looking for a good vitamin C serum at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best serums I have tried! Sinks in so quickly and my skin feels amazing afterwards. I have already noticed some of my skin texture improving!</li>
    <li> This serum serves as an antioxidant, collagen-builder and moisture lock. Even better, moisturizer/sunscreen and foundation glide on and stay put really well with this serum. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Since using this Vitamin C serum, I can see a definite improvement in my skin. I have been using it for about a month, but I do see that my skin tone is more even.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. It worked really well.  I also liked the fact that the company themselves contacted me personally to see how the product was working . I like it..but, I have since ordering this have started to make my own vitamin c serum ..so for now that is what I am using. I will buy this product again if I need to.</li>
    <li> I am delighted with the serum.  I&#x27;ve used Vit-C in the past and am glad I found Amara.  The serum is wonderful and your emailed instructions were so appreciated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1-2 months now and my skin has cleared up a lot. I&#x27;d say I started seeing the effects about a week in. It&#x27;s making my skin clear and smooth and toned :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 2 or 3 weeks now and am just amazed at the difference in my skin already!  I have lived in Florida for more than 30 years and have a lot of sun damage to my skin.  This product makes my skin sing!  I use it on my face and my forearms as well because of the sun damage.  While it will take some time to really see the improvement, the feel of my skin is so much better now.  Cannot imagine going without this product ever!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product but it broke me out furiously after about a week of use. I believe it may be the vitamin E product which I read is very heavy and can cause the breakouts. I definitely do not recommend using this product if you are acne-prone. Unfortunately I will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend trying this serum!  I&#x27;ve tried several vitamin C serums, and this one is the best overall.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily, like some of the others.  It absorbs immediately.  Moisturizer goes on without a problem after applying serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now, and my skin is brighter, smoother and just healthier!  I use it on my neck and décolleté as well.  try it out, you will be very pleased!</li>
    <li> I am loving my Vitamin C Serum and I use it every morning. I am soon to&lt;br /&gt;turn 45 and my skin is oily (but not as bad as it used to be). I have had no adverse skin&lt;br /&gt;reactions to this product and I can see definite improvements such as my skin seems&lt;br /&gt;smoother and skin tone is much more even. I will continue to use this product and will&lt;br /&gt;purchase again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and have noticed an improvement in my skin and texture.</li>
    <li> This product is very good for mature skin showing a lack luster complexion. I used it and within a week saw results that were pleasing. I would buy this product again and definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I bought Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum based on the reviews that I read and I am so glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks so far and I believe I can already see a difference on the overall tone of my skin and starting to see my wrinkles diminish. I&#x27;ve been a sun worshiper for years and now I&#x27;m paying the price for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was younger, I used a vitamin C product on my face and really loved it but then they stopped making it. When I read about this vitamin serum, I wanted to give it a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Retina product in the morning and just a few drops of Amara Organics Vitamin C serum at night along with a product called bel essence to moisturize my skin. And in just a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s nice is that it only takes a few drops, so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks and love how soft and smooth it makes my skin.  It goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  I use it in the morning on my face and neck and like how lightweight it is.  After placing the order, I received an email with instructions on how to use the product and really appreciated that the company co-founder took the time to send me this info.  I will definitely buy this product again once this bottle is gone.</li>
    <li> This is less expensive than other Vitamin C products.  I use it daily under my regular face cream and it really makes a difference!!!</li>
    <li> I have searched and price comparable serums, many twice the price (or more)! This serum applies easily, leaving my skin smooth and hydrated. Some &#x27;C&#x27;s I have tried are drying but with the hyaluronic acid there was no drying!</li>
    <li> The main reason I chose this product was the great price.  I have been using a very pricey vitaman c serum that was 3 times as much and did not have the vitaman E.  I like the way this goes on my face and is absorbed quickly.  It is not sticky or oily and does not have any smell to it which my other serum had one so bad I could hardly wait to wash my face.  I am 58 and my skin looks pretty darn good!</li>
    <li> Best thing for your face! I look younger and my skin feels amazing!!</li>
    <li> I use a few drops of the serum to cover my face and neck before putting on moisturizer. A little bit goes a long way. I have sensitive skin and it isn&#x27;t irritating at all. It&#x27;s very lightweight going on and absorbs into the skin quickly. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is looking healthier and brighter since I&#x27;ve been using the serum. I breakout easily and it hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out, if anything it seems to help because when I start to get blemishes they seem to go away faster.</li>
    <li> absorbs quickly and goes on well under moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product! I love it ! Just perfect for me and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
    <li> use regularly and I can see a difference</li>
    <li> it was broke and could not use. Threw in trash.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> this did nothing for me but the company refunded me as they promised.  I give 5 starts because you can really try it risk-free.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so it may work for you.  What do you have to lose?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum daily for awhile and I really like it! The bottle lasts for several months and people comment that my skin looks clear and glowing!</li>
    <li> Happy with the product. No smell to the product which is fine by me!</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Loved that I received emails on usage. Will definately order again from this seller. I use this every night followed by moisturizer. It&#x27;s great to use after using derma roller as well. I see drastic improvement in my skin . I fight hormonal acne and wrinkles happy to day my face is clear right now.</li>
    <li> No visual difference.</li>
    <li> My daughter says this really works and highly recommended it for her three sisters!  Arora Orgnaics must have found the &amp;#34;fountain of youth&amp;#34; and bottled some of it.  I,  too, like this product very much.  The price is great,  also.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I wanted something to help protect and maintain my skin, without any irritation (I have very sensitive skin). This does just that.  I thought it would go on a little oilier, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It goes right on and soaks in immediately.  I still use my other skin products in conjunction with this one and it all blends just fine as long as the instructions are followed. My skin also seems a little softer, with a smoother complexion : ).</li>
    <li> watery for sure - Uanble to notice any effects from its use</li>
    <li> Hi Jennifer, I love the product and use it daily on my face neck and hands. My skin looks great and is so soft. I use a derma roller every other day and when I apply your vitamin C serum it calms my skin down and penetrates my derma layer. I have even gotten my husband to use it. His hands were so dry and cracked that he begged me to help him. He had no interest in any of the creams or lotions that I tried to convince him to use. He uses the serum with some rose oil and argan and now even the cracks on his thumbs are healing. Thank you for making a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Patty</li>
    <li> This serum is gentle and leaves my skin feeling so healthy and smooth. I can put sunblock on over it after a short time. Lovely!  Tish</li>
    <li> still not sure if this is working or not. its my second bottle. the seller advised me it takes 6 months to see any benefits, so I continue to use and hope that is correct. It smells good, goes on easy and you need a very teeny tiny, less then pea size drop.</li>
    <li> I have been using about twice a week and after about a month of use i am finally starting to see an added smoothness to my skin. Also I am noticing a more even skin tone...I am not a novice to skincare and regularly take very good care of my skin, so seeing results is sometimes vague. I have been applying to a clean face, allowing to dry, and following up with a simply moisturizer and my skin seems to improve. Hoping to see even more the longer I use!</li>
    <li> This vitamin c serum works good! My skin loves it and what I love even more is when I wax my eyebrows and apply this serum after all the irritation disappears! Only problem is that it contains carregeenen in it so I will probably look for a new formula as a vitamin c serum:however they have a really good vitamin c face wash.</li>
    <li> I never bought this ....so don&#x27;t know if its good or not..</li>
    <li> I love this serum!  Great ingredients, great price and I&#x27;ve noticed improvements in face contours as well as reduced wrinkles on my neck and decolletage area.  I&#x27;m even using it on my arms and age spots are fading!</li>
    <li> I love vitamin C serums for the face and this brand is one of my new favorites. It smells great. It&#x27;s thinner then a serum, but it still goes on nice and easily, absorbing quickly. I can feel my skin tightening as it dries. Lines appear finer and pores appear smaller. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff worth every penny. I suffer from rosacea occasionally and I had a red scaly patch on my cheek that several dermatologists couldn&#x27;t get rid of. This serum did for me. I&#x27;m very happy with the price and performance I would give it ten stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I noticed results in less than two weeks - lightening of sunspots, skin has more of that glow associated with youth.  But what tickles me most - I had resorted to using wart remover on a hard bump, like a cross between a skin tag an a wart on my forehead.  The wart remover was irritating the spot and making it bleed.  This stuff first started soothing and softening the bump, to my relief.  And I couldn&#x27;t believe it at first, but now I&#x27;m sure - the bump is going away!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying a Vitamin C serum from another company at almost five times the price of this one, but after trying this nifty little serum I won&#x27;t be going back to the old, crazy expensive one.  This is a very nice, mild serum with a pleasant citrusy scent.  Because of the affordable price point, I&#x27;ve been also using it on the back of my hands where I had just started to notice some faint spots.  After a couple of weeks of use, they have completely faded.  Make sure it completely dries though, before applying any other products or make-up or you&#x27;ll get some icky flaking.</li>
    <li> Truly an amazing product. I noticed the difference in my skin&#x27;s overall appearance the very first time I used it. And for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Excellent source of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it once and was very happy of the result on my face. I bought a second bottle and will continue using it according to the instruction.</li>
    <li> I have been consecutively using this product since last summer. I am really pleased to see that my freckles and sunburns are getting lighter. I am using the second bottle of VC right now, and have recommended it to my friend. She also bought it, and gave me positive feedback. Thank you for making this product! The value is great for its price.</li>
    <li> Love it can tell a difference after just the first use!</li>
    <li> I am 61 yrs. old and went into panic mode after noticing (suddenly) that my skin was looking and feeling awful.  I started a 3 step approach; I got a prescription for Retin-A, I bought a Clarisonic face washing tool, and third was the Vitamin C.  The improvement is drastic, I&#x27;m thrilled with the improvements in such short time.  I don&#x27;t know how much credit goes specifically to the Vitamin C Serum, but I do like the product and intend to keep using it.  I&#x27;m not going to mess with this \\&quot;magic trifecta\\&quot; that is working so well for me.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try a bottle of this product for free.  It really is wonderful stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and it leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.  My skin looks and is firmer and feels healthier since using the serum.  It&#x27;s light and absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy or oily residue behind.  Works well when coupled with a light moisturizer if your skin tends to be on the drier side like mine.  Although most users probably won&#x27;t even need that, as the serum adds softness by itself.</li>
    <li> This serum made me break our pretty bad. I stopped using it</li>
    <li> I started using the product as soon as I got it. Love the way it makes my skin feel, does not leave greasy residue. Im looking forward to seeing more results!</li>
    <li> I am using this product from past 2 months and can hardly see any difference in my skin. Will continue using it for next 2 more months till the time my first bottle is over after that I am not buying this product anymore.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few days and already see a difference. Loving the product!!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying a serum like this, but I really like it and would recommend it to anyone!  The seller emailed me and gave be directions which I though was very thoughtful and helpful.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen before with products sold on amazon.  I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks so far.  I apply is under my regular moisturizer before going to bed.  My skin is noticeably smoother and softer and some of my lines have softened on my face.  I&#x27;m excited to see what a month or two of using this will bring.  Try it!  It&#x27;s reasonably priced....can&#x27;t really go wrong.</li>
    <li> Retinal Serum has been excellent product as much as I will buy another one soon. My husband is applying the serum and he is impressed for the result. His acne is getting better and his face looks smooth.  I would like to use this product often in order to get better result. Hope my pores become smaller but for now I like the texture of my face. We never experience side effect for using this product every day however I am using retinol every other day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks.  I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or shiny. It has a soothing effect that leaves my face feeling soft and fresh. I like this product and will continue to use it until I finish the first bottle. Once I notice result, I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This product just makes my skin so smooth and fresh. I can feel the tighten process happening after applying it on my face. Will definitely come back for it!</li>
    <li> I did an extensive amount of research on Vitamin C serums before purchasing one. I am so glad that I did my homework and that I chose this product from Amara Organics. I noticed an improvement in my melasma and an overall brightening of my skin in about ten days time. I have found this product to be effective yet gentle, with no resulting reactions or breakouts occurring. I plan to repurchase.</li>
    <li> The packaging was very good with bubblewrap. I really like this product. I like how it stays on my fingers for application and is not too runny. I like how it feels on my face too. I don&#x27;t know if it is helping yet as I only starting using 3 weeks ago.. I am confident that I will keep purchasing this product. The  application instructions were very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I rated it 4 star since I have not had enough time to notice the antiaging effects.</li>
    <li> This product felt good on my face, and even appears to have hydrated it. I really wanted to love this Vitamin C serum like all the rest of the reviews. However, I broke out from it, but still waited a couple days to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;Well, the second try, my face broke again when I put the product in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since so many people loved it, I am guessing my skin doesn&#x27;t like one of the ingredients. Before trying this product, I used Obagi Vitamin C, but it is a lot more money and doesn&#x27;t have all the great ingredients this one has.&lt;br /&gt;I did contact customer service and they responded right away, and that is critical for any product.&lt;br /&gt;I would say, for this price, it is worth a shot. I am only out $20, but had it worked for me, I would have saved a lot per month. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/23/14:&lt;br /&gt;Rather then return the product, since my issue was probably just my skin, I gave the rest to a friend. They just reported back to me that this is working very good for them! I am so happy and I wanted to raise my review by a star. :)</li>
    <li> Excellent job of lightening dark spots.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic! Use with eye gel and moisture cream, all from Amara. See results immediately that just keep getting better.</li>
    <li> The delivery was quick! The serum was good for the first two weeks and i saw a slight change in my skin! Its so moisturizing and sooth and is absorbed by the skin quickly. After the first two weeks, it became a yellowish color. HOWEVER, amara organics suggested sending me a new bottle free of charge! ALSO, when i bought the item, they even sent me an instruction on how to use the serum and everything! It came nicely packaged and protected. Also, if you send them an email, they respond so quick. (Less than 24 hours) i will deffinitely purchase this item again because of the excellent customer service. Even though there was a slight yellowish color after the 2 weeks for my bottle, it seemed to have just been a rare situation and they happily wanted to send me a new one! Im so glad i decided on this serum!</li>
    <li> This is really great stuff! After just a couple of weeks, I can already see a softening of fine lines and my skin looks brighter, somehow. I am very pleased with the results thus far. I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This serum feelings so silky going on and you can almost feel it as it helps to diminish the marionette lines as well as tone your face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and can already see the difference!  The fine lines around my eyes have greatly faded and it leaves my face smooth and tone. I bought it to replace the Vivite antioxidant serum as it contains parabens and I&#x27;m trying to go the more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; route.  I know that Vitamin C serum treats acne but be careful if you have rosacea as Vitamin C is known to cause flare ups for that.&lt;br /&gt;  All in all, I am very happy with this product and will continue you to use it!</li>
    <li> It seemed to be working on the lightening of my skin, but it broke me out.  I also did not care for the color of the serum.  The bottle did not arrive sealed.  It had a cap on and that was all.  That made me a bit uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I have faithfully applied Amara Vitamin C serum every morning for the past three weeks and I LOVE IT. It&#x27;s delivers the results it implies.  My pores look smaller, my skin feels taunt but not tight and the overall look of my skin is bright and clear.  Another bonus is the price.  I have purchased other Vitamin C serums and paid three times more.  I will purchase this item again in the future.</li>
    <li> I am a forty-something, African-American female who was looking for a product to help with evening skin tone and texture. I have just begun developing a regimen, but am skeptical about products because I have very sensitive skin. I purchased this product because of the ingredients, rating and reviews. After using the products for a few days, my skin felt smoother and looked different. The best testimony is that I didn&#x27;t have a reaction. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few months. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product caused me to breakout.  I am not sure that I am willing to go through a breakout phase and have stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Well, I have a ranch here in Texas and I am in the blazing sun, or freezing cold all the time, and for years.&lt;br /&gt;As you might guess my face is weathered, crows feet, lines, you name it lol.&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering what I could do to try and make all there lines and all a bit better. So looking at Amazon and checking out all kinds of skin stuff, I came across this product. I looked at them all, and choose this one, it just seemed like a good one, plus it is at 20% where most of the others are 5, &amp; 10%.&lt;br /&gt;Well long story shorter, I have been using it for about 12 days and my gosh I can tell a big difference! Hey the lines and dark spots aren&#x27;t gone, would not even want that, but they are about 25 to 30% better (less). If your in the market just go for it, I&#x27;ll bet you will be glad you did.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Tommie</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th week of using this serum and only now I&#x27;m noticing visible improvements. Yes, it takes time to see the results, so I would recommend not giving up right away. When it starts working, it really does the job. I&#x27;m in my 30s and those little wrinkles around my eyes were quite visible and annoying, but now I&#x27;m starting to see them disappear. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not going to help you with big age folds, but when it comes to wrinkles, it&#x27;s worth trying this product. It will also make your skin tighter overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2 weeks and I love it. My faces looks so much brighter than before. I combine it with the ambi moisturizer and voila my skin is unbelievably beautiful!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product last year and was quite impressed with how my face appeared smooth and glowy. You only need a few drops to dab on your face and neck and wait for it to dry before you put on your moisturizers etc.  I have several large sun (age) spots on my face and this seems to be minimizing the effect of spots getting bigger and darker. When I put on my mineral powder after applying this + lotion, the spots are almost invisible to the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. It makes my skin very soft, smooth, and definitely younger looking. I also should mention that I have a sensitive skin and this seems to have some calming effect. One bottle will last a long time.  I think I ordered my replacement after almost 8 months. Totally worth it and company response to inquiries and resolution is excellent.</li>
    <li> My skin has improved a lot  in only a few days of using Amara Organics vitamin C serum. I noticed improvement on lines between my eyes and forehead already. My skin feels very soft after putting this serum on and have had no breakouts or any kind of reactions to this serum. I have very sensitive skin and usually buy unscented hypoallergenic products in everything I use. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more improvement as I continue using this product as other reviewers have been raving about. That&#x27;s why I chose their product over others. The great reviews and their price compared to others was really good. After buying this product I received a letter from Jennifer, Co-Founder, Amara Organics with instructions on proper use of their product and to contact with any questions or problems which I thought was great customer service. I have talked with her through email and she responds very quickly.  : )</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and my skin has become so supple and soft!  And I think it is also helping with the break-outs- I am getting FAR fewer blackheads and pimples.  My husband has noticed a difference too- says I look 10 years younger!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff. It is not oily just penetrates into your skin. Just ordered 2 more bottles</li>
    <li> I am 53 year old male. Besides a rough and stressful life I roofed homes for many years and never thought of using sun screen. Now I am regretting it seriously. Just out of the blue I woke one morning not long ago, looked at myself in the mirror and inwardly cringed. Deep wrinkles, frown lines, spotting and discoloration stared back.&lt;br /&gt;I had always tried to take care of my body and even now many women comment on how my body is trim and muscular, but if I can&#x27;t stand to look at myself in a mirror nothing like what they say matters to me.&lt;br /&gt;To correct the deep chin wrinkles I went for a $600 injection and some botox. The botox took a week to kick in and lasted about 2 more weeks and I was back to full muscle control. The injectable is almost too after only about 6 weeks. Figure will last many 2 months more.&lt;br /&gt;Also I have tried a few products with retinal but felt that my face was becoming swollen around the wrinkles making me look even worst. Maybe I needed to keep on it but I did notice that using this Vit C serum (only one I have so far tried-like the price) in the morning my face was becoming tighter.&lt;br /&gt;I started rolling a little here and there and applying the serum and I cannot believe the difference in such a short time.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly see my deep wrinkles smoothing out and head lines and even under and on side of my eyes are lessening. Chin wrinkles are quite deep, but even those are looking better.&lt;br /&gt;I do exercise and eat healthy so I know this plays along with the serum. The serum is making a difference for sure. I read reviews that there are others just as good but for the price as mentioned above i will stick to this one for now.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it in morning after shower and in evening after scrubbing face with raw honey and salt.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Easy to use and makes my skin feel wonderful</li>
    <li> Love the product. I have been using the serum for a couple of weeks and I haven noticed a difference in my complexion and the tone of my skin. The product is so easy to use and so effective.</li>
    <li> vitamin C for your skin is a great idea. It feels tighter already on my face, not to mention smoother. The vitamin E makes it much softer. (I&#x27;m 60)</li>
    <li> Not enough in the bottle to see results.</li>
    <li> Nice product, would recommend. I&#x27;ve already repurchased this and my boyfriend started using it as well.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT SAW RESULTS VERY QUICKLY, WILL PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see any changes, this is my second bottle, I will NOT order more, I use other stuff like andalou, What I do find that makes a difference in my skin is pure raw coconut oil unfiltered, cold pressed. Not expensive and works great on ALL of your body parts, not just the face...Hair, body, face, vaginal area as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing a video on YouTube and it&#x27;s purpose for diminishing the appearance of stretch marks and acne combined with a derma roller. I have been using it and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. It&#x27;s good for fine line and wrinkles too, great product will be using it again!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.... At 445 I have tried many products over the years, and I am grateful to have one that not only works but one that is not full of chemicals and parabens. I have now been using Amara Organics for nearly three years and I look the same...even better than I did before using it. My mom and aunt have noticed and have been purchasing for over a year now as well. What a wonderful product... Thank you!</li>
    <li> My skin looks great!  I have been using the product for about 3 weeks. My skin is brighter, the tone is more even, it just looks smoother overall. I plan to continue using a vitamin c serum, particularly this product; I love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s organic and is relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I have used other vitamin c products - sometimes arrive rather granulated which makes me think they are old. This was smooth - no granules- and a rich consistency that was easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It cleared up some persistent blemishes. It has evened out my skin and cleared up patches of dry skin. I&#x27;ve seen visible results in three weeks. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I received my vitamin C about two weeks ago and since then I have been using it twice a day. I am African and have suffered from acne for over 10 years. I am in my mid twenties and it&#x27;s starting to subside, so I decided to find something to get rid of the scarring and to rejuvenate my skin. I have seen some change, but I understand with the issues I have had with my skin it will take time for the final results I am seeking. I love the consistency of them serum. I have had it for bout two weeks and it has not oxidized, which is great.  I will continue to use it and will be back to update my review once this bottle is done. I anticipate I will be re-purchasing :)</li>
    <li> I just got this yesterday.  Got an email from the seller telling me how to use it for optimal results. I thought that was pretty awesome. I&#x27;ll try to update after I&#x27;ve used this for a month or so.</li>
    <li> I have mature sensitive skin that is prone to redness and this is the first product I have found that instantly soothes, calms and brightens. It&#x27;s also hydrating and I find I sometimes don&#x27;t need a moisturizer on top this serum in the summer. I try to use all natural products if at all possible and I love that Amara products are organic. I am halfway through my second bottle and I am sure I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I am see some of my dark spots lighten and the skin tone is becoming more even. I will keep using this  brand. I have only ordered one bottle so far.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum just as a try out and I was very impressed with it after using it just a couple times.  I started seeing a difference in my complexion right away. I&#x27;ve almost completed the first bottle and I ordered a second so I would have it when I finish the first. I use my moisturizer with sunscreen over the serum after it dries into my skin.  I am continuing to see good results and am looking forward to even more positive results in months to come.  I am a senior and have used a lot of skin treatments over the years and I have to say I wasted a lot of money on skincare that was not needed.  This serum is so much better in every way with results, being healthier and cost effective.  I would recommend it 100%.  Eat healthy, drink a lot of water and take care of that face with Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Amara Organics Vitamin C serum for about a month.  My face feels smooth after applying and stays that way all day.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE, ORGANIC, VIT C W/ HYALURONIC ACID &#x3D; WONDERFUL!  LIGHT, NOT GREASY, ABSORBS EXCELLENTLY, BRIGHTENS COMPLEXION.  TRY IT!</li>
    <li> Been using this now for over two weeks and my complexion seems a lot better already! I am definitely going to keep using it and see the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you try it!!!!!</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks my skin seem feel softer but no hydration so I still need to a cream to moisturize my skin</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Vitamin C serum and your accompanying&lt;br /&gt;instructions. (Great customer service is hard to come by.) I noticed an&lt;br /&gt;improvement in my skin almost immediately and am getting compliments on&lt;br /&gt;how young my skin looks. I also went to my dermatologist to get a&lt;br /&gt;prescription of Retin-A and will will start using that at night and&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C serum in the morning. I wouldn&#x27;t have known about this regimen&lt;br /&gt;if it weren&#x27;t for the comments left by your customers. If my skin can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;tolerate the Retin-A, I will be happy just to continue the serum. You&lt;br /&gt;have a customer for life!</li>
    <li> Since I started using the Amara Organics serum I&#x27;ve noticed two things: one, the redness I had on my nose and cheeks has fades, and two, the spotting along my hairline have started to fade too. No such luck with the bags under my eyes, but nothing ever seems to help them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need two or three drops - the serum spread easily and you don&#x27;t want to apply too heavily.  Which means this bottle is going to last forever! And so will my skin.</li>
    <li> THIS DIS NOT WORK FOR SO i SWITCH TO DIFFERENT COMPANY  SELLING COMPARABLE PRODUCT A LIKE THE NEW BRAND THAT I M USING NOW</li>
    <li> This product really does make a difference on how my skin looks.  I have only used it for about 5 days and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic!  It helped lighten my dark spots tremendously and my skin looks brighter and clearer and looks wonderful. This serum is amazing!</li>
    <li> I really love this serum!  This is my second bottle and I can see a noticeable improvement in the texture and tone of my skin.  I use 5-6 drops every morning and evening, the bottle lasts for quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C Serum since I received the package in the mail. It lighten my skin and melasma on my both cheeks area.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It makes my skin look bright and fresh. I didn&#x27;t get drastic changes but I did see wrinkles and scars I have on my cheeks look much better. I will continue to buy this serum and wear it every morning.</li>
    <li> Not all I expected but helpful</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t see mayor results yet but my big pores had shrink a little big.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing! I have used an expensive Vit C product, but I truly believe that this is way better. Dries quickly, a little goes a long way, and my skin feels more firm.</li>
    <li> This product absorbs quickly and feels nice on my skin.</li>
    <li> I received the serum in early April, so I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of weeks and so far I love it! I&#x27;m 42 and though I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, I felt my face could be smoother looking (some scars on my cheeks from teenage acne) and I felt my skin was looking drab and dull. In just the few short weeks I can see my skin starting to look smoother and a little brighter already! Jennifer (the co-founder) sends an email out to you after you purchase the product, giving suggestions on use and when you could start seeing results (which is fantastic customer service). I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing continued progress as I use this more and as the months go on. For usage, I put three drops into my palm and I&#x27;m able to spread it on my face and neck just fine. I use it once a day in the morning and I let it soak in for about 10 minutes or so before I apply any make-up. Great product and I love that I know everything that&#x27;s in it. It&#x27;s good for my face and skin! Right now this is the only product that Amara makes, but I can tell you that they have a loyal customer in me and I look forward to seeing any future products!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far, and it seems to give my face more elasticity.  I am over 45 and am suffering from that loss of youthful elasticity and a little bit of sagging around my jawline.  Which I see, but others say is not there lol  I think the Vit C has given me more GLOW and a &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; look to my skin.</li>
    <li> It seemed to make my face nice and moisturized and firm after one month of I used the product! Great results for a very reasonable price and best customer care!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! AMAZING RESULTS....GREAT PRICE....OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I initially bought it because I noticed a good friend&#x27;s skin was looking particularly amazing.  She told me she&#x27;d been using the Vitamin C serum for about a month.  Being in my late forties, I, like my friend, had been noticing some brown spots from sun damage becoming more prominent.  She said she really noticed a difference after using the serum, especially with the spots on the back of her hands!  AND it was all organic and natural.  So, I immediately bought myself a bottle.  Within 7-10 days, I noticed my skin was much brighter and had a more even tone.  And those results continued with each day I used the serum! Especially on the back of my hands!  Also, I&#x27;d been having pretty regular breakouts on my chin for the last 8 months, due to some hormonal imbalance.  That has completely stopped since I&#x27;ve been using the serum!  I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on my skin!  AND I received a personal follow-up email from Jennifer, the company&#x27;s co-founder, wondering how I was liking the product and asking if I had any questions.  I was so impressed with this!  Such a rarity!  I 100% RECOMMEND AMARA ORGANICS VITAMINC C SERUM!  Cant wait to try their other products!  Thanks, Jennifer!</li>
    <li> Best Serum (20%) on the market. Natural and organic. I am on my third bottle and use&lt;br /&gt;it every day.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is wonderful, my skin looks brighter and even-toned and it diminished redness. I love the product, I just apply moisturizer after the serum is absorbed and my skin never looked better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the personal customer service from this company.  I really like this serum.  A little bit goes a long way, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my face, it feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my other beauty products.</li>
    <li> This is a highly effective face serum.  I have used C and E serums for years and they brighten the skin while helping to provide extra sun protection (sunscreen is still a must!) for those of us who use retin-A or retinal products.  The addition of hyaluronic acid to this serum is pure genius as it makes the skin feel especially silky.  One HUGE additional plus to this product from Amara is that the product doesn&#x27;t oxidize and darken quickly.  Products three times the price begin to darken in a month and become unusable long before the bottle is empty.  According to Customer Service, the Amara people will replace their product if it darkens.  And speaking of customer service, I was contacted personally by them after making making my purchase.  They checked to be certain that the shipment arrived safely and gave helpful instructions about the use of their product.  Most unusual these days!  I look forward to seeing what their new products will be!</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum based on other great reviews (thank you to those who write reviews!) so now I need to write my own. I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a month now but even when I first started, I noticed that when I put it on in the morning under my moisturizer it really made my skin look luminous, so smooth and my pores looked smaller by the end of the first week!! I got compliments from people, other women asking me what I used😁 and my makeup looked great all day! So...I highly recommend this product, I&#x27;m 39 years old and have been an avid sun worshipper but it&#x27;s NEVER too late to start taking better care of your skin! Thank you Amara Organics fir making such a great product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical this serum, that was affordably priced, would live up to my expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised it did and then some.  This serum feels good on the skin and penetrates great without a greasy feel.  I have sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t react well to some products, but this serum has just the right amount of blended ingredients.  I love that it combines Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Hyaluronc Acid to make this a triple winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, when I purchased the product, I received an email with instructions on how to best use the product which was a pleasant surprise. I had contacted the owner of Amara Organics with several questions I had and guess what, she answered all of them quickly.  This is a company that cares about the people who purchase their products.  And this product is one I can definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I started using Amara Organics Vitamin C Serum just recently.  The other day I ran into a friend who asked me if I had just had a facial because my skin looked so good!  What a compliment to both me and this product.  And, the customer service and follow-up from Amara is OUTSTANDING.  I will definitely order more!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this serum for a month  alternated with retinol and under other creams.  I&#x27;ve noticed a little improvement in my skin texture and tone but it&#x27;s hard to tell which one is doing what.    What I like about this serum:  Doesn burn or itch unlike other Vitamin C serums I have tried.  Lightweight, absorbs quickly and leaves my skin matte.  Provides an instant lifting effect.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    Update    After trying Mad hippie&#x27;s vitamin C I take one star off of this product and recommend it as an ok/decent serum. The consistency of Mad hippie&#x27;s is a lot richer, I can even wear it by itself and feel my skin hydrated and comfortable unlike Amara&#x27;s which I needed to wear a mousturizer on top. I also am seeing better results on skin tone, texture and even dark circles appearance with Mad hippie&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Skin feels smoother but no change in wrinkles.I am going to give it a good try before giving up on it.</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful. It makes your face amazingly soft and smooth. It is not oily and dries quickly without a heavy cream feel. Very light and airy while really getting the job done.</li>
    <li> I love the product, it hydrates my skin wonderfully, is easy to apply and the owner follows up to make sure all is well. Great prices too for those looking for organic products too. Would not hesitate to recommend.</li>
    <li> i have been using it for a while  but cannot see any difference in my skin. will continue untill i finish and see. but it is easy to apply and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Great will order again. Very fast service. Thanks</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference with even the first application. Definitely worth a shot..best if used with good diet and exercise regimen.</li>
    <li> dont knoe yet too soon</li>
    <li> Can actually feel it working.  I have very oily complexion, and it absorbs the oil and dries quickly.  And then, my moisturizer glides on and falls into all the right places😳😊😀😃</li>
    <li> really works to diminish fine wrinkles</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this serum. It sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance. I use it at night with just a basic moisturizer and I wake up to skin that is refreshed.</li>
    <li> It was a waste of money and felt sticky on my skin. Fashion Fair has a fabulous vitamin serum</li>
    <li> This serum is really great and the company service is excellent. I believe I can already see brighter, smoother skin. I have sensitive skin and the serum has been non-irritating. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received the serum about a week ago or so.  It feels so smooth going on my skin.  I do have a few concerns.  I would love it if this had an SPF.  I wind up using another product on top of this just for the SPF.  Also, the directions state &#x27;use a small amount&#x27;.  Well, what exactly is a small amount?  It would be helpful if the dropper that is included had a line letting you know to use that specific amount.  Otherwise, I have high expectations for this and plan to continue using it to see what happens.</li>
    <li> I love it and works great and this will be in my makeup bag forever! Thank you Amara Organics</li>
    <li> This is a life saver for my face. I have oily skin, but have never had an issue with break outs, other than the occasional blemish from using a product that was too oily/creamy by mistake. But at 42, both jaw lines started breaking out and wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what OTC product I tried. My face started clearing up the first week I used this, and by the 2nd week, was totally clear. Although this product is not marketed as blemish control, after Googling Vitamin C serum and hyaluronic acid and seeing the benefits from those, I chose this one based on other positive reviews and what the articles say Vitamin C can do for your skin. The company emailed me after my first order with instructions on how to use it, which I greatly appreciated, as I&#x27;d never used it before. I keep it in a drawer in the bathroom so as not to compromise the integrity of the serum with light and humidity. Mine hasn&#x27;t clouded up at all in the drawer.  A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t squeeze too much out of the dropper at one time. I&#x27;ve already placed my 2nd order and will continue to order as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  This is my second bottle and I would not have repurchased if I didn&#x27;t like it.  Skin looks and feels better</li>
    <li> These people who run this site Amara Organics are super at what they know about organics.  They are friendly and Prompt.&lt;br /&gt;I received my Vit C serum within 3 days or ordering.  They are very much in tune with the consumer.</li>
    <li> Everyone is ranting and raving about the customer service and how they received an email from the company with instructions, etc. I never received an email...hmm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is great so far. It&#x27;s been about a week and I&#x27;ve been applying a very little bit every morning. A little goes a long way with this product. I&#x27;m battling with hyperpigmentation, acne scars and a couple of active breakouts. I haven&#x27;t worn face makeup in about a month (trying to get rid of chemical laden products on my skin) and notice that my complexion has improved significantly since using this serum. I was going to wait since I was using it for at least two weeks to review, but I am already noticing a difference in my skin. The active breakouts have been drying up much more quickly than they normally would have without this product. I know it&#x27;s early, but I think I&#x27;ve found my go to product! The only products I use are this serum in the AM, an all natural oil cleanser at night, and rosehip seed oil (Life Flo) as a moisturizer in the morning and evening. Will likely continue to buy this product if it continues to work as it has thus far.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for wrinkles and age spots. They have improved dramatically in just one month. Much to my surprise, my acne completely disappeared almost overnight. I had been using proactive plus....all I use now is the vitamin c serum and coconut oil. My routine is so low maintenance and my skin hasn&#x27;t been this flawless since I was 14. That was 21 years ago! Love.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It works well under moisturizer to help your skin stay unwrinkled and to help the moisturizer work more efficiently.  Vitamin C is thought to be excellent for aiding in wrinkle prevention and the hyaluronic acid it contains also mositurzes and helps draw more moisture to the are from any other moisturizer that you use.  I recommend this product highly.  I also recommend the use of sunscreen on top of your moisturizer to keep your skin looking young.</li>
    <li> I received my order today and its only half way full and there&#x27;s no seal on it anymore I payed so much and this is what I get</li>
    <li> I think I like this serum. Of course it is going to take some time to show significant results. However, with continued use I do expect the Vitamin C to help. So I will definitely reorder...</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE this serum!!! Perfect to use after the derma roller! Very soothing :-)</li>
    <li> Loving this product my face feels great and I&#x27;m starting to see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and my skin has improved immensely. Not to mention the awesome customer service. I highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
    <li> I have had really deep lines by my eyebrows for years and this has dramatically reduced them! I use it around my eyes as well.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful but I ended up really liking this product..  I wanted to get my usual from Oz beauty (name not entirely correct) but they kept raising their price.  So I thought I would give this one a try  I found it to be as good as the previous brand and less expensive.  My skin reacted well to it.  I think the other brand&#x27;s bottle may have been smaller for a higher price but it too had the Hyaluronic Acid in it as well.  Will keep using this until I stop seeing any improvement in either my skin tone or in the product itself.</li>
    <li> wow...I love this serum.  I train horses, cowboy &amp; outside a lot. I have had cancer places on my hands, spots on the side of my face. So, here again I always look at the star rating before I buy. This one seem rated enough, price was good, so decided to give it a try. OMG...I was totally surprised. This serum is awesome. My skin is smoothing out, my hands have almost cleared up {been nearly 3 weeks now}, and it just feels so soft. I have tried a lot of prod...you know, all the miracle workers, but this does what it sais it will do...it certainly has for me. Went ahead &amp; got my 2nd bottle, don&#x27;t want to run out of this for sure. Even got an email asking if I received this on time &amp; everything was OK...yes it is! thanks for a great product that doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
    <li> First off I have tried oz vitamin c serum and I thought it was good but not after I tried this one. This is really a serum not some water down product. I already bought a second bottle and will keep on buying this same one. Great product</li>
    <li> Seemed to work okay but didn&#x27;t have the same effect as vitamin C alone.  I use this when I am off the Tret. and Clear.</li>
    <li> Having had laser treatments x3 during the past year for brown spots on my face, the MD prescribed a Vitamin C serum and a brightening serum...This product is a mixture of both at a MUCH lower price and has performed very well.  I highly recommend your trying it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum. I have acne prone skin and generally have to use benzoyl peroxide 10% twice a day just to keep my skin from exploding with acne. Since starting using this serum for preventative aging care, I don&#x27;t have to use my benzoyl at all. It&#x27;s been about a week without using it and for me that&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the anti-aging effects, it seems to work great. I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles yet but I do have expression lines on my forehead that I hate and this (in conjunction with a dermaroller and yes to tomatoes moisturizer) has made them nearly disappear. I also have light acne scarring and this both reduced redness and any depth differences. My skin isn&#x27;t perfect yet but acne wise, it&#x27;s 100% clear which for me is RARE and the scars are much much better. I would say so far I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update again in a few months!</li>
    <li> Love it!  My skin is glowing and fine lines are less noticable after a month of use.  I highly recommed this product!</li>
    <li> So far, I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have seen a difference in my skin.  I will always use this product.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this product.  Didn&#x27;t really notice any changes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet. You have to continue to use it for extended periods of time. Like anything else for your skin. Too soon to tell actually!</li>
    <li> I bought Vitamin C serum and very happy with this product.  My skin looks radiant and fresh.</li>
    <li> its affordable!!!  and a lovely serum smooth and silky on the skin and I will purchase more !!!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on freshly washed face alone or put some right in my face lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my skin feels and looks.&lt;br /&gt;oh did I mention they high top quality customer service too!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now used this product for a month, applying once a day at night. I can&#x27;t see or feel any difference in skin firmness or smoothness. In addition, the product cakes when applied and causes skin redness that does not go away quickly or easily. In fact, I believe it may have even caused discoloration around my mouth and on my cheeks manifesting as a mix of darker skin blotches with paler ones (a very funny and symmetrical pattern on both sides of the face). I can&#x27;t blame the discoloration on anything else, as this is the only product I&#x27;ve added recently to my well-established skincare routine. It has also caused my already acne-prone skin to break out on my forehead, cheeks, and chin. I would not buy it again, and would not recommend it to others, while acknowledging that my skin reaction may be very individual. I am going to stop using it now, and see if the discoloration goes away. I may update my review later on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few Vitamin C serums, but never one like this with not only the Vitamin C but also Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin E. This serum felt smooth and really cool on my skin. My skin was radiant and much softer afterwards. I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s so I&#x27;m experiencing a few wrinkles but also dry spots and this serum seems to make it much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other Amara Organic products and have been very satisfied. This is a very high quality Vitamin C serum. I like that it is made in the United States and that they do not use animal testing which is very important to me. I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time and I&#x27;m sure over time, the more I use it, the more improvement I will see. All I know right now is it leaves my skin soft, glowing and actually younger than before. I was asked to test and review this item and give my honest opinion of it. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to improve how their face looks.</li>
    <li> I was given this serum to try for free, with that being said I really love this tuff so far. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a little over two weeks and my skin already feels smoother and looks brighter. I haven&#x27;t really seen any changes in my dark spots but I&#x27;m hoping over time those will start to fade as well.</li>
    <li> I am thirty-one, so why do I need anti-aging serum? I have mini-strokes. I have since I was eighteen. The sweat glands and oil glands in my face are dead. That might seem like a blessing, but, while making me less moist and shiny, my skin stays dry and rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this vitamin C serum twice-per-day on my face and neck. I am very pleased with the serum. I even dabbed a bit on my elbows, where the skin is beginning to wrinkle and sag. The results are as the product page describes - plumper, more youthful skin, with fewer wrinkles. The antioxidants, vitamins, and other ingredients work powerfully in my favor. Now, if only it came in a larger size....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only constructive criticism is the container. I&#x27;m not a fan of the bottle-with-dropper idea. It is too easy to knock over, spill, or otherwise waste. I&#x27;d rather a pump-style product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quality-tested this product for the manufacturer. I have no financial stake in the product or the manufacturer&#x27;s success. I hope my review helped you with your purchasing decision.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying the Vitamin C Serum so far and am using it each evening after I take my shower. I really love how sheer it is and am amazed at how quickly it disappears into my skin leaving no greasy layer behind. It&#x27;s an excellent product and has been easy to incorporate into my nightly routine.</li>
    <li> I AM IN THE SUN EVERYDAY AND HAVE SUNDAMAGED SKIN, AFTER A FEW WEEKS MY SKIN SEEMS A LITTLE SOFTER BUT NO MIRACLE HAS HAPPENED YET BUT I WILL KEEP USING IT HOPING FOR ONE!</li>
    <li> I just bought another Vit C. serum, and I am not as happy with the other brand.&lt;br /&gt;I think Amara Vit C. is less drying on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also use less Amara C than the xyz brand.</li>
    <li> Love it; have been using for several months.</li>
    <li> Have used the product before and have many skin allergies. It worked well on my face and no allergic reactions. My face is definitely softer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! It makes my skin feel so good and I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> The very day I first used Amara Organics Vitamin C serum I was complimented that my skin looked great! It makes my skin feel softer lines and age spots look less noticeable and my skin has a healthy glow as well it looks firmer. I have never seen my skin look this good definitely in need of Vitamin C I am now loyal to this serum it&#x27;s Great!</li>
    <li> Amara Organics Serum  amazing !! I really like it!!  I saw the result from the first day I used it!</li>
    <li> Jury is still out ... haven&#x27;t finished the bottle yet.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this makes my skin look and feel, it&#x27;s not miraculous or anything nut your skin does need vitamin C to stay young and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. My skin care regime is a very gentle organic cleanser. I follow this with an all natural toner, vitamin c serum and argon oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I believe this product has helped with some a some discoloration. I believe it has helped create a more even skin tone. It never caused any breakouts or irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it only in the evening. I live in Florida so with all the humidity I don&#x27;t need excessive moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> Very light and my pores appear smaller.</li>
    <li> This worked well, my face looks and feels smoother.</li>
    <li> I received the Vitamin C drops very quickly! I just finished my previous bottle, so I am happy to have this new one. I opened this bottle now. The quality is consistently awesome. I am grateful for the luxurious feeling I wake up with. Smiles &amp; mahalo!</li>
    <li> excellent product, recommend; helping my senior face skin look brighter and tighter</li>
    <li> I love the consistency. It spreads nicely. Haven&#x27;t been using long enough to notice results but i like the product. A pump bottle might make application easier but the dropper works fine</li>
    <li> Love this vitamin c serum. My skin feels like silk after only 5 days.  I love it.  Best customer service I have ever dealt with.</li>
    <li> Not really sure if there has been any visible results but my face feels more soft. I do think my pores may be shrinking a little. I like this serum.</li>
    <li> Really love the serum.  Love the natural content (aloe, witch hazel, etc.)&lt;br /&gt; and love how it seems to tighten my face!!</li>
    <li> so far (after one week) I do see a difference will use for 30 days as directed to continue use or not</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  It is light weight and disappears as soon as I apply it.  It  has improved the color of my complexion and the smoothness of my skin.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum is all the rage for its anti-aging benefits.  It helps stimulate collagen and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;ve used quite a few different Vitamin C serums and this one from Amara Organics is really good.  It has 20% Vitamin C , hyaluronic acid and vitamin E and it is very gentle on my skin.  It is very soothing and refreshing and wears well under my makeup.  When you put it on it feels like silk...really silky and nice.  It really seemed to help give my skin a dewy glow that even my teenage son commented on.  I really like this product and the way it looks and feels on my skin.  Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! It&#x27;s easy to apply, non sticky and great customer support!! My skin looks radiant and hydrated. Even my aesthetician has noticed a huge difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff really has significantly cleared up the scars and brown spots on my hands after only a week. Worked just like the other people reported it does.</li>
    <li> Honestly I have been using it for a month now and I see know difference.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I have used other vitamin C serumsand This one goes on smooth and feels light. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> i never got the email from the company on how to use it . and for the price i thought it would last longer but it only lasted a week .if i used it longer it may have worked but i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll buy another one since it finished so quickly</li>
    <li> This has changed my skin and changed my fine lines and wrinkles, I now order this month to month and use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I keep doing a double take in the mirror to see if it&#x27;s really me, this works great. It&#x27;s so light, I don&#x27;t even feel it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this 3 times now. I&#x27;m in love! I&#x27;m only 25 but have tanned a lot and have noticed the effects. I was starting to get lines/ wrinkles near my eyes. I did a lot of research and came upon vitamin C serum. I noticed results after 2 weeks. Now after 3.5 months my skin is glowing and people around me are noticing. If you want to take back years of damage on your skin use this!</li>
    <li> So it&#x27;s been almost a month with this product (the second one I have tried) and this one works much better and I have seen quicker results than with the first one I purchased from another manufacturer.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time my face looked this good.</li>
    <li> This product did help improve my skin texture but I am suspicious of it&#x27;s organic claims. I see 20 brands of the same product in identical bottles on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum that can be used under your sunscreen-moisturizer to enhance the sunscreen&#x27;s effectiveness. It only takes a few drops per application, and my skin looks and feels great. I have to say, the customer service is stellar; I received an email detailing how and when to use this serum, and a follow-up email to see how I liked the serum and if I had any questions. I have never experienced this level of customer service and I was quite impressed.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any change or improvements in my face since using it.</li>
    <li> Have seen no improvement to justify its use.....been three months</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second bottle. I&#x27;m very happy with this serum. My face is brighter and it has helped to erase the redness in my skin.  No single product works for everyone, but this is worth a try in my opinion. I also really appreciated the follow up email I received from the owner of Amara Organics after my purchase just to check in on how the product was doing for me.</li>
    <li> I used this product consistently on my face and really helps to tone the discoloration on your face but I&#x27;ve used other products that gave me faster results.</li>
    <li> LOVE it!!!!!  Seeing a difference in just a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Outstanding follow-up to the product.</li>
    <li> Great product and amazing customer service!</li>
    <li> great product, found best result in my skin; such as, acne scars.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it!  The results from using this vitamin C serum are amazing.  I have convinced several of my friends to try using it since they have complimented me on how great my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has made my acne scars fade and I just feel so clean after applying it to my face. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product thus far. I purchased back in November, 2014 and have been using it consistently ever since. I am almost 32 and have not been so kind to my skin; tanning beds and I work outside for an average of 10-12 hours a day. I have noticed that my sun spots are fading, and this serum has prevented any new acne scars or other blemishes from hanging around. The key here is patience. I&#x27;ve spent the majority of my life damaging my skin; it would be very ignorant of me to think ANY product is going to erase this damage in a matter of weeks or even months. However, now is a better time than any to start making progress in the right direction!  I also like that this product is organic, fairly priced, and made in the USA! Ms. Jennifer Thompson is very professional and to be honest I was shocked she replied to my emails. At first, I thought her e-mail was a robotic automatic response to my purchase, but when I e-mailed her with a few questions I received a very quick reply. It is very rare to find that type of professionalism in today&#x27;s society and I doubt you would get that kind of service from one of these retail shops!  This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written but felt it was worth my time to support this product line and this company. Please feel free to ask me any questions.</li>
    <li> i just purchased my fourth bottle of the Vitamin C serum.  I really like how it absorbs immediately into the skin and keeps my face looking clear and calm.  An esthetician said my skin looks really good and healthy.  I like that it&#x27;s 20% vitamin C.  I have had a lot of eczema in the past, especially with citrus, so I was a little wary of using vitamin C, but all is well with this product!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of natural products for my skin. I have my whole regiment down to a science. When I first started incorporating vitamin C serums, I tried three different product lines before I discovered Amara Organics.  What I like about this vitamin C serum that I didn&#x27;t like about the other three is this one doesn&#x27;t sting and it&#x27;s not too watery or too thick. It is just right. I started seeing good results with the other two vitamin c products I was using, but I couldn&#x27;t use it consistently because one of them used to burn my skin, one was too thick and almost like a gummy consistency and it would leave a film on my face, and the other one was a combination of both. I hate that I have to always spend a lot of money trying out different products before I find what works for me, but my sensitive, dry skin can&#x27;t tolerate everything that claims to be good or work wonders.  What has helped me is eating healthy, taking vitamins and supplements, drinking water, getting rest, and using all natural topical products. My skin looks awesome. I get compliments all the time. People think I am in my late 20s even though I am almost 40. It&#x27;s a lifestyle and results don&#x27;t happen overnight, but with discipline and consistent use of the right mix of natural products that work for you, you will see results and can potential take off up to 10 years of age. I&#x27;ve been into this lifestyle for a while, so I am happy to have found the right potency of vitamin c serum that works for me.</li>
    <li> This Amazon listing of the product does list all the ingredients in the serum only the top three.  There seem to be another 20 ingredients that you only find out about after you receive the product.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! It goes on very smoothly, dries quickly and acts as a good base. Since I started using it, I find that the old acne scars on my face are beginning to fade and my skin is noticeably brighter and clearer. This has definitely become a necessary part of my skin care routine and I will be buying this serum over and over and over!</li>
    <li> Thank you! This is my second bottle-I love it and don&#x27;t want to do as many peels or microdermabrasion because of your product:) tTeresa Foster</li>
    <li> I do see a difference.</li>
    <li> This serum is great!! it has reduced my wrinkles and my acne.</li>
    <li> delivery was as promised. product exceeds expectations. easy to use and store in the cabnet. love it.</li>
    <li> At first into 2wks I didn&#x27;t notice anything, but after 5 weeks, I could definitely tell that my pores were ALOT smaller and on the PLUS side I didn&#x27;t have any breakouts! My dark spots also faded to almost non apparent... I feel very confident going out without makeup, because my face is smooth with very small blemishes.. I will definitely order again, because I believe this is the Vitamin C  Serum FOR ME!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say the fine lines on my face have disappeared, but it is a nice and light moisturizer. I will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> I like how it leaves my skin feeling. Also, I thought I&#x27;d add that I have very very sensitive skin so there are only a hand full of products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin and this product doesn&#x27;t. Also it&#x27;s not oily at all which I really like. Shipping was standard. The only thing I noticed that I didn&#x27;t like is that the ink from the outside of the bottle smears.</li>
    <li> Consistancy is very thin and watery which is great because it absorbs so fast so you can put moisturizer over right away. I noticed a difference very quickly that my tone was more smooth looking overalll and almost silkier.  Leaves skin very soft. I have been getting compliments which feels so nice as a former acne prone teen with sensitive skin.  I haven&#x27;t had a visible difference in a new product like this in a very long time so look forward to continued use!</li>
    <li> I do like this!!! I&#x27;ve been using it after I use the derma roller... The combination of both has made my skin lighter &amp; clear ( I&#x27;ve also been using dr woods black soap w/acv toner; all great products). No wrinkles here!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin looks more radiant. I noticed the difference just after a week of usage. Haven&#x27;t seen much results on fine lines, but I love the glow in my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for over a month and I absolutely love it.  It has good ingredients(nothing nasty or irritating).  If you look at the ingredients list, this is an exact dupe for the Palmetto Derma Collagen Booster and Restoration Serum that is sold for $48.  I recently got that serum in a FabFitFun box and on a whim I compared the ingredients and they are identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this serum because it is hydrating enough to be used alone if you are wanting something that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.  It&#x27;s thin and layers well with other products, and I did see some fading in my post acne scarring.  I highly recommend this product.  It&#x27;s a steal at this price and it really does make a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for review, but my opinions are 100% honest.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have used it for a couple of months and I have noticed improvement in my skin tone and fine lines. I would highly recommend this brand. I tried a different brand before this one and it may have been working, but I didn&#x27;t see as much improvement until I switched to Amara Organic brand.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for two months and what a difference! I have my &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; back and my wrinkles have decreased tremendously. It is great to hear.. &amp;#34;You Look Amazing&amp;#34;. This product is my new fountain of youth.</li>
    <li> I just finished my second bottle and I love how these make my face feels :) I really like it. It absorbed quickly onto my skin and does not oxidizes or go bad like the fresh vitamin c serums that I have tried before. This serum makes my face look healthy and bright. After I finished the second bottle, I decided to try the &amp;#34;OZ Naturals - THE BEST Vitamin C Serum For Your Face - Organic Vitamin C&amp;#34; because of all the good reviews that everyone was saying about it, it made me really curious so I ordered one. I don&#x27;t see the results that everyone was raving about. For me, the Amara Organics serums get my 5 stars. I am definitely going back to this one on my next purchase. Don&#x27;t ever stop making them!</li>
    <li> I used to have perfect skin - my one great attribute.  After being diagnosed with multiple autoimmune disorders, my skin became dry and very flaky.  I tried everything from coconut oil to heavy duty moisturizers without success.  This product is making an incredible difference at a reasonable price.  Will continue to use and reorder.  I just wish I could afford more of their product line.</li>
    <li> Super light, does not sting, dries fast, and my skin is super soft. I think my pores are shrinking too, and it&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks. Try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2 months now.  I absolutely love it!  The biggest difference that I have noticed are the dark circles under my eyes have really diminished.  I&#x27;ve had a terrible time with dark circles for years &amp; I have to say this product really helps.  I&#x27;ve also noticed the wrinkles on my neck &amp; forehead have really shrank too.  I also have sensitive skin &amp; have had no reactions, which is also a biggie for me.  All around in my opinion a good buy worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love the product!  Excellent skin protection at an incredible price.</li>
    <li> Love this Vitamin C Serum!  Beginning to see some improvement in my complexion :-)&lt;br /&gt;Very helpful information and directions from Jennifer at Amara Organics- thank you!!</li>
    <li> This product has worked very well for giving my skin an even tone.  It has also helped a blemish on my son&#x27;s face as well.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I RECEIVED IT...BUT I BROKE OUT HORRIBLY AFTER ONE DAY!</li>
    <li> I like how easily goes on the skin</li>
    <li> I use several products right now, but can usually tell when a new one added to my regimen has made a difference. This has not. Initially, I gave it a fair chance, but it seems like I&#x27;m spreading plain water on my skin. Other hyalauronic acid formulas I&#x27;ve used before show the skin plumped after application, but this literally does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it one star because their Customer Service sent me a personal follow-up email within days of the purchase. It wasn&#x27;t the usual &#x27;form letter&#x27; but a very personal but professionally written inquiry as to my satisfaction. I told the person that I&#x27;m not sure if (just as I stated above) it is doing anything for my skin. She wrote me right back and again was very cordial, professional and addressed me in a personal way. So, hats off to their Customer Service team....:O)</li>
    <li> This is some great serum my wrinkles are so much lighter it&#x27;s amazing I am using this and a moisturizer that I bought and together they make me look 10 years younger, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Was very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Using this serum seems to be making a difference for me... my skin feels firm, soft and strong all at the same time.  There is no unpleasant scent like with a few other brands that I&#x27;ve tried. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! Excellent customer follow up as well. I received a personal email after my product to see if I liked it &amp; to give me some tips &amp; advice for getting the best results with my skin care routine. I can see &amp; feel the results of this product. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product foe almost 2 to 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. I will try a little longer.</li>
    <li> I have been used it for a month now, I do not see any changes.</li>
    <li> I use it every morning</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and I love the product.</li>
    <li> Does what I want and feels nice going on.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t tell much benefit after 3 months use .  I used after micro needle treatments too.</li>
    <li> Ive been using your Amara vit-c serum and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s absorbed very fast in to the skin and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like other serums do. I have used ole henriksen vit-c serum and many others in the past. Amara serum has been the best so far.</li>
    <li> I have only used for a couple weeks so I have not seen a big change yet</li>
    <li> I like how my skin glows with this thing, but it can cause minor break outs.</li>
    <li> Love the vitamin C serum.! Hope it takes the wrinkles away!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this serum, I would recommend it to all my friends. there is one question, why does it feel sticky after it dries? it goes away after I apply my moisturizer. Overall I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I appreciated email from vendor offering advice. Have used the product only for a week but already seeing improvement. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.  seriously great customer service and the product does not bother a sensitive face...(mine)&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll keep this stuff in stock.  thanks for a great product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for my skin.  The Vitamin C Serum does a great job, and has really helped my skin look and feel younger.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products for my face and this one really makes my skin brighter and helps hide the fine lines.</li>
    <li> Love this! I purchased this in hopes that it would help with some acne scarring I have on my cheeks and it has helped tremendously. First it got rid of nearly all the hyper-pigmentation and left me with even colored skin, and then it started working on the actual acne scars. I have definitely seen a huge improvement. I&#x27;m on my second or 3rd bottle of this. I&#x27;ve tried other brands that have similar formulas but I like this one the best. It&#x27;s very lightweight and not too drying.</li>
    <li> Having used vitamin oils before with limited success, I was skeptical, but hopeful. At first I thought my skin was just having a &amp;#34;good day&amp;#34; but as I continued to use the Vitamin C Serum I realized what a difference it was making. My skin is soft and dewy. I love my radiant skin and the way it feels! This product is amazing and, as an added bonus, very reasonably priced. I also appreciated the e-mail follow-up after my purchase with clear information and instructions. I dare say it is unlikely I will ever be without this product again. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Be Careful - This product turned my face to an overall redness akin to having an extremely bad sunburn. Be very careful about using this no matter your skin type. Note: I wear 46 SPF Sunscreen as a regular part of my face routine. I tested it on my neck and nothing happened - perhaps I should have waited longer or tested on a small part of my face. However, when applied to my face for approximately 1 week the change in my face color was profound. I stopped using it yesterday and hope the redness will go away ASAP. I&#x27;m applying tons of foundation and concealer to attempt to hide it. For the sake of others I strongly recommend caution with this product. It may work for most, but I suggest more caution in testing before using. It&#x27;s a bummer, because I wanted it to produce the effects the majority of the other reviewers received.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, the wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead are pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;My blemishes have faded too.  I&#x27;m very please with it, and will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> It has been only a week using the product, but I already felt the difference. My skin is more tighten !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2 weeks and already I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin tone. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great customer service, fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves your skin soft and smooth and I only just started using it.</li>
    <li> My name is ana I&#x27;m 35 Years old I love the vitamin C serumamy skin soft and healthyI&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I can see the differenceI love it the customer services is awesome great product</li>
    <li> I am a repeat customer of this great product.  I use it every evening before I put any other creams on.  It is light, easy to apply and has worked very well in helping with sun damage (along with Alpha Hydrox Intensive Serum and Souffle) and firming up my neck area.  This is a must have in your beauty arsenal.  Just remember to always apply the thinnest cream/lotion/serum first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m noticing improvement in my complexion 😊</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin drinks it in and then feels so silky.  I will reorder.</li>
    <li> Love that you get both vitamin C and hylaronic acid in one. The company is very customer friendly with emails checking your satisfaction right from the cofounder herself. Not just an automatic generated email. They fill the bottle to the very top. Loving it. Great price too. I look forward to purchasing more from this company.</li>
    <li> used this product for about a year, my daughter like it too, makes my face look with fresh looking skin, (67) and feels soft love the 4 products that this company offers, use them day and night looks beautiful</li>
    <li> I should have heeded the negative reviews. My skin looked like it had been burned after just three uses. I even tried just using it on the dark spots on my hands, but it dried them and didn&#x27;t have any positive effect. If your skin is at all sensitive, do not buy!</li>
