<li> Smells terrific and lasts long.  </li>

<li> You cannot go wrong with this one.  </li>

<li> is smelled really rank.</li>

    <li> \\&quot;Quelques Fleurs Original\\&quot; is sold with the recommendation that it be worn in the evening. Well, I wear it all day long. The warm floral sent evokes an era far more romantic and quietly seductive than our own, in which sex is in your face virtually all the time. \\&quot;Quelques Fleurs Original\\&quot; is way beyond that.</li>
    <li> my favorite scent. Always get compliments when I wear it. Not too floral and I like that</li>
    <li> A beautiful, haunting fragrance.  It always gets lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Iam 84 years old and have used this scent since before WWII It was lost as was many perfumeries during the bombings. The receipe was found again sometime in the 50&#x27;s or 60&#x27;s the only place you could buy it was at Neiman&#x27;s and you had to pay the price!!! I finally found a place to purchase it for 85.00 an ounce.  Now I got 3.4oz for only 73.00  God Bless Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product that is supposed to be the original, I still had a small amount of the original in an almost empty bottle that I had guarded carefully since the 1970&#x27;s. Not at all the same.</li>
    <li> Great deal, arrived promptly</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances ! Always get comments when I wear it for .  Am using it for years ! Very sofisticated  fragrarance !&lt;br /&gt;I like your quality  Thank you for selling it for a reasonable price !!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews saying the smell wasn&#x27;t quite up to snuff. Bought if for my wife and her response was that it smelled slightly different than what she remembers of the original bottle. I guess this is one of those scents that you pay the premium for.</li>
    <li> The perfume was in great conditions, in its original box and was an original. Will definitely buy more from this vendor.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It is the one I wear all the time. I ordered it for a friend but when she opened it the color of the product was so much darker than any bottle I have every bought for myself. I didn&#x27;t say anything to her as it smelled okay and the packaging was original. Yet, I do wonder how old was the product.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this fragrance in Dijon, France.  I loved it and received many compliments.  The fragrance was with me all day when I used it.  As for the purchase from Amazon, the fragrance is not lasting. After about 2 hours, it&#x27;s gone. I was disappointed and would not pay that much for it again.</li>
    <li> No words to describe how much I love this perfume!!! This is my husband&#x27;s all time favorite, won&#x27;t let me wear anything else :)</li>
    <li> My favorite scent of all time. I get so many compliments on it. I guess it just mixes well with my chemistry. Arrived quickly and perfect</li>
    <li> I wanted the &amp;#34;Royale&amp;#34;. I mistakenly ordered this one. I didn&#x27;t know there were other versions. This version is not as good as the &amp;#34;Royale&amp;#34;. The smell is stronger and even causes people to sneeze. I will be ordering the correct version soon, however.</li>
    <li> A classic scent that always gets noticed.  I have literally been wearing it since I was 18 years old--over 20 years.  Despite the name, it is not overly flowery.  You cannot go wrong with this one.  Plus, the Amazon price is ridiculous.  Usually it retails for $200.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as promised.</li>
    <li> An old fashioned feminine floral in the best sense. Begins green and citrusy [ though not grapefruity --thank goodness], then becomes lushly floral [ rose, carnation, lilac, jasmine, tuberose, violet--none overpowering] and dries down to something warm without being overtly spicy or musky. I actually bought it by mistake thinking I was ordering Quelque Fleurs Violettes, but I find it more sophisticated than any contemporary scent on the market -so much so that I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when the parfum arrived but when I u opened the box and sprayed it on, it smelled like it had been sitting on a shelf for years....is smelled really rank. Total disappointment!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance so next time I&#x27;ll just spend the extra dollars at a reputable store to get a fresh product. In the meantime, I put the bottle in the lavatory at work to be used as air freshener. I can&#x27;t think of any where else to use it where the existing smell would be worse than the rank smell of this bottle of parfum.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume  Often people will ask me what I am wearing</li>
    <li> I had a bottle of this cologne that I had purchased at Neiman Marcus. When I ordered this, I was amazed at the difference in price. Unfortunately, this was not a good purchase. The cologne DID NOT smell like my favorite from Neiman Marcus. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I was nervous that the product might not meet my expectations, but i was surprised it did.  Smells terrific and lasts long.  I will definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Lots of compliments from men..</li>
    <li> This is the real Quelques Fleurs frangrance at an incredible price!  Perfectly packaged and with that delicious scent.  A great bargain you won&#x27;t find elsewhere.</li>
    <li> she&#x27;s been using this for years and when she ran out she changed to another fragrance. i didn&#x27;t like it as much so i bought this to make me happy :).</li>
    <li> The fragrance arrived quickly and smells wonderful. I will not be going to Nordstrom to purchase this fragrance in the future. Most of all it was 1/3rd the cost I had been paying!!!😊😊😊😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 48....have been wearing this parfum for 20 years.....always get tons of compliments every time I wear it!  I try not to share my secret.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume online because it was cheaper than Neiman Marcus.  It does not smell the same as the original.  I went to Neimans and sprayed the perfume and compared.  It is not clearly stated that this purchase is NON RETURNABLE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this every since I had a sample of it given to me.  I can see why it&#x27;s Bae&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
    <li> Perfume was for my wife.  It is her favorite.  It was delivered on time as expected.</li>
    <li> This is the only way to go,  My fragrance is very hard to find. Not only did they have it, was less than half the price! You cant go wrong. Im one pleased customer.</li>
