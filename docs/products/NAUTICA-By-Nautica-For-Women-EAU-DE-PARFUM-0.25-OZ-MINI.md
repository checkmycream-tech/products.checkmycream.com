    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nautica for Women for many years.  I&#x27;ve never been disappointed this product until now.  The bottle contains approximately a teaspoon of perfume.  It was not advertised as a miniature.  $16.50 for a teaspoon of fragrance seems excessive.Plus when I apply it you can hardly smell the fragrance.  Don&#x27;t bother buying this product from this vendor, it&#x27;s a rip-off</li>
