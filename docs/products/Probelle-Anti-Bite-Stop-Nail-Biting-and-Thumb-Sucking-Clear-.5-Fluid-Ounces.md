      <li>I heard about Probelle through a good friend of my wife and decided to give pro belle&#x27;s anti-bite a chance.</li>
      <li>I am glad I found a product that is preventing my nail biting habits!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this wasn&#x27;t as effective as I had hoped it would be.  </li>
      <li>so this has come in handy.</li>
      <li>It has a lot of shine which looks nice.</li>
      <li>Effective for kids under age 10, and works as a deterrent for adults.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t have a problem with painting his nails</li>
      <li>/&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
      <li>my nails are noe healthy, my fingers look healthy and I stopped biting my nails!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
      <li>it also means I have to stay on top on cuticle care and nail filing.</li>
      <li>I used this product as a top coat to my nail polish.  </li>
      <li>but in truth I am struggling more with my nails than I did with the cigarettes.  </li>
      <li>I bite my nails more than anyone else</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>the more stressed I get, the more I chew).  </li>
      <li>My burger was an especially good one...until I accidentally brushed my lips with one of my nails.</li>
      <li>but I also love that it seems to make my nails strong.  </li>
      <li>We applied a light coat to her nails and the edge of skin touching them.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply to my nails and dries fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It went on easily and caused no discomfort on the skin it touched.</li>
      <li>This product goes on relatively easily and doesn&#x27;t make your nails shiny.  </li>
      <li>While the polish does lose its potency over time (it recommends applying twice weekly), be warned that it can also transfer easily.</li>
      <li>The product applied easily and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Denatonium Benzoate is the primary source of the yucky tast.</li>
      <li>I have been a nail biter my whole life and to be honest</li>
      <li>After about a week, it&#x27;s stopped him from gnawing on his thumbnail, but he&#x27;s taken to gnawing on the skin around his thumbnail which the polish doesn&#x27;t really stick to as effectively.  </li>
      <li>The satin finish was a plus for the 4 year old who totally loved having their nails</li>
      <li>Personally, I take the &amp;#34;work in progress&amp;#34; as a success because anything that gets her to stop and think about it, is good for me!</li>
      <li>That being said, it would probably be really effective if you were to use it on someone in their teens or older to stop nail biting.</li>
      <li>far as encouraging folks not to bite their nails, in short, this works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Makes her nails look pretty and took care of that issue easily-</li>
      <li>If I am serious about stopping, I am thinking the best way is going to be covering my nails and not using this product.</li>
      <li>It flakes off really quickly</li>
      <li>I painted my nails with this anti-bite polish and it dries quickly and mat.</li>
      <li>Does the job, but the taste wears of quickly.</li>
      <li>reapplying her polish is a part of our morning routine and she has nails for the first time ever!</li>
      <li>but we do get some slack sometimes from well-meaning friends and family members who worry that he&#x27;ll get made fun of.</li>
      <li>their hand out their mouth, but it will definitely give them pause, which can be effective for stopping the behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love that this anti-bite is clear</li>
      <li>It very much mimics the sheen on a natural, healthy nail.</li>
      <li>This is a problem since she is already biting when she tastes the product, so the goal of making her stop right away is not met by this</li>
      <li>and that seems right.</li>
      <li>It is still on my lips right now.</li>
      <li>--strangers generally comment about how cute he is despite, or because of, the nail polish.</li>
      <li>Maybe make it a little more potent and you&#x27;d have a winner.</li>
      <li>For this reason I think this product could EASILY be worn by females or males just over a natural nail without anyone knowing you have a polish on.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, nothing works better than this kind of negative conditioning.  </li>
      <li>A satiny polish, probelle smooths on easily and clearly.</li>
      <li>As much as I don&#x27;t want him to suck on his hand, I was even more concerned that this product would affect his eating habits, particularly as he can decide on the turn of a dime whether he likes a particular food at any given moment (</li>
      <li>My only con is that this stuff is SUPER strong.</li>
      <li>My 8-year-old is a pretty determined nail biter</li>
      <li>it works for the first 3 days, but</li>
      <li>And when he does eat, he is more likely to eat finger food (hot dogs, burgers, chips, carrot sticks) than anything else.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel that this is potent enough to deter nail biting in some people.</li>
      <li>People can notice that your nails are a bit shiny and smooth but it is &#x27;clear&#x27; as indicated.  </li>
      <li>They said that it tasted a lot like hot peppers.</li>
      <li>I first put this on, I told her it was to protect the polish on her fingernails.  </li>
      <li>fact, I got my first taste by accident, while I was eating.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a product to try and quit the habit.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really taste it until I&#x27;ve already bitten the nail off!  </li>
      <li>We have been using now for a month and its really been a nail saver!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I did have to apply it every other day to keep it effective.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;During our evaluation of the product we found that this wears off pretty quickly and has to be reapplied frequently.  </li>
      <li>I have been a nail biter pretty much all of my life.</li>
      <li>If you are using regular nail polish, I would advise using this as a top coat - the bitter taste will be more prevalent then.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very bothersome as it usually ends up with me bleeding or in a pretty good amount of pain and</li>
      <li>Fantastic product, I now have regular fingernails!</li>
      <li>a lifetime nail biter, thanks Probelle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never done much to try and stop it.  </li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t really notice it on your fingers.</li>
      <li>If you really want to quit biting, the taste will remind you to not bite.</li>
      <li>I immediately stopped as the taste really bugs me.</li>
      <li>It is worth noting that it has a matte natural finish</li>
      <li>That she might start biting her nails while she is working in a courtroom is a real concern.  </li>
      <li>really does taste</li>
      <li>and then just stick his whole hand in his mouth.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Since the polish is clear, you can&#x27;t even tell that he&#x27;s wearing anything!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, the product does not seem to be working, but to be fair, similar products from other manufacturers haven’t worked either.  </li>
      <li>This product is better than any other that we have tried.  </li>
      <li>It is simply not bad enough to be used as a deterrent.</li>
      <li>The flavor will significantly diminish after a few days so the instructions are true to form when advising application 2x per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>It has a strong, bitter taste that discourages nail biting.  </li>
      <li>it still tastes very bitter, so use utensils and it won&#x27;t take too many times and you won&#x27;t want your fingers anywhere near your mouth.</li>
      <li>The matte finish makes my nails look natural as well!!</li>
      <li>The Probelle Anti-Bite was chosen for an adult nail biter in my family who wants to stop biting her nails at work because doing so at work looks unprofessional.  </li>
      <li>So far this product hasn&#x27;t done as much as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Applied when slipping and the matte finish made him fell comfortable with the product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this for my brother that always bites his nails.. at the beginning he laughed at me because he of course will never use nail polish. But after a few days he gave it a shot.. and for a week already he hasn&#x27;t bitten his nails!&lt;br /&gt;Since the polish is clear, you can&#x27;t even tell that he&#x27;s wearing anything!!!</li>
    <li> Total waste of money.  Tastes of nothing.  Nothing at all.</li>
    <li> This is nail polish that is supposed to help you stop biting your nails because it tastes terrible.&lt;br /&gt;It really does taste terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I found it works best if I put it on after my morning shower, every day. Then the taste is really strong and really bad more quickly. After two days, the taste is milder and takes longer to notice - like you have to leave your fingers in your mouth for a few seconds before the taste &#x27;kicks in&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Also watch out - the taste seems to be transferable; when I ate finger foods, especially greasy foods, I felt like the taste got into my food.</li>
    <li> Works wonders if applied about every 2 to 3 days.  All 3 of my kids bite like crazy and this keeps them at bay for a couple days.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, I now have regular fingernails!</li>
    <li> I got this for my niece who bites her nails and cuticles constantly.. After applying and drying lets just say she doesn&#x27;t bit her nails nor cuticles anymore as its very unpleasant..  We have been using now for a month and its really been a nail saver!  Makes her nails look pretty and took care of that issue easily- My sister in law wishes she thought about a product like this before!</li>
    <li> A satiny polish, probelle smooths on easily and clearly. It definitely looks like there is something on the nail, which may feel awkward for some men who are not used to manicures. The taste has some numbing properties and takes a few moments to register, but is bitter and awkward, sort of like my ex, only more bitter. Effective for kids under age 10, and works as a deterrent for adults. It&#x27;s not so nasty that it will make an adult jerk their hand out their mouth, but it will definitely give them pause, which can be effective for stopping the behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No formaldehyde, toluene or phthalate. Denatonium Benzoate is the primary source of the yucky tast.</li>
    <li> For those who want to stop biting their nails, this will serve as a reminder and a deterrent. The taste is very bitter and will linger on your tongue and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The formula goes on like a clear polish, but you should remember to put it on thickly. A thin coat will not work so well or look as good.&lt;br /&gt;The polish and bitter taste will stay on your nails even after numerous hand washings. There is no smell to your nail after the polish dries. If you are using regular nail polish, I would advise using this as a top coat - the bitter taste will be more prevalent then.</li>
    <li> As a kid, I remember having an anti-thumb sucking solution put on my thumbs, and I wager this Probelle Anti-Bite tastes even nastier. With a strong acrylic smell until dry, it&#x27;s a clear solution that acts just like a nail polish, and lasts about as long, even after hours spent in a swimming pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got just a little bit on me after putting it on my daughter&#x27;s nails, and when I tested it out, a very bitter taste hit my tongue. While the polish does lose its potency over time (it recommends applying twice weekly), be warned that it can also transfer easily. I&#x27;d be eating a sandwich, for instance, then lick my lips only to discover the nasty taste of the polish along with my meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as encouraging folks not to bite their nails, in short, this works wonderfully. Easily recommended if you or someone you love needs to break this bad habit.</li>
    <li> Tastes terrible, worked as a deterrent for anxiety driven nail biting (my husband - he actually only gnaws on the nail on his thumb) but for the first 6 hours or so after the first coat, everything he tried to eat using his hands ended up tasting like the polish even though he was careful about not putting his thumb in his mouth.  After about a week, it&#x27;s stopped him from gnawing on his thumbnail, but he&#x27;s taken to gnawing on the skin around his thumbnail which the polish doesn&#x27;t really stick to as effectively.  We may try doubling up on the coating to see if that helps.  Overall, it does the trick, tastes terrible, smells terrible until it dries, and doesn&#x27;t have much of a shine which is good for nails that need to look natural.</li>
    <li> Our household has used similar nail biting deterrent products in the past. Our experiences with this Probelle product is similar to others we&#x27;ve used in the past where it works effectively for some but not for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredients here are marine algae and horse chestnut which (for me) provides an intensely bitter taste that lingers on the tongue for around 10 minutes and is strong enough to prevent me from any further biting. The flavor will significantly diminish after a few days so the instructions are true to form when advising application 2x per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied to your nails the clear coat liquid provides a very subtle matte finish. If you are in need of such a product to break a nail biting habit this one might be worth experimenting with provided that you re-apply every few days.</li>
    <li> I have been a nail biter pretty much all of my life. As an adult I find that I don&#x27;t do it as much unless, I am nervous or anxious about something. I stopped biting my nails a few years ago and was able to get my nails to grow by keeping them polished along with a few other things. I was so proud of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother transitioned last year and since then (and during her hospitalization) I started to bite my nails again. So I&#x27;m sitting biting my nails when I realize hey, I ordered that polish from Amazon. So I get it and put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;It has a shine on my nails&lt;br /&gt;It has no odor&lt;br /&gt;It tastes HORRIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I got my first taste by accident, while I was eating. It is still on my lips right now. You cannot even eat finger foods. I had some sunflower seeds and they tasted like the polish. I don&#x27;t see how anyone can keep biting their nails after having this taste in their mouth. I haven&#x27;t worn it long enough to experience any growth, so I will keep you updated on that part, and I will keep my hands out of my mouth for sure.</li>
    <li> My reason for ordering this product is two-fold. My four-year-old sticks his fingers and his hand in his mouth all the time. And he is always asking to have his nails painted when his sister gets hers done. I honestly don&#x27;t have a problem with painting his nails but we do get some slack sometimes from well-meaning friends and family members who worry that he&#x27;ll get made fun of. I have to clue them in that they&#x27;re the only ones who take issue with the polish--strangers generally comment about how cute he is despite, or because of, the nail polish. The hand in mouth thing is a problem though because he&#x27;s four and has little sense of cleanliness and why it&#x27;s not okay to play in the dirt or pick his nose and then just stick his whole hand in his mouth.  My concern with this product though is that the hands-in-the-mouth is an issue, but so is his being a picky eater. As in he picks at his food, when he deigns to bother with it. And when he does eat, he is more likely to eat finger food (hot dogs, burgers, chips, carrot sticks) than anything else. As much as I don&#x27;t want him to suck on his hand, I was even more concerned that this product would affect his eating habits, particularly as he can decide on the turn of a dime whether he likes a particular food at any given moment (this week, for example, he has decided he hates ketchup, strawberries, .and macaroni and cheese.  I decided to try this product on myself before I put it on him. I painted my nails, forgot about it, and we had burgers for dinner. My burger was an especially good one...until I accidentally brushed my lips with one of my nails. The nail polish definitely affected my taste buds. It has an unpleasant, bitter taste that lingers in your mouth for several minutes. Taking a drink cleared the taste in my mouth, but it lingered on my mouth.  There&#x27;s no way I can use this stuff on my toddler; it&#x27;s just too bitter. That being said, it would probably be really effective if you were to use it on someone in their teens or older to stop nail biting. The taste is so bad, I think it would be a great deterrent. But it would just ruin the appetite of a little one, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless there is a really serious issue.</li>
    <li> This stuff tastes bad, but you have to reapply it after every hand washing, so it&#x27;s not very effective for me. With multiple kids to keep track of, I can&#x27;t remember to do that for my nail biter!</li>
    <li> This does work well for stopping nail biting.  It has an unpleasant taste that it an effective deterrent but I also love that it seems to make my nails strong.  It is worth noting that it has a matte natural finish so it doesn&#x27;t give as much of a boost to the appearance of my nail as other products for nail strength and growth.</li>
    <li> I have been chewing my nails for as long as I can remember (nervous habit...the more stressed I get, the more I chew).  It&#x27;s a disgusting habit, I know, and I&#x27;ve struggled with it all my life.  I even tried hypno-therapy as a last resort in addition to anxiety medication and none of it seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, nothing works better than this kind of negative conditioning.  This nail coat simply makes it gross.  The downside is that the aftertaste doesn&#x27;t kick in right away, but when it does, you&#x27;ll quickly start remembering how nasty it is.  The only other downside if that I feel that I need to apply the stuff every 3 days (and I believe it says as much in the directions), but a little discipline and willpower will see you through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a lifetime nail biter, thanks Probelle.  My nails are slowly coming back in after having used the product for 14 days.  I&#x27;ll provide further updates and respond to comments if anyone has any questions.</li>
    <li> Both of my children, one boy and one girl, have a bad nail biting habit.  We gave this a try to see if we could break it and it helped alot.  My son didn&#x27;t mind it being on his nails because it dried clear.  They both said that it left a lingering bad taster on their lips and over time they no longer wanted to place their nails in their mouth.  They said that it tasted a lot like hot peppers.</li>
    <li> This only worked for the first couple of days, then my daughter decided she could bear it, so continued chewing on her nails. I think this might work for some, but didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
    <li> The Probelle Anti-Bite was chosen for an adult nail biter in my family who wants to stop biting her nails at work because doing so at work looks unprofessional.  That she might start biting her nails while she is working in a courtroom is a real concern.  She has tried other products in the past and saw that bad taste as a challenge rather than a hindrance.  She tells me that unfortunately, the Probelle taste does not kick in until after a few seconds.  This is a problem since she is already biting when she tastes the product, so the goal of making her stop right away is not met by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product does not seem to be working, but to be fair, similar products from other manufacturers haven’t worked either.  We will continue to try to use the Probelle Anti-Bite and will update this review in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I received this and tried it out, when you put this on your nails there is definitely a gloss/shine to it. The taste of it is pretty bitter if you put a little on your finger and touch your tongue. If you put this on your nail I found it was subdued taste and it did take a little while before I could really taste it. Overall yes it works, but I would like the taste to be a bit stronger, faster.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a similar product in the past, and really needed something as a reminder not to chew my nails, which I tend to do at work. The Probelle goes on like any clear product and dried in 2-3 minutes enough to not worry about. It has a lot of shine which looks nice. The taste is bitter, and unpleasant Day 1, almost too much, because I found if I ate something with my hands, I had a lingering bitter taste in my mouth. Also it covers some of the cuticle so no chewing them either. It does the job! Day 2 it still tastes very bitter, so use utensils and it won&#x27;t take too many times and you won&#x27;t want your fingers anywhere near your mouth.</li>
    <li> Matte finish my eye. This stuff is just as shiny as other similar products. It tastes like crap and does accomplish its intended purpose, but I bought this specifically for its \\&quot;Matte Natural Finish\\&quot; which I definitely do not see. Perhaps it&#x27;s less shiny than similar products? I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter and I were having mani-pedis recently and the nail tech showed me her hands.  Apparently she has been biting her nails.  With the amount of stress she has been under, I shouldn’t have been surprised.  We have all been under stress and so I didn’t notice.  Her fingernails are tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put this on, I told her it was to protect the polish on her fingernails.  I have been watching her and haven’t seen her biting, but then didn’t before either so what do I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am just putting it on, telling her it is to help her nails grow stronger.  Perhaps, it will.</li>
    <li> The Probelle Anti-Bite was used by both a 20 year old nail biter and a 4 year old thumb sucker. The product applied easily and smooth.  The satin finish was a plus for the 4 year old who totally loved having their nails done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The results...the 4 year old did NOT like it at all and she did stop sucking her thumb in the last two weeks of use.  At first, she tried to find a part of her finger that did not have that bitter taste and eventually just gave up all together!  The 20-year old?  Apparently, the bitter taste wasn&#x27;t quite enough to get her to quit just yet anyway. She did find the taste &amp;#34;annoying&amp;#34; enough to make her stop and think, but at present, she is still a &amp;#34;work in progress&amp;#34;.  Personally, I take the &amp;#34;work in progress&amp;#34; as a success because anything that gets her to stop and think about it, is good for me!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for my five-year-old stepdaughter at all. I put it on her nails in the evening, &amp; she had her fingers in her mouth by bedtime, not 4 hours later. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Probelle anti-bite nail polish goes on clear and dries to a matte finish so you don&#x27;t really notice it on your fingers. I find it chips similar to colored polish, then I start picking the rest of the polish off my nail.  It has prevented me from nail biting, as it has a terrible chemical taste if you put your nail in your mouth.</li>
    <li> My 8-year-old is a pretty determined nail biter so I tried this on him.  It tastes terrible and that deters some of the biting.  This needs to be applied daily if it&#x27;s the only deterrent.  It&#x27;ll take more than just a bad taste to modify a nervous habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During our evaluation of the product we found that this wears off pretty quickly and has to be reapplied frequently.  Swimming pool, beach trips, and average little boy activity will wear this product off of nails.  You&#x27;ll also need some buy in for this to work. If you really want to quit biting, the taste will remind you to not bite. If you&#x27;re relying on this as the only deterrent, it won&#x27;t work with a determined biter.  I wouldn&#x27;t want anything stronger on my child&#x27;s hand because it might get rubbed into eyes or nose and cause unnecessary pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this is worth trying if you&#x27;re looking for an anti-bite product.  We&#x27;re not giving up yet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It flakes off really quickly but when it&#x27;s staying on it definitely keeps me from biting my nails cause it tastes awful!</li>
    <li> this works as a wake up cal when i am tearing at my nails. it also means I have to stay on top on cuticle care and nail filing. which is good. it makes a nice hard clear coat.</li>
    <li> I put this on my daughters nails, and it tasted awful but it didn&#x27;t stop her by any means. If you want bad tasting nail polish...this is the one for you. If you want your child to stop biting their nails...doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Our daughter, who is nine, bites her nails and the skin that is attached to them.  When she is especially nervous, she will put her fingers into her mouth.  We got this to try on her fingers and see if it would help her stop.  We were a little hesitate when we read that the product was flammable but decided to see if it would work.  The product works like nail polish and it was almost impossible to tell she had it on once it dried.  We applied a light coat to her nails and the edge of skin touching them.  She wore it for several days, we reapplied it twice a day for almost two weeks.  We noticed her biting her fingers and nails less and less.  When we sat down and talked about what it was like, she said she didn&#x27;t like the taste.  It was a little bitter and it reminded her that she was biting her fingers and she would stop.  She has liked the results and we will keep using it until she has broken herself of the habit.  Even thought the product has worked for us, I only have one reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was concern over the ingredients.  Not only does it say that it is flammable but when you realize what ingredients are in the mixture, adults will definitely reconsider putting coated nails into their mouths,  I think for younger kids you might want to see about trying something else.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, cellulose acetate propionate, mek, isopropyl alcohol, adipic acid/neopentyl glycol/trimellitic anhydride copolymer, silica, denatonium benzoate, tocopheryl acetate, benzophenone-3, propylene glycol, helianthus annuus seed oil, aqua, ascophyllum nodosum extract, yellow 5 lake ci 19140, calcium pantothenate, retinyl palmitate, urtica dioica extract, aesculus hippocastanum seed extract, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, ferric ammonium ferrocyanide, tocopherol</li>
    <li> This product goes on relatively easily and doesn&#x27;t make your nails shiny.  It has a strong, bitter taste that discourages nail biting.  It is enough to remind you that you&#x27;re biting your nails if you do so absentmindedly.</li>
    <li> Years ago, my mother used a similar product on my sister&#x27;s nails and it helped her stop biting her nails. I was searching for it again to see if it would help my granddaughter whose nails are completely bitten.&lt;br /&gt;It went on easily and caused no discomfort on the skin it touched. As she put her hands in her mouth, it wasn&#x27;t an immediate burn or distaste, but in a few seconds the flavor was unpleasant enough that she removed her hand from her mouth. I&#x27;m calling that a win!&lt;br /&gt;Now reapplying her polish is a part of our morning routine and she has nails for the first time ever!</li>
    <li> Does the job, but the taste wears of quickly. I would probably recommend STOP over this polish.</li>
    <li> The best I ever tried</li>
    <li> This product is good.  I&#x27;ve used a couple of things on my daughter and I bought this because the other product was more expensive but according to my nine year old that is struggling quitting sucking her thumb the other product works better and stays on longer.</li>
    <li> Would this work to get your kid to stop chewing on his hearing aid? Would it paint on rubber and plastic, and does it dry to a hard finish?</li>
    <li> AGH!!! This is the nastiest, bitter tasting nail item ever!! I&#x27;m a lifelong nail biter so this has come in handy. I painted my nails with this anti-bite polish and it dries quickly and mat. I made the mistake of putting my fingers in my mouth as it&#x27;s a very nasty habit, and oh boy, it was horrible. I then put a clear coat of nail polish and inadvertently put my fingers in my mouth again, and the nasty taste was still present. I&#x27;m hoping to be able to finally kick this bad habit and this does what it says it does, anti-bite! YUCK! I received the item for a nominal fee and recommend it to anyone because it truly works and hope this helps anyone that&#x27;s trying to grow their nails.</li>
    <li> My son is almost 7 years old and will not stop sucking his fingers.  We have tried other anti-bite products and he got used to the taste or figured out how to get it off.  This works good but, needs to be reapplied everyday.  I may try putting it on his knuckles to see if that makes a difference.  This product is better than any other that we have tried.  For nail biting this should work great.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
    <li> Definitely worked on my young son. Applied when slipping and the matte finish made him fell comfortable with the product.</li>
    <li> Men usually don’t buy products for their nails or even so, care for their nails until they get married! for the past 8 years I have been biting my nails and this is something my wife dislikes big time. She bought a few Probelle products one of them the anti bite and ever since I’ve stopped the biting! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel that this is potent enough to deter nail biting in some people. I used it on my 11-year-old granddaughter and it didn&#x27;t stop her from biting her nails at all. I put it on my nails and I didn&#x27;t like it enough to bite my nails while wearing it. So, I think this is one of those things where it works well for some and not at all for others. So, I gave it a 3 star neutral rating. Maybe make it a little more potent and you&#x27;d have a winner.</li>
    <li> The taste is fairly subtle as far as an &amp;#34;anti-bite&amp;#34; product goes. It is simply not bad enough to be used as a deterrent. I put it on my fingers as well as 2 of my children (ages 11 &amp; 16) I will say that it lasts much longer than any similar product I&#x27;ve tried. After multiple hand washings, doing dishes, etc the taste remained for a couple of days after application. Unfortunately this product ultimately fails in it&#x27;s goal and I cannot recommend it as is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an off and one nail biter, and decided to give this product a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and guess what, it worksI do recommend it to all who have that bad habit.</li>
    <li> Definitely does the job to keep you from biting your nails.  The taste is enough to get you to refrain from biting.</li>
    <li> I am glad I found a product that is preventing my nail biting habits! My nails and all the area around my nail looked bad because I contantly had the habit of biting my nails. With Probelle Anti-bite my issues are finally over! The matte finish makes my nails look natural as well!!</li>
    <li> Tricked my niece into painting her nails with these. She did not like it one bit, she&#x27;s not a major nail biter but she tends to nibble on her thumb. This will keep her reminded not to do it, so I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I have been biting my nails since I was 17 years old! Throughout the years it&#x27;s been an on and off habit. I heard about Probelle through a good friend of my wife and decided to give pro belle&#x27;s anti-bite a chance. it&#x27;s been the best solution for this problem! my nails are noe healthy, my fingers look healthy and I stopped biting my nails! I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 5 year old. She still bites.. it works for the first 3 days, but then nothing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bitten my nails off and on since being a toddler.  Now in my older adult years I can go a very long time without biting but if I start it&#x27;s very hard to stop again.  I looked all over for a product like this and couldn&#x27;t find one so I ordered it.  I like that it goes on clearly but it isn&#x27;t bitter enough.  It says you don&#x27;t have to apply daily but I don&#x27;t think it lasts that long. I don&#x27;t really taste it until I&#x27;ve already bitten the nail off!  I really miss the Hard as Nails nail biting polish.  That always worked best for me.</li>
    <li> lasts me 3 days then the taste is still there but not very strong. directions say use twice a week and that seems right. tastes TERRIBLE.... which is the point. reminds me of what your fingers taste like after rolling pennies for an hour.</li>
    <li> I have been a nail biter my whole life and to be honest I&#x27;ve never done much to try and stop it.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a product to try and quit the habit.  As an ex smoker, I feel as if it shouldn&#x27;t be difficult to quit such a thing but in truth I am struggling more with my nails than I did with the cigarettes.  So far this product hasn&#x27;t done as much as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two concerns were, this would be easily seen on my nails and that when I did slip up the stuff would make me sick to my stomach.  People can notice that your nails are a bit shiny and smooth but it is &#x27;clear&#x27; as indicated.  It doesn&#x27;t stand out so to say but again, you can tell that you do have something on your fingers.  After slipping up a few times, I am relieved to report that the stuff does not make you sick to your stomach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this wasn&#x27;t as effective as I had hoped it would be.  It didn&#x27;t last on my nails as long as I felt it should and when I did go to bite on my nails the bitter taste wasn&#x27;t there right away.  If I am serious about stopping, I am thinking the best way is going to be covering my nails and not using this product.</li>
    <li> If a product could ever work &#x27;too well&#x27; this may be it.  I&#x27;m a chronic nail biter. Have been all my life.  I have to keep my nails in good shape (painted and groomed) to even serve as any deterrent to my bad habit, but even then, I&#x27;ll bite all my nails off come a stressful situation.  I&#x27;ve used other name brand anti-nail biting polishes in the past (i.e. Orly) but the Probelle puts these to shame.  I used this product as a top coat to my nail polish.  It slightly dulled the finish, but it was still pretty. It very much mimics the sheen on a natural, healthy nail. For this reason I think this product could EASILY be worn by females or males just over a natural nail without anyone knowing you have a polish on.  This is your typical, &amp;#34;Tastes Nasty&amp;#34; polish, but it&#x27;s MUCH stronger than the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.  There&#x27;s NO WAY I would bite a nail with this stuff on. And it didn&#x27;t wear off at all. I had my polish on for over a week, and it would have probably gone longer (I just got bored of the color and removed it).  My only con is that this stuff is SUPER strong. To the point that you won&#x27;t even want to get your nails in contact with your lips because your lips will start to have that taste.  And you&#x27;d be surprised off often your lips get in contact with your lips through eating or casual contact.  It kinda was off-putting because anything that did require you to use your hands to eat would taste like the polish.  So if you have a weak stomach, you may not like this. However, if you&#x27;re someone who is really trying to kick this habit to the curb and have tried other &amp;#34;less potent&amp;#34; polishes without any luck, I would highly recommend this product. I promise you, you will NOT be biting your nails.</li>
    <li> I have two children who are nail biters.  We&#x27;ve tried bribery, reward charts, and just plain begging.  Nothing ever worked.  This product has helped quite a bit.  Even though the awful taste comes a few seconds later it works.  Especially with my little one it worked well.  She has almost completely stopped biting her nails.  I did have to apply it every other day to keep it effective.  Thanks for letting me try this at a deep discount.  It has been a great help in our household.</li>
    <li> This Probelle Anti-Bite has definitely been helping me with a big problem that I have. I bite my nails more than anyone else I know and it&#x27;s very bothersome as it usually ends up with me bleeding or in a pretty good amount of pain and the only thing that stops me from continuing is putting band aids on my fingers. It&#x27;s a miracle if I don&#x27;t have a band aid on at least one finger at all times because of the amount of biting I do. I hate it but have never been able to figure out how to control it so when I came across this anti-bite I knew I had to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This anti-bite bottle looks just like nail polish and you apply it the same exact way. It is very easy to apply to my nails and dries fairly quickly. I went ahead and put my tongue onto my tongue after it dried just to see what it would taste like and boy is it gross. I&#x27;ve even forgotten that it&#x27;s there and when I went to bite my nail I immediately stopped as the taste really bugs me. I&#x27;ve had it on my nails for a few days now and the taste is still there and I will be reapplying again in a day or two since the instructions say to apply two times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this anti-bite is clear so I don&#x27;t have to worry about having any weird colors on my nails but it also gives my nails a little shine to them which I do like! I&#x27;m very happy with this anti-bite because since I&#x27;ve had it on my nails I have yet to have to put on a band aid because I&#x27;m not biting on my nails all the time! I would definitely recommend this Probelle Anti-Bite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
