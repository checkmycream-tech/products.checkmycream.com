      <li>Love the product and color.  </li>

      <li>I liked it even more at first</li>
      <li>The coverage is fantastic and it never bleeds, making Color Riche my favorite brand of lipstick.</li>
      <li>easy, breezy.  </li>
      <li>Just like the last one I always say, make sure you line your lips before putting it on because this lipstick is good but it bleeds.</li>
      <li>Excited that I found them for her.</li>
      <li>It should be a good product even it is on sale and last one.</li>
      <li>My quest to find another red just as good has proven futile.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never found a more flattering red for me, and receive many compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just a lot more work to put it on, they are not as &#x27;creamy&#x27; as I would like my lipstick to be … and I don&#x27;t think the quality is as high.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and creamy with a lasting effect.  </li>

      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
      <li>a color that was worn in the older movies.</li>
      <li>However, I can&#x27;t find it at the stores that I normally purchased it from.  </li>
      <li>It has a wee bit of the cheap lipstick feel, so I just use it on some occasions because I don&#x27;t stock all brands in my favorite Smashbox (expensive).</li>
      <li>the sunset red l&#x27;oreal paris lipstick i ordered was exactly what i wanted.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very rich colour and not an overbearing red with a little hue of orange.  </li>

    <li> L&#x27;Oreal needs to bring this one back.  I&#x27;ve never found a more flattering red for me, and receive many compliments on it.  I was saddened to find I couldn&#x27;t purchase it in the usual stores anymore.  My quest to find another red just as good has proven futile.  It&#x27;s a beautiful color that wears well.</li>
    <li> Just like the last one I always say, make sure you line your lips before putting it on because this lipstick is good but it bleeds. Come on it&#x27;s cream lipstick you gotta get it right</li>
    <li> So I like the L&#x27;Oreal brand just okay. I liked it even more at first but then I got into Smashbox lipsticks and they are my current number one favorite. I still use my L&#x27;Oreal, it&#x27;s just a lot more work to put it on, they are not as &#x27;creamy&#x27; as I would like my lipstick to be … and I don&#x27;t think the quality is as high. It has a wee bit of the cheap lipstick feel, so I just use it on some occasions because I don&#x27;t stock all brands in my favorite Smashbox (expensive). So I think a 3 star is fair.</li>
    <li> I love the Sunset Red lip colour.  It&#x27;s nice and creamy with a lasting effect.  However, I can&#x27;t find it at the stores that I normally purchased it from.  It&#x27;s a very rich colour and not an overbearing red with a little hue of orange.  So, I decided to look on Amazon and there it was and I ordered three and they were delivered in very good condition.  Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> When L&#x27;Oreal discontinued this shade I was very disappointed and started looking for it everywhere.  Aa friend suggested Amazon.  I looked and found some.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this color for years and have found it harder and harder to find in the local stores.  Love the product and color.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> the sunset red l&#x27;oreal paris lipstick i ordered was exactly what i wanted.  it was not available at the stores i frequent.  i am so happy i was able to purchase it at amazon.  no muss, no fuss...easy, breezy.  i hope they&#x27;ll still have it for my future orders.  thanks, amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick. The color Sunset Red is my favorite. The coverage is fantastic and it never bleeds, making Color Riche my favorite brand of lipstick.</li>
    <li> I am crushed that this color has been discontinued. It has been my signature color for some time now. So sad to see it go.</li>
    <li> The lipstick is the same as it has always been. It is a beautiful color. I wish they still made it.</li>
    <li> I received  the lipstick that seems used. That is fake. That is my worst shopping on  Amazon. It should be a good product even it is on sale and last one.</li>
    <li> Wish L&#x27;Oreal still made this color!</li>
    <li> Was so glad I could find this color lipstick again--a real favorite.&lt;br /&gt;This L&#x27;Oreal lipstick is absolutely the very best.&lt;br /&gt;You will love it.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick.  The color is warm and lasts all day.  Not too red.  I was happy to find it here since I can no longer find it in stores.  It&#x27;s the perfect shade of red.</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Just what I was looking for.  Mom couldn&#x27;t find in any store. Excited that I found them for her.</li>
    <li> Best color L&#x27;Oreal makes. Shame they discontinued it.</li>
    <li> This shade blends perfectly with my skintone.  It is vibrant and lively, without being gauche or flashy.  So dissapointed the L&#x27;Oreal has discontniued it.</li>
    <li> This is really a bright color that should be worn when you are dressed up. It reminds me&lt;br /&gt;of a color that was worn in the older movies.</li>
    <li> I Love it!!  It is such a shame they don&#x27;t sell this color at a store anymore. Elusive..  Even better!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lipstick. she used to wear it years ago but then could never find it in the stores anymore &amp; was disappointed. She&lt;br /&gt;started looking online &amp; was happy to find it. Thanks!</li>
