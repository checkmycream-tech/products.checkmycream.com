      <li>Great for light skin.</li>

      <li>It adds a nice glow.</li>
      <li>I used it mainly to warm up my face, not for contouring since it has some shimmer in it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice because there aren&#x27;t gigantic chunks of glitter.</li>
      <li>It just gives you a nice glow, but you can layer for added color.</li>

      <li>The shipping was fast, the bronzer worked well and has lasted longer than most bronzers I&#x27;ve bought, which is especially great considering</li>
      <li>NARS hits the spot just perfect though, allowing me to create shadows that look natural and blend in well with the rest of my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best bronzer on the market by far.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous light bronze powder with some shimmer.</li>

      <li>The more I used it the more</li>

      <li>I love the NARS brand.</li>
      <li>Imagined it to be more bronze-er.</li>
      <li>Laguna bronzing powder makes my skin look healthy and glowing.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>Next to MAC, this is the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

      <li>Not to mention, I love the fact that I can purchase it on Amazon without have to go to the department when I run out.</li>

      <li>For more tanned beauties, I would suggest looking elsewhere or trying darker NARS</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>Never skimp your bronzer because it&#x27;s the most noticeable make up when worn.</li>
      <li>I love this bronzer.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Expensive, but the best for my Celtic complexion.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason this bronzer has a cult following. You CANNOT beat it. It&#x27;s the best bronzer on the market by far.</li>
    <li> I have medium tone skin and Laguna adds a beautiful glowy touch without making it too obvious that I am wearing a bronzer. I think it would work on most shades of skin for a subtle glow or a defiant bronzer if you have very light skin. I would not recommend it as a contour due to the fact that it is not dark enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I speak highly of NARS blushes and bronzers because they blend easily. It is extremely difficult to mess up a NARS product because they&#x27;re soft, blendable and gorgeous.</li>
    <li> This bronzer is really awesome. It&#x27;s such a pretty color, kind of has some sheen to it. Great for light skin.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product from the excellent NARS range. If it&#x27;s a natural sun kissed glow you are trying to achieve then this is it! I don&#x27;t buy anything else because nothing else comes close. Lasts for hours even under great humidity like we have here in the South Pacific.  Use sparingly on very clean natural glowing skin or on top of a very light foundation or tinted moisturiser and head out of the house and wait for the compliments to flow! A staple in my collection.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this bronzer! I cant wear it unless i am very tan but this bronzer is amazing definitely better than any other bronzer i have tried</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer! It&#x27;s so nice to have and fun to use. The color is so sexy and flattering on the skin. Not shimmery, very Mat, but has a glow. Looks flawless.</li>
    <li> I have been using this bronzing powder for years and just now got around to reviewing it. It has a wonderful, subtle sheen, so it doesn&#x27;t look flat and pasty, but also not too shiny. It&#x27;s a beautiful brown-toned bronze, not orange (and my skin picks up orange very easily). I can&#x27;t imagine using a different bronzer. This is the lighter version of the Nars bronzers, which is perfect for my fair/light skin. For darker skin, you would want the Casino color.</li>
    <li> I was not too crazy about this to begin with since I thought it was just an overpriced bronzer, and it kind of is. The more I used it the more I loved it but I&#x27;m not sure if I would repurchase since this is very expensive. I used it mainly to warm up my face, not for contouring since it has some shimmer in it. The shimmer is not noticeable on the face, it might show up in bright sunlight though. I use shimmery blushes and I prefer matte bronzers.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this bronzer in the Laguna shade. I never would have selected it for myself and wasn&#x27;t really expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. Next to MAC, this is the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used. It gives me subtle color without a lot of sparkle. The Laguna color is light enough that it&#x27;s perfect for my fair skin, and doesn&#x27;t make my face look orange. I can apply just a dusting for a very natural look, and build up the color if needed. I love this product and definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Perfect. New. I love this product it is a much more natural look. Delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Great summer bronzer. My go-to!</li>
    <li> Satisfied with the product, beautifully finished, well pigmented, good quality, I use it as blush cheeks with excellent results. What you purchase.</li>
    <li> Natural looking bronzer . Healthy glow with no orange tint</li>
    <li> My favorite bronzer! Blends well, great color if you want the perfect bronze glow for a medium to light skinned (not for fair though) caucasian or asian. I started using in college after a friend introduced me to Nars products and now we all still years later use the same bronzer and won&#x27;t change! Has very very subtle glitter look to help make your skin glow as well and not just look brown like some bronzers (or look like a glitter queen like others). My go-to for life</li>
    <li> This is the best bronzer ever! Looks so pretty on your skin! Not orange looking!  You will love this bronzer!</li>
    <li> I use this bronzer everyday- it&#x27;s been over six months and it&#x27;s still has about half left. I take it with me everywhere and it&#x27;s never cracked or broken like MAC bronzers. A must buy!</li>
    <li> Up to my NARS standards in terms of application, wear-time; it goes on smoothly and stays on the whole day. Having said that, the pigmentation is not up to my usual NARS standards. Considering this is such a dark color in the pan, I would expect it to go on at least as dark. It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s very sheer. Because I am extremely fair skinned, it&#x27;s okay. For more tanned beauties, I would suggest looking elsewhere or trying darker NARS colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply with a Kabuki brush over my foundation. I put it over the tops of my cheeks and the middle of my nose (right where my freckles are) to give a nice sun-kissed look. It has a red undertone, which really makes it look like a natural tan. It&#x27;s nice because there aren&#x27;t gigantic chunks of glitter. In the online picture it looks like there are gold sparkles, but there aren&#x27;t. Only a very subtle golden sheen.</li>
    <li> Best bronzer ever. Maybe a little too dark for some people but I prefer a glow year round. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have shimmer which annoys me in most bronzers.</li>
    <li> I very much enjoy this bronzer.  I have fair skin and can use it (a very limited amount on my brush).  This is a good color for even my fair skin tone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because of the reviews AND I love NARS products.  This bronzing powder provides a nice \\&quot;tan\\&quot; look. I probably won&#x27;t purchase it agan. I&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
    <li> Best bronzer I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> This was a purchase for my wife because I noticed that hers was down to small pieces. Package arrived in her name; wife was surprised and happy so I was happy. Happy wife, happy life!</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer, it is a great color and last a long time. Quick delivery and the make up was nicely packaged. Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Good seller.  Fast delivery, will recommend to my friends. About products, I like it so much, so delicate and without red pigment, it will good for pale skin too</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer.  I have fair skin with slightly yellow undertones and I find this looks flattering on me.  It&#x27;s richly pigmented, yet easy enough to apply so it looks natural.  I also like that there is a very, very slight shimmer to it that gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> NARS Laguna is described as a “diffused brown powder with golden shimmer.” It’s a medium-dark brown with warm, yellow undertones and a golden shimmer-sheen finish. It has more buildable color payoff than full-on, rich pigment. The texture was soft, lightweight, and blend-able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NARS bronzing powders are the most used bronzers in my professional kits compared to other high-end makeup brands. The shades are pretty much universal. There are only three shades, but yet there&#x27;s something to fit everyone&#x27;s complexion. Not matte, with slight golden shimmer, yet isn&#x27;t over powering, enough to give the skin a natural inner glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NARS Laguna bronzing powder makes my skin look healthy and glowing. It gives me an effect that makes me look radiant and natural. The bronzing powder is diffused with golden shimmer, which creates all-over warmth. I typically like the bronzing powder in the color Laguna because it contours my face perfectly and enhances the look of tanned skin. Since the powder is not matte, the powder fills in lines and pores for a smoother, more even looking complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pigmentation of this product is phenomenal. In my case, I find I only require one quick swipe being needed to contour and bronze on my current skin tone and it leaves me looking natural and not caking or encouraging my skin to turn into an oily mess. Sometimes I use this all over my face to warm up my complexion. With the golden shimmer, it acts more of an illuminator rather than leaving glitter scattered all over my face and is subtle enough to contour with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, NARS bronzing powders are iconic shades ideal for all skin tones, leaves skin natural looking with an imperceptible finish, and shimmer which adds glow.</li>
    <li> This is a great bronzer just as other reviewers said - natural looking, easy to apply without a heavy hand.</li>
    <li> This is a basic part of my make-up routine all year round. It&#x27;s subtle enough that it gives a natural, warmer look to my face.  I use it after my foundation and brush it on my entire face and neck.  Lasts  a long time and doesn&#x27;t crumble in the compact.</li>
    <li> I am a caramel skin tone and so I thought this color would give me a sun-kissed glow, unfortunately it is the same color as my skin. I like NARS products just picked the wrong color this time.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer, super natural looking.. Never \\&quot;dirty,\\&quot; or \\&quot;orange.\\&quot; This stuff is great! I have purchased this repeatedly and I rarely buy the same product twice. I&#x27;m always looking for something better... so that says a lot. Have not found any bronzer to match the natural-ness of this. I apply it w/ my MAC187 on the forehead/temple/cheekbone area. Gives definition/dimension to my round Asian face. Love it!</li>
    <li> The color may not be for everyone. While it looks great with my olive skin and dark hair, my friend with light skin and blonde hair comes off looking a tad orangey so she won&#x27;t use it. I wish the price was a few dollars less. They amount they give you in the compact is deceiving. Its actually a very thin layer of bronzer in that palette. So if you&#x27;re an every day wearer of bronzer be aware of that - it disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;overall it is a good product.</li>
    <li> Good natural looking bronzer that blends well. Doesn&#x27;t really have much shimmer to it but can really be spiced up with some good highlighter on top of it.</li>
    <li> No more orange face! This is a high quality bronzer that goes on smooth and looks very natural. It warms your face. This color is best for fair to medium complexions.  You can always layer more for a dramatic finish or just put a splash of a pink/peach on the apples of your cheek to compliment the bronzer.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Goes on evenly and smoothly with great coverage, but doesn&#x27;t look orange and fake like a lot of grocery store brands I&#x27;ve tried. I ran out a few weeks ago and picked up some cheaper stuff to use in between, and I miss my Laguna SO BAD. Night and day difference.</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer.  Makes my face look tan and very natural.  Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I cannot live with out this bronzer. All i do is put on concealer in a few trouble spots and powered with this and POOF! Amazing</li>
    <li> this is the only makeup line i use. it does not break you out or leave your skin oily throughout the day!</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, the bronzer worked well and has lasted longer than most bronzers I&#x27;ve bought, which is especially great considering it&#x27;s expensive make up. Makes you look brown and not orange. Love it. Never skimp your bronzer because it&#x27;s the most noticeable make up when worn.</li>
    <li> I just got a fluffy new bronzer brush and love the big size. I had been using this color in a combo pack with Orgasm, and was happily surprised to see that this was much bigger than the normal blush size (it is the same size as some of their face palettes, so pretty great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this color because it isn&#x27;t too shimmery and is totally great for everyday wear. I have fair-medium skin and this is a great color to contour my face.</li>
    <li> The Laguna bronzing powder by NARS is fantastic! I have tried several bronzing powders over the years, both expensive and inexpensive and this one is by far the best i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Everyday use, perfect color for my medium skin tone and dark hair. Lasts a long time too. I buy a new one of this size about every six months.</li>
    <li> No problems. Great product.</li>
    <li> The only bronzer I&#x27;ll use!  It&#x27;s not orange and it doesn&#x27;t have an absurd amount of shimmer or glitter in it.  It actually looks like it&#x27;s part of your skin.</li>
    <li> I mean, what more is there to say. It is NARS. NARS has a cult following for a reason. I have very, very fair skin with a touch of red and this bronze color works well. I use it to frame my face. Its not quite matte enough for contouring in my opinion, but I think thats debatable. Highly recommend for anyone just looking for a simple bronzer!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of red in my complexion, and most bronzers leave me looking orange.  I&#x27;m sticking with this bronzer for years, because the color works well to tone down my skin and add a healthy glow.  It applies well and is easy to add where I want it.</li>
    <li> My Favorite Bronzer! Been using it for years. So notural not orange and soft looking.</li>
    <li> I never know what color will work with my skin tone (asian) and this one worked out great.  It&#x27;s very natural looking and buildable so it will start off light and you can just keep adding until it&#x27;s just right.  I also have sensitive acne prone skin and have not had any issues.</li>
    <li> Love this, been using it for years on my NW25 skin. Gives the perfect glow, never breaks me out. LOVE</li>
    <li> This shade is so light that you could put it all over your face and it wouldn&#x27;t look strange. Imagined it to be more bronze-er. It&#x27;s OK, they make great products, but it wasn&#x27;t what I had envisioned.</li>
    <li> Christmas present every year for my daughter. She love it and its the only bronzer she ever uses.</li>
    <li> I love the natural glow.  Doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;orangy&amp;#34; and I only apply it once in the morning.</li>
    <li> My favorite bronzer hands down</li>
    <li> Used for years..love it!</li>
    <li> I bought Laguna and I have a light golden tan. It shows up on my skin but BARELY. It adds some warmth but I think next time I&#x27;ll go for a bit of a darker shade like Casino to add some contours to my cheekbones and to better highlight the angles of my face. These Nars bronzers are great quality though, and they don&#x27;t have that horrible orange pigment that a lot of the drug store brands have and even a few of the higher end stuff. Definitely worth a try and worth the money if you pick the right color. Even though Laguna is a little too close to my skin tone, I still wear it every day over moisturizer and concealer and paired with a little blush because I love the way the light bounces off of it and gives me nice glow.</li>
    <li> application was smooth - the trick is finding the correct shade.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend this for friends to try if they are looking for bronze makeup.</li>
    <li> it works great  ! i have used many different bronzers before i got to this one  , it really changes the look of your make up !!</li>
    <li> I kept hearing how great this was. I dont usually wear a lot of make up. This color is actually not in your face bronzer. Its just enough to define. Very subtle.</li>
    <li> This color works with all year long! I&#x27;ve been buying Laguna for years and would never go to another bronzer</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product. Comes well packaged. In good condition.  The makeup sets you&#x27;re foundation beautifully and lasts all day long. I would recommend it for all skin types.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous light bronze powder with some shimmer. Nars Laguna is my new favorite Bronzer its very light weight and gives a gorgeous tan glow</li>
    <li> I can NOT live without this product. i wear it on a daily basis...it goes on so nicely and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
    <li> I love this bronzer. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Bare Minerals, to Sephora, to Cover Girl and this by far is my favorite. It looks dark in the photo but it goes on fairly light and looks natural. I have fair-to-olive skin and I use this to help bronze and give my skin that natural glow. A little bit goes a long way so this product will last.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff. Finally I have found a bronzer that does not make me orange or look overly fake. It gives a nice glow and stays on for a long time. The best part is that it does not rub off onto my clothing!</li>
    <li> Love this line. I use this bronzer on a daily basis and it is a very natural look. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, after using this product, I really question if it is authentic. It does not apply the same and the color seems different from the one I bought from Sephora..</li>
    <li> I like this bronzing powder. I was recommend it because the person LOVED it. I like it, but it&#x27;s not my absolute favorite. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few bronzers, and im not the biggest makeup junkie i really just try to go for a natural look...and this gives me the perfect glow, definitly recommend this color!</li>
    <li> NARS makes a great powder bronzer.  The color is perfect so you don&#x27;t look like the \\&quot;tanning mom\\&quot;.  You will have a natural glow with this powder.  Works great with the Orgasm blush, too.</li>
    <li> This is the best bronzer out there. I have fair skin and while it looks so brown in the compact, it looks amazing on. Just use sparingly with a big brush and you will be fine.</li>
    <li> LOVE Nars bronzer! Great product that holds all day long. Matches my skin tones just right and blends easily! Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> I have a skin really white and when i put this procuct in my face rarely seen, but i think the products NARS are amazing !</li>
    <li> By far the best bronzer that i have bought. I only use it for special occasions though so I don&#x27;t run out so quickly and its a bit expensive. Now I just need to learn how to contour properly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of bronzers / dark foundations for contouring, but usually they either turn out orange or I can&#x27;t see the color at all. NARS hits the spot just perfect though, allowing me to create shadows that look natural and blend in well with the rest of my skin. A+ would recommend to anyone with light skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted the cream bronzer not the powder!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice color but VERY brown-no pink in it at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using NARS bronzer in Laguna for years.  It is by far the best bronzer I have tried thus far.  Never leaves you with an orange tinge.  Excellent quality!</li>
    <li> Much darker than anticipated. I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> A great subtle bronzer. It just gives you a nice glow, but you can layer for added color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard everyone talk about this bronzer for a while and decided to try it out. it came &amp; honestly I wasn&#x27;t impressed, thought it would look muddy...but holy crap is it the most amazing bronzer ever.</li>
    <li> The best bronzer ever!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using NARS bronzing product for the past 3 years and love their products.  Not to mention, I love the fact that I can purchase it on Amazon without have to go to the department when I run out.</li>
    <li> If you are thinking to use this as contour then don&#x27;t bother.. The color may seem dark in the picture but when applying it you will have to put several layers ( more than 4) to get to that same shade. I would say it would work better as a blush but you will still have to apply it several times to get any color on your cheeks.</li>
    <li> Bought if for my daughter since she goes away in Canada. The price was much cheaper than there and I received it very quick. Very happy with the product. Even with the exchange and the price it was about 10 cheaper in the US than canada</li>
    <li> I love this product, and purchase the special applicator brush to use together.</li>
    <li> Good wish it were a bit darker but good</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE bronzer!  It is great in the winter and not too light in the summer when you are tan either.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and swear by it!</li>
    <li> Love nars powder but i go though it so fast! There is barely nothing in this compact for the price. I just switched to two faced this month we will see how it goes !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup on my face, but I love this bronzer. It adds a nice glow. Great product!</li>
    <li> I recommend Nars products, especially the Laguna bronzer. I have bees using it for years and love that I can order it online as it is not available in stores where I live. A little on the pricey side but worth every penny. It came in original unopened box with layer of plastic Nars protector over the cosmetic.</li>
    <li> This is the best bronzer out there, it looks natural and it goes on so easy. I love the NARS brand.</li>
    <li> Tried and true been using this for years.</li>
    <li> its not the best bronzer out there a little dirty looking on the face if over applied but good color</li>
    <li> the reviews are true - this stuff is lovely. I have really fair skin and it works well on me - I&#x27;d imagine most skin tones would be fine with this. it lasts for at least a few months with daily use so I guess it&#x27;s a good value? I trust it.</li>
    <li> Like it better than Lancome&#x27;s bronzer.  It goes on well and doesn&#x27;t look fake.  I have bought again and will probably keep using.</li>
