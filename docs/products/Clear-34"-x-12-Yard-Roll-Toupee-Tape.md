      <li>Works great, no irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I put a four inch piece of tape on the wig and make sure it&#x27;s secure.</li>
      <li>You need perfect eyesight razor sharp finger nails  </li>
      <li>works well and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>FOR SOME REASON IT ABSORBS SWEAT EASILY &amp; WILL LIFT.  </li>
      <li>The ordering was easy and the product is fine.  </li>
      <li>I am a wig maker and i would recommend this tape for anyone look for a more secure yet comfortable fit.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a burlesque dancer, this is THE most economical way to get pastie tape</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s super sticky</li>

      <li>BUT, this tape works great for mounting hidden microphones (with Rode Invisilav silicone mounts).</li>
      <li>It sticks to the surface very well, yet the protective tape is easily removed</li>
      <li>The fact that we use oil (light) on our hair, the tape loosen up to fast.</li>

      <li>Used the tape on the back of pasties recently with great success!  </li>

      <li>Exactly the right size</li>
      <li>It is clear strong and discrete.</li>
      <li>but I make sure my head is clean and dry before I put on the piece</li>
      <li>skin with alcohol first for adherring power.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the tape would hold enough to finish the show even after peeling off the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Which in this case is theater; dinner theater to be exact.</li>
      <li>I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
      <li>Fine for daily use, a nightmare for party animals and lip syncing contests.</li>
      <li>so my bra stays covered the whole day</li>
      <li>I bought this to use as bra tape and it works really well.</li>
      <li>Super stick to the skin, but not so much plastic pieces such as the R0DE mic invisiLav plastic attachments.</li>
      <li>Now I know better and wipe the skin down well before adhering the clothes / accessories.  </li>
      <li>It sticks just okay on African American curly textured hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t wipe down the skin with alcohol, and it was a hot day, so the sweat ate through the adhesive immediately.  </li>
      <li>My son is sensitive to adhesives.</li>
      <li>Sticky enough to last a few days, this is a quality product that will treat your favorite &amp;#34;puppy&amp;#34; like royalty.</li>
      <li>I expected the tape to have a little more adhesive.  </li>
      <li>When taking it out (since it was taped to my skin), do it slowly and you will be fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it works well for keeping clothing and small woodland creatures in their place for other scenarios too.</li>
      <li>I have a pair of thigh high socks and it keeps slipping.</li>

<li> I play a dual role in which the first character wears a bad rug (which I also got here on Amazon.com) and the second character is follicle challenged (my natural state).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a tape that would hold the piece in place but still be easily removed at the proper time without needing solvents or other time consuming cleanup.</li>
<li> This is such a big roll of tape it will last me a long time.  </li>
<li> super sticky but a little hard to peel back.</li>
<li> Then I get about 1/4 inch of the backing paper started and fold it back tightly leaving the tab for me to grab later and put the toupee back in it&#x27;s storage pack.</li>
<li> Wish it were a tad bit stickier, but it gets the job done as long as you don&#x27;t jog, are a drag queen doing shows, whipping your hair back and forth, etc.</li>
<li> It works, but other brands that come in short strips are easier to work with.</li>
<li> This tape prevented my thigh highs from slipping.</li>
<li> Not much to say about it.</li>
<li> this is nothing like I expected it to be, it start loosing up just after 3 days.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this tape for those who wear behind the ear hearing aids.</li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore than other tape being peeled off skin.</li>
<li> This keeps them attached without irritating her sensitive skin.</li>
<li> We shot in the sun in 90* heat for about a half hour with no problems.</li>
<li> I would recommend this for anyone whose hearing aids have a tendancy to fall half way out at times.</li>
<li> I would tear the paper slightly, which would stretch but not break the plastic tape.  </li>
<li> less residue</li>
<li> and it has held tight every time so</li>
<li> Held my wig tight all night.</li>
<li> just a little patience is all it takes to get a corner of it started after which the rest peels off with ease.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The only bad thing is it&#x27;s a bit difficult to remove the backing paper.  I would tear the paper slightly, which would stretch but not break the plastic tape.  The amount is generous as well.</li>
    <li> super sticky but a little hard to peel back. After a few times you learn the trick. Held my wig tight all night.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I am a burlesque performer and use it for costume. It works like a charm!</li>
    <li> good price and good product</li>
    <li> I use this to adhere my daughter&#x27;s cochlear implant processors to her head.  I put a strip on the processor only and then stick it to the skin behind her ear.  She is a head sweater and the tape will last all day at school, recess, and P.E. and into the night.</li>
    <li> Great tape and arrived on time!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wish it were a tad bit stickier, but it gets the job done as long as you don&#x27;t jog, are a drag queen doing shows, whipping your hair back and forth, etc. Fine for daily use, a nightmare for party animals and lip syncing contests.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a burlesque dancer, this is THE most economical way to get pastie tape</li>
    <li> It&#x27; maddening to get the backing off this tape You need perfect eyesight razor sharp finger nails  I ruined most of the roll learning to get it to work Once I did It holds my toupee very strongly</li>
    <li> This was a reorder of a product that has always been great. I plan to keep on ordering as often as needed.</li>
    <li> This tape is great for securing object (cochlear device) to the scalp. Regular double sided tape didn&#x27;t do the job</li>
    <li> This tape works as advertised and would buy more if needed.&lt;br /&gt;So far after almost 3 weeks it still holding.</li>
    <li> I have been pleased thus far with the quality and ease of use of this tape.  It sticks to the surface very well, yet the protective tape is easily removed</li>
    <li> Used this to hold a strapless dress in place.  Worked great.</li>
    <li> Walker tape is excellent for usage with baby hearing aids on my granddaughter.  The item was @ great price and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> The tape was okay.  I was a little disappointed based on the reviews I had read.  I expected the tape to have a little more adhesive.  It sticks just okay on African American curly textured hair.  The fact that we use oil (light) on our hair, the tape loosen up to fast.</li>
    <li> Sticky enough to last a few days, this is a quality product that will treat your favorite &amp;#34;puppy&amp;#34; like royalty. Buy with confidence!</li>
    <li> We are using this instead of fashion tape because my skin gets irritated by fashion tape. For those of you who don&#x27;t know, fashion tape is used to tape clothes to skin for fashion purposes or to prevent nip slips. Works great, no irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but it seems like it will work.&lt;br /&gt;  Jg</li>
    <li> My son is sensitive to adhesives. I use small pieces of this to keep his over-the-ear hearing aids in place on him. Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> this is nothing like I expected it to be, it start loosing up just after 3 days. I will be ordering from the company that I have used befoe</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both used this tape on the top of our strapless dresses (upon the advise from the bridal shop) and were exceptionally pleased with the holding properties of this tape for this application.&lt;br /&gt;Wipe skin with alcohol first for adherring power.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to secure insoles added to my shoes.  Does the job.  Holds well, but is still removable.</li>
    <li> I use these for placing lavalier microphones on people. It works, but other brands that come in short strips are easier to work with.</li>
    <li> okay, was expecting more from this product. Not much to say about it.</li>
    <li> Works well and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Great way to keep my blouse front closed!</li>
    <li> Works great to keep my son&#x27;s hearing aids in place!</li>
    <li> I have started cosplaying and this was supposed to hold up costumes quite well. In example My Jessica Rabbit which is backless and strapless needed to be held up some how. So I bought this and it stayed on all day. I highly recommend it to others. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore than other tape being peeled off skin.</li>
    <li> Our baby has hearing loss, and keeping her aids in is a struggle. This keeps them attached without irritating her sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Cannot use. Extremely poor adhesion.</li>
    <li> Very nice tape... less residue</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it because I cannot get the cover paper off</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this tape for those who wear behind the ear hearing aids. This tape will hold them without having to worry about losing them.&lt;br /&gt;Ebb62</li>
    <li> Didnt stick well at all on me -__-</li>
    <li> I have a pair of thigh high socks and it keeps slipping. This tape prevented my thigh highs from slipping. I wore it all day and there&#x27;s no problems. When taking it out (since it was taped to my skin), do it slowly and you will be fine. This tape is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about toupee tape because it sounded like a more expensive version of fashion tape, but it works WAY better than fashion tape and is a lot stickier, too. It&#x27;s great for holding on wigs or for momentarily sticking something to your face if you&#x27;re in a rush. I&#x27;m a costumer and a performer, so this tape is a godsend.</li>
    <li> I had a project I was doing at work that I needed this for and it was just what I needed.</li>
    <li> awesome, exactly what I needed and plenty of it!</li>
    <li> Great holds my wig in place</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as bra tape and it works really well. It&#x27;s super sticky so my bra stays covered the whole day and I don&#x27;t have to pay a fortune for it like most bra tapes. I&#x27;m sure it also works great for toupee&#x27;s as well, but can&#x27;t confirm that.</li>
    <li> This is such a big roll of tape it will last me a long time.  It&#x27;s just the right width, and I can cut the length to any size I want.</li>
    <li> Good adhesive strength. Plenty of tape on each roll.</li>
    <li> Sticks perfectly, does not tear my skin off. Exactly the right size and nobody can tell I&#x27;m a bald fake and a liar.</li>
    <li> works great fast delivery</li>
    <li> This works so well with my hearing aids. I am so happy. Great product. I would recommend this for anyone whose hearing aids have a tendancy to fall half way out at times. This takes care of this problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually using this tape to adhere costumes to skin.  The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t wipe down the skin with alcohol, and it was a hot day, so the sweat ate through the adhesive immediately.  Now I know better and wipe the skin down well before adhering the clothes / accessories.  Used the tape on the back of pasties recently with great success!  We shot in the sun in 90* heat for about a half hour with no problems. I will buy this again for sure!</li>
    <li> Which in this case is theater; dinner theater to be exact. I play a dual role in which the first character wears a bad rug (which I also got here on Amazon.com) and the second character is follicle challenged (my natural state).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a tape that would hold the piece in place but still be easily removed at the proper time without needing solvents or other time consuming cleanup. Enter 3M toupee Tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency to perspire but I make sure my head is clean and dry before I put on the piece and it has held tight every time so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to but if I did need to put the critter back on my head I&#x27;m sure the tape would hold enough to finish the show even after peeling off the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing the backing paper is a touch difficult but that&#x27;s necessary to keep it in place and just a little patience is all it takes to get a corner of it started after which the rest peels off with ease. Before I leave my house I put a four inch piece of tape on the wig and make sure it&#x27;s secure. Then I get about 1/4 inch of the backing paper started and fold it back tightly leaving the tab for me to grab later and put the toupee back in it&#x27;s storage pack. When I get to the show all I have to do is &amp;#34;peel~n~stick&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Okay, okay.... I am not bald. BUT, this tape works great for mounting hidden microphones (with Rode Invisilav silicone mounts). I&#x27;m sure it works well for keeping clothing and small woodland creatures in their place for other scenarios too.</li>
    <li> The tape works perfectly and is priced reasonably.  Excellent value for the money.  I will certainly purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The ordering was easy and the product is fine.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use this on dresses to keep my top from spilling out. The tape holds everything in place and is a great deal because it comes with so much.</li>
    <li> FOR SOME REASON IT ABSORBS SWEAT EASILY &amp; WILL LIFT.  BETTER THAN MOST</li>
    <li> not as tackie as I thought it would be it works not like I hope it would I would like it to be more tackie</li>
    <li> I have had great experience with the brand Vapon and this is an excellent price. I intend to re-order soon. Your service and products are great .</li>
    <li> Super stick to the skin, but not so much plastic pieces such as the R0DE mic invisiLav plastic attachments.</li>
    <li> I am a wig maker and i would recommend this tape for anyone look for a more secure yet comfortable fit.  This tape is perfect! It is clear strong and discrete. My client loves it</li>
    <li> Best thing we have in our production kit.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stick to anything!!! And not returnable!!!</li>
    <li> bought this to attach my son&#x27;s hearing aids.  works well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works as I hoped--to enable multiple uses of nasal strips</li>
    <li> Good price and just the right size I wanted</li>
