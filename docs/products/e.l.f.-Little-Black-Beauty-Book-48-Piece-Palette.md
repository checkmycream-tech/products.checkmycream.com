      <li>I love these eye shadows.</li>
      <li>I love the way it glides on great, stays on for hours and vibrantly.</li>

      <li>This is the WARM edition which is exactly the colors I use.</li>

      <li>was totally excited about getting this one,  until I tried it.</li>
      <li>The colors are fantastic in the set, and are true to tone on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very surprised at how much I liked this.  </li>

      <li>Not only are the eyeshadows great, but it comes in such a cute book!</li>
      <li>, it is super fun and the colors are easy to work with.</li>
      <li>For the price this little book is pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>a makeup pro....colors are true to picture....</li>
      <li>believe that this palette would be wonderful for someone newly introduced to makeup, young women, or someone who likes a very natural makeup</li>
      <li>bought the warm set and the colors are perfect for the fall and for creating either a natural \\&quot;everyday look\\&quot; or smokey eyes since the palette blends really well.</li>
      <li>Good for the price, but next time I&#x27;ll pay a little bit more for better quality :)</li>
      <li>yes there is a variety of colors but most of the brighter vibrant colors are muted when you put it on.</li>
      <li>One thing though - the shadows tend to slip and slide on your face when applying so make sure to either apply it with a flat top brush or</li>
      <li>Very pretty colors.</li>
      <li>The colors available in the palate are exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>I bought an ELF B.B.B very similar to this and the eyeshadow itself was FANTASTIC!! ...</li>
      <li>She uses it on a daily basis, because it has great neutral tones that can be used on a daily basis for day or night.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is a great set especially for the add-on price of only six dollahs!</li>
      <li>I love the &#x27;natural&#x27; colors and these give me a very flattering look.</li>
      <li>The colors are really nice, I&#x27;m always a sucker for a nice container and the look of it closed is adorable.</li>
      <li>48 shades is enough for me :).</li>
      <li>Especially considering the low price, such great quality!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the colors stay on pretty well throughout the day and don&#x27;t crease.</li>
      <li>The shadows are super blendable, VERY pigmented and stay on VERY well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s highly pigmented and I love how it&#x27;s in a cute little book.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s color is really pretty, and it&#x27;s really portable!&lt;br</li>
      <li>usually has a good reputation when it comes to dupes.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t show up well without primer very well.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t have much 2 lose.</li>
      <li>It lasts the whole day.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>I really like the selection.</li>
      <li>Seeing as mine was much cheaper than Amazons, I wasn&#x27;t too concerned.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>few pluses to this item is that is conveniently packaged, with a nice sized mirror.</li>
      <li>I love the colors though I&#x27;ve only used like 5 colors as of thus far.</li>
      <li>but I do use it quiet often and love to experiment with the different shades.</li>
      <li>So many colors to choose from, can mix &amp; match different looks daily.  </li>
      <li>I have a hard time telling warm from cool colors except for the obvious.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I Love Love ELF products! This little black book of eye shadows is absolutely my favorite. The colors are all very pigmented and beautiful. I love the way it glides on great, stays on for hours and vibrantly. Especially considering the low price, such great quality! I will continue to buy and use ELF products. Love how the book conveniently fits in my purse.</li>
    <li> I love this ELF book.  So many colors to choose from, can mix &amp; match different looks daily.  Fantastic purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought my little black book on clearance at a box chain store. It was about $4. I LOVE the shadows in this set! The shimmer is great, there are a great variety of colors, both matte and shimmer. I love the &#x27;natural&#x27; colors and these give me a very flattering look. Look for a better price, but it is a great product!</li>
    <li> I use this book to make my friends as well as others look great. I&#x27;m eager to try out all the shades as they all look interesting. Wether you&#x27;re looking for a solid natural color or a shimmery shade this palette provides it all. It&#x27;s a convenient size that takes up little to no space compared to other things. If you want eyeshadow that lasts with good quality and great hues this is the one for you. I love e.l.f cosmetics!</li>
    <li> For the price this little book is pretty awesome. The colors are really nice, I&#x27;m always a sucker for a nice container and the look of it closed is adorable. really good buy.</li>
    <li> You know what, this might be the best eye shadow pallet I have ever owned...and suprisingly it&#x27;s by Elf....Elf is known to make \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; beauty products and cosmetics hence the quality is always crap...BUT this little black book is taking the company on the whole new level. The colors vary from intense to natural, matte to metallic shimmery in variety of shades. This is the WARM edition which is exactly the colors I use. The shadows are super blendable, VERY pigmented and stay on VERY well. I have had this palette for almost 2 years now and although I don&#x27;t use it DAILY (Which I could If I used make up every day) but I do use it quiet often and love to experiment with the different shades. One thing though - the shadows tend to slip and slide on your face when applying so make sure to either apply it with a flat top brush or if you are using a fluffy brush do not put a lot of product on it otherwise your under eye area will need to get a touch up after you are done with your eyes</li>
    <li> Nice colors, good value, compact for travel or purse. Stayed on all day! Cute packaging would make a great stocking stuffer at the holidays.</li>
    <li> I bought it again. It&#x27;s color is really pretty, and it&#x27;s really portable!&lt;br /&gt;And I can use different colors everyday!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It goes on so smoothly and it can be as subtle or vibrant as you want it</li>
    <li> ....this product is $5 on eyeslipsface.com. Do not get ripped off!!!!! This is an outrageous price! Great product at a horrible price! Beware.</li>
    <li> Although the powders might be a little cheaper, I can&#x27;t say I can complain. The colors are great for me and are great blending together.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow is really great for the price!!!!  So many great colors to blend and it comes in a really cute magnetic \\&quot;book.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have a hard time telling warm from cool colors except for the obvious. I tend to lean toward the natural colors instead of flashy. This is perfect for me. It&#x27;s got every shade of warm and only warm colors in it so I know it&#x27;ll go with my skin tone. The colors go on light but you can make it stronger buy adding more. It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smear yet it&#x27;s easy to wash off. I would definitely buy this kit again.</li>
    <li> I love these eye shadows. Although i thought the product was going to be larger, the color pay off was wonderful for me.</li>
    <li> Small palette.Very pretty colors. They don&#x27;t show up well without primer very well. Good for the price, but next time I&#x27;ll pay a little bit more for better quality :)</li>
    <li> Gift for my middle schooler to practice w....not actually allowed to wear it out, til high school...by the time she is old enough, she&#x27;ll be a makeup pro....colors are true to picture....none were broken or damaged.....this is actually a brand that some girls use in their makeup tutorials on YouTube , and for price...haaappppy.....it&#x27;s a Christmas gift btw....if I have any complaints, I will letcha know.</li>
    <li> I bought an ELF B.B.B very similar to this and the eyeshadow itself was FANTASTIC!! ... but I ended up having to throw mine away because some eyeshadow cracked/broke and it mixed into all of the other ones and the lipgloss.</li>
    <li> This kit is very nice the colours are neutral which is what I wanted. The colours are not a lot so you would find that the ones that you use often would finish faster. The quality is very good and I love the case it came in, easy to carry around and a good buy got the price.</li>
    <li> Cheap and doesn&#x27;t last long. Good for beginners.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how much I liked this.  I bought it for my 13 year old daughter but kept it for myself.  Had to get  her something else.  I really like the selection.</li>
    <li> lovely colors,  perfect for my latina complexion!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It&#x27;s very handy, I bring it wherever I go. It&#x27;s so cute, it looks like a little book, you wouldn&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s a make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the product is really good. It lasts the whole day. I highly recommend this and will order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> This deserves 5 stars for what it is.The colors available in the palate are exactly what I was hoping for. Mostly neutrals with a few outliers to let you experiment without having to spend money on something you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ll use on a regular basis. The packaging is really great too. It has 48 pieces, yet it folds up so its even smaller than ones of similar or smaller size that stay flat. With the use of eye-lid primer I&#x27;ve noticed the colors stay on pretty well throughout the day and don&#x27;t crease.</li>
    <li> I love the colors though I&#x27;ve only used like 5 colors as of thus far. It&#x27;s highly pigmented and I love how it&#x27;s in a cute little book.</li>
    <li> The colors are so lovely for morning and evening</li>
    <li> Nice, good quality colors.</li>
    <li> Poor, poor quality.  Barely comes off onto the brush and then is smudgy on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain for the price, but I ended up giving it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great little box of eye shadow.. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very pigmented and last for a long time</li>
    <li> The best part about this book is that if you have this one, and maybe the beach beauty one also by ELF, you have almost all of your makeup packed for vacation. The beach one has blush and bronzer in it, so all you would still need to pack is foundation, eyeliner, and mascara (and whatever other products you personally use.) There are some FLAWLESS shades in here, great for day or night. I love this palette. I got it for 4 dollars at Marshalls.</li>
    <li> I love this little compact. It&#x27;s a perfect size and includes a variety of colors that are very complimenting. I am most certainly purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> My makeup brushes can&#x27;t get any of the color on them. I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is, as e.l.f. usually has a good reputation when it comes to dupes.</li>
    <li> The colors are fantastic in the set, and are true to tone on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the warm set and the colors are perfect for the fall and for creating either a natural \\&quot;everyday look\\&quot; or smokey eyes since the palette blends really well. However, I don&#x27;t recommend using the applicator. I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or anything like that, but personally I go for a brush because I feel the applicator wand kinda just \\&quot;slaps\\&quot; the color on instead spreading it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a great set especially for the add-on price of only six dollahs!</li>
    <li> I normally am a huge fan of elf products, but not this one. I have been looking for a decent decent dupe to Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked, (of course) and finally decided that this one seemed like it was worth a shot. I ordered it from Target, one of my faves, and it took an incredibly long time to arrive. Seeing as mine was much cheaper than Amazons, I wasn&#x27;t too concerned.&lt;br /&gt;I was totally excited about getting this one,  until I tried it. I believe this was a bad choice for me, mainly because a lot of the colors are so similar in hues, and have a strong golden undertone. Being fair skinned with a pinky undertones in my complextion, this doesn&#x27;t work at all. Plus a lot of the colors barely seem to show up at all on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this palette would be wonderful for someone newly introduced to makeup, young women, or someone who likes a very natural makeup look.&lt;br /&gt;A few pluses to this item is that is conveniently packaged, with a nice sized mirror. It is very cute, attractive casing, and has exceptionally little fallout.</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure about buying this product because it was by elf but I figured just 5 bucks, I don&#x27;t have much 2 lose. I have medium brown eyes and this palette is absolutely perfect for brown eyes. I love all the eyeshadow shades, just make sure to use a good eyeshadow primer so it will stay all day. Highly pigmented will be buying atleast 30 more of these!!!</li>
    <li> The make up is great I&#x27;ve had the little black beauty book before warm &amp; collections.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing was the pallet on the left side had come unglued from the front cover part so its just a little annoying</li>
    <li> This is an uggly little box.. It wont close properly so i cant take it out.. Evento with that, the colors are nice</li>
    <li> I bought my mom this kit for Mother&#x27;s Day and she loves it. She uses it on a daily basis, because it has great neutral tones that can be used on a daily basis for day or night. Over all great product and prizing, I Love e.l.f cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it is super fun and the colors are easy to work with. I&#x27;m in highschool, and I bought the warm colors book. This is surprisingly small, and it fits in my school bag very well. the shimmer ones shimmer, and the matte ones are matte. very easy to blend, and I like this better than my MAC eyeshadow!&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I&#x27;m in highschool, and I don&#x27;t feel that these are too &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; for girls (or boys??) my age. It all depends on how you wear it, but I&#x27;m given the chance for evening makeup and daytime makeup too. LOVE this.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this 2 years ago, and I still haven&#x27;t used up any of them. Maybe I should throw it out because of the age, but can we all remember that powders don&#x27;t hold/grow germs like creams do.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this, hope you buy it and love it too!</li>
    <li> yes there is a variety of colors but most of the brighter vibrant colors are muted when you put it on. The cover of the book fell soon after I got it though it can be hot glued back on. Besides that I used this palette for prom as a cheaper option so for the price I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Not only are the eyeshadows great, but it comes in such a cute book! 48 shades is enough for me :). I love this and recommend it to anyone thinking about purchasing it.</li>
