    <li> My absolute new favorite polish color! It looks fabulous with a matte top coat</li>
    <li> Great periwinkle color. Formula rocks.</li>
    <li> Love the color... absolutely beautiful :-)</li>
    <li> The color in the bottle and on my fingers is not nearly as solid and vibrant as shown.  Not sure how many layers are on in the pictures to get it to look that way.  Disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this color and it is perect for spring! :)</li>
    <li> Color isn&#x27;t as dark as shown</li>
    <li> Love love love the unique color! OPI is the best.</li>
    <li> A fun color, like spring lilacs!!  Packaged well, came fast, THANX</li>

    <li> Absolutely beautiful color.</li>
    <li> my gf loves it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its not to flashy perfect for mademoiselle</li>
    <li> My favorite color EVER, and I have a ton of nail polish! This purple is perfect and everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> Beautiful shade! Absolutely adore this shade. However it needs 3-4 coats. Although, I must say it is so worth it! To me this is a periwinkle shade but more on the purple lilac side. Really love it. Highly recommend:)</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and product is great.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured,  pretty purplish with a suckle hint of blue</li>
    <li> Very eye catching!! Lots of compliments. Very beautiful color</li>
    <li> Love this color opi is very pretty you only need two coats that&#x27;s great.😃</li>
    <li> The polish was awful. Wasn&#x27;t the color I was expecting. Maybe a bad batch. Who knows. The seller refunded me promptly. No problems. Look for another color.</li>
    <li> Pretty color.  I get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Love it. As many other colors in the Euro Centrale Line, I love the formula of these polishes. Beautiful colour.</li>
    <li> Look the color. Have to put on 3-4 coats for true color.</li>
    <li> Color is lighter than depicted on website. But OPI never disappoints as far as wearability.</li>
    <li> This color is so cute it looks just like the picture. it came super quick and it great packaging. I will be ordering more colors</li>
    <li> This product is extremely watered down! I put on FOUR COATS and it&#x27;s still not as bold as the photo color advertised. I love OPI products because of their great quality so I was very disappointed in this sellers cheap quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money buy it in the store to ensure you get what you expect. The color is beautiful but if you have to use half the bottle to get the desired result it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a specific color and this one does fit the bill. I had to apply four coats however to achieve it.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this color! You can&#x27;t tell from the picture but it has tiny sparkles in it that just makes it even prettier. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. The only bad thing is that it need three coats. I&#x27;ve used it two times already and both times I&#x27;ve left it on for about two weeks without a chip.</li>
    <li> the item arrived in bad condition. the nail polish was all watery, I have purchased online nail polish before and this was the first time seeing the quality being so bad as it has been either really old that is not useable anymore</li>
    <li> A bit watery, but I just make sure to put on extra coats. Love the color!</li>
    <li> Super cute color and got here WAY ahead of schedule. It&#x27;s the same color as shown in the pictures with a little shimmer as well. In just one application it became my favorite polish. The absolute only downfall to this polish in my opinion is, as an opi fanatic, this color is a lot thinner than what I&#x27;m used to from this particular brand. It&#x27;s not bad though. I did 2 coats and got the desired shade but you could even do a third coat. Which for opi, i believe is kind of weird because their polishes are usually pretty opaque BUT for this color, totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Got alot of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Such a great color! I get compliments all the time!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Needed four coats to make it opaque though.</li>
    <li> Thank you!! I was so excited to receive the nail polish, but I even more impressed with the customer service and professionalism of this company.  The product was A1 Quality!! THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> Color is very close to the one pictured. Perfect for a spring color. I love O.P.I. nail polish it is definitely of high quality than those at the local drug store.</li>
    <li> OPI is a little expensive, but they always looks great and go on nicely. The color looks exactly like it does in the picture.</li>
    <li> Love the color, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colors and goes on great and lasts long</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery  the color  was not as bright as i though  it was voing to be but still liked the color</li>
    <li> in love with this color💖</li>
    <li> in my opinion this isn&#x27;t really good for me (I am in my 50s) this is more pastel that the photo looks on my system - still pretty.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color and I&#x27;m not a fan of the color purple. But this is really pretty</li>
    <li> This is a great lilac colour with hints of blue. Yes it does take 3 coats to get good coverage but it is so gorgeous and lasts a while without chipping.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t wore this nail color yet, but I painted one nail and the color is so amazing. Its the perfect summer time or spring color. The purple is just a tad bit lighter than the pic idk if its because I used just one coat, but Im sure w two you will get the color in the picture.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this amazing color by OPI. it makes my white skin look tan which is also a bonus. As with all OPI nail polishes, the brush is great and the consistency of the polish is perfect.</li>
    <li> Paid for this nail polish but never got it really desepointed  really like amazon but my last 4 orders never came</li>
    <li> Love the color . It just started cracking in a few days . Idk what&#x27;s wrong maybe it&#x27;s me .</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish!  Every time I wear it, I receive many compliments!  You have to apply multiple coats though.</li>
    <li> Giving this a one star because I recieved the wrong nail polish I got this instead.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Excellent nail polish.</li>
    <li> Love love love this color. So excited to do my nails later! Awesome seller!</li>
    <li> The FUNEST color Ever!!  You&#x27;ve got to try it. I mean, it chips just like all polishes, but the color is so pretty. I am a very pale person, but is flattering to my skin.. Your friends will be jealous.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful light purple nail polish. It looks great alone or paired with Lucky, Lucky Lavender. It seems to be pretty long lasting as well.</li>
    <li> Product as described, No complains</li>
    <li> Great price for OPI nail polish. Even at Walmart this retails at 8.50-8.75. The color is just as pretty as it looks in the picture.</li>
    <li> Love this pastel color.</li>
    <li> A beautiful lilac color with just enough of a grayish undertone to wear into the fall and winter. I love it.</li>
    <li> The color looks great but it takes about 3 coats. The bristles on my nail polish brush were a little messed up when I got it, but it still works fine. Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful periwinkle color!!!  It applies beautifully and is very noticeable, I love it!!!  My friends love it too, such a pretty color!</li>
    <li> The exact shade of purple I wanted.. Love this color. Looks like I got a manicure at the Salon, great quality polish.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews that said these were fake. The polish was just as described and exceeded my expectations. They are real OPI.</li>
    <li> I received this polish today.  It&#x27;s really pretty it&#x27;s a little bit lighter in color than what I expected but nevertheless beautiful!</li>
    <li> Really nice love it got so many compliments but FYI u have to put at least 3 coats :)</li>
    <li> I really, really hate the name of this product. However, the color is gorgeous. The photo doesn&#x27;t do it justice at all.</li>
    <li> Nice color.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous  purple , lasts for weeks</li>
    <li> As pictured. Great color, great price.</li>
    <li> This color was a complete shock for me...i thought it was going to be just a simply purple polish but its so much more. Depending on what i wear it can look purple..or gray...or even a little bluish! Its like a chameleon polish!... A great buy!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same color in picture</li>
    <li> I got it on time and it&#x27;s a good  shade, I just thought it was darker other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is my favorite polish right now. The color really works with my skin tone. I&#x27;m pale with a yellow undertone, though I think this is just one of those polishes that works for all skin colors and tones. Two coats is all I need and it doesn&#x27;t chip easily at all, but when it does it touches up really well. It does take a little bit for is to dry completely, but it&#x27;s worth the wait. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice shade for Springtime. Needs a few coats to really obtain the color I prefer, but still very nice.</li>
    <li> Cool color. I use it only every now and then for something different rather than my standard pink/rose/red colors.</li>
    <li> The picture is pretty accurate to the color. I&#x27;m currently wearing it and I&#x27;m obsessed! I try different colors on all the time but I always come back to this one. LOVE!</li>
    <li> This color is great and I can&#x27;t wait to use it.  It is a great light purple shade and will be great for the spring and summer months.  I have a lot of OPI purple colors and this will work for the times I want a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> Really attractive color. I get many compliments when I&#x27;m wearing this color....</li>
    <li> Item as described, fast postage.</li>
    <li> This color is the best i ever had! Must have</li>
    <li> its a little translucent, the color requires a few coats. I was nervous at first when buying a previous seasons color, but the texture wasn&#x27;t dried out or sticky. They definitely took care of the polish.</li>
    <li> Perfect shade for spring.  Same great quality from OPI.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color, but in my opinion the color looks different in the picture provided than how it looks in person.</li>
    <li> this color is so cool and refreshing... i recommend this color for any and everyone its not too bright its actually just right.</li>
    <li> Great I love all i purchased</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed with this polish. I ordered it from Amazon because I could not find this color is stores and it was a bit cheaper. HOWEVER it still cost more than I am willing to spend on a nail polish that requires more than one coat. I had to apply FOUR COATS to get any of the color. It was almost as if someone used half of it then filled it up with nail polish remover. I love this color, but I was under the impression that This really expensive brand of polish was the creme de la creme of nail polish, I was expecting a nice, thick polish to evenly coat my nails, instead I got a watery polish that took HOURS to dry because it needed so many coats. So if you are considering this polish, just keep in mind that the color is fabulous, but only if you have the time and money to waste. I do not 👎💅</li>
    <li> I love the color but it can be a bit streaky and definitely requires at least 3 costs. This got to me quickly and in nice shape.</li>
    <li> Appears to b watered down</li>
    <li> The color is super pretty, but it takes multiple coats to get the color right. Love it overall</li>
    <li> This color takes several (4-5) coats to cover the nail.</li>
    <li> Love this color. Always stands out. If you have done out in deco by opi it&#x27;s the same color family. But this is a great pastel for spring n summer!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color.  Goes on nice.  Lasts 5-7 days when combined with Seche Clear Base coat and Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat. (That top coat is AWESOME as long as you read the directions and put it on while polish is still wet.)</li>
    <li> My all time favorite nail polish color.</li>
    <li> Oh. M. Gee.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best color on the planet and it was shipped super fast</li>
    <li> This polish is actually very sheer.  i thought it was going to be an opaque purple reminiscent of OPI&#x27;s &amp;#34;Rumples Wiggin&amp;#34; but it wasnt :( It takes 5 or more coats to achieve the color in the picture.</li>
    <li> Another beautiful OPI shade!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Live the color.</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate summer shade for me. The color is knock out, draws attention--I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments. OPI products are excellent--colors strong and true, coverage excellent--in some cases one coat is all it takes.</li>
    <li> I get complements on this nail polish all the time, it&#x27;s a very pretty lavender/bluish color and it has the slightest shimmer to it. I even had a friend who ordered this color for herself and a friend of hers. It&#x27;s pretty on fingernails and toenails.</li>
    <li> I love it! So pretty! Stay long</li>
    <li> Nice periwinkle color-leans more lavender than blue</li>
    <li> Bunk product! Extremely watered down. Very thin. Definitely not legit OPI.</li>

    <li> This is a great spring / summer color.  Got many compliments when I use it, and I have used it quite  few times already.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is such a beautiful color! It has a faint shimmer to it, but it reads as a creme finish. I used all of mine and need a new one, actually...</li>
    <li> I love OPI, I normally do not purchase anything other than this for myself. I would always pay the extra amount compared to other products due to the quality that all OPI provides.</li>
    <li> Perfect color. Nice and soft 2 coats will work just fine.</li>
    <li> Loved this Color and it was very well packaged!!</li>

    <li> I love OPI!! This is one of my favorite colors I just tried it today and love it! The color is smooth and the perfect Lilac.</li>
    <li> opi is one of the best. Great coverage and color quality. Lasts longer than the rest. This color is very cute and fun. Great for spring. It&#x27;s a little lighter in person than the picture so you made need 2 or even 3 thick coats for that brighter, deeper color.</li>
