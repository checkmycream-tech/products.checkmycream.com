      <li>and honestly I don&#x27;t think this happens to everyone.</li>
      <li>It was nice not to have my jaw and teeth hurt in the morning.</li>

      <li>I have had my latest one for 6 months.</li>
      <li>Especially the pads that goes between the teeth are impressive.</li>
      <li>and it is so much better.</li>
      <li>I would rather have a form fitting mouth guard.</li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s much better than the boil-and-bite models.</li>
      <li>THAT WAS BETTER THAN THIS PRODUCT</li>
      <li>Wedging these bite pads into your molars forces your mouth to be opened more.</li>
      <li>Although it worked, many times it would shift in my mouth or I would find myself chewing on it.</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t be ordering any more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the wife likes not hearing my grinding teeth anymore.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This mouthguard is the one to get, I&#x27;ve had too many boil types that don&#x27;t work well to spend my money on anything else</li>
      <li>Either way this mouth guard made me feel like it was some sort of acient torture device. :)</li>
      <li>Hope some of you others are having better</li>
      <li>I read many reviews on this product before I purchased it.  </li>
      <li>I AM GLAD</li>
      <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t actually fit in place I found I had to kind of suction it in place.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this guard for about 3 weeks and like it a lot, much better than the &#x27;boil and bite&#x27; type.  </li>
      <li>Most people who clench or grind will stop once they begin to wear this.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>way more manageable.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve got a Slim-Comfort guard with more durable bite pads that doesn&#x27;t dig into my gums.</li>
      <li>I sleep so much better with this.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found the device uncomfortable to use and it was not effective in my case.  Try a few other (cheaper) products first.</li>
    <li> Saved my teeth. My dentist wanted hundreds more than this item. You need, get one.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried about using a guard that did not snap into place, but I did not have a problem keeping it in my mouth all night.  It was nice not to have my jaw and teeth hurt in the morning.</li>
    <li> I had previously tried boil mounth guards but found them very bulky and uncomfortable.    This one is really small and a lot less inconvenient. Especially the pads that goes between the teeth are impressive. They do not feel hard to bite, but still after 2 months of wear there is not as much as a mark, even though I bite quite hard.    Really great product.</li>
    <li> I found this mouth guard very unconformable. It&#x27;s too big. I purchased the DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit and like it much better.</li>
    <li> I have had every different type of guard and this is the one! After reading sleeprights 3-step self-help philosophy. I get it</li>
    <li> i wore this thing for three nights. the whole \\&quot;one size fits all\\&quot; thing is complete bs, and it shifted my right upper wisdom tooth; it is DEFINITELY worth the extra money to go in and get the custom-fit real deal from your dentist. This thing gave me more of a headache than grinding my teeth ever did. i sincerely wish i never bought this. Please, save yourself some time and money and don&#x27;t bother with it.</li>
    <li> This item hurt so bad that I had a hard time sleeping. It may work over time, but I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to find out.</li>
    <li> I am always grinding/clinching my teeth at night so my dentist suggested I by a night guard.. This one is extremly comfortable and is deffiently helping me in realizing when I am clinching my teeth so I can relax my jaw.. You can tell its working, after the first couple of night my jaw was sore, which means its working!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid clincher and have used sleep right products for years. I had originally always purchased the low profile guard without bite guards. Although it worked, many times it would shift in my mouth or I would find myself chewing on it. I decided to switch to this guard with the bite wings on the side. I thought the wings would irritate my checks, but it has been incredibly comfortable and I seem to be clinching less, meaning no more headaches in the morning. I have a small mouth and this has surprisingly worked great! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have a slight overbite and so my teeth only touch (properly) in a few places.  So, the bit plates on this product feel a little strange in my mouth, and actually prop my mouth open wider than I would like (and making it hard to keep my lips closed during teeth, causing a sore throat).  The bite plates are also a little thick for my liking.  They probably do this to ensure the product lasts, for people that bite/clench/grind hard.    Other than the above issue, I think this product is pretty good!  The adjustability of the angle and the depth into the mouth are both easy and work well.  It doesn&#x27;t trap nearly as much fluid as other mouth guards (that fit over your teeth like a retainer).  Also, it really does conform to your mouth (at least the smooth band that goes in the front of your lower teeth does).</li>
    <li> So far this has been a great mouth guard.  I&#x27;ve used a few of the normal (athletic-looking) type of dental mouth guards and this one provides easier closure of my mouth, allows for me to talk a little easier, and in general is less noticeable.  The pads a little thicker, so hopefully my grinding doesn&#x27;t damage it too quickly.  I&#x27;ll update should anything happen to it.</li>
    <li> I need to wear a mouth guard every night or I wake up with a bad headache (not a fun way to start your day).  I have tried pretty much every type of night guard on the market over the years and I must say this was by far the worst.  I tried it for an entire month before giving up and going back to something else.  The main issues I see with the item include: its not nearly as customizable as it should be, the bit wings are too thick, and all the pressure from grinding is isolated on just a few teeth.  This last issue causes tooth pain and not just the usual soreness.  Purchase a custom dental guard from your dentist if you can afford it.  Otherwise, buy something you can boil then carefully customize yourself.</li>
    <li> Hi there!&lt;br /&gt;I originally view this product on TV . And I was interested!, not only for the function but for the price as well&lt;br /&gt;I say this because my mother payed to the dentist a massive £200 for a plastic moulded, designed to help to protect her teeth and the muscles benith her jaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How ever!!!! The product form me was good I woke up in the morning still with this product in my mouth, untill recently I had a gum infection on the bottom right of my \\&quot;bigger teeth in the back\\&quot;, which I think is due to a detail of the item (the little edge on the bottom side of the sylicon structure), which is pushing down the gum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards</li>
    <li> This is my third or fourth mouth guard that I have purchased over the years.  I am a heavy teeth grinder and find that this product is worth the money spent.  The paddles that cover the teeth are stiffer than the previous guard I purchased and I&#x27;m hoping that it protects my teeth better.  Since it is different in feel than my last one it is going to take time for me to get used to it but I don&#x27;t feel there will be a problem once I do.  I have never purchases a guard from my dentist because I refuse to spend the money.  These mouth guards last me about a year so they don&#x27;t last forever but I don&#x27;t think you can really expect them to.</li>
    <li> I used to get the grind-no-more night guards. This is just the more semi-permanent solution and it&#x27;s got different slots so you can customize it to the size of your mouth. The wiggling part feels funny at first but I have a weird way of grinding my teeth and instead of seeing crazy amounts of bite marks, the part let my teeth slide so they wouldn&#x27;t damage each other. The part that goes into the lower lip is SOOOO much more comfortable than the grind-no-more. I barely feel it. It&#x27;s not bulky and super easy to take care of. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> I needed a no-boil mouth guard because my mouth is too sensitive to handle the process of boiling.  This one has been great!  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a couple weeks now and it&#x27;s very comfortable and does the job.</li>
    <li> Having used lots of different dental guards for severe bruxism, I finally found this one which has done a much better job even than guards custom made for me by dentists. The guard even has started correcting my uneven bite (as the dentist has confirmed), done in the night without any work involved :-)  If you grind a lot like me, you may find that they don&#x27;t last forever though - I need a new one every 5 months or so.  Be sure to ask the seller to send you the latest version of the Dura - the company (SleepRight) has updated the model in the last couple of years, with major improvements to the bite pads (wider and thicker) and a less flimsy wing design. I have once received the old version from a seller here on Amazon and had to give it up since it moved out of position during the night and therefore didn&#x27;t work to prevent grinding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this guard for about 3 weeks and like it a lot, much better than the &#x27;boil and bite&#x27; type.  It stays in place all night with no irritation and seems very durable.  Best of all, my sore jaw and tension headaches are greatly improved.  I highly recommend this product and Dental USA as the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve now used this guard for one year and recommend it highly!  That&#x27;s right, the same guard has lasted for one full year and is still going strong.  Whenever it finally wears out, I will be ordering another without question.</li>
    <li> This is a great night gaurd for people that grind or clench their teeth at night. I have been a grinder for over 5 years and have recently started using this product. It is better than the one the dentist made for me, and like 80% cheaper! Great deal and does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. great product. I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Much less expensive than a trip to the dentist. However might be the cause of my needing a bite adjustment.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product because it was so floppy and unstructured and the one-size-fits-all bite pieces were so wide that it was hitting the back of my tongue and made me gag and even with the adjusted connector on the smallest setting was still sticking out of my mouth.  It was awkward and I couldn&#x27;t sleep with it in and even when I fell asleep with it in, I took it out in my sleep.  It is durable and flexible and even adjustable, but I would not recommend it for small mouths.</li>
    <li> I have used  these bite blocks for years for severe bruxism (teeth grinding) and have been very pleased with them.  My dentist liked them well enough to recommend them to other clients.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and does what it is meant to dol&lt;br /&gt;None of that sucking tooth encasing guards on and off your teeth.</li>
    <li> Not a perfect solution to my obstructive hyponena; however, it works as intended with no BPA or Latex. Durable and easy to clean. Cost effective solution.</li>
    <li> Dentist said I grind my teeth when sleeping which explains the occasional morning pain that resembles start of abcesses. Now there&#x27;s no more pain. It&#x27;s adjustable, comfortable and does not obstruct breathing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the sizes available for these SleepRight night guards and it really came down to the bite pads being too thick. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the design and materials used seem of high quality, but even after a month - I was not used to this product in all the different sizes. I would wake up with cuts in my mouth (the bite pads have a harder plastic pivot) and a sore jaw from keeping it open at a certain angle (unanimous with all sizes). I think the design can use a little more refinement and it may be very good one day. I switched over to the Dentek \\&quot;copies\\&quot; and they actually work better for me. They come in packs of 2 for the price of 1 of these as well (just make sure you get the ones that have the blue bite pads). You can give it a try and may have success with this one.. but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1&lt;br /&gt;I had to use my old pair as backup because my current night guard needed replacing. I&#x27;ve found these to actually be more comfortable if you adjust the bite pads to the narrowest setting holes (most forward). Perhaps this is partly due to how your jaw pivots towards the back. Wedging these bite pads into your molars forces your mouth to be opened more. Having them closer to the front allowed my mouth to be more closed during the night.  I&#x27;d easily give it closer to 4.5 if the bite pads were more comfortable. I&#x27;ve had to actually revert back to the SleepRights because the Dentek&#x27;s were lacking in durability and the adjustment notches on them don&#x27;t quite work (only 1 out of 4 pairs worked) Just thought I&#x27;d share this update.&lt;br /&gt;Comment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had ok luck with these for a while, but recently either they changed the bite pads or I&#x27;m grinding a lot more. I&#x27;m finding the bite pads breaking apart much sooner. I&#x27;ve had to use their warranty 3 times within 6 months when these are rated to last at least 6 months each. The problem with the bite pads is that they almost \\&quot;flake\\&quot; off in chunks once they meet a certain threshold (think ofhow fish fillets come off in flakes). With other night guards, they just keep getting squished into an unusable state (either due to shape or holes forming) but for the most part they at least stay together. These I&#x27;m finding that I have to prematurely retire them because I don&#x27;t want a big chunk coming off when I&#x27;m sleeping. Hope some of you others are having better luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside is, they have great customer service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not as impressed with the product as I am from the one I have from the dental office.  Not bad though for the price. It&#x27;ll take time to get used to.</li>
    <li> I tried using this for a couple nights and just cannot get used to it. It&#x27;s very uncomfortable, rubs my gums, and makes me slobber! It&#x27;s impossible to sleep with.</li>
    <li> This guard is great, it really is comfortable and seems durable (haven&#x27;t slept with it yet). I can speak way better with this than the boil and bite guards and this actually allows me to close my lips comfortably without force. It feels great and I believe it won&#x27;t let me down compared to the boil and bites which hurt my gums and teeth so bad that I unwillingly spit them out during my sleep. It has four settings for mouth size and comes preset to the \\&quot;average\\&quot; mouth size. There is no worrying about messing up this guard because to make into your mouth size is very simple.</li>
    <li> This is the only mouth guard I will use.  After trying other brands including the kind you boil, I will never buy another brand again.  My headaches have gone and my teeth don&#x27;t ache anymore.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Product does what it advertises and fits reasonably comfortably in the mouth.  The lower band that fits across the lower front teeth to keep it in place tends to &#x27;ride up&#x27; the teeth there, making the device feel less stable in the mouth.</li>
    <li> This a great way to determine if a custome bite guard will work. Inexpensive and easy to follow instructions. Would recommend for night grinders.</li>
    <li> This is junk; does not fit in your mouth or does what it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard and bulky. It is definately a waste of money.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003WL42JY Sleepright Dura Comfort NO BOIL Dental Night Guard]]  This product was amazing. It arrived sooner than the predicted date, and packaged nicely. I am pleased to say that the product has done my teeth well. It has been a great protection against my grinding. Just like most things, it took a few days to adjust and get used to. I now wake up in the mornings with NONE, or very little pain in my teeth when i do grind intensely over night, and no more headaches!! For the very low price that this product cost, it has done so much. I plan on buying some extra ones so that I have a back-up pair. Also planning on buying some for my family members whom I hear grinding in their rooms at night. Tooth grinding is a very serious issue and this product is such a life saver!</li>
    <li> this product is too big for my mouth and is very hard to sleep with it in my mouth i will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I read many reviews on this product before I purchased it.  I was very optimistic.  I tried 2 different settings and I suppose my mouth size is somewhere in between 2 settings because one was too big, the other too small.  The mouthguard would not stay over my bottom front teeth and kept riding up to where I could chew on it with my front teeth if I wasn&#x27;t careful.  The seller (SIMPLY POSITIVE SUPPLEMENTS ) did not offer a return on this product.  Perhaps I should have purchased at my local drug store.  They probably would have taken it back.</li>
    <li> Sleepright is the product I have been looking for, it works very well.  Takes a few nights to get used to but when adjusted for your mouth, can be very comfortable.</li>
    <li> My dentist recco&#x27;d getting a nightguard and said try the ones at pharmacy before speind $$$ on a custom one.  I tried this and it took 2-3 nights to get used to but it seems to work now.  Keep in mind you have to adjust it to fit and then wear it to make sure you have adjusted it correctly...so it may take a few days to get it right.  For me, Its comfortable and it is working - my jaw is not sore when I wake up...a good product. It was onsale for about $30 but I know the reg price is about $40.  That is a good deal.</li>
    <li> It does the job just fine for my needs. Some other guards I tried made me feel like I was preparing for a boxing match before bed and were very uncomfortable, this one is very nice to sleep with in your mouth. No soar gums or sensitive teeth in the morning, and I&#x27;m sure the wife likes not hearing my grinding teeth anymore. Not a bad product at all, the only things I would like is some kind of cleaning rinse solution to leave it in before the next use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know whether this is me or else but as said I cannot keep this in site and therefore use it, the taste of it is also disappointing</li>
    <li> Again - not for people with an overbite.  Too thick between the back teeth causing a headache.</li>
    <li> The picture on website advertised as 7x but received 3x.  Product itself works fine as have owned and used before.  Whole package was crushed but that was the mighty USPS&#x27; doing.</li>
    <li> This product does not work.  You look like a football player with it in your mouth &amp; it is very uncomfortable.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on it.  I went to my dentist &amp; had one custom made for me.  It was $95 &amp; well worth it, fits me perfect.</li>
    <li> Lasted for a year. I can bite through 6 inch steel cable in my sleep and this guard stood up strong the whole year. Threw it away for sanitation more than wear and tear.</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth and have found this to be bulky and uncomfortable - even when adjusted to the smallest size. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best night guard I&#x27;ve used. For me, it&#x27;s much better than the boil-and-bite models. After a few nights, this nightguard isn&#x27;t noticeable at all. Also, it has never fallen out, which has been a major problem with other models I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> This guard help me to sleep right and foget about theet grits,  so easy to order and comes with a protector to store when its not in use.</li>
    <li> I use a dental guard at night to keep from grinding my teeth. It helps me sleep deeper to I think.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 4 of these since the first of the year.&lt;br /&gt;yes they work, but then they break in the middle. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me or what.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be ordering any more.</li>
    <li> made me bite down more, bit through it the first week. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried devices you boil, and have even had custom made by my dentist.  With all of them, I&#x27;ve had the same problem:  they all cause me to gag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an overbite, and the boil and bite devices become deformed and don&#x27;t fit well.  They also push up to high between my cheeks and gums causing discomfort.  Plus they push on my hard palette causing me to gag. Finally, they push my jaw out of whack and can trigger TMJ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Doesn&#x27;t cause gag reflex. All parts are between or in front of teeth.  Nothing touches your tongue or palette.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Easy to adjust.  Fits any size mouth with easy slide adjustable strap.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Easy to clean.  Rinse off with cold water after removal.  I like to soak mine in mouthwash - it makes it taste minty.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Durable - I get more than 6 months out of the Dura model.  I only got a month out of the Slim before I bit through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Expensive compared to the very simple boil and bite devices, but a lot cheaper than a custom device.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The side guards may take some getting used to for some.  My overbite pulls the side guard up against my gums on one side and causes discomfort.  After a couple days use, the discomfort goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that grinds their teeth.</li>
    <li> I used this for over a week and it was somewhat uncomfortable. I would rather have a form fitting mouth guard. I woke up in the morning and my front teeth were sore and they were never sore before, so I don&#x27;t think this product was for me, which is too bad because a lot of other people seemed to have luck using it.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different mouth guards but still woke up with jaw pain. I decided to give this guard a shot because it was more rigid and it is working really well. It can be a bit bulky if it is not seated properly but a quick adjust puts it back in place. I also like it is adjustable. If I could change anything, it would be to make the plates even harder for those nights I really grind. Overall, very satisfied and would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This guard slips around at night and my bf has chewed into the front part of it so it&#x27;s breaking apart in the middle.  I don&#x27;t think he will be able to use it much longer because it might split in half soon.</li>
    <li> It probably does what it is supposed to, but I couldn&#x27;t sleep well because of it and my jaw hurt worse in the morning after using it.&lt;br /&gt;It just didn&#x27;t work for me - probably works fine for others.</li>
    <li> THIS HAS HELPED ME SO MUCH I AM GLAD I FOUND IT . IT IS EASY TO WEAR  POP IT IN AND POP IT OUT WHEN YOU A UP</li>
    <li> I have paid far more for a less superior product.  If you&#x27;re a \\&quot;serious\\&quot; teeth grinder this is the best for the money.</li>
    <li> The price was right to try this out, but the sides were too tall for my mouth. They left my gums feeling sore and bruised and I couldn&#x27;t wear it the next night. I&#x27;m female, with what I&#x27;d guess is an average mouth size. My husband also tried one of these, but after a friend said that their dentist-made mouth guard has lasted many years, he decided to go that route. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, but if you want to try it, females (at least) should go for the low profile version.</li>
    <li> The description on the box says it will work with braces. It does not. The bite guards are too far off the rear teeth to give a full bite to. Only about 3/4 - 1/2 of my bite guards fit between the rear teeth. The front band that holds the guard in place to extremely this and flimsy and doesn&#x27;t hold the sides in place, so it all falls out and ends up on my pillow. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t swallow this thing.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for about 5 years...since diagnosed with TMJ.  Did not want to buy the expensive appliance from the dentist. This appliance is fully adjustable to fit any size mouth and it can be used on upper or lower teeth.  I used it on lower teeth until I started using a bi-pap and the face mask interfered with this appliance.  Moved it to upper teeth and it still works great.  I go to a chiropractor regularly to have re-alignments including my jaws for the TMJ and my chiropractor said the appliance is holding my jaws in the correct place and since using it there is less adjustments needed.  One of the best products I have used!!  I will not go without it.</li>
    <li> Basically a football/ sparring mouth guard- boil, bite, boom done.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap enough and gets the job done- my gf doesn&#x27;t hit me anymore from grinding my teefs, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t grind my teeth as much as I clench them while I sleep (yay for stress). Clenching has been wreaking havoc on my teeth and even my crowns, a few of which I have had to replace from busting them over time, so I needed to do something as all the dental work was getting expensive...and annoying. I still clench my teeth at night when I wear this, but it helps me so I don&#x27;t wake up with a sore jaw or ruined teeth/dental work. You may notice your teeth feel a little sensitive at first when you wake up, but it goes away pretty quickly and honestly I don&#x27;t think this happens to everyone. Most people who clench or grind will stop once they begin to wear this. My stress just tends to get the best of me even while asleep.</li>
    <li> did not work, does not stay in.  After trying 30+ mouth guards over the years, I bit the bullet and went to the dentist.  With insurance it cost me $27- SO WORTH IT!!!!  Go to the dentist and get the right thing</li>
    <li> This did not feel comfortable in my mouth. It was easy enough to adjust and it may be that mouth needs to be &amp;#34;specially&amp;#34; fitted. Either way this mouth guard made me feel like it was some sort of acient torture device. :)</li>
    <li> I have used trays made at the dentist, ones bought online and never liked any of them as well as I do this one. Trays are too bulky and tend to make me drool on the pillow. When I got this and opened the box my first thought was it would never work. I was pleasantly surprised after the very first night! You barely know it is there. It works great at keeping my teeth separated so they do not grind. The material that gets bitten down on is firm and should last a long time. Plus, it does have a one year durability guarantee. Best part: no wet pillow! It is adjustable, but I had no need to sleep in it first to adjust it. Just adjust it to a comfortable bite and you have it set. I recommend this above ANY boil-to-fit guards out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE: This little wonder is still going strong! Some discoloration, but I simply rinse it off every morning and soak it in a peroxide/mouthwash mix once a week for a thorough cleaning. When (or if) it ever wears out, I will replace it with the same thing.</li>
    <li> So much relief already! My jaw isnt bothering me as much as it was before.</li>
    <li> I got this mouth guard after my dentist told me I grind my teeth and suggested I get one to prevent further damage. I liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t have to be boiled and had the bite pads. However, I have a narrow mouth and the guard fits awkwardly. I can barely talk and on more that one night it has kept me from getting to sleep. The guard has also caused my gums to bleed and some of my teeth to shift. All my issues come down to the fit really so if you can find one that&#x27;s the right size this can be a really good mouth guard.</li>
    <li> I am a night clincher and this product Works good. I like how you get 2 different types of guards. One is a softer guard and they have a minty taste</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this night guard for about 5 months now. I had tried the boil and bite for a few wks, but it was very uncomfortable and actually starting hurting my gums so I stopped wearing it. Then my dentist insisted that I had to wear a night guard (I&#x27;ve cracked two teeth) and so I tried this one and it has worked very well for me. It has held up well. is comfortable enough for me and still allows me some ability to speak. If the boil and bite has not worked for you, this one is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I really love it! I hate night guards. I was wearing an upper one and a lower one that my dentist made. They were expensive and I would grind through them, which ripped through the hard plastic shell. The hard plastic shell would then  be jagged and cut my mouth. And it got gross, yuck! The sleep right  guard  fits, it is holding up well, I only have to wear one, and it is minty fresh and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This was my 3rd or 4th attempt at a mouth guard on amazon, bit pricier than the others I&#x27;d tried but UGGGGH sometimes you do get what you pay for. I&#x27;d tried ones with less plastic and ones with more, none of which stayed in my mouth all night or was anywhere near as comfortable</li>
    <li> The additional flap irritated my gums after just 3 nights so much that I could not wear it anymore.  I had to get another made from my dentist and it is so much better. Parent company would not take back as I had exceeded the 30 days. I am not happy and out $30.</li>
    <li> I am a clencher with a long history of morning headaches. This has worked the best for me, and I have had 4 custom nightguards made before I tried this. Reduced my headaches by 80%. Takes getting used to, you have to give it 3 nights to not notice it. I trimmed the wings. I think it could be a little less pliable and still work well. I did think it was an odd device when I first received it. I have had my latest one for 6 months. Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I suffered with TMJ for years. I tried the chiropractor, I tried mouth guard after mouth guard (and grinded through them), I tried muscle relaxers and pain relievers.  I suffered with migraines from the TMJ. I paid way too much for a professionally made mouth guard from the dentist, and grinded through it within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouth guard has been the ONLY thing that has ever stopped my TMJ problems.  I even find myself waking with my mouth open now, where before my jaw muscles were permanently clenched upon waking.  If you have a smaller mouth, the small one works perfect.  It is barely noticeable in your mouth and easy to talk while it is in.  Make sure you do the phrases and repeat them at night after you put the mouth guard in.  It takes a few days, but the guard along with the training of your brain really make this product work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very soft flexible pad on each side of the guard.</li>
    <li> This dental guard is a tremendous help to me, a person who grinds her teeth at night and has done so for many years.  It fits well and keeps me from grinding my teeth down to a nub.  Much better than the one my dentist made for me, which cost ten times as much.</li>
    <li> This thing works pretty well once you&#x27;re used to it. I really liked the mint flavor, but it kind of wears out after a week. The only thing is depending on how you grind or how you lay at night it may end up bending as it is pretty flimsy on the connecting pieces although the part between your teeth is pretty solid. I&#x27;ve kind of stopped wearing mine because I wake up with my teeth out of line because it sets your jaw in alignment, but if your teeth are shifted even a little, like mine, it can leave you waking up with your bite feeling off for the first half of your day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you absolutely must stop your grinding I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product, but as for me, I grind only every once in a while,not every night.</li>
    <li> I have been using the sleep right night guard for two years now. I find them the most comfortable out of all the ones I have tried. They are the only night guard that I have tried that I have been able to sleep with. My last one I had for a year before I had to throw it away. They also fit my teeth right of the box. No more boiling night guards to get them to fit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but prefer Sleepright. It fits comfortably inside my mouth and doesn&#x27;t block my airway. The only thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s not as durable and has to be replaced every few months. I&#x27;m not a heavy grinder, but sometimes I grind my teeth when I sleep. I like that it&#x27;s not made of latex and is bpa free. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately much as I tried to persevere, this did not work for me, giving me sleepless nights. The band that goes around the lower gums was far too long with no way of adjusting it. If I adjusted the other part so it sat further at the back of my mouth then the positioning wasn&#x27;t correct as shown in the leaflet. I know I have a small mouth but I felt that there wasn&#x27;t enough attention drawn to the fact that those that do have small mouths should have the other version. Because of the hygiene issue  I felt it would not be fair to return it as it would no longer be saleable. I have given it two stars. one for the fact it probably does work fine for those with average or larger size mouths. Two, the silicone material did seem as if it would be comfortable should it have fitted. Because of the cost I feel I can&#x27;t risk buying/wasting money for the smaller one.</li>
    <li> I would reccommend this to anyone who grinds their teeth at night. This mouth piece lasts so much longer than anything else I&#x27;ve used and it keeps my jaw from hurting in the morning.</li>
    <li> I bought this back in 2011 and I still have it. It&#x27;s a bit worn down (I grind)&lt;br /&gt;so I should be replacing it soon. Going to buy this brand again, just going to&lt;br /&gt;see if I can find it for less.</li>
    <li> If you want to avoid waking up each morning without headaches this is exactly what you need. I saw a huge difference the very first night.</li>
    <li> if you have very strong bruxism you may chew right through this within 2 months like I did. it is rather flimsy but it WORKS. I chose it because it was BPA-free. This is only for you if you are okay with replacing it every 2-6 months, depending on how bad your bruxism is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other mouth guards -- those ones where you BOIL them to fit your mouth never last.  I got my first Sleep Right guard about SIX years ago, and used it every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it finally fell apart, my only choice was to replace it.  No other guards even entered into the equation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY COMPLAINT:  The side guards are a little too high for my mouth -- it&#x27;s kinda uncomfortable.  I noticed that others have had this same problem too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, you pay a little extra for this one -- but take into account how much LONGER it lasts than the other makes, and think of all the future dental bills you won&#x27;t be getting.</li>
    <li> Works great! Easy to use, clean, and maintain. I sleep so much better with this. No more headaches upon waking up, since I started using it. Even my wife felt the difference as I didn&#x27;t wake her up in the middle of night with my teeth biting.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Sealed in packaging upon arrival. Exactly like the more expensive one sold in stores. Shipped on time/arrived on time. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The guard didn&#x27;t fit well because it was huge, if you are over 7 feet never mind. The real reason why I am writing this review is different. Sleep Right is supposed to have a sort of warranty in which if the product doesn&#x27;t work out, you can just email it back along with the receipt and get a refund. Great idea! they now have my guard, my receipt, and my money! Good luck in calling customer service, I don&#x27;t know why they have that policy if they have no intent on following it. Had I known this I would have just cut the loss short and not bothered mailing them back that useless product.</li>
    <li> I have tmj and must use night guards so I won&#x27;t chip my front teeth. My other one is very bulky and big in front. I can hardly close my mouth so I tried this one. I initially likes it because there&#x27;s nothing in front, until I woke up. Because it doesn&#x27;t actually fit in place I found I had to kind of suction it in place. When I woke I had the side screw adjustment things  painfully imprinted in my checks. I can not use this, way too painful.</li>
    <li> The night guard, becomes yellow, brittle, and the material hard (I do not smoke). It is easy to use. It works, but designed for short life.</li>
    <li> This product is brilliant. I have had a clicking jaw for over 30 years and it seems to have corrected this and the alignment of my jaws. I used to have a regular bite plate which put pressure on my other teeth and, since using this Dura Comfort Guard, my front teeth don&#x27;t appear so crooked.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is my third time purchasing this mouth guard within 1 month&lt;br /&gt;I had original got it from a corner store that had it on sale, It worked perfectly for a week until my dog got ahold of it, after that week I went out and bought another one, this one got thrown away by a big mistake, now that it&#x27;s off-sale, amazon has it just for a little cheaper :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; the NO BOIL type fit is absolutely superior over any other model, it fits and cradles my jaw so well I had no other choice but to keep buying this type of nightguard,&lt;br /&gt;my jaw feels so punished and abused once I place my mouthpiece in my mouth, I can finally go to bed without a headache&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthguard is the one to get, I&#x27;ve had too many boil types that don&#x27;t work well to spend my money on anything else&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 6&#x27;5 and my mouth is huge! this mouthpiece is large enough to fit me,&lt;br /&gt;I could imagine, if youre a smaller person, the sides of the guard being ruff on gums, but I don&#x27;t have that problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s help a lot for my TMJ disorder. It feels good to wear it before I fell asleep. But every morning I took it off, my tooth ache. I know its inevitable but just let you guys know what it feel. It just save my life.</li>
    <li> This device has helped. E out with headaches and bad sleep due to grinding my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This one is good, but kind of harder than the one I got from a store (it was cheaper too)</li>
    <li> This is too large for my mouth even with the adjustment capability. I used the small guard before, but apparently it is no longer manufactured. This is causing sores and pressure on the cheek area of my mouth.</li>
    <li> Best Dental Guard! I have used a few other brands and I chewed right through them. This one is small in your mouth and very durable. Have been using for a long time and it&#x27;s still holding up. Just store it in mouthwash to keep the plaque off.</li>
    <li> I inherited grinding my teeth at night from my Dad.  It has always plagued him and now me.  I have tried many different solutions, but this is the first and last time I will need to find something that works as well.  And it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend to help with her nightly teeth grinding problem. I read a lot of reviews and wanted to avoid the boil and fit mouth guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried this in hopes it would be a great alterantive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like everything this thing was designed to help fit your mouth perfectly....is exactly was prevented it from fitting well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tabs on the side were uncomfortable. The adjustable bite guards never quite sat well in her mouth. The movement guard that goes over your bottom gum moved around a lot and was very uncomfortable for her. She tried sleeping with it and twice she woke up in the middle of the night with it either out of place or just completely outside her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; taste that she couldn&#x27;t get rid of. We tried washing it. Soaking it in both water then mouth wash. Nothing would take that taste away. I&#x27;m sure over time it might go away....but during that time, she would have had a very uncomfotable device in her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We eventaully gave up and went with a cheap boil and fit sleep guard. It&#x27;s worked great so far. With none of the issues I stated above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...this Sleep Right guard just wasn&#x27;t for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemed like a nice alternative in theory.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several full mouth guards but decided to try this based on reviews.  Not sure why they are so good.  It fits loosely in my mouth with the side guards rubbing against my inner cheek.  It has fallen out several times overnight, and usually I wake up then take it out because it&#x27;s bothersome.  Can&#x27;t recommend...but maybe it works for some mouth shapes.</li>
    <li> Low cost alternative to custom guards. Super durable and easy to use. I am able to sleep with these without feeling like I have a ton of plastic in my mouth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through three of these now, and found them to be extremely comfortable to sleep.  Unfortunately, the pads tend to split in half right after the 3 month mark.  There really isn&#x27;t any reason they couldn&#x27;t manufacturer these to last longer, other than to force people to keep buying replacements.  I did just that for three sets but cannot afford to keep doing so every few months.  If you don&#x27;t bite down very hard or often, this product may be a great fit for you.</li>
    <li> Works great, I bought this for my wife and it helps her to get asleep without grinding teeth and she has  stopped waking up with a pain in her jaw the next morning.</li>
    <li> I had braces put on 1.5 years ago so I had to give up the custom bite block from my dentist.  The Dura Comfort has many issues that do no plague a professional bite block.  The dura takes up a lot of real estate, leaves my mouth open so I wake up either with a dry tongue or drooling.  It partially occludes your airway.  It rubs against your cheeks.  Over time, they get calcified and gross.  Yeah, did not like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a few months, kind of like my braces, I did get used to all these things.  They do work as advertised.  As a bonus, I&#x27;ve owned these for well over a year, even though they are supposed to last just 6 months, and I bite down pretty hard!  there is a small crack that popped up in the left bite block at around 3 months but has not grown larger, no other issues.  Judging by the durability, I will probably get at least 2 years use out of this thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way this product will work for everyone.  I would say if you have sleep apnea, a tiny mouth, or gag easily, look at other products.  If not, it is worth &amp;#60;$40 bucks to give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I bought this guard to help control my need to grind my teeth while sleeping. It has helped a lot ... my teeth don&#x27;t ache in the morning and I&#x27;ve stopped waking up with a headache.</li>
    <li> I ordered this night guard to use while I was waiting for a new custom-fit one.  It is very uncomfortable in the mouth - the sides actually made the insides of my cheeks raw and sore; the little piece of plastic that goes across your lower teeth is annoying at night.  You have to clench your teeth together to keep it in place. Not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Lets my jaw stay relaxed. Works better than my $200 custom night guard. Keeps me from grinding. Anybody who is looking at an expensive night guard, try this first!</li>
    <li> According to my dentist I clench very hard and am destroying my molars. I had a dentist-made bite guard a few years ago (horseshoe shaped design made of hard/rigid material), but after braces to correct alignment of front teeth, that very costly one no longer fits. I can wear this guard with my retainers. It is not very comfortable -- it has hinged sides that push between your gums and the insides of you cheeks/lips -- but it is not so bad that I would remove it in my sleep. The bite surfaces are soft and spongy, which I liked. I used it every night for about a month, but I have now bitten through one side completely and the other side almost. I might buy this again despite the discomfort, but I am going to try another design first.  I bought this one at a local store, but am shopping on Amazon for a replacement. Prices are about the same, and I don&#x27;t have to stoop to the bottom shelf to examine the merchandise!</li>
    <li> This was my first dental guard. It is adjustable. Although it took me a while to find the best setting. It felt very uncomfortable in the beginning but I kept trying to get used to it. I could feel that my jaws were being trained to relax. I also liked the material it is made of. However, there is either something wrong with its design or I should have tried a different model. The biggest issue was that the side wings were rubbing my gums around the gap between the two parts of the side wings. I had to stop using the guards for a few days, treat my gums with a gel that&#x27;s usually used by people who wear dentures to heal gums. I kept trying a few times until my husband decided to fix it with boiling water and spoiled it completely. Regardless, I wouldn&#x27;t be using it anyway. One of the reviewers for this product had mentioned same problem that I have had. I think it does not suit people with sensitive gums and, possibly, smaller jaw(?) size.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Secure-Comfort version before and thought I&#x27;d try this Dura-Comfort since the bite pads are supposed to be more durable. Well, the wing things that protrude up irritated my gums. so i took some sharp scissors and trimmed those things off to be the same height as the Slim-Comfort. So I&#x27;ve got a Slim-Comfort guard with more durable bite pads that doesn&#x27;t dig into my gums. I think that even if I have to buy another set, I&#x27;ll repeat that modification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My take on this is that if you grind your teeth at night, then your mouth is very closed, so there&#x27;s little chance that the guard is going to fall through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love the price on here. way more manageable.</li>
    <li> I grind at night and it sucks.  I&#x27;ve worn guards for years and finally chewed through one that my dentist made me 7 or so years ago (that one was awesome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d tried the boil and bite guards and chew through those in a matter of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I invested in this.  It says not to use if you have TMJ.  I do.  But since I grind, I need something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable; I have a relatively small bite, I think. And perfect teeth, which may or may not be important information.  I know people have different bites and teeth so maybe this is a good product for people with a relatively small bite and perfect teeth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not chewed through it yet and have been using it since August 2012. And somehow shoves my jaw forward and I think that factor lessens the grinding. (Which apparently happens, per my dentist, because my jaw is out-of-place but when pushed forward it is in the position where it does not grind or at least not as much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is relaxing my jaw a little and this is much needed.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative the professionally fit bit blocks that are made at the dentists office.  While not as comfortable at first, it definitely does the job.  It took a few nights to get the fit right but now that I have it figured out it is very easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE TRIED THE LOW PROFILE SLEEP RIGHT BEFORE THAT WAS BETTER THAN THIS PRODUCT HOWEVER THAT ONLY LASTED ME ABOUT A MONTH. SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY THIS ONE AS IT&#x27;S SUPPOSED TO LAST FOR 6MTHS. LIKE OTHER COMPLAINTS THE SIDES ARE TOO TALL. I CANNOT CLOSE MY MOUTH AND WAKE UP WITH A DRY PARROT TONGUE. I FIND MYSELF CLENCHING HARDER JUST TO TRY AND KEEP MY MOUTH CLOSED. I&#x27;VE BEEN GETTING JAW ACHES AND TENSION. ALSO I FIND MYSELF WEARING IT UPSIDE DOWN AS THE BAR PUSHES MY BOTTOM LIP OPEN. OH WHAT TO DO?</li>
    <li> Have been using this dental guard for years and like it very much. My source was not carrying it but I went on Amazon and there it was.</li>
    <li> well made and super tuff, i grind my teeth all night is what i&#x27;ve been told and this guard is well worth the money</li>
    <li> I clench in my sleep (and in the daytime too) but The SleepRight is working for me so far at night. I notice a little mushy feeling in my cheek in the a.m. - I think where the guard is resting against  skin?? IDK.... but it has stayed in place just fine and is doing the job! Much more comfortable than the last guard I had.</li>
    <li> Sucked. Could not fall asleep w this and when I did it was always under me/my pillow/falling out. Don&#x27;t get this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m returning this dental guard. I had been using it at night for only about a week when I noticed my front top teeth were pointing inwards towards my mouth! I couldn&#x27;t close my jaw properly. It was disturbing. Luckily a few nights of not using it seems to have let my mouth readjust to its usual self. Even aside from the terrifying insight that my teeth were wandering, I found the edges of the guard too high. They rubbed too much into my cheeks and were causing problems with the skin there.</li>
    <li> Fits comfortably, doesn&#x27;t fall out, and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I&#x27;m as happy as someone can be with a mouthguard.</li>
    <li> It stretches during the night and falls out sometimes.  My mouth dries out from staying slightly open.  I try to keep my lips touching as instructed, but that is hard to do when your are sleeping.  With all this said, it is constructed better than all the other guards that fit over all the teeth.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthguard. The dentist made an expensive one for me that made my clenching even worse. This is the only product that has helped. It arrived promptly. It was made well and easy to use. My teeth and jaws are happy!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend a crazy amount of money for a custom one from the dentist and don&#x27;t buy one of the guards that requires boiling!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great guard to keep you from grinding your teeth at night, is very sturdy and well made, and really puts the other more expensive guards to shame.  None last forever, but I get about 8-12 months out of one of these.</li>
    <li> Way to small to wear while sleeping unless you want to choke to death on it.  The blades on the side are tiny.  I had to order the other kind with the bigger blades.</li>
    <li> Better than products that do that do not have long enough bite plate, the full bite area is covered. Good material.</li>
    <li> I wish I had paid more attention to the negative reviews before purchasing this nightguard. Like others have reported, it moved my teeth--not only did it do nothing for my pain from clenching, but now I have an open bite (none of my teeth touch any more, except the four back molars which didn&#x27;t make contact with the nightguard). Now I have to undergo extremely costly, painful, and lengthy orthodontic treatment to try to correct the damage. (The model the orthodontist made of my teeth shows a clear gap in the spaces where the two rubber planes fit when I wore the mouthguard.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d advise others to avoid this nightguard at all costs. I wish I had never used it.</li>
    <li> This is a great night guard! After using it, my jaw doesn&#x27;t hurt in the morning and my wife says that my snoring has gone down significantly. I got this to protect my jaws and not as a snore-guard. Also the adjustable side is a great design and feature! Kudos to Sleepright Dura Comfort! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this night guard to use while I was saving to have my dentist create a new replacement custom guard for me.  This product is pretty good for the price. I found it much more comfortable than the ones that must be boiled. It stayed in place as I slept. It&#x27;s easy to clean. It prevented my teeth from grinding against each other. Overall, I was initially very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I had to discontinue use after less than a month due to the uneven pressure from the bite guards causing the teeth directly in front of the bite guards to shift. I would wake with sore teeth and a bite that wouldn&#x27;t correctly align. Generally by the end of the day my bite would seem to work itself back into place, but I worried about long term effects so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I love this. I can get the level of sleep I deserve. I recommend this product for anyone seeking a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> I started having TMJ while training for a marathon this past summer and my chiropractor suggested this product. It has helped me and it is not bulky.  My chiropractor said this was all I needed and did not need an expensive mouth piece made at the dentist office. I recommend it if you have TMJ and sleep with it every night. I also heard that if I wear it while I run it might just help me with my running!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father.&lt;br /&gt;He says it works for him: easy to use and quite comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It helps protecting his teeth: he still grins in his sleep but no harm caused any more.</li>
    <li> Loves it for a long time, now at about the 10 month mark I noticed my teeth have shift, now I&#x27;m looking at a VERY costly correction with my orthodontist, honestly I would just get one from your doctor, pay 400 up front or thousands in the long run...</li>
    <li> I liked this one for a long time but every 4-5 months (with the DURA) I would be getting through them and they are little more expensive than some of the other models. If you don&#x27;t clench or grind hard these will probably last quite a while, but if you are prone to getting through these you may want a different model.</li>
    <li> I bought the same product 2 years ago and it worked great.  This time I can&#x27;t get it to fit comfortably without wrapping it in saran wrap.  A total disappointment.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> No more sore teeth when I wake. Fits comfortably.</li>
