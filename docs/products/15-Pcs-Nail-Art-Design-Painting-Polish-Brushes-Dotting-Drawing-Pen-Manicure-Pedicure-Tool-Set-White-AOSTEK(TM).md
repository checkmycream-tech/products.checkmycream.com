      <li>I love these brushes a good investment for the price</li>
      <li>but they were very cheap.  </li>
      <li>This nail art striping brush set is very good quality and arrived early.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got these brushes I was gonna use them for nail</li>
      <li>Our Estheticians are using them in their manicures and pedicures and love them.  </li>
      <li>I love the brushes in this set.</li>
      <li>i love them</li>
      <li>but they are all phenomenal.</li>
      <li>I have already had to trim some wild bristles on the striper brushes, but that made them thinner, which is a good thing!</li>
      <li>Just got these brushes in the mail, they came in pretty good time.</li>
      <li>Large variety of brush types for a good price.</li>
      <li>The bristles were nice but the brushes came right off the handles.</li>
      <li>Theses brushes are wonderful and come in a little storage case .</li>
      <li>Cheap brushes that fell apart</li>
      <li>Great price, did not take long to get here, knock on wood</li>
      <li>They were super cheap....</li>
      <li>Exactly as pictured, great quality and better than expected for the price.</li>
      <li>The brushes themselves appear to be in relative good quality, keeping in mind</li>
      <li>Super super fun to paint with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush set was exactly what we expected and they work great.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve made it a point to be extra careful with these brushes, and they&#x27;ve held up great!</li>
      <li>Other than that, this product was good for the price.</li>
      <li>She is a teen and love to do nail art</li>
      <li>but for the price they really can&#x27;t be beat!  </li>
      <li>Many different brush sizes and styles.</li>
      <li>To clean the brushes, I&#x27;ve been using pure acetone and so far haven&#x27;t noticed any falling apart from this.  </li>
      <li>There is a nice selection of brushes in this set to satisfy different needs, so if you are looking for a basic low end brush set, this will fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>and she cant live without them!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m considering ordering another set to use to brush mica on craft projects since I don&#x27;t require a high quality brush for that.</li>
      <li>I bought these brushes a few months ago to use for nail art, but I have ended up using them even more with acrylic painting.</li>
      <li>With normal nail art/painting use, these brushes should hold up for quite some time.</li>
      <li>I love how small the brush heads are and all the detail you can add with them.</li>
      <li>I used one of the biggest square brushes to paint for several hours on a pair of canvas shoes, and the brush bristles are now a little &amp;#34;frayed&amp;#34; for lack of a better word.</li>
      <li>But again, I spent $2, so there isn&#x27;t really too much</li>
      <li>The very bottom of the case (it was all plastic) was open, so the brushes have been trying to slide out.</li>
      <li>The only problem I had with them was if I tugged on the aluminum part too hard the brush would pull apart but that can be solved by gluing them on better.</li>
      <li>I completely understand why this happened as I was rubbing the brush back and forth vigorously on the canvas for quite some time, and that caused some of the bristles to spread out.</li>
      <li>Cat&#x27;s will wait till the most inconvienant time to mess up your entire day, like the other day my cat</li>

<li> But even so, shipping from China isn&#x27;t terrible as I have ordered other items from Amazon from China and it took just 2-3 weeks, earlier than the estimated time of arrival if I remember correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> Good price, nice looking brushes.</li>
    <li> They were super cheap....so I guess you get what you pay for.  The brushes are coming off already...the second I pulled of the plastic cover.  I used nail glue to put them back together.</li>
    <li> Best quality for the price. Many different brush sizes and styles. I may use a couple of them for makeup use if they hold up well, since not all of them would be great for nails. Large variety of brush types for a good price.</li>
    <li> Some of the bristles are not ok to use with acetone but they are all phenomenal.</li>
    <li> Theses brushes are wonderful and come in a little storage case . i love them thay are great with nail art.</li>
    <li> Very nice variety of nail brushes for a variety of tasks. Great price, did not take long to get here, knock on wood nothing has fallen apart yet.</li>
    <li> This nail art striping brush set is very good quality and arrived early. I especially like that it comes with brush tip sleeves to keep your brushes in shape and protected while not in use. Exactly as pictured, great quality and better than expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;ve bought worse but that doesn&#x27;t justify these being bent and the metal tip falling off the stick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I got these brushes I was gonna use them for nail but now I&#x27;m useing them to put on eyeliner I love these brushes a good investment for the price</li>
    <li> This brush set was exactly what we expected and they work great.  Can&#x27;t beat the quality for the money.  Our Estheticians are using them in their manicures and pedicures and love them.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Just got these brushes in the mail, they came in pretty good time. The brushes themselves appear to be in relative good quality, keeping in mind I spent only $2 on these things. The only thing I can say I dislike about the product is the case that the brushes come in. The very bottom of the case (it was all plastic) was open, so the brushes have been trying to slide out. But again, I spent $2, so there isn&#x27;t really too much I can say</li>
    <li> Cheap brushes that fell apart but they were very cheap.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> product was just at described I love the brushes in this set. They are just what I was hoping they would be.</li>
    <li> Perfect and functional, in good physical condition all the pizzas and good quality covers expectations, very good sales all well recommend</li>
    <li> The bristles were nice but the brushes came right off the handles.</li>
    <li> You know from the get-go these are not going to be the best brushes out there because they are so inexpensive. I just started doing nail art as a hobby and wanted a variety of brushes to try, so I could discover which ones I like or dislike using.  I have already had to trim some wild bristles on the striper brushes, but that made them thinner, which is a good thing! To clean the brushes, I&#x27;ve been using pure acetone and so far haven&#x27;t noticed any falling apart from this.  There is a nice selection of brushes in this set to satisfy different needs, so if you are looking for a basic low end brush set, this will fit the bill.</li>
    <li> I am using these in my pottery studio for detail work in painting under glaze. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Got these for my niece and she cant live without them! She is a teen and love to do nail art so a great gift indeed!</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t perfect - the bristles stick together a bit on some of them and the tops come off easily on some as well - but for the price they really can&#x27;t be beat!  I use these for nails but I&#x27;m considering ordering another set to use to brush mica on craft projects since I don&#x27;t require a high quality brush for that.</li>
    <li> good set. just dont let your nail polish remover touch the white because the paint comes off easliy</li>
    <li> These brushes are so inexpensive so I had to try them. The only problem I had with them was if I tugged on the aluminum part too hard the brush would pull apart but that can be solved by gluing them on better. Other than that, this product was good for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes a few months ago to use for nail art, but I have ended up using them even more with acrylic painting. I love how small the brush heads are and all the detail you can add with them. Super super fun to paint with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve made it a point to be extra careful with these brushes, and they&#x27;ve held up great! I used one of the biggest square brushes to paint for several hours on a pair of canvas shoes, and the brush bristles are now a little &amp;#34;frayed&amp;#34; for lack of a better word. I completely understand why this happened as I was rubbing the brush back and forth vigorously on the canvas for quite some time, and that caused some of the bristles to spread out. I don&#x27;t blame this on the quality of the brush at all but rather on the abuse/normal wear and tear that I gave the brush while I was painting. With normal nail art/painting use, these brushes should hold up for quite some time. For what this brush set costs, I will probably just buy another set to replace the one brush. But there&#x27;s enough of that type of brush I can do without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I paid a little extra to have these brushes shipped from California, so shipping was quicker than from China. But even so, shipping from China isn&#x27;t terrible as I have ordered other items from Amazon from China and it took just 2-3 weeks, earlier than the estimated time of arrival if I remember correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it all up, I highly highly recommend these brushes to anyone looking for a set of small brushes, whether for nail art or for acrylic painting! You get much more than you pay for with these brushes! Great, great product. Highly recommend!</li>
