      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>The perfume smells lovely.</li>
      <li>okay,</li>
      <li>but I would have paid more for more Nag Champa.</li>
      <li>If you love nag champa and are looking for a scent to use on yourself and not just insense I recommend this.</li>
      <li>I gave one to my daughter and granddaughter, the love it.</li>
      <li>This smells more like baby powder than nag champa.</li>
      <li>and I was glad to find Nag Champa scent</li>
      <li>I think it would be ok, for a dab on a wrist,</li>
      <li>This has to be my favorite smell in the world.  </li>
      <li>I received it quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the little pot it comes in is just perfect.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The rosewood jar is nice and the carving is pretty.</li>
      <li>this is a fine substitute.</li>
      <li>The scent is softer than the pure oil, but is still nice.</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful, it reminds me of hippies and incense and a little spicy.</li>
      <li>The scent is an earthy scent with overtones of vanilla and a light floral background.  </li>
      <li>I havn&#x27;t used the solids for myself but got this as a present and it was great.</li>
      <li>also the container is very nice and matches my asian decor in my bath...</li>
      <li>This solid perfume is excellent and has the classic nag champa smell.</li>
      <li>The carved jar is very presentable and she was able to have a perfume in her purse that wouldn&#x27;t spill.</li>
      <li>Just the right size to fit in my purse</li>
      <li>May even smell a bit strong if you are unfamiliar with this scent when you first put it on.</li>
      <li>Love the smell of it and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>the transaction was fast and easy ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty, though!</li>
      <li>I liked the idea of a solid pefume</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s in a cute wooden Jar and perfect as a small gift for a tree hugging friend!</li>
      <li>The top kept coming loose and it did&#x27;t have much of a strong fragrance.  </li>
      <li>; shipping was super fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a solid perfume, which means pretty much smell dissolved in fat, so you rub this lip-balm consistency stuff that smells amazing on your wrists, neck, wherever.</li>
      <li>EXACTLY what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>love the fragrance and the adorable container but way way too small.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely purchase more items from this seller.</li>
      <li>The wooden jar it comes in is cute, I like how earthy it is.</li>
      <li>but this was very light and didn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
      <li>The little wooden jar is very cute and can easily fit in a handbag.</li>
      <li>The wooden jar is super cute, but as soon as I opened the package the perfume fell out of the middle.</li>
      <li>thanks for the fast service....C</li>
      <li>but the scent in general is way too mild for my taste.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for anyone trying to get away from the normal perfumes!</li>
      <li>Makes me remember all the solid scents available back then packaged 3 related scents in compacts, which would be more convenient for handbags.</li>
      <li>well I now have a new signature fragrance...</li>
      <li>Careful buying solid perfume or any perfume from any place other than the original manufacturer or a reputable retailer.  </li>
      <li>I love nag champa incense and this little baby brings me back to the seventies.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like Nag Champa and the perfume is orange all around the edge like it&#x27;s old.</li>
      <li>All I can say is WOW..</li>
      <li>I had such high hopes for this perfume.</li>
      <li>This product carries the true scent of nag champa but the aroma doesn&#x27;t last long when applied from this solid.</li>
      <li>I really like it so far and plan on buying other scents for me as well.</li>
      <li>The little wooden jar is cool but the scent is not Nag Champa.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s tiny little bottle is pretty, but couldn&#x27;t get it&#x27;s scent out in either!</li>

<li> I would have returned it but for what I paid for it I would still be out money less shipping</li>
<li> It is not messy and you can keep it in your purse for casual use.</li>
<li> Subtle scent.</li>

    <li> I absolutely love it!!! The little wooden jar is very cute and can easily fit in a handbag. The perfume smells lovely. I wish I could find Sandalwood in a similar wooden jar! This would make a very nice gift.</li>
    <li> This scent soothes the soul and is not cloying LOVE this stuff! The little solid perfume sits on my desk for little vacations from my day.</li>
    <li> This product carries the true scent of nag champa but the aroma doesn&#x27;t last long when applied from this solid. I have to layer it with oil.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.  A little bit goes a long way, so be careful on how much you use.</li>
    <li> Song of India is pretty hard to track down but I love their scents. I havn&#x27;t used the solids for myself but got this as a present and it was great.

    <li> love the fragrance and the adorable container but way way too small.  Priced okay, but I would have paid more for more Nag Champa.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume, but the wooden jar is a bit difficult to screw together.  It&#x27;s really pretty, though!</li>
    <li> May even smell a bit strong if you are unfamiliar with this scent when you first put it on. It&#x27;s small but a little goes a long way don&#x27;t let it dry out!!</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this perfume. The rosewood jar is nice and the carving is pretty. The problem is with the &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like Nag Champa and the perfume is orange all around the edge like it&#x27;s old.</li>
    <li> Ordered 1 for myself. Loved this perfume! Bought another for a friend. Different scent on each of us. But still was nice on each of us. Easy to apply. Subtle scent.</li>
    <li> Wish this came in a larger size! But it&#x27;s in a cute wooden Jar and perfect as a small gift for a tree hugging friend!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, and the wooden container is lovely.  I had no problems at all opening and closing it.  It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I was so happy with this fragrance, that I ordered another jar!  Just a couple dabs of this solid perfume on the skin, and you&#x27;ll carry this wonderful fragrance with you into any room you enter.</li>
    <li> Bought this to put in a closet or in my car to &#x27;smell&#x27; it up of Nag Champa. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s tiny little bottle is pretty, but couldn&#x27;t get it&#x27;s scent out in either! I didn&#x27;t notice it a bit in either my closet, or my car, that &#x27;roasts&#x27; in FL weather. I think it would be ok, for a dab on a wrist, maybe- but the scent in general is way too mild for my taste.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the little pot it comes in is just perfect.  I gave one to my daughter and granddaughter, the love it.</li>
    <li> This solid perfume is excellent and has the classic nag champa smell. If you love nag champa and are looking for a scent to use on yourself and not just insense I recommend this. It is not messy and you can keep it in your purse for casual use.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Smells soooooo good!!!  I love it!</li>
    <li> WAS ORDERED FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT AND SHE LOVED THIS AND WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN WHEN SHE NEEDS MORE, SHE WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY what I was looking for.  This has to be my favorite smell in the world.  The wood jar is beautiful too!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my yoga loving sister, but now I&amp;#34;ll be buying some for myself. I received it quickly and nicely packaged. The smell is wonderful, it reminds me of hippies and incense and a little spicy. Even after i wrapped it i can still smell it through the paper so i think the smell will last a long time. Since its a present i cant comment on its consistency or wear longevity. The wooden jar it comes in is cute, I like how earthy it is. I really like it so far and plan on buying other scents for me as well. I&#x27;d recommend Song Of India solid perfumes to others.</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of a solid pefume and I was glad to find Nag Champa scent but this was very light and didn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be a bigger container however it was very small.  The top kept coming loose and it did&#x27;t have much of a strong fragrance.  It&#x27;s okay if you like suttle however I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> In all its forms. When you tire of incense, or can&#x27;t burn it (say, at work) this is a fine substitute. It&#x27;s a solid perfume, which means pretty much smell dissolved in fat, so you rub this lip-balm consistency stuff that smells amazing on your wrists, neck, wherever. It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the container a bit hard to open, but after you open it once or twice it seems to get easier. So, you know, don&#x27;t stress if it&#x27;s hard to open the first time.</li>
    <li> The jar this comes in is really very nice!!  The top and bottom fit perfectly together and is threaded so it stays together when you pick it up.  The scent is an earthy scent with overtones of vanilla and a light floral background.  Very smooth and the scent lasts all day.  I would recommend this product for anyone trying to get away from the normal perfumes!</li>
    <li> I love nag champa incense and this little baby brings me back to the seventies. Makes me remember all the solid scents available back then packaged 3 related scents in compacts, which would be more convenient for handbags.</li>
    <li> The little wooden jar is cool but the scent is not Nag Champa. It reminds me of Dove soap.</li>
    <li> I bought this in August of 2012 and received it in good condition.  However, when I opened it it looked faded around the edges like it had been sitting around for awhile.  When I put it on and smelled it, well it smelled like any perfume that has been sitting for some time.  Old.  I would have returned it but for what I paid for it I would still be out money less shipping so I&#x27;ll just toss it.  Careful buying solid perfume or any perfume from any place other than the original manufacturer or a reputable retailer.  Same goes for skin products etc.</li>
