<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just got this today and set it up in my spa room...it smelled heavenly and not overpowering. It&#x27;s very pretty and easy to use. All the other girls in the spa are ordering one for their rooms as well.</li>
    <li> This is a fun item. It does have a low light so is not totally dark</li>
    <li> Love this , will definitely be ordering more !</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser.  It is quiet.  I like that it turns off when it is done and has very little light when it is turned on.</li>
    <li> The diffuser is very stylish and easy to refill with water.  However, I don&#x27;t believe it lasts an entire 8 hours as advertised.  Overall, I like the product, but I am very disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t run as long as was stated.</li>
    <li> There was no manual or instructions in the box - I have no idea how to use it!  The box also says parts were included that are not.</li>
    <li> love love love this telling everyone at work where I got it.</li>
    <li> Very nice diffuser. I was surprised by its output. Excellent scent throw. I would recommend to anyone looking for a small, room size diffuser.</li>
    <li> Love this alternative to harsh chemicals! Perfect size in our bathroom.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not as thrilled with this diffuser since using it for the last month. It workwd well for awhile then started acting up. It will work for the first hour or so then stop...I clean it like suggested so I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s nit functioning correctly.</li>
    <li> Produces steam, which it came with a set of oils</li>
    <li> This is a great little diffuser. I use it every single day and I love it!</li>
    <li> Does not diffuse any scent, even with wintergreen!</li>
    <li> Love using my diffuser</li>
    <li> It has worked very well right out of the box.  It is whisper quiet and turns off automatically when the water level gets to low.  The only complaint I have is that you are only supposed to use the diffuser for 10 hours before it needs to be cleaned.  I was expecting it to be more along the lines of days.  Regardless, it has done what I got it for well.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser! It runs for a full eight hours and that was my goal</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this runs for about 8 hours.  Adds a light mist to the air while I sleep.  The scents I add spreads throughout the room without being too heavy or overpowering.  Very simple to operate.  I will be ordering another soon for another room.</li>
    <li> smaller stream of steam that I hoped</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser! Nice sleek look and works great. Same quality of the more expensive diffusers but without the cost. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have only had this item for a week and already love it.  Looks nice and diffuses for several hours.</li>
    <li> This diffuser works very well and we have enjoyed using it! A small piece of the plastic base was broken off when we opened the box, so the rubber piece that keeps it from sliding came out. This defect does not affect the performance or balance of the diffuser, so I have continued to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser. It runs for about 8 hours!</li>
    <li> super quite,  love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this diffuser 4 months ago.  I use it daily and I LOVE it!  In regards to cleaning it, I rinse it with very hot water and use the little brush that comes with it.  Then refill it with a couple tablespoons of white vinegar and hot water.  Let it run for 20 minutes, dump and rinse.  Then I use as normal.  I am able to go 3 days before I need to do the vinegar treatment.  I do rinse with hot water and use the brush daily.  Its all worth it to have a diffuser that runs for 8+ hours!  I just purchased a second one to use on my husband&#x27;s night stand to help with his sinuses and seasonal allergies.  He&#x27;s feeling better with just mine on my night stand, but the windows are open due to the nice weather and I feel he would benefit greatly from his own.  I think this diffuser is great, a little regular maintenance goes a long way in ensuring it runs properly.</li>
    <li> This is the best diffuser I have ever had - I loved it so much I bought another one!</li>
    <li> Sleek and efficient! Great diffuser!</li>
    <li> I really like the look of this diffuser and the auto shutoff feature. It diffuses well and has a very strong output.  Two things have been problematic though: 1) The top tends to come off when you pick it up (not good when it is filled with water), and 2) The AC adapter plugs into the bottom (refer back to issue #1--not a good combo).</li>
    <li> So far I really like it!</li>
    <li> Great diffuser.  Works just as stated.  diffuses essential oils into the air for great smells in the home and/or healing properties.</li>
    <li> Decent construction and mists well, also very quiet and I like the 1 yr. warranty. I did return the item because it is listed by Greenair as up to 8 hrs. and 200 ml. capacity. The actual capacity is 150 ml. and misting lasts up to 6 hr. (confirmed by Greenair customer service) I wanted something to last through the night. Customer service did mention the spa vapor 2.0 runs through the night, but I decided to try another brand rather than spend extra for the 2.0.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase another one. 1. The picture makes it appear round but it is not. Front center to back center is 3&amp;#34; and left to right is 7&amp;#34;. (Easy to knock over.) Taking the top off to fill it is agravating. Have to tear finger nails off to get it off. A indention or hold notch would be a huge improvement. Otherwise, it works great.</li>
    <li> I like it. Great design and works well, but doesn&#x27;t seem to quite last 8hrs. I wonder if I&#x27;m doing something wrong. Overall, pleased with my purchase and would recommend it!</li>
    <li> This diffuser is perfect for a bedside table and works pretty much all night! Love the automatic shutoff when it is empty!</li>
    <li> Love it I use it daily! Awesome product</li>
    <li> nice looking. quiet.  good for baby room</li>
    <li> An absolute dream, scents a large area for up to 8 hours</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husbands office as he enjoys some of the more masculine essential oils.  It&#x27;s perfect for his office.</li>
    <li> Thoroughly enjoying my Greenair diffuser!</li>
    <li> Works very well. Fits on top of my dresser next to bed so I can benefit from essential oils from Young Living at night.</li>
    <li> Love my new diffuser . Works great and good price.</li>
    <li> Great for a small area. I put it on my night stand to diffuse while sleeping. Works great for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Just received this today but so far I am loving it!  Makes my living room smell so great!  Added some lemon, lavender, and grapefruit EO to it and turned it on- started working instantly!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Meets one&#x27;s expectation</li>
    <li> Broke within first month of buying and could not get replaced. Do not buy this diffuser. If I could give it a 0 starts I would.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this diffuser!  I was leery of buying a diffuser without seeing it firsthand, but I went ahead and gave it a shot.  I love how this runs almost all night and then shuts off automatically.  A diffuser that runs 8 hours is critical for overnight.  I have run it every night since getting it and have even taken it to work and run it all day there.  I highly recommend this diffuser for anyone.  The price was great, too.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute and if you have a small space I&#x27;m sure it would be great.  I have a large open living space so I don&#x27;t see it working well.  It barely steams and I can&#x27;t smell it unless I go right next to it</li>
    <li> I Love the Greenair diffuser! As a massage therapist I needed a diffuser that was effective but not highly visible in my office. This item is superb at both!</li>
    <li> Love this. Bought one for myself and one as a gift. It runs longer than they say it does. I have had mine last up to 12 hours. The longer it runs the less essential oils you smell but that is expected.</li>
    <li> I have tried several diffusers and I love this one.  Last night it lasted 9 hours.  I do use room temperature water and I think that makes a difference on the length of time it runs.  It does not get the surface around it wet and I love that.  I can also smell the oil I use in it very well.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and use it every day.</li>
    <li> Product looked cool, I have had luck with other GreenAir products (Spa Vapor) so I thought I&#x27;d try it. the power button fell off and stopped working after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> The diffuser works as it should. I love that it lasts for 8 hours. The design is sleek and fits into decor easily.</li>
    <li> Love it!! WIll be purchasing a bigger one for the office.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It doesn&#x27;t last for 8hours like it says we wouldn&#x27;t suggest anyone to buy it</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this easy to use diffuser! It looks great in my house, too :)</li>
    <li> It works well for the first couple of times, and then it clogs up and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well going forward. Even after cleaning as instructed.</li>
    <li> thanks! good product indeed!</li>
    <li> Love this! I an smell the oils instantly as soon as I turn the diffuser on. It is easy to use and to clean! Can&#x27;t beat the price either, I&#x27;ve seen similar units go for triple the price!</li>
    <li> Sent this back did not work the way expected.  Customer support very slow to react.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful!  Nice and quiet.  Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room.  Goes the time it says.  I like it that you don&#x27;t have to refill water tank as often as another that I have.  Saves on oils and no burned oil smell. I bought 2 and I don&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser!  It&#x27;s small, so it fits anywhere!  I purchased the aroma theropy  Kis Oils for the diffuser.  All it takes is 3 to 5 drops of scented oil in the water, turn the diffuser on, and within minutes the rooms of my home are smelling amazing!!  I&#x27;ll be purchasing a few more as gifts!</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser it stays on for 8hrs. If you want a diffuser to last a long time or all night this is the one to get. Love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> A little larger than I expected, but it works Beautifully!!&lt;br /&gt;Quiet and simple.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts about hours before shutting off automatically.</li>
    <li> At first it worked great but now it doesn&#x27;t only a few weeks old!</li>
    <li> Good for a small room, silent and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser with a nice price tag and does the job well.  I wish it had a timer setting.</li>
    <li> sleek lines, quick delivery</li>
    <li> It is awesome. It works better than i thought.&lt;br /&gt;I would tell other to buy.</li>
    <li> I bought 6 to give as gifts and use myself.  After using less than 1 month, 3 have broken including the one I used. On all 3, the on/off button came loose and fell inside the diffuser.  Nice look but very poorly made.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser looks great, works great and easy to use.  I love that is it shuts off when its out of water. Just bought another one :)</li>
    <li> Great little diffuser. Perfect fit for my small bedroom. Works wonderfully, I have it right next to my bed and fill it up before I go to sleep and have aromatherapy all night long!</li>
    <li> Works perfect! would be nice if it didnt have ANY glow for night time use though</li>
    <li> This is a nice size diffuser and for it&#x27;s size you would think it would last the 8 hours that is stated but it&#x27;s lucky to last 4 hours. I was really excited when I first filled with water and added the oil, plugged it in and low a behold it had a great vapor stream but only lasted about 4 hours. So the next night I set it for intermittent and again it only lasted about 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really decided yet but it will probably go back darn it.</li>
    <li> i buy a lot of diffusers and many i send back. whether there&#x27;s not enough mist or they shut off too quickly or you can&#x27;t turn the light off, etc. etc. this one does run for about the 8 hours that it claims (i prefer diffusers that run for longer times). the light shines out from underneath (blue light only) so it&#x27;s not overly bright and can still be turned off. the power light does remain illuminated and is a bit bright if you&#x27;re in a dark room. it puts out a decent bit of mist for its price point. give it a chance to warm up and run a little bit and it will mist more. definitely good for smaller rooms. (if you want something for a larger room you&#x27;d have to go with something like the whisper diffuser). i have this one in my son&#x27;s room and it definitely does the trick. the look of the design is nice too. it blends in nicely with decor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine three months now. Still works great. I recommend this one. I just wish it didn&#x27;t have the tacky chinese symbol on it. I simply turn the lid around so the blank side faces people.</li>
    <li> The diffuser works very well.  It&#x27;s easy to manage and blends well into the surroundings.  Only one problem.  The cover plate for the on/off button fell off into the base of the diffuser.  I can still use the diffuser, not a problem, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be constructed very well.</li>
    <li> Lovely product! Very easy to fill and use. Great room coverage with the essential oil drops.</li>
    <li> Not made very well but it started working after pushing the on button several times.</li>
    <li> So far I love this diffuser.  Works in a large space and last several hours.  The directions were included but aren&#x27;t very clear.  The unit appears to have 2 settings, but I can&#x27;t tell what the difference is.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great design and works well.</li>
    <li> Just right. I use this diffuser daily. Easy to clean. Runs from 5 to 8 hours depending on the humidity.</li>
    <li> I received this item some time around Christmas and until about 2 months ago (March) it worked great. But then the motor started seizing up most times when I would turn it on. I cleaned it regularly as best I could reach, but there are some interior parts that are not accessible. I would not recommend this item based on the lack of longevity of the item working properly, and not being able to access all parts to clean them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice, and it does put out a slow stream for several hours like it claims.</li>
    <li> Great looking and diffuses the oil throughout my entire 2500 sq.ft. house.  Had a problem after about three months with the on/off button falling into the diffuser and customer service immediately sent me a new diffuser with no questions asked.  The on/off button on the first diffuser never worked smoothly but the new one is very good.</li>
    <li> great product, very quiet, nice mist. like the looks, elegant and sleek looking. Been very satisfied with this product and have recommended to friends as well</li>
    <li> love this diffuser.  it is so easy to use and care for.  does a nice job of diffusing oils and sending their scents into the room.</li>
    <li> So awesome and it is so good...no allergy problems with this and oils and it is not overpowering that it makes anyone sneeze!!!!</li>
    <li> Works well, but needs quite a few drops of oil to scent the air. Very pretty unit.</li>
    <li> We diffuse essential oils mainly to make our house smell good, but we also use them for things like lavender to help with insomnia and peppermint for study noses. This is easy to use and easy to clean, and it fills a room with scent. We bought two and will be ordering more for other rooms in the house. Great value.</li>
    <li> This is quiet, and provides the needed moisture in the air.  Love it.  Would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Great diffuser! Lasts 8 hours! Easy to fill and attractive to display.</li>
    <li> After only about 7-8 hours of use, the diffuser stopped working. After following the cleaning instructions that came with the unit, it still would not work properly.</li>
    <li> After many disappointments with aroma diffusers, this one is a gem!!&lt;br /&gt;Quiet, efficient and lovely to look at.  Easy maintenance - no fuss!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of essential oils and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on expensive diffusers.  I bought 4 of these to keep in different rooms in our home and they have all been working great.  4 for the price of 1!  Easy to use and easy to clean.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought two for the bedrooms. Like that the light is not soooo bright. Took them on our vacation easy to clean for travel. Run time is long which I like. You can also set it for a shorter time. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I received my Greenair Aroma Diffuser, Zen in record time!!!! And I am loving it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these 1 works great the other one did not work.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this one. I bought this diffuser because I wanted one that lasted 8+ hours so I wasnt having to refill through the night. The site said 8 hours of use but im lucky if I get 4hrs. It diffuses a good amount which is great.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a good product to use for my home but I ran it through out the day cleaned it with the brush as directed per maintenance instructions and I came home from work and it just wouldn&#x27;t come back on. Sadly I accepted my fait although I enjoyed it for the one month I had it it was not worth the price. Lesson learned pay for what you get.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, but it does not stay on for 8 hours.</li>
    <li> great product !  does everything it says !  very pleased !</li>
    <li> I use doTERRA Essential oils, and was introduced to diffusers by the consultant I bought the oils from. I went Amazon to purchase the one she showed us, but found this Greenair Zen and got it instead for myself (I got one of the other kind for my son). I&#x27;m sure glad I got it! I LOVE IT! It really send out the steamy, oil-scented aroma!!!! I would recommend this one to anyone, and I already have! Sure hope it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I have been using my diffuser for about 6 months.  The fan has gotten slightly noisier when it is first turned on but overall, it has been Performing very well.  I clean the reservoir regularly and I never use citrus oils in it.  The past two weeks, I have noticed an odd smell.  Upon further inspection, there was a large amount of residue around the lid&#x27;s plastic lining.  On most diffusers, this piece is removable for easy cleaning.  Unfortunately, this model is permanently attached.  I have no good way of cleaning all the &#x27;slime&#x27; off of the diffuser, even trying cotton swabs.  For that reason, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> beautiful design and works like a charm....using it with essentials oils for aromatherapy</li>
    <li> Works great! Still chugging along and hasn&#x27;t had issues.</li>
    <li> This is the third diffuser I ordered, due to the others keeping me up at night because of their lights. Though, this one does not have a bright light, the. motor is a bit loud. I am a light sleeper, and use my diffuser mainly at night. The others I purchased made no noise, but had lights, this one has no light, though a bit  noisy, even with ear plugs.  I like that it lasts longer than the others as well. All in all I am happy with the purchase  Update. less than 2 months after purchasing, it won&#x27;t cut on. The light comes on, but it is not diffusing. I have cleaned after each use, and only used filtered water.</li>
    <li> I did my research beforehand and I&#x27;m Very happy with my diffuser/humidifier!!</li>
    <li> So easy to operate! Looks good on the counter, too. It really projects the steam/oil out well. This will make a great gift for my mom, as I will be buying another one for her.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this diffuser.  Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it lasts as long as it says but it works for my needs.</li>
    <li> Love love love this diffuser! Easy to use and works for at least 8 hours on the low setting! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this product. It stopped working just two weeks after I began using it. When I went online to see if I could return it, the return policy stated that my return period had expired. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Perfect for our needs.  Use it every night.  I do recommend.  Has a nice white/fan sound as well.</li>
    <li> Great deodorizer! This diffuser makes my home smell great and you can&#x27;t really hear it! The mist is very even and you can have it on al day.</li>
    <li> I loved this diffuser.  Until it stopped working.  I had it less than 2 months.  What I liked most about it was it was quiet, I was using it in my baby&#x27;s room.  I wish it was made better.  Of course it breaks 10 days after the return policy allows me to get a new one.</li>
    <li> Looks and functions great.  Scent fills the room and it makes no noise.</li>
    <li> Third time I&#x27;ve used it and it is kaput. A complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> very loud compared to others I have purchased, but it is nice looking. it keeps me up at night. the reason why I bought this was for my room to defuse a good night rest blend, but the darn thing is loud and keeps me up, not what I expected.</li>
    <li> These are great because it runs for eight hours. Have just recently gotten in to the doterra oils and this one is cheaper than the one they sell and works just as good!!!</li>
    <li> I finally opened this up today and started it. It has been running all day with no problems. I love that I get to diffuse my DoTerra OnGuard oil while at work. Not only is it making my office smell amazing, but I know that it is purifying the air for me. Very quiet and perfect size. Just sits perfectly on my desk. The smell is definetly making its way through the office and out into the showroom. I can&#x27;t wait to try some more of my oils in it.</li>
    <li> I use this diffuser on a daily basis. I bought a second one after I won one at a oil class. I brought this one to my mothers house to use while we were visiting and and zero issues with it. Works Great!</li>
    <li> This is a great diffuser!  Works great, looks great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small, lightweight and easy.  I don&#x27;t know much about diffusers, and I&#x27;m just now getting into essential oils, but this one was recommended to me and I have to say it&#x27;s rather nice!  I can see the vapor, which is pleasant to look at.  It goes in any room....I&#x27;m using it now as a humidifier/diffuser for my new baby with doTERRA oils.  It&#x27;s pretty easy....just fill it up, add the oil, plug it in and press the button.  It turns off automatically.  You do have to clean it out every 10 hours of use, but that&#x27;s pretty easy too.  Just vinegar and water.  It comes with a little brush to brush it out with too.  And you can&#x27;t really beat the price....it&#x27;s a LOT cheaper than doTERRA or Young Living&#x27;s diffusers!</li>
    <li> And very pleased with the output ease-of-use the plug the portability the color sound mist it&#x27;s  pretty good.  I would like one without water though.</li>
    <li> Worked for a little over a month (after the return period) and then the on/off button fell in and kept running even after water was gone. Looked to me like a fire hazard. Immediately removed it from my child&#x27;s room and discontinued use. Piece of junk that was not worth the money I spent.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I wanted to try a diffuser rather than a humidifier, and I wanted a small one. I also liked that it matched my decor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with it. It does what it says it will do. My only gripe is that it&#x27;s not worth $32.00. It&#x27;s small and made of plastic. It probably didn&#x27;t cost much to make. And, it looks like something you&#x27;d find in the Five Below store -- having said that, I didn&#x27;t find it in the Five Below store so I paid 30 bucks for it on Amazon. I guess it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the price/value, then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I was not happy when I opened the box for the diffuser because it was scratched all over from the packaging!! Also the quality of the plastic look and felt very cheap. I would not recommend this if you are looking for something nice, the only reason I kept it was because I needed it because of my allergies!</li>
    <li> Does not put out mists strong enough to carry essential oils out for smell unless you are near by the diffuser. And the hours for continious use doea not last up to 8 hours as described most only up to 5 hours.</li>
    <li> gave this as a gift to my Mom for her birthday with some essential oils.....she loves it</li>
    <li> I really liked this diffuser, right up until the day where, in my half-awake state I didn&#x27;t put the top on properly. Five minutes later, water had leaked into the motor compartment and the unit was dead. So remember to make sure everything&#x27;s nice and snug before you switch it on! However, to show how much I like the unit, I immediately bought another just like it.    UPDATE: they replaced it for free within 24 hours, even though I explained it was my own fault. Thank you, Greenair!</li>
    <li> Great design.  I love the looks of the unit and it delivers a beautifully scented mist that is wonderful.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I  recommend this diffuser. Works well and it&#x27;s quiet and it turns off by itself. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I love the way it works almost instantly, it last for a long time and that it turns off when dry.</li>
    <li> I love that this diffuser is both super quiet and it has no obvious light.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful! Long running, quiet &amp; attractive.</li>
    <li> The unit is working exactly as described. Too soon to know if it will hold up to the test of time.  It&#x27;s great that it turns itself off the water runs out so that I can go to sleep without concern. Biggest drawback that I have found is that you can not direct the mist as you can do with some models.</li>
    <li> The unit worked for about a month or so. We cleaned it on a regular basis. Eventually the vapor stopped coming out even though the unit was on. Spend a bit more and get a unit that lasts!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent diffuser for the price.  I told all my friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this every single night.  Mostly with OnGuard or Breathe by DoTerra because of the cold I recently caught.  It&#x27;s been a nice addition and has certainly helped.  It&#x27;s attractive and a conversation piece as well.</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING diffuser!! I have 3 of them now &amp; they are the BEST!! They run a solid 8 hrs. then auto shut off!! Thanks!! It&#x27;s Great!!</li>
    <li> Works so well I bought 2. Puts out a steady stream of smell and water vapor. Easy to clean and fill with water.  Silent.  Awesome.</li>
    <li> Description states it runs up to 8 hours. The tank only holds 4 hours worth of water. On the plus side, it does shut off automatically when the water runs out. Still pleased with this item.</li>
    <li> Great product, it goes for at least 8 hours, the only thing is that after a while you really cant smell the oils.  I am not sure if this is because we are just around it so much or if the oils are disbursed so fast that after it runs for a while there is no sent anymore. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price and seems to be great. Can run 10+ hours when full.</li>
    <li> I thought I would &amp;#34;save money&amp;#34; and purchase this adorable aroma diffuser after my previous diffuser broke.  However, I never realized that diffuser could differ.  My previous, more expensive, diffuser did a much better job at diffusing my essential oils and could smell them for hours.  This one, not so much.  Needles to say, I ended up ordering my previous Young Living diffuser to diffuse my Young Living Essential Oils....well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have had this diffuser for about a week and use it with my doTerra essential oils.  It&#x27;s easy to use, diffuses well and lasts 8 hours.  However, the instruction manual that came with it has fine print that says you cannot use citrus oils with this diffuser, which is a huge disappointment because I like to diffuse lemon and most of my oil blends that I want to diffuse have one or more citrus oils in them.  What a bummer!  I was also told by a friend (after I purchased this) that you are not supposed to use plastic diffusers with the oils.  This one is all plastic.  But, it puts out a good amount of mist and aroma from just a few drops and it does last through the night!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great and very decorative</li>
    <li> I bought this on March 7 and it started having issues within a month or so, and it stopped working all together today. I am going to dry it off and see if it makes a difference or not.</li>
    <li> I first bought this approx a month ago and was overall happy enough to buy another. This time, however, it now has the top piece separated into two which makes it a little difficult.  Also, one of the top pieces seems to be a cheaper quality plastic.  Plug-in is underneath unit but not too difficult to get to.</li>
    <li> This is the best diffuser I have purchased that is under $40. It puts out a lot of mist but doesn&#x27;t make a messy on the table. I will buy this one again!</li>
    <li> I use this in my bedroom at night.  It scents the space fairly well.  The on off button does have a light on it but it&#x27;s not too bright.  I just turn it away from me.</li>
    <li> Works great, runs 8+ hours on one fill of water.</li>
    <li> Love this!!  Great diffuser.</li>
    <li> I have this, it looks so nice in my house!  It works fine, and the only reason I couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because (kinda my own fault, but) when I went to move it while full of water and EOs, I grabbed the top and the diffuser fell on the carpet and spilled all over.  The top comes right off, you need to grab it from the bottom!  I kinda wish the top &#x27;clicked&#x27; on or something because i almost did this a second time too.</li>
    <li> perfect product, shipping, and pricing</li>
    <li> I love the diffuser except for the fact it only last 4 hours - if there was a way that it could be delayed....however great look and it works fabulous!  I can&#x27;t use it overnight but I use in the family room when we are all together or could be great for the office!</li>
    <li> works great just what was needed</li>
    <li> Awesome, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. The only thing it&#x27;s that I found out that for my nose, 5 drops of aroma oil it&#x27;s not enough, so I decided to use 8 drops, 1 for every hour that I last on.</li>
    <li> This diffuser gets the job done, but the lid is awkward (takes two hands to remove it) and the water reservoir is poorly-marked.  I have been using it 3-4 nights per week with DoTerra BREATHE blend and find that it is only effective for the person sleeping on the side of the bed that has the end table with the diffuser.  Not a big deal, but worth knowing before buying, I&#x27;d think.  It probably does not help that my bedroom has a vaulted ceiling, increasing the volume of airspace into which the oils diffuse.  As a result, I find that putting 6 drops into the diffuser produces a pleasantly strong scent for the first hour but by the fifth hour there is almost no detectable scent coming out, even though there is still water present and the diffuser is still working.  Again, that is more a factor of the oils than the device, I imagine.  The strength of this unit is that it is QUIET.  That is important to me and it is why this diffuser still gets an overall positive rating from me.</li>
    <li> Although it does not have that strong of a mist coming out and does not automatically shut off, it works okay.  It does tend to get noisy when it runs out of water which wakes me up and I have to manually turn it off.  I have ordered another brand that does auto shut off so I am not woken up by the machine an will be taking this to my office to use.</li>
    <li> Use this at night in my daughter&#x27;s room to help her sleep.  I love that you can disable the light, and it produces a great stream of mist. Best of all, it goes almost all night before running dry!</li>
    <li> Love these I have 4 but the tops melt and I have issues separating the top from the base :(</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic!!! It puts out a ton of oil/water and you can smell the EO. Iat also lasts for a while!! I am thinking of getting one to replace my diffuser as this one was a gift for my mom. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it daily, but every time I use it seems to work just fine.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> What they DON&#x27;T tell you is that you can&#x27;t diffuse citrus oils in this.  I usually read every review before purchasing but did not this ONE time of course!  So I don&#x27;t know if I would have been warned off or not, but just in case not I thought I should post this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Citrus oils are so common in blends and pleasant and AFFORDABLE to use in a diffuser I had to send this back and head out to find a serious diffuser.  I lucked out and found one on sale...It&#x27;s called an Aroma Breeze I think, the kind that uses an air pump anyway and diffuses straight from the bottle these are awesome but usually really expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STILL, if I had the money I&#x27;d have kept this one for the vaporizing AND looks, but it&#x27;s kinda small for just a vaporizer should I need one and silly to have two diffusers going at once if I need citrus and I usually do blend it in! :-(</li>
    <li> Lovin it with my doTERRA essential oils. If you are interested in essential oils contact us at www.elevatelifewellness.com we will get you fixed up!</li>
    <li> We bought this for our son to have in his room.  The top black piece reverses to just black, without the symbol, which is a nicer look in my opinion.  I have 4 diffusers in my home, including this one.  It is very easy to fill and to clean.  It runs for a long period of time and we are very pleased with it.  We have had it for about a month and use it daily, and sometimes run it for two cycles in the day.  We have had no performance issues with it like some of the other reviewers have stated.</li>
    <li> Love it, dose a great job for such a little guy!</li>
    <li> It worked great for the first few months of random use.  One day it just quit working all together.</li>
    <li> I have had it for over an year now and am still using it. I love the look of the diffuser and how it does not seem to be out of place in my bed room. Adding a couple of drops of essential oil make my room smell wonderful but I get the benefits of the oils as well. Only thing that bothers me it that I had to get a bottle of water to set by the diffuser to refill. Not easy to unplug and bring it to the sink to fill. It will diffuse for about 3-4 hours.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s super quiet amd doesn&#x27;t like up the entire room.</li>
    <li> I love this diffuser!  It is very quiet, I use it in my son&#x27;s room and it doesn&#x27;t have a bright light.  I use essential oils in it to keep his room germ free, help him breathe easier during flu &amp; cold season and also use essential oils to help with his moods.  I have to admit, I was leary about this purchase because it didn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles.  I bought it and I am happy I did because it works great!  I am happy with my purchase because it does the job it was bought to do.</li>
    <li> I ordered this diffuser for my office to diffuse Thieves Oil to keep all the germs away during cold &amp; flu season. For some reason I thought it was USB powered. It isn&#x27;t-it has a regular A/C adapter, which works fine for me. It was also actually larger than I thought it would be. I thought it would be smaller and a good size for a desk. It fits on my desk fine but just takes up a bit more room than I expected. It is also a slim design, which I like as opposed to more of a sphere which would take up more room. It also has a larger reservoir than expected so will run for the entire work day. Unlike my home diffuser which has a steady stream of mist, the mist in this one just lightly trickles out. It works fine but was just different than expected. My ONLY complaint is that I wish it had an intermittent mode like my diffuser at home. Instead, it has a low and high setting: Press button once: low, Press button twice: high, Press button three times: off. Since my office is fairly small the scent can get overwhelming fairly quickly and I have to periodically turn it off. I&#x27;ll try using fewer drops of oil next time. The directions say to use 5-6 drops of oil but if using it in a small space I&#x27;d recommend 2-3 (I used 4 and it was too strong).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried using the diffuser with 2 drops of oil and it was much better! I&#x27;d use more for larger rooms though!</li>
    <li> I love it!  I had this on my Wish List for a while and finally decided to get it.  It arrived on Sunday and I&#x27;ve used it everyday since then. It puts out scent amazingly well.  It&#x27;s simple, quiet and the black color goes well with my decor.  Now I&#x27;m ordering more oils to try with it.  Might consider a second one for another room too.</li>
    <li> I already have another one of these and have used it extensively without any problems. They seem to be very well made and they hold up.</li>
    <li> The diffuser wasn&#x27;t putting out enough smoke to fill the room with aroma so were turned it. Upon inspection of our new diffuser there are vents on the bottom that cannot be blocked and were covered due to the towel we had it sitting on. I am unsure if this was this diffusers problem as well, as we had already returned this item.</li>
    <li> Shipped Quickly. Works very well. Product is as described. Runs quietly &amp; diffuses the oil well. I would purchase thsi product again</li>
    <li> I love it! It fits our Asian decor in our home. It is so quite when it runs that you don&#x27;t  even know that it is on and it runs for hours. It fills my living room and dinning room with the smells of my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, only problem is the cover separates from the white top inside and spills water when you change out.</li>
    <li> I bought two. Really like both. I live in a house filled with people who don&#x27;t really clean up after themselves, so this was a need, not a want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I cleaned both, this morning, as per the directions and when I tried to turn them on, nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while I loved the product, I&#x27;m sad that I now have two objects in my home that don&#x27;t work at all, and I&#x27;m back to using those (rather dangerous because they pose a fire hazard) alternate diffusers.</li>
    <li> I do like this product - however, it does NOT last for 8 hours. I have tested this several times.</li>
    <li> This diffuser has served the purpose for which it was purchased. I use it in my bedroom at night. It is perfect for a smaller room. It runs 8 hours and is not obtrusive. I have only had it for about a month, so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s longevity. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works great in 14x14 room.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected, and so far is working as expected.</li>
    <li> I have ordered 2, one for myself and one for family members. The diffuser is easy to use and clean, read the directions. I use it almost every day and have had not problems with it.</li>
    <li> This diffuser works for a good 6 or more hours on a single fill of water and a few drops of essential oil . Great for a smaller more personal space. It works better than other more expensive diffusers I have bought.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 2 months and still like it! Pretty powerful for such a small thing. Only downside is that it&#x27;s a bit tipsy as it is an odd shape. Best to keep up and out of the way where it will be bumped. For the price, this is a great diffuser!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this thing for a couple of days, but I can tell that I will not like it any better in the coming days.  I was hoping that I finally found something for my large living room, but it barely mists at all.  I believe I will be sending this back this week.</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser. Small, but gets the job done. Very happy!</li>
    <li> A little bigger than I thought but I love it.  It works really well, looks nice, and is a great value for the price</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter. She loves it.</li>
    <li> excellent and quiet.  I have used this everyday for the past 2 weeks and love it.  worth the price and I love that it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product ... it works GREAT!! works so well and very quiet while it is in use. I love that it fits in with my decor and doesn&#x27;t have all sorts of different colored lights. It looks good and is a great value.</li>
    <li> New to this.  Bought to use with oils to help with sleeping!!  Great!!!</li>
    <li> it works. and it lasts longer than the 8 hours promised. the greenair website says this is unit stores 200ml, but its capacity is only 150ml. i&#x27;m likely to buy another, but am disappointed by this discrepancy.</li>
    <li> Item was actually delivered a day earlier than expected. It was exactly what I order and it works fantastic!  I may purchase more in the near future.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Some diffusers stop working, but as long as I clean of the sensors, these work amazing! Love the sleek black look and if you don&#x27;t like the Zen sign, just turn it around :-)</li>
    <li> I liked the style of this diffuser. It was small and stylish. The problem was that the on and off button broke the second time I used it. It broke off and fell inside the unit. It rattled around inside.I returned it and got a refund.</li>
    <li> It works great.  I haven&#x27;t timed it to see if it makes it on a full 8 hours (because I&#x27;m mostly asleep while it&#x27;s on!)</li>
    <li> I bought the diffuser for my sister who has a lung disease, and got her some essential oils to help her breathe at night. The first couple of nights it worked amazing, and she really felt some relief, but then the diffuser decided it wasn&#x27;t going to diffuse as much vapor, and now it barely works at all. She cleaned it daily and took the proper precautions as the directions stated. Wish I could return!</li>
    <li> Love this diffuser and I use it every night!</li>
    <li> I love the performance and style of my diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after a few uses, the on/off button came off and fell inside the unit 1/2 way.  I was able to unscrew the bottom and access the button and slide it back into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sherese Hildenbrand&lt;br /&gt;shereseanddave@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the more expensive diffusers, and I love how it looks and that it is narrow so it fits on surfaces that already have decorations!  Be sure to use the brush to clean it between uses though--mine is currently clogged, and I am hoping that the brush will get &#x27;er up and running again tonight!  I highly recommend this diffuser!</li>
    <li> nice sleek design fits into my living room beautifully</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight diffuser, looking something like a black rock with a Japanese character on it, good for zen decor. It works fine, but sometimes the top is difficult to remove once a little sticky from the aromatherapy oil gets on the inner rim. I find if you squeeze it inward from the long directions and lift it comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfectly fine for what it is...a lightweight, inexpensive, attractive diffuser. I think there&#x27;s  a niche for a bit more expensive, elegant diffusers made from natural materials. No clue how that might be done, but it would be cool. I looked but didn&#x27;t find any such in searching for a diffuser, but surely it&#x27;s only a matter of time. Anyway, I&#x27;m putting out the idea for anyone who would like to develop it or sellers who know where to find them already developed.</li>
    <li> This diffuser lasts about 4-5 hrs.  Its good for a small room because it does not put out as much mist as some diffusers this size.</li>
    <li> I use this in my small office. I can see the vapor coming out the top and smell the 4 drops of orange oil that I added.  I notice that I don&#x27;t smell the sent after about 3 hours.  Maybe I got used to the smell or maybe the oil I&#x27;m using is not as &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; as it should be.  I don&#x27;t know.  I still see the vapor and it does last for about 6 hours but I can only smell it when I put my face right above the opening.  I use the NOW brand orange oil but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good brand or not.  Do I like it?  Yes. it&#x27;s cool to look at and not super pricey but it&#x27;s only gives off a slight sent.  I wish it were a little stronger.  I&#x27;ll let you know if I find a solution...</li>
    <li> Not working as well as I had hoped....</li>
    <li> This works very well and is reasonably priced.  I purchased a much more expensive one years ago and Geenair works better.</li>
    <li> The best part about this diffuser is that you can turn off the light coming out of the top. There is still a deep blue light on the on/off button but I can easily cover that up with a sock. The on/off button broke off and went inside the diffuser within days of use. It was still usable, but it kept me from writing a review. The seller contacted me asking me to write a review, I told them it was broken and they shipped a new one out immediately! The other one technically still works but I&#x27;ll put that away for an emergency or something</li>
    <li> Its definitely bigger than i thought it was going to be, but in the best way! it&#x27;s really perfect. i got two and am excited to gift the other to my friend. I will definitely edit my review in the case that anything goes wrong with the unopened one but so far very impressed.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great.</li>
    <li> Works like my first diffuser that I can no longer find. Great product but had to pay more for the Zen symbol?</li>
    <li> Love it, quiet and easy to use. Runs about 6 hours.</li>

    <li> Works great so far, but only used 3 times.  I bought it to go with a timer to come on randomly through the night, but the button has to be pushed each time you want it to turn on.  Won&#x27;t work as I had hoped but I did not ask so it is my fault.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use near children under the age of 25 (drunken accidents happen, doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re high on life), pets, or your library of stevie wonder lyrics.&lt;br /&gt;Sparks every time I plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;Be.&lt;br /&gt;Very.&lt;br /&gt;Careful.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, with the accepted risk, of, I may not have a house one day, it seems to work well.&lt;br /&gt;I turn it on when I&#x27;m in the same room.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s plugged into a power strip.&lt;br /&gt;If I get a power surge or spike, I&#x27;m screwed.&lt;br /&gt;This is your fair warning.</li>
    <li> This is a great defuser for my oils. Run it every night.</li>
    <li> Great item! Easy to use and I never go anywhere with out it. : )</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what other people are talking about but I love this thing I bought the juju essential oil set to go with and for my first night using it I tried 5 drops of rosemary oil and it totally helped soothe me after a stressful day at work. This little thing is powerful. It has a light on it that can be a night light but if you click thr power button it will cut the light off and still works. It&#x27;s super quiet didn&#x27;t even hear that it was on. So happy about this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it, and my son loves it too. Works well, looks nice, and is plastic (kid friendly) unlike the ceramic ones. Best looking non ceramic diffuser I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> I read with interest someof the negative comments.  Fortunately, I can say I have not had one thing go wrong with this, and I&#x27;ve head for over 9 months and use in my bedroom almot nightly.  It runs for 8-10 hrs.  I especially like the water well. I LOVE THIS diffuser. I have several other diffusers...I guess I have been lck because all have worked well, although not all have a large water well. I also have one that operates on battery or can be plugged in.  It is small....perfect for suitcase....will take to Italy with me.  Will find on Amazon and give it a rating.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Helps with headaches and provides a pleasant ambience to the room where it is used.</li>
    <li> It was great until it stopped working 4 months after I bought it :( not sure how to contact the company to get it replaced.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Purchased as present for Christmas 2014.  Gift receiver loves it and would strongly recommend to anyone that wants a diffuser that can be placed unobtrusively and doesn&#x27;t light up.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> OK, I am not hard to please and rarely right bad reviews... Honestly the diffuser worked great.. For about a week! Now it won&#x27;t work so the water and oil just sit in it!! I&#x27;ve cleaned it, unplugged and plugged it back in and nothing! I wish I could return it but of course after the first night of amazingness, I threw out the box!  Save some money and buy a GOOD one, not this one!</li>
    <li> Works great..lasts a long time before refilling.</li>
    <li> I love it. It starts before I go to sleep and shuts off automatically. I am an oil rep and use them all the time. This diffuser looks and works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this through Amazon. It had mixed reviews but for my first diffuser, the price was right and it looked unobtrusive.  It worked twice then quit.  I cleaned it and let it dry, thinking that may help, but no. I looked through the manual but none of their solutions worked either.  It&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> Works great!  No issues at all.  Have been using daily and nightly since it&#x27;s arrival. Update : no longer working well after about 3 months. The machine runs and mist will come out for a while, then stops. It&#x27;s still running, but not coming out. Have followed all cleaning instructions since it arrived. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great item. Doesn&#x27;t put out as much aroma as I would&#x27;ve liked, but could also be due to what oil scents you choose to try. Otherwise happy.</li>
    <li> Nice looking. Easy to fill and clean.  Quiet; I have it in my bedroom and turn it on when I go to bed. Very happy with it.  I also have another diffuser with an adjustable vent that I use in my living room. This one does not have an adjustable vent but diffuses the air straight up; which is what I wanted for my bedroom.</li>
    <li> It’s very easy to use and produces a consistent mist. But it loses a point because of cleaning. Residue builds up on the top piece, and that little brush does not seem to work. Since cleaners should not be used on it, the only way to clean it is to wipe it out, which is not convenient or easy.</li>
    <li> I have only used the diffuser for one night but it worked very well. I set it up in my bedroom and it scented the room successfully. I love essential oils and this is a great way to take advantage of their healthy benefits.  The only complaint I have is that the top part of the diffuser does not latch on to the bottom so I&#x27;d you go to move it,  you have to carefully lift the base too. Also the directions recommend that it be cleaned  with vinegar and water after 10 hours of use. This equals about two days for me.  I&#x27;ve never owned a diffuser so they might all require cleaning after 10 hours but this seems excessive to me.</li>
    <li> This product did not work right out of the box. I have also seen comments that the button is flimsy or breaks easily, I can see how this would happen. If I could give it zero stars I would. Spend the extra $20 and get a better one.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Love the auto shut off when water is gone.</li>
    <li> We really enjoy this little diffuser.  We set it at night with a bit of essential oils.  It turns off when it&#x27;s out of water.  Been using for two weeks every night.</li>
    <li> I love this little vaporizer! Puts out a powerful amount of vapor for such a small unit and fills the air with fragrance. Very easy to use and runs for about 6 hours.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t not come on when power button pressed. It is very sensitive and sometimes it will not even turn on.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Great Price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of these diffuser&#x27;s now, and this one will last for 8 hours at a time. It&#x27;s super easy to clean. I love it!</li>
    <li> am satisfied with it.  works well</li>
    <li> Not impressed. I didn&#x27;t feel like it put out enough of a mist or scent. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Extremely light, easy to use love it</li>
    <li> Great looking for any decor. The diffuser works well with a steady flow. Love the way it turns off by itself.</li>
    <li> The fan was quiet at first but now I can&#x27;t even use it because it is so loud. I wanted to diffuse while in my room at night. It actually woke me up when the fan went. Really a bad product.</li>
    <li> I really like this diffuser. It looks tasteful and is a lot more effective at diffusing aroma than my old one. It is quiet and discreet. It disperses steam indirectly, unlike others that will blow it into only the direction of the nozzle.</li>
