      <li>Good</li>
      <li>tastes good, feels good and its a good value.</li>
      <li>I was eager to try the neem toothpowder, and I have been very pleased</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll be saving more on dental bills!</li>
      <li>So I added it to 4 more parts backing soda, 1 part sea salt: and that was good, yet still to licorice for me; so I added the product Eucryl.  </li>
      <li>I figure if I can&#x27;t do oil pulling maybe this will be as good :)</li>

      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this tooth powder.  </li>
      <li>I love that my mouth just smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;winter fresh&amp;#34; after brushing, too.</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT...................</li>
      <li>I have lived in a place where neem trees grow, so I tried chewing on neem twigs, as I learned that people in India do, and found that my teeth felt very clean after that.  </li>
      <li>It is a gentle abrasive and pleasant cinnamon taste.  </li>
      <li>It tastes good, and my teeth feel very clean with normal brushing, much more so</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a first time user of tooth powder, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with this one.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased to find an effective natural product.</li>
      <li>Cinnamon taste is very mild</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy they offer the 2 pack as I could send a bottle off to my sons house :)  I definitely will purchase again!  </li>
      <li>Gluten Free</li>
      <li>• Flouride Free • Paraben Free</li>
      <li>Sulfate Free •</li>
      <li>It says on the bottle that you can use it for up to 200 brushes, but you have to get skilled at getting the right amount on the brush</li>
      <li>worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I bought this for the first time after reading about neem and about tooth powder for better mouth health.</li>
      <li>If are switching from toothpaste, and looking for something better and willing to give it a try, I think you will like this tooth powder a lot.</li>
      <li>My mouth feels clean when I use it, and my dentist says my gums are &amp;#34;looking good&amp;#34; so I assume the powder is doing it&#x27;s job as it should.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive gums and if you don&#x27;t dump too much on your brush(--it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do the job)</li>
      <li>When you are done your teeth will feel squeaky clean and you will know it is working like it should</li>
      <li>It cleans the teeth squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>nice taste and leaves teeth with that after the dentist professional clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>Recently went to the periodontist and had a good check-up.  </li>
      <li>Good enough for me.  </li>
      <li>The item arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
      <li>arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Trying to pour it on your tooth brush is a great way to waste the product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worth giving it a go.</li>
      <li>and you used the right amount.  </li>
      <li>When I first tried it I got the powder everywhere.</li>
      <li>and hey, if it makes you more likely to brush your teeth like it does for me</li>
      <li>is add some tooth powder into a tiny jar of organic coconut oil, this allows even better cleaning and the coconut oil is antiviral and anti bacterial and my teeth appear even more white.</li>
      <li>It does suds up and cleans very well, in fact my teeth feel just like coming from the dentist!  </li>
      <li>Some people need the foaming action to really feel like they are cleaning their mouth, others want a strong mint taste to have that &amp;#34;just brushed&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>, it is a good buy because one bottle will last for several months.</li>
      <li>, just try remember to use the right amount of powder on your brush and brush your teeth like you always do normally.</li>
      <li>Makes it actually easier for me to brush without the strong taste, and the cinnamon is just enough to taste nice, without tasting overpowering and gross.  </li>
      <li>It would also be easy to take on a trip, as the bottle is small and easy to pack.  </li>
      <li>If you are already on the &amp;#34;tooth powder wagon&amp;#34; I think you will love the way this one cleans and how subtle it tastes (making it easy to use).  </li>
      <li>Doesnt really whiten but cleans and protects well.</li>
      <li>However it soaped up my mouth to much.  </li>
      <li>or else it goes everywhere if you try to put it straight on the brush.  </li>
      <li>Either way, if you are here looking at this review you are probably ready to try something new</li>
      <li>Overall, I really think this tooth powder is fabulous, but it really is a personal preference.</li>
      <li>than I ever felt using normal toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job without giving you all the foamy feedback you normally expect.</li>
      <li>This tooth powder not only cleans well but leaves a fresh taste afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It was a little strange at first, using a powder instead of regular toothpaste, but I feel good about using this as it contains no flouride.  </li>
      <li>this product years ago, feels like I just got out of the dental chair having my teeth professionally cleaned!</li>
      <li>I still do get a bit in the sink after all these years, it&#x27;s just the nature of dumping powder on a small toothbrush head, but you get better with it over time.</li>
      <li>so I am more likely to brush during the day and not worry about eating or drinking later and having a gross aftertaste in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>My dental hygienist did say that my teeth have less receding, gums are healthy, one tiny spot of inflammation and no cavities.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get super foamy and you only need a tiny amount</li>
      <li>With regular use I have had better dental checkups and significantly less sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>It seems to be great at cutting through coffee stains.  </li>
      <li>It is also very beneficial to let the lather remain in your mouth for several minutes according to their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The powder doesn&#x27;t seem to go as far.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;here are the complete INGREDIENTS: Xylitol, Sodium Bicarbonate, Supercritical Extracts of Cinnamon Bark, Cardamom Seed Oil, Neem Leaf, Neem Bark, Anise Fruit, Clove Bud and Grapeseed, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Maltodextrin, Calcium Carbonate, Sea Salt, Silica, Natural Flavor, Stevia Rebaudiana Leaf Extract, Streptococcus Salivarius K12 (probiotics), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D-3)</li>
      <li>but I began to enjoy the taste after only a few days of use.</li>
      <li>Picked this stuff up at wholefoods, makes my teeth feel the same way they do after I get them professionally cleaned!</li>
      <li>no more soapy mouth, taste is refreshing, and for some reason, I am getting whiteness and brightness every single day.  </li>
      <li>very clean - Bottle lasts a long time (looks small though)</li>
      <li>If I was running late and grabbed coffee on the way out the door right after brushing I would end up with mint coffee - yuck!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE IT................... Good alternative to gooey denture fixes!</li>
    <li> great for travel. arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d have know about this product years ago, feels like I just got out of the dental chair having my teeth professionally cleaned! I&#x27;ve been using a sonic tooth brush for years, and combined with neem tooth powder takes it up another level.  My grandson loves to brush his teeth now.</li>
    <li> I have come to hate toothpaste, I don&#x27;t like the feel of it in my mouth and it does&#x27;t seem to clean well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thereaneem  tooth and gum powder is remarkable! No poisonous fluoride. It does suds up and cleans very well, in fact my teeth feel just like coming from the dentist!  Just tap some powder into your palm and pick it up with a wet toothbrush.  It is also very beneficial to let the lather remain in your mouth for several minutes according to their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like to do 3 times a week is add some tooth powder into a tiny jar of organic coconut oil, this allows even better cleaning and the coconut oil is antiviral and anti bacterial and my teeth appear even more white. I figure if I can&#x27;t do oil pulling maybe this will be as good :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest the cinnamon flavor as it won&#x27;t interfere with taking homeopathic products like mint will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here are the complete INGREDIENTS: Xylitol, Sodium Bicarbonate, Supercritical Extracts of Cinnamon Bark, Cardamom Seed Oil, Neem Leaf, Neem Bark, Anise Fruit, Clove Bud and Grapeseed, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Maltodextrin, Calcium Carbonate, Sea Salt, Silica, Natural Flavor, Stevia Rebaudiana Leaf Extract, Streptococcus Salivarius K12 (probiotics), Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D-3) Powder.&lt;br /&gt;• Sulfate Free • Gluten Free • Flouride Free • Paraben Free • No Artificial Colors or Flavors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy they offer the 2 pack as I could send a bottle off to my sons house :)  I definitely will purchase again!  The item arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time user of tooth powder, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with this one.  Wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> SIDE EFFECDTS TOO RISKY</li>
    <li> Here is what i did.  I like this product and will keep buying it.  However it soaped up my mouth to much.  So I added it to 4 more parts backing soda, 1 part sea salt: and that was good, yet still to licorice for me; so I added the product Eucryl.  And this blend is excellent.  no more soapy mouth, taste is refreshing, and for some reason, I am getting whiteness and brightness every single day.  It seems to be great at cutting through coffee stains.  I will keep buying this, it is much better than the clay based products.</li>
    <li> Love it.  My dentist noticed an improvement in my teeth.  I attribute it to not using toothpaste and using this powder.  This does not leave a film on my teeth as does toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth powder.  It cleans the teeth squeaky clean. Neem has been used in India for over two thousand years for medicinal purposes.  This is a great product for teeth and gum health.</li>
    <li> Ok, this product may be health for your teeth, it&#x27;s damn expensive.</li>
    <li> nice taste and leaves teeth with that after the dentist professional clean feeling.  My dental hygienist did say that my teeth have less receding, gums are healthy, one tiny spot of inflammation and no cavities.  I will keep using Neem products.</li>
    <li> Great stuff but so pricey, would like more for my money</li>
    <li> worth every penny! tastes good, feels good and its a good value. it has improved my gum health and reduced plauqe accumulation on my teeth.</li>
    <li> I liked this better in a paste.  The powder doesn&#x27;t seem to go as far.  I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the cinnamon either.  Plus you have to put it in your hand and wipe it onto your brush or else it goes everywhere if you try to put it straight on the brush.  I recommend Neem for toothpaste because it actually healed my gums, but that was the paste.  I tried this as a way of saving money and it didn&#x27;t turn out that way.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been learning about the health benefits of neem and learned that neem bark is antibacterial and can help prevent plaque from sticking to the teeth.  I have lived in a place where neem trees grow, so I tried chewing on neem twigs, as I learned that people in India do, and found that my teeth felt very clean after that.  I was eager to try the neem toothpowder, and I have been very pleased (I&#x27;ve used it for over a week now).  It is a white powder and does not color the toothbrush (as I have read that some neem toothpastes do).  It tastes good, and my teeth feel very clean with normal brushing, much more so than I ever felt using normal toothpaste.  After brushing in the evening my teeth feel good in the morning.  I am very pleased to find an effective natural product.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this doesn&#x27;t have the rather nasty taste and smell that  many neem products have.  It is a gentle abrasive and pleasant cinnamon taste.  It&#x27;s great for sensitive gums and if you don&#x27;t dump too much on your brush(--it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to do the job), it is a good buy because one bottle will last for several months.</li>
    <li> Love the taste and does great job.!</li>
    <li> Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked some of this stuff up to try. Turned out to be better than any paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinnamon flavor is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it is to put a small amount in my hand, and take a wet toothbrush and scoop it up. Anything remaining I lick off my hand. ))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to pour it on your tooth brush is a great way to waste the product. One bottle lasts along time.</li>
    <li> Used to use powder tooth cleaner many years ago. Still prefer it. This has a pleasant taste and works well.</li>
    <li> Tastes terrible threw it away</li>
    <li> Picked this stuff up at wholefoods, makes my teeth feel the same way they do after I get them professionally cleaned! Cinnamon taste is very mild so I am more likely to brush during the day and not worry about eating or drinking later and having a gross aftertaste in my mouth.  Doesn&#x27;t get super foamy and you only need a tiny amount so you&#x27;re not drooling and gagging halfway through brushing. I looked into it a bit and the properties of neem seem to have been validated by clinical trials (of it as a supplement, not as a tooth powder specifically). Highly recommended, small bottle seems a bit pricy but lasts a long time and hey, if it makes you more likely to brush your teeth like it does for me you&#x27;ll be saving more on dental bills!</li>
    <li> I like using this at night (I use a tea tree paste in the morning). It is a refreshing change. It would also be easy to take on a trip, as the bottle is small and easy to pack.  It says on the bottle that you can use it for up to 200 brushes, but you have to get skilled at getting the right amount on the brush so it doesn&#x27;t get wasted.  The ingredients are wholesome.</li>
    <li> This tooth powder not only cleans well but leaves a fresh taste afterwards.  It was a little strange at first, using a powder instead of regular toothpaste, but I feel good about using this as it contains no flouride.  It does contain xylitol and neem bark, both of which have been said to be beneficial in dental/oral health.</li>
    <li> Pros: - Subtle flavor and smell - No overpowering &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; aftertaste - Makes your teeth feel very clean - Bottle lasts a long time (looks small though) - Helps with gum health  Cons: - Can be messy to use - If you like &amp;#34;foamy&amp;#34; toothpaste, this one has little foam action. Can make people think it&#x27;s not working. - Bottle looks very small (but lasts a while)  I bought this for the first time after reading about neem and about tooth powder for better mouth health. Also, I hate the taste of mint after brushing and wanted something that would make it so I could just brush and NOT have to &amp;#34;think mint&amp;#34; for an hour after. If I was running late and grabbed coffee on the way out the door right after brushing I would end up with mint coffee - yuck!  (I&#x27;m the girl who uses Cinnamon Altoids instead of the mint ones :) )  It can be messy. When I first tried it I got the powder everywhere. I still do get a bit in the sink after all these years, it&#x27;s just the nature of dumping powder on a small toothbrush head, but you get better with it over time. Just know that with even spilling a bit everyday the bottle will last a long time.  There is little foaming action, so sometimes you might feel like you don&#x27;t have enough on your brush.  Give up on the bubbles telling you you are cleaning your teeth.  You have to rely on the powder to do it&#x27;s job without giving you all the foamy feedback you normally expect. I still feel like that sometimes, just try remember to use the right amount of powder on your brush and brush your teeth like you always do normally. When you are done your teeth will feel squeaky clean and you will know it is working like it should and you used the right amount.  After using it for a month or so my son came into my bathroom looking for toothpaste after he ran out. He thought cinnamon sounded gross, but tried it so he could brush with something.  That was the last time he used minty toothpaste again (he was 10 or so?). He loves the powder, he said his orange juice at school didn&#x27;t taste gross anymore, and that his teeth feel squeaky.  Good enough for me.  My mouth feels clean when I use it, and my dentist says my gums are &amp;#34;looking good&amp;#34; so I assume the powder is doing it&#x27;s job as it should. I love that my mouth just smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;winter fresh&amp;#34; after brushing, too. Makes it actually easier for me to brush without the strong taste, and the cinnamon is just enough to taste nice, without tasting overpowering and gross.  Overall, I really think this tooth powder is fabulous, but it really is a personal preference. Some people need the foaming action to really feel like they are cleaning their mouth, others want a strong mint taste to have that &amp;#34;just brushed&amp;#34; taste/smell. If are switching from toothpaste, and looking for something better and willing to give it a try, I think you will like this tooth powder a lot. If you are already on the &amp;#34;tooth powder wagon&amp;#34; I think you will love the way this one cleans and how subtle it tastes (making it easy to use).  Either way, if you are here looking at this review you are probably ready to try something new and I think you will be very happy with this one and it&#x27;s worth giving it a go.</li>
    <li> With regular use I have had better dental checkups and significantly less sensitive teeth. Doesnt really whiten but cleans and protects well.</li>
    <li> I prefer toothpowder - tried this one after reading about benefits of Neem.  Recently went to the periodontist and had a good check-up.  Plan to continue using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 months. Though it doesn&#x27;t have the intense minty freshness of the usual toothpaste, I feel it keeps the bad bacteria at bay for longer amount of time and simply returns my mouth to a natural state of health. It is also seems to be making my teeth ever so slightly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor may take just a bit to get used to, but I dislike clove (there is some clove in here) but I began to enjoy the taste after only a few days of use. I&#x27;m looking forward to my next dentist appointment to see how it has improved my mouth&#x27;s health!</li>
