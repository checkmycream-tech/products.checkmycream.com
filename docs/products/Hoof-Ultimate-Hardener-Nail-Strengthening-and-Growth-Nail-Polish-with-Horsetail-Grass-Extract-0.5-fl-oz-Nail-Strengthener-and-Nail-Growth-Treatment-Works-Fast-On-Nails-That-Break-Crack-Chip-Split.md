    <li> Sometimes when you look at different products that claim to strengthen nails and you&#x27;re pretty skeptical because you have tried some that claim to make them strong and doesn&#x27;t do squat. Well when I purchased this products I thought yeah sure it&#x27;s going to help my nail and is this really going to work. Yes this really does work to help make nails strong so they don&#x27;t break . So when I started using it I was shocked to see how fast and how strong my nails where becoming they didn&#x27;t break,chip,peel or look awful for a change.

    <li> I have only worn it once, but I really liked how they made my nails feel. The polish lasted a couple of days and didn&#x27;t chip right away! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Did not work and made my nails worse.</li>

    <li> Works good if u like shine, but it chips really easy. Have to redo almost daily</li>
    <li> I had a thumbnail that for some reason grew out split down the middle... it was like there was a hinge on it and it hurt like hell when squeezed. A few coats of this and it was stronger than ever!</li>
    <li> Really makes a difference when used as directed</li>
