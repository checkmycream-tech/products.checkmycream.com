<li> but if you try to push hard on it, it will cause your eyebrow to fall.</li>
<li> Too bad that some of the stores have cut down their stock or discontinued the Physician&#x27;s Formula.  </li>
<li> the worst product I have bought in a long time.</li>
<li> and I am mad because I have sparse eyebrows.</li>

    <li> I like how the eyebrow pencil applies, and I also like the brush that comes with it, but the color is just a little off for my eyebrows.  The shade of brown doesn&#x27;t work for my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find my favorite eyebrow pencil online.  Too bad that some of the stores have cut down their stock or discontinued the Physician&#x27;s Formula.  This is the right color, and has the brush for the natural look.</li>
    <li> Finally! Found A  GOOD Blonde Brow Pencil That&#x27;s Really Easy To Apply!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement to Origins &amp;#34;Fill In the Blanks&amp;#34; eyebrow pencil and a friend recommended the Physicians Formula Brow Definer.  I wanted to try the pencil made for blondes and had to go to Amazon to find the blonde color.  I think it is almost as good as the Origin eyebrow pencil  and will continue to use it.  The &amp;#34;Fill In the Blanks&amp;#34; product is great but I think they have cut back on the size of the pencil, as it does not last nearly as long as it used to.</li>
    <li> I love the color and the way it goes on.  I cannot find it any more where I live and need some more!!!!</li>
    <li> Nice color for an ash blond.  Kinda stays but it has not been put to the real test which for me would be lasting through a Zumba or ballet class.</li>
    <li> Great service and good product</li>
    <li> I will always use this brow pencil, the color is nice and I no longer get hives on my face when I use it.  It pays to shop and compare!  I am sold on this.</li>
    <li> I have use this product for years but cannot find it in stores any longer.  It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I found the price to be very good and I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore. It&#x27;s the perfect color for women with my hair and skin color. I am a golden blonde with fair skin and many other brow pencils look garrish. I am happy to know where I can reorder this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this make up.  I looked all over for this color and was happy to find it here!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> applies nicely; good color</li>
    <li> FINALLY a brow pencil that doesn&#x27;t have a touch of red in the brown.. I am blonde, and this is the closest pencil I have found after many years of searching.  I would prefer to find one a little lighter, but this is the best so far!</li>
    <li> Excellent pencil to subtly accentuate light colored brows.  It is easy to apply and gives a light touch of color that isn&#x27;t heavy or overdone.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous eyebrow pencil! It doesn&#x27;t look drawn on because I can put it on as softly as I choose. I have more control with this pencil than I&#x27;ve had with any other brand. The result is precisely what I want. It&#x27;s available in a few colors and I like them all! I recommend this for anyone who prefers natural brows. I will absolutely continue to buy this pencil!</li>
    <li> I love that this product is a light enough color to use during the day. I am fair-skinned and a lot of what I find in the stores are the darker shades/colors.  This looks very natural.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> the worst product I have bought in a long time. Not only it is very very colorless but if you try to push hard on it, it will cause your eyebrow to fall. I had 6 hair falling from one brow and I am mad because I have sparse eyebrows.</li>
    <li> As dark blond turns to gray tones, this brow definer is a hard-to-find must have for the makeup kit.  Just enough color to give back a sense of nicely defined brow, without looking &amp;#34;drawn on&amp;#34;.  Applies with ease.  Built in sharpener keeps strokes crisp til used up.</li>
    <li> Takes a lot of work to get any color to stick. Will stick with my regular pencil.</li>
    <li> Great color makes those stray hairs stay in place no drag on eyebrow pen  love this product. Foe girlswith blonde highlights blonde beige is the best color</li>
