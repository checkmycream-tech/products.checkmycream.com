### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even had my best friend (who happens to dothis for a living) help/</li>
      <li>Best and cheapest waxing to use for all year around</li>
      <li>Best results if you microwave it</li>
      <li>I used it on my face but it worked great!!!</li>
      <li>i give this one 5 stars :D</li>
      <li>/&gt;The pain I felt was exquisite!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is the best!</li>
      <li>and it works wonderfully!</li>
      <li>It works wonderful</li>
      <li>Best hair removal product I&#x27;ve found!</li>
      <li>To my shock, it worked great!  </li>
      <li>and I was happy with it!</li>
      <li>I have been using Nads for 3 years and think it is an impressive product.  </li>
      <li>No heat needed at all, which is just wonderful!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sticky and it takes off more skin than hair!!!!</li>
      <li>Nad&#x27;s is awesome!</li>
      <li>Nad&#x27;s No-Heat Hair Removal Gel is the best one.</li>
      <li>it worked great!</li>
      <li>It has been working perfectly for me!</li>
      <li>Excellent for women&#x27;s face, legs, and bikini area.  </li>
      <li>Great results!</li>
      <li>Denim fabric works perfect and they stand up well thru washing, the edges will fray but that doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is the best for pricing and delivery speed.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Nads for years and it works great!</li>
      <li>I also found that heating the gel in the microwave for 15 seconds greatly improved its spreadability.</li>
      <li>The best reason to give for using NADS is the solubility; if you get it on an area where it shouldn&#x27;t be, you just use a warm washcloth to wipe it away.  </li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re brave go for it.</li>
      <li>I was quite happy with the results, and even now I must emphasize that this product is great for legs.</li>
      <li>The gel pulls on the hairs, causing great discomfort, something I did not experience during the leg test.</li>
      <li>lol...</li>
      <li>Does anyone know if this is great for pubic hair ?</li>
      <li>It removed the great majority of the hair.</li>
      <li>It comes with re-usable strips, too, which is great because I&#x27;ve found the wax lasts longer than the strips.</li>
      <li>but it STILL worked great.  </li>
      <li>GREAT product.</li>
      <li>It worked great.  </li>
      <li>, great results and the washable strips are genius</li>
      <li>it works great.  </li>
      <li>Love this product!!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, too!</li>
      <li>Ok, so my best friend used this on my eye brows when we were teens</li>
      <li>I have to say, i was pleasantly suprised -</li>
      <li>What I like best is that it cleans up easily with water.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a good job, doesn&#x27;t remove the hair.  </li>
      <li>i cut the strips into halves, quarters and eighths to have a good range of sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i have used this product for over 10 years and it still works as good as it did the 1st day</li>
      <li>My eyebrows look just as good as if I had them done at a salon.</li>
      <li>Wife said its wonderful, which is a very rare thing, so it must be good.</li>
      <li>I would suggest to keep trying - it really is wonderful to be able to hop in the shower after waxing and be able to rinse the residual off with warm water!</li>
      <li>The best feature is that it is water soluble-no need for oils to clean up.</li>
      <li>My search for the perfect wax stops right here!</li>
      <li>It removed all my unwanted body hair quickly, painlessly and perfectly!</li>
      <li>A fabulous, wonderful amazing product.</li>
      <li>I used it to remove hair on my legs and underarms and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>It works about as good as the others, hurts no matter what kind you use.</li>
      <li>I needed to save money on waxing my eyebrows and $17 for a bottle that will probably wax my eyebrows 100 times or more was a bargain!</li>
      <li>I am in love with this product!  </li>
      <li>Been using Nad&#x27;s for over five years and still love it!  </li>
      <li>Love Nads!</li>
      <li>I Love This Stuff!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love Nad&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>Waxing is my preferred method of removing hair on my legs (epilating works best for my underarms, and I prefer a trimmer for down below), and this is the best waxing system on the market.  </li>
      <li>You have to heat it in the microwave, but it&#x27;s easy and very effective.</li>
      <li>Amazing product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that this wax always does a great job at removing all of the hair, and I enjoy the cloth strips as well.  </li>
      <li>Your body heat will warm it.  </li>
      <li>I warm the gel for about 12 seconds in the microwave</li>
      <li>It smells nice, and works well.  </li>
      <li>Came with plenty of cloth strips which I soak in warm soapy water afterwards.</li>
      <li>This leads to many more ingrown hairs than I experienced with Nads.</li>
      <li>I had to warm the wax for 15 secs in the mricrowave.</li>
      <li>When it first hit the market some time ago I loved this product and was happy to find it on line.</li>
      <li>and it was very easy to use.</li>
      <li>This is the most effective &amp;#34;waxing&amp;#34; product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s perfect, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>Nad&#x27;s seemed too good to be true...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very important to create tension in the skin, or the skin will pull with the cloth and gel, and the hair removal will not be as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and effective.</li>
      <li>natural good product that does the job of salon waxing at fraction of the cost and you maintain your own cleanliness!</li>
      <li>Nad&#x27;s easily washes off the strips and me with soap and warm water.</li>
      <li>The cloth strip rinses out easily and completely in warm water for re-use.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure as time goes on</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>For most people, it will hurt, but it does work if you use it correctly.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>and I do it for many times but</li>
      <li>Glad to see it on Amazon and setup for delivery.  </li>
      <li>Trust me this stuff takes off more skin than hair.</li>
      <li>I have used Nads for years and think it is the best thing since white bread!</li>
      <li>&quot; on my skin like it said, AND HELD MY SKIN, paid attention to the hair growth rule {apply in the direction growing, take away in the opposite direction for the best results} still excruciating and bruised!!!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>That will help you get more mileage out of it.</li>
      <li>nad&#x27;s is wonderful for hair removal, especially if you&#x27;re worried about making mistakes.</li>
      <li>, then I don&#x27;t have to wax again for 2 weeks or more.  </li>
      <li>cloth strips can be reused many times.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m been using this home waxing product for over 8 years now. Never had a problem and all hair came out when I follow the instruction to use. Best and cheapest waxing to use for all year around</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many waxes and I always find myself looking for Nad&#x27;s. It works about as good as the others, hurts no matter what kind you use. What I like best is that it cleans up easily with water.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nads to remove armpit hair for 8 years now. It is easy to use and effective. I have tried other waxes, but found the temp was a major factor. If the other waxes were too cold, they didn&#x27;t work. If they were too hot, they burned the skin. Regardless of if you are a novice or expert at hair removal, I think this product will work for you.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried Nad&#x27;s, I managed to give myself bruises and bled under the skin which eventually became scabs. After that, I was scared to get near it.    Almost 10 years later, I decided to give it another try. I had relocated to the Midwest from Los Angeles and my leg hairs had grown out over the winter. I felt that it was long enough to try waxing and did not want to bother with shaving because I have to take a California shower since my hot water tank is small.    I read other reviews where people suggest spreading the gel as thinly as possible. The directions inside the package says the same. WOW, lo and behold... it got the job done and did not hurt much! It removed all the thicker coarse hair (I am Asian) and just left invisible peach fuzz behind.     While shaving with a razor would have gotten rid of the peach fuzz as well, the peach fuzz is so light, I can only see it if I literally press my face up to my legs. I was able to remove my arm and underarm hair with the same amount of ease, too.    I used very little of the gel and only required 4 strips total. 1 for each leg and 1 for each arm and underarm. Using as little gel as possible is the key to making this work. You can reuse the strip since the gel is still sticky without spreading additional gel on other parts of your leg or arm or wherever.     Nad&#x27;s is awesome! Just be patient with the learning curve.</li>
    <li> I have a lightly tanned skin color with a dark blond hair color. I have dark thick hair on my upper legs and lower legs, and dark hair on my arms. My hair grows very fast so shaving is pointless for me. If I shave in the morning the hair is very noticeable by the evening. I have used Nads (original Gel) on my legs, bikini area and a little farther back, arms, arm pits, and lower abdomen with great results.   It was slightly painful the first time I used it. There are sensitive areas that will always be painful, like the bikini, ankles, back of the knees, inner thigh, and arm pits. You have to make sure the areas are clean (as in take a shower before you do it) and completely dry. That means no lotion residue or sweat. It will hurt more and you will not get the hair removed. I usually put a towel on the ground to sit on and have a wet wash cloth to wipe up any mess that may occur.   I have been using Nads (original Gel) for about 13 years now. I wash and dry the cloth strips with my laundry. I wash them in warm or hot wash setting in a zippered mesh or lingerie bag. They are just a bit wrinkled when they come out of the dryer. I iron them some times, but mostly just deal with the wrinkles. They work just the same as they did when they were new.</li>
    <li> I love that cleanup is so simple with this gel. It&#x27;s water soluble, so no annoying, hard, impossible-to-remove clumps are left behind (but it is VERY sticky--make no mistake about that). I also love that the cloth strips are reusable--that means one less product to buy! I will recommend heating up this gel slightly before using so you can spread a thinner layer on your skin. That will help you get more mileage out of it. Other than that, I think it&#x27;s very simple to use, very effective, and I will now be buying Nad&#x27;s instead of going to get waxed!</li>
    <li> I bought Nad&#x27;s natural hair removal gel 6 oz from CVS for $20 and I am very upset. I try to remove hair from face and I do it for many times but still it doesn&#x27;t work well,specially ticker hair it doesn&#x27;t remove at all.</li>
    <li> GREAT product. I only gave it 4 stars because I wish a larger quantity was given for the same price; I used more than half for just my legs.&lt;br /&gt;still, great results and the washable strips are genius</li>
    <li> I thought this would be totally different from other waxes I&#x27;ve used, but it wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s sticky and it&#x27;s only saving grace regarding that is that it is easily wiped off with water. It&#x27;s messy and it does need to be heated majority of the time. It&#x27;s also not very effective. The waxes I&#x27;ve used hurt but they removed the hair, not this stuff. It hurts and barely any hair is removed. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Got a different product. Nads sangria which is red not green and the package says you have to heat in microwave. Disappointed</li>
    <li> Nad&#x27;s is the easiest hair removal product I have ever tried. The best feature is that it is water soluble-no need for oils to clean up.</li>
    <li> Does anyone know if this is great for pubic hair ? I know it sounds gross but thats what I&#x27;m looking for most .</li>
    <li> My wife used to get waxed professionally but that was very expensive and in a bad economy it&#x27;s unaffordable. So she tried Nads and loves it! People who don&#x27;t like Nads are either using it improperly or just have problems with waxing. This does not require heat like at a salon. You also can&#x27;t burn yourself either. If you try to use this on a hot day when you are sweating it will not work.  It helps to buy a roll of professional grade cloth to use for the strips and don&#x27;t overuse that cloth because after a while the cloth stops sticking. She buys that cloth for pretty cheap at a local beauty supply store and it&#x27;s lasted her 2 years so far.  She has been using Nads for almost 4 years now. We used to buy it locally but it&#x27;s much cheaper buying through subscription on Amazon.  If you want pain free don&#x27;t wax, waxing is painful at first.  Nads is sticky and a bit messy but most waxes are. This does a great job of removing hairs and she has tried a lot of stuff that is similar and none of it works. She prefers this over professional way because of the heating time required and it always gets too hot.  If this isn&#x27;t working for you then you probably need advice on using it correctly.</li>
    <li> Ok, so my best friend used this on my eye brows when we were teens and it always worked. Since moving to a new town, I cannot find someone to do my eyebrows correctly for the life of me. For this reason, I decided that I might be able to use Nad&#x27;s on myself and do a bette job than the half a dozen people I&#x27;ve let wack my brows recently. I&#x27;m a little anal, so it took me about half an hour (also because I was afraid of ripping off my entire brow!), but the results were perfect! I even sent a pic to my friend and she approved! I will never go back to a salon again! I&#x27;m sure as time goes on I will try it out of other body parts, but for now, I&#x27;m stoked with my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One addition, I read a lot of the reviews before I bought it, even though I used it years ago (It&#x27;s amazon, so you have to read the reviews!). Most of us know if we have sensitive skin or not. I&#x27;ve always felt like I do not have sensitive skin, so maybe that&#x27;s why it works for me. If you have sensititve skin you may want to read up before trying it.</li>
    <li> I am new to at home waxing and after trying Sally Hansen&#x27;s lavender at home wax kit (huge mess and difficult to use!) I decided to take a risk and try the Nad&#x27;s no-heat hair removal gel.  I am absolutely in love with this product now.  I used it to remove hair on my legs and underarms and am very pleased with the results.  This product comes with the hair removal gel and 5 linen strips for hair removal.  Clean up is a breeze; the gel is water soluble so if you get it on the bathroom counter, floor etc.. just use a wet washcloth to wipe it off! The strips are also washable and so can be reused.  My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t finish a whole leg with the 5 strips that they provided so I&#x27;ve had to wax in stages while the strips are drying after I wash them. But other than that, great product, and so much less painful than the Sally Hansen crap I tried before.</li>
    <li> I microwave for 20 seconds even though it says No-Heat and it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I love Nad&#x27;s! It&#x27;s a little tough to use straight out of the package so I just warm it up for 30 secs in the microwave and put it in a bowl of warm water and stir it up until its soft and pasty. It gets a little messy so keeping a towel nearby will come in handy. I typically keep up with my Brazillian waxing and for me it hurts less when I do it versus going into a salon and having some stranger do it and not giving you time to brace yourself (pus I&#x27;m saving a butt-load of money doing it at home). The nay-sayers of this product are obviously doing something wrong or just don&#x27;t get the fact that waxing will hurt regardless of what your pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it&#x27;s super convenient to just toss the cloth strips into the washer with the rest of my laundry. But I don&#x27;t stick them in the dryer, I just hang-dry them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product sparingly over the years since I don&#x27;t have much hair, and I use it mostly on my legs.  It works ok for the most part, but it can be a little messy since the product often leaves some residue.  The cloth strips that come with it can also fray at the edges, which can be annoying as threads come out while you&#x27;re nadding away.  For most people, it will hurt, but it does work if you use it correctly.</li>
    <li> No heat needed at all, which is just wonderful! Just remember to read &amp; follow all directions beforehand if this is your first time using this product. It has been working perfectly for me! Quick &amp; simple to use. Excellent for women&#x27;s face, legs, and bikini area.  Great results!</li>
    <li> After having my cats tip over a can of wax on my bathroom shelf and not noticing until the entire thing had leaked out of the container somehow, I decided I needed a water soluble alternative.  Nad&#x27;s is the only one I could find and it&#x27;s amazing!  I went through a period where I could not get it to work, like some others, but I figured it out - you need to apply just a thin layer or else you will just rip the wax off and the hair will not come with it.  When I started having problems, I just experimented with different amounts of wax and time and I finally got it down.  If you are having problems, you are probably just doing it wrong.  I would suggest to keep trying - it really is wonderful to be able to hop in the shower after waxing and be able to rinse the residual off with warm water!</li>
    <li> Nad&#x27;s Hair Removal Gel is a good product for dark, more coarse hair. Like many hair removal products it is not as good on fine, blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Hairless without the embarrassment. I hate getting this at the store but I love the feeling of being hairless. it&#x27;s embarrassing sometimes getting it at the store having to teller look at you weird, even though I know they could careless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nads for years and it works great! Does not need heat but I&#x27;ve found a few seconds in the microwave to make it warmer helps the hair come out better and is less painful. [...]</li>
    <li> I have ordered and re-ordered this item.  It is faster than the epilators you see on TV, and no more uncomfortable to use.  The best reason to give for using NADS is the solubility; if you get it on an area where it shouldn&#x27;t be, you just use a warm washcloth to wipe it away.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be heated as hot as wax, so your skin has much less irritation.  There is no odor.  Other products from this company are well priced, and complement the removal gel.  Amazon is the best for pricing and delivery speed.</li>
    <li> This product leaves alot to be desired... it does not remove all the hair... and the little hair that it does remove is torturous...i still had to end up in the waxing salon after this...better luck next time i guess...</li>
    <li> I LOVE Nad&#x27;s. I tried it for the first time last night, and I can&#x27;t believe I have never tried it before. It removed all my unwanted body hair quickly, painlessly and perfectly! I love that I don&#x27;t have to heat it up, and it is totally water soluble. Also, this product truly is all natural! And the strips are re-usable. Nad&#x27;s easily washes off the strips and me with soap and warm water. A fabulous, wonderful amazing product. I&#x27;m a fan!!!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!  I just used it for the first time today.  I had never waxed my arms today, so there was a lot to remove.  I have very sensitive skin, so I was halfway expecting a rash. There was no adverse effect on my skin at all.  My hair was removed quickly and thoroughly.  Clean up was a breeze!  The gel dissolves in water.  I was wary of putting the washable strips in the washing machine, as they looked like they would fray and come apart.  I decided to rinse them before washing, and to my surprise, the gel came right off!  A gentle hand washing is all it takes to get these strips clean.  I think this is a great value, because I used a very small amount of the gel and the strips are reusable.  The jar still looks full.  I do have one small bruise, but this was my own fault: I attempted to wax too large of an area, and towards the end of the strip I pulled upward (exactly as the directions warn not to do).  That was very painful and left a bruise.  After that I waxed smaller areas and was careful to pull the strip back close to the skin instead of upwards.  This method was not painful and was more thorough at removing the hair.  Afterwards, I simply rinsed my arms with water and pat-dried.  No need for wax removal oils (which can be very irritating on my skin).  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with this product for a few weeks and it still gives me grief. I&#x27;m going back to threading.</li>
    <li> This stuff is THE messiest and most painful hair removal system I have ever tried. I have tried lots of different heated waxes from the ones that use a cloth and ones that do not. This is not worth the money. There is a reason the salons do not use this crazy stuff, folks...</li>
    <li> I used this yesterday to remove the hair on my face -- it&#x27;s fine hair, but there&#x27;s a lot of it. I waxed upper lip, \\&quot;sideburns,\\&quot; and under my chin. I am extremely pleased with the results. The gel was a little messy but it rinses right off so not really a problem. It removed the great majority of the hair. I experienced mild discomfort, but it was much more comfortable than either having someone else wax me or having electrolysis, both of which I&#x27;ve tried in the past.    I have a little irritation today, which is typical for me after waxing, but overall I really prefer the Nad&#x27;s gel to other waxes. I noted that other reviewers didn&#x27;t have similarly good experiences, and I wonder if Nad&#x27;s is perhaps more effective (and less painful) on finer facial hair than on coarser body hair? Just a thought. Anyway, I&#x27;m really happy to not have a moustache today :) and would recommend Nad&#x27;s for other ladies with facial hair.</li>
    <li> I know there&#x27;s a lot of back and forth, so whether this product works for you may just depend on you.  But it definitely works for me.  I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving. I also hate animal testing and icky, irritating chemicals (such as those found in depilatories).  Nad&#x27;s seemed too good to be true...but it isn&#x27;t.  People who seem to have problems with it also seem to be not following the directions. It says right there in the packaging to put on a THIN layer. If you do that, instead of glopping it all over the place, it really works.  There are some minor tricks to it, but it&#x27;s not that hard to figure out (such as, it may solidify, but just pop it in the microwave for 10 seconds and you&#x27;ll be fine. It won&#x27;t even be hot). Just follow the directions!  I get baby smooth, stubble free legs for at least a guaranteed month with this stuff. I&#x27;ll never go back to razors.</li>
    <li> I have used Nads for years and think it is the best thing since white bread! Seriously. I&#x27;ve been to salons and the cost is one issue and then having to schedule my time around the salon&#x27;s availability. I do this myself and it&#x27;s perfect, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product locally. When it first hit the market some time ago I loved this product and was happy to find it on line. However something has changed, the color was cloudy green and not how I remember it. Formerly it waxed my legs smooth and lasted for weeks. I will not buy this product again. It only broke the hair off at the skin, and I still had hair nubble after using it. I am was licenced and know how to wax.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued with this product since the info-mercials.  In real life it&#x27;s very messy and only removes some of the hair.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is a quick but far from painless way to remove body hair.The instructions are easy to followand the gel is very effectiveandit last for weeks-this product is very hard to find in local chain stores</li>
    <li> Will not order again.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it says, but takes a little mastering as it can get a little messy. I like that the removal strips are washable so that cuts down on needing to get more everytime you use the gel.</li>
    <li> it works ok on legs and underarms. Works better if you use a little heat ( Like a hairdryer), they say no-heat, but it&#x27;s really hard to use with no-heat!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now, but I&#x27;ve been having difficulty finding it in the retail stores.  My order arrived on time &amp; took all the stress out of going store to store hoping to find it.  It was worth the shipping cost for what it saved me in time &amp; gas.</li>
    <li> I swear I will never shave again after using Nads no heat gel!    There will always be those who are not satisified with a product for whatever reason but if you follow the directions carefully, you will get fantastic results!</li>
    <li> This is the only wax I will use...nothing else compares to it.</li>
    <li> Too messy, sticky. It doesn&#x27;t do a good job, doesn&#x27;t remove the hair.  Even the smaller applicator for facial hair did a poor job.  I bought fabric strips, and the gel does wash out easily so they can be reused. Going back to waxing. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love it this really works and doesnt murt much compared to other hair removal methods i have used. Its very sticky so be careful but it washes right off  your hands and clothes with water like soap ***** i give this one 5 stars :D</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of Wax products for my legs and bikini area, this is hands down the best, I used ZIP wax for years, which had to be heated, was messy, smelled and stuck to my clothes, skin, etc. and burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NADS is so simple, just put a layer on, put muslin on top and hair is gone, also if you get some on your hands it tastes like candy, No mess, just put water on your legs and it comes right off. My only problem is I wish the jar came in a larger size, With one jar i can wax both my lower legs and my thighs but need one more for the bikini area.</li>
    <li> The gel was extremely difficult to spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No heat required, melts with your natural body heat&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good one. I put it right in the trash. #FAIL</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nad&#x27;s for years.  Great product if you follow directions (exfoliate, dry, lotion free, don&#x27;t microwave the product, etc.).</li>
    <li> Now for the people r wondering why a male is using this product, it is because I&#x27;m a bit hairy in some areas that i want to get rid of without constantly shaving. I like being hairless. Anyways besides that lil disclaimer, it was one of the worse products I&#x27;ve used for waxing. it was messy as hell, it got stuck on my fingers and my parts of my legs that i didn&#x27;t want to get waxed. It only removed some hair here and there and it gave me bruises on my upper inner thigh (I don&#x27;t bruise easily). SO ALL IN ALL I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY BODY.</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past and came back to it.  Very little discomfort and easy to use.  I throw the gel in the microwave for 10 seconds and it makes it easier to apply.  This kit includes the gel, applicator, 5 fabric strips and 3 cleansing wipes.</li>
    <li> This product works everytime I use it correctly. In my book a total winner. I&#x27;ve been using Nads for at least five years and have not desire to change.</li>
    <li> I have a challenge with this product. I&#x27;m not sure if I am not getting the wax hot enough or I am just not doing it right but I find the wax just slides off the hair and doesn&#x27;t attach. Odd....</li>
    <li> Though while it&#x27;s  meant to be a no heat wax I have to heat it up because for some reason the wax looked like it had be frozen or something. But once I heated it up it worked fine. Overall my order arrived in a timely manner and I was pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> the product does work, but you will feel the pain...i did my stomach and chest.  i felt sunburned for 2 days  lol...but im smooth as a baby</li>
    <li> This is the best and easiest and least painful way I have found to give myself a bikini wax at home.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Very hard to find in the stores;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for caring it. It works wonderful and I plan on buying more from you if you keep it in your inventory.</li>
    <li> I like nad&#x27;s a lot.  It smells nice, and works well.  I like to heat it up a bit by putting the jar into some hot water.  It slides on better, and hurts less when applying.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Easy and clean to wax with. No skin rush when I did the waxing. Not steaks as others.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  For me, the name is very misleading because it does require heating. Otherwise, it is just too difficult to work with.  The reviews were pretty split as to whether the product worked or easy to use.  So, I thought I would just try it out. Not something I would buy again...</li>
    <li> My first foray into waxing involved regular (i.e. not water-soluble) wax.  Huge mistake.  I didn&#x27;t work fast enough, so the wax hardened onto my skin and when I pulled the strip off, my skin came right off with it.  OUCH.  Then I discovered water-soluble wax, which isn&#x27;t actually wax at all, but a sticky sugar/honey solution.  It worked pretty well, but I&#x27;ve burned myself a few times with the heated wax.  Then I tried chemical depilatories, but they always irritated my skin.  When I realized I was giving myself a chemical burn every time I used the product, I had to stop.  So then I tried this gel.  My hair was really too short to try waxing, but I wanted to check the consistency so I tried it anyway.  To my shock, it worked great!  I didn&#x27;t even heat it, as I planned, so the wax was too thick to spread thinly but it STILL worked great.  Maybe the cloth (instead of paper) strips grab the gel better?  The cloth strip rinses out easily and completely in warm water for re-use.  Next, I tried this on leg hair.  It was much too thick to spread well without heating, so I microwaved it for 15 seconds.  It worked great.  I made a bit of a mess on the countertop but a wet rag easily cleaned up any messes.  My search for the perfect wax stops right here!</li>
    <li> So I tried Nad&#x27;s no heat eye brow removal gel kit and fell in love with it and so this seemed like a natural next step.  Boy was I wrong!  I can only assume if you are used to waxing that this would be okay for you, but holy crap this stuff hurts to remove hair from your legs and so I can&#x27;t even imagine using it anywhere else....youch!  Not sure why it doesn&#x27;t bother me on my face, but leaves huge welts after using on my legs, but this is not for me.  Granted, I am not a waxer, but only expected I would feel a little discomfort with some small bumps afterwards...this was too painful for me to do more than the first strip.  Oh well, back to shaving!</li>
    <li> I Love This Stuff!  It works wonderfully, is easy on the skin (considering what you are doing) and it is water soluble.  It smells nice, too!</li>
    <li> I have used it for years</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to use the product because I&#x27;ve never waxed before, but it worked great.  Also, I have sensitive skin &amp; had no problems reacting to the product.</li>
    <li> As previous reviewers have acknowledged, personal preference and experience makes a difference, but as someone who has tried just about every form of hair removal, this gets the job done -- easily and inexpensively.  If you find it too messy, the Nad&#x27;s strips are good option, although more expensive and a little less effective.  A few tips that might address issues other reviewers have had:&lt;br /&gt;• Unless your house if really cold and you can&#x27;t get the stick into the product, it&#x27;s okay if it seems thick.  Your body heat will warm it.  Really no need to heat it up.&lt;br /&gt;• Use the stick to spread and even remove some of product so that you have a thin layer.  That ensures that the strip will pick up the product (and your hair) completely.&lt;br /&gt;• As the directions state, pull the skin taught and pull the strip quickly in the opposite direction.  Pulling &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; off of the skin or going to slowly are just going to give you bad results, including bruising and more pain.&lt;br /&gt;• You&#x27;re pulling your hairs out of your body by the root.  It can&#x27;t be painless, BUT if you do it regularly, it will hurt less.  It might be worth it to wax professionally the first time, and then use this product for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;• As other reviewers have said, save your strips from purchase to purchase.  They wash out easily between uses, and can be tossed in your machine, but it is easier on the strips -- and easy to do -- to wash them out in the sink and hang them to dry.  I toss them in a sink with soapy water after use.  The next time I&#x27;m in the bathroom, I rinse them out and hang them over the towel rack.  In a pinch, when I didn&#x27;t have as many, I have found that I can rise them and dry them with the hair dryer really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that this product is water soluble.  Makes for super easy cleanup and allows you to remove product easily if you get it where you don&#x27;t want it.  I also love my epilator, used in combination with Nad&#x27;s.  Both have their advantages.  If you arecomfortable with the concept of waxing, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> Wife said its wonderful, which is a very rare thing, so it must be good.</li>
    <li> i bought it ,but i try to many time,but no results, its painful and removes only 2 or 3 hair at lease ,after my skin was redness ,u need use when it too hot, if too hut burned ur skin,never buy it,save ur money</li>
    <li> I used this product on my chest and stomach, which was a HUGE mistake. Immediately after using it I was covered in red bumps, hairs were missed, and I developed the worst ingrown hairs of my life. This product ruined my skin and my summer. Men, do not use it.</li>
    <li> I used this on my lower legs and instantly got a bruise and it was the most painful experience ever. I have used other waxing products that didnt hurt as bad. I would never use this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nad&#x27;s for a few years and still very happy with it. Great for sensitive skin, easy soap/water clean up.  There&#x27;s never enough fabric strips, so save and wash the fabric from each box you purchase and keep it with the new box and you&#x27;ll have enough.  Does have a great long shelf life, provided you aren&#x27;t redipping, and keep it a consistent temperature during storage.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, but it hurts like HELL..... I kid you not, this stuff really can rip your skin off you like SUPER glue. But then again, what do you expect, you are pulling the root of your hair from your skin. Oh well, i guess it&#x27;s true of what they says, (NO PAIN, NO GAIN!) One suggestion to you folks is, if you are one of those people can&#x27;t tolerate pain or have very sensitive skin, eeeeerrrrr... i think you should stick with the easy safe razor. (because one of my friend who has sensitive, and after she used this stuff for the first time, she looks like she had very bad sun burns, and it was very embarrassing indeed!)   And to people who is trying this stuff for the first time, all i can say is &#x27;good luck and you may want to get some painkiller pills&#x27;, because i think you might need it! Have fun folks!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I use it for my eyebrows and works so well!  No more tweezing for me oh yeah!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be using Nad&#x27;s for the rest of my life, it works so well for waxing my legs and is so easy to use.  I have annoyingly coarse, thick hair on my legs &amp; have to shave every day, yep, major pain.  Nads just rips the hair right out at the root (I know, sounds painful &amp; it is somewhat but it&#x27;s worth it to me &amp; you just get used to it), then I don&#x27;t have to wax again for 2 weeks or more.  But the bad thing is you have to let the hair grow fully before waxing, that kinda sucks.  Won&#x27;t work very well to wax short stubble, at least not for me.  The wax is so easy to prepare, I just stick the jar in a shallow bowl of hot water, don&#x27;t let the water get into the jar.  Then smooth a thin layer of wax on an area of your leg the size of one of the strips, smooth it on in the direction of the hair growth.  Then press it on &amp; tear it off in the opposite direction.  Voila, silky smooth. And when you&#x27;re all done with a leg, the wax just washes right off with warm water, such easy clean up.  It&#x27;s not even really like a wax consistency, more like a thick, clear, green gel. Has a subtle smell, nothing bad. All natural ingredients, another bonus. Here&#x27;s a tip too...the fabric strips that come with the package are ok but they just don&#x27;t give you enough.  What I do is cut up an old pair of jeans into strips, and a couple inches longer than the ones they give you.  Denim fabric works perfect and they stand up well thru washing, the edges will fray but that doesn&#x27;t matter.  I soak them a few minutes in a bucket with warm water  to loosen the wax before throwing in the washing machine.  Please Nad&#x27;s people, never stop making this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Been using for years.  Can no longer find in stores.  Glad to see it on Amazon and setup for delivery.  Easy to use and clean up.  Even started my daughter on it instead of shaving.</li>
    <li> Waxing is my preferred method of removing hair on my legs (epilating works best for my underarms, and I prefer a trimmer for down below), and this is the best waxing system on the market.  I first discovered Nads back when it first came out 10+ years ago and it cost $40!  Glad to see the price has become more reasonable (I&#x27;ve seen it as low as $12 on subscribe and save).  Yes, you do need to heat this up in the microwave for 20 seconds or so.  The thinner it is, the less you use, but be careful not to burn yourself!  I only wax my legs below the knee, not the thighs since that hair is barely noticeable, and one container will usually last three or four waxings (both legs).  I&#x27;ve found that this wax always does a great job at removing all of the hair, and I enjoy the cloth strips as well.  However, they only include 5 strips which isn&#x27;t even enough for one lower leg.  If you order it frequently enough, you&#x27;ll eventually collect enough strips to wax both legs in one sitting.  The wax itself is pretty similar to Sally Hansens Honey Wax [[ASIN:B001510LDY Naturally Bare Honey Wax Hair Remover for Body Wax Women by Sally Hansen, 1 Count]] but the strips in that kit are useless.</li>
    <li> Painful, made my legs bleed.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nads for 3 years and think it is an impressive product.  I hated to shave my legs, underarms, and bikini area due to the inevitable cuts, stubble, and irritated skin that resulted.  I had even let my leg hair grow over the winter because shaving dry skin made the problems even worse.  Professional waxing is way too expensive. Depilatories such as Nair do not work for me. I had remembered the old TV commercial for Nads and decided to give it a try even after reading many mixed reviews online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was astounded at how well Nads worked on all three areas. I felt no pain using it on my legs or underarms -- it just felt like removing a Band-Aid. The bikini area was a different story. It hurt like hell. The skin on my upper inner thighs is \\&quot;jiggly,\\&quot; so it was impossible to hold it completely taut while pulling the Nads strips. I also experienced some bruising there, but it went away in a few days. Nevertheless, Nads removed the hair in all three areas like a dream, and there&#x27;s no sign of it coming back 2 weeks later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic Nads kit is a little pricey but significantly cheaper than professional waxing, and you don&#x27;t need to apply much. Plus, you can reuse the strips once the gel is on them -- just fold the strip in half with the gel inside and then pull apart to reactivate the adhesive properties. I found I could reuse the same strip with gel 2 or 3 times. I also found that heating the gel in the microwave for 15 seconds greatly improved its spreadability. I typically get 5 applications out of one jar. That&#x27;s less than $4.00 a pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is a breeze as the gel is water-soluble. Just use a wet washcloth to remove residual gel from your skin and rinse the strips with warm water. Once the strips are dry, they are ready to be used again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nair recently came out with a similar sugar wax formula that is half the price of Nads.  I tried it, and it is not worth the savings.  The wax is very thin and weak, which makesit impossible to reuse the gel-coated strips.  The wax is so weak that it tends to break off hairs at the skin surface rather than pull them out by the roots.  This leads to many more ingrown hairs than I experienced with Nads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of different products to wax eyebrows, and this one works the best.  I like that the product is no heat and all natural.  I works very well for me, and getting it with the free super saver shipping is a plus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different home waxing products and this is by far the best...primarily because it doesn&#x27;t require heat (though I prefer to warm it up a little) and rinses off with warm water. It comes with re-usable strips, too, which is great because I&#x27;ve found the wax lasts longer than the strips.</li>
    <li> Works well (if you heat it) and excess comes off super easily with water, which is the biggest reason I wanted to try it. Been using Nads for around 11ish years now and haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> Removes hair like advertised. Came with plenty of cloth strips which I soak in warm soapy water afterwards. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn messy! I use newspaper to catch the drip of the very sticky gel. But other than that, it&#x27;s great for hair removal.Although I have to get a friend to help with the armpit area.</li>
    <li> Not easy to use at all. I felt the pain when peeling it off my legs but the hair was going no where.</li>
    <li> I had an old bottle from 2000 and decided it was time to pitch it and buy a new one. I needed to save money on waxing my eyebrows and $17 for a bottle that will probably wax my eyebrows 100 times or more was a bargain! This stuff is the best! My eyebrows look just as good as if I had them done at a salon. I warm the gel for about 12 seconds in the microwave and it seems to be easier to work with. I love that it is all natural, too. I haven&#x27;t used it on any other body part as it would probably be too painful for me. I shave everything else!</li>
    <li> I just wanted the nads.  I love nads,...it works great.  But they sent me accessories.  A VHS tape.  How many people even have VCR&#x27;s anymore.  over 60 dollars for a $20 container or the product and a VHS tape.</li>
    <li> This was a very disappointing product. The wax/gel is very hard and extremely difficult to spread. The directions say nothing about needing to heat the product, but I found I had to keep popping it into the microwave to soften it enough to try to use it. The cleaning pads are so thin, they act like wet tissue and wad up when used - useless. There are only 5 cloth strips enclosed, so that is enough to do almost half of one leg. What a waste! Pass on this one. There has to be something better out there.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this stuff is getting so freakin&#x27; hard to find in stores anymore. Walmart, Target, Safeway, Sally...everybody&#x27;s discontinued it at this size. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and don&#x27;t intend to change brands as long as Australia&#x27;s putting it out there. Best results if you microwave it A LITTLE just to thin it out a bit before applying. LOVE this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love Nads! I used it on my face but it worked great!!! After trying over three different kind of waxing kits, this was heaven sent. Rinses off with water and you don&#x27;t have to hassle with heating it up. It was super quick and easy. I am now a lifetime customer!</li>
    <li> Five years ago, I had a terrible idea. As someone who manually grooms certain areas with just a razor, I thought I could wax myself, for my upcoming wedding night. I&#x27;ve never been waxed by any professionals, but I mistakenly thought I could do it to my most sensitive of areas, myself. I decided on this product. Not positive why; I must have read good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a test run on my shin. It went quite well; it did not hurt to apply, and the pull was not even a little uncomfortable. I was quite happy with the results, and even now I must emphasize that this product is great for legs. Based on this, I decide that I will do &amp;#34;the job&amp;#34; seven days before my wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W-day minus 7. The night of nights. My husband is sleeping soundly, and I prepare in the bathroom. I decide to start with my bikini line, where my thigh meets my torso. I grab the spatula, dip it in the product, pull my skin taut, and start applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret the decision, immediately. The gel pulls on the hairs, causing great discomfort, something I did not experience during the leg test. Figuring that I can still do this, I applied the strip. For several moments, I have to convince myself that I can do this, and despite my fear of inevitable pain, this was still a good idea. I grab the edge of the strip between my thumb and index finger, and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain I felt was exquisite!  Certain that I was actually removing skin from my body, I only pulled the strip half way. Since I still had a wax strip attached to me, I could not see the extent of the damage. Immediately, I hopped in to the shower, and spent 20 minutes slowly removing the strip. After that long work, I could see that I had a very dark red blood blister in the area I successfully waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try waxing at home, kids, particularly if you&#x27;ve never had waxing before. The product did make for some smooth skin for considerable time, but please learn from my naïveté.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It keeps hair from growing back for a long time. I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving my legs!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! It removes hair painlessly without having to heat it up. The good thing about cold wax is u can just rinse off the wax from the wax paper and reuse the papers if ur trying to save money!</li>
    <li> natural good product that does the job of salon waxing at fraction of the cost and you maintain your own cleanliness! I heat it in the microwave and reuse the fabric strips. Easy on the skin and no allergic reactions</li>
    <li> residual wax cleans up very easily with water and a little bit goes a long way. cloth strips can be reused many times.</li>
    <li> Really like that this product doesn&#x27;t need to be heated and the waxing clothes are washable and re-usable. It comes with instructions, wax, plastic applicator and 5 wax off clothes/strips.  Smells great and is really really sticky.  You use this product just like regular hair removal wax and it does safe a little bit on time.  You have to be really careful when applying the wax on current areas of your body and how you place the waxing clothes on the areas you plan to wax as it is really sticky and you could get it all over your hands and other areas around the spots you&#x27;re waxing.  I do find that it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hairs when I&#x27;m waxing, but it&#x27;s due to the length of the hairs, I usually just go back and quickly pluck the hairs left with tweezers.  It&#x27;s really simply to clean the clothes, just run it under warm water and it just washes off the wax and hair and when you&#x27;re done just hang the clothes to air dry. Once you&#x27;re done waxing, you can just quickly rinse the areas that were waxed to get rid of any residue left after waxing.  I personally find that it&#x27;s less painful then regular waxing, it&#x27;s a slight sting and the sting goes away within seconds.  If you&#x27;re tired of having to heat up hair removal wax, give Nad&#x27;s a try</li>
    <li> This is the most effective &amp;#34;waxing&amp;#34; product I have ever used. Not the cheapest but the best.&lt;br /&gt;Pros :&lt;br /&gt;-no heat&lt;br /&gt;-water soluble so it washes off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1)Trim hair to the recommended 6mm length if it has gotten busy. This is particularly important in the Bikini area and it makes it much less painful&lt;br /&gt;2)Save your strips because I feel like they don&#x27;t put as many in the box as you might want.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for over 10 years and it still works as good as it did the 1st day</li>
    <li> I use this product about every 3 weeks to rid myself of unwanted hair. This product does what it says it will. I do have to go over the same area more than once on occasion to get all of the hair. I love that there is no heat and virtually no clean up. Why I knocked off a star- I do wish Nads provided more of the fabric strips-and in this particular product the strips were more like paper- because the strips do not wash very well. (Tip: When I run out I use coffee filters and that works too). Other than that I like this product a lot! Hair type: black coarse</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is simple and easy to use and it&#x27;s all natural so if it gets on anything, it washes right out.</li>
    <li> It was painful, was hard to take off, and din&#x27;t take the hair off like advertised.</li>
    <li> This product sucks!!!! If I could give it no stars I would!!!! Ok the other reviews say follow the directions and you&#x27;ll be just fine it works like a dream, UH WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!! I followed the directions and this stuff left me bruised!!!! Not to mention it hurt worse than anything I&#x27;ve EVER done!!!!!!!! I have tattoos and piercings (so I don&#x27;t consider myself a sissy), and I&#x27;ll tell you, I used this once and never again!!!!! I&#x27;ve used other wax and I was fine!!! I ONLY used this stuff on my legs since they&#x27;re used to this kind of thing, but each strip was agony. The directions tell you that you can re-use the strips with the 2 hairs it pulled out the first time and the pound of flesh on the strip, yeah you can&#x27;t even get one full leg done unless you hand wash the strips that this comes with and wait for them to dry. However you won&#x27;t want to use this again. It&#x27;s sticky and it takes off more skin than hair!!!! I bruised REALLY badly with this stuff, yes I held my skin, even testing a small strip on my boyfriend&#x27;s arm (he asked) and he even bruised. My friend tried it, she bruised too!!! Trust me this stuff takes off more skin than hair. The only way you get some hair (more than two pieces) is pop this junk in the microwave for a while. You have to hand wash the strips which is a pain!!! Oh and you have to put the wax on the strips first!!! What?!! So if you want to get rid of skin and be sticky and bruised then go ahead and buy this! If not then I recommend Zip!!!   *Edited for the non-believers*  Apparently I didn&#x27;t make my self clear. I put this \\&quot;gel\\&quot; on my skin like it said, AND HELD MY SKIN, paid attention to the hair growth rule {apply in the direction growing, take away in the opposite direction for the best results} still excruciating and bruised!!! Tried to put it on the strip, doing the same method, same results. Took off skin and I was bruised! I&#x27;ve been to a professional waxer, did it exactly how they do it. I&#x27;ve even had my best friend (who happens to dothis for a living) help/show (since there are claims I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing) use this evil product, and guess what same results! Still bruised and took off skin. (I&#x27;m wondering if it might be the possibility that I have thick dark hair, instead of thin blonde hair.)So whatever. If you&#x27;re brave go for it. If it works for you, great but obviously from the other reviews I&#x27;m not the only one it didn&#x27;t work for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nad&#x27;s for a few years on my face and think it&#x27;s a great product and really saves time and money.  Much cheaper than going to a salon.</li>
    <li> it was completely dried up. I tried to heat it and it did not soften at all. I have used this product many times and this was completely defective and unusable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad to report that the Nad&#x27;s product received was most definitely a product that someone had already opened and used. The foil wrap holding it in underneath the lid was torn open and resealed,the box it is in is beat up, the wipes are yellowed. I have bought the eyebrow pen of Nad&#x27;s at a local store and the wipes are fresh and the Nad&#x27;s product itself is considerably more pliable. The product in the container I got from this company is considerably thicker and harder to manage applying, nearly solid Nad&#x27;s! ekks! The Nad&#x27;s product itself is FANTASTIC if it is not years old, as it seems this one is :-(</li>
    <li> nad&#x27;s is wonderful for hair removal, especially if you&#x27;re worried about making mistakes. there&#x27;s no heat so you can take your time doing something like shaping an eyebrow (smear a line above or below and use a toothpick to direct hairs into the gel), and it washes off with water so you can start fresh if you mess up. my local drugstores stopped carrying nad&#x27;s so i&#x27;ve been trying other sugar-based waxes and want to scream in frustration each time the wax is too cool for the strip to adhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another bonus of this sugar-based formula is that you can wash and re-use the strips over and over again. i cut the strips into halves, quarters and eighths to have a good range of sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the gel has a good grip on hair if your skin is clean and dry. you can use it for doing the bikini and brazilian areas, though i wouldn&#x27;t recommend the latter without some experience. on the flip side, nad&#x27;s is really tricky to use in hot/humid weather. if your skin is even a little bit damp, the gel won&#x27;t hold very well and you&#x27;ll be left with sticky hairs and a big frown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as of posting, the price for this kit is $20 which is ridiculous - it&#x27;s $12 in most drugstores.</li>
    <li> First off box came banged up and didnt remove hair very well at all and only give you five strips. Followed the exact directions but not smooth results. Thought would be different looking at the reviews but in my opinion was a waste of my money think ill stick with shaving.</li>
    <li> Been using Nad&#x27;s for over five years and still love it!  So easy to use with the results I am looking for.  Happy to find it on Amazon since my drug store now only sells the strips and I didn&#x27;t like those.</li>
    <li> It only really removed about 75% of the leg hair I applied it to and it barely removed 30% of the coarser hair. It used a ton of wax and all of the strips just to do my legs and it didn&#x27;t get anything off my knees. The only place it really worked well was where there were just a few relatively fine hairs like the thighs. Gave me some nasty looking red bumps for about 2 days, but that wouldn&#x27;t have been a big deal IF it actually removed all the hair I applied the gel to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it&#x27;s 2 stars instead of 1 is that it didn&#x27;t hurt that much and it was very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is easy to use, clean up is easy and leaves no hair behind!  Washes off easy.  So much better on large areas than hot wax!</li>
    <li> Used it for &amp;#34;intimate grooming&amp;#34; and it did the job. The trick is to trim first. Washes off clean and I had no irritation. Saved me the embarrassment and cost of a salon waxing.</li>
    <li> I love when I get waxed. I do however, hate when I have to pay a fortune and/or wait to find a person who I like enough to pay said fortune. I tried some wax strips which I reviewed previously and was not impressed. After reading reviews, I thought I would give Nad&#x27;s a try and I think I found a product I will stick with!&lt;br /&gt;This was pretty easy to use, and I loved that I didn&#x27;t need to rush the way I do with heated products. It hurt way less then when I get it done professionally too. I used it on my underarms (my most sensitive area) and my legs and it worked great! Hairless and rash-less. I have used it twice now and I think I am getting better each time I use it. I was able to hand wash the cloth strips and dry them easily. The wax came right off! That went double for cleanup, which was super easy and quick. I do wish that they sold it it larger quantities though so that I could get more use out of it, as I am already almost out. Overall, this was a good product and  I will definitely be be purchasing this again, at my local drugstore where it is cheaper. Love this product and would recommend to anyone who is sick of paying big bucks for waxing salons. My experience was so positive I will keep a lookout for the eyebrow wand, as I would like to try that as well.</li>
    <li> This product has always been a joke. I can remember when it came out and the girls on the infomercial were eating it and then put it on an old lady&#x27;s face. Painless right...I was foolish enough to buy it and yeah it will rip the hair out of your body...i had a bunch of little bloody pinholes coming from my arm but it hurt like crazy. Be for certain that it is going to hurt.</li>
    <li> One word: Sticky.  I prefer the Nads bikini wax product for the nether regions.  I found this product a mess to use.  By the end of it all, my fingers and hands were all sticky, not to mention the areas that I attempted to remove hair.  Imagine maple syrup sticky.  While the instructions say you can reuse the cloth strips, I really found that advice rather dubious and some what gross.  I know other reviewers have praised this product, and perhaps it works better for legs and such, but don&#x27;t use this for your bikini area.  I don&#x27;t recommend that, unless sticky is your thing.</li>
    <li> I had to go over the same spot several times. Maybe my leg hair is too coarse, but this didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
    <li> Didnt do anytbing to me just a mess</li>
    <li> Bought as gift. I recommend this product to anyone who is hairy. Only 8 more words required to finish this</li>
    <li> Nad&#x27;s No-Heat Hair Removal Gel is the best one. I just love it. I have tried everything out and this is the only stuff I will use now, my legs always smooth and I never get any ingrown hairs.  Also, it&#x27;s is not painful as hot waxing.</li>
    <li> For me, Nad&#x27;s hurts way less than other brands such as Veet or Sally Hansen AND it&#x27;s water soluble which makes cleanup a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Best part is its ALL natural, no harsh stinky chemicals! It smells like honey. Great results :) My advice is buy at LEAST (2).</li>
    <li> Does a really good job of removing hair without having to go over it so many times like other products.</li>
    <li> For coarse hair, you should apply a fairly thin layer in the direction of the hair, then place the cloth strip and rub it in the direction of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pull the strip quickly and firmly in the opposite direction of hair growth, while stretching the skin in the opposite direction that you pull the strip.&lt;br /&gt;It is very important to create tension in the skin, or the skin will pull with the cloth and gel, and the hair removal will not be as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on my forearms where I have coarse dark hair, and it removes every hair when I follow the above method.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for years after trying many other hair removal methods, and would never go back to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly on my coarse dark hair - on my legs, bikini area, arms,  and fine hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;And after using it for awhile, it hardly hurts. It takes a few tries to get the method down, but once you get it, you will LOVE Nad&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I really like the fact after waxing with NADS my hair re grow about 2 months.smooth soft legs for summer.</li>
    <li> Being that I have very thick and dark hair on my legs and it grows back within a day of shaving (I have used Veet, but it leaves patchy areas) I decided to use Nads.  I remembered my mom used it for a short while back when I was a kid and it always worked for her and with minimal pain.  I purchased the product at CVS and used it within a week of purchase.  I had a singing competition to attend and the dress I had chosen to wear was about knee length.  The product was hard, almost like liquified gummy bears and did not spread evenly at all.  I placed the removal strip on and pulled against the grain, as it states to do so in the instructions.  The first pull HURT and got maybe 5 hairs, so I tried again and no hair came off.  I figured that maybe I should try a different section of hair and got the same results.  The worst part was not the fact that little to no hair was removed, but I ended up with huge welt like bruises on my legs.  I contacted Nads just after using the product to notify them of the issues I had with their product and they kept asking me if I had read the instructions and which direction I had pulled the cloth strip and then they asked if I had heated the product up; I told them that I did not, as the package stated it was a \\&quot;no-heat\\&quot; product and nowhere in the instructions did it suggest to heat the product up.  I would have taken the patchy look and feel Veet gives me over this painful and useless product.  I would give this zero stars, but Amazon makes you rate at least 1 star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years. It gets the job done so that I don&#x27;t have to shave as often.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I have tried waxing and even a sugar based hair removal that was similar to this, but this is the only one that worked.  Very little redness.  Hot wax would usually leave me with red skin burns from removing the skin, but this attached directly to the hair and was easy to clean up!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Always wanted to try this product and I was happy with it! Much better than wax.</li>
    <li> Best hair removal product I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to waxing so I had no qualms about trying Nads for the first time.  Never again!  This stuff is extremely messy, and didn&#x27;t work well.  Did I mention how MESSY it is?  I had this gel all over my bathroom counter.  Yuck.  Save your money.  I recommend the Sally Hansen wax.  You have to heat it in the microwave, but it&#x27;s easy and very effective.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in the US from because I knew the brand from Australia. I had to warm the wax for 15 secs in the mricrowave. I have to say, i was pleasantly suprised - it was practically painless. I found this wax to be similar to salon quality. I will def buy again and reccomend to all. I read the other negative reviews and suspect that others are using too much wax (it says to only use a thin layer). I&#x27;m guessing this $5 jar will last me a good 6 months if i use it once a month.</li>
    <li> I started with Nads years ago for my legs. After using it for a couple of years the hair has thinned out a lot. Eventually it will stop growing. It&#x27;s a very gentle product to use and is the most effective. It is also easy to clean up because it is water soluble.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and I&#x27;m glad I found it here at Amazon.  It works great. The only problem is that there isn&#x27;t enough cloth stripes to do both legs.  Easy clean up.</li>
    <li> Nad&#x27;s Hair Removal System is a terrific value.  Even paying as little as ten dollars to have upper lip hair removed can add up over the course of time.  I do it myself now with this product and have saved time and money.  Thank you Nad&#x27;s!</li>
