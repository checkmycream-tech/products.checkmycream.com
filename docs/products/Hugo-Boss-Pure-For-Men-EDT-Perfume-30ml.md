<li> Its hard to find in the stores and when you do, its right around $75 for the 2.5 size bottle.</li>
<li> But for some reason the cologne did not last as long compared to when I test sprayed it at the HB store.  </li>
<li> it sustain too short time, even less than 30mins.</li>
<li> It is not strong or lasting.</li>
<li> I had a bit left in my other bottle I bought in the store and now it&#x27;s too late to return this garbage.</li>
<li> It is not too overpowering nor weak,  fragrance last all day.</li>
<li> A very weak smell for me....</li>
<li> If people say it&#x27;s fake he didn&#x27;t even know the difference.</li>
<li> Having been a supervisor of a business here in MN, I know what it&#x27;s like to make mistakes and have customers unhappy with my services.  </li>
<li> Too bad Hugo Boss stopped making it.</li>
<li> it must be fake!!</li>
<li> very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Bf&#x27;s favorite cologne, Gave it to him as a bday gift. No complaints. If people say it&#x27;s fake he didn&#x27;t even know the difference. Smells good, mature. Great for men.</li>
    <li> A wonderful and exciter fragrance, really fantastic!!!!</li>
    <li> The scent is clean and not too strong.  The price was great.  But for some reason the cologne did not last as long compared to when I test sprayed it at the HB store.  But the price was great!</li>
    <li> The scent is extremely light and you literally have to pour it on ur body to get any sense of smell. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it smells like it sounds. \\&quot;pure\\&quot;. very clean, crisp and subtle fragrance. crystal clear and young. for any age.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I wear. Its hard to find in the stores and when you do, its right around $75 for the 2.5 size bottle. The item received was new in the wrapping. You can&#x27;t beat the price. I will definitely continue to buy from this company</li>
    <li> it sustain too short time, even less than 30mins. do u think it&#x60;s real????? it must be fake!! don&#x60;t buy it</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cologne . The price is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne as a present for my husband. Both of us love the smell! He&#x27;s been using Z Zegna and Aqua di Gio for quite some time and I wanted to surprise him with something new. This scent nailed it - light and super fresh.</li>
    <li> I will admit, I had ordered the largest case of Boss \\&quot;Pure\\&quot; cologne and received the smallest case in the mail this afternoon.  However, I called and they were more than helpful.  In fact, friendly, understanding, and cooperative.  Having been a supervisor of a business here in MN, I know what it&#x27;s like to make mistakes and have customers unhappy with my services.  In my mind, a company that can MORE than compensate in times of misplacement and \\&quot;oops moments\\&quot; is a company that earns my respect.  Great people, great services.  Use them.</li>
    <li> the ladies love it.  Seriously, my wife bought this for me many many years ago.  I went through the whole bottle cause its a guaranteed lock for having sex.  Get yourself some.  And stay away from my wife.</li>
    <li> I thought the price was to good to be true, but it wasn&#x27;t. It smells great and the shipping was fast! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I wear this one all the time I would recommend it. People compliment me on this scent and it comes in especially handy on \\&quot;date night\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Wife likes the scent on me....... and it doesn&#x27;t bother me or my allergies.  Too bad Hugo Boss stopped making it.</li>
    <li> My mom had gotten this cologne for me a few years ago and I LOVED the smell, I would wear it all the time.  Recently ran out and since I got an amazon giftcard for christmas, decided it was time to get more!  It has a clean yet indulgent smell to it.  Everyone that I wear it around says it smells great, so it&#x27;s a winner in my book!</li>
    <li> A very weak smell for me.... But it&#x27;s nice to wear.... However, I would not use it for special ocasions....</li>
    <li> The scent diffuses too rapidly.</li>
    <li> smell like real men. a neutral clean fragance</li>
    <li> This product smells like rubbing alcohol. I had a bit left in my other bottle I bought in the store and now it&#x27;s too late to return this garbage. It is not strong or lasting. It just smells like rubbing alcohol and fades in 10 minutes. I did order the newer Boss cologne here: [[ASIN:B000C214A6 B000C214A6]]  and it smells great. Amazon is hit or miss with deals.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes on my husband. It is a very masculine scent without being overpowering. I don&#x27;t like colognes that are musky or smell like tobacco. This is a clean, sexy fragrance!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted- great pricing.</li>
    <li> the sprayer squirts in a big stream</li>
    <li> i bought this for my husband. he had already had one but it was running real low so i bought him another for his birthday. i love the smell of it soooo much its like a present for both of us.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and this is easily my favorite scent for him now! I know he likes it too!  Very manly and not over bearing at all!</li>
    <li> You go through the sample, it became love.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike perfume that has been used until now, this fragrance has become a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, it often uses.</li>
    <li> What a super good deal!!! Nobody else should buy this stuff, because I want it all to myself!!! If they ever stop making &#x27;BOSS PURE&#x27; I&#x27;m going to stink!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Boss Pure for work and I get lots of complements. It is not too overpowering nor weak,  fragrance last all day. I Will continue using this cologne.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to my son.  This is his favorite.</li>
