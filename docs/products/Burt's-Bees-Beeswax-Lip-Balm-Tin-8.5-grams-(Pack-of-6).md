<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you regularly buy the Sticks. Buy these for a much cheaper price and use to refill the sticks for a LOT cheaper than the $3&lt;br /&gt;per stick price!</li>
    <li> Great to find this in the tins instead of the tubes. This is the only lip balm that really works.</li>
    <li> Burts bees is always great! and this is like a clearance price love it !</li>
    <li> I work and play outdoors in all weather.  I don&#x27;t like chapped lips or a pocket full of lip goo.  This solves both problems handily and reliably.</li>
    <li> Burts Bees lip balm is the bomb. This product is truly an amazing product. The tingle and protection is top notch</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax lip balm in this little tin is perfectly formulated.  It has all the natural ingredients necessary to keep your lips in wonderful shape (no chapping whatsoever with regular use) and has a nice herbal scent and a light taste, unlike many of the popular lip balms on the market.  Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm is soft from the moment you the moment you open the tin, unlike some of the \\&quot;adult\\&quot; lip balms out there which contain a ton of paraffin wax, which drags on the lips and can make a chapped mouth scream for mercy.  Until now, you had a choice, with both options seriously lacking.  You could use a \\&quot;kiddie\\&quot; lip balm, which smelled and tasted of bubble gum (as an example) from 20 feet away.  Or you could use the \\&quot;adult\\&quot; version, which had no lingering scent (which is good), but dragged across an already chapped lip, causing more damage than it prevented.  One could also pick the option of no lip treatment at all, but here in the Northeast, that&#x27;s asking for painful bleeding, chapped lips eight months of the year.  This lip balm strikes a beautiful balance between the choices:  a light scent and taste which doesn&#x27;t advertise that you are wearing a lip balm, and powerful protection against the elements.  Sadly, the Burt&#x27;s Bees product contains no sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why do I call it the second best product out there?  Because my tins of this Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm always open in my purse or cosmetic bag, causing a tremendous mess.  I recommend usng the tube version of the product instead.  Actually, I recommend several tubes, because the family members will steal (I meant \\&quot;borrow forever without asking\\&quot;) your Burt&#x27;s Bees the moment you aren&#x27;t looking.</li>
    <li> Its good. Convenient. But you need to keep it warm!! Meant to keep it in the inner pocket of jacket. Else you cant use it. It hardens like a stone. I prefer stick type though they get consumed sooner.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm is awesome.  I have used it for a long time.  But the tin is not available anywhere around here.</li>
    <li> I used to be a hard-core Carmex fan.  I had those little yellow tins stashed everywhere...in my purse, in the car, at my desk, beside my bed.  I couldn&#x27;t go more than a few hours without taking a lip-tingling \\&quot;hit\\&quot;.  Turns out there&#x27;s a reason: the menthol in the Carmex, while good for cold sores, was drying out my lips.  Attempts to give it up only resulted in quivering shakes...and flaking lips.  Enter Burt&#x27;s Bees in the tin.  It gave me the same aesthetically pleasing sensation of applying with my pinky finger, softer than the stick version, with the mint tingle.  And it didn&#x27;t dry out my lips so if I went a day or two without, I wasn&#x27;t left jonesing for a hit!    Thank you Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm in the tin.  You&#x27;ve brought moisture to my lips and balance to my life.</li>
    <li> very good, but bad to use</li>
    <li> The product is very good, next time also to buy, thank you very much for amazon.</li>
    <li> I live in Ireland which has pretty harsh weather. My youngest little girl suffers every winter with raw red marks around her lips which are painful. We tried vaseline - which actually dried out the skin more and we tried Cymex which worked after a day or two but it still left the lips chapped. I picked up a little tin of Burt&#x27;s Bees balm in my local pharmacy and have since been back for more! It&#x27;s great! Lips are instantly de-chapped the marks on my little girl&#x27;s lips - gone almost instantly. So I now have a couple of tins and a couple of the chapsticks as everyone in the family keeps using them!</li>
    <li> I am a Burt&#x27;s Bees fanatic. I keep one in the car, one in the drawer in the living room end table, one in the junk drawer in the kitchen, one in my purse, one on my nightstand, one in my desk at work...I&#x27;ve been known to wake up in a panic at night to use it when I can&#x27;t find the one on the nightstand. I&#x27;ve driven 12 miles at 1 a.m. to the closest 24-hour pharmacy to buy another when I run out in the middle of the night (and no, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s extreme at all. Hey, you like what you like, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is exactly as it&#x27;s always been (no change to the formula - unlike the tubes), but the multi-pack is a WONDERFUL deal. My favorite balm in a 6-pack. And for a bargain! Who can complain?</li>
    <li> Dedicated Burt&#x27;s Bees girl here.  I wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it.  It goes everywhere I do - which results to it being washed more than once but it always survives.</li>
    <li> Love Burt&#x27;s beeswax. Been using it for years but have found it increasingly difficult to locate the tins in stores. The stick has a slightly different formula and doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long. We&#x27;re talking about almost a year if you can believe that! And that is with multiple applications daily.  The tins also are extremely durable. Only reason this gets four stars instead of 5 is that the new tins are more difficult to open compared with previous designs. OTOH, this is a great lip balm that isn&#x27;t too greasy or have ingredients that you can&#x27;t pronounce.  Just some natural</li>
    <li> Works for me....luv this product!</li>
    <li> Been using these for years and they seem to be getting every harder to find. Love the 6 pack because it will literally last for years. Stuff works well, does well in a pocket in the heat (it&#x27;ll melt in your car or dryer tho), and is a relatively natural way to moisturize the lips over putting petroleum products (most chapsticks and vaseline) on your mouth.</li>
    <li> LOVE BURT&#x27;S BEESWAX LIP BALM !!!</li>
    <li> I find I have some sensitivities to certain lip balms; I have no problems with this.  Wish there was a way to get this with with sunblock, but perhaps that is what I am sensitive to...</li>
    <li> I like this version of packaging better than the stick. Same great stuff</li>
    <li> I bought this at a retail store, and want to note two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It tastes like peppermint. I know it&#x27;s mentioned in the online description, but it&#x27;s not stated prominently on the package (but there is mention of peppermint oil in the ingredients list).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) There&#x27;s more in the tin than in the tube, for about the same price. The tin has 0.3oz, the tube had 0.15oz. Both go for about 3 bucks and some change. It&#x27;s a no brainer to go with the tin.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever. No weird artificial smell or feel. I use it every day. If your lips chap easily, carry one of these little tins with you.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm and the slight tingle I get when I put it on at night. Great price for the multi pack.</li>
    <li> So, maybe I should know better, but I don&#x27;t. So, I like the product, but be careful leaving it in a hot car, it melts and then when you try to open it wax/lip balm goes everywhere. Also, it&#x27;s a bit tricky to get the lid off.</li>
    <li> It really protects and it lasts a long time. Haven&#x27;t lost one yet unlike chapsticks which I lose usually 1 every couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I love lip products and was disappointed when I could NO LONGER find at local drug and department stores. As usual Amazon comes through and I stocked up. This product stays on for a good while and the flavor is pleasant.The only downer is that you have to apply with a finger, but, that actually allows perfect coverage. Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know WHAT they are thinking discontinuing the tin (I guess?)  [...] no one in my area has the tins this year - only the tubes.    The tins are SO much better.  I&#x27;ve NEVER used up a tin. Lost some, forgot where I put some, and gave plenty away...but never used one up.  The tubes are much larger in a pocket, they don&#x27;t have any \\&quot;nostalgia\\&quot; to them either, and you can re-use the little tins for pill containers.  (Okay, my grandmother did this...as I never got to the bottom of a tin...but she did. :)    Anyway...one tin in one jacket pocket I know is 3 years old and still half full. (maybe THAT&#x27;s why they changed..those tubes go fast - softer compound too) At the rate I use it...I grabbed 2 6 packs here...and I guess my needs are met for decades to come.  I won&#x27;t be giving away any more of my tins!      This is a small thing in life, but it makes me happy to have found these here... I hope you can get yours, if it&#x27;s important to you.</li>
    <li> As another reviewer mentioned, these are not the all yellow tins pictured.  I find the new tins MUCH more difficult to open then the old ones.  I&#x27;m hoping that with more use they become easier, but the ones I have now are ridiculously hard to get the lid off of if you put it back on too tight.</li>
    <li> After being plagued by chronic chapped lips, I swallowed my manly pride and submitted to lip balms of some sort. However, I refused to use anything that could be mistake as lipstick (chapstick). So I decided to order a couple of these and when I first applied it, tears of humility turned into tears of joy. I love the tingle that the peppermint oil provides. It&#x27;s a very faint smell unlike those obnoxiously scented lip balms and chapsticks. And it&#x27;s all natural too. I think I will be using these from now on.</li>
    <li> As always Burt&#x27;s Bees RULES!</li>
    <li> BURTS BEES IS THE BEST. I use this every day. ,y lips are addicted to this</li>
    <li> But still fell for it :/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title was misleading. Only got 1 and payed for 6. Overall, i&#x27;m pretty sure this was a scam .-.</li>
    <li> Gr8 items. It smells just like honey.</li>
    <li> Great marriage of product and packaging - I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm but having it in the tins is absolutely the best.  First, the tins lay flat in your pocket so they&#x27;re less-obvious than stick-style applicators.  But best of all the cover never comes off by itself so unlike stick-style applicators you don&#x27;t have to worry about what happens if the contents melt or they go through the wash.</li>
    <li> Beats all others plain and simple stock up is my suggestion better than carmex and all those others I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best chapsticks I own.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle worker, but I do really love this stuff.  Hard to open the tin sometimes, but I think you get more ounces in the tin than the stick.</li>
    <li> cute size. Feel cool and refreshing, like mint.</li>
    <li> Caveat emptor! Placed this order with seller: Sellerwholesale777.  Item NOT as advertised! The ad describes this item as \\&quot;.3 Ounce Tins (pack of 6)\\&quot;; but the item received is an oversized \\&quot;gift tin\\&quot; with four .15 oz. tubes of lip balm inside. So, if you think you&#x27;re ordering 6 nice little .3 oz. tins of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, it ain&#x27;t happening. Instead, you&#x27;ll get a giant-sized \\&quot;gift tin\\&quot; sporting an ornamental red ribbon dangling from the rim of the container, with four .15 oz. tubes of various Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm inside. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> Last year, when I was on a business trip to NJ, I bought a lip balm, didn&#x27;t expect it to be so good. Back to china, found that this ships to China, and also not expensive with shipping fee included.</li>
    <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for about 20 years. At that time, they were a small company in Guilford, Maine, selling lip balm in small (yes, even smaller than now) yellow tins. The stuff was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, they have been bought by Clorox and have changed the recipe a few times: the stick is different from the old tin, and the new tin is different from the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for this new incarnation at all. It goes on thickly and makes my lips feel sticky and gooey. It wears off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution has been to give all this new-generation Burt&#x27;s lip balm away and re-order some of the original stuff while it is still available out there. I hope the company will continue to make the old recipe and that Amazon will continue to carry it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.  So glad to have it coming regularly.</li>
    <li> Ordered 6 and received only 1.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I wish they made some with a sun protectant in it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula for this lip balm and it is more waxy and doesn&#x27;t soak in the way the old formula did.  Ok, not great</li>
    <li> Good, I will buy it again later.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve always had problems with petroleum based lip balms. for years, i&#x27;ve been a big fan of burt&#x27;s bees lip balms. the only problem is, these are difficult to find. so glad these are available on amazon at a good price.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend will only buy Burt&#x27;s Bees in the tin, and was having trouble finding these sold in stores, as most people use the stick. He was thrilled to get these as a present, especially in bulk because he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about getting more for quite some time, so you saved him a lot of stress. Cheers!</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees! And so does my husband. He steals them from my purse. So I finally got a multipack to share with him. The only downfall is that they are not individually wrapped, but I&#x27;d still recommend.  You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this lip balm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where do I start,&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t leave your lips looking greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The tin, fits perfectly in the small change pocket of my pants, It&#x27;s part of my everyday carry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-All natural ingredients, if I drink something after applying this I don&#x27;t have to worry about how many chemicals I&#x27;m ingesting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It smells great, like peppermint candy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 tin lasts a very long time, seriously, a loooong time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It does a great job of protecting your lips and moisturizing without looking like you&#x27;re wearing lip balm, your lips look natural</li>
    <li> Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Wax is the ultimate lip balm.  It heals quickly.  I carry a tin of it with me at all times.  The other thing it is good for is chapped upper lip/nose area during a bad cold.  If you wait until your skin is raw it will hurt like crazy for a couple of minutes, but it heals like nothing else.  Just don&#x27;t wait too long and it won&#x27;t hurt to apply.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm is Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm. It leaves your lips feeling soft and protected. There is no fragrance. It has a gentle cooling effect.</li>
    <li> I live in a VERY dry climate, so my whole family suffers cracked lips all winter long. These little tins are truly lifesavers, and I order several 6-packs every year to get us through the season. Even though Burt&#x27;s is now owned by mega-corp, the quality has not suffered. The products are of the best ingredients, and outperform petroleum- based products hands-down.</li>
    <li> My lips tend to be dry at certain times and this baum is the most effective that I have found.  It lasts a long time without a rebound of dryness.</li>
    <li> Nice Lip balm with mint flavor！</li>
    <li> I was having a hard time finding the tins in store, so i decided to order it online. Now ill be stocked up for years! They last forever &amp; when I do run out, ill be sure to order from amazon:)</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff.  My only complaint is that sometimes the little tins can be hard to open.  They also look a little like chewing tobacco.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores so I was pleased to see it on here. Great product and would order it again</li>
    <li> Bought the pack of 6 and left it all over the place, one at the home, one in the car, one at work, a few were claimed by my girlfriend. We both enjoy this product it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No negatives on my part, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months and only used up a small amount.</li>
    <li> Very good.  I have used this for years.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this I did not realize I wasn&#x27;t getting the stick type.  So far no complaints.  It&#x27;s the same quality product and you get a little (very) can to store..........I am not sure what!</li>
    <li> We love Burt&#x27;s bees so this was an easy purchase to add to friends Christmas gifts. Better price than buying individually.</li>
    <li> I used Carmex and swore by it for years...that is until I googled what was in it. Then I found this as a safe alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would suggest you do the same if you use Carmex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny my lips are not as dry as much as they used to be.... Hmmm</li>
    <li> I personally love this lip balm.  It&#x27;s very natural, comfortable, smells wonderful, and I really like the tin.  The tubes are sometimes more convenient, but the tins do have their benefits.  It fits in your pocket a little more nicely.  Plus, what&#x27;s the deal with those tubes?  Sometimes you open the cap and the product is SMASHED into the top after just hanging out in your pocket.  You know what I&#x27;m talking about... It&#x27;s a dreadful tragedy.  Never happens with the tin.  Also, there&#x27;s the washer/dryer incidents.  I find that accidentally washing a tube with my clothes results in a loss of all the beeswax.  The tin actually hold it all in!  Wash it all you want.  Amazing.  I know this from experience.  It&#x27;s easily my favorite lip balm - highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax. I bought a multi-pack so I could have them all around the house (and in the car), for immediate use.  Instantly relieving and definitely convenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most all lip balms on the market.  Burt&#x27;s Bees original never lets me down.  I always come back to them.  Love the tins as they hold more than the tubes.</li>
    <li> The product is smell something, however, it is not bad. And it is hard to use it, I need to use my finger to use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lip balm for 2 years. Obviously, I love it. When I run out I just reorder from the same seller. Always satisfied.</li>
    <li> Second year of purchasing this lip balm for my wife and daughter. They love it. It is quickly becoming a traditional stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of trouble finding these in a store around me.  I did not need 6 but I do really like the tins better than the sticks.  They seem easier for me to slip in my pocket/bag.  Personal preference I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the balm, I like how it tingles and it provides very good protection and moisture in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Wish these were cheaper, I and my sons love Burts Bees lip balm and I am a mini tin collector sooo....</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter.....she loves it.  She has been using this product for years and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> BEST PRICE for Burt&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I personally love this lip balm. It&#x27;s very natural, comfortable, smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, and it&#x27;s become more difficult to find locally. Much better than the tubes.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to puchade this product locally, in the small tin, for a while. Great product east to carry. Love it.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees vs Carmex....no comparision.  Check the ingredients of Carmex and you’ll understand why you&#x27;re always reapplying it (menthol, phenol, etc).  Switched to Burt’s Bees a while ago and will never go back.</li>
    <li> what can I say.. I LOVE this stuff!,</li>
    <li> but not the ones pictured.  The tins that I received were the new kind which are silver with a yellow stamp on the front.  The only reason I mention it is because the news tins do not have as much peppermint in them as the old solid yellow tins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast and the price is good.</li>
    <li> I got two sets of the \\&quot;Pack of six\\&quot; tins for a friend who loves this stuff. (I love it too, just not as much as she does)... This was a belated xmas gift and then they arrive and all the tins are unsealed!  This is a cosmetic product, people!  Now she&#x27;s going to have to return them for me and I feel like an ass.  Thanks! :-(</li>
    <li> I think all BB products are outstanding. I really like the small tins better than tubes.  I carry in my front pocket and I&#x27;ve never had one of these come open or get stuck up on the lid like the tubes seem to do.</li>
    <li> My local grocery store stopped selling lip balm tins of any brand or style, which really ground my gears.  I think it&#x27;s because unlike tubular lip balm that has to be replaced every month or two, these tins last eight to ten months!  I first discovered Burt&#x27;s Bees back in 2000, and have loved the brand ever since.  I like the tins, because I think they&#x27;re more versatile in application.  Beeswax lip balm is far more natural than some other brands, and I feel like it works better.  I like that I found a six pack of these tins.  They&#x27;ll last me several years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees .3oz tins since 1999, and haven&#x27;t complained since.  Non-greasy, convenient, and more pocketable than tubes, this is, by far, my favorite lip balm.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s good，and distrbute my colleague as a gift</li>
    <li> Fantastic fantastic fantastic product! For some reason I have trouble finding lip balm that works. I find I have to constantly reapply throughout the day. Not with Burt&#x27;s! Once or twice a day is all it takes to keep my lips moist. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Great deal on a hard to find items in the brick &amp; mortar stores lately.  The package arrived on time.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Just purchased it and I love it. However, I never realized how small the package is. At least my dog shouldn&#x27;t be able to eat through the tin. :)</li>
    <li> Used to find these little tins at the Cracker Barrel down the road, cant do without. A must for winter. The best and easy to carry</li>
    <li> I have a tin in every bag, at the office, and in my coat pocket!</li>
    <li> I share these with my friends all the time. I have both the chapstick tubes and these tins.  Can&#x27;t go wrong if you have too many.</li>
    <li> This item was discribed perfect. It was exactly as anticipated, just what I wanted. Thanks again for the great product.</li>
    <li> Works great. It&#x27;s easier to order on-line than drive all over trying to find this product. I like the 3 oz. tin container but also the plastic tube works great</li>
    <li> This lip balm has saved my lips quite a few times! It smells nice, doesnt have a taste (it doesnt make you lick your lips), and the tin recipient is easy to slide in a purse or a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;Do not leave in the car in the sun: it will melt, and may make a mess!</li>
    <li> Have been buying this product for years, love it.  Easy to fit in a pocket when traveling, goes on smooth, has a pleasant aroma.  Keep my lips moist, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm.  I like the way it tingles.</li>
    <li> I bought the 6-pack so I&#x27;d have a couple tins to myself after giving away the others as Christmas gift bag stuffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it works well as a balm, but I do find it just a bit difficult to open and apply the balm from a quite small tin with my large hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as it is a tin, it&#x27;s durable enough to be in your pocket with keys and such without worrying about problems like the cap coming off or a tube unscrewing and smushing the balm into the tube-cap and really annoying you. That&#x27;s a nice difference.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a pamper-me jar to give to teachers, grandmothers, and friends. They were just perfect. I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and the tin gave the jar that little extra.</li>
    <li> good fast service, excellent product.</li>
    <li> Would have been 5 stars, however this six tins is way more that I could ever use in a year...</li>
    <li> Better value than the stick, just not as convenient.</li>
    <li> MUST HAVE -  ez in the pocket or the purse CHEAP</li>
    <li> my partner is addicted to this stuff. she doesn&#x27;t leave the house without it. she refuses to use anything else.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is the way to go for your skin-care products! I exclusively use this lip balm all year round. There are no other brands that even come close to the coverage and softness from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> Do not buy!!! This is not a pack of 6 as described.  It is one. Only one. And the seller will not make good on the error.  Buyer be warned.</li>
    <li> Best of the best. Not sure ? Read the ingredient list. All good for you ingredients so you can feel good about things. Used it for years and love the round tin version.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and this is no exception.  Got these for thank you gifts for a Mommy-to-Bee themed baby shower.  Everyone loved them.  Great price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I stock up when I can because I can&#x27;t find them in stores. They are a perfect fit for the 5th pocket in my jeans. And it really feels good on dry lips.</li>
    <li> Not convenient to paint lips. Use finger ?</li>
    <li> I have loved this product for years, and I like these thin round tins.  I cannot find the tins in stores any more, I believe they have stopped making them.  You can only buy it in tubes now, which are too bulky in my pocket.  Thank goodness I found some here!</li>
    <li> ...it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same formula as in the sticks of balm.  The stick has a cooling effect, almost tingly (which I really like), but this stuff does not.  Still, it seems to work as well in banishing rough lips.  Love our Burt&#x27;s Bees Balm!</li>
    <li> I like the way they fit in mu pocket as oppsoed to the tube style.  Hard to find in stores in my area.</li>
    <li> This stuff is better than carmax lip care because of the peppermint cooling sensation.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find these tins in the store, hubby has to have this kind. Great bargain too. Glad  I found them.</li>
    <li> This came quick. This type of container usually needs to get used a few times before it gives off enough lip balm. It goes on invisible and has a subtle peppermint flavor.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I had chapped lips really bad before starting to use this.  I started using this about 10 years ago and I have never had a problem since.  I have one to take with me when I go out, one by each computer, and one by each chair.  I have the same lip balm in the tin on my bedsiide table, and put some on before I go to bed at night.  I don&#x27;t know of any of my friends that don&#x27;t use it and love it too.  I couldn&#x27;t wear even Clinique Lipstick without it drying my lips, although I was able to wear their make-up without any problems.  I also love the beginning story of how Burt&#x27;s Bees was started.  I hope whereever he is, he&#x27;s doing something he loves.  I highly recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I like the tins because they slip into a front pocket of my jeans without bulging.  I also like the fact that I can get every single bit of lip balm out of a tin, whereas with a tube there&#x27;s always some left in the bottom that is just wasted.  Plus the tins are just so darn cute.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm!! I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Lip Balm year round and it&#x27;s the best. I have tried most of the other brands and they don&#x27;t compare to Burt&#x27;s. Best price on Amazon..</li>
    <li> I think the stuff in the little tins works better than the stuff in the twist tube. Keeps me from getting chapped lips in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife applies this with her finger. I apply it by rubbing the tin on my lips; think of how you would eat an apple, but hold the tin in your fingers instead.</li>
    <li> I have lived in Minnesota since 1985 and keeping your lips healthy in the winter is no easy chore. I started with Chapstick, moved to Carmex (terrible!) then onto Lip Medex before I found the cure which is Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm. I swear by this stuff so much that my jeans have little circles wearing out of the pockets from where I keep my .3 oz tins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Salve. Great for chapped hands and faces! Works wonders!! http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Hand-Salve-Tin/dp/B00014D5O8</li>
    <li> Always carry on of these with me and use it often. Stays put and keeps lips soft and subtle.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> My favorite lip balm. Excellent product and can&#x27;t beat the price over the drugstore tubes. Right amount of menthol, softens easily. Great for dry elbows and knuckles too. Don&#x27;t get it around your eye, though!</li>
    <li> Minty and refreshing! Obviously gets on your hands, so if you don&#x27;t like that, get a stick. Pack of 6 is perfect for storing in pockets, pencil bags, or wherever else you need them. And for when you accidentally lose a couple ;P</li>
    <li> it feels smooth and  wet.i like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the 6 pack for less than the price of 1 tin at the department store.</li>
    <li> Hands down, best lip balm out there. No camphor, which messes with your lips in the long run, and very mild but still very effective.</li>
    <li> This comes with the original almond oil formula which works better for us than the newer formula with sunflower oil. We LOVE these.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lip balm!!!  Once I tried this stuff, I have yet to find a comparable product.  The lip balm in the &amp;#34;tins&amp;#34; is different than the same &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; product which is why I buy the tins.  I used to be able to purchase the tins in the store and haven&#x27;t been able to find any recently.  I was THRILLED when I saw this online and is cheaper than what they were in the store.  This stuff is amazing, as well as other Burt&#x27;s Bees products that I have tried.  LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees!!!</li>
    <li> nice lip balm.  Not fruity or sweet.  Excellent moisturizer.  Only the price keeps me from giving it 5 stars, but for some people, the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> 20 years of using and nothing else.</li>
