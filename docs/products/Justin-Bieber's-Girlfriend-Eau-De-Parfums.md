    <li> My daughter loved this! Great Price for the size</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, great service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for the past few years and I&#x27;m always buying a new one after I run out. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just for young tween girls but for any age for a lady, I&#x27;m nearly 18 and I continue to use it almost daily and I get compliments on it all the time! Plus the bottle is very pretty, looks so nice on display! Also the scent lasts almost all day for me, I&#x27;m not much of a perspiratory so I don&#x27;t need to reapply at all, it lasts until I shower later that night of use!</li>
    <li> This was a 13th birthday gift and my granddaughter was delighted. The packaging and the scent were both big hits. I&#x27;m not much of a Bieber fan but then I didn&#x27;t buy it for me.</li>
    <li> This was the favorite gift and a hit with my Grandaughter! She looked and smelled wonderful! The packaging and itme is exactly as were presented in the photo.</li>

    <li> This was a Christmas gift my daughter asked for. If priced it in other places and was super excited to ind it here for such a a competitive price. She was ecstatic!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells like someone s*** in the toilet and said it was perfume. The perfume smells like a garbage dump and it is awful.</li>
    <li> Prompt, and exactly what was expected! Very well made!</li>
    <li> I love the scent. Very nice!</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong with anything with the Justin Bieber name. Girls very happy. I like the scent too.</li>
    <li> I bought this parfum for my daughter and was delightfully surprised at how good it smells.... Its a light fresh scent that isnt overwhelming and is very appropriate for a young girl..</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a 16 year old. I gave it 4 stars because I do not think any product that is directed toward teenagers should be this expensive. It does smell pretty good and she loved it but I would never buy this just to buy it. It was for xmas and so I paid that price for it.</li>
    <li> My youngest daughter is a huge fan of Justin Bieber, she wanted this as a Christmas gift and I have to say it does smell pretty good.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter went wild when she received this.</li>
    <li> I love this because my youngest grandaughter loves this product.  I found this on Amazon for her and know she will be so pleased when she opens it for Christmas.  The younger set is fasinated with Justin Bieber and want to try all his products...this is one whe has used before and favors greatly.</li>
    <li> Great! Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not as great smelling as the first one. But still loved by my daughter. Great gift idea. Most girls love it</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected and a great price!</li>
    <li> My 12 yr old daughter loved it !!! She was so excited to be one of the first girls to have it!</li>
    <li> what can you say when you buy anything Beiber for a 13 year old...she is getting this for graduation  next week...but she has asked for it in the past....great seller  will buy again</li>
    <li> Best scent ever. Love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. I love Jb &amp;#60;3 It was a great price for such a great item. I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase it for so long!</li>

    <li> this smells good , its sold at a great price and made a great gift. i will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> She loved it. Thank u.</li>
    <li> Even though I hate Justin Bieber and hate the bottle, this smells pretty good. A little more expensive here on Amazon, if you have a TJMaxx around you, I would recommend buying it there.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product as a christmas gift for my little sister, ugh justin bieber, but she loved it. I reccomend it, good deal.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. I know my daughter will be wearing this everyday. I hope it lasts so I won&#x27;t have to get another one too soon</li>
    <li> This scent is nice but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t stay for long...if applied in the morning...its gone by lunchtime.  Wish the scent would linger longer.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> My girl likes it but I don&#x27;t. I told her Justin Bieber Smells like alcohol so I might as well buy her a bottle of Jack Daniels if she want to smell like Bieber!</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter, who&#x27;s a HUGE Justin Bieber fan.  She&#x27;s been talking about this perfume for a while now, so I thought it&#x27;d be a GREAT holiday gift.  The price through Amazon.com was the cheapest I&#x27;ve been able to find, &amp; they shipped it out VERY QUICKLY!  My daughter was SO EXCITED when she opened this on Christmas day, as she didn&#x27;t expect to get it!  We had priced it at some local retailers recently, &amp; the price was at least $20 more than what I got it for on Amazon.com. The spray bottle itself is quite ornate, &amp; I&#x27;m sure adds quite a bit to the cost of the perfume.  That being said, it still looks REALLY COOL!  Surprisingly, it actually smells pretty good too.  My daughter&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy!  A GREAT purchase!  Thanks again Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas, and I must say, it&#x27;s awesome! The packaging is really unique, and the smell is great. It&#x27;s a light scent so you can wear it every day, but it smells nice all day long.</li>
    <li> I was actually plesantly surprised by this scent.  This was the first time my niece (16 y/o) asked for a perfume and I was a little skeptical about buying it before checking it out in the store.  It&#x27;s not overpowering.  Very appropriate for a young lady and the bottle is adorable.  She was very happy to get this for Christmas and I was happy that Amazon had it for a great price!</li>
    <li> I got this Perfume for my daughter on her birthday and she loves it. She is only 11 and I was afraid that it would smell too &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; but it doesn’t its perfect for preteens.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect gift for a teen girl. (A friend of my daughter&#x27;s.)  She LOVES it!  It&#x27;s expensive though.</li>
    <li> The girl who received it said it smelled the same as Bieber&#x27;s previous perfume &amp; I agree.  A bit expensive for what it is.  The packaging gets an A+,  I give it 3 stars because it seems they only repackaged the product.  Everything arrived on time.</li>
    <li> LLLL OOOO VVVVVVV EEEEE  IIII TTTTTTT...again all may.daughtters friends loved the smell  tooooooo....she really like the bottle for her JB perfume</li>
    <li> My niece was thrilled with the perfume!!</li>
    <li> I teased my 13 year old for wanting this perfume, but I was suprised when she got it....it smells fantastic!  It is a sweet smell, but not too sweet.</li>
