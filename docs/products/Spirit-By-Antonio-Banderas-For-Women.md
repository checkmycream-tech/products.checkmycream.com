      <li>TRUST ME! :)</li>
      <li>i love it its all i use</li>
      <li>I was also hesitant to wear this as it seems to be much more musky</li>
      <li>I definitely love the way she smells.  </li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for better service.</li>
      <li>My husband and son love the fragrance on me:)</li>

      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>&amp; I love it</li>
      <li>so well or that receives so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Spirit.</li>
      <li>and I was so thrilled after receiving it as it is really cheap as compared to how much I originally buy it.  </li>
      <li>It worries me that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be widely available in stores anymore, because every time I&#x27;ve ever found a scent I like, and have made it my signature scent, the manufacturer stops making it.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume so much!</li>
      <li>Thank you very much for the quality of the product is good and I highly recommend it, just continue like delivering quality products and competitive.</li>
      <li>On a hunch, I chose Spirit by Antonio Banderas because I thought a latino male would approve a good smelling scent.  </li>
      <li>Not sweet like most of my perfumes, but very sexy.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying, I would happily pay twice as much for it, but besides just smelling totally yummy, it&#x27;s inexpensive as well!</li>
      <li>I got exactly what I wanted!  </li>
      <li>I get compliments alot on this fragrance,I really enjoy perfume and this along with white linen and channel #5 are my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this old product.</li>
      <li>or my memory of a cologne I liked prior to my loss of smell.  </li>
      <li>This was such an easy order!  </li>
      <li>first time when I bought I was loved!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
      <li>I first bought this at Walgreens and it is still one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells, it smells terrific, I have gotten compliments and my friends all want to have it.</li>
      <li>but this is something to be checked not unless my body got sensitive too much on its strong fragrance</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to find such a large bottle for such a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Perfumes, Eau De Toilette, etc are a matter of personal choice, this one is fresh, floral and not too sweet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Spirit is a nice alternative to all the sweet smelling celeb scents out there, but it&#x27;s missing the WOW factor to make it me buy it again.</li>
      <li>I Love this fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Is soft and discrete but noticeable enough and lasts very well!</li>
      <li>, it went straight in the trash.......</li>
      <li>She got hooked on it years ago when you could still pick it up cheap in a local discout store.  </li>
      <li>This bottle just doesn&#x27;t seem to have much scent.  </li>
      <li>Smells really good and the size was bigger than i had expected.</li>
      <li>I will continue to purchase this cologne as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>I hope that it will stay available for a long time here.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend</li>
      <li>I buy different perfumes pretty regularly, but I keep coming back to Spirit as my all time favorite.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is too big to carry in your purse, so I just make sure I am careful with it.</li>
      <li>True enough after a day or so ... I got rashes in my back where I sprayed the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The color is almost clear, I don&#x27;t know if that has something to do with it?</li>
      <li>/&gt;But the smell of it is worth losing a little.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is a quality product that fits the ph of my wife, by the experience with the product I recommend this brand</li>
    <li> I love this perfume so much! But for some reason it is getting difficult to find. I am very happy with the service I received and would absolutely buy from them again. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Friday, September 10, 2010 - I ordered another bottle of perfume... again, I was very happy with the service. It arrived under the estimated date of delivery and in perfect condition. I will continue to shop from AAA Merchants for my Spirit by Antonio Banderas!</li>
    <li> I got this product and I was so thrilled after receiving it as it is really cheap as compared to how much I originally buy it.  Problem is when I tried using the product ,  I got rashes a day after to the area where I sprayed it.  I thought I got the rashes from the food that I  ate so  ignored the thought.  The next time around I sprayed it in my back having the idea that it could be this perfume which has caused me the rashes.  True enough after a day or so ... I got rashes in my back where I sprayed the perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find my receipt as I intend to return this .  But please be cautious.  I could be wrong but instances had made it clear for me.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a year and it is only this time and with this product that came that I got the rashes. Strange but this is something to be checked not unless my body got sensitive too much on its strong fragrance</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! It works so well with my own scent that the blend is fabulous and brings on the compliments! ;)</li>
    <li> This was such an easy order!  I got exactly what I wanted!  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent, when I wear it I get so many compliments!  Although this recent purchase is very disappointing. I received very old product, one bottle is bronze in color and the other is very pale pink like being watered down. The lids are on so tight it&#x27;s like they were jammed on! The boxes show their age. Needless to say I will not be ordering from this company again.</li>
    <li> AB Spirit is a very pleasant, well-blended, light unoffensive floral musk. It doesn&#x27;t wear like an oriental on me, in spite of the classification. It dries down to more of a skin scent, likely due to the musk, which my skin just luvvvvs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spirit is a nice alternative to all the sweet smelling celeb scents out there, but it&#x27;s missing the WOW factor to make it me buy it again.</li>
    <li> OMG!  I LOVE LOVE THIS PERFUME!!! SMELLS SO GOOD!!!  YOU COULD ONLY FIND IT HERE! TRUST ME! :)</li>
    <li> Love this old product. Hard to find in stores. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> My husband and son love the fragrance on me:) I do too!😊</li>
    <li> I severed my olefactory nerves many years ago and one of the things I miss most is the smell of a good cologne.  I now have to rely on others, family members, etc. or my memory of a cologne I liked prior to my loss of smell.  On a hunch, I chose Spirit by Antonio Banderas because I thought a latino male would approve a good smelling scent.  Well, I have had nothing but compliments, from men AND women.  I will continue to purchase this cologne as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> This is one of my sister&#x27;s favorites.  She got hooked on it years ago when you could still pick it up cheap in a local discout store.  Now it is getting harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister requested this for her birthday and I found it on Amazon. Since she and I have like tastes in perfume, I thought I would like to try it too, so I bought two bottles and kept one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful smelling eau de toilette. I am glad I bought myself one.  My sister was really happy I found it for her.  There is just one issue.  I noticed when the bottles arrived one was leaking a little, so I kept that one and gave her the other one.  When she opened it, hers was leaking a little too.. hence the 4star rating rather than a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the smell of it is worth losing a little.  The bottle is too big to carry in your purse, so I just make sure I am careful with it.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells, it smells terrific, I have gotten compliments and my friends all want to have it.</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this for her birthday,she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;She said she gets compliments at work when she wears it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much,&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
    <li> I love perfume and was silly enough to buy this based on the reviews it had? I wish I hadn&#x27;t bothered, it went straight in the trash.......I love perfume but this was cheap and nasty.</li>
    <li> I have been using this scent for years, it is my favorite.  This bottle just doesn&#x27;t seem to have much scent.  The color is almost clear, I don&#x27;t know if that has something to do with it?</li>
    <li> Great price for my favorite fragrance!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a gift after she&#x27;d been looking for it in local stores. I&#x27;d never heard of it before that. It smells heavenly on my wife. She&#x27;s happy with it. I definitely love the way she smells.  I would rate it up there with other high-end perfumes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on a total stranger.  I loved the way she smelled when she came into our office.  This is either a knock off or she lied about what she was wearing.  I did pass it on to a neighbor who said she likes it.</li>
    <li> I buy different perfumes pretty regularly, but I keep coming back to Spirit as my all time favorite.  It smells AMAZING and I get compliments and people wanting to know \\&quot;What kind of perfume is that?!\\&quot; every time I wear it.  Definitely worth buying, I would happily pay twice as much for it, but besides just smelling totally yummy, it&#x27;s inexpensive as well! :)  I LOVE this perfume!</li>
    <li> I get compliments alot on this fragrance,I really enjoy perfume and this along with white linen and channel #5 are my favorite.I love Spirit.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! I have been buying this one from the beginning and I get compliments all the time. I just wish I could still buy in store. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this one!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good buy. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this perfume for years,  I love it.  It&#x27;s one of my favorites.  I bought it years ago and it was no longer sold in my store.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume. I&#x27;m so happy to find such a large bottle for such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I first bought this at Walgreens and it is still one of my favorites. I get compliments every day. My daughters love it too!</li>
    <li> This to me is the best perfume ever made. It is so awesome. I just love this and get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff.  in fact, I will be ordering some more.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and the size was bigger than i had expected.</li>
    <li> Love it! It is not strong when it dries.</li>
    <li> this eau de toilette smells complete different like before...  first time when I bought I was loved!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not feeling well .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I get it for my mother every year...she loves it and it&#x27;s cheaper than other sites. 5/5</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite. I got these years ago in a local discount store. I totally forgot about this one until I was searching cologne for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful smell, it last all day and I get compliments all the time. I love Antonio Banderas products even my husband is using his cologne. I am glad I bought it for myself. Hopefully they don’t discontinue the product that would be a bummer!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume!!!  I&#x27;ve been wearing it exclusively for about 5 years now and I constantly receive compliments on the scent, from both men and women.  I used to buy it locally, but for the past couple years have had difficulty finding it locally and so have purchased from this seller on Amazon.  It worries me that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be widely available in stores anymore, because every time I&#x27;ve ever found a scent I like, and have made it my signature scent, the manufacturer stops making it. Please, please, please do not stop making this perfume - I can&#x27;t imagine ever again finding a scent I like so well or that receives so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been pleased with the delivery time and the product from this seller and have not experienced any problems requiring customer service.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t given this to my girlfriend yet because it&#x27;s part of gifts for her birthday in September but I smelled it on a female coworker &amp; I love it so my girlfriend will love it.....</li>
    <li> Perfumes, Eau De Toilette, etc are a matter of personal choice, this one is fresh, floral and not too sweet. I Love this fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Is soft and discrete but noticeable enough and lasts very well!</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume and consistantly get good comments on how I smell. I hope that it will stay available for a long time here.  It is a great value and I love it and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything.. I have tried to stray and it just doesn&#x27;t work. I always come back to this.  The shopping experience is the best I have ever experienced and it always gets to me so quickly!! couldn&#x27;t ask for better service.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned when I opened the box and the bottle was leaking a bit. I was also hesitant to wear this as it seems to be much more musky/spicy then I remember. After spraying it on my wrists just now and letting it sit for a moment, I am now super happy that I received this! It&#x27;s settled into a beautiful light musk with a hint of vanilla on my skin. Not sweet like most of my perfumes, but very sexy. But yes, my bottle is slightly leaking as well. Must be the design of it.</li>
    <li> The cap on the bottle was broken, so it was not usable.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance.  I wear it every day but sad that I can&#x27;t get it locally any more.</li>
    <li> Greetings I am writing to tell you that I am very comfortable with the product, packed all my expectations. thank you</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this scent - it&#x27;s feminine without being flowery and overpowering, and always seem to receive compliments when I wear it out.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for the quality of the product is good and I highly recommend it, just continue like delivering quality products and competitive.</li>
    <li> Still loving this scent after all these years</li>
    <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for myself.  I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for years and love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume ....smells so good,I&#x27;m so happy I found it in Amazon.😊</li>
    <li> i love it its all i use</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> wife and i both love it</li>
