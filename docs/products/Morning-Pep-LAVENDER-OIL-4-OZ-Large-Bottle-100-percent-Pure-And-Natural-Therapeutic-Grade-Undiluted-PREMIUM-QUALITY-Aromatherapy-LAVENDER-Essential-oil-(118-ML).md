<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This natural lavender essential oil is distilled from the flowers of the true lavender plant, Lavandula angustifolia, formerly L. officinalis, and it has a heady fragrance dominated by clean piney and sweet floral notes. This particular distillation has a pleasant powdery undernote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender has been used as a fragrance, a flavoring, and for medicinal purposes continuously from prehistorical times and is still is widely used in fragrances for both men and women as it is so very versatile and appealing. It is my favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender oil is rich in terpenes and should be diluted in a carrier oil such as sweet almond oil before topical use, as in massage or aromatherapy. I use lavender essential oil almost daily, spritzed into the air and on bed linens, in hot bathwater, dripped into the pool of wax on a candle, or added to a misting diffuser, and find the scent to be very calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is packaged in a 4 fl. oz. (118 ml) amber bottle with a safety-sealed cap and an attractive label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning Pep provided essential oil for evaluation and review.</li>

Can rid hair of unwanted visitor&#x27;s plus please hair loss suffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It will help boost up boring smelled cleaning product&#x27;s but dilute with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Apply this to you if want stress relieved out of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.To give fresh smell of sheet&#x27;s add it to make the night&#x27;s sleep filled with flower blossoming scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.I feel like a new person once sniffing this natural lavender&lt;br /&gt;my eye&#x27;s rolled back up in my head all will benefit from this kind but if you&#x27;ve would like other choice&#x27;s Morning Pep sell&#x27;s ( Natural peppermint ) ( Natural eucalyptus) ( Natural lemon ) ( Natural lemongrass ) ( Natural orange ) ( Natural rosehip seed ) ( Natural rosemary ) ( Natural tea tree ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It&#x27;ll make stinky diaper smell disappear on the spot.🌷&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s extra&#x27;s to read below V&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;For use in aromatherapy and other applications.

    <li> [[VIDEOID:afba1aa7d107df4ce63e680eaf88255b]] Lavender is one of nature&#x27;s sweet smells and one scent I really like.  This is good quality pure oil that is a perfect relaxing scent and really smells great and makes a great air freshener when added to my diffuser.  This can also be added to the bath, put directly on the skin or used in the laundry.  I use this as a relaxing scent before sleeping with just a bit under my nose.  There are several other uses for lavender as well, some of which I am just learning about, such as an insect repellant.  Unfortunately MP does not include any droppers with their oils but that is a minor issue with me as this is a nice large bottle at a good price (currently 8 dollars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful! Great quality, great value. Try Lavender Lemonade. It&#x27;s yummy and pretty.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
    <li> The Lavender oil does not seem to be of a very good quality. The bottle is not labeled by its Latin name,it is just labeled Lavender.It does not come with any stopper or dropper. It is a large bottle with a cap only. It has a nice smell , however it does burn my skin when applied neat. I will use it to make the house smell nice but will never use on my skin again. I will not order this again. It was a waste of money for an essential oil.</li>
    <li> I can not even begin to share with anyone just how much I love lavender...in all of its forms. You can easily read the product description to see all of its benefits.  I love it and use it daily purely for its sleep properties.  I can not fall into bed at night without spraying lavender spray on our sheets and pillowcases.  I mix this oil with water...I know...oil and water aren&#x27;t supposed to mix...but this works for me!  I spray soft flannel pieces of cloth and tuck them in drawers, under mattresses and anywhere where I want a soothing calming relaxing aroma!  I truly love this scent!&lt;br /&gt;My product was sent to me by the manufacturer for my honest thoughts!</li>
    <li> Everybody knows lavender as the sweet-smelling bubble bath after a hard day&#x27;s work, but what you may not know is that lavender oil can also be beneficial for skin health. Lavender fights bacteria in a gentle, non-irritating way which makes it a great alternative to harsh acne peroxides. It leaves my skin smelling great, feeling soft, while reducing redness and breakouts. I use it mostly as a facial treatment but it smells so delicious that I also add a few drops to bath water. It is very potent and can make the whole bathroom smell like a field of flowers. My only complaint about this Morning Pep brand is that the bottle does not have a dropper so it is very difficult to pour out a small amount. I have to reduce one star for that. Otherwise, I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality, price and size of bottle. Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample was provided for the purpose of this review.</li>
    <li> Very fragrant, felt great. Per wiki, Lavender oil is an essential oil obtained by distillation from the flower spikes of certain species of lavender. Has great effects and is said to give a soothing and clears anxiety. A sample was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Came in earlier than said! Smells different than pure lavender (Possibly mixed with another?) Overall great! Smaller bottle than expected.</li>
    <li> I love this lavender oil. You can use it for many different things, but I just like to use it as aroma to relax most of the time. It has strong nice smell.</li>
    <li> nice scent for a good price</li>
    <li> The price is very good for this size bottle but as other reviews have noted, this oil might be blended with something else. I used it for aromatherapy and it doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender. The label doesn&#x27;t specify the Latin name of the lavender variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked several other people and they all separately thought the smell was off.  It is also not as strong as other brands like Aura Cacia or Now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased the item at full price. Unlike many, many other reviewers, I did not receive any discounts or samples.</li>
    <li> There is exactly one essential oil that I am never without.  Lavender.  There was a time that I suffered from terrible migraines, often lasting several days.  Then 20 years or so ago, in the midst of a horrible migraine that had lasted 3 solid days, one of my daughters who was experimenting with making natural cosmetics at the time decided to make me a face mask to help me relax - 1 tablespoon of green clay, the juice of half a lemon and 4 drops of lavender essential oil.  Twenty minutes later the migraine was gone - and I&#x27;ve never had one since that lasted longer than to mix up a mask or put a drop of lavender oil under my nose and wait twenty minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve discovered a multitude of uses for lavender oil.  Some of my favorites -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶︎  Add 3 or 4 drops to your bath for instant relaxation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶︎  3 or 4 drops added to the rinse cycle of your laundry makes a lovely fabric freshener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶︎  Warm a drop or two in your palms, then run your hands through your hair for extra shine - or over your pillow.  Many swear that inhaling the scent while you sleep makes for a better night&#x27;s sleep&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;▶︎  I keep a small mist diffuser in my bathroom.  Three drops of lavender oil added to the water gives 8 hours of air-freshening power at much lower cost than those name-brand plug-ins I am so allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steam diffused from fresh flowers, this 4 ounce (118 ml) bottle  of [[ASIN:B00W69DNTI Morning Pep 100% Pure And Natural Lavender Essential Oil]] is a great buy.  Do NOTE, however, that  this bottle does not have a dropper top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 -  Nothing is more soothing &amp; calming than the scent of lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided</li>
    <li> Excellent quality 100% pure Lavender Oil. Comes in a glass bottle, darkened to protect the contents from light, with a tightly sealed stopper. Clearly designed for safe long term storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have several Morning Pep products, including a similar 4 Oz bottle of Peppermint Oil which is also an excellent product. Everything from Morning Pep has been healthy, free from additives, very good quality &amp; seems to be made with care and mindfulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pure Lavender Oil, and it&#x27;s pleasantly intense. A few drops goes a long way. Very high quality oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. I really genuinely like this, and I&#x27;m increasingly impressed with this company. They sell good products. It&#x27;s refreshing to see a product where there&#x27;s nothing I would change, it&#x27;s everything it claims to be, and no complaints. Excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my opinion is useful as you research and comparison shop online. Have fun and stay healthy, everybody.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of lavender oil.  I place drops of it on my lamb wool balls that tumble in my dryer with sheets and towels.  I also keep a mister  bottle with very diluted lavender water for our pillows at night.  This is a nice potent blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning Pep suggests combining it with their peppermint oil and using it as an insect repellent.  I combined it with the rose hip carrier oil for a nice blend that soaked into the skin quickly and left the fragrance sitting on top of the skin.  Worked well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to believe it is 100% lavender oil at this price, but that is what the label says.  And it does smell fine to me.  I do have other way more expensive lavender oils that are more potent, but this suits my needs just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One should remember that essential oils are best used diluted with a carrier oil if you intend to place it on your skin.  It should not be applied full-strength to the skin, should not be ingested either--especially not an oil of this potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Morning Pep.</li>
    <li> Pure and Natural Lavender was the first that introduced me to the world of different types of essential oils, useful for its calming effects, especially during times of stressful agitation. Since then I have discovered a multitude of benefits, and the Natural Lavender Essential Oil, is the very best that I have experienced. Carrying a small bottle around is like having my own personal first aid kit, perfume, and calming agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural Lavender Essential Oil by Morning Pep comes in a large 4 oz. dark amber color bottle with a twist off cap. I poured a small amount of the Lavender Oil into a spare bottle with an eye-drop vial, and put the rest away in a cool dark place to preserve the properties of the essential oil. The scent has a sweet and floral scent just the way it is supposed to have rather than the ‘twiggy’ smell from a lower grade product, and I regard this Lavender Essential Oil as a dry oil, because there is NO greasy or oily residue, it has the capacity to absorb into my skin without any tell-tale shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender Oil is one of the most versatile of all essential oils. Most commonly used for its calming effects on the body, therapeutic-grade lavender has been highly regarded for the skin. Used to cleanse cuts, bruises, and skin irritations. The fragrance is calming, relaxing, and balancing - physically and emotionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my primary uses is for insomnia. Often I am unable to sleep, because I cannot turn off my thoughts, plans, and my mental list of things that need my attention. I do NOT believe in sleeping pills or any other sleep aid and so if I do not get a necessary amount of sleep, I usually wake with a headache. This is where the Lavender Oil is my salvation. I either use a few drops of oil in my diffuser or I pour just a drop into my palms, inhale the lavender, and then wipe my palms off onto my pillow. This seems to both calm my over active mind so that I can fall asleep easily, and an extra benefit is that even if I do not get my required amount of sleep, I do not wake with a headache. It may be that the scent of lavender on my pillow relaxes me throughout the night; all I am sure of is that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered Pure and Natural Lavender Essential Oil is effective for minor burns (from cooking); it also is effectual for relieving the itch from insect bites, and reduces inflammation and swelling. However, sometimes we choose a product for one or two specific needs and we forget the versatility of all the benefits that a product has to offer. Therefore, I have provided a list of some of the many uses for Lavender Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: SOME OF THESE REMEDIES, THAT I HAVE LISTED CALL FOR A FEW DROPS ON THE TONGUE - BE VERY CAREFUL AND READ THE LABEL ON THE LAVENDER OIL BOTTLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OIL THAT IS SAFE FOR INTERNAL DIGESTION. SOME OILS ARE EXCLUSIVELY FOR EXTERNAL REMEDIES; THESE LAVENDER OILS SHOULD NOT BE INGESTED FOR SAFETY REASONS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Benefits of Lavender Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Calming - Rub 2-3 drops of lavender oil in your cupped palms, and then inhale. Then, rub on the feet, temples, wrists (or anywhere) for an immediate calming effect on the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Sleep aid - Use the cupping and inhalation method. Then, rub a drop of Lavender oil on your palms and smooth on your pillow to help induce sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Helping young children prepare for sleep - Rub a few drops of oil on the soles of the child&#x27;s feet, or touch the under-side of their noses and the lavender scent should develop a calming effect. Alternatively, place a few drops on the child&#x27;s stuffed animal or pillow to help comfort them at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Winding down before bed as an adult or assisting with sleep disorders - Many adults suffer from sleep disturbances and sleep disorders that range from mild to severe. At many levels, lavender oils and diffusing lavender into the room can help promote calm, restful nights and thereby providing a more restful sleep. Some have used this inside of their CPAP mask and have reported increased sleep effectiveness of up to 35% more sleep per night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Improve concentration - Because of its ability to stabilize mood, reduce anxieties, and help calm the nervous system, Lavender has been reported by many to help improve the ability to concentrate by reducing other symptoms that can distract thought and provide the ability to focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Calmness before an exam - Inhale some drops of Lavender before and during a test if permitted to help an older student reset balance to mind and emotions for testing anxieties. Using the Lavender lightly during study times can also help produce calmness when thinking through particular topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Before a presentation or job interview - Inhale some Lavender aroma and even put a drop or two under the nasal passages to calm emotions before a presentation before peers, colleagues or before a big job interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c) Reduce agitation in dementia patients - Some studies have shown that aromatherapy and other Lavender oil use can help reduce agitation for aging patients who experience agitation and irritability due to dementia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Relief from Bee sting / Insect bite - A drop of Lavender oil on a bee sting or insect bite will help to stop itching and reduce swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Insect repellant that is safe without side effects - Lavender oil is a unique insect repellant that is safe, effective and has no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Repelling insects and moths - place a few drops on a cotton ball for closets and linen drawers to ward off insects and moths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Sunburn relief - Lavender drops can be diluted in water to spray over sunburn to promote relief and healing several times a day. Try using Lavender instead of (or alternating with) aloe-vera gel with diluted apple-cider vinegar to help reduce and minimize the heat and sting of sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Minor burn - Put 2-3 drops Lavender oil on a minor burn to decrease pain. Result: NO redness, swelling, or pain and from my own personal experience, the burn heals much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Minor cuts - Use a drop of Lavender oil on a shallow cut to stop bleeding, clean wound, and kill bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Chapped or sunburned lips and hands - Rub a drop of lavender oil on chapped or sunburned lips for moisturizing and healing. Also works well for dry and chapped hands, and I personally love the subtle lingering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. Hay fever - Rub a drop of lavender oil between your palms and inhale deeply to help alleviate the symptoms of hay fever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. Dandruff - Rub several drops of lavender oil into the scalp to help eliminate dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;13. Eczema / Dermatitis - Mix several drops of Lavender oil with a nut or vegetable carrier oil (coconut, sesame, almond, walnut)and use topically on eczema and dermatitis, this helps to bring relief for dryness and inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14. Hair loss and re-growth for alopecia - Alopecia areata is an autoimmune dysfunction where the hair falls out, often in clumps or patches. In one study documented by the University of Maryland Medical Center, 86 alopecia areata patients went through a split test. Both subjects massaged the scalp daily for 7 months, whereas only half used essential lavender oil during the massage. The experimental group that used Lavender oil reported significant hair re-growth over the control group that simply used scalp massage alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15. Cold sores - Put a drop of lavender oil on a cold sore to bring relief and speed up healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;16. Nosebleed - To stop a nosebleed, put a drop of lavender oil on a tissue and wrap it around a small chip of ice. Push the tissue covered ice chip up under the middle of the top lip to the base of the nose and hold as long as comfortable or until the bleeding stops (do not freeze the lip or gum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17. Acne treatments: Skin oils often cause acne and bacteria, the antiseptic properties of Lavender are effective for managing acne. However, test first on a small area, sensitive skin may require a lavender oil dilution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18. Reducing scar tissue - consistently add Lavender oil to areas of skin that are wounded and beginning to heal to help reduce scarring and promote healing, while providing the antiseptic properties of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;19. Other skin blemishes: Minor rashes, dryness, and other skin irritations have had effective results with treatment of therapeutic-grade Lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20. Other skin fungal infections like candidiasis - Fungal infections are common in humans. Skin infections caused by fungus like candidiasis have shown positive results with topical applications of pure Lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;21. Irritation from shingles - Adult onset of shingles due to the Herpes Zoster virus can be quite irritating and painful. Some people use Lavender oil to alleviate the pain, irritation and itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;22. Scabies infections - Scabies is a water-borne parasite /an illness sometimes transmitted by skin contact from infected persons. Some natural medicinal doctors (NMDs) have used therapeutic-grade Lavender oils and baths in conjunction with other oils such as tea tree oil to effectively kill these parasites that burrow under the skin, lay eggs, and cause allergic irritations and dermatitis. The Lavender oil kills the parasites, and brings relief to skin irritations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;23. Cure for Ringworm - A natural therapy for a minor ringworm infection, pat a few drops on the infected area and within a few days, the ringworm should be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24.

Dry eyes and tear ducts - DO NOT place Lavender in the eyes. However, a drop or two near the bridge of the nose will promote the lacrimal glands to produce tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;26. Ear aches - add a few drops of Lavender oil to a warm, wet compress, and massage the areas around and behind the ears, and the sides of the neck under the jaw-line, following the path starting behind the ear lobes.

Soothe a cough or sore throat - Lavender oil has natural antiseptic, anti-inflammatory properties, and calming effects can help soothe a cough or sore throat due to cough or minor infection. Acquire soothing relief by inhalation or dabbing some drops around the nasal passages and then massaging gently around the neck and throat area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;28. Relief of minor asthmatic and bronchial spasms - minor asthmatic and acute bronchial spasms could result in bronchitis (inflammation of the bronchial tubes) from pollens, bacteria and other allergens or pathogens. Lavender oil diffusing, inhaling, and /or rubbing on the nasal passages and around the chest areas have provided relief for minor asthmatic symptoms and bronchial spasms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;29. Sinusitis and allergy flare-ups - Both Lavender and Peppermint oil are effective for helping reduce the flare-ups from allergies and sinusitis (inflammation of the sinus linings). Place a few drops near the affected areas, nasal passages, temples, forehead, back of the neck, between the eyes (but NOT in the eyes). First, test some near the eyes to make sure the vapors will not irritate or cause the eyes to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30. Soothing tension and headaches - rubbing a few drops on the temples and/or on the back of the neck or trapezius muscles may bring relief and reduce the headaches caused by tension. (Try this before reaching for that bottle of ibuprofen or acetaminophen.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;31. Menstrual cramp relief - Using very warm compresses, also apply Lavender oils around the abdomen while inhaling the diffuse vapors to help calm and relax the muscles, mind, and body for less severe cramping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;32.

Overactive nervous system - Sometimes, other voluntary and involuntary muscle spasms are treatable with Lavender oil massaged on or near the location of the muscle spasms caused by an over-active nerve or nervous system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;35. After surgery pain relief - There are many reported testimonials, one study done on biopsy patients (reported at the University of Maryland Medical Center) for after surgery pain relief showed significant pain decrease in patients who received oxygen with Lavender aromatherapy versus those who just received oxygen without aromatherapy in post-operative scenarios.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;36.

Nausea or minor motion sicknesses - place a drop of Lavender oil on end of tongue, behind the ears or around the navel. This is not intended to prevent motion sickness on a long cruise or in the place of a necessary stronger medicine. However, it can be effective in relieving the symptoms of minor stomach queasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;44. To settle throat or muscle spasms - helpful in treating esophageal spasms or IBS, a few drops of Lavender oil on the tongue can provide muscle relaxation effects on the smooth, involuntary muscles of the digestive system. The Lavender oil can be effective in reducing spasms and bring relaxation and relief to the constricting muscles in the throat. However, it must be therapeutic grade that it pure enough for ingestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested the Natural Essential Lavender Oil for insomnia, and have used this oil in a diffuser for some calming, relaxation after a stressful day. My other uses have included; minor burns, cuts and scrapes, and to reduce the itch and swelling for insect bites. I did not like it on my lips, as it has a slightly bitter taste, but I love using this on my hands as it provides a subtle sweet lingering scent. I add a few drops to my bath, and I add few drops to my other facial and body oil moisturizers. This is an essential oil that uplifts my mood, heals minor skin irritations, and provides a variety uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for an evaluation; my gathered research is from multiple internet sites, my testing results,usages, statements and opinions are my own.ill promote the lacrimal glands to produce tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;26.

    <li> Great lavender- i wish it was organic though...</li>
    <li> When my sister was trying to quit smoking, she tried pills and patches and exercise, but the most valuable advice came from a therapist who told her to try spraying lavender oil when she had the urge to smoke.  Of course, it still wasn&#x27;t easy to quit, but the scent of lavender does seem to have a calming effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper, but this is not of importance to her since she puts it in a spray bottle.  What IS of importance to her is that this does seem to be the \\&quot;real McCoy\\&quot; (since it has the calming effect she uses it for) and that the price is very reasonable. She is accustomed to paying $5-$10 for an ounce bottle, so this is a real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. Judging from our experience, it seems to be a good product at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I love Lavender and I loved this oil.  I have it in a spray bottle, to spray around the house to make it smell awesome.  I have been having trouble sleeping and have sprayed it around the bedroom and it seems to help.  I am planning on combining it with the peppermint and trying it as a bug spray.  I liked that it came in a brown bottle to keep the light out.  I was pleased with the four ounce size of the bottle.  The only draw back for me was no dropper attached to the bottle, but it is easy enough to get those!  A great product, I can wait to find more uses for it!</li>
    <li> I use lavender oil on wool dryer balls and in my diffusers. Lavender is very calming and soothing. It also promotes sleep in adults and children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several brands and wow, there is a huge difference from brand to brand. This oil from Morning Pep smells exactly like the lavender fields in France that I&#x27;ve visited! The only other brand that comes close is from Now Foods, but it isn&#x27;t quite as fabulous as this Morning Pep Lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is very concentrated so just a couple of drops in my diffuser fills my home with fragrance within minutes - and I have a large home. Plus there is no odd chemical smell like in some other brands I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in an amber glass bottle to preserve the oil but there is no dropper. I bought these and they work great but you can buy a glass eyedropper if you prefer. [[ASIN:B00MYMB2D6 Pipet Dropper 4 Pack 4 mL]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Morning Pep provided me with a smaller, free sample for review but a positive review was not asked for, promised or implied. Since this oil is my favorite lavender, I have since purchased the 4oz bottle so the Verified Purchase badge is legit. This is great oil!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as some others I tried,</li>
    <li> This is a large 4 ounce bottle of lavender oil. It has a wonderful scent, perfect for relaxation and sleep. It&#x27;s hard to dispense drops from the bottle without spilling, this does not have a euro dropper cap and it did not include a dropper. You can find pipettes online and even at your pharmacy, without a dropper of some type it would be very easy to spill so pour carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use lavender oil in my diffusers, in my bath water, and I also mix it with other oils. Try adding to hand lotion and shampoo along with a bit of lemon oil, it smells so good! You can even use it in your laundry to make your clothes and bed linens smell great. For a stronger scent I add a few drops to a washrag and toss it into the dryer with the rest of the washed items. I love sleeping on lavender scented sheets! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender helps to relieve stress and will help you to relax. If you don&#x27;t have a diffuser you can add a few drops of lavender oil in a small spray bottle with water, then a few minutes before bed shake the bottle to mix and lightly mist your pillows and bedding, it smells great and it will help you get a good nights sleep. If you&#x27;re just getting started using essential oils, you will find that lavender oil is one of those oils you can&#x27;t do without, it smells great and you will find so many different uses for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Free product sample received in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Lavender is one of the most wonderful smells. This bottle must be a life time supply of lavender oil. The bottle is amber to block light from degrading the oil or the lavender smell. The top is a normal straight bottle, there is no pouring spout or eye dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this huge bottle of lavender essential oil. I&#x27;ve tried a number of other brands of essential oils and I particularly like the fragrance of this one. I use it on my wool dryer balls to fragrance my laundry, and I appreciate that I can use real essential oils rather than chemicals to get fresh smelling, soft laundry out of the dryer. The bottle does not have any sort of stopper on the top, just a regular lid, so if you need an eyedropper, you may want to invest in that separately. I don&#x27;t find I need it, I just press the top of my wool dryer ball to the top of the bottle, to the bottle to the side for just a second, and the wool dryer ball soaks up an appropriate amount of essential oil without needing a dropper. Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> This is a rich, intense and pure Lavendar oil, perhaps the best I have ever tried.  I would highly recommend it to others that love lavendar as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product...the only setback that it should come with a dropper...but this is a good price for 4oz..</li>
