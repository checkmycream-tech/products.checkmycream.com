      <li>I love this set, so much, I plan on giving one to my mother, for Mother&#x27;s day, with a couple of singles, as a start up, for her, to EO&#x27;s</li>
      <li>As usual love this stuff I use it making salve and everyone is delighted with the way it smells</li>
      <li>Awesome, high quality essential oils and essential oil blends.</li>
      <li>I only buy essential oils from this seller, they are by far the best out there for the price.</li>
      <li>These are my first oils I have purchased for my oil diffuser.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>

      <li>All the oils have distinct different scents.</li>
      <li>Enjoying the multiple uses  of these oils from natural air freshner to a pick-me-up when I&#x27;ve had a long day.</li>
      <li>These are high quality essential oils and do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
      <li>To be honest, the oils were very watery, I&#x27;ve never experienced this with any essential oils that I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon, although this is my first time using this brand.</li>
      <li>They all smell really wonderful, but they do seem very thin compared to other brands I use.</li>
      <li>And they arrived a day early.</li>
      <li>It worked very well by different way.</li>
      <li>I am new to essential oil</li>
      <li>Barely scented.</li>
      <li>I use 5 out of 6 of these blends--the cold &amp; flu doesn&#x27;t smell good to me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These oils appear to be diluted. They are very watery. I will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is the worst thing you can ever buy, it smells so bad that it makes me gag. It&#x27;s not just me but I also had friends over to do a smell test and they all said it smelled bad. Unfortunately you can&#x27;t return this item so a refund is out of the picture. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM!!</li>
    <li> Definitely worth buying!!! The product came in a speedy fashion and was well packaged. Instead of wasting tons of hard earned money on those expensive oils I suggests purchasing these, they are just as good if not better. I plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product. Enjoying the multiple uses  of these oils from natural air freshner to a pick-me-up when I&#x27;ve had a long day.</li>
    <li> For the money these are a good product. I just can&#x27;t afford doterra but I really wanted some blends for common uses. When diffused these oils have been great. I personally do not think some of them smell the greatest out of the bottle but when you water them down and diffuse them it is much better.  Some of them I feel like all I can smell is one oil, there is not really a blended smell. My little schnauzer is obsessed with the cold and flu blend! The cold and flu blend also helped both myself and my husband when were not feeling the greatest.</li>
    <li> Product is as described. A middle strong for someone who is hypersensitive, have had to figure out how to dilute it.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect kit of essential oils.  I use them for linen sprays, bath soaks and many other things.</li>
    <li> I love this set, so much, I plan on giving one to my mother, for Mother&#x27;s day, with a couple of singles, as a start up, for her, to EO&#x27;s</li>
    <li> The scents are nice. This is my first set of blended oils purchase, and compared to some other oils these are a bit more liquidy. It comes out really fast from the bottle. I use this is my diffuser, and the for the price I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil pack!!! I am enjoying the use of these oils.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful scents! I have one of the humidifier diffusers and it takes only a small amount of oil to scent the entire room. When I run out, I will be buying more of this product.</li>
    <li> I just started using oils. These have been great. thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not overly excited nor peticular disappointed. I will say it was not what I expected. The essential oil blend does stain if you try to put on light color articles towels ,clothing, etc.</li>
    <li> I gave to my granddaughter</li>
    <li> As usual love this stuff I use it making salve and everyone is delighted with the way it smells</li>
    <li> quality oils that were used in the aromatherapy vapor.</li>
    <li> Very watery as others stated as well. Barely scented. Useless. Seller is very uncooperative as to refunding. Wish i would have listened to other reviews and stayed away.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter along with a diffuser &amp; she loved these oils! Very pleased! Energy, Fresh Air &amp; Happiness were uplifting &amp; smelled amazing!</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but anytime we use one these oils in our diffuser it gives me awful heartburn.  It is quite strange, but every time.</li>
    <li> Great Variety....great way to get started.</li>
    <li> Awesome, high quality essential oils and essential oil blends. I am very happy with my purchase and will be purchasing again from Fabulous Francie as needed.</li>
    <li> I use 5 out of 6 of these blends--the cold &amp; flu doesn&#x27;t smell good to me.  A very nice selection and I use a different one every day, depending on my morning mood.  Very nice.</li>
    <li> Great price ans service.  AA++</li>
    <li> These are my first oils I have purchased for my oil diffuser. Great starter set for beginners like me</li>
    <li> Love these oils. there is such a variety of different oils. The smells are amazing. I use them in my diffuser bought off amazon. Makes my house smell great. When my children are sick I use the cold-flu oil. Helps with their breathing problems. 😀 very happy with fabulous frannie oils&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product to provide an honest review.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY PRODUCT, this set is horrible.... Each one of them stinks!!!! OMG, what a waste of money... I even had my employees give me their scent opinion and we all agreed they r horrible plus you cannot return them...</li>
    <li> Great essential oil starter set.</li>
    <li> smelled horrid and they all smelled the same.  rip off</li>
    <li> Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> It worked very well by different way.</li>
    <li> These smell wonderful.. reminds me of being at a spa.</li>
    <li> To be honest, the oils were very watery, I&#x27;ve never experienced this with any essential oils that I&#x27;ve purchased through Amazon, although this is my first time using this brand. The scents are subjective, some are more pleasant than others in my opinion. The shipping was fast and everything was well packaged. I will not buy this brand again because of the watery oils, I didn&#x27;t like how it just &amp;#34;ran&amp;#34; out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Great value for these oils. I do have some favorites in this sampler set... Cod &amp; Flu and Aches &amp; Pains are probably at the top. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t offer all of these for purchase alone. It seems hit or miss. I&#x27;d like to place another order for Aches &amp; Pains, but can&#x27;t find it aside from being offered with the sampler.</li>
    <li> Watery! Thin! Smells awful! Terrible! Will never buy this brand again. Buy Eden&#x27;s Garden instead! I love that brand!</li>
    <li> I got this for my mother and she was so excited about it. She&#x27;s new to the world of oils and what a great little starter set. They all smell really wonderful, but they do seem very thin compared to other brands I use. Cannot beat the price, though!</li>
    <li> I am new to essential oil so maybe I don&#x27;t know the difference in brand but I like these and the smell of each oil was great the benefits and whether they work on that I do not know yet.  With Happy I was at peace my son felt no difference and I love the smell of the Fresh Air.</li>
    <li> I only buy essential oils from this seller, they are by far the best out there for the price. This sampler pack smells great! I use them in my diffuser and I tried the aches and pains one with a foot bath. Just buy it already.</li>
    <li> All the oils have distinct different scents. Good quality. Great price point.</li>
    <li> I would have liked more marketing on the usage of the essential oils. How to mix with what etc.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. My daughter made fizzy bath bombs at her birthday party and the scents were a hit. I loved the fresh air scent! And they arrived a day early. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for a beginner.  Great selection.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love the scents of this one, except the cold and flu which I have not really used yet but just smelled the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The scents are great and very therapeutic.  A few drops in a hot bath chased away a couple of colds.  I really ordered to use in a diffuser.  But I have done every thing but that.</li>
    <li> I LOVE FAB FRANNIE &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I couldn&#x27;t be happier purchasing these essential oils that smell beyond charming, beyond enthralling!</li>
    <li> Great product. Good as YL?</li>
    <li> Smells great haven&#x27;t tried them all yet but have been quite pleased with this purchase</li>
    <li> These are high quality essential oils and do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do. I actually like them more than my Young Living ones.</li>
