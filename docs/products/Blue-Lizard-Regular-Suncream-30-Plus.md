<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This sunscreen works great, with a physical (mineral) rather than chemical barrier. It is pricey but for something so important I feel I have to suck it up and pay it. This seller shipped our package lightning fast.</li>
    <li> I am a professional swimming instructor and the mother of two very fair skinned/light eyed kids who love to swim.  I was introduced to this product four years ago when my younger child was 18 months old by a mother who had lived in Florida and had fair skinned red haired children.  We both swear by this to keep kids from sunburn.  If applied correctly it will keep the TAN away.  My kids both have very sensitive skin, as well, and this has never caused any kind of rash or reaction for them.  They come to the pool with me at 9 am and swim constantly until noon.  They sometimes forget to re-apply after toweling off, and the Lizard stays strong and doesn&#x27;t let them burn.  I highly recommend this product for all.</li>
    <li> At 64 years old I&#x27;ve got plenty of skin damage and am more aware of having to use a good sunscreen. This is what my dermatologist carries and it does work well on my arms and legs. But it can be a bit messy on my face and I need to work it in to get the white to clear up. My eyes are pretty sensitive to many of these products and they do burn after awhile if I apply this too close. I also got the Face version but didn&#x27;t find it to apply any easier or be any better near my eyes.</li>
    <li> Wanted a top quality sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t greasy and found it in this product. Have tried expensive products -- this is as good or better than any I&#x27;ve tried and much cheaper. Zinc Oxide is a physical blocker -- much better than chemical blockers like oxybenzone.  Actually makes my face feel firmer somehow (I&#x27;m 51, so that&#x27;s a good thing!) Goes on slightly white and pasty, but not overly so at all. Other products are thinner, but they are also greasier.  Overall, this wears better on the skin and under makeup than any other I&#x27;ve tried.  And it works great.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is tested to retain its SPF rating after 240 minutes in a whirlpool.  The only problem I have had which is true with all sunscreens is that it will rub off if you wear a shirt after putting it on.  You should reapply then before you get in the sun.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist told me to use this on my 1 yr old son! So far no burns... easy - a bit thick so a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> My kids and I are super sensitive to the sun. I burn if I am outside for more then 15 mins. I don&#x27;t even change color with this stuff and my kids are safe from burning and sun rash.</li>
    <li> I have had skin cancer removed, my son and daughter are redheads and my granchildren are fair and light-eyed.  I was introduced to this product on a TV show and have purchased it every summer for 4 years.  It is the BEST!  We can go swimming...at the pool, lake or ocean...and no one gets a sunburn (unless they want to :)&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Blue Lizard Sunscream!!</li>
    <li> Parts of my body are sensitive to the sun and heat. My dermatologist suggested that I purchase this especially since I was going to be on a 9 day cruise. I&#x27;m getting another bottle. I usually burn on my legs..not one red mark. It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell. I was playing in the middle of the ocean for over an hour and it didn&#x27;t come off.</li>
    <li> This is the only sun screen my husband will use. He had melanoma about 10 years ago and his oncologist highly recommends this product. I&#x27;ve never seen him burn while using blue lizard. We highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Overrated!!  I was hoping for a good product. And this product did not live up to it. After using it.i was not comfortable with the protection it was supposed to provide!</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It did not have any white residue on my skin.  My skin felt great after putting it on, and there was no skin reaction or ordor from the product.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen. My fair skinned family can now go to the beach and not burn. I buy it whenever I can find it.</li>
    <li> My four kids and I are exceptionally pale, and still look that way at the end of a summer of being outside and at the pool. We burn through most other sunscreens. I&#x27;ve used this for several years, and will never switch.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, easy to use. The white color absorbs quickly. No burn after 1+ hr</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It&#x27;s thicker than most and has good coverage. It lasts forever! My son uses it b/c he is allergic to other sunscreens and this doesn&#x27;t give him a reaction. I can apply to his skin and not worry about him getting burnt. He swims and it stays on. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size of the bottle but it&#x27;s worth it. It is a very high quality lotion.</li>
    <li> My son got tanned despite of using this daily. He had golf lessons 3 times a week in the mornings! and only for one hour! he came back home darker after each lesson. My husband got a tan too but didn&#x27;t burn too bad. It&#x27;s not easy to spread, leaves white cast, you have to rub it in a lot to get rid of whiteness, and hairy fuzzy men, forget it!!! We tried Australian gold brand (easier to spread but stinks to high heavens), and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in protection. The verdict -  try something different.</li>
    <li> light fragrance feels light best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used</li>
