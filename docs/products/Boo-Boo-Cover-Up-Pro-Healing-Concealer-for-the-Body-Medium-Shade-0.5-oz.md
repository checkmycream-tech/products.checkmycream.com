      <li>Bought this product upon recommendation for some friends and they were thrilled!</li>
      <li>Covers up well with good staying coverage.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>

      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this healing concealer!</li>
      <li>The added skincare benefits are nice and I did find that it did well covering scratches and acne bumps.</li>
      <li>I was able to try out this product before it was widely available and loved it!  </li>
      <li>Love, love LOVE this product!  </li>
      <li>I was pretty happy that it had ingredients that had healing/beneficial properties, which you don&#x27;t get from the acne cream.  </li>
      <li>all fine (...and forgotten, honestly) until my girlfriend mentioned that she had been bitten by a spider while away one weekend.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that I agree :)</li>
      <li>Would love if it came in more shades.</li>
      <li>I used this on the face (it is formulated to be safe for the face as well) and it easily lasted a full 12 hours.  </li>
      <li>The product blends easily, the coverage is definitely full and can be easily built upon.  </li>
      <li>although it says medium shade, it is way too light.</li>
      <li>It does a good job at covering the acne scaring but anyone would be able to tell that im wearing something because my skin is a different color.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>I found out about two weeks ago from searching online that I have a purple acne scar from trying to get rid of a pimple to quickly.</li>
      <li>so I couldn&#x27;t use it right away.</li>
      <li>She has very light (white) skin and it covered up her scrapes and bruises well.  </li>
      <li>I have bought lots of things on Amazon, but this is the first I have chosen to review.</li>
      <li>I think it may have gotten too hot in shipping.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, but this stuff is great for pimples, red splotches, or any minor imperfections.</li>
      <li>The tube is large and a very generous amount of product for the price.</li>
      <li>Very blendable.</li>
      <li>The color is very blendable.  </li>
      <li>I put it on at night and in the morning the pimples are either gone or much improved.</li>
      <li>Definitely would recommend to all -- especially if new &#x27;shades&#x27; are added!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>A friend shared how much she really likes this new product \\&quot;BooBoo Cover-Up\\&quot;, talking up the natural healing ingredients while not showing the bug bites that look like the early signs of chickenpox...</li>
      <li>I was pretty skeptical, but all in all, very glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;m a male, I can&#x27;t exactly use blush or something.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, creamy, feels good on the skin, not cakey or heavy or fake.</li>
      <li>Sinks slightly into lines of face but does match skin color (fair skinned yellow complexion)</li>
      <li>I bought a tube for myself and both of my teenage daughters - they tell me they couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
      <li>Major gashes on my nose and forehead.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised though that I only got one tube, not two as shown in the photo</li>
      <li>Though it is a little dark for a light complexion - you can mix it to get your skin tone</li>

    <li> When I got this product it was water down so I couldn&#x27;t use it right away. Next day when I tried it, it blended in to the areas I wanted to conceal but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I wanted something that was water-proof and conceal for at least 24 hrs it might have lasted 6 hours. So needless to say I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Boo Boo works great,it conceals like it says,and goes a lonnnnng ways,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great coverup.  It covers well.  It lasts for a number of days.  My only complaint is it only comes in one shade which is a little too dark for me.  It also seems to heal whatever it covers up.</li>
    <li> Covers up well with good staying coverage. Builds well.  Arrived quickly.  The color is very blendable.  Comparable to Benefit&#x27;s concealer.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought this product upon recommendation for some friends and they were thrilled! Have not seen a product that is comparable anywhere on the market and can&#x27;t complain at all about the price for the value/benefit of the product.  Definitely would recommend to all -- especially if new &#x27;shades&#x27; are added!</li>
    <li> A friend shared how much she really likes this new product \\&quot;BooBoo Cover-Up\\&quot;, talking up the natural healing ingredients while not showing the bug bites that look like the early signs of chickenpox... all fine (...and forgotten, honestly) until my girlfriend mentioned that she had been bitten by a spider while away one weekend. I thought to buy a tube of this stuff and as hoped, got big points!!  I likely won&#x27;t be the buyer in the future, but I know my sig other is all about it... especially when back in the midwest where the bugs feast!</li>
    <li> Love, love LOVE this product!  I discovered Boo-Boo Cover Up when it was sent to me in an Ipsy mailing.  It covers wonderfully and does not look cakey.  One small tube has lasted 13 months!</li>
    <li> This concealer does it all, medium-full coverage. Very blendable. Would love if it came in more shades. The tube is large and a very generous amount of product for the price. Easy to use, creamy, feels good on the skin, not cakey or heavy or fake. The added skincare benefits are nice and I did find that it did well covering scratches and acne bumps. Would recommend &amp; Repurchase.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this and found it worked well layered on little by little on acne scars, but was a little dried out by end of the day. Sinks slightly into lines of face but does match skin color (fair skinned yellow complexion) well.  I was surprised though that I only got one tube, not two as shown in the photo</li>
    <li> I found out about two weeks ago from searching online that I have a purple acne scar from trying to get rid of a pimple to quickly. I also read that they can take a year or so to go away. Previously, I was using an acne cream that was tinted, but using it for a couple of weeks really dried out my skin. Being a guy, I was too embarrassed to go to a makeup counter to get cover-up so I tried online and found this. I was pretty happy that it had ingredients that had healing/beneficial properties, which you don&#x27;t get from the acne cream.  After about a week of using it I can actually tell my scar is getting lighter. When it is applied, I cannot even see the scar unless I happen to rub it off by rubbing my face. I was pretty skeptical, but all in all, very glad I bought this. I have bought lots of things on Amazon, but this is the first I have chosen to review.</li>
    <li> Product is an excellent blemish coverup that, most importantly helps the healing process. It doesn&#x27;t make the skin oily either. Color is limited so it may be a bit off to use on the face, but face powder will blend it in.</li>
    <li> I was being silly in the pool (doing headstands) and banged my head hard on the pool floor.  Major gashes on my nose and forehead.  I looked like I had gotten into a bar fight.  Not exactly the way you want to show up for meetings (I&#x27;m a small business owner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend had told me about this product.  Man, was it a lifesaver.  It concealed all my scrapes, practically to a T.  Since I&#x27;m a male, I can&#x27;t exactly use blush or something.  Plus, this not only covered my wounds but helped in the healing process.  Probably same like Neosporin.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a life saver for going out in public and hiding what ever your issues are without the embarrassment of &amp;#34;obvious&amp;#34; make up!  Though it is a little dark for a light complexion - you can mix it to get your skin tone and if you can keep your hands from fussing with it, it will stay on a long time...try a little face powder over it and it won&#x27;t shine up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up, but this stuff is great for pimples, red splotches, or any minor imperfections. A little goes a long way, so this little tube lasts a long time! Not only that, but I&#x27;m really impressed with how well it matches my skin tone. You dab it on and blend slightly and you&#x27;re good to go. I bought a tube for myself and both of my teenage daughters - they tell me they couldn&#x27;t live without it! I have to say that I agree :)</li>
    <li> I was able to try out this product before it was widely available and loved it!  The product blends easily, the coverage is definitely full and can be easily built upon.  I used this on the face (it is formulated to be safe for the face as well) and it easily lasted a full 12 hours.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I apply it once a day and it lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Hi, im indian so i have dark skin and although it says medium shade, it is way too light. It does a good job at covering the acne scaring but anyone would be able to tell that im wearing something because my skin is a different color. Basically only buy this if your skin is white.</li>
    <li> I love this healing concealer! I put it on at night and in the morning the pimples are either gone or much improved.</li>
    <li> My mom fell and had some wounds on her face.  She has very light (white) skin and it covered up her scrapes and bruises well.  However, it is not a perfect match.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t work at all- I think it may have gotten too hot in shipping.</li>
