      <li>lol</li>
      <li>I was glad to find this on Amazon.com!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very nice, but it should have more speed and intensity!</li>
      <li>Also, the seeing is a good medium...</li>
      <li>THIS PRODUCT LOOKS GOOD AND SPOUSE LIKE</li>
      <li>Kandy Burress does sex toys the absolute best</li>
      <li>Great gag gift for a friend getting married.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light vibrating feeling that doesn&#x27;t get the job started or finished.</li>
      <li>but many don&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>I WISH YOUR PRODUCT WERE IN BETTER CONDITION</li>
      <li>so for the price its just OKAY</li>
      <li>The vibration isn&#x27;t strong at all.</li>
      <li>cheaply made.</li>
      <li>It makes no sense to have a discreet shape and then sound like the engine of a jet plane.</li>
      <li>everything I expected and more!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s discrete enough to leave out and powerful enough for a very very good time</li>
      <li>Very soft tip with easy switch.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but the vibrations are not strong but it does okay</li>
      <li>Broke (or needed repairs) after first use.</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor and spend more money to invest in one that will actually last and work well--this one won&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It works very well and does the job right.</li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>IT FAST</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>and I didnt spend much at all for it</li>
      <li>I had an almost identical one for years before this kind of trouble.</li>
      <li>Not too loud and if your looking for discreet this item is as discreet as it can get!!!</li>
      <li>Had a fun time watching her open it and seeing her reactions</li>
      <li>Nice little toy for on the go, but not really that intense.</li>
      <li>/&gt;IT IS LOUD.</li>
      <li>Ridiculously loud.</li>

    <li> Loved it! It works very well and does the job right. Very soft tip with easy switch. It is a little vintage looking in the fact it&#x27;s a little bit bulky but many don&#x27;t know the difference. Also, the seeing is a good medium... Just enough juice 😉</li>
    <li> The vibration isn&#x27;t strong at all. It&#x27;s a very light vibrating feeling that doesn&#x27;t get the job started or finished. Never buying something like this online again.</li>
    <li> If you bought this, you likely looked at the price and said, &amp;#34;What the heck?&amp;#34; I did that--and got what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS LOUD. Ridiculously loud. It makes no sense to have a discreet shape and then sound like the engine of a jet plane. Let me put it this way: if you live in an apartment, your neighbors will think you&#x27;re running heavy machinery. I&#x27;m not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has one speed, which sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second item of this type I bought based on price, and they both went into the trash. Do yourself a favor and spend more money to invest in one that will actually last and work well--this one won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT LOOKS GOOD AND SPOUSE LIKE IT.MY SPOUSE RECOMMEND THIS TOY TO HER FRIEND.AND IT FAST TO CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS DIFFERENT COLOR TO CHOSE FROM.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but the vibrations are not strong but it does okay , this was my 1st one.. so for the price its just OKAY</li>
    <li> Great gag gift for a friend getting married. Had a fun time watching her open it and seeing her reactions lol it was great!</li>
    <li> I really only like the packaging and that it goes in your purse and no one knows what it is. It really doesn&#x27;t do much. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s like your phone vibrating in your hand.</li>
    <li> everything I expected and more!! I read about a product something like this in a book on my kindle. Needless to say, my curiosity was sparked! I was glad to find this on Amazon.com!!</li>
    <li> NO MY LIP STICK BROKE AND I AM NOT SATISFIED AT THE LEAST I WISH YOUR PRODUCT WERE IN BETTER CONDITION</li>
    <li> cheaply made. no power behind the battery barely feel the vibration!</li>
    <li> The worst of my collection.&lt;br /&gt;Not the best.&lt;br /&gt;Too small.&lt;br /&gt;Not enough anything.&lt;br /&gt; Kandy Burress does sex toys the absolute best</li>
    <li> Its louad and one speed. I hate it. It does get the job done after a while tho.</li>
    <li> Love this item!!! No one will ever guess what it is!!! As soon as my friends saw it they wanted one!!! Not too loud and if your looking for discreet this item is as discreet as it can get!!!</li>
    <li> Nice little toy for on the go, but not really that intense.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. Its crap....Terrible waste of money. I don&#x27;t think I will be making a purchase like that again</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I really enjoyed it. However I dropped it once and it broke.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice, but it should have more speed and intensity!</li>
    <li> I really like it.  It&#x27;s discrete enough to leave out and powerful enough for a very very good time and I didnt spend much at all for it</li>
    <li> Broke (or needed repairs) after first use. Very poorly constructed. I had an almost identical one for years before this kind of trouble. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> too small, not very useful</li>
