<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used the face lift tapes for 2 years now and use them almost every day.  When I first used the tapes, they were very strong and would stay on for several days even through showers.  Currently for about the last 4 months, the tapes barely stay on for a day.  I am very disappointed as they are really great and make me look so much younger.  I have been looking to change companies as I am very unhappy with the tapes</li>
    <li> I love them!  They give me 10 years back.</li>
    <li> Been using these for years now, when I&#x27;m feeling &amp;#34;saggy&amp;#34;....their &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; line sucks though. Stick with the tried and true.</li>
    <li> easy to use,  achieves desired look</li>
    <li> what was I thinking????? once and done</li>
    <li> Make me look 10 years younger love this product.</li>
    <li> i received these tapes and they were in good shape.  These tapes work very good.  I am happy with the CosmeSearch.Inc. face lift tape program.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to look younger instantly.  I mainly use the neck lift, but it alone makes a world of difference.</li>
    <li> Tapes arrived but didn&#x27;t know to order strings to hold them in place. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> They were fun to share with others!</li>
    <li> Have used for years....cannot say enough good about them.  I show all the women I meet.  Secret - you can reuse them if worn for short periods and or not sweating too much.  You&#x27;d be surprised that you don&#x27;t actually need long hair to wear them.  I have a boob that is cut short in back and they work just fine.</li>
    <li> these work great; when I first used I felt like people could see them but I have had these on and gone to work, out to dinner and made no really big fuss to cover just wore hair as usual, I have even worn my hair up and no one has noticed.  I can&#x27;t afford botox or lazers so their is my poor person face lift.  have not tried for forehead it still drooping but jawls are tight.</li>
    <li> Not very pleased , to hard to put on by your self ..</li>
    <li> Product comes from California, Solana Beach as read on the yellow envelope that is sent to you. I always want to know that I am getting  my monies worth on ANYTHING! Given that, I counted the tapes and made sure there were exactly 40 in the small plastic bag that their stored in... yes, there were 40 as stated in the details. It arrived a day before intended delivery date. Overall, satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have tried others and these work the best for me. I recommend these tapes for women who over the age of 50.</li>
    <li> it came in different packing and much less tapes. ....some of them were sticking against each other. ...it came late and it should be improved. ...</li>
    <li> For not hold skin tight.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on, last all day, comfortable. Using this product now for 3 years. Recommend it 100%!</li>
    <li> I really like this produce cause nobody can tell I am wearing anything... even my boyfriend.... BUT it takes YEARS off of my appearance, and I feel like I look great!!!</li>
    <li> I use these and I dont want to be without them.</li>
    <li> Does NOT stick.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been buying a hearty supply from this wonderful company for some time now &amp; am spoiled by the way they make you look! They are easy to use,just make sure your skin has been cleaned of oils with some alcohol 1st.To assure they keep my face lifted,I place a paper tape strip to cover over one end of the tape to the other (you can get this tape at Walgreens &amp; keeps gauze bandages on.)  I keep shopping at CosmeSearch,since they give me great enough service &amp; product that I have no need to look further.</li>
    <li> Good product, but should come with additional  rubber holds. I will by this product again.  Maybe try to make a little smaller.</li>
    <li> Ladies!!  You MUST try these...they are the best thing since sliced bread!  At age 69, I get so many compliments on how great I &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; that its almost embarrassing!  But, they are correct, these tapes will make you look about 8-10 years younger when wearing them.  I&#x27;ve used them for over 3 years and can now put them on and take them off without looking in the mirror.  When I apply a set, normally, I will leave them on for about 3 days (I do remove the elastic band when I&#x27;m not in public).  Showering, washing hair is possible...just be sure to dry them completely with your hair dryer for a couple of minutes, and always press them on and hold your warm hands on them before attaching the elastic, too.  I&#x27;ve also learned that it is important to clean (shave) the area before and after application.  On a few occasions, my skin has been slightly irritated due to my pulling them off too quickly or leaving them on too long, but not often.  So, now when I get a compliment, IF my friend is in need of them, and almost all of us are, and has a hair style that will accommodate the tapes, I happily share my &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; with her.  Everyone wants to order, so I have that information memorized so that they can enjoy looking a few years younger, too!  In fact, I think I&#x27;ll order more right now...I try to keep plenty on hand and always have a spare set with me in my purse...just in case once slips off or an elastic breaks.  Sure is cheaper than a neck lift!</li>
    <li> for the most part,it was a waste of money unless I had to take a special photo. they don;t stay on very well maybe 20 min and you have to run and fix them. customer service was ok though.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product!  Will not be without it.</li>
    <li> Great product, just make sure the tapes are available when you order.</li>
    <li> These refill tapes and the complete kit, Instant Face Lift, are excellent. I have used this product for several years. You can get fabulous results with a little practice. You can leave the tapes in place for a few days if they don&#x27;t get too wet (from sweat or water) but ALWAYS release the elastic band while sleeping.  Start using with the least tension and add more for extra lift. Always use the least required tension to allow for a natural look.  Do not just pull the elastic bands tight, this can break or weaken the bands and is not good for your skin. Always bend over and let gravity do some of the pulling. Get lots of help by going to youtube.com for videos. You will look pretty, young and fresh with this product.</li>
    <li> Now these are wonderful! So easy to use and it takes years off of your face.&lt;br /&gt;Great for taking family photos or going out for the evening. You could also use them&lt;br /&gt;every day if you want. Fantastic product! Highly recommend it. I have ordered them before.</li>
    <li> I have been using this tape for over a year now and I look great. Also about 2 and half years ago I had a mini face lift. So the tapes just helps bring the skin back a little more. But the only problem am having with the tape is that I have very sensitive  skin and the tapes had turned the part of my skin dark and now I been getting treatments for it to turn it back to my brown skin color. But over all I really love these tapes and I order them every month cause everyday I cant be seen without them. They just make me look better and younger am 45 and look 36 now.</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what it said it would do.  A little tricky the first time used, but practice makes perfect.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> These tapes do what no cream can. They help me look years younger and they stay on all day.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with results.</li>
    <li> OI would give it 5 stars if the tapes are made less obvious and maybe different shape depending where you desire to put the lift. The size and shape limits the areas where you can apply the lift. also hard to cover with foundation. still obvious.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It takes little time, effort and helps hide a multitude of wrinkles.  I&#x27;m almost 70 and lots of people can&#x27;t believe how &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; I look. Younger men still don&#x27;t open the door for me, but some of them look. Ha, Ha.  70&#x27;s the new 40 here.</li>
    <li> The Instant Face, Neck and Eye Products are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;This product is a self esteem booster. I bought this product for several reasons: friends were beginning to ask if I felt alright, if I was tired, if I worked too hard coupled with the discovery of  the face looking back at me in the mirror WAS...a tired, droopy faced old woman.&lt;br /&gt;Since I began wearing the CosmeSearch face tape system everyone tells me I look fantastic (I haven&#x27;t told anyone) and those who meet me tell me they cannot believe I am 63 years old!&lt;br /&gt;The elastic bands are easy to use and the tapes easily applied and removed. I tried another product using plastic ties. The plastic was hard to adjust, slipped frequently and I felt was not as discreet as the CosmeSearch product.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; your spirits (and your jowls)!!!&lt;br /&gt;Signed (with a pseudonym):&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Nice to see me again!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate and buy this product? I have been using this product for years every day and no one knows love it</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The tapes are very good.  They do what they&#x27;re supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re expensive.  Paying $15 (shipping included) for 40 tapes which in reality you&#x27;re getting 20 uses of them (2 tapes per use), is quite expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great trick to look younger.  Works really well once you get accustomed to placing the tapes in the correct position.  I use it daily...much more affordable than a face lift!</li>
    <li> These tapes do what is advertised. These will take 10 years off your face. Be patient when applying. Good buy.</li>
    <li> Their products are top notch! The people are awesome!! They Are a MUST have for anyone wanting to look their best!</li>
    <li> Instead of this, try an athletic tape like mueller or k tape. Cut to your size. Will stay put for days! Works better at pulling back neck skin, plus erases any neck pain you may have!  One piece the size of a bandaid will knock 10 years off your neck!  And a roll will last you months and save you tons of $!  Give it a try....</li>
    <li> I have been using the Cosmesearch facelift tapes and bands for over a year.  After losing 50 pounds, my face thinned out, but the extra skin sagged.  I researched the cost of a facelift and came across Cosmesearch.  The system consists of 2 elastic bands that hook in the back of your head and medical type tape with a hole in the top of it to insert into the band.  You put the tape on each elastic band, and one at a time peel of the backing of the tape, lift your face with your hands to achieve desired look, attach the tape, do the same with the other side of your face, and hook the bands together.  You first clean with alcohol the area for placement of the tapes.  I swear by this inexpensive system!  I will NEVER go a day without my Cosmesearch facelift because instead of looking 64+, I look 40!  This is not a gimmick, and I strongly urge you to try it if you want to look younger without paying thousands of dollars for a facelift you may have to have repeated anyway.  These tapes are also part of the neck lift system.  Go to [...] for a video about this facelift.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> when they stick they are amazing. but sometime one will not stick and keeps falling off..but it really does make a difference.</li>
    <li> Not good for thin hair, otherwise works great</li>
    <li> They are great but a little big and harder to hide. This is my second order. I use them in special iccasions</li>
    <li> I had a facelift ten years ago.  These do a much better job.  The surgery didn&#x27;t lift as good as with these.  One set lasts 3 days.  They&#x27;re very comfortable, and I wear them every day.  TIP:  I use a hair extension clip at the back of my head to make it more secure.</li>
    <li> Love these tapes, have been using for a couple of years now and have not had any problems with them. After washing my face and applying my face cream I clean the area where the tape go with alcohol, after it dries I pat the area with a piece of tape then apply the face lift tapes. I put my make up on after that.  My hair is long but tapes to neck hold even in hot weather.  To remove I use either an alcohol pad to the tape or face cream this prevents any irritation to my skin. I would never have surgical face lift, can&#x27;t afford and afraid of complications, and has to bee repeated every few years. These tapes give me the results I want without the cost or complications.  I will say that at first it does take some time to find the best place to apply the tapes to get the effect you want but once you are satisfied it&#x27;s quick and easy to do.  I never leave home without them.</li>
    <li> this is pretty amazing it really does work but unless your hair will cover it it will be seen.  its not totally invisible tape. if it was it would have gotten 5 stars.  good product that actually does work.</li>
    <li> These are Great ! I&#x27;ve had many re orders</li>
    <li> Always use them before I start applying make up, love them!</li>
    <li> These things are amazing</li>
    <li> They are great but not water proof. So if it&#x27;s hot outside forget it. Need to make water proof ones.</li>
    <li> I never even got to try them because the two elastic &amp;#34;straps&amp;#34; provided to hold the tape in place broke before I could even see if the product worked. Worst thing is I purchased a second set of tapes to have on hand. Now I have all these unusable tapes with no elastic bands.Extremely disappointing.</li>
    <li> These tapes are incredible I have ordered them two times.  It&#x27;s part of my beauty regiment.  It&#x27;s unbelievable that these tiny tapes attached to the bands produce instant face lift and takes years off your face.  Try them ladies you won&#x27;t regret it and will feel great about your appearance. What a great invention.</li>
    <li> this is an automatic re order for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave home without them in place .I  actually had facial fillers that cost me  $3,500 that lasted approximately 8 months that did no more to improve my looks than this product. The tapes stay in place until I remove them. They are easy to use when instructions are followed.</li>
    <li> This certainly doesn&#x27;t work.........</li>
    <li> These work really well, at least for me. They really stick well and stay on all day, no problems at all.  Also the fast shipping is appreciated.</li>
    <li> The adhesive on these are great.  I do make sure my skin is dry where they are to be placed by dabbing it with a bit of alcohol.  They usually last me all day, but I always keep extras in my purse in case they slip.</li>
    <li> This is the best invention since electricity!!</li>
    <li> Stick great.  Wipe area with rubbing alcohol.  Wore these for up to 10 hours.</li>
    <li> My wife says it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> These are great especially on th neck! My friends kept telling me how good I looked! I ordered the new ones, hear they are easier and better.</li>
    <li> This literally makes me look 15 years younger with the neck!  It&#x27;s easy to use there.  It&#x27;s comfortable as well.</li>
    <li> all I can say is thank God in about time something worth buying</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have purchased anything like this. No attachment cords. Unable to use them.</li>
    <li> The kit these refill tapes go with is great for photo shoots. You get a good amount of tapes here for the money and they work just like the original ones in the Instant Face Lift Kit. The company delivers them very quickly, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent, i love it!! It works with any problems :-)</li>
    <li> Product is great and does what it is advertised to do. Usually, this seller is super-efficient and ships the product on time. This time, I got it much later than anticipated. Not sure if it was because of the Thanksgiving holiday. Otherwise, the product is great.</li>
    <li> I use these tapes a lot and love them. Lately, the adhesive has been easier to remove after use and I appreciate that. I would recommend these tapes especially for special occasions even though I use them more often than not.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and I like it. The only problem is that I need to wear my hair down to cover the tapes.</li>
    <li> I love those refill tapes.  They do what they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> it does the job..i look years younger..no jowls...no neck wrinkles..my husband comes home from work and says &amp;#34;hi beautiful&lt;br /&gt;woman&amp;#34;. we have been married 43 years and never called me that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to hide the bands in my hair and the tape irritates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not something that I would use again.</li>
    <li> Well,when the tapes arrived,that&#x27;s all there was.just the tabs,no directions. I went on line to find out how they work,turns out there suppose to come with 2 stretchy bands, they were also missing.</li>
    <li> What a great invention. The lift is just enough that my friends will say, &amp;#34;Gee, you are looking younger!&amp;#34; But not so much that there is an obvious pull on the cheek area. I love to wear my &amp;#34;headband&amp;#34; when I am out with my husband, or my friends, and especially at those family reunions. I don&#x27;t really wear it everyday, just when I want to look especially ravishing for an evening.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really got the hang of the neck band. I think I must sweat there, or the tape isn&#x27;t attached to the skin, but rather to the neck hairs.  The eye lifts are too long for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish I could buy in bulk at a discount!&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend this secret.</li>
    <li> I like the product and have used it before.  I would recommend for anyone with enough hair to cover the ear area completely.  My hair is medium length and sometimes the tabs show.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 74 but still have a leadership position and need to connect with women of all ages. Yesterday I had used the face lift tapes, and ran to the grocery store. A friend there said, &amp;#34;You look like a model. You must have a maid because you don&#x27;t look like do much housework.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this secret face lift that takes about 5 minutes every 2 days.</li>
    <li> Not very sturdy... broke very easily</li>
    <li> Great for special occasions, but I wouldn&#x27;t use for a date. Need to practice a little first. The neck string needs to be stronger as mine broke after the third use.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I will continue to use it until there is an improved version. I have used this type of product for 15 years.</li>
    <li> I have use the tapes for while now and I love them ,  only downside is occasionally if I get hot sweaty the tabs work lose , so now I try and put the neck tapes just above my ear lobe where I don&#x27;t sweat,  I look and feel years younger and get loads of compliments on how well I look ...... its my secret , until they find out for them selves.......... well would u tell ...</li>
    <li> Once i got used to it and learned the.process, it is a daily routine for me. It&#x27;s worth reading the comments from everyone to learn the nuances. It&#x27;s one of those products that won&#x27;t be for everyone.</li>
    <li> I like the tapes and have used them for years. I would love to try the all in one bands, do you plan to carry them again?</li>
    <li> The Refill tapes are expensive and if you use 4 every day, you&#x27;ll be out in 10 days.  And in 30 days you will have spent $40. x 12 months &#x3D; $520.   Since the glue on the tapes is only good for ONE application here&#x27;s a money saving Tip!  TIP: Order Pros-Aide aka Spirit Gum from Amazon to keep the tapes in place and on tight.  Step #1:  First wipe the facial/neck area with a cotton pad soaked with alcohol to remove any dirt or makeup.  Let dry.  Step #2: Peel off one tape at a time and brush on a small amount of the Spirit Gum then pressing onto the side of your face or neck, holding for 20 seconds while it adheres.  For the face, place each rubber band behind your ear and out of the way while you repeat the other side.  Step #3: Hook up in the back of your head.  Step #4: Lightly brush on tinted face powder over the tapes to help conceal them.  Step #5:  Before retiring, remove the bands with the tapes still attached, glue side up,  and store somewhere DRY, i.e, on your dresser, vanity, etc., where there is no chance of them getting wet.  Now, the next time when you&#x27;re ready to RE-USE the tapes, repeat all the Steps with the SAME tapes.  This idea saves you money and you get a lot more wear.</li>
    <li> SOMETIMES I WORRY &amp;#34;WHAT IF THEY DON&#x27;T  SELL THIS  ANYMORE....&amp;#34;  I CAN&#x27;T  LIVE WITHOUT.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD, BUT THE ELASTIC TENDS TO MARK THE NECK IF USED ALL DAY. THE NEWER VERSION IS ALSO GOOD BUT .COULD STAND SOME IMPROVEMENT.  IT TENDS TO SEPARATE AT THE END. AND PULLS AWAY FROM THE MIDDLE PORTION.  I T WOULD BE HELPFUL ALSO IF IT WERE A WEE BIT WIDER IN THE MIDDLE SO AS NOT TO CREASE THE NECK.</li>
    <li> I like them but, the glue does not last long. I have to use new one every time that  I need to wear them. It is a waste because the advertisement said I could use the same for at least 2 or 3 times. Please improve.</li>
    <li> I prefer these over the secret lift pro because the tape sticks even during a sweaty workout at the gym...I just wish there was a more comfortable elastic for your neck...all in all I am very happy I found this product...I feel 10 years younger when I wear my Secret Lift :-D</li>
    <li> These work well but the metal clip digs into your neck.</li>
    <li> A++ love the product ,superb customer service , fast shipping !! highly recommend</li>
    <li> I wish I would have saved my money and time. The product didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claims. It&#x27;s poorly made and I suggest you save your money. I will never, never purchase any product from this company again.</li>
    <li> It was idea in some one mind and now that idea is apart of mine instant face&lt;br /&gt;And neck for life don&#x27;t go out without&lt;br /&gt;It &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> Will order again love this product</li>
    <li> These bungee cords as I call them work great when used with the rest of the kit.  These are just refills.  I only used them for special occasions but they do make a difference in jowl and neck sagging.</li>
    <li> Looked 10 years younger</li>
    <li> Great product!  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love these tapes!!!!  Amazing!! 💕. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> These work beautifully. As long as you have hair that is long enough on the side to cover the adhesive. Takes 10 years off INSTANTLY!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this by mistake. Sorry</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost three years.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Well, all I can say is I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.  The difference is subtle, but it&#x27;s definitely noticeable.  What I typically hear is &amp;#34;I like your hair that way&amp;#34; (although it&#x27;s been THIS way for years), or &amp;#34;have you lost weight?&amp;#34;  or &amp;#34;your makeup looks really good.&amp;#34;  The tapes do exactly what they promise to do; smooth out the neck and slightly life the jowls - just enough to make a noticeable difference in your appearance.  And they stay on.  I can&#x27;t say they&#x27;ve erased 10 years, but there&#x27;s no question that they do lift and tighten.  They do take a little getting used to and I was a little uncomfortable the first couple of days, but after that, you don&#x27;t really know you&#x27;re wearing them.  Until, that is, someone makes a comment - and someone ALWAYS makes a comment.  Last week my girlfriend said, &amp;#34;you&#x27;ve lost more weight, haven&#x27;t you?&amp;#34;  I told her no, that I hadn&#x27;t and she said, &amp;#34;you really look good.&amp;#34;  So I told her and showed her the tapes.  She then said, &amp;#34;THAT&#x27;s what it is - I knew something was different.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Did not realize these were refill tapes.  Not much good without the other parts</li>
    <li> These wonderful little tapes have changed my life. I use them on each side of my chin.  I  get so many compliments now on how young I look.  Mind you moisture creams or oil will cause a problem with the adhesive. Make sure you clean area with alcohol after initial cleansing and use tape to remove any residue. I HIGHLY recommend for that sagging skin on your face</li>
    <li> Great love it I will purchase again</li>
