      <li>I am so so so happy I never made that appt.</li>
      <li>So happy to have found this.</li>
      <li>A GREAT PRODUCT.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this on my face and neck and it works great</li>
      <li>Good protection barrier</li>
      <li>My dermatologist prescribed me Drysol and it didn&#x27;t seem to work as good as Hydrosal.</li>
      <li>Worked good when I didn&#x27;t rash out or shave, but.....</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>LOVE this!</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>so amazingly well.</li>
      <li>The absolute best antiperspirant I have used.</li>
      <li>After the first use i was in love worked great, and best part is, i only use it once or every month.</li>
      <li>it worked for me like a magic</li>
      <li>This product worked okay, but not as well as Dri-sol.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>- so I wasn&#x27;t too sure this product would help her.</li>
      <li>Oh, and follow the instructions on the box.  :-)</li>
      <li>I really really really love hydrosal</li>
      <li>frankly it&#x27;s the best anti-perspirant and deordorant possible and frankly has saved me from what was becoming severe embarrassment at work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, and I am eternally grateful.</li>
      <li>I put it on my forehead at the hairline, at the nape of my neck up into the hairline, and upper lip (attractive, huh?)</li>
      <li>I rarely write a review but had to for this product, just in case this changes someone&#x27;s mind and helps them!</li>
      <li>Was originally sold this product at the office of a dermatologist, at his recommendation.  </li>
      <li>The bottle is not user friendly and I recomend botox if your insurance covers it</li>
      <li>not only is Hydrosal much more cost effective, there are no scary side affects and it wors</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you enough how excited I am to finally be able to wear light colored shirts again.</li>
      <li>It has worked very well for me, after trying just about everything out there, and it has worked well for my son, who is a hormone filled teenager.  </li>
      <li>, I have also recommended this product to patients and have had success there too.  </li>
      <li>it was worth it.</li>
      <li>One of the big advantages with this product (besides being effective) is it does not burn like Drysol, SweatBlock and the others.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s worth the irritation for a day.</li>
      <li>but after that stung so much and really didn&#x27;t see huge difference.</li>
      <li>This is the only thing I&#x27;ve been able to find to help hyperhidrosis without a prescription.  </li>
      <li>first day went well</li>
      <li>It stung just a bit and for about 15 minutes the first 4-5 times I used it, then stopped all together.</li>
      <li>If you are a sweater and need help try this first.</li>
      <li>but I am sure each person is different.</li>
      <li>But I may be unique as the other reviews were much better</li>
      <li>There is a slightly higher up front cost, however one bottle lasts me 5-6 months.</li>
      <li>She doesn&#x27;t use it all the time - just when she wants to wear something new or special</li>
      <li>I still feel hot and feel like my body wants to seat</li>
      <li>She talks of shopping for new clothing - of being able to wear all the cute clothes she didn&#x27;t even think of wearing in the past.</li>
      <li>Make sure to apply at bedtime and let dry before your head hits the pillow.</li>
      <li>, It is a lot better than Certain Dri &amp; Dry Sol.</li>
      <li>Really helps.  </li>
      <li>I no longer sweat as much has caused my bod temperature to reset itself somehow.</li>
      <li>I was really worried about drippy hands at the interview.</li>
      <li>Like many of the other reviewers</li>
      <li>My daughter and I use it mainly in the not summer days.</li>
      <li>I just thought since it was a bit more on the pricier side it might have a better effect, but I was wrong.</li>
      <li>My teenage daughter just got a sample of this product from a doctor and its the first thing that really works.</li>
      <li>Only recommendation I have is to not shave right before you put the gel on because it can irritate your skin.</li>
      <li>I looked to see if there was anything new on the market</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s because of the salicylic acid, which is absorbed readily by the face compared to other carriers.</li>
      <li>I did some more research and stumbled on Hydrosal and liked the fact that it was was a gel base designed not to be so irritable.</li>
      <li>Anyway, it finally started to become a real problem at work, and I was literally putting paper towels inside my shirts to mop up sweat, and sometimes changing shirts two or three times a day.</li>
      <li>The product works but my underarms are very itchy the next day.</li>
      <li>if used after shaving (which is only time you can use it really).  </li>
      <li>but only if it didn&#x27;t sting so much...</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend this product first one that I have found that actually works!</li>
      <li>After one full week of applying the gel to my hairline all the way around my head including forehead and around ears, i mean truly around the entire hairline right into the hair, I no longer sweat there.</li>
      <li>I wore a short sleeved light green shirt all day</li>
      <li>Amazing; this works when everything else fails.  </li>
      <li>a medical professional</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s taken about a week of creaming the area multiple times a day to get back to normal.</li>
      <li>My whole closet is black clothes because they don&#x27;t  show the stain that  eventually ensue once I am out and about.</li>

<li> My whole closet is black clothes because they don&#x27;t  show the stain that  eventually ensue once I am out and about.</li>
<li> I tried it - following the instructions and literally smearing no more than a small pea sized amount on my underarms, and pretty much the next day I noticed a massive improvement as my sweating slowed and then stopped.</li>
<li> Scalp and facial sweating have really increased for me in the past couple of years.</li>
<li> I can never wear my hair down in the summer because it gets wet and frizzy and curly from sweating so much</li>
<li> My hair was dry, no sweat on my lip and my hands were much dryer than usual.  </li>
<li> It does cause some irritation, of my left underarm only, strangely enough, but it has made enough of a difference in my sweating that it&#x27;s a small price to pay.&lt;br</li>
<li> but it was a complete waste of money for me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve even tried underarm Botox and that only lasts 2 months and is super expensive.</li>
<li> and I stayed dry!</li>
<li> I was recommended this product by a top dermotoligist only to be disappointed by the outcome.  </li>
<li> I found that my hands became very dry.  </li>
<li> I use it for facial sweating on my forehead and upper lip and it works for at least 3 days in between uses.</li>
<li> I stopped using it for a few days and found that I went back to my baseline perspiration after 2 days.  </li>
<li> After doing some research and reading reviews I thought that this would help with my Hyperhidrosis but not much.</li>
<li> I can wear my hair down and nothing, dry as a bone.</li>
<li> Maybe it will work for other people</li>
<li> Made me sweat even more. :(</li>
<li> It dried my skin out a little initially, but I got used to it, and boy</li>
<li> Very expensive, but worth it to stay dry.</li>
<li> I was allergic to all deodorants and even recently reacted to the hard salt type deodorants as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I purchased this for my college age daughter who has hid for years under dark, baggy clothing.</li>
<li> I now also seem to run a little &#x27;cooler&#x27; - I think the fact</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year now.</li>
<li> My skin dried out a little</li>
<li> It dried the skin and made it scaly.</li>
<li> The only mistake i made was putting the gel on my lower neck where the skin on women is thin.</li>
<li> Works like a charm, read and follow directions closely, it will burn the first time but nothing bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awesome! Must have for a man</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m another one with hyperhidrosis.  Agony as a teenager, embarrassing as an adult and getting worse with menopause (sorry boys).  Scalp and facial sweating have really increased for me in the past couple of years. I have recently made a career change and went on a big interview earlier this week.  I was really worried about drippy hands at the interview. I looked to see if there was anything new on the market and I found one I hadn&#x27;t tried.  I started using Hydrosal a week before the interview on my hands.  I put it on my forehead at the hairline, at the nape of my neck up into the hairline, and upper lip (attractive, huh?) 4 days prior to the interview.  I was worried about it being irritating to my face and it was not.  It worked!  My hair was dry, no sweat on my lip and my hands were much dryer than usual.  Like many of the other reviewers I found that my hands became very dry.  I had the feeling that I was going to perspire but I didn&#x27;t.  I stopped using it for a few days and found that I went back to my baseline perspiration after 2 days.  One of the big advantages with this product (besides being effective) is it does not burn like Drysol, SweatBlock and the others.  There must be something to the gel.</li>
    <li> did not work at all!!</li>
    <li> have used it for years. My daughter and I use it mainly in the not summer days. Nothing beats this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 weeks with no results. My skin dried out a little but im as sweaty and clammy as ever.</li>
    <li> I had a really bad and embarrassing sweating problem and this product totally fixed it! Thank you! IT&#x27;S THE BEST!!!</li>
    <li> I really really really love hydrosal it worked for me like a magic and I am still using it.</li>
    <li> It makes me rash out :(  if used after shaving (which is only time you can use it really).  Worked good when I didn&#x27;t rash out or shave, but.....</li>
    <li> This product worked okay, but not as well as Dri-sol. I will be returning to Dri-Sol.</li>
    <li> I started suffering from excessive underarm sweating in my 40s for some reason, although I&#x27;d always been on the sweaty side. Anyway, it finally started to become a real problem at work, and I was literally putting paper towels inside my shirts to mop up sweat, and sometimes changing shirts two or three times a day. I then did some research and found driclor, but since it&#x27;s alcohol based, it stings and can be quite uncomfortable, although it did work. I did some more research and stumbled on Hydrosal and liked the fact that it was was a gel base designed not to be so irritable. I tried it - following the instructions and literally smearing no more than a small pea sized amount on my underarms, and pretty much the next day I noticed a massive improvement as my sweating slowed and then stopped. After putting it on for 3 or 4 nights in a row, I now only put it on one night a week, and then it seems to work all week - frankly it&#x27;s the best anti-perspirant and deordorant possible and frankly has saved me from what was becoming severe embarrassment at work. I now also seem to run a little &#x27;cooler&#x27; - I think the fact I no longer sweat as much has caused my bod temperature to reset itself somehow. Anyway, this product is a godsend and works.</li>
    <li> A GREAT PRODUCT.  I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE WHO NEED IT.</li>
    <li> Amazing; this works when everything else fails.  I&#x27;ve even tried underarm Botox and that only lasts 2 months and is super expensive.</li>
    <li> I have had sweating problem ever since I hit my puberty.. This product does wonders! My dermatologist prescribed me Drysol and it didn&#x27;t seem to work as good as Hydrosal. I am happy with my results! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Good protection barrier</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve been able to find to help hyperhidrosis without a prescription.  Very expensive, but worth it to stay dry.</li>
    <li> Made me sweat even more. :(</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I used to use iontophoroses homemade iontophoresis machine to cure my sweaty hands. It worked. But it hurt and took 25 minutes every day and was embarrassing and did nothing to help my sweaty feet cause I couldn&#x27;t afford to do it for 50 minutes a day. Anyways. I&#x27;ve used this 3 times and my feet have stopped sweating and my hands aren&#x27;t. LOVE this!</li>
    <li> Has worked for me for years.  I do itch after it is on but no sweat and that&#x27;s worth the irritation for a day.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Would definitely recommend this product first one that I have found that actually works! It took about a week to start working for me but I am sure each person is different.</li>
    <li> The absolute best antiperspirant I have used. I use it for facial sweating on my forehead and upper lip and it works for at least 3 days in between uses. I have tried Odoban, Sweatblock, and this stuff, and this is the best of all 3. I think it&#x27;s because of the salicylic acid, which is absorbed readily by the face compared to other carriers. There is a slightly higher up front cost, however one bottle lasts me 5-6 months. I&#x27;ve been using Hydrosal for 4 years now and it has changed my life!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year now. I can&#x27;t tell you enough how excited I am to finally be able to wear light colored shirts again. I had tried all kinds of clinical strength deordorants to no avail. It took a couple days for this to start working. For some reason I was thinking it would be an overnight sensation. After using it for the first time I still had excessive amounts of sweat and I was feeling severly disapointed. I decided I&#x27;d give it a week before throwing in the towel. After about three nights of applying the product it finally worked.</li>
    <li> Amazing. I am a serious neck, head and face sweater. I can never wear my hair down in the summer because it gets wet and frizzy and curly from sweating so much and I look like I just worked out, it&#x27;s gross. I was researching about ways to stop my sweating and was about to make an appt for Botox injections when I read about Hydrosal Gel. I am so so so happy I never made that appt. not only is Hydrosal much more cost effective, there are no scary side affects and it wors so amazingly well. After one full week of applying the gel to my hairline all the way around my head including forehead and around ears, i mean truly around the entire hairline right into the hair, I no longer sweat there. I still feel hot and feel like my body wants to seat but it doesn&#x27;t. I can wear my hair down and nothing, dry as a bone. The only mistake i made was putting the gel on my lower neck where the skin on women is thin. It is not suppose to go there at all and I decided to try it. It dried the skin and made it scaly. it&#x27;s taken about a week of creaming the area multiple times a day to get back to normal. I will only apply to places it is suppose to be. If you are a sweater and need help try this first. It stung just a bit and for about 15 minutes the first 4-5 times I used it, then stopped all together. Make sure to apply at bedtime and let dry before your head hits the pillow.</li>
    <li> I had the highest hopes this would help me with my excessive sweating on my scalp and face. I did stop sweating there after about five days of use but ended up with such unbearable itching and burning I had to stop using it. I am so so sad. :(</li>
    <li> After doing some research and reading reviews I thought that this would help with my Hyperhidrosis but not much. I would still sweat, It is a lot better than Certain Dri &amp; Dry Sol. I just thought since it was a bit more on the pricier side it might have a better effect, but I was wrong. I&#x27;m now looking into botox injections instead.</li>
    <li> I was allergic to all deodorants and even recently reacted to the hard salt type deodorants as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was prescribed this and it worked.  I did find it best to wipe off the residual application immediately after application to avoid any reaction.  It is a marriage saver (smile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added, FYI, I don&#x27;t think mine is \\&quot;the professional\\&quot; grade as this seems to say.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my college age daughter who has hid for years under dark, baggy clothing. She had to always wear t-shirts under her clothing and had to change them multiple times a day. She sweats because of anxiety - so I wasn&#x27;t too sure this product would help her. But it works! She is so very happy now. She talks of shopping for new clothing - of being able to wear all the cute clothes she didn&#x27;t even think of wearing in the past. She doesn&#x27;t use it all the time - just when she wants to wear something new or special - that&#x27;s what works for her. This has changed her life and boosted her self-esteem! Try it ... it might be the answer for you, too!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm, read and follow directions closely, it will burn the first time but nothing bad. After the first use i was in love worked great, and best part is, i only use it once or every month.</li>
    <li> I struggled forever with sweaty feet. This product has saved me a ton of embarrassment and allowed me to wear heels again. It dried my skin out a little initially, but I got used to it, and boy it was worth it. Just remember to wash your hands afterwards or it dries out skin on fingers. It&#x27;s fantastic, and I am eternally grateful.</li>
    <li> Works! I had been getting a prescription for drysol but this works just as well and doesn&#x27;t need a prescription.</li>
    <li> Really helps.  My daughter uses this at night and regular deodorant in the morning.</li>
    <li> Was originally sold this product at the office of a dermatologist, at his recommendation.  It worked well for my son and I both so I decided to find a cheaper way to get it.  Voila, Amazon!  It has worked very well for me, after trying just about everything out there, and it has worked well for my son, who is a hormone filled teenager.  It does cause some irritation, of my left underarm only, strangely enough, but it has made enough of a difference in my sweating that it&#x27;s a small price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;As a medical professional, I have also recommended this product to patients and have had success there too.  Take the poor reviews with a grain of salt, it&#x27;s something that you have to try to see if it works for you.  It may just change your life!  Oh, and follow the instructions on the box.  :-)</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter just got a sample of this product from a doctor and its the first thing that really works. She has had a horrible time with underarm moisture and tried so many products. So happy to have found this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my face and neck and it works great but only if it didn&#x27;t sting so much...</li>
    <li> Miracle gel.  I can finally where colored t-shirts!</li>
    <li> I rarely write a review but had to for this product, just in case this changes someone&#x27;s mind and helps them! I&#x27;ve always had excessive underarm sweat. My whole closet is black clothes because they don&#x27;t  show the stain that  eventually ensue once I am out and about. I just bought this product, and I followed the instructions. Although I wanted to try it out immediately I waited for bedtime like it says and smeared the gel on my arm pits. It says it can take up to a week to work but it helped the next day already! I wore a short sleeved light green shirt all day and I stayed dry! I&#x27;ve been putting it on every night before bed and and after night 7 it says to use as needed. Absolutely love this product! Only recommendation I have is to not shave right before you put the gel on because it can irritate your skin. Hope this review was helpful!</li>
    <li> Does this product work? Yes.  Does this product sting and burn and itch so badly that I have to stop using it? Yes.  Sorry to say folks, if you have tried other products that burn like crazy this one (although they claim not to) still hurts so bad that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This product was very expensive and just didn&#x27;t work at all. Maybe it will work for other people but it was a complete waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> Gave my son a red rash</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a top dermotoligist only to be disappointed by the outcome.  The bottle is not user friendly and I recomend botox if your insurance covers it</li>
    <li> first day went well but after that stung so much and really didn&#x27;t see huge difference. But I may be unique as the other reviews were much better</li>
    <li> The product works but my underarms are very itchy the next day.</li>
</ol>
