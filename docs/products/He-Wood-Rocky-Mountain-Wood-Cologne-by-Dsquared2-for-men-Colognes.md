      <li>Smells okay.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>LOVE all the Dsquared fragrances</li>
      <li>I hesitate to write a review because this is one of the most underrated colognes on the market.</li>
      <li>Hints of cedar and musk send you to a more primal visceral landscape where men carved out civilization from the crucible of their minds and</li>
      <li>Years ago my favorite cologne was Gucci Rush for men.</li>
      <li>Of course this time I wanna make sure that I test before buying it.</li>
      <li>This is now my favorite scent for the Fall and Winter.  </li>
      <li>It comes in a glass bottle encased in wood which I also love.</li>
      <li>and it is okay</li>
      <li>I took 2 sprays on my wrist and a piece of paper then went for a stroll for an hour and more, sniffing my wrist and the paper.</li>
      <li>and I love the sent on him.</li>
      <li>It has a beautiful masculine scent.</li>
      <li>When I first smelled it thought, Woow, this sounds really good and like wood.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my taste, fresh scent, woody, spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for winter, and I&#x27;m sill using it in the spring and most likely will be using it in the summer too.</li>
      <li>Tried the original wood and looks like they both are pretty good</li>
      <li>Read here that some people say this is strong</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s too strong to wear, felt like vomiting.</li>
      <li>and it is not to strong where it will make you gag</li>
      <li>but it isn&#x27;t light either to where you won&#x27;t even notice it.</li>
      <li>This cologne is honestly fantastic.</li>
      <li>and it adds a good undertone to your natural scent.</li>
      <li>It is very easy for this scent to become overbearing so do not use too much.</li>
      <li>This is an incredible man&#x27;s cologne for a \\&quot;real man\\&quot;, who could just as easily be splitting wood outside a cabin on a cool fall day as be typing on a computer.  </li>
      <li>I originally looked for it at Nordstrom because they carry the Dsquared2 brand.  </li>
      <li>It is a unique \\&quot;woody\\&quot;</li>
      <li>everyone has a unique sense of smell and this one, was not for me.</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon it during winter 2011 and am wearing it again this year because of its unique composition.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s soapy,</li>
      <li>It has a really clean smell to it</li>
      <li>This actually smells very much like the scent of fresh cut cedar, but with the addition of beautiful and smooth Vetiver.  </li>
      <li>and I sold it away to a friend whom like sweet smell.</li>
      <li>this is what I am searching for, cedar wood smell and not so sweet like Burberry Touch.</li>
      <li>It turned out to be too sweet, not my liking</li>
      <li>It is a very unique scent and cannot really be compared to anything else I&#x27;ve smelled.  </li>
      <li>home when I sprayed it on my body, comment from my wife and daughter was, \\&quot;Hmmm...so fresh, clean wood smell.</li>
      <li>This is a new top pick for me as an all day cologne.</li>
      <li>and I almost died, it gets very cloying when you&#x27;re in a stuffy environment for a long time, again great scent but use it outdoors.</li>
      <li>but it sounded like it was worth a shot.  </li>
      <li>you like this one and want something even darker and perhaps even more masculine, check out Lalique&#x27;s \\&quot;Encre</li>
      <li>Smelling the freshly fallen snow and the crispness of the mountain air.</li>
      <li>When i first saw it, i thought what a cool looking bottle (glass bottle framed in a wood).</li>
      <li>I smell like success.</li>
      <li>Masculine and sexy.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to buy this item after so much research, but was dissapointed with the smell.</li>
      <li>so I thought this might be right up his alley.</li>
      <li>I also love this fragrance because it truly smells like no other.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended to those who favourite clean and fresh woody aroma.</li>
      <li>I have tried many major shopping complexes in Kuala Lumpur (I live in  Malaysia)and even at the airport duty free shops, and still in vain.</li>
      <li>This by far my favorite cologne, it&#x27;s not too strong and overpowering but last all day.</li>
      <li>Very masculine, fresh, and bold.</li>
      <li>Many compliments, and since its just a general interesting and pleasing smell it comes off as non offensive (so long as you don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>But I find that being in a hot and humid country I need to spray quite a bit.</li>
      <li>She wasn&#x27;t sure but started searching in the store and finally she took out He Wood Rocky Mountain of 100 ml content, asking me \\&quot;Is</li>
      <li>We finally found our favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>Many reviews compared Rocky Mountain Wood to Rush saying it was similar.</li>
      <li>put more into it lasting longer.</li>
      <li>Ask your girlfriend/boyfriend first.</li>
      <li>A very strong smell like that of fresh cut cedar with other lighter notes make this feel like a log cabin in the mountains.</li>
      <li>Very clean and masculine but with a soft finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But when I wear this fragrance I walk a little more confident, with a little more weight, a little more freedom.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>The name Rocky Mountain Wood really does it justice because it&#x27;s almost like being on a mountaintop.</li>
      <li>So much so that I&#x27;m considering buying another bottle just in case they stop selling it.</li>
      <li>Thanks to DSquared2.</li>
      <li>I work in the fragrance department at an upscale department store and can say this scent really stands apart from the rest.</li>
      <li>BUT...i&#x27;m sure other people will like this sent.</li>
      <li>does not last long for the price nice bottle.</li>
      <li>but I had to write a review for this one because it is hands down my favorite fragrance of the winter.</li>
      <li>Imagine my disappointment after opening this beautifully packaged bottle and spraying it on my skin and the first thing I smell is a synthetic floral.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, anyone can appreciate this cologne and I would highly recommend buying it and trying it out.</li>
      <li>Smells like nothing else, very unusual, distinctive, masculine natural scent that doesn&#x27;t precede you into the room.</li>
      <li>This is a very woody scent, but not in an \\&quot;old man\\&quot; way.  </li>
      <li>it is a very mellow and masculine scent</li>
      <li>I love this scent, the white pepper really sets it apart, but wear it outside, like on a short hike or something.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was so excited to buy this item after so much research, but was dissapointed with the smell. it&#x27;s too strong to wear, felt like vomiting. worst buy ever.</li>
    <li> Lots of great &amp;#34;feedback&amp;#34; every time I wear it.  Masculine and sexy.  I highly recommend this as well as any other of their fragrances.</li>
    <li> LOVE all the Dsquared fragrances but THIS one knock all others out of the park!!  Fragrance appropriate from late fall thru winter...</li>
    <li> It smells delicious. Not too sweet, just like I prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;The 2 stars are for the awkward bottle design and because the scent doesn&#x27;t linger. Not even a bit. I think you&#x27;d have to shower with it to make it last longer than 1 minute, and that&#x27;s just not very desirable, now is it?</li>
    <li> For me, it&#x27;s the best cologne ever !  I just hope they won&#x27;t stop producing it !!!  Thanks to DSquared2.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my taste, fresh scent, woody, spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for winter, and I&#x27;m sill using it in the spring and most likely will be using it in the summer too.</li>
    <li> from good reviews of this product i was sure i was going to like the woody sent. WRONG! sorry to say but i only got the sent of Raid. definitely not what i was expecting. everyone has a unique sense of smell and this one, was not for me. i would never recommend this cologne BUT...i&#x27;m sure other people will like this sent.</li>
    <li> Smells okay. Ask your girlfriend/boyfriend first.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and he loves it. Its not over powering- it smells like a cedar chest. &lt;3 it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad because he likes to have the latest and greatest.  I originally looked for it at Nordstrom because they carry the Dsquared2 brand.  They didn&#x27;t have it but the fancy salesguy assured me it had to be good.  It smelled so good I had to get one for myself.</li>
    <li> This is it. We finally found our favorite perfume. No more disappointment! It came in small bottles. Perfect for travelers.</li>
    <li> I blind bought this because of the reviews from Fragrantica, Basenotes, Sephora and Amazon. Years ago my favorite cologne was Gucci Rush for men. Gucci stopped making it probably because sandalwood has become super rare and is super expensive. I was looking for a substitute with that same woody flavor. Many reviews compared Rocky Mountain Wood to Rush saying it was similar. It&#x27;s not. Imagine my disappointment after opening this beautifully packaged bottle and spraying it on my skin and the first thing I smell is a synthetic floral. It vaguely smells of wood and feels sticky on my skin. The dry down smells powdery and completely synthetic. For me it&#x27;s not a masculine scent at all. I wanted to return it but Amazon doesn&#x27;t take back colognes for some reason. I&#x27;ll continue to wear it until I run out. To state the obvious, I won&#x27;t be buying it again. Thank God it doesn&#x27;t last long on your skin.    If you&#x27;re looking for a nice woody scent I&#x27;d go with Art OF Shaving&#x27;s Sandalwood. It has a beautiful masculine scent. Another is Wonderwood by Commes Des Garcons, but it&#x27;s super expensive.    ***UPDATE*** 10/7/14  I HATE THIS $-HIT!!!!!   DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Product according to purchased. Recommend it met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time or even earlier. Well I recommend, met my expectations.</li>
    <li> I bough it for a friend, He&#x27;s very happy with it. Smell keep all day long. Going to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Like all the other reviews. A very strong smell like that of fresh cut cedar with other lighter notes make this feel like a log cabin in the mountains. Very masculine, fresh, and bold. This is a new top pick for me as an all day cologne. Sillage and longevity are great! Lasts most of the day and every time I get a small whiff of it I wish I could just as soon get another. Many compliments, and since its just a general interesting and pleasing smell it comes off as non offensive (so long as you don&#x27;t over-do it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, the white pepper really sets it apart, but wear it outside, like on a short hike or something. I made the mistake of wearing it to school once and I almost died, it gets very cloying when you&#x27;re in a stuffy environment for a long time, again great scent but use it outdoors.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas present for my BF. He loves the smell of wood so I thought this might be right up his alley. He likes it a lot and I love the sent on him. It comes in a glass bottle encased in wood which I also love. I&#x27;m going to order another of the wood scents for his Birthday!</li>
    <li> Great smell. Lasts a good period of time. Isn&#x27;t too powerful or weak. I wear it whenever I go out.</li>
    <li> This cologne is honestly fantastic. It has a really clean smell to it and it is not to strong where it will make you gag but it isn&#x27;t light either to where you won&#x27;t even notice it. In my opinion, anyone can appreciate this cologne and I would highly recommend buying it and trying it out. It also makes a great gift because it is an easy smell that so many people will like.</li>
    <li> I hesitate to write a review because this is one of the most underrated colognes on the market. It has awesomness redefined!&lt;br /&gt;shhhhhh</li>
    <li> best fragrance I&#x27;ve smelt by Hermes. Love it</li>
    <li> Smells like nothing else, very unusual, distinctive, masculine natural scent that doesn&#x27;t precede you into the room. The natural scent blends in well with surroundings even if over applied, and nobody will wonder if its you they smell or the lady next to you.</li>
    <li> This is a very woody scent, but not in an \\&quot;old man\\&quot; way.  This actually smells very much like the scent of fresh cut cedar, but with the addition of beautiful and smooth Vetiver.  This is an incredible man&#x27;s cologne for a \\&quot;real man\\&quot;, who could just as easily be splitting wood outside a cabin on a cool fall day as be typing on a computer.  Ladies, if you want a scent that will have you wanting to bury your head in your man&#x27;s chest, this is probably it (as long as you like the forest and think your guy can pull this off).&lt;br /&gt;Evokes mental images of a moist ancient forest and the color of redwood, cool but not cold, seemingly empty but with life hiding in each and every nook and cranny.&lt;br /&gt;Age range: 21-100.&lt;br /&gt;If you like this one and want something even darker and perhaps even more masculine, check out Lalique&#x27;s \\&quot;Encre Noir\\&quot; also on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any women who has a man who works in a corporate setting but loves getting his hands dirty at home and loves the great outdoors.</li>
    <li> I spray this once in the morning on my neck and the scent lasts all day. I get complements on it from women and even some men it is a very mellow and masculine scent and it adds a good undertone to your natural scent. It is very easy for this scent to become overbearing so do not use too much.</li>
    <li> This by far my favorite cologne, it&#x27;s not too strong and overpowering but last all day. I really like the subtle tones of wood throughout. I get nothing but compliments about this smells.</li>
    <li> I got this for my partner becuase they stop selling it at Sephora. When i first saw it, i thought what a cool looking bottle (glass bottle framed in a wood). When I first smelled it thought, Woow, this sounds really good and like wood. I sprayed it on her and it smelled amazing. Also, I purchased Wood for her. It smells good, but I like the men version better.</li>
    <li> does not last long for the price nice bottle. put more into it lasting longer. and lower the price. thanks</li>
    <li> I was sceptical purchasing this perfume.Prior to this, without testing and base on user reviews in the net,I bought a Burberry Touch. It turned out to be too sweet, not my liking and I sold it away to a friend whom like sweet smell. Woody fragrance smell is one of my favourite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I surfed around, I end up with this He Wood not deciding to take the Rocky mountain or the basic one. Of course this time I wanna make sure that I test before buying it. Now the biggest challenge is sampling. As not many counters have it and not many sale personnel are aware of Dsquared2 He Wood Perfume. I have tried many major shopping complexes in Kuala Lumpur (I live in  Malaysia)and even at the airport duty free shops, and still in vain. Next I tried searching in Vivo City Singapore, still there aren&#x27;t any, and many sale personnel are not familiar with Dsquared2 product. Well. I almost gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until...as I strolled along the People Park Complex in Chinatown of Singapore, came across a little small cubicle outlet with the shop name \\&quot;Perfume bar\\&quot; on the 2nd floor stacked up with various brand of perfumes, and I told myself \\&quot;Why don&#x27;t I ask if they have He Wood?\\&quot; As usual, the sales girl told me that they have never heard of He Wood. And I replied, \\&quot;Its okay\\&quot;. As I looked around those shelves, out of sudden I spotted She Wood for ladies.Again, I asked her \\&quot;I am looking for this perfume that is made for men call He Wood. Do you have any?\\&quot;. She wasn&#x27;t sure but started searching in the store and finally she took out He Wood Rocky Mountain of 100 ml content, asking me \\&quot;Is this the one that you are looking for, Sir?\\&quot;. And I said \\&quot;Yes,hmm...can I sample it before buying?\\&quot;. She replied \\&quot;Sir, We do not have a tester, but you may open up the bottle and test it and it is okay I you do not wish to buy\\&quot;. That was nice of her. I took 2 sprays on my wrist and a piece of paper then went for a stroll for an hour and more, sniffing my wrist and the paper. Bingo! this is what I am searching for, cedar wood smell and not so sweet like Burberry Touch. Went back to the shop and purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back home when I sprayed it on my body, comment from my wife and daughter was, \\&quot;Hmmm...so fresh, clean wood smell. What is that?\\&quot;. \\&quot;Its Rocky Mountain He Wood\\&quot; I said. Well, no regret with this purchase. Highly recommended to those who favourite clean and fresh woody aroma.</li>
    <li> This it the kind of scent that men need. The kind of scent that can only be described as Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s late night ale-fueled fights with wildlife being painted by Norman Rockwell. It&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s soapy, it&#x27;s peppery and it&#x27;s a raw. It conveys the name: Rocky Mountain Wood. Hints of cedar and musk send you to a more primal visceral landscape where men carved out civilization from the crucible of their minds and earth-caked hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a blind buy for me. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. But when I wear this fragrance I walk a little more confident, with a little more weight, a little more freedom. Ten-feet tall and staggering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wear this fragrance I smell like success.</li>
    <li> great fresh scent. Women seem to like it on me.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for fragrances but I had to write a review for this one because it is hands down my favorite fragrance of the winter. I stumbled upon it during winter 2011 and am wearing it again this year because of its unique composition. The name Rocky Mountain Wood really does it justice because it&#x27;s almost like being on a mountaintop. Smelling the freshly fallen snow and the crispness of the mountain air. Very clean and masculine but with a soft finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried both the He Wood and Rocky Mountain Wood and this version won me over hands down. So much so that I&#x27;m considering buying another bottle just in case they stop selling it. I also love this fragrance because it truly smells like no other. I work in the fragrance department at an upscale department store and can say this scent really stands apart from the rest. The only thing I would change is that because it&#x27;s an eau de toilette it doesn&#x27;t linger nearly as long as I would like. If they made this in an eau de parfum I&#x27;d be in heaven... on that mountaintop every day of my winter months here in L.A.</li>
    <li> I purchased a bottle of DSquared2 He Wood Rocky Mountain Woods blindly a few weeks ago.  I heard some mixed reviews online but it sounded like it was worth a shot.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!  This is now my favorite scent for the Fall and Winter.  It is a very unique scent and cannot really be compared to anything else I&#x27;ve smelled.  It is a unique \\&quot;woody\\&quot; that isn&#x27;t like the other more traditional or literal wood scents.  If you&#x27;re looking for a change of pace from the mainstream scents that everyone else at school or the office are wearing -- try DSquared2 He Wood Rocky Mountain Woods!</li>
    <li> Unique and rather long lasting. Lots of people say it smells nice but yet not overpowering. Read here that some people say this is strong and I should only use a little. But I find that being in a hot and humid country I need to spray quite a bit. The bottle&#x27;s design makes it a bit hard to use though but that&#x27;s a small issue.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended if you want something natural. Doesn&#x27;t smell as &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; as I had preferred it to be though.</li>
    <li> REally Nice. EVeryone compliments on the smell and its just good. Tried the original wood and looks like they both are pretty good but i think i favor this one more.</li>
