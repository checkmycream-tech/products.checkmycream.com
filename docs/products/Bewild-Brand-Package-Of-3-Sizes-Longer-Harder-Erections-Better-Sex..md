      <li>Price is not bad either.</li>
      <li>Shipped very fast and seem to be durable.  </li>
      <li>Unless u have a really phat one don&#x27;t buy this, material</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably the combination of size and the nitrile material which is pliant enough to be able to stretch on and off but firm enough to really provide the constriction that makes these thiings worthwhile.  </li>
      <li>These cock-rings are of good-quality nitrile and will last a long time if you keep them clean and degreased...</li>

<li> They would be ok but for me the biggest one was too big and the other two were too small.  </li>
<li> Very minimal elasticity and uncomfortable, it&#x27;s more like a super hard rubber.</li>
<li> I am not sure, really.</li>
<li> Wish the smaller one was a little smaller</li>
<li> Be careful.</li>
<li> a silicone cock-ring is a waste of money if you&#x27;re looking for something that will last)...</li>
<li> It looks like it was partially opened or perhaps someone tried to reclose the package before shipping it to us.</li>
<li> The other two smaller rings are perfect for the base of the c--k and balls and one at the base of your shaft.</li>
<li> found them to be a bit too stiff and not very flexible at least for my taste.</li>
<li> sucks ahhhh waist of money</li>
<li> False advertising, that is just a reflection, they are just 20 cent o-rings.</li>
<li> The package was bent dirty and covered with dust.</li>
<li> k and balls base than me.</li>

    <li> They would be ok but for me the biggest one was too big and the other two were too small.  I can&#x27;t fault the sellers for that though because everyone is different.  Shipped very fast and seem to be durable.  Maybe I can use it as an o-ring for something in the garage.....</li>
    <li> Very minimal elasticity and uncomfortable, it&#x27;s more like a super hard rubber.</li>
    <li> found them to be a bit too stiff and not very flexible at least for my taste.</li>
    <li> Wish the smaller one was a little smaller but they work.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised. On time delivery.</li>
    <li> Rock out wit cock out</li>
    <li> Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This cock-ring is made of nitrile and doesn&#x27;t disintegrate like silicone ones do when using oil-based lubricants...(buying a silicone cock-ring is a waste of money if you&#x27;re looking for something that will last)...These cock-rings are of good-quality nitrile and will last a long time if you keep them clean and degreased...they come in 3 sizes and one of them is sure to fit you perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love it! very comfortable great product</li>
    <li> OK, this is a rave review.  I have dozens of c--k rings, metal, rubber, neoprene, etc.  Some are solid, some have push joints, some snap.  These provide the best sensations of any that I&#x27;ve tried. Why?  I am not sure, really. It&#x27;s probably the combination of size and the nitrile material which is pliant enough to be able to stretch on and off but firm enough to really provide the constriction that makes these thiings worthwhile.  The biggest ring, of course, is for someone waaay bigger at the c--k and balls base than me. Throw it away or put it on your neighbor&#x27;s bull. The other two smaller rings are perfect for the base of the c--k and balls and one at the base of your shaft. A great sensation for anyone who loves to edge for hours as I do.</li>
    <li> False advertising, that is just a reflection, they are just 20 cent o-rings.</li>
    <li> She likes it......LOL</li>
    <li> Arrived Right On Time And Look Just As Advertised!</li>
    <li> works good enough.&lt;br /&gt;i suppose it does what its supposed to</li>
    <li> Came as billed.  Cheap, effective, delivered timely</li>
    <li> Adds noticeable size but caused a vein to rupture. Be careful.</li>
    <li> good material and good shipping speed</li>
    <li> The package was bent dirty and covered with dust. It looks like it was partially opened or perhaps someone tried to reclose the package before shipping it to us.</li>
    <li> Middle on fits great. Price is not bad either.</li>
    <li> Well I have no need for the smallest one. But the other two come in handy. :P</li>
    <li> Unless u have a really phat one don&#x27;t buy this, material sucks ahhhh waist of money</li>
