      <li>My husband also reacts badly to strong perfume.</li>

      <li>Goes on smoothly and seems to help.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the fragrance, very spicy!  </li>
      <li>Since it seems that everyone says they have the best anti-aging skin cream, it&#x27;s hard to choose.</li>

      <li>It use to be flaky and peeling and times, now it is nice and smooth and dare I say, even younger looking!</li>
      <li>Everything about the cream was great, however it was so heavily perfumed</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised there isn&#x27;t  more buzz about this line.</li>
      <li>Just a reminder: my dermatologist told me I should only use Retinol during the warm months.</li>
      <li>This lovely thick cream is absorbed to the skin nicely.</li>

      <li>it is more than I expected..</li>
      <li>It is a decent night cream for its price.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than more expensive creams that I gave used.</li>
      <li>and I have to admit that more expensive products are doing a better job on my skin.</li>
      <li>It is fine, didn&#x27;t really notice any difference from my other night cream.</li>
      <li>Product seemed sort of greasy....seemed to break out my skin some after use and so far have not noticed any real difference as far a noticeable lines and wrinkles</li>
      <li>and I like how my skin feels in the morning, very soft.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive combination skin that easily can get too greasy with overly oily moisturizers or can easily dry out if the moisturizer is not thick enough.  </li>
      <li>Product is working on a 62 year old body - now I have to remember to use it.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated.</li>

      <li>So far I like it</li>

      <li>Just a plain old heavy cream - good for aging skin - moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it long enough, but the price is definitely worth it.  </li>
      <li>I have dry skin that somehow is still very acne prone somehow</li>
      <li>I have had a clear, soft, glowing face literally by the 2nd day of using!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I finally purchased a cream that works.  I have very dry skin and I have tried a number of creams and lotions, so I decided to try this one, too, with some results after just using it a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I got the day and night cream and noticed a positive difference in my skin within a week or so.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Love the product. It has made my skin a lot smoother and has helped reduce the amount of break outs I get. I also notice that my dark marks are fading. Love the stuff</li>
    <li> I LOVE the fragrance, very spicy!  Absorbs nicely…I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, but so far, so good.  Makes my skin feel just as soft as the more expensive brand in the tube.</li>
    <li> Love this line of products, non greasy formula for a great price and makes my skin glow! I use it everyday and it really lasts too! Will get More, a lady at my work noticed my skin, so she ordered some and loves it too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it because I bought it but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  It feels like I&#x27;m just putting some heavy cream on my face.</li>
    <li> Good product...but ive used better retinol products for MY skin.</li>
    <li> Very good face cream, I have been using it every night for 3 weeks and I can definitely see a difference in my skin. It use to be flaky and peeling and times, now it is nice and smooth and dare I say, even younger looking!</li>
    <li> They are as described and arrives as promised.</li>
    <li> Definitely, I would recommend this brand to anybody; it is not too oily or dry. You can feel it is a real cream.  My dark spots are getting lighter. This cream makes you look younger.</li>
    <li> Since it seems that everyone says they have the best anti-aging skin cream, it&#x27;s hard to choose. This one is great and is a good deal. I use it day and night and it makes my skin smooth, yet not greasy. I love it!</li>
    <li> I like it, helps keeping my skin from getting  wrinkles.I try to use it every day. I will reorder when I run out.</li>
    <li> Great value. I&#x27;m surprised there isn&#x27;t  more buzz about this line. My skin is so soft since using this product.</li>
    <li> Not much success and I have to admit that more expensive products are doing a better job on my skin.</li>
    <li> It is fine, didn&#x27;t really notice any difference from my other night cream.</li>
    <li> Does not resemble retinol in any shape or form.  Just a plain old heavy cream - good for aging skin - moisturizing.</li>
    <li> it works thanks seller</li>
    <li> this cream is really thick on my face. But it works great. I will buy this again. My face also feels very soft the next morning.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about six months and I love it. It is the only cream I use.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizing cream that does not make me break out( since I have acne prone skin). It does have a strong smell but I do not mind it. I am using it as a preventitive measure for wrinkles, so I do not know if it helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles but I do know that it moisturizes pretty good leaving my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Good product, but I now use a &amp;#34;greener&amp;#34; one.</li>
    <li> My face and neck look so much better just in the short time I started treatment.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive combination skin that easily can get too greasy with overly oily moisturizers or can easily dry out if the moisturizer is not thick enough.  I&#x27;ve used this for over a month now and I do notice a difference in the skin tone and the wrinkles on my forehead.  I will be re-ordering.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  it&#x27;s very rich, this container goes a long way because you really don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
    <li> Very godd product. It met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery Washington satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend This product 100%.&lt;br /&gt;Considers it in my upcoming purchases.</li>
    <li> That says it all. It apparently is essential for her comfort and beauty.  She has been using this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Goes on smoothly and seems to help.  Haven&#x27;t tried it long enough, but the price is definitely worth it.  Will re-order when its gone.</li>
    <li> Wawoooooo ..wawoooo ..and wawoooo....I love it ..it is more than I expected..the result is perfect ...sure I will order once again .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m late 20s.  So I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles or anything.  But I&#x27;ve always had blotchy, hard looking skin.  I&#x27;m in the sun a lot, I seam to just soak it up, and tan easily.  But I&#x27;ve definetly been damaged. Anyway, this in only a month has done wonders!! I have dry skin that somehow is still very acne prone somehow and this cream is perfect.  I have had a clear, soft, glowing face literally by the 2nd day of using! Try it.  I never right reviews and I had to for this.</li>
    <li> This cream is very good.  It&#x27;s better than more expensive creams that I gave used. A little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t make skin oily because my skin is oily. It leaves my skin soft.</li>
    <li> It is a decent night cream for its price.  I have been using it for about a month now. It will have to take more time for me to really know. So far I like it and I like how my skin feels in the morning, very soft.</li>
    <li> Everything about the cream was great, however it was so heavily perfumed I have been unable to use it consistantly.</li>
    <li> Very rich and creamy.  Makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> This lovely thick cream is absorbed to the skin nicely. It has the highest vitamin content I can find.....BUT, BUT, BUT...the perfume is so strong it makes me cry! My husband also reacts badly to strong perfume. I tried to give it to a neighbour ...but she tried it...and said the perfume was too strong for her.</li>
    <li> Product chosen after long investigation of what works without scaring my husband in the middle of the night.  Price was excellent and product delivered faster than expected.  Product is working on a 62 year old body - now I have to remember to use it.</li>
    <li> This has worked well for me. I started with both the daydream and the night cream to give my complexion a better glow. It removed redness and scaling and also lightened 2 dark spots to where they are almost invisible. My overall skin appearance is much improved. The cream is pleasant and goes in well. I also use both on my hands for dark spots, and they are fading as well. I do not have wrinkles, but am not using it for that. Sunscreen is most important for wrinkle prevention, and the daydream has that. Love one step for both.</li>
    <li> Just a reminder: my dermatologist told me I should only use Retinol during the warm months. Retinol plus heater is too harsh for the skin.</li>
    <li> I think it helps.  I was told that it would help reverse the damage that has been done from getting sunburnt.  We will see.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment, great price, feels comfortable, non sticky, I wanted to give my feedback after I tried for a while and is great, I haven&#x27;t seen more wrinkles, the existing ones have decrease and look smoother.</li>
    <li> Product seemed sort of greasy....seemed to break out my skin some after use and so far have not noticed any real difference as far a noticeable lines and wrinkles...wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but a little disappointed in product</li>
