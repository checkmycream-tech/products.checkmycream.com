<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love the light scent of this cream, i dont like strong smells on my face especially at night when im going to bed. it runs in completely with no greasy feel or residue which is great cause who wants to wake up to a greasy face print on their pillow case. it leaves my face so nice and velvety soft even throughout the night till morning.</li>
    <li> Tried Cosmedic skincare(Hydrating night cream and Hyaluronic Acid) feel very smooth and light feeling. Will continue to order and try on</li>
    <li> The first thing I do when I purchase a beauty product that will go on my face is smell it, honestly. I have sensitive skin so anything too perfumed can be irritating. Cosmedica&#x27;s cream has a barely there scent that dissipates quickly. I was super excited when I ready the ingredients and every other word was organic. Again, important for my sensitive skin. The cream is  thick (but not greasy), which makes it a perfect night cream, though it says it can be used day and night. The cream has moisturizing  aloe, and hyaluronic acid  to hydrate plus collagen boosting vitamins C, E, and Co Q10 so that I wake with plump, glowing skin. Cosmedica&#x27;s organic cream can be smoothed all over my face and neck, including around my eyes, without burning. Add this cream to your nighttime routine for dewy-soft skin in the morning! *Discount given for my unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
    <li> This product really moisturizers my skin.  I don&#x27;t feel the tightness after cleansing anymore.  I have oily skin, and this product feels great!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice nighttime cream. It is thick enough to really hydrate your skin overnight but doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. I have not gotten any breakouts or irritation from this product. It feels very luxurious on your skin and goes on smooth. I felt that is added a really nice dose of hydration but it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. It sinks in pretty quickly too, in about 2-5 minutes. I like to use this after I cleanse, tone, and apply my serum. The packaging is very luxurious too. To me it has the feel of a $50+ night cream. Since it is summer right now I use a light hand but I think this will be prefect for the winter months when my skin is super dehydrated and I need a heavier cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for review but all opinions and experiences are my own.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use Biomec and Obagi skincare but didn&#x27;t find a moisturizer in either line that wasn&#x27;t too heavy or not quite heavy enough. This one is moisturizing and when used in conjuction with their hydraulic acid it is really a treat for your skin.</li>
    <li> Helped, I saw a difference in the first 3 days! AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I received multi- active hydrating night cream for discount price. I have only used it a few night but love the product. The cream is not oily or does not make my face oily. Also in the morning my face feels so smooth and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Gives skin a great moisturizing. Use it morning and night.Aging skin f e els softer and more nourished.</li>
    <li> Cosmedica Skincare Multi-Active Hydrating Night Cream is a keeper for me. I love the soothing, rich cream. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review. Since using it I notice my skin is brighter, maybe more even and the redness I have around my nose and mouth is not so red. It&#x27;s paraben-free, something I appreciate and uses organic ingredients to condition skin. It uses some of my favorite ingredients: Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, aloe and CoEnzyme Q10.  I like that it absorbs into my skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a stain on my pillow when I wake up. It is light weight and keeps my skin feeling youthful and looking good.</li>
    <li> Just started using this cream. It&#x27;s a bit thicker than expected and has a odor I&#x27;m not use to. Haven&#x27;t seen results yet but I will keep using it to see if it will help hydrate and keep my skin looking smooth. I&#x27;m hoping it does.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I love this! I actually use it in the morning and at night. It&#x27;s not greasy for me. I have some what oily skin. Great company, great price point!</li>
    <li> Great product. Very moisturizing. Smells a bit medicinal.</li>
    <li> Here are the highlights: Pros:&lt;br /&gt;5% Vitamin C to mildly exfoliate and rejuvenate collegan. Hydrate skin with this gentle formula that acts to repair damaged, dry, aging skin&lt;br /&gt;Key Ingredient: Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid- provides deep moisture and hydration&lt;br /&gt;Key Ingredient: Vitamin C, E, CoEnzyme Q10- promote healthy skin, cell turnover, collagen boost&lt;br /&gt;Paraben-free, no dyes, no fragrances or fillers. Not tested on Animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Couldn&#x27;t really find any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great night cream. Silky- softly scented. made my skin very soft. very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is not greasy and I find it very effective/</li>
    <li> I like the feel of it.  Whether it renders miracles, only time will tell!</li>
    <li> This Multi-acting hydrating cream has worked great on my skin! I had been on the beach all day and had burned my face, neck, and chest area and wondered if this facial cream would help out my burn. I read the ingredients and it stated that it had aloe and hyaluronic acid in it so I applied it to my sensitive areas before bed. Immediately I felt a soothing effect and was able to get to sleep comfortably. I woke up in the morning expecting to still have a burn and I noticed that I just had a nice tan and my skin was very dewy and hydrated. The aloe and hyaluronic acid really locked in the moisture.  ( A single molecule of HA can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, binding moisture to help soften, smooth, tone and rehydrate skin.) I am really thankful to have found this product and will continue to use it daily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a sample or discounted. I did not have to give a good review. The opinions expressed are unbiased and my own.</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream! You can use in the day and at night. It comes in a 2 oz jar, but a little goes a long way. It contains several powerful ingredients such as Vitamin C, E, and CoEnzyme Q10, Hyaluronic Acid, and aloe. It&#x27;s has a nice scent, and it&#x27;s absorbs quickly into your skin. It&#x27;s light on your face, and is not greasy. I have very dry skin and it&#x27;s good at moisturizing my skin but without the oiliness. I normally use after cleansing my face, and after my skin feels rejuvenated, and looks radiant. I recommended this if you want something that won&#x27;t clog your pores, but hydrant your skin, and leave your skin glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> After using this hydrating night cream I noticed such drastic change in my face. It feels smoother and my dry spots went away. I love this product. Glad I was able to try it with the discounted price. I&#x27;m ready to get more.</li>
    <li> This night cream is amazing.  The first thing I noticed was how thick and creamy it is.  It is very soft and hydrating.  It absorbs easily into my skin and doesn&#x27;t  leave a greasy feeling on my skin at all.  It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance which is important to me.  I have sensitive skin that is easily aggravated and this works great.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after continued use of this cream.  I love it.  I was provided a sample for free to test and review.</li>
    <li> Receive package in good condition,  product is smooth on your skin, weightless not greasy at all, has a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> COSMEDICA advertizes their products for women but they are so well prepared with care being given to skin types that they are equally effective for men. Or this very fine product Cosmedica combines 5% Vitamin C (for exfoliation and rejuvenation of underlying collagen) and adds Aloe, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, and Coenzyme Q10 to penetrate and nurture collagen while you sleep. Begin with a cleansing of the face and a toning of the skin (with Cosmedica products) and then apply this very soothing night cream before turning in for the evening. You&#x27;ll wake up with a fresher appearance and even note that those fine lines are disappearing. This is a great product from a very reliable and respected company (ye, they actually do have an unconditional return policy!). Grady Harp, December 14</li>
    <li> Excellent night cream.</li>
    <li> 1 week after using this cream every night. My skin does look better hydrated and more &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; - I would say &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; but it is because it just looks smoother.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cream. Works great and for the price. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Not sure. I cannot say I have seen a big difference&lt;br /&gt;It is absorbing quite well into the skin, the smell it is not so pleasant , over all I am not so convinced it is that great</li>
    <li> I received the product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dry skin gets even drier after my three-times-weekly swims.  I need a heavy-duty moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate between this product and Vitamin E cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very creamy and rich but not greasy.  Doesn&#x27;t look greasy, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ingredients -- hyaluronic acid, aloe, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is 2 oz, though the jar (which has an empty plastic filler around it) seems larger.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to get this to review my honest .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that you only need to use a small amount to achieve the effects.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not oily, nor heavy&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other moisturizers out there and HONESTLY I love this one ! I see this jar lasting me a while .</li>
    <li> Light, non-greasy, goes well under makeup too! No strong scent! Feels wonderful on skin, face is more radiant and youthful and does not cause irritation or skin breakouts. I highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product at discounted prince in return of my honest opinion and review.</li>
    <li> The product is a little on the greasy side, My opinion but it works very nicely. I choose to use only at night, along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. SWEET</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was a little skeptical when ordering because I am African American and some products just don&#x27;t work for my ginger skin but it has enhanced my skin.  I have noticed that my skin is more vibrant and youthful looking after using for about two weeks. My skin is also softer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!</li>
    <li> Cream is non-scented and smooths nicely on the skin.  Non-greasy feeling.  Those are important characteristics to me.</li>
    <li> Good!  not great!  feels a little waxy, a little thick.  Too soon to tell if it is working on wrinkles.</li>
    <li> While the consistency is thick and takes some times to rub into the skin, and the smell is one that is rather bland, this cream does a great job at sealing in the skin&#x27;s natural moisture as well as serum layer. I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in fine lines and suppleness of my skin in only 4 days!</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream on my face ever since It arrived and I have got to tell you that this feels so amazing on my face. The smooth texture to it makes it feel so gentle to your skin and I also can see some difference in my face such as there is less wrinkles from my face. Even my children can see that this cream has made me look more beautiful. I also have seen that my skin is not hardly dry anymore thanks to this cream. I would most definitely recommend this product my family members and friends. Actually, I already did, to my daughter and she loves it also. Thanks Cosmedica Skincare, for letting me get the chance to use this product.</li>
    <li> I rubbed some on my neck and it caused an allergy.</li>
    <li> I like the product and use it after cleansing and using a serum.</li>
    <li> So far this stuff has worked nicely. My skin has stayed nice and hydrated.</li>
    <li> This stuff I should amazing.though I am definitely glad I sampled for free I will be buying once the container is empty.you will feel and see a difference after one night and it just has gotten better for me day by day.If it keeps it up I will be a customer for life.I encourage anyone needing hydration to purchase</li>
    <li> While it did take a while to receive this cream, despite having a prime membership, I am happy that I waited. I can honestly say that this cream works well. I have been using this cream for about a week, in combination with my daily facial routine, and have noticed several positive results. First, my skin was starting to become dry. I had used a product prior to this that really did not work well for my skin and left my face dry and flaky. After the first use of this cream, I noticed that the dry skin was practically gone. After a week, my skin feels well hydrated and is starting to go back to the normal smooth, blemish free skin I usually have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I noticed was that my pores remain tight after using this cream. It doesn&#x27;t clog them or cause the skin on my nose to become oily like other moisturizers. My skin feels velvety and smooth. It&#x27;s not heavy, but rather silky and light. It really is a nice facial cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is that it doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant. It smells very herbal, kind of medicinal. However, it does contain many beneficial herbal ingredients which probably contribute to the smell. I guess it&#x27;s a small price to pay for the benefit of the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I really did like this product and will definitely continue using this.</li>
    <li> No words this hydrating night cream is amazing. So smooth and silky. My skin looks so renewed the&lt;br /&gt;Moment I put it on.  I received this wonderful product for my honey feedback and this one is a winner.  Don&#x27;t wait treat yourself.</li>
    <li> Excellent products, great price.</li>
    <li> Seems to be ok.  Not used it long enough to rate.</li>
    <li> I am always on a search for the perfect facial moisturizer as I am turning 35 this year and am trying to slow the aging process. Overall, I like this cream and it made my face nice and soft. I used this after washing my face both in the morning and evening because I wanted to try it at bed and under makeup. This felt lightweight and not overly greasy after it soaks in and my pores even seemed to look a littler better. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. I also have psoriasis and currently have a small patch on my cheek by my ear.  In the past, a few moisturizers have irritated and caused my psoriasis to burn a little or itch and I had no issues at all using this cream. This night cream was also fine under my makeup during the day.  I know this is a night cream but I had to see if I would be greasy all day but I was fine.&lt;br /&gt;  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this is a few of the ingredients.  Overall, I liked the oils they use as they do try to incorporate some natural ingredients which makes me happy.  I, however, did not like the use of alcohol in this cream.  Alcohol usually is what gives the lightweight feeling and the not so greasy feeling as it causes it to dry and therefore, leads to the light non-greasy feel and also helps the ingredients to absorb but does that at the cost of stripping your skin of natural oils. I received this at a discount to test and give my honest opinion.  Overall, I like the way my skin feels and looks and I like some of the oils they use.  I give them 4 stars because I like it, but not the use of alcohol in the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite moisturizers because it does not irritate my skin, it has awesome ingredients and it works ( It helps hydrate my skin for the next day and it keeps it dewy and tight. I wear it every day at night so my skin is hydrated and every morning under my makeup so it looks beautiful even after a few hours !!!</li>
    <li> Excellent, I love this cream.  Great moisturizer for my face &amp; skin type.  Very pleased.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging. I also like the fact that the product does not have a strange odor, especially since it is being applied to my face. But I do not like the fact that it is very thick. It takes a bit of work to rub into the skin and it leaves kind of a greasy look. I also do not like the fact that it makes your skin extra sensitive to the sun. Not good for people like me who are already easily sun burnt. I was given this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Light, non-greasy, goes well under makeup too!  No strong scent.  This is definitely a product that will be reordered again and again.</li>
    <li> not so great....but haven&#x27;t used it for that long...so we&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product, it is gentle and does what is claims.  I needed some night cream for hydration, great to use in the evening after total cleansing, unlike some products, my skin did not get greasy in the morning or all day long.</li>
    <li> I use this for a day cream and give me great skin for all day. Only give 4 stars because it has a slight fragrance and I prefer fragrance-free.</li>
    <li> I use this with the hyaluronic acid serum. I only need it once in the morning and my face glows all day. I actually use this as a primer and moisturizer under my makeup. I have received so many compliments on my skin. I was mistaken for 7 years younger my a classmate.</li>
    <li> great night cream...kinda thick but it&#x27;s not greasy or feels &#x27;heavy.&#x27;</li>
