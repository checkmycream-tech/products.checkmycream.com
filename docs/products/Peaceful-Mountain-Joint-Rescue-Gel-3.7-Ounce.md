    <li> I keep a tube of this in my tennis bag , and rub some on my \\&quot;sore knee\\&quot; after I play.  Its not greasy, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;reek\\&quot; and I think it helps!</li>
    <li> I used it multiple times a day for support</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who has some pain in her Achilles tendon after running track.  She used the tendon rescue and said it really works.  Pretty good recommendation!</li>
    <li> This homeopathic remedy does work.  It goes on cool and &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; into your skin with no greasy leftover gel.  The pain seems to diminish and mobility returns.  I have a spare tube now on hand because I do not want to run out.  I can&#x27;t take oral meds but I can get better relief, local relief, with this Peaceful Mountain Joint Rescue.  I&#x27;m a believer.</li>

    <li> I was very achy in one hip. After three weeks, the gel worked great. I get occasional twinge, use the gel, and it eases up in about 10 minutes. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> The best pain relief we have found yet! Love it! no smell, no grease, and most importantly, it works fantastic! Even my stubborn sister admitted it helps her pain in her legs.</li>
    <li> A friend suggested I use this product, so I tried it, but for me it did not do anything. I cannot tell the difference. My joints still hurt whether I use it or not.</li>
    <li> Did not feel much results yet maybe it takes many days!</li>
    <li> This stuff is an excellent natural rub for achy joints. I use it because I am an illustrator and work 10-15 days drawing. Learned about it while working at WholeFoods. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for a couple years now for very painful knees and arthritis. This product gives him relief from the pain. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years. I have arthritic knees and find that this particular product gives me relief from the pain that can become debilitating at times.</li>
    <li> This gel did not help my joint pain</li>
    <li> I discovered this gel for a strained shoulder, pleased enough to gift one to my dad.  Not surprisingly, it really helped with his &amp;#34;ouchy&amp;#34; knees.</li>
    <li> I have 2 bad knees and was very skeptical about even trying this product.  None of the hot, icy, or other products have done a thing.  Since I liked this brand of back and neck rescue, I tried a bottle....then another &amp; another &amp; another.  I am amazed this product works.  There is virtually no smell so you don&#x27;t feel like a nursing home, it dries quickly and there is no oily residue, and it isn&#x27;t chock full of chemicals that I can&#x27;t pronounce.  It&#x27;s worth the Washingtons.</li>
    <li> Works great for sore joints. My husband has both Osgood–Schlatter disease in one knee and cubital tunnel syndrome in both elbows. This gel seems to help reduce swelling and inflammation, as well as soreness and pain. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> The product that I purchased is in a clear tube with dark brown lid but I&#x27;m assuming it is the same stuff.  I have used it on sore joints for years.  I am currently using it in combination with other treatments but it seems to be helpful.  I like that it does not contain any toxic ingredients and does not irritate my skin. My acupuncturist used his magic method to test this against Peaceful Mountain Arnica Plus and said the Joint Rescue would work better for me.</li>
