<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the smell of this product!  Its a light, pleasant natural scent.  No chemical fragrance here!  Leaves your hair soft and light, does not weight it down, I have fine blonde hair so this is a common problem for me with other hair oils.  I add a small amount to my palms and work throughout the ends of my hair when its wet and/or dry.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this Macadamia Oil. For fine hair it seems to work much better than any Argan Oil product. Never weighs hair down. It makes my hair soft &amp; manageable &amp; gives a much better curl.</li>
    <li> I think it is a counterfeit. I bought the original macadamia oil from a salon before and it was amazing, this one is totally plain and dull.  It tangles my hair and feel sticky and makes dirt attach to my hair. It doesnt give the silky feeling the original one gives and it doesnt have that herbal feeling that the original ones have.</li>
    <li> I used my sis n laws when she was at my house and loved it.  I searched online for the best price for the product and found it here.  Will definitely order from them again!</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  This is the second one I have ordered online.  I could just as well buy it at my beauty store, but not for this price.  And since, I&#x27;m mostly home bound, this makes it much easier to buy online!  This makes my hair more managable and less dry and also since I live in a high humidity area, it calms the frizzies!</li>
    <li> The bottles were packaged great, thank goodness because the shipping box was opened at one end. I&#x27;m  surprised the bottles didn&#x27;t fall out. Just thought you should know this. Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> Great oil but smells too manly!</li>
    <li> Love love love this oil! Way better than Argan oil - not greasy at all</li>
    <li> Good product.  I just put a drop of it in my palm and rub it into my hair.  My hair was sun damaged and felt SO much better after a week or two.  My hairstylist noticed the difference as well.</li>
    <li> Use this product all the time, can&#x27;t believe the shine &amp; manageably I have with it.</li>
    <li> Not only does this smell great, but it works great too! The smell is kinda hippy-ish &#x3D; patchouli. I have thin wavy hair that can be dry and then oily and stringy. I get static and fly-aways right after I blow dry and frizzy if I left air dry. This stuff helps takes care of the static, frizz and dryness. It also adds shine. I have to use another product to add volume. I use this on damp and dry hair. Not heavy and absorbs well.</li>
    <li> It is good but  too trick for my hair ..</li>
    <li> The order came on time. I really liked the product. There is only one concern that why the bottle wasn&#x27;t filled up. Oil was about three fourth of the bottle.</li>
    <li> grate for sine in your hair and helps split ends</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! Makes my hair beautiful! Helps my hair keep calm. worth the price on here!</li>
    <li> I can sum this up into one word... AWESOME !  The fragrance, texture,  shine,  all awesome.&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this 10 stars I would.</li>
    <li> I do love it. It do improve my dry hair. And the smell is so good.I recommend.</li>
    <li> I love it. My hair really looked and felt better. I like it better than the mask. I just wish I didn&#x27;t run out so quick...</li>
    <li> Should only need a small amount. Works great and best at the ends of your hair. Even better with the oil infused comb.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! I have very thick hair with lots of frizz!! This makes my hair lay down and stay smooth all day!! The smell is AMAZING!!! The price is good here too!!</li>
    <li> I flat iron my hair, which can leave the ends a bit dry.  I use Macadamia Oil every day -- and it keeps my hair in great shape.  It smells good too!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy</li>
    <li> This oil is very good!  I have tried numerous oils and most of them I like, but this one is special.  I can apply it every night to the ends of my hair and my hair does not look or feel greasy in the morning.  This is very important as I do not wash my hair every day yet I want it to be hydrated but not oily and greasy looking on the second day.  I plan to continue to use this oil as it smells very nice and does a good job of moisturizing the ends of my hair.  It also helps with the frizzies.</li>
    <li> Product packaging not professional and bottom was only half full. I have used this product for years and I don&#x27;t believe this is the same as I have been purchasing. It smells different and does not work the same</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product by my hair dresser and loved it from the very first use! I live in Florida and humidity can be a nightmare. I also have curly hair. This product keeps my hair friz free.</li>
    <li> This works really well with my thick frizzy hair...the smell tho!! I was so excited to get this and I&#x27;m 98% sure I won&#x27;t repurchase based on the sad fact that it stinks so bad. Ick! If it were my only option, sure why not..but there&#x27;s about 2 million variations out there that happen to smell delightful ;)</li>
    <li> My husband has to have this product, it makes his hair so shiny and soft, and not oily.  You can rub it on your skin to....The smell is clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Great oil for the hair!</li>
    <li> Daily application needed..if not my hair looks very dry.</li>
    <li> Excellent and delivery was faster than promised...very happy with service and product</li>
    <li> Like others, I bought this on another site for double the price and wanted more. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for this price!</li>
    <li> This oil has a wonderful fragrance, feels great, and does the job of defining the waves/curl in my hair.  Been using it for years</li>
    <li> Favorite hair treatment product. I initially received a sample via my Ipsy subscription. I purchased a full size on Amazon for a reasonable price. Will not likely buy again, as it&#x27;s pretty pricey, and there are many alternative products that have the same effect at a lesser cost (see Argan Oil products).</li>
    <li> This stuff leaves my hair sooooo soft and silky., it&#x27;s better than most products I have tried. I love the smell and feel of the product, I have fairly thin hair so if you are like me then make sure you use a small amount only or else your hair will look greasy and dirty!</li>
    <li> This is a great oil for hair and scalp. I have been using for a week now and I Love it!</li>
    <li> This oil makes my and my daughters hair feel great!</li>
    <li> I bought this because one of my friends recommended it, but after using it I&#x27;m not really sure if it did anything or not. My hair felt pretty much the same.</li>
    <li> This oil smells amazing and when used sparingly, makes your hair soooo soft when you blow dry.  I love this whole line.</li>
    <li> Since I have to do a texture treatment and the keratin treatment, I must use a hair product that has disodium laureth sulfosuccinate. Which is quit hard to find... Thankfully I found this product and it works great for my treated hair.(shampoo/conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil works amazing for my hair and it protect me from the flat iron. I use it every day since my hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have used several oils in the past, I gone to beauty salons and used what they recommended and in the end it just felt oily and gross. But when I found this product I fell in love with it. It definitely keeps me hair looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I recommended to anyone that has dried, fizzy, damaged hair, as well as, to those who have had their hair treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside the bottle is small and if you use it as much as I do, around every 2-3 weeks you will need to buy another bottle. From all the Macadamia hair product, I think this is the most expensive one but its one I need the most.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell but definitely did not do any thing for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had to mix it with some other product.</li>
    <li> this is wonderful, different than MoroccanOil which initially softens hair and makes it shiny but then begins to make it limp ... this just doesn&#x27;t feel oily on my hair, I have long hair and use one squirt ... the fragrance is strong for about two minutes and then fades to nothing ... love this product, prefer it to the Macadamia Oil Masque</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and it makes my hair feel good and exceptional healthy....It is a light product</li>
    <li> I use this daily, I have dry hair that is colored my salon has it.  Can&#x27;t live without this product!!!  Sandy Simacek</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Macadamia Oil for years now and this is the best price I have been able to find it. It is a great product that will make your hair look amazing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I had been hospitalized about a year ago and was pretty sick and had significant hair loss because of the toll it took on my body. I have hair down to my mid back and then I have a layer of about 6 in long hair which is all new growth from what fell out. This oil helps smooth everything down and keeps those frizzy 6 in hair less noticeable. And it does not give my hair a greasy look!</li>
    <li> Do not be fooled by this product. It is not the original formula. Someone here is cheating customers by using this packaging and a different oil inside. Very, very disappointed. I have used the $40 bottle that looks identical to this and the oil inside is completely different!</li>
    <li> This oil is somewhat addictive haha its soooo smooth and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair too greasy. it smells good also. this is an awesome product</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the frizzies, but it certainly does help.  It smells amazing and a little bit goes long way.  I prefer it on damp hair, as I tried it on dry hair and it just looked greasy.</li>
    <li> Double the price at Ulta!!  I&#x27;m so happy I f found this. No shipping and better price. What&#x27;s not to love! I can&#x27;t do my hair without this product. I have naturally wavy hair with some frizz. This product makes it smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> The smell of this hair care product is foul! I threw mine out!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I use this oil along with the Macadamia Flawless shampoo and my hair has never been softer and shinier!  You only need a super small amount of this oil so it seems like the bottle will last a long time.  Smells great (for men or women).</li>
    <li> This oil is very good for my hair, and it smells good. Makes my hair soft, and manageable, and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gggreen</li>
    <li> Love this product. It smells great and leaves your hair feeling soft and healthy. I also like it so much more than Moroccan Oil, which I find leaves my hair feeling oily - this does not! It seems like a no-brainer to me</li>
    <li> best hair oil there is outhere. i have been using this before so i am very pleased. The only small inconvenient is that when i got it, it dripped in the package, no too much so it is still good to use and the price is very good. Love ittt!!</li>
    <li> excellent product !! recommendable sellers.</li>
    <li> This is working great on my dry hair -- is now softer, less damaged looking.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite hair oil. Amazing smell. Amazing benefits. Can&#x27;t you tell I love, love this product. My hair loves it, too</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff --and this is coming from someone with serious hair dry/damage issues! I have fine hair and other oils I&#x27;ve tried have been too greasy, and/or not effective. Bought this at CVS but will re-purchase here as from now on I will not be able to live without it! I couldn&#x27;t believe how much softer and smoother my hair was after just one use. Had read that it&#x27;s good to rub btwn your palms before applying as it heats the oil a bit. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I read about this product on a Yahoo article.  Being one who will try anything that promises to make my thick, naturally coarse hair soft, I purchased this.  Absolutely LOVE it!!  This will definitely make your hair soft and strong.</li>
    <li> it is a miracle in a jar!!! it made my hair silky! shiny! one drop is enough dont use alot or ur hair will be greasy&lt;br /&gt;i am about to buy the full set</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found another 5-star hair product and this is it!  After reading a number of very positive reviews of this product, I ordered it myself.  All you need is a very small amount in which to rub in your hair...I applied it to wet hair following shampooing and conditioning.  I do have a favorite Argan Oil hair product that I currently use, but this one surpasses that one!  It leaves my hair feeling healthy, bouncy and full, shiny and easy-to-manage.  The scent is pleasant and not too laden with perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using other products in this line.  Meanwhile, I will be using this every time I wash my hair and even in between.  A keeper!</li>
    <li> It was too thick and nade my hair greasy. Threw away and bought argan oil instead</li>
    <li> I apply this oil after i have styled with heat... It polishes, smooths and adds bounce! I only use about nickle size portion, and it does great in my thick shoulder length hair. The bottle lasts and the price is much better than any store! I will not do without this product!</li>
    <li> I went to a salon to have my hair cut and colored and the stylist used this product on my stressed hair.  It has this beautiful scent, that calmed me and my hair.  I will forever get this product.  Its healing powers did a lot for my hair.  And my mind.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. So much more expensive to buy at a store.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this oil, it feels so good on my hair but it gave me bad breakout on my neck and jawlines where my hair touches. Too bad!</li>
    <li> This helps my wavy, curly hair stay frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the .34oz bottle to test it out.  I went through that bottle in 4 months.  So I got this bottle.  This should last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing, but I noticed the .34oz bottle smelled better. Weird, loses a star for that.</li>
    <li> I did not like it at all. Rite Aid has this oil, and I got the small one to try. The smell and even the texture of that was different.</li>
    <li> i love it! i have black hair and with this product my hair not only does it smell good but  hair is always shiny and silky i would recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> Love this product for shine and conditioning.  Have used it for years and will continue to do so.  The price is outstanding.  I refuse to pay double the price as seen in grocery store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 yrs now, but previously bought it at the salon I go to - for over $40 a bottle. I saw that there were mixed reviews, some claiming that this item is not the real deal...&lt;br /&gt;I found that the product I received is definitely the real deal. My order came from amazon seller Quick E Deal.It&#x27;s the right color, the right smell, the right consistency and effect. So if it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck, smells like a duck...&lt;br /&gt;As far as the effects of this oil - it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that really nourishes and tames my porous, naturally curly hair.  I don&#x27;t usually blow my hair dry but when I need to, this seems to protect it from the heat and warm air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re still hesitant to try it, you could go with the very small bottle, which still last quite a while. I did this first time and saved the bottle afterwards to fill for travelling!</li>
    <li> Love this product for curly hair. So much cheaper than in the store.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Great pretreatment before blow drying.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I used to buy it from a salon before and spend $30 on this little bottle. I use it in the shower before I wash my hair. I just let it soak in for about 5 minutes. I found using it after the shower made my hair look greasy. But my hair is really soft now that I use it in the shower and does not look greasy.</li>
    <li> No more frizzy hair or greasy hair with products. Macadamia oil help my hair easy to style but not greasy. Love it so much!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Will order again</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this oil in a Birchbox box and really liked it.  So did my daughter so I gave her the sample bottle and got myself a full-size one.  It feels good on my hair.  Can&#x27;t feel anything on it but the frizz and static is mostly gone, even in the dead of winter (like now).  Also great is the fact that after you spread a small amt through your hair you don&#x27;t feel the need to wash your hands. It is a good skin oil, too, so just massage it into the backs of your hands.  Smell is light and pleasant, too.  Win-win.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Pure oil unlike watery diluted oil found in stores like Rite Aid and CVS.</li>
    <li> Met all my expectstions</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, it not only tames my hair it&#x27;s nourishing at the same time. I really love this product. On Amazon its this product is more affordable then going to the store.</li>
    <li> Love the product, great price!</li>
    <li> Love it kept hair moist, growing</li>
    <li> I love it!! Very good product~</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot to say about this...it&#x27;s o.k. Doesnt seem to be a miracle oil...I have a hair oil by Suave, which I use more often. Mostly because of the horrible packaging of this item. The pump has never worked! So I have to unscrew it to get any oil. Again, I don&#x27;t feel as if it provides any kind of miraculous results that I couldn&#x27;t get with a more inexpensive item.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smells so good and leaves my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve used, EVER! This product helps keep my hair frizz-free w/out making it look greasy. I towel-dry my hair, put about about a dime-size amount in my hands, rub hands together, then apply over the most frizzy portions of my hair. It really does work!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Great smell and is so lightweight on my thick hair. The only thing is, I believe that my bottle was previously used. I put it up to the light and there was a lot of space left at the top that was not supposed to be there.</li>
    <li> I do not believe that this is the product sold at hair salons. Looks like it, but is not the same quality, it is an ok product but not as good.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot!!!! It smells fantastic and is really comparable to the more expensive argon and Moroccan oil. it smooths my wavy frizzy hair nicely</li>
    <li> Love this product! Leaves my hair really soft &amp; shinny. I&#x27;m not really a fan of the smell but this makes my hair feel great (:</li>
    <li> With a few drops smeared on my hands then gently rubbed into my wet, damp or dry hair, this Macadamia Oil, Natural Oil Healing Oil Treatment tames the frizz and leaves my hair soft and shinny. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I did like this product. I use to have a dry hair and since I use the product, my hair became more live and silky and even my husband commented on my hair and how it changed.</li>
    <li> I has been used macadamia oil natural. 2yrs now it&#x27;s a great oil. It keep my hair  so smooth. Shinny n healthy look. I just put a little bit on my hair before I go to wrk. it last all day smelling so good!!! I love it.</li>
    <li> Simple purchase. Great price. Great delivery time. I LOVE this product...it works wonders on my hair. No more split ends, soft and shiny. Thanks!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, is helping to heal my damage, dry hair. It does not leave my hair grease but hydrated, give this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years.  I used it before I blow dry my hair and rub some in my hair before I leave for work.  Makes my hair shine.  You only need a small amount. It also makes my face feel smooth.</li>
    <li> this is the first oil treatment I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair and actually makes a difference. Frizzies and dryness are much improved.</li>
    <li> The oil smells wonderful, does not weigh my hair down and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> i enjoyed this product worked as advertised</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is thick, long, colour treated and Keratin and this product brings life back to my hair. Actually the entire line is great!</li>
    <li> I use it on my face, skin and hair... hydrating especially through the cold weather! Small amount goes a long ways!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT SMELLS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL SCENT ITS SUPPOSED TO HAVE. I TRUELY DONT BELIEVE ITS AN ORIGINAL I&#x27;D RATHER SPEND A FEW BUCKS EXTRA AND GET THE ORIGINAL. IM UPSET THAT ON TOP OF IT NOT BEING WHAT I EXPECTED I HAVE TO PAY FOR SHIPPING TO RETURN IT. NEVER AGAIN</li>
    <li> I used to use Moroccan oil and it was too greasy. This doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like that at all.</li>
    <li> This is miracle food for your hair! I love it and use it ever day and it makes my hair stay in great shape. And I process my hair by lighting it blond with foils every 9 wks or so! I also just started to use their shampoo and conditioner with great effects and I love their leave in conditioner and their hairspray too! and they have a much better deal on it here than in the stores!</li>
    <li> I bought the full line of this product and have only used it twice.  Each time the results were spectacular!  Even my shampoo girl and hair stylist loved the way it made my hair smell, look and feel.  The shampoo girl just couldn&#x27;t stop feeling my hair and smelling the products as she applied them.  I don&#x27;t have a relaxer and haven&#x27;d had one in at least 16 years.  My hair is very thick and course.  When water hits my hair it turns into a curly, nappy mess.  Macadamia to the rescue....it makes my hair so much more manageable.  I don&#x27;t have to work as hard when doing my own hair anymore.  The end result is health, silky smooth manageable hair without all of the chemicals.  For the best results, I strongly recommend buying the shampoo, conditioning rinse (conditioner), repair mask, leave in conditioner, and oil.  If you&#x27;re skeptical, just buy the sample pack to try it first.  That&#x27;s what I did then after the first use, I purchased the 33 oz bottles of everything!  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt so good,  Just a dab after I&#x27;ve washed my hair, and it has never felt so good.  The color stays longer, and the condition improves with every application!</li>
    <li> Perfect for any hair!! Your hair will feel fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regenerates Damaged Hair Cells With Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure. Argan oil may prevent this damage and protect our hair against aggressive factors, maintaining it healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is an excellent rescue for hair that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Macadamia Oil smells amazing!  Love this stuff</li>
    <li> Just love using this workout video.  I can work out in my house and enjoy it all at the same time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, use it every where, not just the scalp, absorbs, non greasy, great scent, hubby likes it too..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this is the same as the original one sold at beauty stores. The scent seems a bit off. I also haven&#x27;t noticed that it makes my hair any smoother than the regular drugstore brands. I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing again. I think there are better oils out there.</li>
    <li> I can never go back to using any other oil products for my hair.  This works wonders.  I&#x27;ve bought it three times already for the past three years and I still remember the first time I used this.  I got a sample pack from the new beauty test tube monthly subscription.  I didn&#x27;t think anything of it at first  and I only used it the first time because I didn&#x27;t have any other hair product to moisturizer my dry hair.  So I opened this up, used it, and have been a fan since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the hair dryer that often.  I usually just towel dry my hair, apply a small amount of the oil through, and combed it in.  It dries my hair fast and keeps my hair from becoming frizzy.  My hair is naturally straight but tends to dry and get all matted because it&#x27;s long.  It does do that when I use the oil. It also works great when you blow dry your hair after applying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite products from the macadamia oil line is this healing oil and the hair repair mask.  They work wonders.  Not too fond of the shampoo and conditioner.  They were blech.</li>
    <li> amazing product really helps make my hair smooth and healthy</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this oil. I use it every time I get out if the shower. and again after I straighten my hair. it smells amazing, not fruity like most hair products. it&#x27;s more musky smell. it&#x27;s wonderful. it makes my hair so smooth and soft, and it dries faster after applying this to damp hair. this us a great price considering it&#x27;s double this amount from other retailers!</li>
    <li> I bought a small size at my local Ulta a month or so ago and loved the product. I wanted to buy a full size, but it was 40$ at the store and I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much. I searched on here and found it for less than half. I ordered it and it was estimated to be delivered to me within a week and a half. It came in less than a week. The product itself is an oil I use on the ends of my hair, and I sometimes mix it with my conditioner when I wash my hair. It has a light smell and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it look greasy. (Just don&#x27;t put it on my roots, or it will look greasy.) I would reccomend it, especially at the price it is!</li>
    <li> I have beached my pixie cut hair and use this when my hair is still damp as styling hold. It is thicker than most other oils I have tried and does help in styling. I use maybe a dimes worth on my hands, rub them together then into my hair using a &amp;#34;claw game&amp;#34; technique to finish. it adds soft hold, absorbs in and keeps my hair so smooth and touchable. For extra hold I add the same amount of Aveda hold paste using the same technique. But most days just the oil is enough. Before this oil my hair was like straw and hard to soften up. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Incredible product!, since I&#x27;ve been using it my hair is so soft and healthy! I highly recommend this product to everybody.</li>
    <li> I have used this only once on my hair but I am HOOKED!!! My step mom got a tiny sample of it from her hair dresser and she said she absoutely loved it, so I figured I would give it a try. I have argan oil on my hair for the past probably 3 or 4 years and I love it, however, I am someone who likes to switch up hair products because I get bored. Boy am I glad I tried this! I put about a nickel side amount of the product in my damp hair and just let it air dry. First off, it smells AMAZING!!!! I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell, just really yummy! Second, it made my hair ridiculously soft and shiny, even without blow drying it! I would highly recommend buying this product!&lt;br /&gt;Side note: i have read a lot of reviews on Amazon on this whole line (the Macadamia Natural Oil line) and the majority of people who have first purchased the product in a salon and then bought it on here said the product was a fake. If i were you, I would recommend buying it in store and spend the extra money just to ensure you get the original, authentic product.</li>
    <li> Like it. Works well and I think the entire product line smells great. Might be too heavy if you use a deep conditioner in conjunction. Wet look if you overdo it.</li>
    <li> It is a great product, my hair is perfect, whether I use, plain or iron looks great</li>
    <li> excellent product really help my hair</li>
    <li> This is my must have hair product. It smells amazing and makes your hair super shiny. it makes your hair not only look and feel healthy but actually has a lasting affect on your hair. It has helped me keep my hair very healthy and beautiful while I grow it out.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair oils I have ever tried.  I always make sure there is a spare bottle or two around the house.</li>
    <li> only thing in the last 25 years that has worked for me!</li>
    <li> Read so many good reviews on this product which made me want to try it. As a stylist I expected More from the product smells wonderful cute bottle very Rich in lather but unfortunately I&#x27;ve found better product at a cheaper rate..</li>
    <li> the smell is great and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works well with flatiron, doesn&#x27;the leave greasy feeling. Much better price than salon where stylist used &amp; recommended the product</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have been using for years now on my curly hair.  The problem was that I was not sent the product pictured, but rather a lighter spray version.  I had ordered one bottle for myself and another for a friend.  They both came wrapped in bubble wrap.  I gave her hers without unwrapping the bubble wrap.  It was not until I unwrapped my own bottle that I saw the mistake.  By then, she had used hers and it was too late to return.  I took mine to a local beauty supply and paid an additional $10 to exchange the item.  Not a great experience.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil to use w/ my recent purchase of the Macadamia Hair mask. Since I was told if used together the result would be amazing. And that, I can say was 100% accurate. I used both treatments together and the final results left my hair incredibly soft, lustrous shiny and bouncy. My hair looks/ feel healthy/amazing and the compliments on my hair are endless. Recommend 100%. And the company that shipped it did a great job with replacing first ordered that came in mail broken. They replaced item w/ new order and I received it immediately.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does a great job on my natural hair. In a couple of weeks I will need to order some more.</li>
    <li> This product does make my hair shiny but the scent is not something I would want on my hair if I were going somewhere dressed up.</li>
    <li> My daughter is a hairdresser and was super happy to have found this, obliviously a good product!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this anywhere else. At least not this huge a bottle. Ecstatic when i saw it was sold online at this price albeit! It&#x27;s expensive where i come from. Keeps my hair smooth especially since i love bleaching and dying my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, but I hated the oil. I received a sample and thought I liked it, but for some reason, the smell became more and more unpleasant over time. Maybe because I used the sample for a couple days before ordering, I didn&#x27;t get the full effect. This weighed down my fine hair and would look wet with even a small amount. It&#x27;s a hit or miss with pricier brands, but this wasn&#x27;t a hit for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The scent is wonderful and it really helps decrease the fizziness and dryness of my very coarse dry hair. After I shampoo I apply this with the leave in conditioner and my hair feels soft and silky. Love this line.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff! I have very fine hair and this is lightweight yet conditions perfect without weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> Every product I have ever tried for my hair does not compare to this! I have naturally curly/wavy hair that I blow dry &amp; flat iron straight. I also color on a regular basis &amp; we have hard water. This oil helps heal &amp; seal my hair to strengthen it &amp; helps it grow. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> great product my hair is healthier and shiny.</li>
    <li> Smells devine and so smooth on the hair. Not too oily!!</li>
    <li> i use this product after taking my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on a semi wet hair, i take 1-2 pumps on my hand and apply all over the hair (make sure not reach the hair roots and scalp to avoide greasy look hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and i tie my hair and leve to dry normally&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s amaizing i will keep using it ! now i purchased a 300ML bottle LOOOOL</li>
    <li> WOW!! I&#x27;ve heard people rave about this product for what seems like centuries and now I can see why. It is a miracle worker! It makes my hair shiny, soft, have less split ends, and much more!! It also smells so great! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
