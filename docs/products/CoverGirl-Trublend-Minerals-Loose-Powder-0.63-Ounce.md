### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Best drugstore powder!</li>
      <li>The Powder is wonderful.</li>
      <li>But it works great on my face</li>
      <li>Great cover.</li>
      <li>gives that nice glow both in and out of the sun!</li>
      <li>Good product, not so shimmery..</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for almost a year and find it really good.</li>
      <li>This is not the seller&#x27;s fault but buyers should know that if they truly want \\&quot;light\\&quot; they need to purchase the fair shade instead.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite foundation EVER!</li>
      <li>Better to use in the summer!</li>
      <li>It works just as well and flawlessly as its top competitors, and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I had to wash my face completely after putting it on my perfect looking make up.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a powder that has done that, great for when yore losing your summer tan;)</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>If you are going out for the night or are going to be out for an extended period of time without being able to touch-up here and there, I&#x27;d suggest going with another powder.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this powder - nice light coverage.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t look caked on when I use it, and it actually has very good coverage by itself.</li>
      <li>The shipping was extremely fast, which is very good, thank you so much.</li>
      <li>Feels light on my skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of 1 because it does feel light when it is on.</li>
      <li>I was a bit hesitant in choosing a color and with the help of covergirl.com&#x27;s color match, I decided on the Translucent Light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kinda light skinned</li>
      <li>The powder said light</li>
      <li>I have olive toned skin and got the Light version of the translucent powder.  </li>
      <li>Started using this when Cornsilk was no longer available.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a light color &amp; matches my skin tone</li>
      <li>Either way, it really does blend in super effectively with your skin tone.</li>
      <li>I would suggest this powder to someone that wants a full coverage powder that is able to touch-up their makeup every couple hours.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more like a bronzing powder, gives a very sparkly look.</li>
      <li>very pleased overall!!</li>
      <li>It was just the right color for me, and will work well as I continue developing my sun tan.</li>
      <li>Feels very cheap in general, which it is, so next time I will just save my money and get a better quality mineral makeup.</li>
      <li>CoverGirl Trublend Minerals Loose Powder is an amazing beauty product.</li>
      <li>First, the packaging says nothing about this being shimmery.  </li>
      <li>Actually like Trublend minerals better.</li>
      <li>I love it and will definitely continue to purchase it.</li>
      <li>I dont need any other kind of foundations or anything with it.</li>
      <li>Just as good as the more expensive stuff.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have many blemishes or you just have some minor skin discoloration, this powder will cover it by itself and you can skip the foundation.</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>It evens skin tone and covers blemishes and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>I was really just looking for a translucent finishing powder.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other powders that last for 4+ hours and keep my face looking nice and matte.</li>
      <li>I ordered light and was sent medium, which is too dark for my skin.  </li>
      <li>But I got this translucent light because I didn&#x27;t want something that was too dark.</li>
      <li>Sadly, it came in a not so good condition.</li>
      <li>I actually really like CoverGirl TruBlend Minerals Loose Powder, and I&#x27;ve had a love/hate relationship with it for years.</li>
      <li>(I have a dry and sensitive skin).</li>
      <li>Gives a natural glow and feels light on my skin...have been using it everyday for a few years now and never had a breakout!...</li>

<li> That is not what you want from your loose powder..</li>
<li> This makeup is not very dense at all.</li>
<li> So like other people said, yes, it did give my skin an even color.</li>

<li> Hard to review something I can&#x27;t use.</li>
<li> The color is darker than I expected, making is useless for me.</li>
<li> It is soo sparkly and makes you look extremely tanned, like a fake tan.</li>
<li> When I opened the box I was a bit worried that it would be too dark, but I was absolutely wrong!</li>
<li> Also it has weird shimmery sparkles in it.</li>
<li> It makes me look like I have a really bad orange fake</li>
<li> Too bad that color looks like a really bad fake tan.</li>
<li> So disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> This is way too pigmented and the color is horrible.  </li>
<li> Horrible look.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered light and was sent medium, which is too dark for my skin.  Hard to review something I can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> CoverGirl Trublend Minerals Loose Powder is an amazing beauty product. I cannot believe that it&#x27;s under ten dollars too! It works just as well and flawlessly as its top competitors, and I highly recommend it. I was a bit hesitant in choosing a color and with the help of covergirl.com&#x27;s color match, I decided on the Translucent Light. When I opened the box I was a bit worried that it would be too dark, but I was absolutely wrong! It was just the right color for me, and will work well as I continue developing my sun tan. Either way, it really does blend in super effectively with your skin tone. I love it and will definitely continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> That is not what you want from your loose powder.. its just sitting somewhere lost in my make up drawers. It is soo sparkly and makes you look extremely tanned, like a fake tan. Horrible look. I had to wash my face completely after putting it on my perfect looking make up.</li>
    <li> Best drugstore powder!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite foundation EVER! I dont need any other kind of foundations or anything with it. It also makes your skin an even color with I&#x27;ve never had a powder that has done that, great for when yore losing your summer tan;) Also, got mine a day before the date they gave me on when I ordered it. very pleased overall!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have pale skin, it&#x27;s slightly tan. But I got this translucent light because I didn&#x27;t want something that was too dark. So like other people said, yes, it did give my skin an even color. Too bad that color looks like a really bad fake tan. And this was with the second lightest one they have! It&#x27;s terrible. And since it&#x27;s used, I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> This is not the seller&#x27;s fault but buyers should know that if they truly want \\&quot;light\\&quot; they need to purchase the fair shade instead.  Aside from being quite heavy, I like the coverage.</li>
    <li> The shipping was extremely fast, which is very good, thank you so much. The powder said light but it&#x27;s more like a bronzing powder, gives a very sparkly look. Better to use in the summer!</li>
    <li> I love this powder - nice light coverage. I have trouble finding in stores.</li>
    <li> Great cover. Feels light on my skin. Started using this when Cornsilk was no longer available.  Actually like Trublend minerals better.</li>
    <li> I ordered this powder to wear on days when I didn&#x27;t want to wear foundation but still wanted some coverage. It works really well, it&#x27;s a light color &amp; matches my skin tone well. I&#x27;m kinda light skinned so I try to stick to lighter colors. It does have some sparkle to it, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting but it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly sparkly, just a little.</li>
    <li> This makeup is not very dense at all. I may as well not even bother putting any on because it seems like you have to cake it on to notice any difference. Also it has weird shimmery sparkles in it. Feels very cheap in general, which it is, so next time I will just save my money and get a better quality mineral makeup.</li>
    <li> I actually really like CoverGirl TruBlend Minerals Loose Powder, and I&#x27;ve had a love/hate relationship with it for years. I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t look caked on when I use it, and it actually has very good coverage by itself. If you don&#x27;t have many blemishes or you just have some minor skin discoloration, this powder will cover it by itself and you can skip the foundation. The thing I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I find that when I use this powder, I&#x27;ll have to reapply/touch-up every hour or two. I&#x27;ve used other powders that last for 4+ hours and keep my face looking nice and matte. I would suggest this powder to someone that wants a full coverage powder that is able to touch-up their makeup every couple hours. If you are going out for the night or are going to be out for an extended period of time without being able to touch-up here and there, I&#x27;d suggest going with another powder.</li>
    <li> Good product, not so shimmery..but it&#x27;s still there. Sadly, it came in a not so good condition. It literally spills. But it works great on my face (I have a dry and sensitive skin).</li>
    <li> So disappointed with this product.  First, the packaging says nothing about this being shimmery.  There&#x27;s tons of glitter in this. I was really just looking for a translucent finishing powder. This is way too pigmented and the color is horrible.  I have olive toned skin and got the Light version of the translucent powder.  It makes me look like I have a really bad orange fake tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of 1 because it does feel light when it is on.</li>
    <li> The Powder is wonderful. I have been using this product for almost a year and find it really good. Works just like i needed.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It evens skin tone and covers blemishes and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Just as good as the more expensive stuff.</li>
    <li> The color is darker than I expected, making is useless for me.</li>
    <li> Gives a natural glow and feels light on my skin...have been using it everyday for a few years now and never had a breakout!...gives that nice glow both in and out of the sun!</li>
