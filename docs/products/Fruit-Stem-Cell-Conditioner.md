      <li>excellent, well pleased, no complaints</li>
      <li>Smells great, refreshing!</li>
      <li>Good, high-quality conditioner with good results.</li>
      <li>Couple with or without the matching shampoo, I’m happy with it and recommend it to anyone looking for a thickening shampoo for fine and/or thinning hair while doing good things for the environment, animals and oneself.</li>
      <li>This is really nice.  </li>
      <li>Nice body.  </li>
      <li>Love this conditioner, love this brand!</li>
      <li>It smells really nice and makes my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist always compliments me on the healthy condition of my hair every time I go in for a hair cut.  </li>
      <li>I also tried using more of this conditioner -</li>
      <li>Great price and leaves my hair soft and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great, natural product.</li>
      <li>The conditioner rinsed out easily, leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has a bit of a strong smell, but nothing pungent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Neutral: Both this conditioner and its shampoo had a strong scent that reminded me of patchouli even though it does not contain any (perhaps it was the cedarwood and/or cloves?).</li>
      <li>Luckily the Full Volume Shampoo is so nice that I no longer have to use conditioner.</li>
      <li>I do not know if this product has really helped me grow or thicken my hair, but I am very pleased with the conditioning it gives.  </li>
      <li>good for me ingredients, and very important, actually works!</li>
      <li>&quot; If you like earthy scents, you might enjoy this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>:) I use as leave in after shower and as dries leaves my hair soft and very smooth</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, my hair has not been this soft, shiny and full of body in 20 years.</li>
      <li>I tried this product that I originally ordered from another large health food website (which has a lower price), but on that site I would have to purchase $49 to receive free shipping, and their shipping was not always the quickest.  </li>
      <li>I ended uo loving this conditioner more than I expected!</li>
      <li>Smells amazing, not to heavy, feels like it rinses off nice and clean, leaves hair soft and tangle free</li>
      <li>This conditioner smells heavenly if you love the scent of natural oils, which I do.  </li>
      <li>I have thrown out many bottles of natural and organic conditioners because my hair felt like straw after using their conditioners.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle on thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>: I like Andalou Naturals products as they tend to get low hazard scores from the EWG database (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep) by using safe ingredients.</li>
      <li>It leaves hair soft, smooth, lustrous and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I have added this product to my subscribe and save to save a little more money, but to know I also do not have to spend $49 to have this shipped free.</li>
      <li>and I do seem to be losing less hair, however the main reason I gave it 5 stars is because I have had extremely itchy scalp for years and after trying tons of things this has worked best.</li>
      <li>Regardless, this strong scent did not dissipate and always left me feeling</li>
      <li>After three months of use, I can say that it really works.</li>
      <li>I still have so much come out every day</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for the past 3 years and have been very pleased with the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall: The scent was really too much for me.</li>
      <li>As with other natural/organic shampoos, I notice that optimum benefits come with regular use.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny and leaves my natural curls soft and bouncy.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Certified organic, cruelty free, Non-GMO, gluten free and made without the typical, traditional cancer causing chemicals, this conditioner works at the hair follicle from the hair’s root to trip.</li>
      <li>This was after I pre-conditioned with coconut oil and used 2x the normal amount of leave-in conditioner afterwards.</li>
      <li>I have tried everything and was most recently a WEN user until it started to dry out my hair after using for a couple of years.</li>
      <li>I have curly, slightly thinning hair, this helps smooth it out.</li>
      <li>My hair comes out thicker, soft and glossy.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair hydrated and soft.</li>
      <li>I find this conditioner to work well after shampooing with my natural shampoo bar.</li>
      <li>I developed an allergy to alcohol and started using Andalou products because they are all natural.  </li>
      <li>results with frequent use</li>
      <li>I was hoping this conditioner would help smooth my hair and tame my flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>: Not only did it have a strong scent but this conditioner really dried out my hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair soft but not flat.  </li>
      <li>, a little goes pretty far so doesn&#x27;t feel wasteful.</li>

<li> Plus, it left my hair feeling dry and rough.</li>
<li> It is more expensive than anything I ordinarily use, but it has lasted for longer than much bigger bottles.</li>
<li> I like that my hair doesn’t acquire a greasy feel and limp look to it just hours after use unlike some traditional shampoos I’ve used for the same job.&lt;br</li>
<li> If my hair has oil from a few days since my last shampoo or if I&#x27;ve worked in the yard, I use a little Andlou Naturals age defying shampoo to get the worst out, then it takes very little a second time to make sure it is totally clean.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really not a fan of the Age Defying duo, because they smell so powdery.</li>
<li> I decided to stop using hair products with questionable chemicals in them, however I could not find a product that provided the same cleaning and conditioning the major brands did.  </li>
<li> I havent noticed any changes in my hair per say, but its just thick enough and smell isnt too off-putting.</li>
<li> I have very long, thick, wavy, color treated hair.  </li>
<li> I leave the conditioner on for a few minutes while I bathe</li>
<li> Last week I switched to a new conditioner and within 3 days I was miserable with itching and had clumps of hair falling out again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner.  Great price and leaves my hair soft and healthy looking.  Nice body.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> When purchasing the shampoo, always get the conditoiner.  It strengthens your hair to actually reduce breakage and loss.  I notice a lot fewer hairs in my brush.  It&#x27;s a great, natural product.</li>
    <li> I developed an allergy to alcohol and started using Andalou products because they are all natural.  I ended uo loving this conditioner more than I expected!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just reordered Andalou Age Defying Conditioner. I leave the conditioner on for a few minutes while I bathe and my hair has the texture and softness it had decades ago. If my hair has oil from a few days since my last shampoo or if I&#x27;ve worked in the yard, I use a little Andlou Naturals age defying shampoo to get the worst out, then it takes very little a second time to make sure it is totally clean. Otherwise, one time is enough. It is more expensive than anything I ordinarily use, but it has lasted for longer than much bigger bottles. I recently purchased it again through Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> So I bought this for hair loss and I do seem to be losing less hair, however the main reason I gave it 5 stars is because I have had extremely itchy scalp for years and after trying tons of things this has worked best. Last week I switched to a new conditioner and within 3 days I was miserable with itching and had clumps of hair falling out again. So I&#x27;m back using it and will not switch again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big big fan of Andalou products! Luckily the Full Volume Shampoo is so nice that I no longer have to use conditioner. I&#x27;m really not a fan of the Age Defying duo, because they smell so powdery. I can&#x27;t say that I saw a difference, so I just don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells heavenly if you love the scent of natural oils, which I do.  It leaves hair soft, smooth, lustrous and shiny.  I&#x27;ve recently begun using this in conjunction with Kiss My Face Every Day Shampoo, and am very happy with results.</li>
    <li> BEST conditioner ever. I have tried everything and was most recently a WEN user until it started to dry out my hair after using for a couple of years. This stuff is amazing, my hair has not been this soft, shiny and full of body in 20 years.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once so I have yet to see a difference but I will still give it (4) stars.  Hopefully this will help my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, love this brand! good for me ingredients, and very important, actually works! Smells great, refreshing! works great, a little goes pretty far so doesn&#x27;t feel wasteful. I have curly, slightly thinning hair, this helps smooth it out. :) I use as leave in after shower and as dries leaves my hair soft and very smooth/no frizz.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, not to heavy, feels like it rinses off nice and clean, leaves hair soft and tangle free</li>
    <li> This is really nice.  I havent noticed any changes in my hair per say, but its just thick enough and smell isnt too off-putting.</li>
    <li> I find this conditioner to work well after shampooing with my natural shampoo bar. It keeps my hair hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> Very gentle on thinning hair.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> excellent, well pleased, no complaints</li>
    <li> Good, high-quality conditioner with good results. I have been using it for about a year. It has a bit of a strong smell, but nothing pungent.</li>
    <li> I waited to review the conditioner to see if it lives up to what it claims to do. After three months of use, I can say that it really works. It leaves my hair soft but not flat.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It smells really nice and makes my hair smooth. So far so good</li>
    <li> This product works by reducing the amount of hair you lose and it does a GREAT job.  It took about a month to start working but I swear it&#x27;s reduced my hair loss (e.g. in the shower) by 70%.  Worth every penny and leaves my natural curls soft and bouncy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 years and have been very pleased with the shampoo and conditioner.  I have very long, thick, wavy, color treated hair.  I decided to stop using hair products with questionable chemicals in them, however I could not find a product that provided the same cleaning and conditioning the major brands did.  I do not know if this product has really helped me grow or thicken my hair, but I am very pleased with the conditioning it gives.  I have thrown out many bottles of natural and organic conditioners because my hair felt like straw after using their conditioners.  My hair stylist always compliments me on the healthy condition of my hair every time I go in for a hair cut.  I tried this product that I originally ordered from another large health food website (which has a lower price), but on that site I would have to purchase $49 to receive free shipping, and their shipping was not always the quickest.

    <li> Caveat: Different hair, different results. This review is based on my experience. I have long, wavy hair that is both fine and thin. I was hoping this conditioner would help smooth my hair and tame my flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like Andalou Naturals products as they tend to get low hazard scores from the EWG database (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep) by using safe ingredients. The conditioner rinsed out easily, leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: Both this conditioner and its shampoo had a strong scent that reminded me of patchouli even though it does not contain any (perhaps it was the cedarwood and/or cloves?). Regardless, this strong scent did not dissipate and always left me feeling \\&quot;off.\\&quot; If you like earthy scents, you might enjoy this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not only did it have a strong scent but this conditioner really dried out my hair. It felt like straw and my flyaways were out of control. This was after I pre-conditioned with coconut oil and used 2x the normal amount of leave-in conditioner afterwards. I also tried using more of this conditioner - nothing seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: The scent was really too much for me. Plus, it left my hair feeling dry and rough. On to the next product . . .</li>
    <li> One of the best in the Naturals world.</li>
    <li> could feel tingling but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair. I still have so much come out every day</li>
    <li> excellent pdt&lt;br /&gt;true results with frequent use</li>
    <li> Renew. Repair. Regenerate. These are the words on the front bottom of the bottle and I believe that is what it does. Certified organic, cruelty free, Non-GMO, gluten free and made without the typical, traditional cancer causing chemicals, this conditioner works at the hair follicle from the hair’s root to trip. I definitely notice the difference whether I use it with the conditioner or not. My hair comes out thicker, soft and glossy. As with other natural/organic shampoos, I notice that optimum benefits come with regular use. I vary the use of my shampoo/conditioners and still it works. I like that my hair doesn’t acquire a greasy feel and limp look to it just hours after use unlike some traditional shampoos I’ve used for the same job.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great conditioner that does the job it’s supposed to do. Couple with or without the matching shampoo, I’m happy with it and recommend it to anyone looking for a thickening shampoo for fine and/or thinning hair while doing good things for the environment, animals and oneself.</li>
