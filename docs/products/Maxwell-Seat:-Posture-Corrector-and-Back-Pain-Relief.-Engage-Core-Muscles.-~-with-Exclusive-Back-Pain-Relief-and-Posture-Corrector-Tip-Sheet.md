      <li>You&#x27;ll wonder how you ever survived without this wonderful, portable &amp;#34;bucket&amp;#34; seat.</li>
      <li>Perfect for sitting at my PC and when I’m driving or flying.</li>
      <li>is the perfect gift to give to anyone at the office.</li>
      <li>Shipping was excellent.</li>
      <li>Great Value!</li>
      <li>Good price too!</li>
      <li>Very effective.</li>
      <li>Simply amazing!</li>
      <li>OMG I love this product!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m taking on-line courses and thought it would be nice to have something aid my posture; I had this on my office chair ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay..</li>
      <li>Stars for sure.</li>
      <li>Excellent for those of us with lower back pain; however, do NOT use on plastic chairs, while driving or while sleeping.</li>
      <li>The others that I referenced were two and three times more costly.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I gave the maxwell seat a try.</li>
      <li>and I feel better.</li>
      <li>The Maxwell seat was better than a trip to the chiropractor.  </li>
      <li>feeling is that for the money, you probably won&#x27;t find a better solution for &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; induced pain and soreness.&lt;br</li>
      <li>can imagine that if you&#x27;re sitting for long periods at a desk, this would also be an excellent ergonomic companion piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a good posture corrector.</li>
      <li>The best product for anyone who sits down all day.  </li>
      <li>Huge help.</li>
      <li>Huge difference.</li>
      <li>I tried it on a variety of seats to see if I could make it fit well and be comfortable, but no luck.</li>
      <li>My new driving companion - Maxwell Seat!!! :-)</li>
      <li>I believe this is one of those products people are excited to try and the manufacturer hopes the rate of purchase exceeds the rate of return.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months in my office &amp; it really helps!</li>
      <li>My back feels better</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this to all lower back pain sufferers in the world (which means most of us), because it will make a WORLD of difference on the&lt;br /&gt;pressure points in your back.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable enough</li>
      <li>Practical, light weight and portable back support.</li>
      <li>I finally feel comfortable sitting for hours at a time at my desk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It allows me to sit comfortably for long periods of time with correct posture.</li>
      <li>A must for commuters, frequent fliers, and office workers!</li>
      <li>Provides tremendous relief in the lower back, especially when sitting for extended periods of time.  </li>
      <li>but I feel like the back is not as straight as I would have hoped.</li>
      <li>The constant pain from sitting too much is gone.</li>
      <li>However, on normal cushioned chairs, you will feel the difference immediately as there is no longer pressure on your lower back where it shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
      <li>Just came back from a week long driving vacation to New Hampshire and Vermont.  </li>
      <li>I realize it&#x27;s made narrow purposely, to keep the tailbone and posture at a certain position, but I&#x27;ve seen others that were somewhat wider that worked just as well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Provides tremendous relief in the lower back, especially when sitting for extended periods of time.  Recommend to all!</li>
    <li> The best product for anyone who sits down all day.  I ordered a second one to keep at home. The constant pain from sitting too much is gone. Huge help. This thing goes everywhere I go!</li>
    <li> What a difference this makes.  Just came back from a week long driving vacation to New Hampshire and Vermont.  This is a game changer! I had NO back pain and I actually felt that I was sitting up correctly.  My new driving companion - Maxwell Seat!!! :-)</li>
    <li> Hello Comfort!!  Purchased as I spend a ton of time at my computer.  I was having trouble with my sciatic nerve and lower back. The Maxwell seat was better than a trip to the chiropractor.  My back feels better and I feel better.</li>
    <li> Helpful for pressure points.  Does not alter sitting angle for me.  You are supposed to be tilted slightly forward to maitain ergo posture as more expensive pad achieves without question.  Will slide around if not pressed against you and back of chair.  Some benefit to be had but not full proof solution to slouching.</li>
    <li> Excellent for those of us with lower back pain; however, do NOT use on plastic chairs, while driving or while sleeping. However, on normal cushioned chairs, you will feel the difference immediately as there is no longer pressure on your lower back where it shouldn&#x27;t be. I strongly recommend this to all lower back pain sufferers in the world (which means most of us), because it will make a WORLD of difference on the&lt;br /&gt;pressure points in your back. Sit on it on a chair for a few minutes, then go back to sitting without it. You&#x27;ll wonder how you ever survived without this wonderful, portable &amp;#34;bucket&amp;#34; seat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but I don&#x27;t feel any change other than the uncomfortable feeling using and constantly adjusting the position, what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.. It&#x27;s comfortable enough but I feel like the back is not as straight as I would have hoped. I still feel like I slouch in it. Used it for a month or so. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference. Haven&#x27;t used it since though.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Not comfortable to sit on all day.  Tried it at my office, in my car and at my dining table and did not feel any benefit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months in my office &amp; it really helps!</li>
    <li> This literally changed my life! Sitting on a stool for extended hours at work left me with unbearable lower and upper back pain. I am so glad I gave the maxwell seat a try. No massage or acupuncture could do what this product has done for me. I use it everywhere now.. I wish I would have found this sooner. My back pain has vanished. Simply amazing!</li>
    <li> It is not comfortable or helpful.</li>
    <li> Huge difference. After 3 days at my office my hip pain was gone. It allows me to sit comfortably for long periods of time with correct posture. A must for commuters, frequent fliers, and office workers!</li>
    <li> Practical, light weight and portable back support. Perfect for sitting at my PC and when I’m driving or flying. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a good posture corrector.</li>
    <li> Hi ... this item is useless.  I&#x27;m taking on-line courses and thought it would be nice to have something aid my posture; I had this on my office chair ... I take on-line coursework and spend a lot of time in that chair.  I believe this is one of those products people are excited to try and the manufacturer hopes the rate of purchase exceeds the rate of return.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this product! I finally feel comfortable sitting for hours at a time at my desk.&lt;br /&gt;I work without having to constantly get up and walk around because my back is killing me.&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect gift to give to anyone at the office. Good price too!</li>
    <li> Works Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps correct my sitting posture and releases the uncomfortable stress from sitting too long. Very effective. Great Value!</li>
    <li> This is a game changer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a daily driving commute that can sometimes get up to 90 minutes each way, and have noticed lately that my back is somewhat cramped and sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune to find something to help the situation, and came upon the Maxwell Seat. This thing has worked like a charm. I find my driving position and posture is altered in the correct ways, and I&#x27;m having way less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can imagine that if you&#x27;re sitting for long periods at a desk, this would also be an excellent ergonomic companion piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feeling is that for the money, you probably won&#x27;t find a better solution for &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; induced pain and soreness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five Stars for sure.</li>
    <li> Shipping was excellent. Unfortunately I did not like the fact that it slides off the seat no cushion on it. Hard plastic not good for long rides or long day at work if you sit all day :-(</li>
    <li> Hard as a rock.  I will be returning it for a padded one.</li>
    <li> Hate it. Put it back in the box after trying several times. I only hope I am not too late to get a refund. I tried it on a variety of seats to see if I could make it fit well and be comfortable, but no luck.</li>
    <li> Works well, however, could be a tad wider. I realize it&#x27;s made narrow purposely, to keep the tailbone and posture at a certain position, but I&#x27;ve seen others that were somewhat wider that worked just as well. They&#x27;re all narrow, but this one is very small.&lt;br /&gt;Considering its cost, it does the job. The others that I referenced were two and three times more costly.</li>
    <li> Does not offer any support.</li>
