      <li>They were easy to apply, although they didn&#x27;t come with glue.</li>
      <li>They were easy to use and reuse.</li>
      <li>They are easy to shape with an eyelash curler.</li>

      <li>My absolute favorite lash set!</li>
      <li>Love these lashes they are super natural looking and give a good length.</li>

      <li>These are amazing lashes that I&#x27;m able to reuse and they never loose their shape.</li>
      <li>Totally familiar with this product.  </li>
      <li>They say they can be worn up to 3-4 times, but really, how germ free and healthy is that?</li>
      <li>I always wear lashes to all special events</li>
      <li>The price is right!</li>
      <li>They fit my eyes just right.</li>
      <li>Convenient and quick shipping</li>
      <li>WHAT YOU FIND IN A STORE!&lt;br /&gt;-extremely long and good price for 4 of them.</li>
      <li>My niece has the same length, naturally, so people always compliment me on my beautiful lashes...</li>
      <li>They were a little bit more than what I wold have liked to pay for for a bundle of them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that Ardell lashes are the most natural looking.  </li>
      <li>they fit better than the cheaper lashes and last longer too!  </li>
      <li>but it was all together worth it.</li>
      <li>but I think these look more natural.</li>
      <li>Get the Ardell waterproof glue to hold these suckers in place and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the heat where I live, I would wear this babies all the time, they are comfortable and they look natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Basically, I love them and I will definitely order again!</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>EXACTLY</li>
      <li>Five stars for the lashes, one star for the advertising/price/packaging (a first for my Amazon experiences).  </li>
      <li>love that they are not heavy unlike other lashes that I have tried before. :-)</li>
      <li>They look natural but at the same time give your eyes more pop!</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and I would buy from this seller again.</li>
      <li>but they are much longer than Whispies.  </li>
      <li>I can reuse them up to about 5-7 times if I gently pull them off my eyes, rather than rinse them off to loosen up the glue.</li>
      <li>they look like real lashes ( if you apply them correctly) and they arent too gaudy.</li>
      <li>I mean there good</li>
      <li>Beautiful lashes, but they&#x27;re a little too long for me and not that very natural looking.</li>
      <li>They may be appropriate for a wedding or some other super special occasion, but not for just going out on a weekend nor everyday use.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these for night or day wear.</li>
      <li>if u want a little more somethin&#x27;somethin</li>
      <li>I like my lashes to be on the longer side but not thick and plastic looking</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend these for special occasions and any other times that you feel like standing out and looking awake.</li>
      <li>That way, no water touches them before I wash my face which will insure the look stays new.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these lashes they are super natural looking and give a good length. Super light weight and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I do like these lashes, but they are a little too much for me (too long). They may be appropriate for a wedding or some other super special occasion, but not for just going out on a weekend nor everyday use. I bought these (113) and a pack of Demi Wispies. The Demi Wispies lashes are far more natural-looking and just make your eyes strikingly beautiful!</li>
    <li> i just love the length!!! they are gorgeous!!</li>
    <li> Favorite brand lashes ever!  Convenient and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Ardell 113 lashes are the best I&#x27;ve seen yet. I think they are better than the Whispies.  They are the same thickness but they are much longer than Whispies.  Both are nice but I find the 113&#x27;s are much more noticeable. You also may want to try using them backwards (use the right lash for your left eye; left lash for your right eye) for a much more dramatic look. With or without eye makeup they still look very natural. My niece has the same length, naturally, so people always compliment me on my beautiful lashes...sadly I have to break the news...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all different styles of lashes and I simply love love love these lashes.  I&#x27;m not that person who&#x27;s trying to make folks think they&#x27;re my natural lashes.  I like false eyelashes and if you do too, then you&#x27;ll love these.  They&#x27;re long and beautiful.</li>
    <li> They look natural but at the same time give your eyes more pop! Love them! Make sure you know how to put them on!</li>
    <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the heat where I live, I would wear this babies all the time, they are comfortable and they look natural.&lt;br /&gt;I love that they are not heavy unlike other lashes that I have tried before. :-) and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review items unless there is a specific reason.  I will say these are great, inexpensive lashes, but the product listing is deceptive.  Although advertised as a \\&quot;pack of 4\\&quot;, this is a pack of two pairs--not 4 pairs.  What, am I only going to wear them one at a time?  It is a shame to have the experience ruined.  Five stars for the lashes, one star for the advertising/price/packaging (a first for my Amazon experiences).  UPDATE:  After talking with customer service via online chat, Amazon took the incredible step of sending a replacement pack (of 4 pairs) via Fed-ex next day with no additional charge.  My faith in Amazon is restored.  From the looks of the pack, this is how the packaging should have been done all along.  Somehow my first pack had been split open and only half sent.  Well done, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! I AM Beautiful crazy!!!</li>
    <li> They were easy to use and reuse. They fit my eyes just right. They are easy to shape with an eyelash curler. Shipping was fast and I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> These are amazing lashes that I&#x27;m able to reuse and they never loose their shape. These are awesome and they work for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these lashes so I had to buy the four pack! In the beauty supply store where I live they go for around 3 bucks so this was a great deal for a product that I&#x27;ve used before. They give the perfect effect of the bright eyed look without looking fake. I hate those lashes that are so dark and full that as soon as you blink the person next to you knows that they&#x27;re falsies. These give the length and volume without being noticeable in the wrong way. I would absolutely recommend these for special occasions and any other times that you feel like standing out and looking awake. I wish I could post a picture... (I would also recommend a good lash curler if you don&#x27;t already have one).</li>
    <li> I just reseve only 1 pack of lash 113 not 4 pack</li>
    <li> Nice but now as full as I like. However, my cousin love them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. I&#x27;ve used ardell 118 also but I think these look more natural. I watched a few YouTube tutorials to learn how to use fake lashes and it helped a TON.</li>
    <li> I like them but they are a little to long and full for me. I like to enhance my real lashes but not have them scream out that I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I only recieved 3 of the actual pair and than the 4th one was in the 113 package but completely different lashes!!</li>
    <li> These are my go to eyelashes I order on a continual basis. I can reuse them up to about 5-7 times if I gently pull them off my eyes, rather than rinse them off to loosen up the glue. That way, no water touches them before I wash my face which will insure the look stays new.</li>
    <li> Use these all the time! They&#x27;re my favorite.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes they are light weight and are easy to apply. I wear them everyday and I get many compliments.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a bodybuilding competition I did - they were PERFECT. They were easy to apply, although they didn&#x27;t come with glue. I already had some DUO glue, though, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge issue. Loved these!</li>
    <li> really enjoy the feel of these they fit better than the cheaper lashes and last longer too!  I get compliments on them all the time.  I highly recommend these for night or day wear.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY WHAT YOU FIND IN A STORE!&lt;br /&gt;-extremely long and good price for 4 of them.</li>
    <li> they are so easy to put on and they are great for going out! they look like real lashes ( if you apply them correctly) and they arent too gaudy. I like big lashes that look a little like they are fake, and these are questionable to people. ;)</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. A good buy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Found these as a reference from one of my favorite youtube beauty gurus and I am in LOVE! So gorgeous and as the photos shows. I am very happy</li>
    <li> ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Been using these for years. Best ever.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite lash set!</li>
    <li> The best lashes you can buy! I love #113 the most out of all Ardell lashes I&#x27;ve purchased. Looks natural yet dramatic.</li>
    <li> These lashes are gorgeous!!! They are long and luscious, yet they look natural at the same time. With mascara, they blend into my lashes perfectly. I will definitely be ordering more and perhaps trying other lashes by Ardell.</li>
    <li> Ardell lashes are my favorite lash brand. I wear false lashes everyday for the past 3 or 4 years now and this is the only brand Im 100% happy with. I always use these for my clients as well (I am a licensed cosmetologist). I like my lashes to be on the longer side but not thick and plastic looking and these are perfect. They were a little bit more than what I wold have liked to pay for for a bundle of them but it was all together worth it. If you are reading this and do not wear false lashes regularly or have not worn them before I will warn you to not cry in them because they will make the lashes soggy, for lack of a better word and pretty much ruin them. If you take care of them they can last you several months! Basically, I love them and I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Not natural looking at all...if thats what you are going for these are not the lashes for u. Very long and exaggerated</li>
    <li> Totally familiar with this product.  As expected and no disappointment. Easier to purchase a quantity rather than 1 at a time.  If lash line to long, snip at the outside end to fit your lid.</li>
    <li> These lashes are great! Having naturally long lashes, I always tend to use the more dramatic lashes (so it actually looks likes I am wearing them). These are super long without being obnoxious - great for going out!!  As with any pair of Ardells, they adhere quite well with the DUO clear glue (after priming and powdering my lids).</li>
    <li> Waaaaay too long and &amp;#34;glamorous&amp;#34; for me but if you like long fakey looking lashes this is for you!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of fake eyelashes and wear them regularly.  I&#x27;ve found that Ardell lashes are the most natural looking.  I have them in different lengths and thicknesses.  Get the Ardell waterproof glue to hold these suckers in place and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> Great product! 4 pairs in the package. affordable and very natural. Will wear this to work on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re so long yet they look so natural. Its the first time when I have a friend recommend this to me and actually liked it ; lol</li>
    <li> Only got 3 pairs instead of 4.</li>
    <li> Even when I&#x27;m lucky enough to get these to adhere in the right spot, they are so dramatically narrow.  The lashes are too long, but can be cut and shaped... but the width of the product is short, so it&#x27;s so blatantly &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking, having lashes pop out 1/4&amp;#34; from the inside of your eyelid.  I was not happy with these.  I know people who cut them into small groups and spread them out over the eyelid... but who has the time and patience for that?  I will admit, I have little experience with false eyelashes.  They might be fine for people who know better what they are doing.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that I saw on line and the makeup artist said she used these....so I found them on amazon and ordered ASAP. When I got them I put then on, didn&#x27;t look nothing like what I wanted. There not natural looking at all. I mean there good if u want a little more somethin&#x27;somethin but wasn&#x27;t what I wanted. Overall a 3.</li>
    <li> I like Ardell lashes so as far as Ardell lashes I would always recommend. I typically don&#x27;t buy them online but I went for it because you cant beat the price. My review is more based on the 113&#x27;s.  I always wear lashes to all special events so I am used to long lashes.  I really love the Runway Ardell lashes and the Edgy&#x27;s.  I dont try to make it seem like Im wearing natural lashes since the lashes I wear are typically dramatic but these were way too animated for me.  I felt like instead of having a soft pretty look they were screaming FAKE LASHES!! My fiance even called me a clown so that&#x27;s not good! If you never wore these before and are shopping around and looking for a little more length but not quite a double stack lash then maybe try the Ardell Edgy lashes before you buy these.</li>
    <li> I truly love these eyelashes, although I need to cut the ends off them, they fit my eyes perfectly. The elastic band bends quite nicely and form fits to anyone&#x27;s eye! They look very natural, so if you are thinking of getting these for a dramatic look, i&#x27;d try something else.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand of falsies I use, because they are affordable (in store, but even more so on Amazon) and they don&#x27;t look ridiculously fake and stay on well! I do not feel bad only wearing them once and throwing me away because they are affordable enough to not have to try to save for the next use. They say they can be worn up to 3-4 times, but really, how germ free and healthy is that? Thank you for making these, I will continue to purchase!</li>
    <li> My favorite lashes. The price is right! I have ordered again and again. I also get about 2-3 wears out if each just stick back in the case when your done and their perfect to re-wear.</li>
    <li> These are a false description of what you get, nothing natural about them .  They look terrible on and are way to dramatic!</li>
    <li> OH my gosh I absolutely love these and such a good price for a 4 pack!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great lashes!!!!</li>
    <li> I only wear false lashes on occasion when i&#x27;m looking to add a little something extra to a look, but i&#x27;m not a fan of incredibly unrealistic or overpowering lashes. These are so wispy and beautiful! (I added mascara for a little extra &amp;#34;drama&amp;#34;) The lashes do not have a thick solid band, so even when you are not wearing liner, they still appear natural! I did not need to trim or curl these lashes before application. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I finally found the perfect lash that looks perfectly natural at the perfect length at a perfect price!  Enough said! PS I also recommend 118</li>
    <li> The didn&#x27;t look so natural on my eyes but it&#x27;s probably because I have small eyes.</li>
    <li> Beautiful lashes, but they&#x27;re a little too long for me and not that very natural looking. If your going for a long semi-dramatic look then these are for you</li>
</ol>
