    <li> I have been using this for a few years, probably since it came out, and it is wonderful for legs, feet, arms, etc.  No real fragrance so you can use your perfume right after applying the lotion.  Absolutely best body lotion for the price.  And it does not smell like Baby Magic, which smells great on a baby but not a the smell for a young grandmother!</li>
    <li> I order this for my husband. He feels that this Is the only lotion that is non greasy and smells light. He has searched for this product in stores, but no one carries it anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I started using it for 2 years now, since 2009. And it is perfect. Feels good, its not greasy. And has a light scent. kind of a light baby scent(?) but its not the baby lotion smell. It smells good though.... can&#x27;t explain a smell though lol so yeah. I just hope i can get a pack of 4 for cheaper! I was walmart had 20oz bottle for less that $6. This deal includes the 16oz bottles that cost about $6... I like deals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. I love this lotion. I&#x27;m a guy and it&#x27;s perfect for me. Try it. you&#x27;ll like it</li>
    <li> Love this hand/body cream, but it&#x27;s hard to find because it&#x27;s being discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry about that!</li>
    <li> I always bought this lotion at walmart and target,but suddenly I could not find it at either store. I always looked for it at every store I went to, but no luck. , so for months, I got a small amount out of an empty bottle. I am so happy that I found it at your web site. there are two reasons why I love this product.  the firsason is the fact that this lotion is not greasy but the greatest reason is the scent.  I am in love with the fragrance. I absolutely love it. thank you so much.i hope that you will continue to make this lotion. PLEASE DON&#x27;T CHANGE A THING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-++++++++++++</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s too bad J&amp;J decided to discontinue this product</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion; I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly fine moisturizer; however beware, the formula has changed. The new formula, according to my wife, uses much more scent, and is much less appealing.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and makes my hands soft and smooth, love the sent of it too. Needed so badly for my rough hands, thanks.</li>
    <li> Used this product for many year then I couldn&#x27;t find it. I found it on Amazon and I feel it is not like it used to be.  A little disappointed.</li>
    <li> WHY Oh WHY did J&amp;J stop making this lotion it is my favorite. Great Lotion smells good and last all day.</li>
    <li> This product has out-performed any and all other skin care moisturizers I have ever purchased. It is a discontinued product from Johnson &amp; Johnson and I was thrilled to find it on amazon.  The product came well packaged and on time.</li>
    <li> i like the very light fresh scent that does not overpower or interfere with my perfume... leaves my skin soft and smooth all day</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion, it does not leave my hands greasy.  But come on...back in January of this year I paid $15.88 for 4 bottles, now it is $46.25 for 4 bottles.  OUTRAGEOUS!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It doesn&#x27;t give me a greasy feeling after I put it on and it makes my skin so soft!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion and cannot find it in local stores at home so was super excited amazon had it!</li>
    <li> Glad I got so much, it&#x27;s not on the shelves.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. Non-greasy, barely a scent, great moisture. The only one I&#x27;ve used for years. Can&#x27;t believe they discontinued it. I stocked up!</li>
    <li> USE THIS EVERY NIGHT.  LIKE THE SMELL OF THIS AND IT KEEPS MY HANDS NICE AND SOFT.  WILL BUY AGAIN WHEN I RUN OUT OF THIS.</li>
    <li> Super product.  Have tied a lot of lotions; this one leaves skin well cared for, especially those dry winter legs.</li>
    <li> Been using this lotion for years &amp; without a doubt it is the best lotion for all over body care, no question about it &amp; I have used a lot of different kinds.  So sorry it is so hard to get since Johnson &amp; Johnson has stopped making it.  Too many women didn&#x27;t know how good it is &amp; the price was really good.</li>
    <li> I recommend this body lotion for baby. Have been using for years without problem.&lt;br /&gt;Such an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, glad to see I can still buy it here since it seems all brick and mortar stores have stopped selling it. I&#x27;ve used this for years, it keeps my hands really soft.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It holds true to the 24 hour moisture. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy. I now use it on my face as a daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great.  Exactly as was listed.  Great service.</li>
    <li> My wife has me continue to purchase this at an alarming rate. Apparently its the best lotion on earth for a good price. O, and you cant but it in stores because its discontinued? whatever, she loves it, so I love it.</li>
    <li> Best lotion I have ever found and have used it for many, many years!  LOVE IT PERIOD!!!</li>
    <li> The one that I bought earlier was the 4-pack of Johnson&#x27;s Body Care Deep Hydrating Extra Dry Skin Lotion.  It seems that this has been discontinued so I bought what you had in stock which was the Johnson&#x27;s Body Care 24 Hour Body Lotion.  I figured it would have pretty much the same very light, not too overpowering smell.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  The new one has a very strong smell and I don&#x27;t like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wear anything that is strong like that but I haven&#x27;t contacted you to return it yet as I kept hoping someone somewhere would have it in stock.  This has not been the case, thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the negative review but you asked and I&#x27;m telling you the truth as I see it.  Maybe others would like the smell but I cannnot tolerate it.</li>
    <li> Best body lotion that I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  No greasy, sticky feel and your skin feels really soft after using.  Great product.</li>
    <li> The pack was a special price for my dear wife who enjoys this Johnson&#x27;s Body Care Lotion much.  It has been hard finding it and seeing the package made her face light up when she received it.</li>
    <li> iT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IF THEY WOULD ADD THE INGREDIENTS ! THERE ARE TWO FORMULAS! THE NEW HAS MINERAL OIL IN IT ! I WANT THE OLD FORMULA WITHOUT MINERAL CAN ANYONE HELP! THE BOTTLES ARE DIFFERNT TOO THE OLD FORMULA SAY 24HOUR BODY LOTION  AND THE NEW SAY 24 HOUR LOTION . BECAREFUL WHEN BUYING ASK FOR INGREDIENTS ! THEY HAVE THE WRONG PICTURE POSTED !</li>
    <li> Bought online in bulk because this lotion suddenly disappeared from all grocery and drugstores near me - come to find out Johnson&#x27;s has discontinued their Body Care line. Panicked and bought a bunch of it online. It is the only body lotion I&#x27;ve ever found to be truly light and yet still moisturizes... I am really sad that Johnson&#x27;s has stopped making it.</li>
    <li> For some reason J&amp;J discontinued this product but my Wife loves it so I found it here and bought extra.</li>
    <li> I had been so disappointed that stores don&#x27;t carry this product any more.  I was very happy to be able to find the product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion that actually work for my sensitive skin and keeps my skin soft. I would definitely recommend this lotion for every day use.</li>
    <li> This product leaves my skin so soft and not oily.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this product for several years because it isn&#x27;t greasy like most lotions.  We noticed that it was becoming increasingly more difficult to find; but last night, I drove to six separate stores (major chains) with no luck.  When I got home, I searched it on Amazon and I was pleasantly surprised to find it here.  After reading the reviews, my suspicions were confirmed - Johnson&#x27;s has discontinued the product.  The four-pack should last for a while, but I&#x27;m considering getting another four-pack to ensure that we have enough to last for a couple of years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Best absorbing lotion ever...penetrating, non greasy.  Makes skin soft.  Really, really love it</li>
    <li> This lotion is no longer available in stores so was glad to find online. Price was ok usually got this cheaper at Target &amp; Wal-mart</li>
    <li> I LOVED this lotion. Smooths on without greasiness and lasts a long time. It is so gentle that I could even use it on my face.Then it gets discontinued. So I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love the product and was unable to purchase it in the stores.  It was in its original packaging and I was happy to have the body lotion again.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but it is hard to find.  I like the multi-pack for convenience.  Very good value for the price....</li>
    <li> Keep hands from getting dry in the winter.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite lotion! I&#x27;m so upset that they discontinued it. However I buy it on amazon in bulk so I&#x27;m good to go. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product is great, but I was unable to obtain it in retail stores. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years and from time to time get comments on how smooth my hands are.  It is absorbed easily and leaves no stickiness.  I have been unable to buy it in stores for a while and have been able to buy it online.  It appears it is no longer being manufactured, so I purchased a supply to last me a while.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Such a shame J&amp;J has discontinued it.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and this is the only place I can find it. No, it&#x27;s not the baby scent, it&#x27;s a fresh light scent for adults that won&#x27;t overwhelm.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years &amp; was so distraught that they discontinued it. I have sensitive skin &amp; most other lotions break me out. This one is gentle, smooth &amp; I love the sent.&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find some stores still selling it through amazon. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This feels just like expensive body lotions, and really does keep my skin moisturized all day long. I use it on both  my girls as well. Smell not at all offensive or strong.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best products for dry skin.  It dries quickly and your skin truly feels soft for hours and hours.  I have my whole family using it.  Nothing better.</li>
    <li> the scent is amazing, light, but enough for my boyfriend to smell on me. makes skin very soft. great price.</li>
    <li> Why dont they sell this product in the store anymore. It is great for dry skin, my entire family loves it.</li>
    <li> I will get it. I know it will get to my post office box.</li>
    <li> welll this is what my wife likes, so if shes happy that means im happy. meaning ill be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I use this product extensively and within the past two years, it has become increasingly more difficult to find it. The lotion is usually very moist, non-sticky and the fragrance lasts for hours ... very subtle, even after washing your hands.  When I received this product, immediately out of the bottle I noticed it was not the same texture.  It felt less moist than the usual and when rubbed into the skin, it did not leave the smooth feel I was accustomed to.  The fragrance is similar, but not the same, and I noticed, it did not stay with me after washing.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it work so well for both myself and my kids but I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores any more. When I ordered it I was so excited and it only took two days for it to get here!! Awsome!!</li>
    <li> I simply love this body lotion.  It keeps you moisturized all day long and it is not greasy. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> lighthly sented! Nose does not like strong sents! does work for 24 hrs!  would recomend to people with alleriges as it does not envade your space as many other lotions do!</li>
    <li> Originally bought it at Walmart and never could find it again.  Not at Target, Costco, CVS, Walmart, etc.  Turns out that it&#x27;s discontinued.  We liked it so much, smelled wonderful, not too greasy, and perfect for delicate skin so we bought as much as we could.  Not only does my 5 year old daughter love it, so do I and her father.</li>
