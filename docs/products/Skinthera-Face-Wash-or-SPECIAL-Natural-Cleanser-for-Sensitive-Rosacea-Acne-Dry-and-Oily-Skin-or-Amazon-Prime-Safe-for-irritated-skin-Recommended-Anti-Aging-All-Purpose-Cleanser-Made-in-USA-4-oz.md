      <li>I ordered the Best FaceWash - Part of Skinthera Skincare System by Pure Life Labs and have fully utilized it to determine efficacy, reliability, and</li>
      <li>Amazing...</li>
      <li>, it works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning your face (and don’t forget your neck and chest area)</li>
      <li>The ingredient list is amazing: aloe, chamomile, Vitamin E, and honey.</li>
      <li>received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>

      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the Best FaceWash - Part of Skinthera Skincare System by Pure Life Labs and would recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&gt;★ Reduces the hesitation to purchases a beauty product because it&#x27;s safe to use (Paraban free, Nut free, Fragrance Free, Colorant Free, and Cruelty free)&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>To be honest at first I was so hesitant to try this because I&#x27;m not so familiar</li>
      <li>This facial cleaser is great .IBenn</li>
      <li>My skin was smooth without any feeling of tightness..</li>
      <li>Overall, great consistency.</li>
      <li>It has a clean scent to it.  </li>
      <li>It leaves her skin feeling clean and supple.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s great to find a cleanser that is organic and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
      <li>Skinthera face wash makes my face feel clean, fresh and smooth.</li>
      <li>Additionally, I received additional emails providing details about the product, which gives more information that was very helpful.</li>
      <li>My only con with this was that it did not give me a good lather that I prefer when cleansing.</li>
      <li>I will absolutely purchase more of this product.</li>
      <li>Not only did that make me a happy camper, but it cleaned very thoroughly as well.</li>
      <li>I felt the difference the very first time I washed my face.</li>
      <li>and this the first time I have rated a product for Amazon!  </li>
      <li>I wish it was SLS free, but other wise very gentle.</li>
      <li>: If you want an environmentally safe and natural beauty face wash, this one is a keeper...</li>
      <li>: If you want an environmentally safe and natural beauty face wash, this one is a keeper...</li>
      <li>Great for daily use and sensitive skin IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many organic facial cleansers.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I immediately felt the difference.  </li>
      <li>Many times sensitive skin products are not as powerful as I would like, but this one definitely makes me smile .</li>
      <li>However not being able to use it more than once it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle formula leaves my skin clean, soft and feeling hydrated.  </li>
      <li>My face is super sensitive to any and everything I put on it</li>
      <li>My wife was looking for a new face wash and this came at the right time.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and lots of problems with my pores clogging up.</li>
      <li>, this cleaned my face very well.  </li>
      <li>This face wash has Aloe Vera as its ingredients which really helps.</li>
      <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
      <li>It left my face clean and feeling very soft.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>Some cleanser sometimes doesn&#x27;t really work good in my face and it usually makes my face so dry,</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and had no reaction to this cleanser.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin very soft and supple.</li>
      <li>When I got mine most of it had poured out of the package the little that was left</li>
      <li>, it stays really soft and moisturized</li>
      <li>My eyes thank the company for making this with all natural ingredients because my eyes never burn after using and my skin feels...refreshed.</li>
      <li>This product has worked well for me this far.</li>
      <li>With oily and sensitive skin I do not have a lot of options for moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Also, a vast majority of the cleanser/makeup removers I have used really burn my eyes.</li>
      <li>and it still leaves my face baby soft.</li>
      <li>Cost-effective Anti-Aging Beauty product (natural ingredients that are helpful for all ages)&lt;br</li>
      <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly when I received the bottle, I thought “well this won’t last long” but I was mistaken because I quickly learned that all I need is a dime-size amount of cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I use this with my clarisonic and it leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized, not dry like some other removers tend to.</li>
      <li>I usually try and purchase facial products that are hypoallergenic, fragrance free and as pure as possible.  </li>
      <li>The cleanser has no fragrance that I have noticed and visually it is pleasing to the eye because it actually looks pure.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very oily and it took all the oil off my face but didn&#x27;t leave me too dry.</li>
      <li>, you will notice your skin is soft, it does not strip the oils from your face which means no dry, flaky patches of skin.  </li>
      <li>I am interested in trying other products in this line.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that has helped my skin clear up.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I appreciate the natural ingredients that I look for when utilizing such beauty products.</li>
      <li>I am 48 years old and my facial cleansing routine has changed dramatically since I was in my 20’s.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it at night and the next morning my skin is glowing and soft.</li>
      <li>I would state that by removing the ammonium laureth sulfate (for sudsy action), that would have pushed my review up to a 5-star product because it does make the overall effect a bit drying on the skin.</li>

However not being able to use it more than once it&#x27;s hard to tell. That&#x27;s why the three stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great new cleanser.  It&#x27;s gentle formula leaves my skin clean, soft and feeling hydrated.  I definitely recommend trying Skinthera!</li>
    <li> Totally awesome face wash! I felt the difference the very first time I washed my face. I&#x27;m very oily and it took all the oil off my face but didn&#x27;t leave me too dry. I love it!</li>
    <li> What a great refreshing cleanser!  I love the way my face feels after using this product and the fragrance is lovely.  I would highly recommend this product.  I am interested in trying other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Skinthera face wash makes my face feel clean, fresh and smooth. Non irritating. Nice to find a chemical free and organic wash that won&#x27;t break the bank.  A small amount of wash goes a long way. I have oily skin and have had problems in past where other products irritate my skin and cause it to get oiler.  Not skinthera!  I am impressed with this product that I am looking into their product line for other items. I received skinthera face wash at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> I usually try and purchase facial products that are hypoallergenic, fragrance free and as pure as possible.  Since the description of this “Best Face Wash” fits the criteria I agreed to try it.  It’s a well-known fact that as you age you must treat your skin differently than you did in your younger years, no more harsh products.  I am 48 years old and my facial cleansing routine has changed dramatically since I was in my 20’s.  This translates into no more harsh chemicals, gritty scrubs and late nights for me.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly when I received the bottle, I thought “well this won’t last long” but I was mistaken because I quickly learned that all I need is a dime-size amount of cleanser.  I remove my make-up every night with Cetaphil and started using the “Best Face Wash” in the morning while in the shower, followed by toner and a light moisturizer.  My opinion was there is no way this cleanser can remove make-up since it looks too lightweight but I was wrong, it works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;After cleaning your face (and don’t forget your neck and chest area), you will notice your skin is soft, it does not strip the oils from your face which means no dry, flaky patches of skin.  The cleanser has no fragrance that I have noticed and visually it is pleasing to the eye because it actually looks pure.  Great product and I will become a customer.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Very nice! It left my face clean and feeling very soft.  My face wasn&#x27;t tight or dry afterwards.  However, if your wearing long wearing eye makeup like I was today, you will have to use an eye makeup remover.  Other than that, this cleaned my face very well.  It has a clean scent to it.  Actually, my skin feels like satin.  It&#x27;s very soft and smooth.</li>

    <li> My wife was looking for a new face wash and this came at the right time. She loves this face wash. It leaves her skin feeling clean and supple. The ingredient list is amazing: aloe, chamomile, Vitamin E, and honey. The best part is that it is organic. You also can&#x27;t go wrong with their money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> I am always slightly skeptical when trying new facial products because I have sensitive skin. Also, a vast majority of the cleanser/makeup removers I have used really burn my eyes.

    <li> Awesome product. I have very oily skin and lots of problems with my pores clogging up. This is the only product that has helped my skin clear up. Get this facial cleaner, you won&#x27;t be srry.</li>
    <li> Pretty great cleanser.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks now and it still leaves my face baby soft.</li>
    <li> Amazing...&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many organic facial cleansers.  The first time I used it, I immediately felt the difference.  My skin was smooth without any feeling of tightness.. I am sold and will continue to use this cleanser ..and this the first time I have rated a product for Amazon!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This facial cleaser is great .IBenn using this for a month now and and this is really great,It cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t make my face dry.Some cleanser sometimes doesn&#x27;t really work good in my face and it usually makes my face so dry, To be honest at first I was so hesitant to try this because I&#x27;m not so familiar plus I hate that it will dry up my face but good thing I gave this a shot because this product is really working great on my face.My face is more clearer and smoother now.I will absolutely purchase more of this product.</li>
    <li> It works well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.  I wish it was SLS free, but other wise very gentle.</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this cleanser!  I can feel it hydrating my skin as it cleans all the makeup off my face. I have been using it at night and the next morning my skin is glowing and soft. My skin is pretty sensitive so it&#x27;s great to find a cleanser that is organic and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  I would definitely recommend this cleanser!</li>
    <li> I love the organic face wash. I have always been searching for a face wash that is gentle for my skin and does not have any harsh chemicals. And I am very happy to have this one. It leaves my skin very soft and supple. It is very ideal for my oily skin. With oily and sensitive skin I do not have a lot of options for moisturizer. This face wash has Aloe Vera as its ingredients which really helps. This product comes with a discount coupon. I will surely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Been using this facial wash for days days now and I should say my skin is improving. My blemishes are getting lesser and lesser day by day. I love the refreshing sensation when I massage my face with this product. Will definitely recommend to a friend!!!</li>
    <li> This face wash is pretty good. My face is super sensitive to any and everything I put on it and I can honestly say after using 3 days, it didn&#x27;t disrupt and make me break out. I have dry patches in different spots of my face and this appeared to help it a little bit. Overall, great consistency. Not watery at all and lathers well. Great for daily use and sensitive skin IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Love it! It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, it stays really soft and moisturized</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and had no reaction to this cleanser. Not only did that make me a happy camper, but it cleaned very thoroughly as well. Many times sensitive skin products are not as powerful as I would like, but this one definitely makes me smile .</li>
