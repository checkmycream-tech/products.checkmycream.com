      <li>Cheap price but luxurious scent</li>

      <li>The original perfume had a fragrance that lasted until you washed it off.  </li>
      <li>It SO reminds me of the original SKIN BY BONNE BELL.  </li>
      <li>but this is the original trust</li>

      <li>till this day 2015 I still original bottle &amp; so does my mom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not the original scent.</li>
      <li>This product is nothing like the original Skin Musk by Bonnie Bell.  </li>
      <li>I think it smells different on everyone because it combines with your own body scent thus a unique scent on each person</li>
      <li>Still a great everyday scent.</li>
      <li>By far my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>Such a nice compliment.</li>
      <li>years ago I was in elementary school 1990&#x27;s...</li>
      <li>Love the soft smell of this perfume.</li>
      <li>Take your Skin with you and do it right</li>
      <li>and I loved the one with the Gold Cap (the previous formula).</li>
      <li>Thanks anyway !</li>
      <li>and I just happen to see the product and thought to myself this could not be the same one that J C Penny doesnt carry any more.</li>
      <li>The oil is the magic key.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely my fav!</li>
      <li>THANKS !</li>
      <li>The smell today is only a shadow of the unique original fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Not as strong a scent as I recently purchased</li>
      <li>It certainly lasts on clothing for days and sheets as well.</li>
      <li>I received my order in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t want to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews about the current green top not being like the gold top, but I&#x27;m glad with the change.</li>
      <li>VERY dissapointed in this as it was advertised to be the same as the original formula...</li>
      <li>Once I started blending those two together, I began getting compliments on my perfume again like I used to back in the day with the original Skin.</li>
      <li>Not the original scent I remember back in the 80&#x27;s..</li>
      <li>Believe it or not, I still have a few drops of the original oil in the original bottle (with the gold round top)</li>
      <li>If the scent would last like it did back in the 90&#x60;s, I would buy a lot more of it.</li>
      <li>there is something missing for sure</li>
      <li>I purchased regularly when it was made by Bonne Bell &amp; now purchase the same original product from Amazon</li>
      <li>I was so very sad when I wasn&#x27;t able to find my favorite scent where I live anymore.</li>
      <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original Bonnie Bell.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this fragrance since 1968, given to me by, yes of course, an old boyfriend.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 59 years old and have been wearing it since I was 17.</li>
      <li>I get stopped in the street all the time by people wanting to know what this is and they&#x27;re usually surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s an inexpensive teeny-bopper product.</li>
      <li>now use on my 4 yr old twins.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My (adult) children tell me it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Sutle soft musk scent.</li>
      <li>Then over that,  I add a very small amount of the Prada Candy on top of the film of oil,  and rub them together.  </li>
      <li>What happened, the scent used to linger on into the evening hours, now you can barely smell it.  </li>
      <li>The current company has changed the formula and it is much, much weaker and definitely does not last.  </li>
      <li>I used other oils in the past but this sent will last the ENTIRE day and you will love the smell!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Skin was my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume in high school back in 1978 not to mention it drove me crazy, over time she could not find it .</li>

<li> It&#x27;s hard to say much about a hammer.</li>
<li> Not long lasting like previous from years ago.</li>
<li> I have read the reviews from other people and i totally agree, this Bonne Bell Oil is definitely not the same as it was at least ten to fifteen years ago.  </li>
<li> bought 2 bottles 1 for me and my daughter, we both agree its not the same smell, or thickness, there are no compliments at all when i got them everyday.</li>
<li> I agree with the other reviews that it&#x27;s not at all what it used to be.  </li>
<li> if you have other perfumes,  try blending them with the Skin OIL.  </li>
<li> The scent seems to be true enough, but I am a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t linger longer.</li>
<li> my little girls like to sit and stand close to me because they like the way I smell.  </li>
<li> ; that never leaves a heavy smell in the elevators.</li>
<li> Wasted my money.</li>
<li> I have been using Skin Musk by Bonne Bell for years and was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t buy it anywhere suddenly.</li>
<li> , not sure why</li>
<li> It is hard to locate it around here.</li>
<li> Not really happy with it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff smells great! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original Bonnie Bell.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume have used it for years!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this Skin Musk for over 40 years. I love it. It is hard to locate it around here. It does not break me out.</li>
    <li> Not the original scent. Not long lasting like previous from years ago.Same bottle but not same product as Bonnie Bell.</li>
    <li> Not the original scent I remember back in the 80&#x27;s.. there is something missing for sure but I do get compliments all the time that I smell really good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say much about a hammer. Either it is as described or it&#x27;s not. This one is.</li>
    <li> Scent fades very quickly!  I have worn this musk oil for about 12 years and I loved the one with the Gold Cap (the previous formula). The current company has changed the formula and it is much, much weaker and definitely does not last.  The scent evaporated after 5 minutes on my skin. Sadly, I will now have to try and find another Musk Oil to be my signature scent.</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews from other people and i totally agree, this Bonne Bell Oil is definitely not the same as it was at least ten to fifteen years ago.  What happened, the scent used to linger on into the evening hours, now you can barely smell it.  This was my second time purchasing this oil, but not anymore.  Thanks anyway !</li>
    <li> This product is nothing like the original Skin Musk by Bonnie Bell.  The original perfume had a fragrance that lasted until you washed it off.  It was oiler and thicker than this watery product.  I am very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use to get this Skin Musk at J C Penny in Columbus, OH years ago! One day I was browsing through Amazon and I just happen to see the product and thought to myself this could not be the same one that J C Penny doesnt carry any more. I ordered it and when it arrive all I could say is.... I FOUND IT AT LAST!!!  I used other oils in the past but this sent will last the ENTIRE day and you will love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smelling Good in Columbus, OH!</li>
    <li> Absolutely my fav! I started wearing this in the 80&#x27;s. Several years ago i could no longer buy Skin Musk Oil by Bonne Bell in retail stores. I will forever be getting it with AMAZON.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Bonne Bell Skin Musk perfume since 7th grade and nothing else I&#x27;ve worn can even come close. I get stopped in the street all the time by people wanting to know what this is and they&#x27;re usually surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s an inexpensive teeny-bopper product. :) I prefer the oil to the perfume spray and can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores so I am glad I can order it here.</li>
    <li> I was so very sad when I wasn&#x27;t able to find my favorite scent where I live anymore. My husband suggested I check amazon.com and how happy I was to find several sellers.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews about the current green top not being like the gold top, but I&#x27;m glad with the change. The gold cap use to fade and come off on my hands.  I receive compliments on the scent all the time and I love the &amp;#34;fresh, clean, fragrance&amp;#34; that never leaves a heavy smell in the elevators. I will be purchasing again soon.</li>
    <li> VERY dissapointed in this as it was advertised to be the same as the original formula...the consistancy and color is not the same nor is the staying power of the fragrance....it makes me so sad this is no longer available in it&#x27;s original state.  I have been using this musk oil since 1966.  Seems I will need to find a replacement and I really don&#x27;t want to.</li>
    <li> been my favorite musk for years</li>
    <li> My dad bought this for me years ago I was in elementary school 1990&#x27;s... till this day 2015 I still original bottle &amp; so does my mom.&lt;br /&gt;I now use on my 4 yr old twins.&lt;br /&gt;However I must say the smell and the thickness NOT SAME.</li>
    <li> it was not the smell i remember wearing in 1989. bought 2 bottles 1 for me and my daughter, we both agree its not the same smell, or thickness, there are no compliments at all when i got them everyday. this got my daughter hooked on smelling the fragrance on me.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I loved it many years ago. Still a great everyday scent.</li>
    <li> I love a clean smell and Skin Musk Oil is so light and not over powering.  I teach Sunday School and my little girls like to sit and stand close to me because they like the way I smell.  Such a nice compliment.</li>
    <li> Skin was my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume in high school back in 1978 not to mention it drove me crazy, over time she could not find it . So when I saw it on Amazon I could not wait to smell it again . It&#x27;s perfect still drives me nuts. THANKS !</li>
    <li> I cannot stand the scent of most perfumes.They tend to give me headaches. I&#x27;ve worn the musk oil for 30 years. I cannot smell it after I put it on, but everyone else will tell me how nice I smell , even after having worn it for up to 16 Hours.I received my order in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> Best 80&#x27;s perfume which still has people inquiry what is that scent?? Cheap price but luxurious scent</li>
    <li> I love, love Bonne Bell musk oil.  This is the only thing I wear and, i have been wearing it for over 45 Years. Everyone can&#x27;t wear this product. it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on everyone.  I have got so many compliments about the smell.  Years ago they had The dusting&lt;br /&gt;powder and lotion, I had it all.  Thank you for carrying this product.  I don&#x27;t have to drive 5 miles for it.  Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyce Bracey</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s my signature scent and I love it :-)&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s a couple copies out there but this is the original trust me I know</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance since 1968, given to me by, yes of course, an old boyfriend.  I still love it. Some say it has changed, what has not? I always get a compliment or two and that&#x27;s nice after 47 years!!</li>
    <li> Love the soft smell of this perfume. Been wearing this for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> Love this... been using it for years... many compliments for the fragrance...</li>
    <li> The oil seemed thinner than the original, and the scent does not seem to be as long-lasting. Believe it or not, I still have a few drops of the original oil in the original bottle (with the gold round top) so I am not just relying on memory. The scent seems to be true enough, but I am a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t linger longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 59 years old and have been wearing it since I was 17. The scent changed over the years along&lt;br /&gt;with my body chemistry, but it&#x27;s always delightful. Not a week has gone by that I haven&#x27;t received a&lt;br /&gt;compliment from strangers as well as friends. It is definitely an A+.</li>
    <li> It is the best ever and I have been using it for 40 years</li>
    <li> Sutle soft musk scent.</li>
    <li> I discovered this amazing perfume in 1978 and have used it since.  The smell today is only a shadow of the unique original fragrance.  EVERYONE loved it.  I agree with the other reviews that it&#x27;s not at all what it used to be.  But, I buy it anyway.  My (adult) children tell me it&#x27;s \\&quot;my\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;However, I want to tell you what I have discovered.  If you use it together with another fragrance that you like,  it changes the smell of your second fragrance to something FABULOUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example,  I also love the smell of Prada Candy.  But,  my chemistry can change a fragrance like Prada Candy into something too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I now will put Skin on my wrists,  and rub them together,  leaving a visible film of the oil.  Then over that,  I add a very small amount of the Prada Candy on top of the film of oil,  and rub them together.  OMG!!!  This creates the most wonderful fragrance!!!  It SO reminds me of the original SKIN BY BONNE BELL.  Give it a try.  If you don&#x27;t have the Prada Candy,  try a tiny sample at your local department store.  Take your Skin with you and do it right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,  if you have other perfumes,  try blending them with the Skin OIL.  It does not work with the Skin spray.  The oil is the magic key.  So for this reason, I will keep buying Skin and the Prada Candy.  Once I started blending those two together, I began getting compliments on my perfume again like I used to back in the day with the original Skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Skin Musk by Bonne Bell for years and was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t buy it anywhere suddenly.So being able to find it online is truly wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love the light fragrance.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite perfume. I constantly get told that I smell great &amp; get asked what perfume I use I say &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; which initially confuses people. I purchased regularly when it was made by Bonne Bell &amp; now purchase the same original product from Amazon plus I buy 3-4 at a time so I don&#x27;t run out. I think it smells different on everyone because it combines with your own body scent thus a unique scent on each person</li>
    <li> I adore this fragrance and always get compliments on it when I wear it. I have noticed that if my skin is dry, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long, so I generally use a little unscented baby oil on my skin before putting on my perfume and that makes it last a long, long time. It certainly lasts on clothing for days and sheets as well. Men seem to like this exceptionally well. There is just nothing like this scent and I&#x27;m thankful they still make it.</li>
    <li> Same as the cologne....alluring!</li>
    <li> Not really happy with it. I used this product years ago and loved it! But this IS NOT the same thing!! The scent is gone within a short time, I can&#x60;t smell it anymore! If the scent would last like it did back in the 90&#x60;s, I would buy a lot more of it. I wish it was the same.</li>
    <li> Not as strong a scent as I recently purchased, not sure why</li>
    <li> This is not the same scent as Bonnie Bell Skin Musk. Disappointing. Wasted my money.</li>
