      <li>Takes longer than most mascara to apply because there are 2 steps</li>
      <li>you are aging and your lashes are becoming shorter, and you do not want to splurge for Latisse</li>
      <li>The application is easy and it does not curdle.</li>
      <li>While I do not think any company will make better waterproof mascara than Maybelline (which I used when I swam competitively for years), this mascara does a good enough job staying on.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for still having some :)</li>
      <li>This has been my main mascara for many years now and it has never disappointed me.</li>
      <li>This is one of those mascaras that gets better as it gets older (a tip</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this kind of mascara for several years.  </li>
      <li>It used to be so easy to find in all the drugstores, now that there are so many other &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; brands this one has gone by the wayside......</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and no other mascara I&#x27;ve tried comes close to being as good as this one.  </li>
      <li>I use an eyelash curler first and then apply the extender and then the mascara.</li>
      <li>Will buy more next time</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
      <li>At the end of the day I either use a makeup remover or just a warm wet cloth to take it off.</li>

      <li>This will be my new mascara for ever.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Thanks for having the last of this product for sale.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m nearly 50yrs.</li>
      <li>Beware of this vendor - I ordered mascara and the products were so old they would be unsafe to use near the eye.  </li>
      <li>The waterproof formula is also decent enough.  </li>
      <li>if you don&#x27;t know yet is to wipe the brush on a tissue the first couple times you use it so its not so wet - thus easier to layer on).</li>
      <li>Need to be sure I buy black and not brown black next time.</li>
      <li>When I received this mascara, it was dry and old.</li>
      <li>I liked the extend mascara but the waterproof version tends to be dry from opening and get dryer making it flakier and difficult to use</li>
      <li>can be a little too much for my coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll try out other new mascaras</li>

<li> I started using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Lash Serum two months ago, and now my eyelashes are almost as long as they were when I was younger.  </li>
<li> I really like that it comes in brown because I have very pale blonde eyelashes and medium blonde hair and black mascara</li>

<li> I am having a heck of a time finding mascara that actually works AND that is organic or at least low on the hazard score (EWG -- environmental working group site).  </li>
<li> This mascara manages to stay on my lashes well, and if it does get wet</li>
<li> old and my lashes are starting to thin.  </li>
<li> just so you don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m hoity-toity for spending a ridiculous amount of money on French designer mascara, years ago when TSA enacted the liquids ban I had my Double Extend confiscated at the airport on the way to a business trip in Asia</li>
<li> My lower lashes are very long, and if I do not use waterproof mascara then I will develop black dots under my eyes from the ends of the lashes.  </li>
<li> The mascara tube lasts longer than any other brand I have tried.  </li>
<li> It just does the same effect as very expensive mascara, at a very reasonable price.</li>
<li> My lashes went from being roughly half a centimeter without mascara to seven to eight millimeters.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;;t like black as well as the black brown because even though it&#x27;s waterproof, it smudges.</li>
<li> /&gt;Double Extend lengthens and thickens eyelashes without looking messy</li>
<li> olde and dried out whot</li>
<li> but because I am a nurse, I did not want people to be using such outdated makeup.</li>
<li> (this was before you could take a 1 quart bag of small liquids</li>
<li> I even had a $30+ tube of some expensive French designer mascara once</li>
<li> The mascara has two steps -- a base and then the mascara -- this is the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, because it takes a tiny bit longer to get out the door.</li>
<li> I  have used this mascara for at least 10 years.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m 54 and my lashes are not as thick anymore.  </li>
<li> My thin lashes look thick with this product.</li>
<li> I have thin eyelashes and</li>
<li> (some thickening mascaras look sloppy).  </li>
<li> My eyelashes are also hard to please!!</li>
<li> but so sad it&#x27;s been discontinued.  </li>
<li> /&gt;There is something really wrong with Corp. America these days ...</li>
<li> and I was not impressed.  </li>
<li> It is really sad when you have to order your mascara on line because stores won&#x27;t stock brown !&lt;</li>

    <li> olde and dried out whot I want my $  back</li>
    <li> I am having a heck of a time finding mascara that actually works AND that is organic or at least low on the hazard score (EWG -- environmental working group site).  I like this mascara, because it works well and I can actually find places to purchase it from.  The mascara has two steps -- a base and then the mascara -- this is the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, because it takes a tiny bit longer to get out the door.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I&#x27;m 54 and my lashes are not as thick anymore.  This product thickens and lengthens my lashes.  Love it, love it!!!</li>
    <li> love this mascara but so sad it&#x27;s been discontinued.  Thanks for still having some :)</li>
    <li> Lash fortifier makes my short lashes longer and fuller, then I apply the mascara. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> Thanks for having the last of this product for sale. I will miss not having it as it is the best Mascara I have ever used. Can not buy the Brown/Black in the staore anymore and now can not find it on line until this moment. Bought all 7 left!!</li>
    <li> Takes longer than most mascara to apply because there are 2 steps but it lasts all day and waterproof with no smudging.</li>
    <li> As I have aged, my long eyelashes became shorter and sparse.  I started using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Lash Serum two months ago, and now my eyelashes are almost as long as they were when I was younger.  On a whim I bought this product to see if my lashes could be even longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not say this often:  This product does exactly what it claims to do.  I have been using this product now for a week, and it is the perfect accompaniment to the L\\&quot;Oreal Lash Serum.  My lashes went from being roughly half a centimeter without mascara to seven to eight millimeters.  With this mascara my eyelashes are close to nine millimeters.  This is no joke.  They look ridiculously long.  The waterproof formula is also decent enough.  While I do not think any company will make better waterproof mascara than Maybelline (which I used when I swam competitively for years), this mascara does a good enough job staying on.  My lower lashes are very long, and if I do not use waterproof mascara then I will develop black dots under my eyes from the ends of the lashes.  This mascara manages to stay on my lashes well, and if it does get wet it does not run.  It comes off well enough with mascara remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are aging and your lashes are becoming shorter, and you do not want to splurge for Latisse, I do recommend L&#x27;Oreal Lash Serum and this mascara.  The difference between now and two months ago is so extreme that I only wish I would have taken a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture to compare with this \\&quot;after.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Beware of this vendor - I ordered mascara and the products were so old they would be unsafe to use near the eye.  This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written but because I am a nurse, I did not want people to be using such outdated makeup.</li>
    <li> Love it, it works great gives even more length and fullness than i want. Will recommend this to anyone. Try it.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara!  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and no other mascara I&#x27;ve tried comes close to being as good as this one.  I even had a $30+ tube of some expensive French designer mascara once and it didn&#x27;t measure up to Double Extend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Double Extend lengthens and thickens eyelashes without looking messy (some thickening mascaras look sloppy).  I get compliments on my eyelashes while wearing Double Extend.  I really like that it comes in brown because I have very pale blonde eyelashes and medium blonde hair and black mascara can be a little too much for my coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boring details that you can skip reading:  just so you don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m hoity-toity for spending a ridiculous amount of money on French designer mascara, years ago when TSA enacted the liquids ban I had my Double Extend confiscated at the airport on the way to a business trip in Asia (this was before you could take a 1 quart bag of small liquids and I had managed to remember to check all my liquids but forgot my mascara); not knowing when I would have a chance to find mascara as I was on my way to Taiwan, arriving late in the day, and had a meeting early the next morning, I bought the only mascara I could find at the airport in Tokyo....and I was not impressed.  I think it was Chanel.</li>
    <li> When I received this mascara, it was dry and old. It was over a year expired. Do not buy from this seller!</li>
    <li> This has been my main mascara for many years now and it has never disappointed me. Sometimes I&#x27;ll try out other new mascaras (those ads make it look so promising!) but I&#x27;ve always ended up regretting it and going back to this one. It makes my puny lashes look full and long for the whole day and it NEVER smudges or smears or flakes. At the end of the day I either use a makeup remover or just a warm wet cloth to take it off. This is one of those mascaras that gets better as it gets older (a tip if you don&#x27;t know yet is to wipe the brush on a tissue the first couple times you use it so its not so wet - thus easier to layer on). This will continue to be a staple in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kind of mascara for several years.  It causes me no allergic reaction as most other brands do.  I have thin eyelashes and the white preliminary coat helps a lot to thicken my eyelashes and make them look fuller and longer. The waterproof aspect is great and keeps the color where it belongs on the eyelashes and not below your eyes.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time! My eyelashes are also hard to please!!</li>
    <li> Wow! What a difference.  I use an eyelash curler first and then apply the extender and then the mascara. I can&#x27;t believe the difference. My lashes are so much longer and thicker. This will be my new mascara for ever. I&#x27;m nearly 50yrs. old and my lashes are starting to thin.  This cured my problem :)</li>
    <li> I  have used this mascara for at least 10 years.  My lashes are white.  With both ends of L[Oreal Double Extend Mascara, i finally have lashesj!!  The mascara tube lasts longer than any other brand I have tried.  I have my daughter-in-law, and several friends now using it.</li>
    <li> I liked the extend mascara but the waterproof version tends to be dry from opening and get dryer making it flakier and difficult to use and it doesn&#x27;t last as long. I don&#x27;;t like black as well as the black brown because even though it&#x27;s waterproof, it smudges.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite mascara. It used to be so easy to find in all the drugstores, now that there are so many other &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; brands this one has gone by the wayside......glad for Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> It is really sad when you have to order your mascara on line because stores won&#x27;t stock brown !&lt;br /&gt;Why is it they assume there are no red heads or blonds out there who don&#x27;t want hooker eyes??&lt;br /&gt;There is something really wrong with Corp. America these days ...</li>
    <li> I am very upset that this mascara has been discontinued, as it is a terrific product, and was my favorite.</li>
    <li> WISH I COULD FIND THIS PRODUCT AGAIN,  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> My thin lashes look thick with this product. I would recommend it to all. Will certainly buy again. Need to be sure I buy black and not brown black next time.</li>
    <li> It just does the same effect as very expensive mascara, at a very reasonable price. The application is easy and it does not curdle.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge and stays on the lashes for a very long time (24 hours +). My favorite mascara. That&#x27;s what I call truly waterproof.</li>
    <li> Good product for my eye lashes.  Will buy more next time so I don&#x27;t run out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always found L&#x27;Oreal products to be good.</li>
