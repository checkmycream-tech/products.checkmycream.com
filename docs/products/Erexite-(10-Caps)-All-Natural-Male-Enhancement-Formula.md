      <li>and you ll be satisfied!!!</li>
      <li>- this is some great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A pleasant,warm, erotic feeling.</li>
      <li>To be fair, sildenafil did not even work on me, either.  </li>
      <li>A raging rocket on full throttle flew my wife into the clouds for over two hours!!!  </li>
      <li>as so many others have said OMG!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>This stuff is definitely amazing.  </li>
      <li>Holy mother of God, this stuff was even better than the famous \\&quot;V\\&quot; pill!  </li>
      <li>Not even sure if that had anything to do with product.  </li>
      <li>and my girl couldn&#x27;t be more happier.</li>
      <li>Most of the reviews are NOT verified purchases of EreXite.</li>
      <li>Or you might be able to get a sample and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
      <li>FOR ME this product did nothing but give me a headache and nothing more.</li>
      <li>However,He was able to perform like he did when he was in his twenty&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>I just ordered more.</li>
      <li>And like so many others, I got burned, even if I made sure to strictly follow the indications on the box...  </li>
      <li>I suspect that many of the \\&quot;fantastic\\&quot; reviews are from people representing this product, because I saw zero effects in the advertised area.</li>
      <li>bought it anyway here on Amazon.com - the 10 pack (just to make sure it worked) ...</li>
      <li>I was beginning to think the days of \\&quot;rock hard\\&quot; and more than once were gone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s very cool about it -</li>
      <li>One thing I do notice is that my energy level throughout the day is elevated and I seem to be more alert especially when a woman walks by lol.</li>
      <li>Two capsules worked on evening one, kept a residual medium strong residual effect on day two, and still held on on day three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if the positive reviews that were given to this product are in fact honest reviews or if they are being bought off.</li>
      <li>Well, like so many others I wanted to give those pills a try, just for the fun.  </li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;m going to the  doctor first just to be sure.</li>
      <li>This is no doubt the best thing out there, and to be honest, its not that expensive either.  </li>
      <li>I luckily got a 10 pack for free so no money was exchanged for this product.</li>
      <li>beforehand - the box says 45 minutes, but the full effect takes about an hour.</li>
      <li>But I noticed that most Amazon reviews are reasonably rational.</li>
      <li>just wanted to add that I also experienced headaches for a few days</li>
      <li>Well worth it.  </li>
      <li>ZILCH positive for me!</li>
      <li>I am 45 years old and in good health overall</li>
      <li>On the first try I made my wife come 3 times.</li>
      <li>, it really works so it is worth the discomfort</li>
      <li>This is my first review on Amazon</li>
      <li>I tried 2 the first day.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really turns on the \\&quot;male predatory sexual instinct\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>This product worked well for me, but I do notice a big difference if I take them on empty stomach in the morning with some hot tea they seem to work so so much more better.</li>
      <li>, that may not be that exciting or easy for me to maintain for a long time</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know how this item has had ANY positive reviews here but didn&#x27;t do NOTHING,</li>
      <li>Sometimes my wife needs me to hold a certain position, or rhythm</li>
      <li>I tried so many things before to stay harder longer.</li>
      <li>I really thought I was wasting my money - but</li>
      <li>So much hype these days -</li>
      <li>It really did make everything work like I was 18 again.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>/&gt;Simply put, it works with no side effects other than a slight (very light) sinus pressure (not unpleasant) a light buzz.</li>
      <li>Us guys want better erections and what not, but it&#x27;s not worth your life.</li>
      <li>For my wife - that&#x27;s probably her number one turn-on, seeing me turned on for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sides other than a burning urge to have sexual intercourse - and the effect lasts at least two days, so it can kind of interfere with concentration when you&#x27;re at work</li>
      <li>I am a healthy man with normal blood pressure, and less than an hour after taking this product (both times) I had throbbing headaches, which I never get.</li>
      <li>Expect spontaneous hard ones.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t normally bother</li>
      <li>After reading several positive reviews I decided to give EreXite a try.</li>
      <li>and it has lasted all day so far...</li>
      <li>pains difficulty breathing abd some heartburn,but it is worth it use one on an empty stomach</li>
      <li>Natural\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s completely safe.</li>
      <li>I also believe the positive reviews are bogus, to prove my point, look at the responses the negative reviews which IMO are true have garnered.</li>
      <li>Case in point is Yohimbe which was found to have serious side effects and is found in a lot of sexual enhancement supplements.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t make any nasty comments but I used one pill last night and this morning, we are both extremely happy :-)  </li>
      <li>One last piece of advice: for those of you who don&#x27;t know the \\&quot;trick\\&quot;, please don&#x27;t get fooled by the high score reviews left by people getting paid (or sometimes a rebate) to do so.  </li>
      <li>gave me intense non stop headache for 4 days seriously did not feel right.</li>
      <li>is that it seems to work both directly on your libido and also on the physical erection.  </li>
      <li>I got harder without this pills by eating the correct sex&#x27;s enhanced food like satay lamb, calm, beansprout, fresh egg, chocolate, peanut and ginger and also least twice a week exercise.</li>
      <li>It did give me a very slight headache for the first hour</li>

<li> It did give me a very slight headache for the first hour</li>
<li> He stayed erect for a long time, and had multiple climaxes.  </li>
<li> I highly recommend this product if you enjoy dull headaches behind the eyes.</li>
<li> but it was not a complete dud.</li>
<li> I read the ingredients to this stuff and thought o-k \\&quot;just another herbal crap pill\\&quot;, but it had good reviews, so I bought a pack.  </li>
<li> I tried Viagra, Cialis, and whatever the other drug is in a trial pack a couple of years back.</li>
<li> a day and a half later.</li>
<li> It did give me a four day, and counting, mild headache and random wood</li>
<li> I just wanted to last a little longer and try to reverse the effects of premature ejaculation.</li>
<li> Not much to notice with this pill.</li>
<li> Not what I expected after reading up on it</li>
<li> Produces erections which are much harder and stronger, and easier to keep.  </li>
<li> everything is empty marketing claims.</li>
<li> Its waste money, works only 5 minutes and make headache and breathing when i tried one.</li>
<li> days\\&quot; like some of the other reviews here, but hey, maybe it&#x27;s just me?</li>
<li> The effect seemed to be deluded if I take these pills when there&#x27;s food in my stomach, but I guess that would be the rule for any other type of herb or aspirin for that matter.</li>
<li> I may still consider this product based on the VERY few reviews that are actually verified purchases from Amazon.</li>
<li> but this had me rocking extra hard</li>
<li> Oh yeah, one pill will do (I later found out), but if you want that \\&quot;Holy crap, this thing is like a never ending stone pillar\\&quot; affect, two pills are fun to do.&lt;br</li>
<li> ....or it could give you a nasty headache that lasts several hours :)</li>
<li> What it did was give me a slight headache.  </li>
<li> and I m pretty crazy in bed</li>
<li> /&gt;To add on to that, take them a little over an hour</li>
<li> Waste of money...</li>
<li> Not only does this product not work for me, but I got terrible headaches and a very upset stomach for several days.  </li>
<li> What a waste of money this was.  </li>
<li> Waste of my money....</li>
<li> Again this product is a waste of money..</li>
<li> This was a waste of $40.00!</li>
<li> The thought of going the expensive medical route just to get a sample of one of the name brand chemical enhancers was not what I wanted to do.</li>
<li> Then when I tried my usual \\&quot;go to\\&quot; images</li>
<li> tremendously hard erections like in my 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> dont need to buy this crap. Its waste money, works only 5 minutes and make headache and breathing when i tried one. I got harder without this pills by eating the correct sex&#x27;s enhanced food like satay lamb, calm, beansprout, fresh egg, chocolate, peanut and ginger and also least twice a week exercise. May this help!</li>
    <li> I luckily got a 10 pack for free so no money was exchanged for this product. Which could possibly account for several reviews not being \\&quot;verified\\&quot; Amazon purchases. FOR ME this product did nothing but give me a headache and nothing more.Again, I say it didn&#x27;t work for ME (so Teddybear,who seems to be Erexites number one fan,lay off my review)&lt;br /&gt;I do suffer from ED so that may be the cause of the non-performance and this product makes no claims to correct ED, so if you don&#x27;t have ED this may work well for you.&lt;br /&gt;....or it could give you a nasty headache that lasts several hours :)</li>
    <li> This worked a litle I guess. Not what I expected after reading up on it but it was not a complete dud. So I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I tried Viagra, Cialis, and whatever the other drug is in a trial pack a couple of years back. They worked but are too expensive. I did not use anything since. I was hesitant on purchasing EreXite. But I noticed that most Amazon reviews are reasonably rational.So I gambled and tried a package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, it works with no side effects other than a slight (very light) sinus pressure (not unpleasant) a light buzz. Two capsules worked on evening one, kept a residual medium strong residual effect on day two, and still held on on day three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another occasion I used one capsule. Descent effect but (two days) not as definite. I will use two caps when needed.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money this was.  My girlfriend bought this for me and it does not work at all.  It was a total embarassment.  I dont think anyting related to this product is the truth.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! it does not work. gave me intense non stop headache for 4 days seriously did not feel right. stay away from this fake product, they don&#x27;t even have an official website.</li>
    <li> I tried so many things before to stay harder longer. This product is amazing. On the first try I made my wife come 3 times. Absolutely fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution. It stays in your system for over 20 hours. Expect spontaneous hard ones. Could be embarrassing.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of this stuff because it doesn&#x27;t seem to contain Yohimbine - and Yohimbine just seemed like something that a serious company would have thrown into this mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it anyway here on Amazon.com - the 10 pack (just to make sure it worked) ... and I have gone through that pack and bought another.  I really thought I was wasting my money - but nope - this is some great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s very cool about it - is that it seems to work both directly on your libido and also on the physical erection.  Libidowise, I pop two of these pills and about an hour later, I&#x27;m looking desperately for my wife!  Produces erections which are much harder and stronger, and easier to keep.  Sometimes my wife needs me to hold a certain position, or rhythm, that may not be that exciting or easy for me to maintain for a long time while she \\&quot;finishes\\&quot; ... but with this stuff ... when she says \\&quot;Don&#x27;t stop\\&quot; ... I can just keep going effortlessly at whatever I&#x27;m doing and I don&#x27;t have to concentrate on maintaining my erection for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produces almost painful erections ... tremendously hard erections like in my 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really turns on the \\&quot;male predatory sexual instinct\\&quot;.  When I get with my wife - I can only think of one thing and my respiration goes up and my wife can physically see how turned on to her I am by the way I look at her.  For my wife - that&#x27;s probably her number one turn-on, seeing me turned on for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sides other than a burning urge to have sexual intercourse - and the effect lasts at least two days, so it can kind of interfere with concentration when you&#x27;re at work but ... who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not work for everyone, but it does work for me!</li>
    <li> After reading several positive reviews I decided to give EreXite a try. Unfortunately the Erexite did not do anything -zilch- for me. I am 45 years old and in good health overall I just wanted to last a little longer and try to reverse the effects of premature ejaculation. This was a waste of $40.00! I gave a friend a couple to try out and he said to me he did not even get a hard on. I&#x27;m wondering if the positive reviews that were given to this product are in fact honest reviews or if they are being bought off. I tried two capsules and all I got was a headache from hell that lasted well to the next day. I feel like I was taken for a ride with erexite&#x27;s claims but they will not have my business ever again. For you guys that are reading this review I would think about it twice before trying this product. Or you might be able to get a sample and see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes: Sapper One</li>
    <li> This product worked well for me, but I do notice a big difference if I take them on empty stomach in the morning with some hot tea they seem to work so so much more better. The effect seemed to be deluded if I take these pills when there&#x27;s food in my stomach, but I guess that would be the rule for any other type of herb or aspirin for that matter. One thing I do notice is that my energy level throughout the day is elevated and I seem to be more alert especially when a woman walks by lol. I feel like a buck in heat at times during the day.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I ordered this.  But for me it did the trick.  It really did make everything work like I was 18 again.  This is my first review on Amazon and I don&#x27;t normally bother but I am very happy with this product.  It did give me a very slight headache for the first hour but then that went away.  I only took one pill and that was plenty.  The effect lasted about 48 hours for me.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product if you enjoy dull headaches behind the eyes. Otherwise, don&#x27;t bother. I am a healthy man with normal blood pressure, and less than an hour after taking this product (both times) I had throbbing headaches, which I never get. The second time, I chose to check my blood pressure, and it was 139 over 98. I suspect that many of the \\&quot;fantastic\\&quot; reviews are from people representing this product, because I saw zero effects in the advertised area. Disappointment. So much hype these days - everything is empty marketing claims.</li>
    <li> I purchased these pills here at Amazon, and when they arrived, I took one pill on Sunday night and then another pill on Wednesday night, and the effect was practically none at all. At $4 a pill I am very disappointed!</li>
    <li> 3 Reviews on the same day? (Feb 9th) Most of the reviews are NOT verified purchases of EreXite. Please, don&#x27;t be fooled by false reviews probably from people paid by the manufacturer to promote the product. Oh, and the packaging looks virtually the same as a product you can&#x27;t find on Amazon anymore called Letrevix. Name change maybe? Taking these types of pills without consulting your doctor can cause serious health problems. Just because it&#x27;s \\&quot;All Natural\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s completely safe. Case in point is Yohimbe which was found to have serious side effects and is found in a lot of sexual enhancement supplements. I may still consider this product based on the VERY few reviews that are actually verified purchases from Amazon. However, I&#x27;m going to the  doctor first just to be sure. Us guys want better erections and what not, but it&#x27;s not worth your life.</li>
    <li> I read the ingredients to this stuff and thought o-k \\&quot;just another herbal crap pill\\&quot;, but it had good reviews, so I bought a pack.  10 days later, I decided to take two just to try it out.  Holy mother of God, this stuff was even better than the famous \\&quot;V\\&quot; pill!  A raging rocket on full throttle flew my wife into the clouds for over two hours!!!  This is no doubt the best thing out there, and to be honest, its not that expensive either.  Well worth it.  Oh yeah, one pill will do (I later found out), but if you want that \\&quot;Holy crap, this thing is like a never ending stone pillar\\&quot; affect, two pills are fun to do.&lt;br /&gt;To add on to that, take them a little over an hour beforehand - the box says 45 minutes, but the full effect takes about an hour.</li>
    <li> I got the erexite for my husband with some reservations. However,He was able to perform like he did when he was in his twenty&#x27;s. (he is 54 and has had some difficulties in the bedroom lately) This stuff is definitely amazing.  He stayed erect for a long time, and had multiple climaxes.  It was wonderful!</li>
    <li> Did not work. Don&#x27;t know how this item has had ANY positive reviews here but didn&#x27;t do NOTHING, NADA, ZIP, ZILCH positive for me! Waste of my money....just wanted to add that I also experienced headaches for a few days, I will never try this stuff AGAIN. I also believe the positive reviews are bogus, to prove my point, look at the responses the negative reviews which IMO are true have garnered. FAKE! FAKE! FAKE!....And Amazon, why don&#x27;t you do something about \\&quot;teddybear\\&quot; attacking all non-positive reviews instead of deleting all reply&#x27;s to his review attacks!!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. It did give me a four day, and counting, mild headache and random wood a day and a half later. Not even sure if that had anything to do with product.  It did not deliver the punch I was looking for. Waste of money... Update as of 5/1/12. I gave my package to buddy to try out. He took 2 and also contracted a mind bending headache and no wood. Again this product is a waste of money..</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t make any nasty comments but I used one pill last night and this morning, we are both extremely happy :-)  I just ordered more.</li>
    <li> Not much to notice with this pill. I tried 2 the first day. It definately didn&#x27;t \\&quot;keep me up for 2 days\\&quot; like some of the other reviews here, but hey, maybe it&#x27;s just me?</li>
    <li> So I decided to try this pill out for the team.  And guess what? I took a pill and it did not work.  What it did was give me a slight headache.  To be fair, sildenafil did not even work on me, either.  NOT RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> Well, like so many others I wanted to give those pills a try, just for the fun.  And like so many others, I got burned, even if I made sure to strictly follow the indications on the box...  Not only does this product not work for me, but I got terrible headaches and a very upset stomach for several days.  So, what could I say?  That it still works for some people but not for me?  Maybe...  My money?  Don&#x27;t bother with this product.  One last piece of advice: for those of you who don&#x27;t know the \\&quot;trick\\&quot;, please don&#x27;t get fooled by the high score reviews left by people getting paid (or sometimes a rebate) to do so.  And it&#x27;s not just on Amazon by the way.</li>
    <li> Just got this product and all I got to say is whoaaa!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only took 1 pill since saturday(the day I got it in the mail 03/10/2012) and I m pretty crazy in bed but this had me rocking extra hard and my girl couldn&#x27;t be more happier. I also think the effect of this pill stays for couple days because today is Monday and get crazy hard when a female walks by. Take it from me buy it and you ll be satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> this product does work and works well but be prepared for some uncomfortable chest  pains difficulty breathing abd some heartburn,but it is worth it use one on an empty stomach, it really works so it is worth the discomfort</li>
    <li> Well, well, well ... I was indeed skeptical regarding the product&#x27;s claims. At 58 We&#x27;d noticed my youthful vigor was not what it once was. I was beginning to think the days of \\&quot;rock hard\\&quot; and more than once were gone. The thought of going the expensive medical route just to get a sample of one of the name brand chemical enhancers was not what I wanted to do. I read up on the Erexite product and decided to give it a try. It arrived yesterday and I tried it this morning ... as so many others have said OMG! It really works! It took about an hour for me to begin to feel something in my body. A pleasant,warm, erotic feeling. Then when I tried my usual \\&quot;go to\\&quot; images [guys know what that is], the result was dramatic ... just like when I was in my thirties again!... and it has lasted all day so far... I&#x27;m now a believer ... it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied customer.</li>
