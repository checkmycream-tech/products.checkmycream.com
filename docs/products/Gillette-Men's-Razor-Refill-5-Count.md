      <li>I love them blades.</li>
      <li>If I wanted a razor with 5 or more blades I&#x27;d still be using an electric.</li>
      <li>I am totally satisfied with the quality of shaving, and I can use one blade for months.</li>
      <li>When I run out, I will need more.  </li>
      <li>and I love having them delivered to my door</li>
      <li>However, with the steep cost of blades for newer razors, Sensor Excel may still be a more affordable option.     </li>
      <li>Always been my favorite.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is quite a rip off that these blades (and blades in general) getting more and more expensive. It is hard to get them at all. And ordering them in Germany instead of the US is almost half he price. Unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;I like the baldes. 2 Stars only for the rip off price.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, why the heck do I need three, for, five or even more blades in one. That seems stupid to me.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shaving system, I have ordered these blades before and re-ordered when I was close to running out, this is a good price and a good product.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years but they are getting hard to find anymore in my area but Amazon, as usual, had them.  DO NOT BUY the regular Gillette &amp;#34;Sensor&amp;#34; blades as they aren&#x27;t nearly as good and don&#x27;t last as long. Make sure you get the &amp;#34;Sensor Excel.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to replace the blades.&lt;br /&gt;Nice pack of blades for a somewhat decent price I guess.&lt;br /&gt;Order came as expected, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent packaging with no damage.</li>
    <li> Excellent packing as always.</li>
    <li> My son gets razor burn very easily and someone told him he needed to use a razor with only two blades. Difficult to find these days, but this one does the job very well.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Gillette Excel for about 10 years and they are great... They last long and are affordable.</li>
    <li> This dual-blade razor cartridge by Gillette is well made and durable. I have tried other brands but find the simple 2-blade design with the moisturizing strip to be a good deal and gives a great shave. I used to buy these at Costco but they now have moved up to some 3 or 4 blade product and no longer carry the Sensor Excel. But there&#x27;s no need to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot;, these work great! I&#x27;ve used for about 10 years now and wouldn&#x27;t trade them for any of the newer, fancier models with 3, 4, or 5 blades, no way!</li>
    <li> Costco and other vendors have stopped stocking Gillette Sensor Excel cartridges. Amazon&#x27;s supply if of quality and at good price. I wish they had the cartridges made in Gernay, the quality of which is better.</li>
    <li> Despite what the reviews say from 2009, the latest batch being sold and shipped from what appears to be Gillette, are garbage.  You can usually tell if you are getting gray market (blades that the company dumped because of poor manufacturing) or outright fakes, because the first shave with the blade feels like it is old and causes cuts.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t need a million blades to get a decent shave. Truth be told, you can get a really great shave with almost any razor and good quality shaving cream. I am hoping gillette doesn&#x27;t stop making these, as they are the only razor I can use without irritation.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find these razor blades the last time I went to the store. I hate the razors that offer three and even four blades, as I have no desire to cut my face the way those 3- and 4-bladers all but demand. So I took a look on Amazon, after finding it a good, cheap source for other products I normally buy at the store, and sure enough, here they were. So now I can use my two-blade razor again, instead of subjecting myself to all those cuts and abrasions.     I buy them on subscription, and save 15%, making a sweet deal even a little sweeter.</li>
    <li> Ok, in perspective this is a good razor.  You could say it is a hybrid trac II.  In my opinion, putting more blades on is a scam for you to buy more blades at a higher cost, keep in mind these are aluminium sharpened fine and coated for comfort, wrapped in plastic to attach at the head.    Multi blades are going to last longer, common sense should tell you though, to put another 1-2-3 more blades in a razor shouldn&#x27;t drive the cost up another $20.00 to $30.00.    So as not to get off track, this razor system is great, the regular blades provide a close shave, the handle is at such an angle you can see those hard to get to places such as nose, sides, jawline.    The sensor blades which are a little better, can provide a comfortable shave for people with more sensative skin, I find using barbasol with aloe or something comparable will give a close shave yet not have that burn afterward.    My shave routine consists of:    1.  cold water splash on the face, this tightens the pours of the skin and makes the whiskers stand up a little better.    2.  I use barbasol regular, it&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s foam, and it does the job.    3.  where you start is up to you, I usually start right to left going with the flow of the whiskers.  Never go against the grain as this will give you bumps (pseudofoliculitis barbae)and that can be a little uncomfortable or not look so good on that hot date or job interview.    4.  after I shave i jump in the shower, however, if you don&#x27;t always rinse.  This gets the cream off and any sediment such as left over whiskers and keeps them from entering skin pours and causing irritation, a big pimple or a serious infection.    5.  Now, this is optional and I would recommend this for guys starting to shave.  Try some after shave lotion, it soothes the skin so you don&#x27;t have that burn feeling all day, it also tightens the pours so you have a smooth shave longer and the girls appreciate a man that smells good and has a smooth face.    i hope this helps some of you, pick what works for you.    By the way gillette, I bet you are losing money on your blades, try lowering the prices for the everyday guy to afford to shave.</li>
    <li> The Gillette Sensor Excel is the second-generation razor from Gillette&#x27;s long-lived Sensor line. The Sensor Excel blades were the first among Gillette razors to add rubberized &#x27;microfins&#x27; at the bottom of the cartridges...a standard they have included on every Gillette produce since Excel&#x27;s debut. But with so many razors brought to market since its rollout, how does Sensor Excel stand up to competition today?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor Excel. It&#x27;s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Excel cartridges are noticeably smaller than, say, Mach 3 cartridges (about 1/3 smaller). The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than most razor systems today. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are very easy to shave as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave: 4.5 stars. One can tell that this truly was Gillette&#x27;s workhorse model for quite some time, and that a lot of research &amp; development went into the creation of this system. The Sensor Excel offers a comfortable shave with minimal drag, leaving the user feeling clean and smooth. As stated above, the blade angle and smaller cartridge design allows for easy precision shaving of sideburns and moustache/goatee areas--an ideal choice for men who maintain those types of facial hair. It is noteworthy that, as a person with sensitive skin, I felt no facial sensitivity after shaving with the Sensor Excel--something that I cannot say about newer razors such as Quattro and Fusion. For those with sensitive skin, this would perhaps be a wise choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability: 2.5 stars. This was where Sensor Excel disappointed me. I get, at most, three shaves out of one cartridge. Drag and other issues resulting from dull blades arose quickly after two to three shaves. It&#x27;s safe to say Sensor Excel has been surpassed by newer razors that have better blade coatings. By comparison, during my testing of the Gillette Fusion I got almost two weeks out of one cartridge. However, with the steep cost of blades for newer razors, Sensor Excel may still be a more affordable option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: A fine razor offering a no-frills kind of approach to shaving. No advertising or fancy marketing to deal with when it comes to Sensor Excel--just a razor that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, well. Durability comes into question here as newer razors offer better blade coatings, but still a smart choice for those who don&#x27;t buy into (and don&#x27;t need) the uber-bladed razor trend.

    <li> They are razor blades for a Gillette Sensor Excel. I like the old two blade sensor excel a lot more than the new mach 3/etc. They are less expensive and they are less prone to clogging up with your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sensor Excel ever since they came on the market.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of the others, and keep going back to them, getting the smoothest, closest shaves.  It seems that they will or already have discontinued the line, so I turned to Amazon to get them.  The order was accurate and came quickly.</li>
    <li> I first bought a Sensor after its roll-out at the 1991 Super Bowl.  I haven&#x27;t changed since, except for a few experimental purchases. Never cuts. Non-pivot blade give excellent control. Cleans well. Lasts a very long time without getting appreciably dull when kept clean.  Unlike Animal Farm...two blades good, more blades not better.</li>
    <li> All of the new razors have like 4,5 and 6 blades for a smoother shave, but they also can cut you much worse or give you a good nick.  I like the older 2 blade razors from Gillette, they give you a smooth shave and cost a lot less and last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> These blades just don&#x27;t last very long compared to those I used to buy even recently</li>
    <li> What can I say.  I had trouble finding these at a retail store.  I own the razor.  I found the cartridges on the web.  Don&#x27;t buy them.  When I run out, I will need more.  I really like them.  Great razor.</li>
    <li> I tried every new razor Gillette introduced over the years from Trac II, Trac II Plus, Atra, Sensor, et. al.  Each one was better than the previous one. However when they started with the 3 and 5 blades I said \\&quot;enough already\\&quot;.  I finally tried them as samples, but drew the line at the vibrating one.  The Sensor Excel is really the best. The problem is it got so expensive, in a large part because the 5 blade razors were hugely expensive and Gillette/P&amp;G couldn&#x27;t have an old product that worked so well so much cheaper.  At least with Amazon&#x27;s auto ship it makes the blades reasonable.  Perhaps the crowd at P&amp;G are responsible for these ridiculous new models out now with 6 blades (5 for the face and 1 for under the nose).  If the Sensor Excel is ever discontinued, I&#x27;ll have to try safety razor I guess.</li>
    <li> Mark the owner called me after receiving an email from me complaining of faulty blades. When was the last time the owner contacted you and tried their best to resolve an issue with an order. MG Electronics does customer service right.</li>
    <li> I used the Gillette Sensor 2 blade razor for years. Gives an excellent and as close a shave as possible but not easy on skin; left it chronically slightly rough. The 3 blade Mach 3 was as good but couldn&#x27;t shave under nose closely. The Gillette Fusion solved both problems. Shaves as close as the Sensor and has the single edge to shave under nose. And it is very easy on skin of face. The Fusion lasts a month shaving once a day; I&#x27;ve timed several blades. Try it.</li>
    <li> Hard to find the triple blade razor in stores.  So I use Amazon.  Works fine.  Try not to buy too much at one time as the humid climate just ruins the blades even in storage before I get them inserted in the razor.</li>
    <li> When I was growing up I would refer to less-expensive things as being &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; and my parents would always call me on it. Fair enough. &amp;#34;Cheaper&amp;#34; refers to a product that is qualitatively inferior. On that note I&#x27;ve tried a couple of less expensive or &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; alternative blades for (what is now) the basic 2 or 3-blade refill.  They&#x27;re cheap.  So I&#x27;ve resigned myself to just paying the man for the product. Maybe I&#x27;ll go with the razor blade at some point, but this is where I am now.</li>
    <li> The Sensor Excel blades were exactly what I ordered and expected.  They were delivered on time and in excellent condition.  I can highly recommend this vendor, and would do business with this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of Gillette razors over the last decade or so and the Sensor Excel remains my favorite. Though it neither possesses zillions of blades nor vibrates, it shaves closer than razors that do. Cartridges for it are also slightly cheaper than those for the Mach 3 or other high-end razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 5-count packages (bundled in packs of 2) are also a phenomenally good deal, especially if you purchase them using Amazon&#x27;s subscribe-and-save. My only complaint is that, in these bundles, the blue lubricating strip normally at the top of the razor has been replaced by a white and noticeably less lubricating version. Still, this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> These are the only blades my hubby will use</li>
    <li> I cancelled(or suspended) the 2nd shipment of blades. In spite of that you shipped them.  Shame on you. Great product!  Poor service.</li>
    <li> To sell what&#x27;s basically a commodity item at higher prices, razor manufacturers seem to be constantly adding shaving edges to their blade cartridges. Decades ago there was a TV ad parodying the escalation in the multiple-blade razor wars, with a funny animation showing what supposedly happened to each beard hair as the successive blade edges passed over it. The mock slogan: \\&quot;Because you&#x27;ll believe anything.\\&quot;   I got tired of paying for the 4-edge and 5-edge blades that now cost several dollars apiece. The simple double and triple blades are getting harder and harder to find, let alone at a reasonable price, so I was delighted to hear I could get them on a \\&quot;subscription\\&quot; basis from Amazon. The Gillette Sensor Excel blades arrived fast, and they work great. Additional blades will be mailed to me at regular intervals, and I can terminate the subscription at any time. Good deal!</li>
    <li> I had always liked the SensorExcel blades but the were a bit expensive.  A couple of years ago I started trying other brands that we less expensive. After going through several different brands I finally came back to the SensorExcel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end the SensorExcel are no more expensive than some of the others because I can use a single SensorExcel blade much longer than the others.  And, after switching back, I realize that the shave is much smoother with the SensorExcel blades.</li>
    <li> I just cant get into the razors with 3+ blades.  This razor keeps it simple and I hardly ever get razor burn.  Glad amazon carries them because many of my local retailers do not.</li>
    <li> I like the Proglide blades for general face area but they do not work well for sideburns and mustache area.  hence still buying the sensor excels for that purpose</li>
    <li> Have been a fan for ever and these blades are so much smoother than the new razors from Gillette.  Much better.</li>
    <li> yes they are the real thing stay sharp and last!!!!!!</li>
    <li> YOUR FIRST SHIPMENT CONTAINED ONLY ONE PACK,REPORTED IT AND SUBSEQUENT SHIPMENT CONTAINED 2 PACKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOHN MORELOCK</li>
    <li> These blades used to last a long time.  Now they start scraping in 5-10 uses and need to be replaced.  I think they really want everyone to upgrade to the fusion and for those who insist on using the old product they make it available but with poor quality.</li>
    <li> Only one pack arrived.</li>
    <li> Great works just like what u would purchase locally. Same great product you always expect from Gillette. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great Product these razors last a long time and the price beats all stores. Will be a return customer Thank You.</li>
    <li> too expensive for what you received</li>
    <li> I have used the Excel system for some time and the blades are consistently sharp, the shave quality is excellent, and I get at least one week&#x27;s worth out of each cartridge.  I have not tried the newer three and four blade systems, but I am not sure how much better the product could be.  Highly recommmended.</li>
    <li> Hard to find, great product. Have been using the Sensorexcel since it was first introduced many years ago. Have tried, but never got comfortable with the three (and more) blade razors. They make trimming around a mustache very difficult.</li>
    <li> Lets be honest here...Great blade. I can&#x27;t deny it. But check the prices...you&#x27;re not getting much in the way of materials here. I personally can&#x27;t use cheap disposable blades. I have to go over the area too many times. The razor clogs, and I always wind up breaking out (even as an adult).I like using a better made blade from Gillete. But I&#x27;m never going to run out and buy the latest and greatest with a bunch of blades in a row, vibrating components, etc. I just want a decent disposable blade that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. I truly won&#x27;t cave in and buy expensive blades often, I&#x27;ll be the guy who skip days of shaving to make expensive blades last. Give me a cost effective alternative, and I&#x27;ll shave everyday.</li>
    <li> Shopped in local stores and online and this, by far, was the &#x27;deal of the day&#x27;!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
    <li> If I wanted a razor with 5 or more blades I&#x27;d still be using an electric. This one works well, and feels better than the even older Trac II design. It&#x27;s just a shame these older blades have to be imported.</li>
    <li> This is where I  draw the line.  These blades are perfect for shaving, anything that came out after this - marketing hype.</li>
    <li> It does the job well: shaves cleanly without knicks.</li>
    <li> So happy to be able to get my husband&#x27;s favorite razors at a great price. Beats what I paid at Sam&#x27;s club and don&#x27;t have to buy such a large quantity at one time, not to mention the free shipping.</li>
    <li> too expensive go to sams or costco and get 50 razors for cost of one. very costly</li>
    <li> a bit expensive but easy to get thru Prime, easier than going to a store where they are all locked up and the hasstle of finding a clerk</li>
    <li> My husband has been using the Gillette Sensor Excel for many years. The cartridges we received from this seller must be some sort of counterfeit knock-off. The blades are so dull that my husband can&#x27;t even get one decent shave out of them. They also scratch his face when he tries to use them. Never had a problem with other refill cartridges in the past. Do not buy from this seller. Not worth it. If I could give these \\&quot;0\\&quot; stars I would.</li>
    <li> An oldie but goodie. I have resisted upgrading every year to more blades and more expensive options from Gillette and never regretted it. These blades are terrific</li>
    <li> Subscription pricing and availability are a hit; why be forced to get next generation blades at exorbitant pricing when Sensor blades are still available.</li>
    <li> Great Value I would have paid more for 5 blades. I will never by razor blades at the store again.</li>
    <li> Anyone that shaves knows that blades are way to expensive at the store. Buying these at Amazon helps out with the cost.</li>
    <li> I just switched to the genuine Gillette sensor excel blades after having used a knock-off for years. I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. Now I get a more comfortable shave and a cleaner face too. I won&#x27;t pay for all the metal in those four-bladed monsters. This is totally good. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it. I&#x27;m happy with these.</li>
    <li> A very smooth and clean shave. I am happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these older model cartridges from Amazon for a few years.  Work great and as long as they are available online, I plan on hanging on to my old razor</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything, and always reverted back to this brand. I have to agree to most of the reviews -two blades are more than enough. If you have sensitive skin, stick with this two blade razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using the sensor line of razors since high school. Im 42 now and using Sensor Excel. I will never use any other....If they stop making it well I guess I will grow a beard. I have tried all there products and the 4 or 5 more blades just skin me.. So Its going to be gone soon because im just seeing double paks in walmarts and nomore 5 count packs and there are 3 0r 4 rolls of the new products. Thanks Gillete for a great run and I really hope your not pushing this out of service...</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been using them for years. I love how close they shave and I love having them delivered to my door so I don&#x27;t have to think about it and I never run out.</li>
    <li> I do not get those umpteen blade razors.  I tried one once and found it irritated my skin worse than anything.  I assume it was the friction from all those blades grabbing my hair and skin.  Plus they are stupidly expensive.  While I would love to go the safety razor route like my father has used since the beginning of time, I know my hands are not the most steady early in the morning (darn near slashed my own throat with an Atra razor back in my younger days after too late a night).  And did I mention how stupidly expensive the umpteen blade razors are?  If you read my reviews, you know I am a tightwad, so anytime I can save on replacement blades, I&#x27;m sold.  Amazon offers the best price compared to local retail and the subscription service knocks more off the cost, with early notice of shipments so I can adjust shipping to my need.  As for the blades, not much else to say other than they work in the Sensor handle.  I wish I had kept my Atra handle, but I tossed it when I could not longer find the Atra cartridges in the stores and mistakenly assumed Atra was discontinued.  The Excel was close enough and Amazon&#x27;s subscription works.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> So it only has two blades.  You only have one face, right?  These five, six and seven-bladed razors are so last week.  I&#x27;ve used these two bladed razors for 30 years now and have never had reason to complain.  Not the same package mind you, I do change them twice a month.  My only concern is what I will do if my handle breaks since I&#x27;m not sure if they still make those today.</li>
    <li> I love the blades and thank God for free shipping.  Pricing could be better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a decade.  Recently, I tried switching to another product thinking it was time. However, it was a terrible experience. I went back to these and still a comfortable shave. I&#x27;ll probably stick with these as long as they make &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> i have tried all of the newer gilette razors with all of their blades and vibrating heads , but i still like the SENSOR the best of all .  i hope they don&#x27;t stop making replacement blades .</li>
    <li> I have used Sensor Excel blades for years and am pleased with them. I have resisted going to the newer models because I feel that more than two blades is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I love them blades. I have used them before I purchased from you.  My facial hair is very touch and one stroke across it with this blade makes my skin as smooth as a baby butt and that is very smooth.</li>
    <li> Came with a group order with the razor 3 pack. Was a little pricey with the razors, but it is hard to find since they are no longer in the stores.</li>
    <li> Same razor blade refills as you&#x27;d purchase in the store. Not as cost-effective as purchasing them from Costco (which doesn&#x27;t carry this particular one anymore), but more convenient as product is delivered to your door.</li>
    <li> good price and buy...compared it with a lot of places and they were the cheapest of the lot</li>
    <li> What can I say? I&#x27;ve been using these for over ten years.&lt;br /&gt;They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do for you.</li>
    <li> Only razors my husband can use.</li>
    <li> Ordered these on line as was having a hard time finding them @ local pharmacy(s).  They arrived lickity-split (ALMOST OVERNIGHT) -and - just in time for me as I was using an old blade!  The blades were new &amp; the SensorExcel is a great blade - been using &#x27;em for years &amp; they provide a slick shave.</li>
    <li> WHAT CAN I SAY? THESE A RAZOR BLADES. THESE BLADES WERE VERY HARD TO FIND. I COULD ONLY FIND THEM HERE. THEY ARE ORIGINAL.</li>
    <li> THE BLADES ARE WHAT I WANTED AND AS I DO NOT DRIVE ITCAME VIA MAIL I WILL BUY MORRE WHEN THESE HAVE BEEN USED UP</li>
    <li> I buy these for my hubby, he loves them and won&#x27;t use anything else.  He has pale, extremely sensitive skin so he is very picky about his shaving products.  This one doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin and he gets a nice close shave.  I like it because it smells nice.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using these razors for a long time. I don&#x27;t like the triple blades. Prices are the same as wal mart but with amazon I don&#x27;t have to make the trip. Will be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> I have used these razor blades before and found them to be long-lasting and to work very well. Will definitely buy them again.</li>
    <li> Really unhappy about the durability of these blades. There are better alternatives out there for a lower price. Look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> They might be &amp;#34;old,&amp;#34; but I like these still since they are thin and allows me to go below my nose with ease.  The 4+ type blades with the floating/spring-like motion are not as precise on smaller areas like around the mouth and nose.</li>
    <li> Not quite sure why razor double blades are so expensive, but I&#x27;ve been buying these for years and they work the best. For me, three blades don&#x27;t navigate well.</li>
    <li> They look real, but they don&#x27;t feel the same on the face, and they don&#x27;t last as long as those I&#x27;ve purchased in stores.  I&#x27;m thinking these are very cleverly packaged knock offs.</li>
    <li> Personally I think it&#x27;s dumb to use more than two blades on your mug.  These work really well.  NOW, to keep them sharp here&#x27;s what you need to do.  After each use,  Dry them off then blow down in there and try and make it fairly dry.. or they WILL rust.&lt;br /&gt;Next, grab a pair of jeans and stroke them 10 times.  I guarantee it will not only sharpen them nicely, but it will make the last and last.  Good idea for someone that needs to know this.</li>
    <li> I bought these razor blades in the hopes of finding an inexpensive alternative to the bulky and pricey options currently on the market. I liked the small size and the cheap replacement cartridges. But I was disappointed. The razor is notably rougher on my face than my Schick Quattro - especially if I have skipped a day of shaving. This razor has been banished to the bathroom storage drawer where it will stay until I have time to donate it to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> Always been my favorite. Face,  chest, shoulders, neck.. does a great job! Square chin,  coarse hair? No problem. The two blades are perfect. Anymore is too much.</li>
    <li> The cartridges easily snap in and out of the handle (sold separately) without actually touching the cartridges. Also gives a close clean shave.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product since Costco no longer carries it.  I was happy to find it for a good price, however, the blades are going dull after a couple of shaves.  At this rate, I would go thru 2 blades a week.  Not really worth it, even at this low price.</li>
    <li> Great blades, hard to find in stores. These blades were issued by Gillette many years ago, and despite trying a few replacements, I prefer the Sensor Excel blades. I get them sent to me from Amazon using its subscribe and save program. The reason I like these blades is I don&#x27;t get cut on the chin and under the nose like I do with many of the newer multiple blade razors currently being sold. I usually get a week of shaves from a single blade but to achieve that level, one must ensure the blade is bone dry before putting it in the drawer. Otherwise, usage drops by 50% or so. I use a can of compressed air to dry the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I would prefer an electric razor but I have never found one the comes even close to a real blade. So until they make such an electric shaver, I will use the Sensor Excel blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, July 2016. Amazon no longer sells these in its &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; program. Amazon tried to have me switch to the cheaper and less effective razor, the Gillette Sensor, which is not the same as the Gillette Sensor Excel. I passed on the offer and will probably just get blades at Target or maybe Walgreens.</li>
    <li> They fit and shave clean, but not really much better than disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The date on the box says copyright 2000, so I wonder if they are either a Chinese counterfeit, have been in stock for a decade, or maybe Gillette never updated the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fit, shave, and were cheap, so for many that&#x27;s good enough.</li>
    <li> Gillette sensor blades are great little pricey but they shave very well and using a good shaving soap and brush like my G.Father used to use the blades last long time and many shaves</li>
    <li> The Gillette Sensor Excel is a good razor at a great deal. Try buying a five pack at a grocery store and be prepared to pay around $15.  One ten pack lasts me around a month.</li>
    <li> Love the idea of buying razors via Amazon - super simple.  Have been using the SensorExcel for as long as I can remember, but have never bought them via Amazon until now.  Used a blade for the first time today and emerged with seven cuts on my face - can&#x27;t remember a new Gillette blade cutting me even once in the past.  Don&#x27;t know if these are counterfeits or low grade blades, but these are not up to normal standards.</li>
    <li> I have been loyal to the SensorExcel brand for around 10 years.  My routine, as I&#x27;ve done for years.  Hot shower, facial scrub, Kiehl&#x27;s shaving cream... shave.  Toner, moisturize.  Rinse razor, dry with towel, store.  Lately I&#x27;m finding that the quality of these SensorExcel replacements cartridges has really gone downhill.  I would stop short of calling these &#x27;fake&#x27; as some other reviewers have suggested, but I think Gillette has cheapened the quality and durability of these blades.  After a maximum of 3 uses, these blades start to nick against the skin and gloss over or miss parts of hairs entirely.  Since I shave every 2-3 days, one of these replacement cartridges last about a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last couple purchases of these through Amazon have really left me disappointed.  Recently, my mom gave me a 20-pack of those cheapo Costco razors.  While not as smooth as the SensorExcel, each of them lasted 5+ uses without missing patches of hair or pulling too much against the skin.  I&#x27;m rethinking my loyalty to this brand and will probably look elsewhere when this replacement cycle runs out.</li>
    <li> one of the best blades</li>
    <li> GOOD VALUE, WHY ARE THESE SO EXPENSIVE?</li>
    <li> Been using the sensor excel razors for years.  They work well and are gentle on the skin.  It is more cost effective to purchase off of Amazon than at a local store.</li>
    <li> These are excellant razor blades, not available at local stores. The sensor excell blades are superior to the regular sensor Blades, will last 3-4 months before change is needed, great razor blade.</li>
    <li> Some reviews claim the quality of these have gone down, but these seem just as durable as any I&#x27;ve purchased here. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this older style razor and blades because they are great for close shaving near my nose and eyebrows and exact shave on my sideburns. I can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore...gotta love the</li>
    <li> The picture shows 1 Sensor 3 blade and 4 Sensor Excel blades but you actually receive 5 Sensor Excel blades.</li>
    <li> Still my favorite razor and blades. Expensive though. Will these ever cost less?</li>
    <li> I have a very light beard.  I don&#x27;t need cartridges with 3, 4, 5 blades.  I&#x27;ve been happy with Sensor for 15 years and I hate that it&#x27;s getting hard to obtain.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get these at the supermarket, nor CVS, WalMart, Target. Have to start ordering these on line. Came quickly. Anything with more than two blades is only an expensive marketing ploy. FIVE blades??? Really??? Twin blades are enough. Three, and you&#x27;re better off getting an electric razor (which I can&#x27;t use due to getting ingrown hairs on the neck). Four or five blades? BS.</li>
    <li> Good blades but expensive.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different types of razors, but I just keep coming back to this one.  It just works the best for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not ready to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to the newer 3, 4 and 5 blade razors!  Twin blades work just fine for me, so I plan to keep using the Sensor Excel razor and cartridges as long as they&#x27;re available.</li>
    <li> This is a Nice Product. This product is, as described in adv and does as it is said in adv.</li>
    <li> The blades are exactly as advertised.  Not a tremendous savings vs purchasing at the grocery store, but obviously more convenient.</li>
    <li> I only need two blades to shave and trim my full beard.  I don&#x27;t believe a man (or woman) needs three, four or five blades to get a good shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure the source of these razors (I discarded the boxes before I used them) but the first one out of the package was dull. I have ordered from Amazon for the past few years and have never received razors as dull as these are. I suspect they are fakes (made in China?) and I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite type of cartridge and I&#x27;ve tried many.  Pro Tip: If you store your razor in a covered glass with some rubbing alcohol in the bottom it will keep the blade sharp for 3x longer.  Saves a lot of money over time.  The glass needs to stay covered or the alcohol will evaporate in a day or two.</li>
    <li> good for pleasant shaving</li>
    <li> They seem to be less effective. Has the company changed anything in the production process?</li>
    <li> The reason why I choose Gillette is that I trust this brand and the quality of its produts, but this cartridges have given me a lot of trouble since I started using them. Everytime I use it to shave, I need to be VERY careful, cause if I am not, it is very likey that there will be a wound on my face. Even though I have tried my best to be concentrated and careful while shaving, I am wounded several times. I trust Gillette, but have on idea what is the problem with this package of cartridges.</li>
    <li> I like this razor and would not use anything else. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a really clean shave.</li>
    <li> Before long, there is little doubt we will have an 8 bladed shaving razor.  When will the madness end?  The Gillette Sensor Excel has been my favorite razor for over a decade, and will be sad when the stocks finally run out.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for years and now it is getting more difficult to find in the stores.  It is such a shame that razor blades have increased in price so much over the past several years.  Buying this product at Amazon has been a good find.</li>
    <li> This shaver didn&#x27;t give me any knicks. I&#x27;ll be using this a lot more now! Also cheaper on here compared to other stores.</li>
    <li> Great product, I always buy this, and it arrives so quickly.  Thanks. The price is good too, and they last long.</li>
    <li> This two bladed Gillette SensorExcel cartridge is by far the best of the blades on the market. The product has a lubricating strip and rubber strip to &#x27;set up&#x27; the beard stubble. When used daily with a lanolin shaving cream and by drying out the razor after each use, I can easily get 3 months of daily shaves from a single cartridge. This is a product that delivers a clean shave without the marketing hype of 3,4,5, and 6 bladed products.</li>
    <li> Sharp and perfect.  Can&#x27;t hardly find in a store anymore where i live.  Why drive around looking wasting gas.&lt;br /&gt;Just order these.  They are the real ones.  Tried other multi-blade combos, nothing matches the Sensorexcel.</li>
    <li> I’ve used these blades for a few years and find them to be very effective and pretty long-lasting. I only have to shave 2-3 times per week and now that I dry the blades after shaving, each blade lasts for at least 4 months before I need to change it (i.e. it nicks me). Look up “extending life of razor blades” to get the story – companies like Gillette have no interest in telling you how to make their blades last longer, but it’s pretty simple; the key is to avoid the oxidation (rusting) that occurs through contact with water. What I do: after shaving, rinse the blade briefly with warm water to remove all remaining soap and hair, then shake off the water and the briefly blot on a towel. The warm water will evaporate off the warm blade pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two-blade cartridges give a close-enough shave that I can’t imagine how adding an extra two or three blades to each cartridge could help improve the shave. I’ve tried the Schick Quattro and they were no better than the Sensor Excel blades. Like other reviewers I think these blades are as advanced as razors need to be, the extra blades and features are more for marketing purposes – you don’t need any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slate magazine has an article on comparing the carbon footprint of disposable razors versus an electric shaver. Their conclusion is that the energy used to heat the water is the largest carbon cost when shaving with disposable razors and that therefore electric razors win (but that either way the carbon cost is not that high). Their assessment doesn’t factor in the material waste of broken electric razors, and landfill waste is arguably a bigger issue when comparing the options. Disposables have a high landfill impact also (2 billion disposable razors are dumped each year in the US) so make your blades last as long as possible. I figure that if I use only 15 disposable blades over 5 years, then this may have a lower material cost than a single electric razor. Using recyclable Preserve razors will help too (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I’m going to try out the Preserve razors next – partly because I like to support their company (I use their toothbrushes and also recycle my #5 plastic at their Gimme5 recycling centers at Whole Foods). They have done a lot to promote recycling #5 plastic and their razors handles are made with recycled (and recyclable) plastic. Having said that, you don’t need to buy another razor handle if you want to switch to Preserve since their replacement blades will work on the Gillette handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason for switching to Preserve is that the company does no animal testing, while Gillette have had long battles with PETA over their animal testing and, although the Gillette razors don’t involve animal testing (to my knowledge), the company is owned by P&amp;G which still does some animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I’ll give the Sensor Excel blades 5/5 gold stars for quality of the product (because they really are good blades) and 2/5 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing them. They lose 1.5 green stars because Gillette make little effort to conserve materials compared to a company like Preserve (the hard plastic case housing the blades is unnecessary; nothing is recycled or recyclable) and lose another 1.5 green stars because of Gillette’s and P&amp;G’s poor track record on animal testing.clable Preserve razors will help too (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I’m going to try out the Preserve razors next – partly because I like to support their company (I use their toothbrushes and also recycle my #5 plastic at their Gimme5 recycling centers at Whole Foods).

They lose 1.5 green stars because Gillette make little effort to conserve materials compared to a company like Preserve (the hard plastic case housing the blades is unnecessary; nothing is recycled or recyclable) and lose another 1.5 green stars because of Gillette’s and P&amp;G’s poor track record on animal testing.</li>
    <li> I have a very expensive shaving set; my wife gave it to me, as a gift, many years ago. The razor takes only Gillette Excel blades. Even though there are many new models of razors on the market, I keep on using the old one. I am totally satisfied with the quality of shaving, and I can use one blade for months.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for over 30 years. I started off wet shaving with an old I have NEVER received a better shave with any cartridge - whether 2, 3, 4 or the 5 bladed monstrosities out there! And I am not going to pay $2-$5 per freaking cart! I only used these cartridges only for the back of my neck at the hair line and for manscaping down south. Now, I simply gave up on &#x27;carts&#x27; and use my safety razor for those areas as well and you know what....it works even better! No ingrown hairs or razor rash issues. I would never give up buying quality blades and using a double sided safety razor (the Merkur 34C..cough,cough)...which gives you a better shave any way! My girlfriend wet shaves after I taught her and she will never go back to cartridges either...her words, not mine. She uses a Merkur 23C and loves it.  If you absolutely MUST shave with cartridges, in my opinion, the simple, reliable Gillette Sensor Excel is an excellent choice.  Honestly, for the sake of caring about the environment, we all should go back to safety razors that use blades and stop wasting resources like razor carts!</li>
    <li> I order these every 6 months through Amazon subscription: cheapest SensorExcel on the market.&lt;br /&gt;They work well according to my husband so I will keep buying them for sure.</li>
    <li> Will buy again if the price stays lower than the grocery store&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> CAN&#x27;T STOP USING THESE FAITHFUL BLADES OF LONG TIME AGO. LIGHT WEIGHT AND GREAT SHAVE. HOPE THEY KEEP MAKING THEM.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other blades.  These work the best.  They stay sharp and don&#x27;t clog up and give you a good shape.  What more do you need?</li>
    <li> These are not sharp, knock offs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor since it came out at the start of the blade wars.  The blades are great quality, last a long time and have held up to travels around the world.  Whenever I find a deal I stock up.  Great blades!</li>
    <li> Been shaving for 70 years, tried many razors, from blue blades to Rolls to Wilkinson, this is the best ever.</li>
    <li> My favorite razor blades.  Wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive though.</li>
    <li> And the price and service of subscribe and save. I think this was the last innovation required in the shaving blade world. Anything after this is more gimmick, and actually very rough on my skin (I&#x27;ve tried, but decided to settle on this one).</li>
    <li> I bought this because my electric and 5-blades irritated my skin too much; these are the perfect mix of functionality but also comfort.</li>
    <li> I finally broke down and bought replacement blades for my razor after years of using disposables. I have been pleased with the transition although they have not remained sharp for as long as some customers stated in their reviews. The blade was sharp for a good month; the second month it was ok. -then it&#x27;s time for a new one. One customer said they used their blade for 4 months; I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible if you have to shave everyday like I do. But these are good blades and I would recommend them.</li>
