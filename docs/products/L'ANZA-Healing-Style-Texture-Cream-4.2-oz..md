### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The stylist who introduced me to it moved to another state - I am so happy to find this product on Amazon!</li>

      <li>it is awesome!</li>
      <li>Great volume all day!</li>
      <li>This is the best.</li>
      <li>It holds them great without feeling weighted.  </li>
      <li>product works great with just a dime size, it gives my hair body</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair and this does a good job of taming it.</li>
      <li>Been using this over a year and haven&#x27;t had anything but good results.</li>
      <li>This product works perfectly to eliminate frizz and flyaways, and really brings out the wave in my hair.</li>
      <li>but it is not sticky and washes off hands very easily.</li>
      <li>love love love this product!</li>
      <li>so I am grateful to be able to order from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Have used it for years and love it</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad she did.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many others.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy and have this product for a long time.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and like the holding power.  </li>
      <li>and I love it because it&#x27;s not sticky or too radical but my permed hair stays curly way longer than it should with soft curls.</li>
      <li>I have very straight hair that flops in humidity</li>
      <li>I know, for sure, that not all products work for each individual.</li>
      <li>I works the same, though, I guess, until I find something more affordable.</li>
      <li>Love this for short hair.  </li>
      <li>The first time I went to use it</li>
      <li>This product is very good and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>It is the only product I have used that works wonderfully on my  fine hair.</li>
      <li>Too much would probably give you a sticky feeling.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I used too much</li>
      <li>SHE IS REALLY PICKY</li>
      <li>I personally prefer the Short &amp; Sexy products to this.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t even tell that I have product in my hair when I use this stuff, and my hair is so fine that conditioner weighs it down.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products and keep coming back to this one.</li>
      <li>Some days, I try not using it to see if it&#x27;s really doing anything, and my hair is definitely flatter and a bit unruly when I go without.</li>
      <li>make sure that you only use a small amount, and wipe off the spout every so often</li>

    <li> I have thin blonde hair but a lot of it, and my hair has a natural wave. This product works perfectly to eliminate frizz and flyaways, and really brings out the wave in my hair. My hair stylist introduced me to it and I&#x27;m so glad she did.  I&#x27;ve tried many other products and keep coming back to this one. The product is a thick lotion that almost resembles a gel in sheen but it is not sticky and washes off hands very easily. It doesn&#x27;t make hair feel crunchy or sticky either. I put some in my palm and rub to emulsify it - it works the best this way.</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair that flops in humidity&lt;br /&gt;This product works great with just a dime size, it gives my hair body</li>
    <li> This product is very good and a little bit goes a long way.  I have some now and would purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Great volume all day!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER. GOT HER SOME AT CHRISTMAS SO THIS IS THE SECOND ORDER. SHE IS REALLY PICKY BUT SHE LOVES THIS.</li>
    <li> This is a product I had used before but could not find in the stores.  I have fine hair and like the holding power.  But just use a little, otherwise, it&#x27;ll be sticky.</li>
    <li> Totally different color in fact, and less than half the size. I works the same, though, I guess, until I find something more affordable.</li>
    <li> I have been using for years.  It is the only product I have used that works wonderfully on my  fine hair.</li>
    <li> love love love this product! The stylist who introduced me to it moved to another state - I am so happy to find this product on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I know, for sure, that not all products work for each individual. I have a lot of hair and this does a good job of taming it. I have used it for over a year. Would not be without it.</li>
    <li> I use this for \\&quot;lift\\&quot; to my bangs.  It holds them great without feeling weighted.  You only need a very small amount - dime size - in the palm of your hand, rub into wet hair, and blow dry.  A little really goes a long way.  Too much would probably give you a sticky feeling.  Been using this over a year and haven&#x27;t had anything but good results.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this product from the salon but this time I ordered it online to save a little money.  The first time I went to use it I noticed it was a different color than usual and also had a strange smell to it.  Therefore, I threw it away and won&#x27;t order online ever again...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell that I have product in my hair when I use this stuff, and my hair is so fine that conditioner weighs it down. Some days, I try not using it to see if it&#x27;s really doing anything, and my hair is definitely flatter and a bit unruly when I go without. The shape holds all day, but doesn&#x27;t get stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure that you only use a small amount, and wipe off the spout every so often so you don&#x27;t end up with a gel ball in your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and I love it because it&#x27;s not sticky or too radical but my permed hair stays curly way longer than it should with soft curls. I can no longer seem to find it in the stores so I am grateful to be able to order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using polyester for a few years now and it tames my curls and shapes them. I like to mix it with a little clear hair serum and then apply to my  wet curls...it is awesome!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before but for me I find it to be too sticky and stiff.  If you have short spiky hair then you might find this to work well for you.  I personally prefer the Short &amp; Sexy products to this.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and love it</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product gives my hair body without making it stiff.  Some products appear to be greasy, not this.  I&#x27;m very happy and have this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how the product will work but &amp;#34;love our lines beauty&amp;#34; who was selling it sent me 2 container.  The bottles were scratched up and dirty inside the bubble wrap and they had scotch tape covering the cap.  They looked nasty.</li>
    <li> They must have changed the formula for this product.  I&#x27;ve purchased it before and this time I was disappointed by it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> Love this for short hair.  I hate sticky hair &amp; this is not.  Buy in salon or online.  I have tried so many others.  This is the best.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for another Lanza product that they discontinued. This just doesn&#x27;t work for me, though. I&#x27;ll have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this product.  Made my hair feel lifeless.  Maybe I used too much</li>
