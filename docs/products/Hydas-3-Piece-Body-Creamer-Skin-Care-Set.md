      <li>Love this one.</li>
      <li>great design, very practical</li>
      <li>One of the better ones</li>
      <li>this is wonderful for back legs and feet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks and found that it spreads lotion (Jergens, in my case) better than can be done by hand.</li>
      <li>This seems to be a much better alternative to the cheaper ones.</li>
      <li>I love that I can now apply lotion to my arms and legs without getting my hands all covered.</li>
      <li>It is much more sturdy than the others &amp;#34;like seen on TV&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>wish the balls turned more easily to dispense the lotion.</li>
      <li>This is probably because it is very full with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Easy to handle.</li>
      <li>It helps that it can be taken apart easily for travel.</li>
      <li>Easy to carry it with you too.</li>
      <li>I used it with a moisturizing lotion and it seemed to spread the lotion fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for applying the gel (benadryl in my case) to your back.  </li>
      <li>Smooth application.</li>
      <li>Great product for putting on lotion on your back, husband loves it</li>
      <li>great for putting lotion on your back!</li>
      <li>Great way to cream back.</li>
      <li>works great however don&#x27;t screw the cap on too tight as it cracks very easily</li>
      <li>a well made product that does exactly what it describes it can do!!</li>
      <li>This is, by far, the best; the lotion comes out smoothly and evenly, and it&#x27;s easy to reach every part of my back.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love it ;-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and it works great.</li>
      <li>like the application head so much, I might buy it separately and keep it in the car during the summer when periodic light applications on the arms and legs are needed without glops.</li>
      <li>Always applies just the right amount of lotion as the balls stop rolling when they it already lotioned skin.</li>
      <li>This device, however, delivers just the right amount.</li>
      <li>Just put the lotion inside, secure the cap and it reaches a lot of spots you normally couldn&#x27;t do by yourself.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to get lotion on my back, and it feels good too with the little ball things</li>
      <li>This provides a light, consistent coating and even a bit of massage action!</li>
      <li>This really works!</li>
      <li>I put most of it back together</li>
      <li>Better than others (different brands)</li>
      <li>This works better than any similar item I&#x27;ve tried yet.  </li>
      <li>The last one of these I had (Hydas Euro body creamers) lasted me about 2 years, the weight is good enough so the rollers have contact with your skin without you having to push with your arm up over your head, and the roller surface is nice and large making it easier to get your whole back.</li>
      <li>Can put lotion on my back without any problems, and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and covers all of the spots on my back that I can no longer reach.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>Better than I expected</li>
      <li>You do need to use very runny lotion.  </li>
      <li>works really well</li>
      <li>Much sturdier and the balls are tighter so they don&#x27;t pop out nor do they let too much lotion out.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I can finally moisturize my own back.</li>
      <li>frankly don&#x27;t know if any other products would fare better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also quite pleased that it comes with a lid so other things don&#x27;t get covered in lotion and</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s helpful and easy to use with my limited reach.</li>
      <li>I have had several different brands, some working better than others.</li>
      <li>I like it but the cream I use was kind of thick</li>
      <li>I used Cetaphil daily lotion, and it was just right.</li>
      <li>so it,easy to use, I live alone</li>
      <li>I live alone and have always needed something like this.</li>
      <li>and I really like having a way to reach my whole back</li>
      <li>What a relief to finally be able to get lotion on those hard to reach spots all by myself.</li>
      <li>much smoother action, solid construction.</li>
      <li>A handful of the balls fell out, one of which collapsed completely.  </li>
      <li>Unlike the lotion applicator that I purchased last month, This one works very well.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this one above all the others on this sight, it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>This is probably fine for lotions but for cream, it is not very effective.</li>
      <li>Not a good product very cheap soap does not come through</li>
      <li>Better made than the last one I purchased a few years back.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This applicator turned out to be much easier to use than I expected.</li>
    <li> I like it but the cream I use was kind of thick and the balls don&#x27;t roll out enough. I need to put some cream on the outside of the balls to get enough on my back without taking forever. Otherwise it has worked out well and I really like having a way to reach my whole back</li>
    <li> I love that I can now apply lotion to my arms and legs without getting my hands all covered. I like to read while doing this and I no longer have to worry about moist, greasy fingers. I haven&#x27;t even attached the handle yet. I&#x27;m also quite pleased that it comes with a lid so other things don&#x27;t get covered in lotion and the lotion inside doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
    <li> Great way to cream back.</li>
    <li> just love so it,easy to use, I live alone and they wanted me put moisturizer cream on my back which was very hard to do, it was so easy with this plus it massage my back while putting it on. Easy to carry it with you too.</li>
    <li> Always applies just the right amount of lotion as the balls stop rolling when they it already lotioned skin. I also thought the unit would start to get messy with lotion around the balls, but after at least a months of use it still looks really clean. Solid construction and well built too.</li>
    <li> Great product for putting on lotion on your back, husband loves it</li>
    <li> Miracle!  Can put lotion on my back without any problems, and it&#x27;s so easy to use. You do need to use very runny lotion.  I used Cetaphil daily lotion, and it was just right.</li>
    <li> i can moisturize my back ( gets itchy) without bothering my husband to do it! A+</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! It is very easy to get lotion on my back, and it feels good too with the little ball things</li>
    <li> Bought this for my dad and he hasn&#x27;t broken it yet so I count that as a win.</li>
    <li> It works as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> This seems to be a much better alternative to the cheaper ones. much smoother action, solid construction. So far so good!</li>
    <li> I can finally moisturize my own back. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and it works great.</li>
    <li> This is the best body creamer I have used.  It is easy to use and covers all of the spots on my back that I can no longer reach.  It helps that it can be taken apart easily for travel.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected</li>
    <li> Would prefer heavier lotion application.</li>
    <li> Works great, buying two more for gifts!!</li>
    <li> Awesome, nice quality</li>
    <li> This is amazing!  I live alone and have always needed something like this. It works better then I could ever have imagined!</li>
    <li> Great cream applicator for those who can&#x27;t reach  every spot on their backs. The only way to tackle the winter itches.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully...a well made product that does exactly what it describes it can do!!</li>
    <li> After a surgery I have given to my Mom so she could reach her feet with lotion. Works great.</li>
    <li> Not a good product very cheap soap does not come through</li>
    <li> I bought it for a gift and have had a good report. The recipient said, &amp;#34;The more lotion you use, the better it works.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works great with coconut or almond oil.  Not so good with a lotion</li>
    <li> wish the balls turned more easily to dispense the lotion.</li>
    <li> great for putting lotion on your back!</li>
    <li> Better made than the last one I purchased a few years back. Stronger handle. Made in Germany. There you go!</li>
    <li> This works better than any similar item I&#x27;ve tried yet.  Just put the lotion inside, secure the cap and it reaches a lot of spots you normally couldn&#x27;t do by yourself.  I like it.</li>
    <li> One of the better ones</li>
    <li> Love this one. It is much more sturdy than the others &amp;#34;like seen on TV&amp;#34;.  So glad I bought this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for applying the gel (benadryl in my case) to your back.  Awesome, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is in storage - the liquid leaks if fyou hang it up or set it face down.  This means that yoy need to store it on its back in a drawer or shelf, and this could be  a problem for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it ;-)</li>
    <li> Just had back surgery and can not bend. this is wonderful for back legs and feet.</li>
    <li> Is helpful aftr I get out of the pool.</li>
    <li> great product and applies cream very well and evenly</li>
    <li> works great!!! You just need to use lotion not thick cream and give it a little shake before rolling it.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my sister who has skin issues and she says it&#x27;s the best gift I&#x27;ve given her in ten years.  Handle snaps in easily and stays in place firmly (had issues with this with previous items from other companies).  Covers evenly and reaches all the tough spots.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Works great I even use it to do my legs, arms, just easier to use</li>
    <li> terrible product-- the head often pops off spraying cream everywhere</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these lotion applicators. The one with a wooden handle is just to light making it difficult to get the lotion where you want it, the other one with rollers broke within a month.  The last one of these I had (Hydas Euro body creamers) lasted me about 2 years, the weight is good enough so the rollers have contact with your skin without you having to push with your arm up over your head, and the roller surface is nice and large making it easier to get your whole back. The only thing different is the last time I bought this it came with 2 roller ball heads. I would definitely recommend this one above all the others on this sight, it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> If I could give this product six or seven stars, I would.  We&#x27;d been looking around for something like this for a while.  Others we saw had washable or replaceable fabric pads to take the oil or lotion.  This thing has 17-18 plastic ball bearings that dip into whatever you stuff into the reservoir.  Needless to say, you cannot use a really thick lotion with this -- gotta keep it light -- something that will flow.  We recently shifted over to baby oil and all seems well -- doesn&#x27;t leak out of the reservoir or past the ball bearings.  Anyway, this is THE product I had in mind when I was doing my research.  We&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and have no complaints whatsoever.  This is a great product!  And the price from Amazon, along with two-day Prime shipping, was great, too.</li>
    <li> I love this. You do need to use a thinner lotion. But it feels like giving your self a massage while appling. Win win</li>
    <li> Written instructions and suggestions would have been handy, but I managed to figure the item out.  Saying that, the sunscreen I applied using it seemed to go on rather thin.  I will have to experiment with it.  I may raise the rating as I use it.</li>
    <li> Works well. Sturdy handle.</li>
    <li> Smooth application. Easy to handle. Better than others (different brands) I have had.</li>
    <li> This works great for me.  It&#x27;s helpful and easy to use with my limited reach.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome.  Don&#x27;t need my wife to be home to go to the beach or the pool</li>
    <li> This is probably fine for lotions but for cream, it is not very effective.</li>
    <li> Since buying this item I&#x27;ve used it everyday</li>
    <li> Unlike the lotion applicator that I purchased last month, This one works very well.  The handle fits into the head very securely.  The body lotion head fell out from the handle and broke when it hit the floor.  I use it every day and am very satisfied Spend $20.00 and change for this item.  You will be happy you did.</li>
    <li> I was limited in my ability to bend and wanted to apply lotion.  This product is great.  the handle is long enough and it applies a think layer of lotion.  Nothing globby.  I use it every day and still use it even now that I can bend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product but you have to be careful with it. I used it with a moisturizing lotion and it seemed to spread the lotion fine. However, I wasn&#x27;t cautious while handling it, which resulted from the handle separating from the head, causing it to fall to the floor.  A handful of the balls fell out, one of which collapsed completely.  I put most of it back together but now there&#x27;s one spot that is empty because of the collapsed ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I frankly don&#x27;t know if any other products would fare better.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mom who has trouble putting lotion on her back.  Easy to use!  She is very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This is awesome and so much better than the $10 at Bath and Body Works.  Much sturdier and the balls are tighter so they don&#x27;t pop out nor do they let too much lotion out.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> sturdier than the last one I had.  Use lotion that is not too thick.  works really well</li>
    <li> works great however don&#x27;t screw the cap on too tight as it cracks very easily</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Sturdier than other models I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This works great. I can apply lotion to my upper &amp; mid back without assistance.</li>
    <li> No more dry skin after hot showers and hot tubs.  This unit is well made and hopefully will last me a lifetime....</li>
    <li> This really works! What a relief to finally be able to get lotion on those hard to reach spots all by myself. This provides a light, consistent coating and even a bit of massage action!</li>
    <li> great design, very practical</li>
    <li> I accidentally came across this product right after hurting my wrist which made it difficult to apply lotion. Who would have known that it is an excellent product for use even when you have two hands free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks and found that it spreads lotion (Jergens, in my case) better than can be done by hand. By hand, I tended to gloop it on. This device, however, delivers just the right amount. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do store it on end and have not noticed any problem with an uneven application. This is probably because it is very full with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the application head so much, I might buy it separately and keep it in the car during the summer when periodic light applications on the arms and legs are needed without glops.</li>
    <li> I have had several different brands, some working better than others. This is, by far, the best; the lotion comes out smoothly and evenly, and it&#x27;s easy to reach every part of my back. From past reviews, I had expected a little trouble in attaching both parts of the handle, but they went on with absolutely no problem.</li>
