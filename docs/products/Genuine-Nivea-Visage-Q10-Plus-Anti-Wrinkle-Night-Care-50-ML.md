      <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and has a nice scent to it.</li>

      <li>Jergen&#x27;s Face Cream, Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel, and Nivea&#x27;s CoQ10 Night Cream.</li>
      <li>and I am already using and loving their deodorants.  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it overseas on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I am a guy using this cream for the first time and loved it!</li>
      <li>This stuff would fly off the shelves like hot cakes because it works!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many skin products in the US, even ones that are at the high-end department stores, claiming to be effective and are imported from France, Germany, etc.  </li>
      <li>Since drugstores no longer carry it, I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to buy it through Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have used this cream for many years and it went off the U.S. market.  </li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve used La Mer, Clinique, Juicy Organics, Avon Anew and more).</li>
      <li>AND LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>AND I AM GLAD TO HAVE FOUND IT AT AMAZN.COM.</li>
      <li>It is not offered in most drug stores so on line</li>
      <li>notice that the cream made in Germany have nine more ingredients that the one from Thailand.</li>
      <li>like I remember it was when I was able to buy it here in the US.  </li>
      <li>I truly love it.  </li>
      <li>Wish it were available at drug and grocery stores in the US like it is in the UK, Italy and France!</li>
      <li>It is my new nightly ritual for beautiful skin.  </li>
      <li>This is the best cream ever for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Very good product BUT directions and information are not in English!  </li>
      <li>I works in fine as an after shave lotion.</li>
      <li>I do have fine lines</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my current skin care products.</li>
      <li>I wish it was available in stores in the USA.</li>
      <li>I were sure of its safety, I would certainly give it 5 stars!  </li>
      <li>Since I used the product in Europe I am familiar with it and since once met the standards.</li>
      <li>I mean don&#x27;t expect any miracles, but Nivea is the best cream I know of for treating (avoiding) wrinkles and making your skin soft and most importantly that I&#x27;m not allergic to!  </li>
      <li>I am only 36 but a wrinkle prevented is good news</li>
      <li>, I can live with that - haven&#x27;t had many more since the first week I started using this.</li>
      <li>I love the scent too - very feminine but light and not irritating.  </li>
      <li>The cream goes on smooth and is practically fragrance free - only a very light fresh scent.</li>
      <li>According to tests by the Washington Post, this cream was rated by testers as one of the most effective, even more than more expensive creams.  </li>
      <li>Also, in case anyone is wondering, the rose smell isn&#x27;t perfumey or gross.</li>
      <li>My Gram used Nivea on her face and had lovely sking at 88 years old.</li>
      <li>Reduces fine lines and makes skin soft.  </li>
      <li>I use it every night before going to bed, and I wake up every morning with smooth, clear skin.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make sense given how  consumed with looks most American consumers are.  </li>
      <li>This product is light, not as expensive, but it works beautifully.  </li>
      <li>I wake up every morning with clear, smooth skin.</li>
      <li>Nivea night cream is a wonderful moisturizer that is thick but not greasy and makes your skin feel and look years younger.</li>
      <li>Originally, it was available in drugstores along with other products in the Nivea Visage Q10 line.</li>
      <li>I really like this cream</li>
      <li>The skin really looks rejuvenated in the morning on using this night cream.</li>
      <li>still mosturized..very fast ship will order again</li>
      <li>This product came from UK but made in Poland - doesn&#x27;t matter really as it&#x27;s just</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and no breakouts.</li>
      <li>It came pretty quick and seems like the same product.  </li>
      <li>only downside is that it took more than 2 weeks to get it, but it&#x27;s not really a big deal as I was looking for it in the stores for much longer.  </li>
      <li>I must say, I like it better, and it&#x27;s half the price I was paying.  </li>
      <li>Most people who ask how old I am say, &amp;#34;you certainly do not look like 70&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I tried this specific cream because it was made by NIVEA and I am very well aware of their products having been raised in Germany.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, this product cannot be beat for its rich, dense texture that my dry sensitive cream thirsts for.  </li>
      <li>but wow!</li>
      <li>I have used this product now for the past 4 years and hope to always be able to optain it.  </li>
      <li>Looks greasy for a few minutes but soon looks fine.</li>
      <li>I would say is that it does not have anti-wrinkle action as intensive as I wanted.</li>
      <li>old &amp; wrinkeled)and have her looking gooood.</li>
      <li>it so soft and I can feel the change in my skin overnight</li>
      <li>WOW-</li>
      <li>I had to come back and write more I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days</li>
      <li>It used to be dry, red, irritated and super peely.</li>
      <li>It was recommended by Perricone as a low cost / high quality skin cream.</li>
      <li>The only positive comment I will make about the company , that the product arrived way ahead of the promised date (Oct 2nd -Oct 17th)</li>
      <li>was  a diffrent texture a little o more firm and</li>
      <li>I am guy in early 30s with no deep facial wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
      <li>dry, sensitive skin gals, just don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> She has used this item before and truly loves it. I had rather stay the way I am (old &amp; wrinkeled)and have her looking gooood.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream it so soft and I can feel the change in my skin overnight no lie....it feels like my skin after I woke up was  a diffrent texture a little o more firm and still mosturized..very fast ship will order again&lt;br /&gt;  Update! I had to come back and write more I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days and I swear the wrinkles in my forehead are fading! I am in almost disbelief. I want to tell everyone! I do have fine lines not major wrinkles keep that in mind but wow!</li>
    <li> I cried when I found out that Nivea visage facial items are no longer in retail shops in the the US.  This is the best cream ever for dry skin.  Finding a replacement has been impossible for me, unless I want to pay $90.00 for a high-end Q10 face cream found in department stores.  In my opinion, this product cannot be beat for its rich, dense texture that my dry sensitive cream thirsts for.  The q10 ingredient helps to soften the appearance of lines and wrinkles.  You will notice a difference immediately.  I have tried all sorts of \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; facial moisturizers and \\&quot;instant face lift and firming\\&quot; serums, but nothing stacks up to this one by Nivea.  When I found out I could order it from Amazon, I leapt for joy.  Yes, it is now more expensive than when it was in the drug stores until a couple of years ago, but I understand it is because it comes all the way from France.  Thank you Amazon for offering this wonderful product.  I love the scent too - very feminine but light and not irritating.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Picked this up in Switzerland for 20 Franks when I ran out of moisturizing cream while traveling.  WOW- I could tell the difference within 3 days of use; and I am not kidding.  This is an amazing cream and it does what it promises.  I don&#x27;t understand why American markets don&#x27;t carry it.  Doesn&#x27;t make sense given how  consumed with looks most American consumers are.  This stuff would fly off the shelves like hot cakes because it works!  I will order this online when I run out.  It is my new nightly ritual for beautiful skin.  I am only 36 but a wrinkle prevented is good news so I will use this cream from now on sine it works so well.</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended this cream to me years ago.  This is the best face cream on the market!  I have sensitive skin that after one month of use of ANY other cream, all of a sudden my skin will start showing dryness, flaking, bumps, etc.  I have used this for years and am so disappointed it has been removed from the US market.  I&#x27;ve been buying online, but feel like I&#x27;m putting off the inevitable of it being discontinued.  So periodically I will try another product so that I can assure myself I will have something.  But no matter what, nothing compares.  I&#x27;ve tried several from Clinique, Estee Lauder, Clarins, Chanel, Elizabeth Arden....  This is the best cream EVER!  Please keep making it NIVEA and please bring it back to the US.</li>
    <li> This WAS one of the best products out there. It has been discontinued in the U.S.. It was recommended by Perricone as a low cost / high quality skin cream. I am happy to see that I can order the cream (from France) on AMAZON. Please bring this back NIVEA and market your products! You hurt the customer base by taking away such an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many skin products in the US, even ones that are at the high-end department stores, claiming to be effective and are imported from France, Germany, etc.  This product is light, not as expensive, but it works beautifully.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t correct my wrinkles, I&#x27;d buy it for just hydration because it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> I recently ran out of my prescription face cream, and bought this to replace it. I must say, I like it better, and it&#x27;s half the price I was paying.  I have very dry skin, so I use it in the daytime as well as at night, it works well under makeup.  My skin is noticeably softer after just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Nothing compares. I use it every night before going to bed, and I wake up every morning with smooth, clear skin. Any other product leaves me red and flaky (I&#x27;ve used La Mer, Clinique, Juicy Organics, Avon Anew and more). It&#x27;s been discontinued where I&#x27;m from, and I&#x27;m a little panicked that it seems to have been discontinued in the US too! I&#x27;ve got five jars left and counting. Nivea, please do continue to sell this online!</li>
    <li> This product came from UK but made in Poland - doesn&#x27;t matter really as it&#x27;s just like I remember it was when I was able to buy it here in the US.  And it&#x27;s great - I mean don&#x27;t expect any miracles, but Nivea is the best cream I know of for treating (avoiding) wrinkles and making your skin soft and most importantly that I&#x27;m not allergic to!  All other creams I tried make me tear up badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it took more than 2 weeks to get it, but it&#x27;s not really a big deal as I was looking for it in the stores for much longer.  It&#x27;s just if you want to buy it as a gift for somebody - plan accordingly.</li>
    <li> According to tests by the Washington Post, this cream was rated by testers as one of the most effective, even more than more expensive creams.  Wish it were available at drug and grocery stores in the US like it is in the UK, Italy and France!</li>
    <li> I tried this specific cream because it was made by NIVEA and I am very well aware of their products having been raised in Germany. The cream goes on smooth and is practically fragrance free - only a very light fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this item that is no longer available in the USA!  It came pretty quick and seems like the same product.  I&#x27;m glad to have it, and sorry Nivea doesn&#x27;t make it for the US market any longer.  My Gram used Nivea on her face and had lovely sking at 88 years old.</li>
    <li> Nivea night cream is a wonderful moisturizer that is thick but not greasy and makes your skin feel and look years younger.</li>
    <li> I have used regular Nivea since I was a baby.  When Nivea came out with Nivea Q10 anti wrinkle cream, I tried it.  I have used this product now for the past 4 years and hope to always be able to optain it.  It is not offered in most drug stores so on line is my best chance.  As for the product itself, it definitely works.  Reduces fine lines and makes skin soft.  Most people who ask how old I am say, &amp;#34;you certainly do not look like 70&amp;#34;.  I agree, not to be vain.  It does the job and I would not go to any other product.</li>
    <li> Very good product BUT directions and information are not in English!  It comes from Thailand!&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I&#x27;m not at all sure of its safety or any hazards or precautions or even how best to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;If I were sure of its safety, I would certainly give it 5 stars!  As it is now, unfortunately, I have had to discontinue using this product!</li>
    <li> I use this cream every night and am very happy with it. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and has a nice scent to it. I wake up every morning with clear, smooth skin. I wish it was available in stores in the USA.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream ever ! Very moisturizing and no breakouts. I love this cream ! The best.</li>
    <li> This product is the best night creme that I&#x27;ve ever used! Originally, it was available in drugstores along with other products in the Nivea Visage Q10 line. Since drugstores no longer carry it, I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to buy it through Amazon. I learned from the vendor that it is imported from Europe now, which accounts for the price having almost tripled from its drugstore days.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THE PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND LOVE IT. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT GREASY AND HAS KEPT ME FROM HAVING DEEPER WRINKLES AT 73. I REALLY THINK IT IS THE BEST AND I AM GLAD TO HAVE FOUND IT AT AMAZN.COM.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m never branching out again. I have found my skincare trifecta here on Amazon. Jergen&#x27;s Face Cream, Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel, and Nivea&#x27;s CoQ10 Night Cream. My skin is now supple and glowy. It used to be dry, red, irritated and super peely. If I was dehydrated enough my skin on my nose would start to peel, BAD. I&#x27;d look like I had a bad sunburn that I was recovering from. I&#x27;m so happy with my current skin care products. The biggest surprise for me was that none of these products were the super expensive make-up counter creams. Also, in case anyone is wondering, the rose smell isn&#x27;t perfumey or gross. It smells like the rosebud tea I make with rosebuds.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for many years and it went off the U.S. market.  I was thrilled to find it overseas on Amazon.  My friends always tell me that I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles and this cream is why.  Buy some for yourself, it works great!</li>
    <li> Product is slightly above average I would say. I have dry, sensitive skin so I need a cream that works at eliminating dryness and does not break me out. I expected some breakouts as I started this and there were some very minor ones, I can live with that - haven&#x27;t had many more since the first week I started using this. It has also helped with dryness but has not eliminated it. Overall, it hydrates as I would expect.  I&#x27;m giving it the &#x27;slightly above average&#x27; rating (which would be 3&amp;1/2 stars but there&#x27;s no way of selecting the \\&quot;half\\&quot; on here!) because that&#x27;s what I expect from a cream - too not break me out and to keep my skin hydrated.  Also, a cream that touts having anti-wrinkling ingredients should yield better results than I&#x27;ve experienced to date. I&#x27;ve not noticed any improvements in that department yet - it&#x27;s not &#x27;softened&#x27; any lines or made the appearance of my pores seem smaller either. Overall, I would recommend it for us dry, sensitive skin gals, just don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> This one - even though it made a long detour from its home, met my satisfaction.  Since I used the product in Europe I am familiar with it and since once met the standards.</li>
    <li> I purchase Nivea Visage Q10 Plus Anti-Wrinkle night cream from Amazon and was shipped from Roundtheworldshopper in Thailand. After comparing ingredients  in the cream from Thailand and the one from Germany which I purchase brfore from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;I notice that the cream made in Germany have nine more ingredients that the one from Thailand. Also texture and color of the cream in not the same. It look like another fake product from China.&lt;br /&gt; Description of the product is in the Thai language. The only positive comment I will make about the company , that the product arrived way ahead of the promised date (Oct 2nd -Oct 17th)</li>
    <li> I apply the product to my face after shaving in the morning. I works in fine as an after shave lotion. Looks greasy for a few minutes but soon looks fine.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the original German product, useless, a copy of poor quality, far different from what the the real Nivea visage is.</li>
    <li> Very good cream with great moisturizing action. I am a guy using this cream for the first time and loved it! The skin really looks rejuvenated in the morning on using this night cream. Smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I would say is that it does not have anti-wrinkle action as intensive as I wanted. FYI: I am guy in early 30s with no deep facial wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it was made in Germany and I am already using and loving their deodorants.  I truly love it.  My reason for switching was because all of the other face creams that I have tried broke my face out.  This one does not.</li>
