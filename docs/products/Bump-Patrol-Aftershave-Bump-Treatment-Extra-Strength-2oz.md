    <li> I started going bald at a very young age and decide to go the completely shaven route. However i constantly used to get nasty shaving bumps and ingrown hairs on the back of my neck &amp; head. needless to say it was very uncomfortable for me and it looked nasty. so after trying just about everything i could think of i found bump patrol, i have used almost all of their after shaves and they all work extremely well. would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> My better half continues to order the stuff so it must be good.  He won&#x27;t use anything else.  He sais that other products don&#x27;t work as good as the bump patrol, but it must be the extra strength.</li>
    <li> This products works good and really keeps your skin moisturized.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs relief from razor bumps.</li>
    <li> This a must for people with sensitive skin, a friend of mine had me order this, and the razor bumps and the entire produce line is great. It may not always be in stock, but it is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I got horrible razor bumps on my legs and used this and within 48 hours they were gone. Good product!  I know its probably meant for men, but it worked great for me too!</li>
    <li> As a 52 year young African-American man (12 years in the military) with very bad pseudofolliculitis (very many bumps when shaving), I have tried for many years to find a remedy. &amp;#34;Bump Patrol&amp;#34; is as good a product as it gets but there are a few things to be aware of...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  First, you must apply it correctly. I have heard many people say that they do not get great results and the directions on the bottle and on their web site are not very detailed. For me, I have found that when you apply it TWICE a day (morning and night on clean skin) the action of the product is greater. Also,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Choose the correct strength for your skin type. The &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; formula is good but (again speaking just about me) it leaves a sticky film that does not seem to absorb or dry completely. I use the &amp;#34;Extra Strength&amp;#34; formula. It does not have the &amp;#34;sticky film&amp;#34; feeling and you can apply it more liberally. The more often you use it, the better the results. They also have &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;maximum&amp;#34; strengths.The &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; works quickly and gives noticeable results in under 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Use it everyday, even on days when you do not shave. It has moisturizing characteristics and heals the &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No product completely removes all bumps (and I have tried many!) but when I use Bump Patrol Extra Strength consistently, I have very clear skin. I am very pleased with my results. I just wish they would lower the price! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this item it does just what it is made for and keep my bump in order. I would tell friends about this item.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and it does provide comfort for my chin and head. I recommend this product for anyone dealing with shave bumps</li>
    <li> After reading the glowing reviews here I RAN and bought a bottle of this. I have had to use clippers for years because using a razor as a black man would cause great discomfort and ugly razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using a razor because of how smooth I am after... but the horrendous experience of razor bumps after has me thinking twice before attempting. I finally got the courage after grabbing a bottle. My experience wasn&#x27;t as great as the rest of the &#x27;reviews&#x27; here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different &#x27;creams&#x27; and ointments. [[ASIN:B00021DO6Y Tend Skin Care Solution, 4.0 Ounce]] would be my favorite although I still experienced razor bumps with it.  The solution that I have found that has helped me get that smooth shave without razor bumps is called Magic Shave, I use the extra strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Does help with irritation&lt;br /&gt;Does help prevent razor bumps&lt;br /&gt;cooling sensation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;very small bottle for the money&lt;br /&gt;need to apply 2, 3, 4 times a day (if not more)&lt;br /&gt;Does not STOP razor bumps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it did not stop the razor bumps... I had less, but I still had them, I could not recommend this product.  YMMV</li>
    <li> Ive been using this since my teenage yeas. Before this, my face was always red and bumpy. I cant imagine my life without it. I also use this with bump stopper 2 cream. I find that these 2 together keeps my face looking really good,</li>
    <li> First class is all I can say. I have tried a lot of these bump removal products and nothing but disappointment. This one works. It lives up to its name. A must have for persons who suffer from razor bumps. You won&#x27;t regret buying one. One of the best advertised products I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> it work for me on my lower back of the neck &amp; under my neck where i get the most ingrown hairs or hair bumps, shipping was very fast&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that my husband uses.  Works amazingly! We will continue to buy this and have no need to find anything else.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a bump since I started using the product.</li>
    <li> It prevented razor bumps for me. I would and have recommended this item. I can&#x27;t really find anything that I dislike about it</li>
    <li> I have been trying for years to find a product that works well , I have found it. The best I have used.</li>
    <li> Great product!!!!! Use as directed, and reapply if your face get&#x27;s wet.</li>
