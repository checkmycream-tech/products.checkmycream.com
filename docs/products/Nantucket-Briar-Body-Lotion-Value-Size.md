      <li>I have used it for 12 years and loved it - not any more - it is totally different - quite musky - not the lovely fresh smell it used to be.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it. This was a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my Mother-in-law. Nantucket Briar  has been a favorite of mine for years. I knew my Mother-in -law would love it ,too. The product arrived as promised. I would  buy from this dealer again.</li>
    <li> The new formula, necessitated by the recreation of a new scent after a fire destroyed the old formula, is awful.  I have used Nantucket Briar Body Lotion as a hand cream for many years, and it doubled as a perfume for me.  The old scent was so lovely--strangers came up to me all the time and asked me what my wonderful perfume was.  They were always amazed to learn it was my hand cream.  The new scent has a sharp &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; to it--it reminds me of a man&#x27;s after-shave lotion.  Unfortunately, I had invested in a whole big economy-size bottle of the new formula, but I don&#x27;t like to use it because the strong, aggressive scent hangs on ...and on.  The lotions quality as a hand cream is very good, but the smell is really hard to take. I will definitely not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I also bought the 6.8 lotion. The fragrance is not what I normally use....seemed much, much lighter than normal:( Not sure why?&lt;br /&gt;The room spray that I use for the bedroom was wonderful the correct fragrance...really wonder what happened with the lotions?&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps future buyers that love the fragrance &amp; Crabtree &amp; Evelyn!</li>
    <li> Thank good for Amazon! My favorite fragrance in a value size! Wonderful !!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother. I have been using this product for several years. After visiting, my mom enjoyed the scent so I bought her a bottle as a Thank-you gift. She loves it also. The scent is clean and fresh and lasts a long time. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mother for Christmas, as I do  every special occasion at her request.  I find many of the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn scented lotions are long-time favorites in our family.</li>
    <li> A great scent...in whatever form.</li>
    <li> I have liked Nantucket Briar for several years, and when I received my new body lotion, I thought for sure that it was mislabeled because it smelled nothing like &amp;#34;the original&amp;#34; NB.  I truly hope that Crabtree &amp; Evelyn will rethink what they have done to such a good product.</li>
    <li> Nantucket Briar has been my favorite scent for many years. I&#x27;m happy to see it in the large economy size.</li>
    <li> This item sells for $28 on the CrabtreeandEvelyn website..why would you pay more?  love this stuff! the lotion not only smells great, clean and fresh, but it is not greasy and the light scent stays with you all day!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product but could only find it outside my local area.  I purchased a bottle in Amsterdam many years ago and it was gone.  Thought I would look on Amazon...bingo!  Good price, quick delivery...great!</li>
    <li> The Nantucket Briar Body Lotion I just purchased does not smell the same and not as scented as the Nantucket Briar Hand Therapy I&#x27;ve been using. I much prefer the latter.</li>
    <li> Every time I apply this lotion my husband tells me how good I smell.  I love wearing perfumed body lotion, but need to be careful of the fragrance, as some of them make me ill.  This fragrance is perfect!  It has a very clean, refreshing smell.  It also costs a lot less than the body lotions I have purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivered fast exactly what I wanted In best condition</li>
    <li> this product line is getting harder and harder to find. I don&#x27;t understand why; the scent always remains true all day and It absorbs beautifully, doesn&#x27;t make me &#x27;slippery&#x27;! The shpment was prompt and arrived in good shape. Now I&#x27;m looking for the little soaps they used to make......</li>
    <li> my wife has been using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Wife has been using Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Nantucket Briar Body Lotion for many years and loves it</li>
    <li> This is my signature fragrance. I have been using it since 1988. I love the soft pleasant smell and use just a few drops every day. and get so many compliments. Especially from from grandchildren.</li>
    <li> I just love the scent ot Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Nantucket Briar body lotion. I use it daily after my shower, and it lasts, so that people think I am wearing perfume . It is a fresh, light,  scent tht I never get tired of. I was so glad to see it in the large bottle so it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;It is a scent that is pleasing to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Sandy.</li>
    <li> luxurious, and moisturizes beautifully.  Purchase it w/ the Nantucket Briar body powder for a truly lovely gift.  The scent is light and perfect for warmer months.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nantucket Briar for years.  I don&#x27;t live near a store, so it is sometimes a while between purchases.  My store went out, so I ordered here.  But the smell if this, while being similar, is different.  When you first dispense it quite alcohol smelling.  If this is a change in formula as others have said, it&#x27;s not a good one.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for several years and really like it. However, I had never had it in a pump bottle and it is so handy to keep on my counter and use.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not Amazons fault for the low rating.  It&#x27;s Crabtree&#x27;s fault for changing the formulation on a wonderful scent.  The new Nantucket Briar is different and not very pleasant.  Hope they get enough complaints and change it back.</li>
    <li> Something was very wrong with this product.  It had a really nasty strong smell totally unlike what I had bought before, or since at a store.</li>
    <li> The body Lotion smelled like it was old, the scent was not there. Next time I will order from the company direct. Live and Learn.</li>
    <li> love the scent, use it in combination with the shower gel &amp; cologne!  have received many compliments on this scent.</li>
    <li> What has happened to this classic???  I have loved it for years and just ordered the talc and hand cream and was SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  Not only is the fragrance completely different (smells in a not very nice way like Febreze!!!), to make matters worse, I had a nasty headache within about 10 minutes of using it, really bothered my allergies which Nantucket Briar has never done in the past.  PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Nantucket Briar for years and it is my favorite..</li>
    <li> The  delievery was right on time and the  lotion is devine!</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I discovered this product at a little shop in Florida and fell in love with the fragrance immediately. It&#x27;s a HUGE PLUS to be able to order in this value size. I will definitely order again and yes, from the same seller. Service, delivery, etc., was great!</li>
    <li> A wonderful, powdery scent</li>
    <li> In just a few words, if you are used to the original Nantucket Briar lotion, don&#x27;t buy this. It is horrible and smells like plastic. Thankfully the wonderful seller did caution me ahead of time and even after my purchase was very willing to have me return this disappointing product. I can&#x27;t emphasize how helpful the seller was; only the product is horrid. The buying experience was excellent, if that makes sense!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a light, yet effective, heavenly scent -- this is right for you. The scent is fresh and clean and the texture of the lotion is not greasy and absorbs fast. It leaves your skin feeling silky without the \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; aftermath.</li>
    <li> Nantucket Briar is my favorite and has been for years.  This was a great offer and service was the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the good reviews it got and I have to say it smells like a man&#x27;s cologne!!  Very disappointed by the smell it is not feminine or unisex its distinctly masculine scent.  If that is what you are looking for then great.  Gave it 2 stars for the texture.....it is nice and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> see review on bath powder. The size is a great value. This lotion readily absorbs into the skin...great after showering!</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell at all</li>
    <li> great value for a superb scent</li>
    <li> My  daughter just loves this lotion, cannot get it anywhere else for this price.</li>
    <li> I love the clean smell and the way it makes my skin soft . This size bottle is perfect and the cost is really good too</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Perfect product.</li>
    <li> I do love this stuff! It makes me feel so good to put it on it makes taking a shower fun.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, easy to rub into skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to all perfumes. But Nantucket Briar has a natural scent that does not give me migraines even though it&#x27;s pronounced. I love it.</li>
    <li> Have loved this lotion for quite a while so happy to find in value size.</li>
    <li> With the cold weather upon us, this lotion helps with dry skin. It&#x27;s a favorite fragrance of mine and the price was right.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion thinking I was getting the same product I had loved previously. Not so--they&#x27;ve changed the scent and I&#x27;m not a fan. If they&#x27;re going to change the scent, they need to re-label it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the scent change.  To me the new formula smells flat and not appealing at all.  If it does not go back to the original formula I think I will have to find a different brand.  \\&quot;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Be carefull now - C &amp; E have changed this product.  The new updated scent may not appeal to you!!!</li>
    <li> Beware!  If you like the original scent then check this out before you buy it.  The packaging is the same, but the scent has been changed.  I have used it for 12 years and loved it - not any more - it is totally different - quite musky - not the lovely fresh smell it used to be.  Why change a good thing!!!  And not make it obvious!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve paid almost as much for less in the past. I&#x27;m thrilled to have a size that will last longer.</li>
    <li> Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Nantucket Briar has a wonderful soft/light fragrance. You will love the way it makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Ever since I received Nantucket body lotion as a present 7 years ago, I continue to buy it.  I get a better deal when I purchase it through Amazon.  I get more lotion for the money and always arrives as described.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  I have been using this product for years; and, it seem they have drastically altered the scent.  It now smells like dime-store aftershave, no longer has the scent that other people would complement me on and ask what it is.  Shame on Crabtree and Evelyn for doing this to their long-time customers.  Needless to say, I returned it (NOT Amazon&#x27;s fault!).  If they have done this to more of their products, if I were Amazon, I would drop the product line!  Very unhappy………….</li>
    <li> I ordered this back in March using a gift card.  I have been wearing Nantucket Briar for many years.  I just opened the bottle the other day and the smell is just gross.  It is not Nantucket Briar.  And, since it&#x27;s past the 90 days I can&#x27;t file a complaint with the seller.  What a waste of money.  If you buy anything from this seller open it right away!</li>
    <li> I love the light sweet fragrance of this lotion.  It also leaves the skin soft and nourished. I even like a light film of it on the face at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Nantucket Briar is a special scent, brings back memories of time spent on the Atlantic seacoast, not to mention it makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite body lotion.  She wouldn&#x27;t be without it!  .</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to all the women and girls that wear lotion. I love this lotion. It&#x27;s got a great scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products for decades. They never disappoint. Nantucket Briar is a bit flowery/musky - not too sweet - more towards lavender than flowery. Perfect for me</li>
    <li> My mom discovered this fragrance a couple years back.  This is her one and only birthday and Mother&#x27;s Day gift request!  Love the fragrance!</li>
    <li> My brother bought this for our Mom one year and I fell in love with the fragrance - use it all the time!</li>
    <li> A friend gifted me with the body wash so I decided to get the lotion.  Very nice and the scent lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this clean scent and great with hydrating your skin.</li>
    <li> I love the clean scent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells (asthma) but this one never bothers me.  I love the smell and the consistency and feel on my skin.  Wish the value size was available at all times.</li>
