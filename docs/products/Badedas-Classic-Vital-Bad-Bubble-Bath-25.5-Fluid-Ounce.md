      <li>/&gt;Original review from 2009: &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Good To Be Bad&amp;#34;  I was introduced to Badedas bubble bath about 30 years ago by my sister, who said the stuff had near-magical properties (it does).</li>
      <li>My grandfather loved his christmas gift.</li>
      <li>to see a good product being changed.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>If your lady likes bubbles, get her the good stuff.</li>
      <li>But it does smell good.</li>

      <li>and I&#x27;m delighted to find it again.  </li>

      <li>It shipped and I received in great shape in a more than timely manner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR VERY MANY YEARS.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a good thing if you like the scent, because it does a good job clinging to your skin unlike many bubble baths.</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC bubbles!!</li>
      <li>If you are used to the wonderful smell of Badedas, you&#x27;ll find this formula much messed with!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was happy to find Badedas at a good price through amazon. It is a terrific bath/shower gel that, I think, originated in Germany. Vitabath is very similar and I suspect it is related to Badedas, but made in the USA. I find Badedas (or Vitabath) superior as a gel to give bath water a pleasant scent. I&#x27;m not sure just what the scent is, but I would describe it as woodsy, or evergreen. The Badedas bottle lists what I think is horse chestnut extract. I prefer baths to showers when I have the time, and like to use Badedas every time. Amazon vendors advertise several versions, at various prices. The \\&quot;classic original\\&quot; is what I buy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s so refreshing after being out all day at the beach, gardening or working out.</li>
    <li> Badedas has been a favorite since I first discovered the product while living in Australia. The fragrance is fresh and invigorating. Some bubbles have flowery scents or are soapy, Badedas is neither. Totally invigorating and you don&#x27;t need a lot to get a tub full of bubbles. Love it!</li>
    <li> Not easy to locate this particular product.  I can find the \\&quot;Vitabath\\&quot; brand, and while&lt;br /&gt;I do like that one, this one is great.  Love ,love,it.&lt;br /&gt;Use it in the shower in the A.M. and in the bath in the P.M.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t get enough of the uniquely fresh, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a GREAT price, and when I ordered the shipping was \\&quot;free\\&quot; that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick ship;  happy with my \\&quot;Badedas\\&quot;.  &lt;3</li>
    <li> Can anyone tell me were you can still find the old formula Badedas? This new formula is nothing like the old one.</li>
    <li> i have always used Badedas in germany,where it originated..in my opinion there is nothing better, if u enjoy the aroma of natural pine..it pours like karo syrup..one capful is enough for one full bath..close ur eyes,relax and breathe in this wonderful aroma..it&#x27;s simply the best</li>
    <li> Love this bubble bath. Thinking of purchasing a case. Received in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> Great product, but unknown in the USA. If your lady likes bubbles, get her the good stuff. The Mercedes Benz of bubbles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest: I bought this because it had high reviews. I wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with the bubble bath varieties I&#x27;ve found in the local grocery store, and did a search for the highest rated bubble bath on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent at first. The bottle was larger than I expected, and the first whiff made me wonder if I&#x27;d use it all. It&#x27;s a sort of woodsy pine, a much more masculine smelling bubble bath than I&#x27;d ever experienced (I am a woman). Upon using it, it turned my bath water absinthe green (awesome!) and generated a dense, luxurious foam that grew into am alarmingly large mountain of bubbles. A little of this stuff goes a long way, and a quarter of a cup was certainly excessive (note: the directions on mine are in German. I have no idea how much I was supposed to use, but trial and error is half the fun).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about half an hour in the tub, I&#x27;m happy to report that I really do love the smell. It&#x27;s relaxing without being cloying, and my skin feels incredibly smooth. Five stars!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have been using it for years with great joy, it makes bathing a relaxing and soothing experience. I reccomend it highly!</li>
    <li> best bubble bath , have used it since childhood</li>
    <li> This is the original Badedas I used to buy on my trips to Germany. The same exact product is marketed here in the US under the name of \\&quot;Vitabath Gelee\\&quot; at about three times the price of Badedas. Great value and shipping is resonable.</li>
    <li> This is the best bath gel I have ever used. Smells great and leaves your skin really soft.</li>
    <li> I agree with that assesment. I think it is a wonderful product. I also think its a bit over priced but what do I know. I think cosmetics are way over the top too. Women&#x27;s cloths, shoes, all more expensive than I would like to pay but hey, it&#x27;s only money. Gas, up there, loaf of bread 4 bucks, good coffee 3 bucks, need I say more. Just buy some for your wife or girl friend, you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> This product is heavenly.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try, I was not disappointed.  If you want a wonderful, relaxing, invigorating bath, give Badedas a try, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> My grandmother in the bahamas uses this. It&#x27;s amazing. I love the scent if it...it somehow wakes you up and it&#x27;s like your inhaling eucalyptus in a sauna. I would highly recommend this for people with body odor and for the woman who just wants to relax.</li>
    <li> I started using Badedas after a friend brought me some from Bermuda. After I ran out of the bottle my friend left, I went back to my old product, for one shower, and I HAD to have my Badedas back again. So I checked on Amazon.com and of course I found it. Now I won&#x27;t be without....Love the scent, and no need for body lotion afterwards....wish there was a product like this made in the USA, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be, so I buy Badedas, made in Germany. They sure do know how to make a girl smell great!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this bubble bath and had forgotten about using it before.  My daughter used to get it for me when she was going to beauty school.  I just happened to find it on here and soooo happy to see it again.  It smells so good and leaves your skin so soft and clean smelling.  I will continue to buy it as long as it is in stock.  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> My Mother used to bring Badedas back to be from London. I wasn&#x27;t sure where to find it here. I found this on Amazon &amp; found it to be the most reasonable &amp; it looked like just what I wanted. I purchased. It shipped and I received in great shape in a more than timely manner. I love it. I will buy all my Badedas from this place. For those of you who haven&#x27;t tried badedas-- it is a luscious gel with a classic fragrence-- woodsy-beautiful.</li>
    <li> The Badedas I just ordered is supposed to be new and improved. Nothing improved about it. Just much lower viscosity , so probably diluted to make more of a profit.&lt;br /&gt;Sad to see a good product being changed.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again. Will switch to another product. Have been using it for over 30 years. To bad, saying good bye to an old friend. Will check with manufacturer if they now sell a diluted version or someone is reselling it at a lower quality.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles based on reviews here. I was looking for a less expensive alternative to Vitabath moisturizing bath &amp; shower gelee. It smells about the same, but is better suited to a bubble bath than a shower gel. It is drying to the skin when used as a bath gel, which I believe is due to the propylene glycol. Most of the organics found in Vitabath seem to be missing.     Vitabath Original Spring Green moisturizing bath &amp; shower gel (partial list): Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, Equisetum Arvense Leaf Extract, Zea Mays (Corn) Oil, Lanolin Oil.     Badedas: Aesculus Hippocastanum (Horse Chestnut) Seed Extract, that&#x27;s about it for the Badedas.    In short, Badedas smells good, has cool German label, but I really miss the Vitabath. If I were using it in a bath rather than a shower, I&#x27;d probably be more pleased. I&#x27;m using it up, but hope to find a sale on Vitabath one day soon, and use this as a backup.</li>
    <li> Make your bath feel like you are at a spa.  The smell is divine, bubbles are plentiful and green water is quite lovely!  No problem for my sensitive skin.  Just a little quantity in a bath is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTHING better, bath-wise!</li>
    <li> Badedas is the greatest! We discovered it years ago (more than 30) in Europe but it is difficult to find here. When I found it on Amazon I was thrilled. It came so fast and my husband has been greatfully soaking everyday since.</li>
    <li> this is a great product, the best choice for a quality bubble bath. make sure you read the other reviews on the product. the water will turn green with the bubbles, but that&#x27;s where the magic is.</li>
    <li> Badedas has not changed in 40 years probably longer. Still an amazing green as it goes in. Pine scent great bubbles</li>
    <li> Expensive, comparatively, but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR VERY MANY YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT.  HAVE A GO. YOU WILL REPEAT THE ORDER!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this bath for over 10 years It is the best bath that I have ever used. The aroma is so very relaxing that you can almost melt into the bath. I have a friend that travels to Germany several time a year and brings back several bottles for me on every trip. Up until now I haven&#x27;t been able to find it here in the U.S. It&#x27;s good to know that if my friend ever stops traveling to Germany I&#x27;ll still be able to get this wonderful bath.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described. It arrived real fast..every item had specific details and that helped a lot in making a decision</li>
    <li> I first used Badedas in the UK and loved the wonderful scent, terrific bubbles and how clean it left your bathtub.  Highly recommend it as a gift.  But make sure you get one for yourself.</li>
    <li> I have long despaired of finding a decent bubble bath in the USA, long been a fan of Radox, the UK brand, but recently bought Badedas, and remembered it from childhood. Worth the trouble, great long lasting foam, fantastic pine, fresh clean smelling scent that filled my whole apartment and my skin feels lovely. Best of all I feel like I had a spa day in my own tub.</li>
    <li> Very happy to find it.  Use to buy in Germany when I was a Flight Attendant. Will Purchase again. Thank You!</li>
    <li> This Body wash is great and the excellent clean scent lasts all day long.  Try it, You will love it,  One of the best things from Germany</li>
    <li> Purchased four bottles of Vital Bath through Amazon from Parthenon Foods, Inc. in West Allis, WI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All went very smoothly and package arrived via FedEx in fine condition. I would certainly recommend purchasing products from this vendor. Badedas is not easy to find in the U.S. and once you&#x27;ve used it becomes quit additive!</li>
    <li> This is the best bubble bath ever!  You dont need much, all you need is a dime size amount.  Run it under water and you will be amazed.  I purchased this product while living in Italy and once I returned to the United States I could not find this product anywhere.  Once I saw it available on Amazon I ordered it immediately.  You will not be disappointed if you purchase this product.</li>
    <li> It smells way to much like intense chemicals and its green... witch is  kind of weird but the smells is intense and its not very soothing or relaxing...not sure why it has alot of good reviews but it stinks ! I was itching alot afterward and smelled like it.going with an organic choice instead!</li>
    <li> I once used a very good bubble-bath product called \\&quot;Vita-bath,\\&quot; made in Germany.  In the past years, there was no product that I could find to match it.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that this might be a knock-off.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased when I found that this product met my expectations.</li>
    <li> i agree with all the great reviews for this product. It&#x27;s heaven.  I play a ton of sports and work out with a PT 3 days a week. I add it with Village Naturals Therapy bath salts and it&#x27;s amazing.  I also bought the salts here at Amazon. [...]  If you have sore muscles and want to soak in a hot bath with bubbles, great smells and powerful bath salts - combo these 2 items!  It&#x27;s awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I accidentally stumbled upon this German bubble bath and it smells good masculine even. I don&#x27;t often take a bubble bath but the stuff was pretty cool and left my skin feeling good. I just might indulge in this again.</li>
    <li> Found this in common in Germany in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, and the whole family loved it,  An all natural, great smelling addition to your bath water when  soak is more wanted than a shower!..Great for dry skin, fine for other types.  Used to get it from the Army PX system, but they dropped it.  Found it thru Amazon at a competitive price.  Try it!  You&#x27;ll join millions of Germans and retired military who bask in this horse chestnut based soak.</li>
    <li> I love the Badedas brand and this Bubble bath/Body wash is Faboo!!  I am on Auto-Delivery for this product so I am never without it.  The price on Amazon is GREAT and the large size makes it even better!  One of my &#x27;Desert Island&#x27; must-haves!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Badedas for over 40 years.  My aunt used to send it to me from Germany and I stockpiled it for years.  I&#x27;ve finally run out and I&#x27;m delighted to find it again.  I wouldn&#x27;t take a bath without it.  I love the smell and the way it softens the water and the way I feel after using it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase of Badedas bath wash through Smallflower.com/Amazon.  I have found it at half price at my neighborhood Marshall&#x27;s store, but it is very difficult to find/in seemingly short supply here.      However, it came in 2-3 days via Amazon shopping.  I was thrilled.    This product has horse chestnut extract, is made in Germany, and smells absolutely awesome.  I bought two.  There is nothing like it.  It is truly green liquid gold.</li>
    <li> Update 3/7/15-- The formula for Badedas has been changed by Unilever, and I no longer recommend this product. Several significant ingredients have been omitted, the pine scent is gone, the consistency is thinner, and the experience like an ordinary bubble bath. Save your money, this is not the original German formula Badedas many people used and loved for decades...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review from 2009: &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Good To Be Bad&amp;#34;  I was introduced to Badedas bubble bath about 30 years ago by my sister, who said the stuff had near-magical properties (it does). She said it&#x27;s full of unusual botanicals (true), makes tons of long-lasting bubbles (yup), smells incredibly good (oh yeah), and leaves the tub sparkling clean (also true).  The cost back then was around $1 an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve become mostly a shower-taker, but recently, when my 20-year-old bottle of Bededas turned up empty, I decided to revisit the stuff.  Remembering my sister&#x27;s warning that the &amp;#34;Vita-Bath&amp;#34; products are an American copy of Bededas without all the great botanicals, I was looking for the genuine article.  Lo and behold, I found it on Amazon, of course, from several dealers at various price-points.  Smallflower (aka Merz Apothecary of Chicago) seems like a reputable dealer, selling the real deal, and even with somewhat exorbitant shipping, the price is now LESS than $1 an ounce.  Pretty good for 30 years.  Shipping was quite fast, by the way, and the product arrived UPS on the sixth calendar day after ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This Badedas (now owned by Sara Lee!) is apparently the original formula, made in Germany, with the horse chestnut oil that helps make it so magical. It also contains limonene, a very citrus-scented hydrocarbon derived from plants, and linalool, a more floral-spicy scented chemical found in over 200 species of plant.  Not the kind of stuff you&#x27;d find in your average drugstore bubble bath.  The overall scent is somewhat pine-y, and incredibly fresh and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A small amount of Badedas added to running hot water makes a lot of luxurious bubbles.  The overall sensation is one of slight skin-softening without the oiliness you get with some products.  Also, a slight sense of skin-tightening, but this is somewhat subjective. USE NO SOAP in a Badedas bath-- you don&#x27;t need any.  Just a washcloth or sponge, and you leave the bath feeling quite clean.  Badedas seems to absorb dirt and body oils and odors into solution, and it all goes down the drain, leaving you, and your bathtub, quite clean.  Remarkable stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you ever take a bath for relaxation, or even a wash-up, I&#x27;d highly recommend Badedas.  Smallflower has an excellent price on this 25.5 ounce size, and if you take one bath a week, this bottle should last you at least two years!  Badedas is a wonderful luxury bath product, and would make a terrific gift for a bubble bath fan, or even yourself and/or your mate.as added to running hot water makes a lot of luxurious bubbles.

    <li> I have been using this product for over a decade but this particular shipment seemed to be a counterfeit as it did not really turn my water deep green and didn&#x27;t bubble well. I returned it.</li>
    <li> My german friend introduced me to this years ago, &amp; I love using it. I&#x27;ve had to locate a german store to buy it, and the price was always so high.  I was thrilled to see I could order it on Amazon with free shipping for half the price of the store. No bubble bath produces bubbles like this one, &amp; it smells so good.</li>
    <li> First smelled this 30 plus years ago.  I still love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED BADIDAS FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  AT FIRST I WASN&#x27;T SURE I LIKED THE AROMA AFTER USING IT.  NOW I&#x27;M HOOKED AS IT&#x27;S A FRESH, UNIQUE SMELL</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m in the woods when I bathe in this. Makes lots of bubbles and smells so very nice. Love taking baths with this.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRAVELED WORLD WIDW AND I SWEAR BY MY HOT BADEDAS BATH AFTER A LONG HARD DAY TO TOTALLY RELAX ME,</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on its reviews, and I do not regret it at all! The scent is very strong if you take a whiff from the bottle, but once in the bath water, it is much less in your face. This bubble bath is not overly bubbly, which I like, gives off a very relaxing yet stimulating scent, and makes your bath water a pale green. Which, to me, adds to the relaxation for some reason. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I am a 65 year old man and I don&#x27;t take frequent baths (I shower). A bottle lasts me for a couple of years. Add to that the fact that I&#x27;m an asthmatic who is triggered by scents. Badedas is not some perfumy, artificially scented &amp;#34;bubble bath&amp;#34;, it is an old Swiss herbal formula in the same class as Olbas Oil. Badedas is a natural, therapeutic experience that is truly indescribable. All I can say is try it once, you will never find anything to compare!</li>
    <li> I love the original green Badedas with its refreshing smell. Not knowing that the Company changed it - not mentioned on the Amazon webpage, I purchased 3 bottles. The bottles came with a sticker &amp;#34;new formula&amp;#34;. It is nothing like the old and loved Badedas, a pale blue color and the aroma that a lot of people loved is completely gone. This smells like - NOTHING AT ALL. Don&#x27;t waste your money - you probably can get a similar bubble bath at the 99cent store. VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> This is a superior bubblebath with a wonderful smell and texture.I  hope they never discontinue it.I have bought several for presents with great success.Try it it is worth every pennt</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time while stationed in the UK.  Another assignment to Germany and I bought more.  I love the refreshing scent and it does not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> Great stuff@ The original scent not the watered down new version!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very bubbly and the bubbles stay for a long time.  Very pleasantly fragrant and relaxing, I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as woodsy, but it does have a natural and clean type of smell.  My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like scents and cologne, but he&#x27;s totally fine with it.  It does turn the water into a bright yellow/green color.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff....world&#x27;s best shower gel.  Nothing like it made in the USA.  It&#x27;s a common product in Germany, but nothing like it in U.S.</li>
    <li> My mother is German and we visited often as kikds. The smell Badedas is implanted in my memory--fresh, piney loveliness.  I actually splurged and bought it for my husband, who&#x27;s a manly-man, no foo-foo guy. The first shower: \\&quot;On my god, what IS this?\\&quot; He loves it.  It&#x27;s a great treat</li>
    <li> My name is Mickey Jones and I have been using badedas for over twelve years ,and not don&#x27;t but won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> Great body wash.  Smells absolutely fabulous and feels good too.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Badedas when I lived in Germany many years ago. Once you use this product nothing else can compare to it. I am glad to see that it can be purchased now within the States but someone is making a lot of money on it. It is still quite cheap in comparison if bought from a store in Germany. At any price, it is worth every penny and your skin will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> I really love Badedas and have for decades. I discovered it when I lived in Germany. And have used it ever since. Happy to buy in on amazon as I sure can not find it locally.  It makes me happy to walk into my bathroom or bedroom hours after I have used it and I can still smell the lingering scent of the Badedas. I just wish they made a candle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, today I washed my 2 labrador retrievers with it, and I must say, they both smell quite fetching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall continue to order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon.com</li>
    <li> Great luxury and comfort.  I&#x27;ve found nothing better for a good soaking bath. Great for the muscles and the skin.</li>
    <li> Just received my Badedas .  I had ordered what I thought was original.  It turns out toe be Classic Original .  Which is not original at all.  It seems to be the new formula.  Which does not come close to being as good as the original.  It is sad to see a good product, made into a cheap imitation.  Save your money.  I have used the original for many, many years.  I ordered three bottles for $52.  I could have gotten a better copy in the grocery store for five dollars a bottle.</li>
    <li> This shower gel isn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s choice, but I like it, and it is very difficult to find in stores here in the US.  Amazon to the rescue - thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a generously sized container and will make your bath or shower a pleasure. The aroma is unique and wonderful.</li>
    <li> there is no bath/shower gel that even comes close. The smell the lather are perfect. Make sure it is the German formula. You will be hooked.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 50 years,started out in Germany where I grew up and now I buy it at Amazon or ebay</li>
    <li> I am a longtime fan of Badedas and was so pleased to find it reasonably priced on amazon almost 3 years ago.  I have continued to order pretty regularly and after running out of my last bottle, I placed an order for another as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, imagine my disappointment tonight after sliding into the thick bubbles that my bath water wasn&#x27;t the fresh green Badedas color. What&#x27;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poured a little out of the bottle into my hand and instead of the weird yellow-green, it came out a clear blue-green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent fades too once it&#x27;s in the water. Where it used to fill my entire bathroom and bedroom with it&#x27;s lovely alpine fresh scent, it&#x27;s now just a pale shadow of the Badedas I fell in love with all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first through was that I got a fake. After a quick internet search, I found out that Unilever changed the formula. I am so completely heartbroken and will not be ordering Badedas again until they change it back.</li>
    <li> I love this bubble bath, and have found it increasingly hard to find at an affordable price. I was pleased to find it here and will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the aroma of Badedas other than \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot;.  It isn&#x27;t a wholly accurate description but close.  I have used this product in the bath and in the shower and it always leaves me feeling clean, refreshed, and smelling good.  I recommend trying this - the aroma may not be everyone&#x27;s ideal but if you like it you won&#x27;t find anything else like it.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff reminds me of home when in the usa for school. It is that classic smell that stays with u all day and float around the house</li>
    <li> When I would sleep over my Oma&#x27;s as a child she would always get out the Badedas Classic for bathtime and I absolutely loved it.  Unfortunately, when I went to buy a bottle for myself I was sorely disapointed. The top of the bottle came with an ugly pink sticker proudly proclaiming \\&quot;Neue Formel\\&quot;, which to my dismay meant New Formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now much darker, and is almost blue in color.  It does not change the bath water to that lovely spring green, does not smell as good, and did not leave my skin feeling as clean.  The bubbles, if you care about them, were plentiful though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not appear to be counterfeit, as I read other complaints about the change on the German amazon reviews and on a Badedas facebook page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will not be buying again until I hear the formula is changed back.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast shipment.</li>
    <li> The container makes it appear that this is the Classic Badedas that many customers have loved for years. However, the container is the only similarity to that product. Apparently Unilever, which now owns this company, has changed the formula. You&#x27;ll know that from the pink sticker that says new formula (in German), and even more from the changed product. It no longer has that wonderful Badedas smell. It no longer turns your bath water that weird but familiar green. It does make a lot of suds, but they are like the suds from liquid dish soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why Unilever changed this product. Perhaps some of the ingredients became too expensive? Perhaps they did market research showing that customers wanted something different? That is hard to believe given all the negative comments I&#x27;ve seen online, but perhaps there are satisfied customers who aren&#x27;t writing in. I&#x27;m not among them.</li>
    <li> OMG soaking in this bubble bath is pure heaven and brings back fond memories of my childhood.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s been around for ages and still as great as ever</li>
    <li> I remember using Badedas as a kid more than 20 years ago and just loving the scent.  On a nostalgic whim, I searched for this product on Amazon three months ago and was surprised to find it.  I initially bought the shower gel version but found that it did not live up to what I remembered - the scent was just not as distinct or unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later, I decided to order one bottle of the bubble bath version after seeing a picture of the bottle -- it looked similar to the bottle I remembered from more than 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bubble bath version of Badedas was definitely much better and lived up to my expectations.  The scent was a little stronger --- fragrant, but not overpowering.  The bottle was marked as a bubble bath, but had just the right viscosity and solubility for use as a body wash.  It was simply perfect and I have been using it ever since as a body wash -- I&#x27;ve found that very small amounts are sufficient for use as a body wash and still have not gone through a bottle in almost two months.  A little caution is needed when pouring it out as the bottle spout is just a normal, round opening which makes it easy to pour too much out.</li>
    <li> This has a fragrance and consistency identical to that of Vitabath Spring Green, for those familiar with that product. The Badedas version is more fun to own, because the label is in 3 languages (no English, though!) and you&#x27;ll feel like a beauty maverick making niche discoveries, even though Badedas is as ubiquitous in Germany as Irish Spring is here.  All I can say about this delightful product, which I&#x27;ve repurchased again and again, is that it is in a class by itself. It is so super-concentrated that one teaspoonful on a bath pouf will get you squeaky-clean, as will one tablespoonful (about 1/3 capful) in a full bath. The color is really cool-- it makes the bathwater glow green! But, more important, the fragrance is aromatherapeutic pampering at its best (cool, green, herbal, and piney, but not overly antiseptic or masculine) and the formula delivers a wonderfully refreshed clean feeling. I don&#x27;t know what the horse chestnut extract does exactly, but I do know that a hot Badedas bath can make up for a long night shift, a rough afternoon with the kids, or just about anything else life can dish out. It restores me down to my soul, and makes me smell wonderful for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat would be for those with dry or sensitive skin-- this is a highly fragranced, highly detergent product and isn&#x27;t particularly skin-softening, especially if you are used to Dove or Caress-type body washes with added moisturizers. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all; I just use lotion on my arms and legs if need be. But if you are sensitive to strong cleansers and fragrances, you may want to proceed with caution.</li>
    <li> I prefer showers to baths and have come to use this daily as body wash..It is the most awesome clean fragrance and it lasts..Your entire bathroom smells amazing and fresh..It lathers up and really cleans your skin.I will be ordering more for myself and some as gifts..I do not want to use soap again..My daughter loves it in her bath...</li>
    <li> This bubble bath has a natural scent that is not at all floral. It&#x27;s woodsy with fur and pine notes; the pine does smell reminiscent of floor cleaner but it&#x27;s not quite strong enough to be bothersome. This would be the perfect gift for a man who likes baths.</li>
    <li> This is the very best bubble bath in the world. :) The whole house smells delightful with this in the tub. There are two styles of bottle available and I wish this was the smooth style..The smooth style is so much more attractive.. This ridged version is a little 70&#x27;s style.. but.. I had an empty one in the other style and so I just transferred the contents. Best of both worlds.  Another advantage of the smooth style is that it has a pin hole dispenser which is very efficient. You only need a tablespoon or so for a good amount of bubbles.. I found that most bubble baths dry out my hair and don&#x27;t do my skin any favors but Badedas doesn&#x27;t affect my hair at all and it&#x27;s great for my skin.. You can not smell one chemical from this lovely mixture of botanicals. :)</li>
    <li> I have loved badedas&#x27; earthy woodsy hazelnutty smell since i was  akid.  I love taking baths with it.  Makes the water nice an neon too!  it&#x27;s a very distinctive smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased Badedas because I have loved Vitabath for many years and was assured that Badedas was virtually identical. As it costs signifcantly less, and there have been complaints about the quality of recent purchases of Vitabath, I thought it was worth a try. While both are thick green bath gels, the smell is very different.  Vitabath has a light, clean, refreshing scent while Badedas has strong musky undertones that I can only describe as smelling like a combination of stale sweat and cheap perfume. I do realize what smells good or bad can be highly subjective, and many truly seem to like the scent of Badedas but it definitely does NOT smell like Vitabath  and if you purchase it as a substitute you will most likely be disappointed. I find the smell unpleasant enough to render my purchase useless.  (My husband concurs, so it&#x27;s not just me!)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  A soaking in its suds is both refreshing and relaxing and I have not found its equal with any other bubble bath.</li>
    <li> This product has been packaged and repackaged for years -- I use this \\&quot;Bubble Bath\\&quot; as shampoo, body wash, and to make bath salts and scrubs.  Horse Chestnuts have a peculiar musky chlorophyl scent that is it&#x27;s own thing.  It isn&#x27;t mint, or bay, or citrus -- it&#x27;s musky.  But not in a Brut aftershave way.  It&#x27;s subtle, and it combines with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s scents differently.  It&#x27;s in the range of expensive patchouli, but much lighter.  It won&#x27;t make women in spandex spontaneously appear and want you, stupid.  But it does smell good.</li>
    <li> Spicy world of USA, Inc badedas classic vital bad bubblr bath. very good in a bath and shower. lasts about a month. twenrty ounces plus Mrs Gayle Baring</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this product, my bath time has become a luxury experience.  Light a candle and incense, pour yourself a glass of wine, and luxuriate!</li>
    <li> It is a pity that this delicious gel is no more available in many countries (Spain is one of them) and has been substituted by a bad copy (Badedas \\&quot;Original\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;Good things tend to disappear!.</li>
    <li> Love this bubble bath the bath is soo soothing and relaxing and the smell is like you r taken away to a outdoor spa in the nutty pine forest. The aroma is awesome. I guess if u r not much for the out doors u may not experence the same. I have it on auto ship. Ty Amazon for carrying this awesome product.</li>
    <li> The new formula is a big disappointment and nothing like the original which I have been using since 1960 when I lived in Heidelberg, Germany .  The new formula does not have the same aroma, is very thin (too thin), and the color has changed from the forest green to aqua.  I hope there is consideration for creating two versions because this one is considerably inferior. Bring back the original &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34; please.</li>
    <li> Nothing compares to this product.  Its aroma endures hours and hours and you feel renewed, just like a new born baby.</li>
    <li> Nice and special product for bubble baths, with a longlasting solution. . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I use this bubble bath in the late fall and throughout the winter.  The bubbles last for a long time, and it seems as if this product helps &amp;#34;melt away&amp;#34; the cold winter blues.</li>
    <li> Still the same great product we came to know and love while stationed in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;We often recommend to friends...</li>
    <li> This product I have used for many years perfect  Shower Gel. No grease or residue left in your shower, wonderful fragrance and a perfect clean feeling.!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found this anywhere but on Amazon.  All you need to know is \\&quot;buy it!\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll be hooked for life... this is most definitely the best bubble bath on planet earth!</li>
    <li> I ran across this when stationed in Germany.  WOnderful fragrance and great bubbles.  So glad I could find it here in the states.</li>
    <li> I first learned of badedas many, many years ago from my Wife&#x27;s relatives living in Bermuda before it was available in the United States. They would bring it over as a gift for my Wife and In-Laws when visiting. It is, and always has been my Wife&#x27;s favorite bath product!! Perfect for those &amp;#34;At Home&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Treat Yourself&amp;#34; kind of days where you ladies can relax, forget about your worries and enjoy a moment of bliss!!  For You Men,,, if you buy this product for your special lady be advised she will let you know BEFORE shes need another bottle!! You&#x27;ll love the long lasting after sent it leaves on her body!!</li>
    <li> My grandfather loved his christmas gift. Thank you</li>
    <li> SMELLS LIKE REAL PINE TREES</li>
    <li> The original Badedas shower gel was perfect - although this is a bubble bath, it is similar, and has the same scent, which was my favorite.</li>
    <li> I bought this one because I was fooled by the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; written on the bottle and the &amp;#34;made in Germany&amp;#34;. If you are used to the wonderful smell of Badedas, you&#x27;ll find this formula much messed with! The maker is now &amp;#34;Unilever&amp;#34;. I have a bottle I bought in the UK (also made in the UK) which smells like the true &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; one, but it doesn&#x27;t advertise it on the bottle. I compared the two formulas and they are different. This one smells different, as if it were made with cheaper ingredients. That characteristic strong pine-horse chestnut smell is gone. Even the colour has been messed with. It dilutes into a cheap, artificial, almost urinous yellowish-green that makes you want to run away from the bathtub.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great way to have a bubble bath.  I feel like I&#x27;m in a forest with the pine smell.</li>
    <li> Out of all the bubble bath type products you can buy, Badedas is top rated. I&#x27;ve used it for the past 5 yrs now. It&#x27;s been a family tradition for my Mum and Aunty to use it, and it&#x27;s just one of those fresh pine smelling baths, that make you want to curl up after and drift off to sleep. 2 caps under running water, soak for at least 10 mins, and you&#x27;re good! It&#x27;s a huge bottle as well, so it lasts. I do use other kinds of bubbles,Bath and Body have left me dry skinned, and the bubbles don&#x27;t last. I always come back to this one. I hope my review helped you.</li>
    <li> I can understand how this would be one of those scents that some people will really like and others will (just as passionately) dislike; honestly, you really just have to try it and see. If you&#x27;ve never used it before, and you are considering it, then I highly encourage you to go ahead because I took a chance and this is a &#x27;lil slice of heaven in the bathtub...in my opinion. It definitely smells green to me, but not in a piney or astringent sort of way, more like early spring forest after a rain. Nothing floral, just clean fresh intoxicating green. Also, aside from whatever remarkable stuff they are putting in there to make it smell so sublime, it also makes my skin incredibly soft. Very soft. It&#x27;s quite wonderful really.</li>
    <li> Good bubble action, looks toxic green in tub (the Grinch would love it) but rinses right out. Has a really strong smell (clean, almost pine-like but not &amp;#34;cleaning product&amp;#34; clean) and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
    <li> Terrific pine fragrance - a little goes a long way - always fun when the green glop turns to chartreuse when water is added.</li>
    <li> I love Badedas and used it for many years but until recently didn&#x27;t realize it was available here in the U.S.  Some of my friends will find Badedas in their Christmas stocking this year.</li>
    <li> Honestly, just toss out all other bubble bath products.  This one is made with lactic acid (excellent for women&#x27;s skin in particular, if you do your research) and horse chestnut extract along with a fragrance you won&#x27;t find in any American-made bath product except Vitabath.  (And the original Vitabath Spring Green formula is essentially a more expensive version of this product; and in my opinion inferior.  I use Vitabath Original when I run out of Badedas.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is top-notch; you don&#x27;t need to use any soap with this product if you&#x27;re using it as a bubble bath.  It cleans you.  And it seems to clean the tub as well, because this is the *one* product I have ever used that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Gets you a \\&quot;shower-fresh\\&quot; clean feeling from a bath (Usually baths relax me, but showers make me feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot; ...)&lt;br /&gt;2) Requires absolutely no clean up - you&#x27;re clean and so is your bath tub; no residue to bath tub ring AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;3) Everyone in the family loves; men and women will both appreciate the unisex \\&quot;forest/clean\\&quot; smell.  It&#x27;s hard to describe yet you&#x27;ll never forget it once you smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t something you can just go pick up at the store in the US (usually, unless you live in New York or L.A.) - so Amazon provides an easy way to keep a supply of this on hand.  Buy a bottle for your wife (or, heck - yourself) - you won&#x27;t regret it.  Also makes a very unique gift - the receiver of said gift, if American, has likely never tried any bath product even close to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality can&#x27;t be beat, at any price.  Stock up.</li>
    <li> My husband visited Germany and brought this back for me. I used it all up and really missed the fresh smell and calming effect. The smell is not too fruity or perfumey, but very clean smelling.  I was super excited to find this product on Amazon.  The bottle is really big and all you need is a small amount in a bath tub, so it really lasts.  If you are a bubble bath junkie, like myself, you have to invest in this bubble bath.  There&#x27;s nothing quite like it!</li>
    <li> exact item I buy in Europe at a fair price. I will use this sign to purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s pretty much it - I didn&#x27;t like the smell and found the color to be a bit much. But this product really has a strong following, so it&#x27;s really just my personal preference that the pine-like smell is not my thing. The bubbles were good enough, but I felt like I was bathing in floor cleaner due to the scent. I used it to fill the bathroom handsoap dispenser and it works well. But my hands have the lingering scent. This is a good thing if you like the scent, because it does a good job clinging to your skin unlike many bubble baths.</li>
    <li> Silky bubbles, fresh clean scent - Badedas Classic is fantastic. There is no fake fruity or floral stink to it. Good for men and women. I only use a small amount for a garden tub - so a 25.5oz bottle should last you quite some time so I think the price is fair. I order this on Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap since I was a little girl in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;It smells refreshing, clean, and green!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves you moisturized, not squeaky, keeps your jewelry shiny, and has a pleasant texture to use.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend dispensing it into another container that squirts easily into your hand... the widemouth bottle can lead to overly generous dollops of soap!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Love this product when I used it overseas. It is difficult to find in the US. Love the smell and alway give it has a holiday gift for my family (who always request it).</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and its not easily found in stores. It leaves your body feeling clean smelling fresh and soft! The buying experience went well and the price was great!</li>
    <li> The product never came - they took my money then disappeared.  Not even worth giving them a star. I want my money back.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is enough frangrance that is calming and fresh without being overpowering. Lathers well and feels clean on my skin. Good price, too.</li>
    <li> Back in 1970, our family went to Germany for my dad&#x27;s work.  In our hotel room, they had Badedas packets for the customers.  Over the years, I would remember that first experience upon our arrival in Germany.  I never forgot this product....the smell, the bubbles, what a great experience after a long day of traveling.  Out of the blue I decided to do a search for the product on-line; to my delight, I found it.  It is everything I remembered it to be and I have loved being reacquainted with it.  I feel sure I won&#x27;t be without it ever again.</li>
    <li> Great product;have been using for years and your price and service are exceptional&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning and have recommended to friends</li>
    <li> Have not seen the product for some time, but when I get into a bath with BADEDAS the bubbles and scent soothe away all my cares!!!  Highly recommended to ease tension!!!  The smell goes through the whole house and my family love it!</li>
    <li> This is a german product that we use.  This came quickly and was priced well..bubbles last a long time, smells good, and soft on skin.</li>
    <li> Shipping is outrageous but the product is the original badedas from Germany and induces a deep relaxing sleep if taking a bath before bedtime. Scent is strong but pleasant.</li>
    <li> I cannot find the Badedas in the states.  I love it</li>
    <li> This is the new formula, not the original formula.</li>
    <li> Used this product for many years.</li>
    <li> I first enjoyed this fresh scent at a friends house in England. Lovely.</li>
    <li> The original is still the very best!  First purchased in 1975 in Madrid Spain. Recommended highly for the clean fresh after shower odor that lingers.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitabath for many years. It has always been a wonderful product. But, now it is so difficult to find, and they have introduced a new line of scents into the line that I don&#x27;t care for. I also have a suspicion that Spring Green has been&lt;br /&gt;reformulated. I&#x27;m not sure-but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same to me. I have read many reviews about Badedas, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did. It was very similar to Vitabath, but reminded me of what Spring Green used to be. This is  a quality product, and makes for a very nice spa like experience.</li>
    <li> This is almost &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; in joint and pain relief. It kind of turns you into mush! When I can&#x27;t sleep? THIS is what I use...the fragrance is liked by some and not liked by some. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34;. It IS a different smell. FANTASTIC bubbles!!</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite shower gel.  I have it on autoship.  It&#x27;s full of unhealthy ingredients, like SLS,  but it smells wonderful and he won&#x27;t switch.</li>
    <li> This has a fresh,clean somewhat pine like smell in my opinion.  It does not take a lot of this product to make a bubble bath or just lathering up.</li>
    <li> This seller is advertising this as the &#x27;original, hard to find formula&#x27; and it isn&#x27;t. I would not have purchased it has the description been accurate,</li>
    <li> Got hooked on this while a student in Berlin in the 70s. It&#x27;s true that Vitabath is nice, but not the same and not as rich. Used to get it in Aruba, but somehow it disappeared from there. Then found a place in Florida that sold it--for a price. A few years ago, while living in Paris, some German friends visited and brought me a bunch. That, I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit, is when I learned that it&#x27;s pronounced ba-day&#x27;-dahs, not bah&#x27;-da-das. Finally the bunch ran out and I discovered Amazon. This is a good price. Not as good as in Germany nearly 40 years ago :-) but good. This stuff is rich, makes masses of long-lasting bubbles and has a soothing, strong herbal smell. I&#x27;m a gin drinker and it seems like the perfect bubble bath for someone who loves those potent smells. Nothing relaxes me like a long, hot Badedas bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just read that Badedas has a hint of patchouli, which is distressing as I despise Patchouli. Have never noticed it in all these years however, and will try and pretend I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s wonderful i have used it on and off for over 20 years.  I am glad i could get it from you.</li>
    <li> Overpriced, but the heart wants what the heart wants.  Got addicted this in Germany.  My family loves this stuff.  Luxury.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it smells SOOOO wonderful! I first learned about it when traveling in Europe. My favorite soap.</li>
