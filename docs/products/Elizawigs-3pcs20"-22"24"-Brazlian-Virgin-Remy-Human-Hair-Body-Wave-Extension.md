<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This hair is horrible!!! Please do not spend your money on it!!! It&#x27;s very thin and very misleading on description and picture!!!</li>
    <li> worst hair ever. I washed the hair after a few weeks of it being in and it matted so bad that i had to cut it out my head. Please don&#x27;t waste your money, hence it was pretty cheap but still! They wrong for this and yes, the hair is very processed, don&#x27;t be bamboozled.</li>
    <li> I will give an update I just purchased the hair....it can&#x27;t be no worse than human hair.com....1 star for now</li>
    <li> Do NOT buy this hair!  I want a refund</li>
    <li> The worst hair EVER!!!  It&#x27;s fake and burns when you flat iron it and it&#x27;s thin and sheds really bad.  Total scam!!</li>
    <li> The hair was great but it is a little thin bundle. And everyone that&#x27;s on here complaining needs to stop because you get what you pay for. If you want better quality then buy more expensive hair👌🏾🙂</li>
    <li> The hair didn&#x27;t feel like Brazilian , it was rough , &amp; it also didn&#x27;t last long at all ..</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I saw this hair. It supposed to be 100g but looks like 50g. The hair is very thin. I am definitely getting a refund.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve Heard So Many Bad Reviews Like It&#x27;s Processed, It Gets Nappy, Blah Blah. Well From Someone Who Usually Buys $400 Hair I&#x27;m Impressed I&#x27;m Only Using This Hair For A Pony Tail But It&#x27;s So Soft And No Shedding What So Ever. And The Curls!!! Trust $70 Is Well A Great Price For This Hair. ORDER GOLDEN PERFECT HAIR SELLER!!</li>
    <li> When I first got the hair I was excited to put it in, as I usually so with Virginia hair I washed the hair first. The water turned a nasty brown color so I just took it out to dry. After installing it I wanted to curl it but the hair melted on my new flat irons! This is a waste of money and not like the description at all.</li>
    <li> As of now I LOVE the hair.I haven&#x27;t installed it yet but it looks exactly like the pictures.My only complaint is that the hair wasn&#x27;t 1b(it was brown)Only length that was was the 24&amp;#34;.I&#x27;ll update my review when I install it.</li>
    <li> IT MATS! IT SHEDS! IT TANGLES SO BAD THAT I HAD TO CUT IT!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR!!! SMELLS OF CHEMICAL AND WET DOG!</li>
    <li> The length is okay, hair is soft. The problem I have is the hair is very thin.</li>
    <li> S*** horrible. Coulda paid at least 50</li>
    <li> This hair was pack hair and the hair napped up in 3 days😡😤</li>
    <li> Just received my hair yesterday and had it sewn in today and I love it!! It&#x27;s so soft and shiny and the length is perfect! There is almost no shedding and it blends really well with my real hair!! Love this product and I will be purchasing it again!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this hair from the sender &amp;#34;Dave Carpenter&amp;#34;. This hair is not 100% Brazilian hair it’s more like cheap pack hair from the beauty supply that has a &amp;#34;brazilian feel&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m giving it 1 star because it’s actually 100% human hair not a blend. The hair is not soft and is very dry and the wave pattern is terrible. It’s pretty coarse and the ends are ridiculously thin. The hair was shedding as I was pulling it out the package. I ran my hand thru each bundle 3 times and got so much shedding each time. I&#x27;m used to getting 3 bundles (300g) so I know what the weight should feel like. The minute I took it out the bag it came in I knew this was not 300g at all. Each bundle seems to be about 60-70g. To make sure I am giving an honest review I put these bundles next to some bundles I already had (fresh out the package), both the same length and both claiming to Virgin Brazilian hair (Last 2 pics). The bundles on the LEFT with the BLACK BAND are bundles I already had from another hair company and the bundles on the RIGHT with the 2 GOLD TWIST TIES are the hair form this order. As you see the bundles on the left are full and the hair is soft and silky its feels great and looks great. Its acatually virgin Brazilian hair as it claimed and the body is full. NOWWWWW The bundles on the right (Elizawigs &amp;#34;brazilian&amp;#34; hair) is thin at the ends and its nowhere near as silky as the hair on the left. I will not bother co washing or conditioning this hair I am actually sending this hair back today for a full refund. I will not be ordering this hair again. I reviewed Dave Carpenters reviews and they are hit or miss that should have been my first sign. As a stylist I try to find affordable quality hair for my clients. I would not recommend this to anyone. You can actually get better quality with pack hair at your local beauty supply. Please do not buy this hair although its cheap and amazon you can get a refund it’s still a hassle not worth going thru. I like to give honest and full reviews with pics so you can see MY experience thoroughly before wasting your time.e honest and full reviews with pics so you can see MY experience thoroughly before wasting your time.</li>
    <li> I received my hair and my 20&#x27; hair was totally different from my 22 and 24 but and soon as I contacted them they sent the correct one out... CUSTOMER SERVICE A1.... but overall the hair ain&#x27;t all that but it will do.. you get what you pay for.. I mean don&#x27;t buy it thinking you can wear it for months NO... MAYBE a month and a half depends on you and how you manage it.... If I choose to purchase again I&#x27;ll buy from them.</li>
    <li> horrible thin at bottom waste of money, not good quality hair in the slightest. bad wish i could return it.</li>
    <li> This is hair is not what it&#x27;s described to be. The good part about it is I paid for 3 bundles and they gave me 4. I guess they knew how thin it is so they added another bundle. The hair was nice and soft before installed. When I installed the hair it became dry , would shed crazy , and mat up. I&#x27;m very particular when it comes to my hair . I didn&#x27;t even have this hair in for 2 whole days before I took it out. It was just too thin , I was more than embarrassed to say it was Brazilian . In fact, my Korean friend said that&#x27;s supposed to be Brazilian or synthetic Brazilian inspired. When I received the package it had synthetic wig on a label , I ignored it thinking maybe it was a mistake because the hair seemed so pretty. I am a firm believer that this is SYNTHETIC. Please do not waste your money. I&#x27;m sooooooo upset that I spent that much on this hair and didn&#x27;t have it in no longer than 3 days.</li>
    <li> 1. Hair seems like a human mix. DEFINITELY not virgin nor 100% human. Tried to wand it and the hair was melting all over my curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;2. Has a weird color while washing. I could never get out all of the yellowish color when rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;3. Once I cowashed and shampooed, the \\&quot;waves\\&quot; never returned.&lt;br /&gt;If I could I would rate this hair as a 0!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay it just can not curl it burns</li>
    <li> Do Not buy!!!!!!  Gets nappy after 2 days!!!</li>
    <li> Got my hair today in very upset i had a hair appintment for today n couldnt even go due to me missing a bundle of hair</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair with my hard earned money,and (THOUGHT) the hair was going to be Awesome,and be all kinds of wonderful,&amp;#34;Surprise&amp;#34;....after dealing with this bundle set of (TRASH) for a few months,Yes ladies I said a (few) months..&amp;#34;lol&amp;#34; I went ahead and Threw it in the trash were it belongs!!!..At first the hair was nice,and manageable for around 2-3 weeks (But) I noticed that the hair (SHEDS) like crazy.I went to the salon and had the hair Processed with a deep conditioning keratin/silicone treatment.The hair was super soft for around a week or so,then it went back to looking like a (Rats nest)..&amp;#34;lol&amp;#34;..I know how to care for weave and B-4 you even ask..lol...I sealed the wefts prior to my install,the wefts were Not cut they were folded to insure a shed free installation...What a joke!!...no matter what I did the hair (Fell out)!!!....If your looking for (Virgin Brazilian) hair extensions,I would (NOT) suggest you purchase this (hair)...Unless your goal is to have hair that looks like a Frizzy,Matted,mess...!!!!....Buyer Beware....</li>
    <li> Love love love this hair. Really friendly customer service. Soft silky hair no shedding. This is a must buy.&lt;br /&gt;Nice colour n everything.</li>
    <li> This hair is synthetic and I want a refund is true the length and the amount of the bundle is 100 GM each but the hair is made of plastic so greatly disappointed do not buy</li>
    <li> I gave the product a four because it sheds alot but the beauty about it is that it lasted five months. I like that the hair holds curls beautifully, the length was correct, the colour was super nice and people always compliment me on it. I hated the shedding, it got nappy at the back of the head, sometimes it go really dry. I would recommend this hair to anyone. It requires care. I use the cream of nature shampoo and conditioner and the foaming lotion to curl with flexi rods.I would recommend sealing the weft, wish I had done so. I just made a purchase of the five pieces from the same vendor elite pure i think thats there name.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC HAIR, very thick, last a long time, very soft, curls stayed for a long time, I LOVE THIS HAIR. 1st time I ordered it came right away.. 2nd time I tried to re-order it was going to take 3 weeks so i had to cancel the order.. If the shipping was faster I would order this all the time..</li>
    <li> OMG THIS HAIR IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SOFT . CAN WIT TO PUT IT ON REAL BRAZILIAN VIRGIN HAIR RIGHT LENGTH TOO. I WILL ORDER THIS HAIR AGAIN</li>
    <li> I literally had the hair in for a week , it immediately loss its body and it was out of my head on the 15th , mind you I installed it on the 31st of October</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think the product would come as fast as it did. The bundles are nice sizes and soft, I will defiantly order from them again.</li>
    <li> Why didnt i look at the reviews before purchase? I wanted hair&lt;br /&gt;that doesnt shed. This hair sheds so much its rediculous. I know its not gonna last till i want it to. When i recieved it i was like its pretty but look so synthetic...... ive had brazilain hair and this one had way to much luster. Will i buy again? No they need better product. Im mad cuz i spent 130 on somthing thats not gonna last me. Im not even gonna try to dye it that will probally ruin it for good.</li>
    <li> this hair is not human hair and don&#x27;t buy from this buyer…. i hate the hair, and i spend a lot of money on this stupid hair...</li>
    <li> Really Think and sheds alot</li>
    <li> The texture is good.  It&#x27;s been almost a month and it has not tangled up.  It has gotten frizzy and it sheds a little.  Other than that, for the price it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> The hair that i received has some shedding, Great for the price though,Shipping was very fast,Hair is very soft and manageable</li>
    <li> This hair is fake....I haven&#x27;t installed it yet so I don&#x27;t even know if it curls!! But as you can see I washed it and All the black coloring came off! When wet it mattes up! Its terrible! I&#x27;m. So upset! Y&#x27;all please don&#x27;t by this hair..I have a to rate it so 1 star is here but it doesn&#x27;t even deserve that!</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m happy with the product. The hair is real soft, and when I ran my fingers through the hair, it wasn&#x27;t no shredding. The package was shipped in approx. 3 days :) I will write another review once I install it.</li>
    <li> The hair is ok... It does matt up and tangle but love the length</li>
    <li> This hair is great soft touch no shedding very nice hair affordable. Got a 24 22 20</li>
    <li> I loveee the hair. Everything Seems to be true to description, but I&#x27;ll need more because I have a Big head and I love a full head. It is 100% Human Hair. I got NO SHEDDING at all and I mean NONE. Shipping was fast. I ordered Thursday and received it today. Seller&#x27;s communication skills were great. I&#x27;ll do an update review when I install, but EVERYTHING is Good thus far.</li>
    <li> I loveeee my hair. I love the inches, the texture., everything.. i curl with a wand every few days.. the price has my business hooked!! This is my second time ordering hair from amazon.. both times were a sucess lucky me!</li>
    <li> I have bought this hair twice it is very good tangles only a little I washed and deep conditioned the hair be fore I used it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like this hair .... it Shed a lot and it&#x27;s so short ... not true to length ..&lt;br /&gt; Bundles very skimp I had to go buy another bundle ... The had hair to been dyed and it&#x27;s not soft it feels weird the hair I brought from the store is very soft and shiny and this hair in the back is very rough looking I had it for about a month and I&#x27;m about to buy new hair Friday ... it was a waste but you pay for what u get ... This hair is not good</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Sheds like crazy. It may be horse hair.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product 4 times. Twice through the same seller and 2 other merchants. Be careful in choosing your seller, because they DO NOT carry the same product. Do your research on your sellers go to their profiles and look at their reviews and ratings. Look for the honest ratings, one seller selling this hair has a lot of bogus feedback, but you can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you Tom Hair has really thin hair at the bottom (like you need to cut 3 inches off, its so bad)and really thick at the top. I hated it. Wig Fashion Inc&#x27;s hair is really coarse and mats up really bad. Its texture is more like Yaki. OMG and it sheds sooo bad. I hated that hair too. I am not convinced that any of the sellers have true Brazilian Hair. The hair is more 100% Human Hair Brazilian Body Wave \\&quot;Style\\&quot;. I&#x27;m sure there is real virgin hair on this site, but not for the cheaper prices. Beauty &amp; Beyond&#x27;s hair is the closest thing to it. I have no experience yet with ElizaWigs (The seller). I know the brand of hair says ElizaWigs on the title, but trust me that is not the brand just a seller. More than likely when you get your hair there will be no brand name on it. Mine never had one. They were all packaged different and of different quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing some shopping around I found the seller I beleive has the best product and I am very pleased once again with my hair. It is very soft and manageable and there was PLENTY of hair. My hair is thick from root to tip and it is very true to legnth.</li>
    <li> Good hair No problem very fast shipping I will be ordering it again</li>
    <li> Bought this hair for my little sister she got it installed in December and she loves it. She says after wearing curled she can straighten it with no problems not back to curly. Hsir Definitely true to length she said she will buy again</li>
    <li> The hair came fast but it is very thin and sheds. A full can not be done you will need more hair.</li>
    <li> Love my hair I got more than just 3 bundles cause I like my hair thick but if u like a more natural slick look than this is all u need.</li>
    <li> I NEVER post reviews because my experiences with Amazon are normally ok however with this purchase I Feel like i really wasted my money. The ends are extremely thin, and i had to cut off 6 inches to get a uniform length. Not virgin hair, and Not worth the money AT ALL. Total ripoff.</li>
    <li> I wish i could have given this no stars. It was extremely thin it absolutely did not seem like 100g per bundle as advertised. It probably was 50g  per bundle and it could not do my entire head. It sheds profusely and is over all a bad purchase. Extremely disappointed as i had higher expectations.</li>
    <li> We tried to dye hair and the hair started to melt. Product was unusable Was a waste of $100</li>
    <li> The item was pretty good it shedded a lot over all it was pretty good for the price.</li>
    <li> Very good hair!! Very Happy with my new Brazilian definitely will recommend to a few friends!! Trust worthy real hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair from beauty and beyond the shipping was really quick and the company was happy to answer any question I had BUT as for the hair it self DONT DO IT. This hair is terrible it looks and feel synthetic and even tho it&#x27;s thick it&#x27;s extremly stringy. It tangled like crazy, she&#x27;d like dog hair and was always frizzy I had to constantly apply argon oil and brush this hair. I wore this hair for 2 weeks before becoming extremly sick of it and I&#x27;m the type of person who like to baby hair and even I didn&#x27;t have the patience for this hair don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve had 15 dollar hair that&#x27;s better than this and anybody who like this hair has obviously never had good virgin hair cause this isn&#x27;t it. Only gave it 2 stars cause the company</li>
    <li> Im a weave fanatic I&#x27;ve warn just about every kind of virgin extension there is this hair by far is one of the best its soft silky with the use of the right products very minimum tangling and very little shedding and the price was amazingly affordable....luv luv luv this hair I will be shopping with this supplier again trust Me its worth it if you luv hair as much as I do don&#x27;t let another minute  pass u by make your purchase!</li>
    <li> this product from this seller &#x27;&#x27;le hair&#x27;&#x27; is completely different to what you see. They are false advertising... the bundles were so thin that could never be 300g....I was soooo upset when I got this hair....bought this same hair last November from beauty and beyond and it was perfect....nice big bundles soft, tangle free, just perfect...never me ordering from LE HAIR AGAIN.....</li>
    <li> dont spend your money.plz sintetic 100%</li>
    <li> When it came it was beautiful the third day of me having it I can tell its fake. It lost its natural wave. It knots up pretty bad  I put moisturizer in it every night comb and braid it wake up in the morning take it down give it 10 minutes and its already knotted up. Ive died it other than that takes color pretty well.</li>
    <li> This hair is absolutely gorgeous ...its longggggg and thick...i have had some shedding but its not bad ..i will purchase this again</li>
    <li> .this hair was very tangled and didn&#x27;t color very well at all.I was not at all pleased with it ,there was shedding and the hair started  to melt and feel wirey to be honest I wanted a full refund but I only received 30%of 119.00 back what can I do about that??</li>
    <li> Dont be fool there are liars it say 300grams no more like 200 and they say virgin hahaha not at all its been pre dye black tryed to dye it and it turned orange im trying to warn you dont waste your money on this bs</li>
    <li> The product I received was nothing like the picture that is posted on the website so I felt swindled</li>
    <li> so I just ordered this hair yesterday 11/14/13. Today is 11/15/13 which means fast delivery, I did use two day shipping. When I opened the hair and ran my fingers through it it was very soft, no tangles or shedding...it does have a factory smell to it! I&#x27;m going to wash the hair,dry it, apply shed glue just cause, and install it. I&#x27;l let you know the outcome.</li>
    <li> I thought the hair was great til I tried to dye it and it doesn&#x27;t turn blond, it turns a dirty orange color, I recommend a color remover before a dye because I thinks it is pre dyed already. I&#x27;m very unsatisfied because now I have try and match the color to my hair.</li>
    <li> The shipping was really quick but this hair is not what I expected. It&#x27;s very thin and the ends got dry and nappy when I co-washed it before applying it to my head. I have not cut any wefts and it sheds like crazy. I have had brazillian hair before a cheaper kind and I must say it was better than this. I don&#x27;t like to complain, but when it comes to my hair... That&#x27;s a different story.</li>
    <li> Installed the hair the other day and its good quality.  Soft and smooth.  But smelled like factory, other then that i think this hair is good.  Going to buy more bundles for great price</li>
    <li> BUNDLES ARE VERY THIN HENCE THE PRICE. BUT HAIR IS SOFT AND THERE WAS SPEEDY DELIVERY. VERY SATISFIED FOR THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> This hair is amazing. It is very soft very little shedding and the color is very vibrant. I have bought a lot of hair over the last couple of years and this by far was my favorite. Also with the price it makes me want to buy it every time. I hope they continue with this kind of quality because I am definitely a fan for life. I would like to see if they do Cambodian Straight hair too.</li>
    <li> I love my hair..will always do business with u</li>
    <li> The hair is very soft and long . The smell is the only bad thing</li>
    <li> To me the hair was not 4oz and the hair does not smell good</li>
    <li> I was actually really intimidated because I read the reviews after I placed my order. It was delivered in two days, and I actually got an extra bundle! It feels like great qualit, it&#x27;s very soft and definitely human. I haven&#x27;t had it installed yet, but I am very exited to have it put in. I would definitely recommend this hair so far.</li>
    <li> Fake hair obviously... Looks pretty but it&#x27;s fake... Upset... tangles and sheds wish I listened to the reviews would have bought else where it did come early that&#x27;s the only good thing I guess</li>
    <li> For anyone that is about to purchase this hair please read my review. Everyone knows that brazilian hair comes in different grades starting from one onward the higher the grade the better the quality. I purchased lengths 20,22,24 when i got the purchase and yes i know the hair should be stretched i got lengths 14 and 18 i havent installed it because the quality is poor and they did not come in bundles as advertised they were also grossly under weight and can only complete quater of a whole head then when running your fingers through the hair it sheds like a dog and looks very synthetic  please take heed to my review. I paid good money for this hair and i did not get my money&#x27;s worth and i only gave them one star because i had to rate it. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS HAIR!!!!!!</li>
    <li> 3 bundles and came with a extra free one very thin to the end had to order a 26in&amp;#34; to make it longer Sheds to much my boyfriend complains about the hair all over when I brush it a lot of hair comes out I want buy product again I should&#x27;ve listen to these comments!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Does not shed</li>
    <li> The hair was lifeless, wave not deep enough and the weft too short also it smells like chemical</li>
    <li> Great hair! Favorite Amazon virgin hair seller, I advise all to try at a good price also!</li>
