      <li>/&gt;Another great feature that may not be important to you, but is to me:  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These clippers were provided in exchange for an honest review</li>
      <li>They look as nice as a nail clipper</li>
      <li>Nice nail</li>
      <li>Nice quality and metal.  </li>
      <li>but....these are really awfully nice. &#x27;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of a nail clipper connoisseur and collector.</li>
      <li>Nice nail clippers.</li>
      <li>A nice weight and heft.</li>
      <li>received these as a sample and this review is my absolutely honest and rather enthusiastic opinion...</li>
      <li>Looks nice.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for good quality nail clippers, I can easily recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best clippers I have found by far.</li>
      <li>Safety is a concern with this company and they have paid attention to that fact in designing these very fine</li>
      <li>spring action is excellent and I love the finish on these things.</li>
      <li>The risk of this happening is even greater in all variations of cheaper clippers with a smooth (as in slippery!)</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed, and actually didn&#x27;t know that better quality clippers even existed.  </li>
      <li>I still love them, but...</li>
      <li>An attractive set of masculine-styled stainless clippers.</li>
      <li>These are ok.</li>
      <li>Features to love about them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What more could a nail clipper be?</li>
      <li>think most nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought were bought while travelling and are the cheapest things ever.</li>
      <li>I never thought I&#x27;d be impressed by nail clippers, but this set should become the standard by which others are judged.  </li>
      <li>What more can</li>
      <li>Just okay</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s nice because it minimizes the amount of filing to get a smooth edge.  </li>
      <li>* Aesthetics: A great modern twist to the design -</li>
      <li>Now what could be better than that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>hesitate to call nail clippers &#x27;elegant&#x27;....</li>
      <li>I was a bit questioning by the packaging, but these are a great product and highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>Therefore, I will ALWAYS state at the very top if I received the item complimentary from the vendor, and what I DON&#x27;T like about the product(if any)</li>
      <li>These clippers make a nice clean cut, and the slots in the handle make it easy to not slip.  </li>
      <li>This is not a deficiency in my opinion; you will clearly be better served by purchasing these fine, top-quality clippers and combining them with a separate dedicated nail file of your choosing.</li>
      <li>These things are made of high quality stainless steel with a very attractive buff finish to them.</li>
      <li>They fit very comfortably in your hand and easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>Even though described as &#x27;professional&#x27;, these were not that great.  </li>
      <li>that really helps you have a good grip.  </li>
      <li>Now they are made from junk metal and the handles break easily.  </li>
      <li>Looks and feels strong.</li>
      <li>Item is great, exactly as described and very prompt shipping</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for offering my honest opinion of the product.</li>
      <li>Works great, beats the cheap ones I always got from the local stores.</li>
      <li>You can check the offerings by &amp;#34;Body Toolz&amp;#34; available on Amazon.com for a nail file that might suit your purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I was provided a free sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Another nice feature is that the curve on both the fingernail and the toenail clippers is a smaller radius than most, meaning you don&#x27;t have to make as many cuts to get the shorter fingernail shape correct.</li>
      <li>: I received a free sample for the purposes of review.</li>

      <li>They don&#x27;t have that awesome clean crisp feel that I expected.</li>
      <li>I have 4 kids ranging in ages and these were perfect for their small fingers.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent set of nail clippers that far outperforms similar clippers I have purchased at the drugstore.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They cut precisely, cleanly and evenly.</li>
      <li>They cut cleanly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very easy to grip both levers for a steady hand-hold.  </li>
      <li>They are sharp and precise - they work great, that&#x27;s the bottom line.</li>
      <li>The large clippers give me more leverage and it is easier to cut thicker nails.</li>
      <li>larger of these clippers work good on toenails.</li>
      <li>With a brushed metal surface they feel good when you hold them and the cut-outs in the handles</li>
      <li>These are nice and strong, aligned properly, and don&#x27;t require a lot of effort to cut.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve had dozens of pairs of cheap clippers over the years, so I was interested in seeing the difference between those and these &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The blades are gently curved and super-sharp to make clean cuts without crushing or tearing.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These clippers are solidly made out of stainless steel, are sharp and cut smoothly.  The large oval hole in the handle helps to keep my thumb from slipping off when I&#x27;m clipping.  They are obviously much better made and sharper than several chrome plated clippers that I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package that contained these clippers, sent to me as review samples, promises a &amp;#34;Guaranteed Lifetime Warranty 100% Satisfaction.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s difficult to comprehend how anyone could expect a warranty better than that.  My only complaint, and it&#x27;s a minor one, is that neither clipper has a built-in or built-on nail file.  Although the sharp cutters don&#x27;t leave ragged nails, my clipping is usually followed by some light filing to smooth any irregular clips that I might have made.  With these clippers I&#x27;ll need a separate nail file or emery board to perform the next step in my manicure.  Perhaps that&#x27;s characteristic of &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; clippers and I&#x27;m accustomed to the amateur ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the obvious quality construction and machining of these clippers the price for them is reasonable, making them easy to recommend.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had dozens of pairs of cheap clippers over the years, so I was interested in seeing the difference between those and these &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed, and actually didn&#x27;t know that better quality clippers even existed.  The smaller set clipped fingernails neatly and almost effortlessly, and the larger set worked just as well on tougher toenails - even my son&#x27;s thick, super-hard big toenails.  They&#x27;re very sharp, precision stainless steel with comfortable non-slip handles, and they look a lot more stylish than the ones I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re quite a bit more expensive than the pairs I&#x27;ve bought in the past, but I can tell they&#x27;re made to last and they certainly do clip nails better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary set of D&amp;M nail clippers, for testing and review purposes.  I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for offering my honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same clipper for my fingernails for years, possibly since the nineties, but the small clipper in this set will replace it. Both clippers in this set seem to be of very high quality and are sharper than any clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. (I take it for granted that nail clipper blades dull over time, but it&#x27;s certainly a plus that when new, the blades on these are as sharp as they are.) I like the design, both in terms of appearance and ergonomics. The springiness of these clippers is quite pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good clippers, especially for my fingernails, are important to me. I like to keep my fingernails pretty short, mainly because I&#x27;m always doing physical stuff and if my nails aren&#x27;t short they break and get snagged, etc. (I broke a nail in the nineties that has never healed, a split that goes a bit down one nail, and I always have to put clear nail polish on it to protect it from catching things and getting worse.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers do not have nail files attached to them, which suits me because I don&#x27;t like metal nail files, only the emery board kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger of these clippers work good on toenails. I can get a little excited about fingernail clippers, but not at all about toenail clippers. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for good quality nail clippers, I can easily recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample set of these for review purposes. I had no idea how mediocre the old fingernail clipper I&#x27;d been using for years if not decades was till I used the small clipper in this set to clip my fingernails.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was looking for the BEST. so sick of cheap Chinese clippers.  They don&#x27;t have that awesome clean crisp feel that I expected.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent set of nail clippers that far outperforms similar clippers I have purchased at the drugstore.  I have 4 kids ranging in ages and these were perfect for their small fingers.  I also very carefully trim my own toenails as a runner - I have to keep the cuts straight and careful so I don&#x27;t get ingrown nails or splits that could impact my ability to race.  These clippers make a nice clean cut, and the slots in the handle make it easy to not slip.  I was a bit questioning by the packaging, but these are a great product and highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a free sample for the purposes of review.</li>
    <li> Besst clippers I&#x27;ve had</li>
    <li> Hi quality ... very sharp. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> DuQu&amp;eacute;, sold by D &amp; M INNOVATION, has created a set of nail clippers - one large clipper for use on toes, and one small clipper for use on hands - that are made of the finest high grade brushed stainless steel. While there are many such clippers on the market, few I have ever tried have as sharp, clean cutting edge as these clippers. Another often over looked feature is in the way the clippers are design - there are spaces in the handle portion so that they don&#x27;t slip our of you moist hand when cutting your nails. Safety is a concern with this company and they have paid attention to that fact in designing these very fine clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence. This set is excellent. Grady Harp, January 15</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned more than a few cheap nail clippers and these do not qualify as cheap. They feel solid in my hand. They cut cleanly. I like the flat finish, which lends an air of sophistication to something that doesn&#x27;t beg sophistication. The toenail clipper doesn&#x27;t have a nail file onboard, but I&#x27;m not missing it. Nice nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Duque Beauty.</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers!  There are two features I look for in a nail clipper:  The precision of the cutting blades, and how easy it is to grip and manipulate the &amp;#34;handles&amp;#34;.  (What do you call them?)  This pair is all I could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting blades on both the large and small clipper meet each other perfectly, and the cutting blades are sharp and make a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to grip both levers for a steady hand-hold.  Both the large and the small clipper have a top lever has a curve/depression that allows my thumb to settle in securely.  They also have a nice weight:  Not too heavy, but not lightweight either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature that may not be important to you, but is to me:  It has a totally different look from most clippers.  Its distinctive look allows everyone in the family to know these are MINE.  I don&#x27;t like using other people&#x27;s clippers, and I don&#x27;t like them using mine.  Just a hygiene thing, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from D&amp;M Innovation.</li>
    <li> ,It is a rare day that I throw anything away. As a matter of fact if it were not for my wife I could probably be classified as a grade 2 hoarder. I share this wretched flaw in my personality with you so that you can understand why I have a very large shoebox filled with nail clippers going back for 50 some odd years. The only reason I have them is that my wife is always too busy throwing away many of my other &#x60;treasures.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, another three sets of clippers just hit that old box. These clippers by DuQue are beyond a doubt the best set I have ever owned. They are extremely sharp and actually cut the nail rather than crushing it. The design of the grips is absolutely wonderful. I can actually use my left hand and manipulate these things...never had a set I could do this with such ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spring action is excellent and I love the finish on these things. There will be none of the corrosion that normally occurs with those cheapo sets you buy at the local store. These things are made of high quality stainless steel with a very attractive buff finish to them. The curve of the cutting blades is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the life of me I cannot find anything to whine about when it comes to these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers were provided in exchange for an honest review but I can assure you that should these things go missing I will actually order another set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:137c5bcc072b79349a9dee8d2ca02bae]] This is a set of two nail clippers. The large one is 3.25\\&quot; long, 9/16\\&quot; wide at the cutting end and open 1/8\\&quot;. The small ones are 2.5\\&quot; long, 1/2\\&quot; wide at the cutting end, and open just under 1/8\\&quot;. The large clippers give me more leverage and it is easier to cut thicker nails. The smaller ones are a little easier to get into corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are made out of stainless steel. The blades are quite sharp. The big clippers did well on toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these clippers from the manufacturer with a request for an honest review whether it happens to be positive or negative. Overall, I like them - they work well, I don&#x27;t need to do \\&quot;double takes\\&quot; when I cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;m bummed because I really liked these clippers, but I was using the big one the other day and it popped to pieces!  The post snapped off and now it&#x27;s unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: Wow!  I never thought I&#x27;d be impressed by nail clippers, but this set should become the standard by which others are judged.  They are extremely solid and have substantial weight to them.  With a brushed metal surface they feel good when you hold them and the cut-outs in the handles give them a little style (and probably keep them from being too heavy.)  The cutting blades are sharp and precise.  I get the impression that these are going to last a long, long time (not like the last drugstore one I bought that literally fell to pieces in my hand after about a month.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these as a sample and this review is my absolutely honest and rather enthusiastic opinion... This is really an excellent set of clippers! (I seldom rave like this about a product and I almost never give five stars.)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I am all that impressed. They actually flex too much for them to give a snap like cut. I ended up going back to my trusty Revlons to finish the job and gained a new appreciation for them.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are indeed professional quality, incomparable to the inexpensive ones sold at the register in stores. The small clippers are 2 1/2 in long and weigh 0.8 oz. while the large pair are 3 1/4 in. long and weigh 1.6 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made of thick, brushed stainless steel. The blades are gently curved and super-sharp to make clean cuts without crushing or tearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles and the bases curve at the end and are perforated for a good grip. The long handles provide excellent leverage for cutting even thickened nails easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D &amp; M Innovation provided clippers for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Clippers were too dull to use.  Threw them in the trash rather than trying to return them.</li>
    <li> I would have thought these would have been a little sharper.</li>
    <li> it cuts your nail irregular, and very hard to use, and very expensive.</li>
    <li> An attractive set of masculine-styled stainless clippers. A nice weight and heft. These feel substantial and well crafted, right out of the box. There&#x27;s a pleasant texture to the steel finish. They feel good in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cut precisely, cleanly and evenly. These are NOT the usual economy clippers by the checkout register at Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitate to call nail clippers &#x27;elegant&#x27;....but....these are really awfully nice. &#x27;Pretty swank&#x27;, said my cousin admiringly when she saw them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent clippers. They look good, feel good, and work perfectly. These are upscale clippers. What more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample sent for testing and impartial review. My whole family loves these. Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful as you comparison shop online. Happy travels, everybody.</li>
    <li> Finally, nail clippers of quality! Designed to do the job great.</li>
    <li> The toenail clipper is fine, but the smaller fingernail clipper isn&#x27;t very well made. The cutter was mis-ground so the jaws don&#x27;t line up and make a messy cut. And there&#x27;s no file to clean up after that messy cut.</li>
    <li> This a great tool for triming your nails.You should trim&lt;br /&gt; your nails after a shower when your nails are soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy from this vendor again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanking you in advance,&lt;br /&gt;Vincent Garcia</li>
    <li> Not sharp at all.  Leaves jagged edges. Not good at all.  Would not recommend</li>
    <li> This nail clipper set is very well made from heavy duty stainless steel and feels like it will last a lifetime. The blades are sharp and it’s easy to use to get a clean accurate cut. The brushed finish provides a good grip and leverage, so cutting finger or toe nails is easy. Having two sizes in the pack is great value, nice product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:734a0e5aba1c0a24c15242169c863097]] This is a review of the Du Qu&amp;eacute; stainless steel nail clipper set. I was provided a free sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought were bought while travelling and are the cheapest things ever. They all had a chrome finish they have all rusted over time. The handles usually fall out of the slot that makes them work when I&#x27;m using them making them a pain in the butt to  use. Just complete garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first set of nail clippers I&#x27;ve had that I can honestly say seem to be of really good quality. They&#x27;re made of brushed stainless steel. They look as nice as a nail clipper could look I think. The stainless steel is thicker than what I&#x27;ve seen on my other clippers so it&#x27;s unlikely these will bend. And they&#x27;re sharp. What more could a nail clipper be?</li>
    <li> Best best BEST clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned and used. I hide them from my wife and kids. They always lose stuff. I still love them, but... MAN They lose stuff! I wish there was a remember pill here on Amazon. Maybe I&#x27;ll buy some of those memory vitamins and grind them up into our food. I cannot stand the thought of losing these clippers just because the dirty little urchins refuse the leave their cotton picking hands off my stuff. MY CLIPPERS! Mine!</li>
    <li> I have a much older, much cheaper clipper that does just as well.</li>
    <li> Thought it was a great deal to get 2.  Nice quality and metal.  The small clipper cut very nice.  However, was disappointed the large did not cut well.  It couldn&#x27;t cut the nail on my large toe.  Was like my nails were made of steel.  I pressed all the way down and it just wouldn&#x27;t cut.  Had to return it.  Would buy the small one if they sold it separately.</li>
    <li> EASIER TO HOLD THE REGULAR CLIPPERS--GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Only used them once so far. They are sharp and have a good grip and cut well.......but a long way to go to see how much better they are.</li>
    <li> First pair I received was dull but they sent me a replacement and it is great!</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for...heavy duty....</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I had to go searching for high quality nail clippers.  The typical ones in the local stores always seemed fine until recently.  Now they are made from junk metal and the handles break easily.  I broke two pairs within months without trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are high quality and very sharp.  I&#x27;ll probably have these for rest of my life.  I wish they had a nail file built-in, but I knew that they didn&#x27;t when I purchased them.  My wife laughed at me when she saw how happy I was to received these.  I think she was happy too, but wouldn&#x27;t admit it!  :)</li>
    <li> The material is very good. Looks and feels strong. Only problem for me is that the cutting edge is too flat. If you have a short nail, it&#x27;s hard to reach, because the edge is blocked by finger tip. This is the only but serious design flaw to me. Other good clippers have a more protruding cutting edge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of a nail clipper connoisseur and collector. These are good clippers, definitely above average. But my favorite everyday clippers are still the Seki Edge. For a very cool, ultra-compact, and very sharp clipper look at the &amp;#34;Zwilling J.A. Henckels Ultra-Slim Nail Clipper&amp;#34;. Both are sold on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Finally, a pair of nail clippers that are solid and functional!</li>
    <li> These are ok. They are pretty sharp but hard to push down.</li>
    <li> These D&amp;M Pro nail clippers have a good grip. The sharp blades give a smooth cut. I especially like the leverage from the long handle on the toe nail clippers.</li>
    <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut better than any other clippers I have used. Definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> The cut outs on this prevent it from slipping and the cutters are very shape, compare to Trim.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey but they are sturdy and work well.</li>
    <li> I bought these to clip my cats&#x27; claws. I found that regular clippers would slip in my fingers.  These don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what a professional Nail Clipper looks like but I have bought dozens of nail clippers before and I know how a good one is supposed to perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Cutting effort - It does not take much effort to cut my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Grip - This the first Nail clipper I have ever had that had both the cutter and the lever having a wide end for a better grip and more leverage and have slots as well that really helps you have a good grip.  I felt confident that my grip will not slip unlike my older nail clipper that I have dropped several times because they were so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  2 Clippers - It comes with a small cutter and a larger one.  Perfect for small fingernails and adult fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I wish it had a clipping catcher like the older one I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts very well and has a non slip handle.  It looks like it will last a long time, and it has a lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> BUY BUY BUY BUY  BUY BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Worked as expected,  will update with use</li>
    <li> When pressing down on the handle to clip fingernails the blades did only a partial cut and left the nail jagged and broken.</li>
    <li> Really solid and sharp. Best clippers I have found by far.</li>
    <li> They fit very comfortably in your hand and easy to hold.  A little bit expensive, but they should last a long time.</li>
    <li> What I DON&#x27;T like about this product: They are missing the metal filer that most clippers have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like:&lt;br /&gt;* Aesthetics: A great modern twist to the design - both look great. As far as looks goes, these are the nicest clippers I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;* Material: They made of stainless steel, and have a matte, brushed look. They are not shiny to attract smudges and fingerprints. Both are made of quality material, and feel sturdy and hefty in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;* Size: The set contains two sizes. Since we don&#x27;t have little ones at home, we use the small one for our fingers, and the big one for our toes.&lt;br /&gt;* Functionality: The ultimate question - how good are they? They are sharp and precise - they work great, that&#x27;s the bottom line. Also, the holes at the end of the lever allow your thumb to set/rest in them so your thumb doesn&#x27;t slip around during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an excellent and quality set of nail clippers. The small niggle about not having a metal filer is offset by the material and quality/functionality. Being made of high-grade steel, the clippers themselves will last you for many years. It remains to be seen about the longevity of their sharpness, so I will update again if these become dull too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always rate the item with the price in mind, because nowadays that is a key factor in deciding what you buy and whether you buy that one, or something else. I feel they worth $15-25, since you are getting two clippers, and are definitely recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A SAMPLE WAS SENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF MY OBJECTIVE EVALUATION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I have worked very hard to achieve the ranking I have now. I am very grateful to all the people who have trusted my reviews over the years and have voted positively on my reviews. Therefore, I will ALWAYS state at the very top if I received the item complimentary from the vendor, and what I DON&#x27;T like about the product(if any) before I write about the things I do like. Thank you, everyone, and have an awesome 2015!**</li>
    <li> Nicely built and sharp!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for better quality toenail and fingernail clippers than you&#x27;ll find at the local supermarket or chain store, then theses are the clippers for you. These stainless steel clippers are well built, very sharp, and easy to grip. You get two different sized clippers that will work on the biggest toes to the smallest fingers. Currently priced at around $15 for both of them, they are priced right. The clippers have a unique and modern look too. I recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Vendor supplied product for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Some nail clippers are really basic, others have a high end finish and feel. These fall in the later category. They are beautifully finished and feel great. The cutouts help to add grip when using them. They are super sharp and easy to use. There is no point end for cleaning underneath though, something that you see on other nail clippers. I can say that these just feel and look like high quality products. Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Made of stainless steel to prevent rust and corrosion, this nail clipper set is made to last for a while.  Unlike the cheap sets you get at retail stores where the handle wiggles and your thumb slips out, these are meant to have a firm hold in your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges are sharp and strong to give you the clean sharp cut.  It is has a curved cutting angle to give you a more natural cut instead of straight blunt cut.  The cut-out holes and slants give you a firmer hold on the handle so your finger does not slip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are so good at cutting, be extra careful because they can go through skin just as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample.</li>
    <li> Good quality clippers. Not cheap stuff. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Summary: Good clipper set for the family.  Note: Free item provided for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have 5 in our family, ranging from our 6 year old with super thin nails to me, with finger and toenails as thick as graham crackers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually broken regular clippers trying to clip my thumbnails or toenails.  I&#x27;ve been banished to using a pair of dedicated toenail clippers.  Those were straight line cutters - this set comes with a set of curved toenail clippers which does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being made from heavy gauge, brushed stainless steel, these clippers are very sharp and leave a precise edge.  That&#x27;s nice because it minimizes the amount of filing to get a smooth edge.  Another nice feature is that the curve on both the fingernail and the toenail clippers is a smaller radius than most, meaning you don&#x27;t have to make as many cuts to get the shorter fingernail shape correct.</li>
    <li> Nice nail clippers. Worked well on fingers and toes (small and big fingers). No issues. Looks nice. Hope no rusts over period of time.  Sample was sent in exchange of a fair review.</li>
    <li> Works great, beats the cheap ones I always got from the local stores.</li>
    <li> Item is great, exactly as described and very prompt shipping</li>
    <li> buy this and stop buying the junky stuff! This works great, cuts well and no hang nails!</li>
    <li> These are nice and strong, aligned properly, and don&#x27;t require a lot of effort to cut. I also like the cut-out design and brushed nickel look, setting them apart a little bit from generic-looking clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprised that a file was not included. Those metal files are never great, but they&#x27;ll do in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this set for review.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST nail clippers we have owned. Features to love about them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* cuts accurately ~ sharp enough to cut through nails on the first try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* cuts easily ~ more leverage due to angle of handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* grips handily ~ easy to hold - doesn&#x27;t slip-slide around - due to width of handle and holes in handle, especially the round thumb hole&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* light-weight - because it&#x27;s wider, the weight seems better distributed across and doesn&#x27;t feel as heavy in your hand as our other clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* rust-proof ~ stainless steel material&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* family packet ~ comes with smaller clipper set for smaller toes and fingers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* life-time guarantee ~ you never need to buy another set again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* attractive appearance ~ just looks better than most clippers which look to me like small instruments of torture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are professional grade, salon type and have an ergonomic design says the company. They exceeded our expectations. They would make a great gift - small birthday gift or stocking stuffer - for a family member. As often as nails have to be clipped, it&#x27;s convenient to have something this firm and precise to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(review sample provided)</li>
    <li> These well-designed nail clippers made of higher-grade brushed steel have an aesthetically pleasing appearance and their hefty feel when held in the hand creates an expectation of quality that is fully met during routine daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not the type of lightweight clippers with a chrome finish that are usually available for purchase in most retail outlets; the term &amp;#34;professional nail clippers&amp;#34; definitely applies. When comparing these with run-of-the-mill nail clippers that I received for free when purchasing some Tineacide (nail fungus remedy) a few months ago, the greater weight and more substantial nature of these DuQu&amp;eacute; nail clippers are immediately noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do these stainless steel clippers provide better ergonomics during actuation, especially with the off-hand - as another reviewer already has mentioned, but the fact that the lever has openings and is not one solid piece significantly reduces the risk of the clippers inadvertently slipping out of your hand during use. The risk of this happening is even greater in all variations of cheaper clippers with a smooth (as in slippery!) chrome finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These stainless steel clippers are sharp and cut fingernails and toenails exceedingly well: You do in fact get two top-quality clippers (one smaller and one larger, but otherwise identical) in the package precisely for this purpose at a cost of about $20.00 for the pair. This is a reasonable price since both of the clippers provided are bound to last a very long time indeed and you are also given the assurance of a &amp;#34;100% Satisfaction Lifetime Warranty&amp;#34; by the manufacturer. Now what could be better than that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have mentioned the absence of a slide-out small nail file that some models of nail clippers have. This is not a deficiency in my opinion; you will clearly be better served by purchasing these fine, top-quality clippers and combining them with a separate dedicated nail file of your choosing. You can check the offerings by &amp;#34;Body Toolz&amp;#34; available on Amazon.com for a nail file that might suit your purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any nails (especially exceptionally thick toenails!) that cannot be successfully processed with either one of these fine clippers, I can recommend the following items available on Amazon.com: &amp;#34;Body Toolz Ingrown Toenail Clipper&amp;#34; (see my review) which is definitely not just for ingrown toenails at a cost of about $10.00 or the &amp;#34;Body Toolz Springless Ingrown Toenail Clipper&amp;#34; - approximately $20.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this pair of toenail clippers is an essential item of regular use that is well worth purchasing and I consider myself to be most fortunate in having been given a complimentary sample by the manufacturer for this hopefully unbiased review.r choosing.

    <li> Even though described as &#x27;professional&#x27;, these were not that great.  Just okay and nothing to write home about.  In fact the smaller one came apart on first use (but easily put together again).</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve bought anything like this, they are superior in construction to the ubiquitous Trim branded products I usually have used. Because they have a longer and broader lever, they seem easier to control. They&#x27;re also pretty sharp, so care must be taken to just get the nail and not the surrounding tissue into their grip. Not the transcendent experience I was expecting, but definitely a superior device for nail cutting. Longevity to be determined. Non-chromed stainless steel.</li>
