      <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will work.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be better</li>
      <li>I had chemically burned off my hair... and most products, including Rogaine, say that can not work on hair that has been chemically removed...</li>
      <li>and I can promise you my edges and the top of my head</li>
      <li>This seems to be helping my scalp feel and look better.</li>
      <li>I am sure it helps, but does have a scent to it.</li>
      <li>I searched for anything that would heal this itching and re-establish a healthy scalp.  </li>
      <li>This product is pretty good and it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into my scalp easily.</li>
      <li>I will strongly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I even use a little bit on the rest of my hair to define my curls and it works great!</li>
      <li>Overall really great product line.</li>
      <li>To be honest I haven&#x27;t used this as much as I would like to yet</li>
      <li>This product isn&#x27;t cheap either.</li>
      <li>Did not notice a significant change.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to keep using this product.</li>
      <li>this product is great, I have been using is for about a month and my sides have grown back in a whole lot.</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t provide any help to my condition and I would not recommend it for a bold spot treatment.</li>
      <li>Order came quickly, I just started using this with the hair loss shampoo.</li>
      <li>But was very surprised how fast and nicely my bald spot  grow in.</li>
      <li>had dyed my hair like 5 times in one week, I really wanted the colour on the box lol, and afterwards I noticed certain areas of my head, especially my hairline, was missing a great deal of hair.</li>
      <li>after a few months, maybe about 3, with this one I saw some fuzz lol.  </li>
      <li>after a few months, maybe about 3, with this one I saw some fuzz lol.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it is all natural products.  </li>
      <li>Now I feel comfortable wearing a pulled back hairdo. :)</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;ve noticed that there is more fine hair on the hairline than before and the crown is showing less scalp.</li>
      <li>But the scalp was absolutely damaged!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using bald spot treatment irregularly since the first of this year.</li>
      <li>during the first 15 days I was putting it on once a day.</li>
      <li>Put in the scalp bald spots and that very day i used it, the itching stopped!  </li>
      <li>I thinking some hair coming back , I need to give it more time.</li>
      <li>Please make the company aware of our concerns and the damage to our hair.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it for a while to see if there is more growth in the next two months.</li>
      <li>So in the second 15 I putted twice a day (including rubbing it for 4-5 mins) as specifically described on their official website and as most users recommended.</li>
      <li>And I am glad I did, since using this I have noticed that my hair has indeed begun to grow back in the areas where I use this.</li>
      <li>love it, worth every penny i spent.</li>
      <li>I am able to really apply Bald Spot Treatment every morning to all of the critical spots</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure results vary from person to person because not everyone&#x27;s hair grows at the same rate, my hair has always grown fast...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure results vary from person to person because not everyone&#x27;s hair grows at the same rate, my hair has always grown fast...</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>As the ingredients are pure herbal.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how much I believe in this product.</li>
      <li>I will make additional purchases very soon.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>So much so that friends have asked me the name of the product so that they too can purchase it, because they remember the way I would point out and cry over my bald patches and how now I have hair there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it, because it&#x27;s doing more than what I expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not seen much results using this product, but will continue until the jar is gone.  </li>
      <li>So much that when I put my hand to it, I felt skin, not hair.</li>
      <li>I can say this didn&#x27;t seem to do much and</li>
      <li>Now I feel comfortable wearing a pulled back hairdo.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing braids and weaves since 1987 and now I am 40, so the years of tension really did a number of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Fast service all as promised</li>
      <li>I REALLY DON&#x27;T SEE  NEW HAIR GROWTH.  </li>
      <li>This particular product was a bit tricky to wash out of the hair around my patchy alopecia.</li>
      <li>This is a good product, but in my case I didn&#x27;t see the as much growth in the thin spots of my hair that I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Wow this really work as you massage into your scalp</li>
      <li>YET  WILL GIVE IT A FEW MORE WEEKS.  </li>
      <li>I stop using it a few weeks ago just to make sure it was the product.  </li>
      <li>And I took a photo after 30 days same angle, same light.</li>
      <li>I begun using it last August, I originally bought it from the company&#x27;s website, and the one jar lasted me till about Jan of this year, and than I purchased another here from Amazon, and I still have the same jar to this day.</li>
      <li>This product was like wow!</li>
      <li>Now that I went totally natural</li>
      <li>So far i have seen some improvement in my hair line; will keep using it.</li>
      <li>so someone else might see results in 4/5 months rather than 3... but results will come as long as you stay consistent and don&#x27;t give up.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when I discovered just natural.</li>
      <li>so someone else might see results in 4/5 months rather than 3... but results will come as long as you stay consistent and don&#x27;t give up.</li>

      <li>/&gt;The minor bold spot is the same.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i read the purpose in using the product on the JustNatural Organic website. I have dreadlocks.  About 3 months ago I had my sylist wrap my dreads in a 100% knotty dread human hair. It was great, gave my dreadlocks more fullness.  A of a sudden my scalp began itching profusely.  I used neutrogena&#x27;s T/Gel. That did not stop the itching.  In June the itching became so unbearable I decided to cut the extensions out.  Surprisingly, my natural dreads seemed to have be come extremely thin but grew. But the scalp was absolutely damaged!  Like bald spots, the dreads was not damaged except that they were thin.  I searched for anything that would heal this itching and re-establish a healthy scalp.  This product was like wow! Put in the scalp bald spots and that very day i used it, the itching stopped!  I will continue using just this product on my scalp until the area begins to grow hair, but to  not have that irritating itching, 50% of the product guarantee done. and the product is so lite and absorbs in the scalp without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;thanks JustNatural.</li>
    <li> I used this product 2 times only because it leaves my hair very dirty. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and the next day after using it, it was greasy and gross. For me it was not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any thing different its been a little over a month</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a bald spot, but I figured it could not hurt to try it to see if it smelled good, and did something?  I only used it once, so it was not something I chose to use again...this is not to say that for some who keep using it would not see a difference, but unfortunately I cannot address these concerns...&lt;br /&gt;Elle</li>
    <li> at first I was skeptical whether it would work for me because I have PCOS But was very surprised how fast and nicely my bald spot  grow in. I definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This was my 3rd order!  I have seen results in just a few months.  My part was widening and now is almost back to normal.  It also is great for people who suffer from itchy scalp.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t grow hair at all.... Still got bald spot and would not buy this product if I had read the reviews!!!!!</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I would recommend it as well with a dose of patiente; it does not happen in a day; give it couple of weeks. So far i have seen some improvement in my hair line; will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Shipping time was good. Can&#x27;t finish it because it caused a rash on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t consider writing a review until I used it for 30 days. during the first 15 days I was putting it on once a day. But there were no improvements. So in the second 15 I putted twice a day (including rubbing it for 4-5 mins) as specifically described on their official website and as most users recommended. There were No results No improvements. I even take a photo before the treatment. Since the eyes of the self can&#x27;t judge well. And I took a photo after 30 days same angle, same light. To see if there were any difference but Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minor bold spot is the same. This product didn&#x27;t provide any help to my condition and I would not recommend it for a bold spot treatment. However I would recommend it for people who like healthy herbal creams. As the ingredients are pure herbal.</li>
    <li> Seems to keep hair from falling out as long as you are using it.</li>
    <li> Got the expired product. VERY disappointed.</li>
    <li> My wife is having a small size of bald spot, now she is using this product and it seem like its working.</li>
    <li> I use several just natural products as a  part of my hair care and facial care regimen. I began losing hair several years ago as a result of meds and hormone imbalance issues. That&#x27;s when I discovered just natural. I&#x27;ve been using bald spot treatment irregularly since the first of this year. I didnt expect it to regrow hair. I bought it to camouflage those thinning areas. The formula causes the hair to crinkle at the root,  giving the appearance of thicker, fuller hair. I use it on the crown, and the edges. Well, I&#x27;ve noticed that there is more fine hair on the hairline than before and the crown is showing less scalp. I think it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ll keep using it, because it&#x27;s doing more than what I expected.</li>
    <li> I brought this product to grow my edges back, so far nothing has happend. I must admit that I don&#x27;t use it often, however I am still going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> This cream did not work. my hair is still the same.  How do I get a refund for this expensive product?</li>
    <li> Wow this really work as you massage into your scalp you feel a cool feeling less than 2 wks I see hair growth. Maybe for the price the retailer should increase the size of the product.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t seem to work. I was not really impressed. Quite disappointed.My hair got really dry, so I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I want to start by saying that I have always been skeptical about products that advertise growing your hair back; however at this point in my life I was desperate to find something to aid in growing back my edges and this terrible bald spot in the top of my head. I have been wearing braids and weaves since 1987 and now I am 40, so the years of tension really did a number of my hair.  I have traction alopecia from al that pulling and my edges were so bald, they almost had a shine to them.  Anyrate, I can honestly say that this product in conjuction with the organic care hair loss shampoo and conditioner for thinning hair has worked WONDERS for my hair.  I have used the shampoo and conditioner once  a week for the last 3 week and I use the bald spot treatment every day and I can promise you my edges and the top of my head is filling in.  No, there is no extremely long hair in these places, but my edges; while still are thin, they aren&#x27;t so thin any more that my temple area seems to shine.  I will strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Have used everyday for 6 weeks w/o success! Did not regrow hair at temple or crown. However, great moisturizer &amp; seems to condition scalp. Like that it has all natural ingredients. A little pricey, but debating whether to purchase again for these properties</li>
    <li> Date: May 28, 2015.  &amp;#34;  I begin using the product on March  28 and also allowed my daughter to use it as well so that we could benefit from the results.  It took a while before I notice the product was taking my hair out and not making it grow as it claimed it would do.  I stop using it a few weeks ago just to make sure it was the product.  Now my hair has stop shedding, but there are areas in my scalp where the product removed the hair completely, especially around the temple aera.  My daughter notice it several weeks ago and stop using the product when she notice her hair was falling out. Please make the company aware of our concerns and the damage to our hair. Thank you, Dr. Mary McCoy and Daughter.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with all of the products purchased. I will make additional purchases very soon. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t seen results yet</li>
    <li> I REALLY DON&#x27;T SEE  NEW HAIR GROWTH.  NOT HAPPY YET  WILL GIVE IT A FEW MORE WEEKS.  IF NOTHING HAPPENS WHAT DO  I DO?</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for me used for about 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for a month now and have not noticed any difference on my bald spots.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t see this help grow hair in anyway.  It did act as a wonderful conditioner for my hair.  If all I want is that, I might buy it again.</li>
    <li> IT IS A GOOD TREATMENT FOR THE HAIR, I WILL BUY MORE IF I HAVE TO BUY MORE OK .</li>
    <li> I have alopecia all round my hair line (front, sides, around ears and the nape of the back).  I started using Bald Spot Treatment off and on with my weave and saw little results.  Now that I went totally natural I am able to really apply Bald Spot Treatment every morning to all of the critical spots and I see great improvement.  You have to stick with the product for it to be successful.  Some people have to use it a little longer than some people but if you be diligent in your routine, you will see results.  I did.  I have now purchase my second jar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for the resuls on this product.  Will let you know.</li>
    <li> it did not work at all!!! i just finally threw it away this year</li>
    <li> I am sure it helps, but does have a scent to it.</li>
    <li> I have seen a difference in my hair that thinned due to traction alopecia and I must say this is the only product that has allowed me to see a visible change and I love that it is all natural products.  I was not looking for a miracle, but I definitely seen results within 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Order came quickly, I just started using this with the hair loss shampoo. It feels nice on my scalp, I like the smell it&#x27;s very soothing. I even use a little bit on the rest of my hair to define my curls and it works great! I&#x27;m excited to keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Used it on my edges twice per day for several months.  Did not notice a significant change.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he has zero results!! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I have been using thiss everyday and nothing is happening. Will not purchase it again.  Not as expected did not work</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good and it doesn&#x27;t smell. It seems to be working because I still have hair on my head.</li>
    <li> I consider this to be one of the best products for addressing bald spots.  It is not greasy and blends well into the scalp.</li>
    <li> Okay so I have tried Rogaine and all sorts of stuff to help regrow your hair and nothing worked until I tried this. My friend recommended it and I was still doubtful about it, but I decided to try it anyway. And I am glad I did, since using this I have noticed that my hair has indeed begun to grow back in the areas where I use this. I had chemically burned off my hair... and most products, including Rogaine, say that can not work on hair that has been chemically removed... well this does.&lt;br /&gt;I had dyed my hair like 5 times in one week, I really wanted the colour on the box lol, and afterwards I noticed certain areas of my head, especially my hairline, was missing a great deal of hair. So much that when I put my hand to it, I felt skin, not hair. Freaked me out enough that I had begun to wear wigs to cover that embarrassing bald spots.&lt;br /&gt;When my friend mentioned this product, I decided it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try, and I am SO glad I did! I begun using it last August, I originally bought it from the company&#x27;s website, and the one jar lasted me till about Jan of this year, and than I purchased another here from Amazon, and I still have the same jar to this day. I use it once a day on three different areas and when I put it on, I no longer feel skin, but actual hair. My hair has begun to grow back. I didn&#x27;t expect overnight results because no one&#x27;s hair grows that fast, but honestly I didn&#x27;t expect any results either, and I am happy to say that it is indeed working. So much so that friends have asked me the name of the product so that they too can purchase it, because they remember the way I would point out and cry over my bald patches and how now I have hair there. I even just ordered one for a male friend who has begun to lose hair in the crown of his hair. I believe it will stop his premature hair loss. That&#x27;s how much I believe in this product. But don&#x27;t take my word for it, give it a go yourself. Just remember, it&#x27;s not going to be overnight results, and you might not see things within even a month, but don&#x27;t stop, keep using it because it works.&lt;br /&gt;I used Rogaine for months and never saw results... after a few months, maybe about 3, with this one I saw some fuzz lol.  I&#x27;m sure results vary from person to person because not everyone&#x27;s hair grows at the same rate, my hair has always grown fast... so someone else might see results in 4/5 months rather than 3... but results will come as long as you stay consistent and don&#x27;t give up. Trust me, I HATED seeing my bald hair line. I always had to wear my hair down, or a wig, to cover it up. Now I feel comfortable wearing a pulled back hairdo. :)not see things within even a month, but don&#x27;t stop, keep using it because it works.&lt;br /&gt;I used Rogaine for months and never saw results... after a few months, maybe about 3, with this one I saw some fuzz lol.

    <li> To be honest I haven&#x27;t used this as much as I would like to yet but I&#x27;m sure it will work. It&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> This product line is wonderful. This particular product was a bit tricky to wash out of the hair around my patchy alopecia. Overall really great product line.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re all looking for the cure. But this isn&#x27;t it. If you want to feel like you&#x27;re doing something, buy it. But don&#x27;t hold your breath. And be prepared for sticky hair/scalp.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet. I thinking some hair coming back , I need to give it more time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not seen much results using this product, but will continue until the jar is gone.  If there&#x27;s any change I&#x27;ll revise my review.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be better</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really works. I started seeing hair growth in less than 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ve been weaving my hair for years and my sides started falling out and some areas were balding.  Its a MUST have product.</li>
    <li> This rating was chosen because when I called the company to ask if these products were good for course african-american hair,&lt;br /&gt;the representative said yes, many african-american&#x27;s use their products. When I tried the product as directed, it made the texture&lt;br /&gt;of my hair worst.</li>
    <li> The bald spot treatment did not work for me.  I used this treatment for 2 months and saw no change in the spot at all.  This product isn&#x27;t cheap either. Expensive lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but in my case I didn&#x27;t see the as much growth in the thin spots of my hair that I was looking for.  I will continue to use it for a while to see if there is more growth in the next two months.</li>
    <li> This seems to be helping my scalp feel and look better. It absorbs into my scalp easily.</li>
    <li> I did not care for this product.  I did nothing for my thinning areas.  I would not recommend it for thinning or balding.</li>
    <li> i just hope it works.</li>
    <li> Fast service all as promised</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over a week and use it about 5 times a week. And hair started to grow on my bald spots. There are few rashes around my patch spots and I am not sure if that&#x27;s supposed to happen? It worked tho and I feel hopeful</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a balding spot i noticed on my head. I can say this didn&#x27;t seem to do much and it had a very strong odor to it. It was an odor that I personally wasn&#x27;t fond of. Overall not sure this product did much for me.</li>
    <li> this product is great, I have been using is for about a month and my sides have grown back in a whole lot. I have used it on my daughters sides and have seen great results. love it, worth every penny i spent.</li>
