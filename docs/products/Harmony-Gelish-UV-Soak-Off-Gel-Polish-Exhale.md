      <li>Nice for work and nice dates.  </li>
      <li>I bought all the equipment to do my own gel nails.  </li>
      <li>A nice neutral darkish mauve.  </li>

      <li>need I say more.  </li>
      <li>I change the color, and update my rating if looks better on my nails than on paper.</li>
      <li>The color is more of a peach rather than a mauve as it looks on the picture here.  </li>
      <li>I feel like this would be better in the spring.</li>
      <li>maybe that&#x27;s part of why I don&#x27;t love the color.</li>
      <li>This color is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a more &amp;#34;grown</li>
      <li>up&amp;#34; color for sure but not boring.</li>
      <li>shimmer to it at all.&lt;br /&gt;It would be prettier and more noticeable if it had shimmer.</li>
      <li>More pink/purple raisin colored.  </li>
      <li>My nails have grown and finally look really good all the time!!</li>
      <li>This is a lovely color.  </li>
      <li>Lovely color that goes on well.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty, and nicely represented by the photo provided by another customer.</li>
      <li>Love the color and the shipping was quick!</li>
      <li>Very true to the pic...</li>
      <li>Wow, what a beautiful color and the application goes on so smooth.</li>
      <li>It looks good with any color I wear - very versatile.</li>
      <li>(The wonderful part of gel polish is you can put regular polish on top and remove it with non-acetone remover for a special occasion or fun!)  </li>
      <li>The polish iteself is fine but the color is mis-leading.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, low maintenance and great results.</li>
      <li>Great coverage and lasting shine.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s light mauve.  </li>
      <li>Exhale is just a TAD bit lighter ---- in some light.  </li>
      <li>Also pretty with vegas nights on top for a bit of glitter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice creamy color that looks good on my pale skin.  </li>
      <li>It is neutral enough not to be too showy but makes your hands look good.  </li>
      <li>Color was true to the color shown.</li>
      <li>It is very flattering on and I have gotten more compliments on this Gelish color than the others I have tried before.  </li>
      <li>Arrived fast and love the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad color, just doesn&#x27;t look like the picture on line to me.</li>
      <li>so I mainly wear my pinkish colors the most out of gelish.</li>
      <li>This is just a lovely classic.</li>
      <li>It went on very easily and evenly and looked like a professional manicure.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t as dark as pictured, but still a great color.  </li>
      <li>I believe it&#x27;s just a bit lighter after it&#x27;s applied, but it&#x27;s still very pretty and covers well.</li>
      <li>It is a great everyday color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a purple mixed with with a light brown I say.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s right.  </li>
      <li>The picture looks more red to me, but it&#x27;s almost a true brown.</li>
      <li>Love the color - it&#x27;s my favorite - a little pricy.</li>
      <li>Creamy mauve, exactly what I was looking for: Samuri without the glitter.</li>
      <li>This was the first color I used after getting my UV lamp.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Good color for everyday.  </li>
      <li>Think dusty rose, but browner and more vintage-looking.</li>
      <li>I will use this color frequently as it is very versatile.</li>
      <li>I really like this color.  </li>
      <li>Very flattering and blends with whatever you are wearing.  </li>
      <li>It is very neutral -much lighter than the photo-brownish mauve.  </li>
      <li>I find it lasts really well for 10 days</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m much more of a PINK girl</li>
      <li>I really like this color.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very neutral, in a way.</li>
      <li>Is nice for everyday.</li>
      <li>I like it for a professional look and think has just the right amount of shine, no glitter.</li>
      <li>I like my nails to look classic and pretty but not plain.  </li>
      <li>I would put the color in the family of a light brownish pink.  </li>
      <li>The color swatches make you believe it is a dark color, but no matter how many coats you do it is not a dark color.</li>
      <li>So far, I recommend highly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more dusty rose than in the picture.</li>
      <li>and/or was old.</li>
      <li>the entire process of doing your own&lt;br /&gt;nails is very tricky.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s professional, though, and works for the office.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Is simply a dusty rose or mauve.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really neutral pink shade and it goes well with any skin tone.  </li>
      <li>It has a hint of brown in it, so it isn&#x27;t a real pinky pink.</li>
      <li>Again, like with any gelish polish make sure that you apply a thin coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my favorite gelish color.  It&#x27;s not as violet as the picture looked to me.  It&#x27;s a mauve/pink with a slight bit of brown.  Very flattering and blends with whatever you are wearing.  It&#x27;s not as sheer as other gelish light colors, which I like, but I still used 3 thin coats.  Also pretty with vegas nights on top for a bit of glitter.</li>
    <li> RULE OF THUMB FOR ALL GELISH COLORS: All colors are lighter then what you see on your computer. So picture this, but a shade lighter. If you buy it off the color you see, you will be disappointed as it won&#x27;t be the exact color. I like this color, it&#x27;s very neutral, in a way. It&#x27;s more of a purple mixed with with a light brown I say. Very different color but, I like. I&#x27;m much more of a PINK girl so I mainly wear my pinkish colors the most out of gelish.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a beautiful color and the application goes on so smooth. I will see how long it lasts.So far, I recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Love the color - it&#x27;s my favorite - a little pricy.</li>
    <li> I just love Gelish!! My nails have grown and finally look really good all the time!! I find it lasts really well for 10 days but I can get 14 good days from it!! This color is my favorite. Very true to the pic...some arent.</li>
    <li> This is a great color.  It&#x27;s a mauve-ish, pink-ishy, muted rose color.  It is a great everyday color. Although it&#x27;s not a neutral itself, it can be worn as a neutral.  I also received 2 compliments on the color as soon as I put it on. It isn&#x27;t as dark as pictured, but still a great color.  I recommend this color and Harmony Gelish products.  Easy to apply, low maintenance and great results.</li>
    <li> I really like this color.  It is very neutral -much lighter than the photo-brownish mauve.  It is rich &amp; opaque looking -great coverage.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to a nice pinkish mauve.  This is an awful orangy brown. I will try it next time I change the color, and update my rating if looks better on my nails than on paper.</li>
    <li> Even the color stripe on the bottle from Sally&#x27;s is way off.  I would put the color in the family of a light brownish pink.  The color swatches make you believe it is a dark color, but no matter how many coats you do it is not a dark color.</li>
    <li> The picture looks more red to me, but it&#x27;s almost a true brown. I like it for a professional look and think has just the right amount of shine, no glitter.</li>
    <li> This is a great color for the office.  Neutral enough to go with anything without being a typical neutral like a nude or tan.  It&#x27;s a more &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; color for sure but not boring.</li>
    <li> Great color.  More pink/purple raisin colored.  Not mauve.  Beautiful though.</li>
    <li> This is a nice mauvy rosy color. I think it would look great with any skin tone. It will definitely end up being one of my go to colors.</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite color. It&#x27;s an odd, flat, mauve. My rating is based solely on the color- the Gelish brand of nailpolish is excellent. I didn&#x27;t have problems with how the color went on- I only needed 2 coats. It&#x27;s winter now, so maybe that&#x27;s part of why I don&#x27;t love the color. I feel like this would be better in the spring. It&#x27;s professional, though, and works for the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- I went back and tried this again in the Springtime. Still, not a great color for my skin tone. Oh well!</li>
    <li> I really like this color.  It is a brownish, medium pink.  It is very flattering on and I have gotten more compliments on this Gelish color than the others I have tried before.  This is probably the 7th or 8th Gelish I have tried.  I will use this color frequently as it is very versatile.</li>
    <li> This polish did not cover well at all. it looked like a translucent or it separated and/or was old. We have used 2 others and there were no issues</li>
    <li> The color is more of a peach rather than a mauve as it looks on the picture here.  The polish iteself is fine but the color is mis-leading.  It&#x27;s a peachy/tan color.  Not very bright, a little dull and light.  I asked someone what color they thought it was and they said it&#x27;s a mauve but it&#x27;s light mauve.  To me it looks peachy/tanish/mauve!  Hope this helps!  It&#x27;s not a bad color, just doesn&#x27;t look like the picture on line to me.</li>
    <li> Creamy mauve, exactly what I was looking for: Samuri without the glitter. Arrived fast and love the product. Lasted two weeks on me.</li>
    <li> Half the price of  Shellac......need I say more.  I love the product! Great coverage and lasting shine.  Need to use bond-aid with it!</li>
    <li> Color was true to the color shown. Is simply a dusty rose or mauve. Is nice for everyday. Not too bright.</li>
    <li> Mauvey, Rosy, a little Brownish. Think dusty rose, but browner and more vintage-looking. Complements skin with yellow or green undertones. Love it.</li>
    <li> I like my nails to look classic and pretty but not plain.  Exhale is perfect for that.  It&#x27;s a little more dusty rose than in the picture. Not really a pastel. It&#x27;s a nice creamy color that looks good on my pale skin.  This is just a lovely classic. I like color (I think French Manicures are totally boring and common) and this is a choice that will look good on any occasion.</li>
    <li> Great color and brand.</li>
    <li> I bought all the equipment to do my own gel nails.  Total joke.  Let the professionals do it. The color is great but the entire process of doing your own&lt;br /&gt;nails is very tricky.</li>
    <li> Exhale is a difficult color to describe.  I would say \\&quot;dusty rose\\&quot;, a \\&quot;very dusky apricot\\&quot;, the dark sunburned spot on a peach.  But I discovered that I had an almost dupe - &#x27;Undercover&#x27; by Wet and Wild in their Megalast line. Exhale is just a TAD bit lighter ---- in some light.  If you want to check out the color....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week I usually get bored with a color and start playing around - stamping, nail art, french tips, etc. (The wonderful part of gel polish is you can put regular polish on top and remove it with non-acetone remover for a special occasion or fun!)  I&#x27;ve had this on 10 days and have not yet changed a thing.</li>
    <li> This was the first color I used after getting my UV lamp. It went on very easily and evenly and looked like a professional manicure. It has a hint of brown in it, so it isn&#x27;t a real pinky pink. It looks good with any color I wear - very versatile. It stayed on for a good 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t chip at all. It was only due to the growth of my nails that I had to redo them. I would definitely recommend this color and the Gelish products.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely color.  I believe it&#x27;s just a bit lighter after it&#x27;s applied, but it&#x27;s still very pretty and covers well.</li>
    <li> This color is a pale grape color. Very pretty, and nicely represented by the photo provided by another customer. Covered well with 2 coats.</li>
    <li> I ordered a bunch to try but this one is my favorite! It&#x27;s got enough pink to go with pinks and red while not clashing with my corals. I&#x27;ll use this one a lot!</li>
    <li> Good color for everyday.  It is neutral enough not to be too showy but makes your hands look good.  I&#x27;ll definitely be using it often.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. I used a foundation gel and a topcoat gel as well, and it lasted two weeks. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s what my husband said and he&#x27;s right.  It covered my Bella&#x27;s Vampire (black) color with 3 coats.  It&#x27;s one of the prettiest colors I&#x27;ve seen in Gelish.</li>
    <li> Love the color and the shipping was quick!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color..gives your nails a perfect mauve color that can be worn with any color</li>
    <li> Lovely color that goes on well.  Not a gaudy color.  Nice for work and nice dates.  Not a lot of glitter look to it.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how to explain the color maybe mauve or a brownish not purple or red..This color is one of my favorites one coat and it looks awesome... It goes with any color you wear. Very impressed</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this color; dull and drab. High quality polish like all of Gelish&#x27;s, but the color was a let down.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a really natural color, then this color is great!  It&#x27;s a really neutral pink shade and it goes well with any skin tone.  My mom is very fair and it looks really nice on her--I&#x27;m a little darker and I like how it looks on me too.  Again, like with any gelish polish make sure that you apply a thin coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shipping.  I buy on Monday and know that by Thursday or Friday I&#x27;ll have my polish.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is the color  I expected.  A nice neutral darkish mauve.  It&#x27;s a creme color-no; shimmer to it at all.&lt;br /&gt;It would be prettier and more noticeable if it had shimmer.</li>
