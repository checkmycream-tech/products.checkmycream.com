      <li>I was really happy to see that it,it was still&lt;br /&gt;being  </li>
      <li>They discontinued the silver expressions line a year or so ago, and I am so happy that they are making it again.  </li>
      <li>Love these products!!  </li>
      <li>This is a good shampoo and brand for that.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
      <li>I surely do!</li>
      <li>I was so glad that I found Pantene Silver Expressions!  </li>
      <li>That part is nice, because some of these products turn the gray sort of steel colored.</li>
      <li>/&gt;shampoo seems nice.</li>
      <li>I would strongly recommend this product to anyone that love their gray hair and want to show it off in grand style!  </li>
      <li>Was so glad to see that Psntene had a product for gray hair as I&#x27;d never seen one in the stores.</li>
      <li>I love this combination.  </li>
      <li>It is more like a clarifying shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It brings great shine to salt and pepper hair and makes the gray appear very silvery.</li>
      <li>Wonderfull i love this model</li>
      <li>Will try to find out if safe to use without staining anything.</li>
      <li>maybe I should shake it more before use.  </li>
      <li>This is more silver.</li>
      <li>So glad to find this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>GOOD SHAMPOO - COLORING MAKES MY GREY HAIR LOOK GOOD.  </li>
      <li>Husband liked this very much.</li>
      <li>My hair is frizzy and fine and dries easily.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t think I used alot of the conditioner.</li>
      <li>The conditioner works great with that grey hair that has a mind of its own, the shampoo is good but just doesn&#x27;t get all the brassisness out , does pretty good but found the Crew Classic Grey does a better job.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Prior to the use of this shampoo my hair was in good condition.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner go hand in hand to get the true effect you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
      <li>Glad I can still get this somewhere - my mom really likes this.</li>
      <li>This one is better than most, especially since my hair has no &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; tinge after once weekly use.</li>
      <li>I love how it keeps my hair soft and keeps the silver color true.  </li>
      <li>Yet... It is kind of purple and wonder if it will stain my white spoteless shower.</li>
      <li>I have grey hair and it often needs a bit of a boost to make sure the grey is bright and not yellowing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and easy to style.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine pewter and soft.</li>
      <li>I think this will help prevent any yellowish buildup over time, but it is not something safe for me to use daily.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find these products in local stores....</li>
      <li>Now only if it moisturized more.</li>
      <li>After two days of use I could tell that it effectively cleaned other products from my hair, however, in the end</li>
      <li>My hair feels so clean and soft, but the curls did not come out.  </li>
      <li>I love panteen silver but not when the bottle was open on the plastic and almost 1/2 was spilled , the inside of the plastic they were in was purple and very slimy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, so I&#x27;m happy I can buy it on Amazon, even though the price is way too high.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>maybe I used too much?  </li>
      <li>It really makes no difference whether it&#x27;s for gray or not.</li>
      <li>Really like this combo.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for some time I really like it</li>
      <li>Keeps my salt and pepper hair soft, shiny, and yellow free.</li>
      <li>It also leaves hair feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>I resorted to only using the shampoo once a week and using my other more moisturizing products the rest of the time.  </li>
      <li>Not sold in any stores near me</li>
      <li>When I had silver/white hair it kept my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Brightens silver, white or gray hair, leaves hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>My hair is normal to dry.  </li>
      <li>Using it now to help fade the hair dye back to my natural white.</li>

    <li> My hair dresser suggested I use a shampoo for my graying hair.  I was so glad that I found Pantene Silver Expressions!  It is expensive but worth every penny.  The shampoo and conditioner go hand in hand to get the true effect you&#x27;re looking for.  I would strongly recommend this product to anyone that love their gray hair and want to show it off in grand style!  I surely do!</li>

    <li> GOOD SHAMPOO - COLORING MAKES MY GREY HAIR LOOK GOOD.  ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different products over the years. This one is better than most, especially since my hair has no &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; tinge after once weekly use.</li>
    <li> I have grey hair and it often needs a bit of a boost to make sure the grey is bright and not yellowing.  This is a good shampoo and brand for that.</li>

    <li> Always used this product  but could not find it anywhere.Thought I would try to find it  on-line.I was really happy to see that it,it was still&lt;br /&gt;being  made.I have silver hair and it is hard to find a product that really helps.I have used this product for a lot of years.</li>
    <li> product as described, works well</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for some time I really like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with it.  It really makes no difference whether it&#x27;s for gray or not.</li>
    <li> very good product, I will re-order.</li>
    <li> Makes gray hair sparkle and look silver. A very good product.</li>
    <li> So glad to find this shampoo. Just can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore. When I had silver/white hair it kept my hair soft and shiny. Using it now to help fade the hair dye back to my natural white. I highly recommend to anyone who has dull gray or yellowed white hair.</li>

    <li> Glad I can still get this somewhere - my mom really likes this. Bummer that its so much more expensive than regular pantene flavors though.</li>
    <li> Really like this combo. Was so glad to see that Psntene had a product for gray hair as I&#x27;d never seen one in the stores. So I&#x27;ll be buying these from Amazon in the future!</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair very dry and brittle.  My hair is normal to dry.  Prior to the use of this shampoo my hair was in good condition.  I would not purchase this product again.  I am not happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Wonderfull i love this model</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair dryer than regular shampoos and conditioners, but it does brighten the gray. That part is nice, because some of these products turn the gray sort of steel colored. This is more silver. Now only if it moisturized more. Sigh.... maybe I&#x27;ll mix Fekai Glossing conditioner together with this.</li>
    <li> I used this the day after I got it.  My hair feels so clean and soft, but the curls did not come out.  (I have a perm.)  My hair is white.  This product will keep it white and from turning that yellow tone that some of us get as we age.  I am so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> conditioner seemed to leave my hair kinda stiff.  maybe I used too much?  I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t think I used alot of the conditioner. noticed the conditioner had a thick-type substance when poured from the bottle.  maybe I should shake it more before use.  don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shampoo seems nice.</li>
    <li> Keeps my salt and pepper hair soft, shiny, and yellow free.</li>
