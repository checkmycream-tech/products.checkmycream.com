      <li>My absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>The cooling sensation from the menthol is nice, but as far as the exfoliating power I would expect from a &#x27;scrub&#x27;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This a great gentle daily scrub for the morning. It leaves a minty feel on your skin after using, very invigorating. I have noted how my skin is looking more smooth after constantly using it.</li>
    <li> I have used literrally every time of face wash and this one is the best. I use this for my back and face one a night when i shower. I use a clearisil daily wash sensitive for morning and.mid day because my face gets oily. This wash makes me feel clean and gives a nice clean cool feeling own your skin once applied. I highly recommend this product at any price.</li>
    <li> I have burns on my face from a bad reaction from Differen. This is the only source of relief I have been able to find. Lotions burn so bad! This stuff is amazing! It&#x27;s cool on your face and isn&#x27;t scratchy like a lot of cleansers I have tried before.</li>
    <li> When I got this order, I was surprised because it had very poor packaging. It was opened with a little spilled out. There was foam inside the bag that it came out of and I had to wash it. Besides that, the product was very good.</li>
    <li> Great product from a really good company.</li>
    <li> Gives a clean and a cool feeling right after use. The little scrub things help clean out the dirt from pours. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this! It feels like an ocean breeze on my face! You can actually FEEL it working, and my skin looks much cleaner! A great buy, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Nice balance in bead courseness.  Pleasant smell.  Best exfoliant I have ever used.  Also competitiely priced with similar products.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> today I received the Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub and it came almost half empty. This was the only problem because it smells good. If the bottle was full I would absolutely give it 5 out 5</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic AND cheap. Can you beat that? This face wash is different than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s tingly and refreshing, the microbeads are great and it truly deep cleans my skin without drying it out or making it feel tight. This kind of find makes me just a little happier inside. :)</li>
    <li> Love the mint feel after washing your face, and the micro beads clean away the facial oil. I am happy to use this product!</li>
    <li> I have used this wash for 3-4 years and love it. Amazon usually has the lowest price on it (when they have it in stock).    Great product.</li>
    <li> first i was hesitating to order such liquid products from amazon since im in my lonely planet and worried for the item to be destroy while ship to norway..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;finally it arrived and it absolutely  safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- when my first use of this product i felt more cooling lightweight sensation of my face unlike another face scruber i&#x27;v used...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks to amazon and neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my husband also loves to use it ;);)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ill order more next time ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hurray fra norge ;);)</li>
    <li> This product will work for both teenagers and adults.  I purchased this for my daughter, and she and I both absolutely love it.  Has a nice odor, and very refreshing.  It leaves a clean feel when done washing your face.  I told her I had to try it out so that I could write a review and know how well it would work.  She was concerned that I would use it all up.  Now I have to figure the best moisturizer that pairs well with this.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I would like a cleaner so much.  But it is actually fun to put it on as soon as I get home in the evening and just imagine all the dirt, grease and grime of my day being dissolved and removed.  I love the tingly feeling, too, after I&#x27;ve rinsed with water!  Recommended to all and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for ~3 months and can DEFINITELY see a difference. I used to have moderate/severe acne, now it&#x27;s almost gone! It&#x27;s still there, but compared to before, it&#x27;s not too noticeable, I don&#x27;t even put that much foundation any more. I am sooo happy with this product, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin much or anything, but it can sting a little sometimes. But in general, I am very satisfied, I will keep buying this product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 10+ years and still use it regularly. Now my teenage son loves it too. Does a good job of controlling acne and feels fresh and yes invigorating. I did notice that the price is increasing though.</li>
    <li> when i started using theproduct it looked amazing however after couple weeks it made my acne worse and did not help at all</li>
    <li> Go to the store and buy this. It got Squished in the flat box that they put it in. The squeeze made it open and spill out all over. What a waste of money and product.</li>
    <li> works alright wish it would sting more so i know it is working</li>
    <li> I use this every 3 days and it works great.  I can&#x27;t tell if there&#x27;s an improvement or not over other brands or plain soap because I&#x27;ve never gone without it for a few years (different brand though).  I guess that I can say this product works for its intended use, but only time will tell if this will keep my face clean or not, aka removing dead skin cells.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t foam up at all! no joke, I felt my skin no cleaner than before. I used the whole thing and nothing. Didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but sure didn&#x27;t do a good job foaming up</li>
    <li> Neutrogena uses tiny spherical particles of polyethylene in their scrubs as an abrasive. Billions of tiny plastic beads are polluting lakes, rivers and oceans and harming fish and other wildlife. Until Neutrogena cleans up their act, I won&#x27;t purchase more of their products and I will only buy from companies that use sugar or salt instead.</li>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy this product. It&#x27;s wonderful for in the morning because it really wakes me up and leaved my face feeling fresh and squeaky clean without drying out my skin too terribly. Love it!</li>
    <li> For some reason my first review didn&#x27;t post, but I&#x27;m taking the time to write another, that&#x27;s how much I like this product! It works awesomely, my skin is clearer, pores smaller, it removes all of my makeup, doesnt dry my skin out, and has a fun tingly effect, which probably isnt beneficial, but it feels nice. I highly recommend this product! :)</li>
    <li> this is actually a very good face wash! i will rate 10 out of 10.going to buy more if i finish this. you cant use scrub everyday, so it will last long.i feel refresh everytime i use. i like the scent too</li>
    <li> The cooling sensation from the menthol is nice, but as far as the exfoliating power I would expect from a &#x27;scrub&#x27; it&#x27;s quite lacking. Just a few puny plastic beads floatin&#x27; around in there, they don&#x27;t do much. Instead I recommend [[ASIN:B000UVWGGA St. Ives Fresh Skin Invigorating Apricot Scrub, 10 Ounce]], now that&#x27;s a true scrub!</li>
    <li> When microbeads strike our faces and drag along our pores we get the feeling that something positive is happening--like an eviction notice for blackheads and whiteheads.  But that&#x27;s all that it really does is give us a positive feeling.  What I found after using this product is that it completely strips all oil from my face leaving it dry and all these microbeads congregate in my drain and are harder to get rid of than that guy you used to know who slept on the floor of your freshman dorm.</li>
    <li> leaves a nice fresh clean feeling, use this before bed.</li>
    <li> I use it during morning shower and has a mint sensation that feels great!  I&#x27;ve tried other Neutrogena cleansers and like this one better.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well and does what it is supposed to do. It&#x27;s not completely amazing, but it is worth it for how much it costs.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I will definitely order this again! feel so fresh when I wash my face! very good!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product on 2 to 4 times a week as part of my makeup routine for the last 6 months.  It has a minty/eucalyptus smell that gives your skin a cooling feel.  My skin is very sensitive to fragrances and does not get rashy at all after use.  It does an excellent job exfoliating my skin and as a preventative measure against breakouts.  I have not found this product to be drying however I use it prior to my clinique moisturizer.  I have used many scrubs and prefer this one.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and cool stopped my breakouts it works amazingly I recommend to anyone with oily face and having breakouts this really helps</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and works great to clear out those pores. I love this stuff it really invigorates me with the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Excellent face soap that tingles when you first apply it.  It does a good job of scrubbing your face and making it feel quite clean and oil free.  A lot comes out of the bottle so beware when using it.  And it smells pretty decent.  A clean smell definitely more of a man smell but I don&#x27;t think a woman would be totally turned away from it depending on their specific scent tastes.</li>
    <li> Loved the fresh clean feeling. You really feel it going to work.  My face feels instantly smoother. I will keep buying this product</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed a new cleanser. This truly does wake me up a bit. The beads create a cooling, tingling sensation, and my face feels pretty clean after use. If my face is already suffering (dry, etc.), the tingling sensation does feel to be a bit too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, acne-conscious people should be aware that, although this product eliminates oil and dirt, there are no acne-fighting ingredients.</li>
    <li> I really like how this opens my pores in the morning. It smells great and works to prevent and take care of any breakouts. While cleaning and exfoliating my skin. The tingling feeling really helps to wake me up. :D</li>
    <li> This product works great! After using it, my face feels nice and clean. Though it is in no way an acne medicine, the fact that it thoroughly cleans your face down to the pores, it definitely helps a bunch!</li>
    <li> The beads wash away impurities and dead skin leaves your face feeling like if u put menthol on it face and are in front of a fan. Wow what a breeze. Love it.</li>
    <li> All the other scrubs that I&#x27;ve tried leave my face irritated and dry. This on the other hand leaves it feeling fresh and rejuvenated!</li>
    <li> Love this face wash I have been using it for the last few years I love the refreshing feeling when I wash my face.</li>
    <li> Really gets at them pores and dead skin on the face.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your face feeling fresh and invigorated.&lt;br /&gt;Good product. Good face scrub.</li>
    <li> I love all of Neutragena&#x27;s line. Only thing I didnt like was the facial moisturizer with the sunscreen, but only because I&#x27;m allergic to SPF.Cleans well, not too drying. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I used this cleanser for the first time last night, and it was wonderful!  I loved the &amp;#34;invigorating&amp;#34; tingling sensation.. makes it feel like it&#x27;s actually doing something.  I used this in conjunction with a Neutrogena moisturizer, and my face is very soft and smooth right now- like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
    <li> Makes you feel clean and has a tingly pore opening feeling first thing in the morning. It&#x27;s nice. I like that feeling. When used consistently prevents acne.</li>
    <li> you don&#x27;t really feel much invigoration when washing, but after rinse, you feel it.  you face feels like it&#x27;s lit up like a sign with energy.  feels very clean.</li>
    <li> Using this with Oxy Maximum Daily Face Wash as recommended by another user. Using this first, then Oxy wash. Husband likes.</li>
    <li> I like it so far so good. I think the side is to small, but is ok I like it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has me using this product and it works well. The little scrub particles really help exfoliate the skin&lt;br /&gt;without losing it&#x27;s moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at that review, I should work for a beauty magazine or something.</li>
    <li> I like the sensation it give when I use it. My face looks very clen after I wash it with this product.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this face wash I noticed it seemed to be making my skin worse. So I stopped for a while and went back to using a basic bar of soap and/or body wash. I&#x27;ve tried two other times now, using this face wash once a day for a few days in a row and like clock work I start breaking out. My skin is pretty average, not oily or dry, fair and freckly, and this face wash does not work for me.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I like this product because we like the scent.  It is sort of \\&quot;invigorating.\\&quot;  I was already using this product, but bought it from my local retailer, so was pleased to find it was offered on Amazon for a lower price.  I personally would like to see Amazon start carrying more products like this as I prefer online shopping over shopping at big box stores.  My only gripe is that this cleanser is called a \\&quot;foaming\\&quot; cleanser.  I personally think of a something that foams when you dispense it and this is not the case.  Since I had already been using the product, I knew this ahead of time, but for someone who is a first-time buyer, it lathers (foams is a bit overstated) in your hands.  I also like this product because it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  I find that my face is super-sensitive to products with a lot of acne meds in it and they can really irritate my skin.  This product does not do that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on all the good reviews.  It arrived promptly and the packaging was fine.  While I did like the way it cleaned, I did not like the smell.  Some reviews said it smelled \\&quot;minty\\&quot; and like \\&quot;eucalyptus.\\&quot;  I didn&#x27;t get that at all.  All I smelled was a strong, perfume like smell that wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I started to get a headache from it.  If you are sensitive to strong fragrances, I would stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past, it feels good after you use it and it really works for my skin type.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors year round, whether it be for work or hiking/biking.  I dig this scrub because no matter how filthy I am throughout the day, it leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh afterwards.  It also opens your sinuses with the menthol feeling it provides giving an even more invigorating experience.  I squeeze some into a small bottle for hiking trips, so all I have to do is add some drinking water to it in the morning and shake it up!  No need to repeat what all the other reviews are stating.. just get some of this and try it out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that prevents a 5 star rating is the price.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive, especially being that it comes in a 4.2oz bottle.  They need to have larger bottles for people like myself that use it frequently.. that way i&#x27;m not constantly waiting for a tube to come in.</li>
    <li> Excelent quality x price ratio. I have already used the product and it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this face scrub it has a little tingling feeling when you wash your face and the smell is clean smelling but there really isn&#x27;t enough product I wish they made the bottle bigger</li>
    <li> product came busted open and it got everywhere. The product is great but the way its packaged is not great and i had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> It is clean, refreshing, without leaving the skin dry. I&#x27;ve noticed a vast improvement in my skin as well. It does not over dry, leaves no soapy residue or felling post-wash, and really makes the skin feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: a little amount goes a long way!</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t an easy way to determine if a scrub works except over time. Having used this product for over a month, it definitely has helped clear up my skin. The &#x27;tingly&#x27; feeling is as advertised - very refreshing. Highly recommend this along with an acne treatment product daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also get free shipping and a 5% discount if you do a subscription through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably 20 different facial scrubs.  This one is not too rough but there are some actual scrubbing beads.  Its also an excellent wake up scrub, very invigorating.</li>
    <li> This line from neutrogena is great.  It feels refreshing.  It really cleans your skin.  And, is not too harsh for winter.</li>
    <li> Nice clean feeling, would order again. Didn&#x27;t feel like it was drying to my face, just clean. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this face wash more than the other brands. I think it works well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin too dry. This has a cool feeling when applied and the micro beads helps with scrubbing. This 4.2oz tube last me about 2 months because I only use it once a day at night. In the morning I use something else to clean my face, less powerful more conditioning since my face doesn&#x27;t accumulate as much dirt when sleeping.</li>
    <li> Great Great Great product, my skin felt the tightness and tingle during and after use.</li>
    <li> Though it is recommended to use this product daily, I feel that it dries my skin when I do so.I use it every two-five days and it does its job! it does not prevent acne from ever happening but it does a great task of keeping them from over taking my face.</li>
    <li> Nothing special, but the cool sensation and clean feeling was nice. This didn&#x27;t always help with acne, but it did more good than harm for me.</li>
    <li> it kinda reminds me of icy hot but on your face if that makes sense as far as how well it works i havent been using it long enough to see a difference the only negative thing i have to say about this is that when it arrived the bottle was half empty as if it opened in the packaging it also had some of the product on the lid and the outer part of the packaging :(</li>
    <li> I use this every day, twice a day and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. And it feels so refreshing. My absolute favorite.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena stuff, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any of their products. I was looking for an exfoliating face scrub and I bought this one. I only use it every other day to not irritate my face, but not long after I started using it, I started breaking out much more than usual. Nothing in my diet had changed, or in the weather, so I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing pimples on my cheeks. Using this was the only thing that was different. I don&#x27;t want to say this scrub was causing the breakouts, but until I find whatever else could be the cause, I can&#x27;t help but think this was it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews, and don&#x27;t usually find face creams effective but this one makes your face feel so clear and invigorating I had to post a review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee you&#x27;ll come back and write a comment like mine after you buy it! my face is so much healthier and cleaner after 2 days</li>
    <li> NEUTROGENA IS GREAT AT PRODUCING&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY SKIN CARE PRODUCTS  -&lt;br /&gt;THIS ITEM IS ONE OF THEIR BEST -&lt;br /&gt;MADE MY SKIN FEEL SMOOTH AND SOFT AFTER USE</li>
    <li> This shipped really fast, and very pleased with the results. I can&#x27;t find this product in my local store at this price so that&#x27;s why I came here. I am very pleased with the product itself. My first time using this and I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t really had a breakout within a week. I use this at night before I go to bed along with an astringent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foaming scrub for several weeks, and so far, it cleaned without drying my sun-tanned face to peel. Just love how it leaves my face feeling cool &amp; refresh and tingly sensation, after using it!  (Believe it or not) When I received this product, the  plastic tube was half-empty; 2.1 FL OZ of gel must be evaporated out of thin air over the years. The price is not affordable, compare to other brands - Axe, Clean &amp; Clear, Dove Men + Care, Nivea, or St. Ives. Other users have complained about making his/her skin worse, and/or causing face issues, such as acne/pimples, but I have not had any negative reactions. Made in U.S.A.</li>
