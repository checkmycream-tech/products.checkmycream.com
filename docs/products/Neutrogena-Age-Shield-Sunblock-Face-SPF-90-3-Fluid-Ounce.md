      <li>I am very selective about what I put on my face, as I make my own lotions and soaps.  </li>
      <li>This sunblock, Age Shield SPF 90+ is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>The benzone chemicals produce a tremendous amount of free radicals once exposed to UV light.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to find this product since I need something for when we are at outdoor shows, and working in the yard.  </li>
      <li>I WENT TO WALL-MART AND TRIED MANY SUNBLOCKS TO SEE IF THEY LEFT THE WHITE RESIDUE AND THIS PRODUCT ABSORBED PERFECTLY INTO MY SKIN WITHOUT THE WIERD DISCOLORATION.</li>
      <li>Everything they said is true.  </li>
      <li>has a really strong odor, but you get over it pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>We all sound like broken records, but it&#x27;s all true, this sunblock is the BEST!  </li>
      <li>Living in Southern California, I&#x27;ve tried many different sunblocks, this one is the best by far.</li>
      <li>I will Definitely order more when I run out!  </li>
      <li>No residue, and it blends right into your skin.  </li>
      <li>It made my pores look smaller and my skin more refined.</li>
      <li>Also, these super high spf sunscreens are just gimmicks.  </li>
      <li>i read the one other review here and gave it a shot - same results - great under makeup - dries fast and not greasy and no residue...</li>
      <li>I believe this is one of the finest face creams with a very high sunblock SPF feature on the market.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon reviewers.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves their skin and doesn&#x27;t want it damaged by the sun!</li>
      <li>I am really dissapointed.</li>
      <li>but if it does I will be ready.  </li>
      <li>if it really works seeing as the sun never shines here...</li>
      <li>I put it on every morning before I go out and take a long walk with my baby, and I come back sunburn-free which is very important.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply and I use it daily as a lotion in the morning and reapply during the day, especially when I am outside.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old moisturizer was making my makeup look until i tried this...  LOVE it!!!!      </li>
      <li>Saying that, I do like to add a little of my normal face lotion just to smooth it on without tugging my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have tried literally everything, from high end to sensitive to natural skin products.</li>
      <li>This works fine if you go out a lot because of work, exercise, or leisure; using it plain &amp; applying again as needed.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t break me out, absorbs super-fast, and is completely non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>the spf 85 neutrogena stuff - in a white and light blue tube is TOTALLY different from this - it leaves a white residue you have to scrap off before applying makeup - ick.</li>
      <li>I have been unable to purchase it at any drug or department store in my area and was delighted to see Amazon.com carried this and at a price lower than at the drugstore where my prior purchase had been made.  </li>
      <li>But I highly recommend their other product</li>
      <li>I have spent so much money on make-up primers that did not live up to their promises.</li>

<li> Cons:  1.Medicinal odor, stays for a few mins though</li>
<li> I use on my face and forehead and have no problem with it running down and getting into my eyes!!  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I can definitely feel it on my face -</li>
<li> :( They send me a big box with a lot of space</li>
<li> Was tired of using products that ran and burned my eyes.  </li>
<li> it feels greasy, and also has a per-fumy scent that I don&#x27;t like, and unfortunately will have to wash this off as the smell is bothering me.</li>
<li> I randomly borrowed this from my mother in law when I was in Hawaii and was shocked that I didnt have a reaction to it.</li>
<li> I usually hate sunblocks because they smell, are greasy, and feel yucky on my skin.</li>
<li> if you will be putting on make up as it will stay on longer than if you use this Age Shield as a base.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I read the comments of other Amazon customers. It&#x27;s important to know what experience others have had with products and affilates.   I went online to Neutrogenas website and an online consultant suggested I try Age Sheild SPF 90. I usually hate sunblocks because they smell, are greasy, and feel yucky on my skin. But I read the other reviews on Amazon and thought I&#x27;ll try this last one and then I give up.   Everything they said is true.  It goes on easily and lightly-no chemical smell-and enhances my skin tone. I don&#x27;t wear make up and when I saw my face in the mirror after it soaked in-there is a noticeable different in texture.  Now if I can find a night cream that measures up to this I&#x27;ll be set.  Thanks Amazon reviewers.</li>
    <li> As a sun conscience woman, I have tried a lot of different sunblocks with lotion.  This one is amazing! It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky and smelly.  It is very easy to apply and I use it daily as a lotion in the morning and reapply during the day, especially when I am outside.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves their skin and doesn&#x27;t want it damaged by the sun!</li>
    <li> I bought this item a few days ago and the containing box was empty. Do not buy this item from this Company, they never give it to me an answer about this problem</li>
    <li> This sunblock, Age Shield SPF 90+ is fantastic.  I have darker skin, so I can&#x27;t wear the sunblock that leaves the white streaks.  Neutrogena&#x27;s SPF 70 leaves that, unlike this one.  I wondered why and found out that the SPF 90 has different active sunblock ingredients than the one that leaves the streaks.  This sunblock provides outstanding protection from the sun too. I&#x27;ve put it on my face and chest and not my back, and realized tan lines on my back... ONLY where I&#x27;d put no sunblock!  It&#x27;s awesome for everyday use.  I actually use it as a \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t break me out, absorbs super-fast, and is completely non-greasy.  And I use a powder makeup over it and it blends flawlessly without cakey areas.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, but I&#x27;ll stop here for risk of sounding like an advertisement.  Hopefully they never stop making this stuff...</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my mom and works really good in her. It&#x27;s durable and truly protects SPF 90</li>
    <li> has a really strong odor, but you get over it pretty quickly.  this stuff works great and absorbs quickly.  I will Definitely order more when I run out!  ******   I&#x27;m editing my review... After much research on sunscreens the chemicals in this product can do more damage than good.  The benzone chemicals produce a tremendous amount of free radicals once exposed to UV light.  Free radicals cause a lot of damage and skin aging!  Also, these super high spf sunscreens are just gimmicks.  They don&#x27;t give you much more protection over an spf 40 and exposes you to much more chemicals.  I would recommend a physical sunblock.  Something with Zinc oxide and Titanium Dioxide.</li>
    <li> i read the one other review here and gave it a shot - same results - great under makeup - dries fast and not greasy and no residue...didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old moisturizer was making my makeup look until i tried this...  LOVE it!!!!      btw the spf 85 neutrogena stuff - in a white and light blue tube is TOTALLY different from this - it leaves a white residue you have to scrap off before applying makeup - ick.</li>
    <li> I am very selective about what I put on my face, as I make my own lotions and soaps.  I was excited to find this product since I need something for when we are at outdoor shows, and working in the yard.  It showed today, and I immediately put it on.  While I haven&#x27;t used it outdoors, the feel of it on my face is what makes or breaks a product.  Unfortunately, I can definitely feel it on my face - it feels greasy, and also has a per-fumy scent that I don&#x27;t like, and unfortunately will have to wash this off as the smell is bothering me.</li>
    <li> Una muy buena crema bloqueadora. No es grasosa como otras y no deja la cara brillante. Simplemente excelente y a un precio accesible.</li>
    <li> We all sound like broken records, but it&#x27;s all true, this sunblock is the BEST!  No residue, and it blends right into your skin.  I put it on every morning before I go out and take a long walk with my baby, and I come back sunburn-free which is very important. I don&#x27;t want leathery skin, gross.  Living in Southern California, I&#x27;ve tried many different sunblocks, this one is the best by far.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a strong sunscreen that did not contain a lot of carcinogenic chemicals.  I read the description on the website carefully and there was no mention of oxybenzone and avobenzone and octocrylene and octisalate.  Well, that is what this cream is made out of .  And it cannot be returned.  So what a rip off.</li>
    <li> This works fine if you go out a lot because of work, exercise, or leisure; using it plain &amp; applying again as needed. But I highly recommend their other product Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Sheer Liquid SPF70 if you will be putting on make up as it will stay on longer than if you use this Age Shield as a base.</li>
    <li> I believe this is one of the finest face creams with a very high sunblock SPF feature on the market.  I have been unable to purchase it at any drug or department store in my area and was delighted to see Amazon.com carried this and at a price lower than at the drugstore where my prior purchase had been made.  It leaves a smooth feeling to my face, not gummy, and lasts for most of the day.</li>
    <li> I bought the 2 pack option and I only received 1!!!! I am really dissapointed.:( They send me a big box with a lot of space but there only came 1 product.</li>
    <li> When I sweat this somehow gets in my eyes. I was under the impression after reading reviews that this would not happen, but it does help with sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I tried Neutrogena Age Shield Face Sunblock SPF 90 and was amazed. The product dries to a matte finish and proved to be a great base for make-up. It made my pores look smaller and my skin more refined. Make-up stayed all day and no sunburn. People have been telling me that I have perfect skin! i don&#x27;t. I have spent so much money on make-up primers that did not live up to their promises. It was by accident that I discovered the dual use for this sunblock. I will use it forever.</li>
    <li> I just started using this and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I have no idea if it really works seeing as the sun never shines here... but if it does I will be ready.  Saying that, I do like to add a little of my normal face lotion just to smooth it on without tugging my skin.  Great stuff and will continue to use and wait for the sun.</li>
    <li> I am a surfer and use this product everytime I go out.  Was tired of using products that ran and burned my eyes.  Was turned on to this product by another surfer.  I use on my face and forehead and have no problem with it running down and getting into my eyes!!  This is second year of using this product!!   Also leaves to skin in great condition after hours of brutal sun exposure!!!</li>
    <li> It is a good product. I bought it for my wife. And she is happy with her cream.  Good product.</li>
    <li> should have got the 50 SPF, same results less money. compare for yourself and you be the judge for this is so one sided....</li>
    <li> I JUST DID A LACTIC ACID PEEL SO PROTECTING MY FACE WAS VERY CRITICAL. I HAVE DARK SKIN AND  THE SUNBLOCK RESIDUE  CAUSES ME TO LOOK \\&quot;PURPLE\\&quot; (IT&#x27;S EXTREMELY EMBARRASSING BECAUSE MY COWORKERS ALWAYS POINT IT OUT TO ME!)  I WENT TO WALL-MART AND TRIED MANY SUNBLOCKS TO SEE IF THEY LEFT THE WHITE RESIDUE AND THIS PRODUCT ABSORBED PERFECTLY INTO MY SKIN WITHOUT THE WIERD DISCOLORATION. IM IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEEP IN MIND IM VERY CRITICAL OF EVERYTHING AND THIS PRODUCT HAS NO FLAWS.</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m in my skin lightening face, I use this on my face and neck before I got outside. I&#x27;m fair skinned and tan easily. This helps to block sun rays that tan the skin. Smells wonderful and is very effective.</li>
    <li> Pros:  1. Good product, good suncreen  2. Non oily works well even on an oily skin like mine  4. Dint have any break out after applying this product, usually I do with other suncreens  5. Easily wear make up on top of this    Cons:  1.Medicinal odor, stays for a few mins though</li>
    <li> I have tried literally everything, from high end to sensitive to natural skin products. I randomly borrowed this from my mother in law when I was in Hawaii and was shocked that I didnt have a reaction to it. Practically everything has made me break out, except for this. I know this is an SPF but I use it as my daily moisturizer as well. It keeps my skin protected and smooth. Now I just need to find a moisturizer like this that I can use at night.</li>
