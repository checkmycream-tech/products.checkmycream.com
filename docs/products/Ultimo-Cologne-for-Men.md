      <li>Love the fragrance on my husband!</li>
      <li>SO I ORDERED MY OWN BOTTLE AND DARED HIM TO TOUCH IT.....</li>
      <li>so this is perfect light light scent</li>
      <li>It smells nice, is not over powering, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my husband&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it (&amp; my husband loves its affect on me)!</li>
      <li>Very light smell..</li>
      <li>But guys like women that smell of great perfume, and women are attracted to men that smell certain ways.</li>
      <li>Well, this year I splurged and am glad I did.</li>
      <li>If you want your man to smell handsome, this works.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
      <li>I love this cologne.  </li>
      <li>Women love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Had many compliments.  </li>
      <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t wear many colognes.</li>
      <li>Ultimo Cologne in my opinion is the top cologne for men.  </li>
      <li>its ok..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, a simple spray will do you for a day, and it&#x27;s a great clean scent.</li>
      <li>Best stuff ever had; hands down!  </li>
      <li>but I was too cheap to spend $50 for a bottle of cologne.</li>
      <li>Great scent last all day</li>
      <li>I am extremely happy and excited knowing I can replenish or purchase through Amazon when I need to in the future.</li>
      <li>It smells very clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Everyone (women in particular) would ask me what kind of Cologne I was wearing and where could they purchase it for their husband or boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>And so why do I need seventeen more words to say the exact same&lt;br /&gt;thing again?</li>
      <li>You see I want to be the only one smelling so good.        </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but I&#x27;m not that into powder scents.</li>
      <li>I receive many comments on how people love how I smell and especially women.</li>
      <li>Found it finally on Amazon and am so glad because it is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, you might use this cologne when you go to work out at the gym or are outside walking.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny and will order again.</li>
      <li>so it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>I found it in a same mens clothing store and liked it for my self.</li>
      <li>It seems to be more of a mature scent, but it doesn&#x27;t have much depth or personality in my opinion.</li>
      <li>My husband has tried many others, but I keep making him go back to this one.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>The more that I used it, the more I realized that it&#x27;s smell lasted far longer than I expected.</li>
      <li>SO FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS THOUGHT IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE ; HAD MANY GREAT COMMENTS ABOUT SCRENT ;</li>
      <li>as a distinct masculine perfume that is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>This is the cologne that really gets me noticed.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely recommend it</li>
      <li>The manufacturer shipped this so fast.</li>
      <li>He told me and informed me that it was only available online.</li>
      <li>THANKS</li>
      <li>The first time I used Ultimo, I was presently surprised by</li>
      <li>was pleasantly surprised at the positive attention I was receiving concerning Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It kind of reminds me of a less intense version of Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male fragrance.</li>
      <li>Has also perked up the love life a little as well..</li>
      <li>ULTIMO IS MY NEW FRAGRANCE.</li>
      <li>My first experience with this fragrance was noticing it on the owner of a local men&#x27;s store.</li>
      <li>In fact, it is so frequent and so flattering, that it gets a bit embarrassing after a while.</li>
      <li>I have never in my life attracted so many unsolicited and extremely complementary comments from other women as when I wear Ultimo.</li>
      <li>When I ran out I searched high &amp; low for this product with very little success until I found it on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>It has such a soft scent and lasting.  </li>
</ol>

<li> I&#x27;ve been looking for Ultimo since the store closed.</li>
<li> A ton of other colognes embarrass this cologne.</li>
<li> but not worth the money</li>

<li> Very few, in fact.</li>
<li> Hard to find it in the store.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m VERY anxious to give it to him for Christmas</li>
<li> it&#x27;s  subtle but intoxicating scent.</li>
<li> When I noticed the next morning that I could still smell his cologne (and not in a bad way), I had to ask him what was he wearing.</li>
<li> Very hard to find in stores!</li>
<li> This is the cologne that my boyfriend uses and was unable to find it anywhere, i was determined to find it, I did</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne.</li>

    <li> this is the best cologne any man can buy it&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> Third bottle I have had.  Great stuff!  Had many compliments.  Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> My first experience with this fragrance was noticing it on the owner of a local men&#x27;s store. He gave me a sample for my husband to try &amp; I was hooked. The fragrance is intoxicating - a \\&quot;can&#x27;t say no\\&quot; smell to me. This is the 3rd bottle I&#x27;ve purchased over the years. Love it, love it, love it (&amp; my husband loves its affect on me)!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for a number of years. I have ordered it through \\&quot;you\\&quot; the last time I ordered some. However, I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE MY ORDER!!! I don&#x27;t know how to get someone to check where my order has gone. I need your help</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  Bought it at a men&#x27;s clothing store several years ago and could not find it anywhere when the store closed.  Found it finally on Amazon and am so glad because it is my favorite.  I ordered it and the package came within a couple days.  Now I know who has it and where to order again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it and the price was great!</li>
    <li> Compliments galore from the ladies when wearing this cologne. Smell lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It smells divine and does not irritate my allergies, so now my man can smell as good as he looks. The manufacturer shipped this so fast.</li>
    <li> Very light smell..my husband is a Barber so this is perfect light light scent</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne. It has a great scent; this is one of my all time favorites.</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t wear many colognes. Very few, in fact. We always purchased Ultimo from a local merchant.  When the store owner decide to close, he won&#x27;t tell us where he got it. I&#x27;ve been looking for Ultimo since the store closed. My husband ran out of it some time ago, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It smells nice, is not over powering, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my husband&#x27;s skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> Have used it for several years.  Hard to find it in the store.  My wife thinks it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s known.</li>
    <li> This cologne is just what I had been looking for. This is the cologne that really gets me noticed. Thank you</li>
    <li> I HAD USED THIS PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YRS AND WAS TOLD BY SUPPLIER THAT IT HAD BEEN DISCONTINUED ; SO FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS THOUGHT IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE ; HAD MANY GREAT COMMENTS ABOUT SCRENT ;THANKS</li>
    <li> I understand that there are different odors and smells that attract the opposite sex, the explanation of which is a bit beyond me. But guys like women that smell of great perfume, and women are attracted to men that smell certain ways. I have never in my life attracted so many unsolicited and extremely complementary comments from other women as when I wear Ultimo. In fact, it is so frequent and so flattering, that it gets a bit embarrassing after a while. Clay Lifto Author of [[ASIN:1478710349 Only a Soldier Understands]]</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance on my husband!</li>
    <li> The best men&#x27;s cologne out there! Very hard to find in stores! Fast shipping! Will buy from again! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne. Everyone compliments you on how good you smell.</li>
    <li> not as good as the reviews here..its ok..but not worth the money</li>
    <li> Um, yumm. If you want your man to smell handsome, this works.  Women are always asking him the name of the cologne all the time. I smelled it on another man and ordered it inline that night. Worth every penny and will order again.</li>
    <li> Took me years to find this after getting a sample bottle in a gift basket for Christmas years ago.  Never thought to just look on Amazon.  It&#x27;s very light, a simple spray will do you for a day, and it&#x27;s a great clean scent.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND DISCOVERED THIS COLOGNE AND WHEN I TRIED IT I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN SO I ORDERED MY OWN BOTTLE AND DARED HIM TO TOUCH IT..... HE AND I WEAR IT EVERYDAY .... I GOT RID OF MY PERFUME. ULTIMO IS MY NEW FRAGRANCE.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite cologne! My husband has tried many others, but I keep making him go back to this one. I can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over for this for a gift for my man who used to wear this when we started dating.</li>
    <li> Ultimo Cologne in my opinion is the top cologne for men.  The fragrance last for days. The aroma is out of site.  The odor        arising from the colonge can&#x27;t be outdone.  When I have it on People ask me what is that you have on?  I only tell them         the name of what I am wearing, not where I purchased it from.  You see I want to be the only one smelling so good.        I would recomend MEN buy ultimo Colonge if you can it.        .</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it too. Can&#x27;t keep her off of me. It smells very clean and fresh. I would absolutely recommend it</li>
    <li> I work in the medical field and I recently had a patient overnight that was wearing this cologne. When I noticed the next morning that I could still smell his cologne (and not in a bad way), I had to ask him what was he wearing. He told me and informed me that it was only available online. Thank you AMAZON for having this product. I love this stuff. I am always getting rave reviews from anyone around me when I wear this. Has also perked up the love life a little as well..lol. Thought it was a little pricey at first, but a little goes a very long way so it is well worth it. Please don&#x27;t ever stop carrying this cologne.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Got some compliments from some women...and some men.</li>
    <li> I have tried over 40 colognes. There is no way this is a 5.  It&#x27;s basically a powder smelling cologne which I&#x27;m not a big fan of. Honestly, you might use this cologne when you go to work out at the gym or are outside walking. I would never use this stuff in any place with women. A ton of other colognes embarrass this cologne.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot  of colognes, and this is a good one!!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used Ultimo, I was presently surprised by it&#x27;s  subtle but intoxicating scent. The more that I used it, the more I realized that it&#x27;s smell lasted far longer than I expected. Everyone (women in particular) would ask me what kind of Cologne I was wearing and where could they purchase it for their husband or boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised at the positive attention I was receiving concerning Cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimo has met my every expectation and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;Rev. William N. Pee</li>
    <li> I first got a small sample bottle at a men&#x27;s clothing store some years ago.  I loved it then but I was too cheap to spend $50 for a bottle of cologne. Well, this year I splurged and am glad I did. The manly scent lasts 24+ hours and does not dissappoint. My wife loves it also, and that counts!!</li>
    <li> The scent has that powdery quality that polo double black has. It&#x27;s not bad, but I&#x27;m not that into powder scents. It kind of reminds me of a less intense version of Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s Le Male fragrance. It seems to be more of a mature scent, but it doesn&#x27;t have much depth or personality in my opinion. I&#x27;m basing my opinion on a sample that came in the mail, so maybe I didn&#x27;t get a proper sample.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance.  When I ran out I searched high &amp; low for this product with very little success until I found it on Amazon.com.  I am extremely happy and excited knowing I can replenish or purchase through Amazon when I need to in the future.</li>
    <li> Great smell!  Gave it to my brother as a gift and he loves it!  Said he would buy this cologne again.</li>
    <li> as a distinct masculine perfume that is not overpowering.  I have had nothing but compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is the cologne that my boyfriend uses and was unable to find it anywhere, i was determined to find it, I did and I&#x27;m VERY anxious to give it to him for Christmas so I can smell it again...</li>
    <li> I have used Ultimo for years.  It has such a soft scent and lasting.  Women love it.  I receive many comments on how people love how I smell and especially women.</li>
    <li> same as above. And so why do I need seventeen more words to say the exact same&lt;br /&gt;thing again? Huh?</li>
    <li> Great scent last all day</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever had; hands down!  Would not change a thing.  Great service all around.  Guys, it makes the gals get closer.</li>
    <li> I have used Ultimo for about 20 years now. I found it in a same mens clothing store and liked it for my self. Even though it&#x27;s a mans cologne I get compliments on it all the time. My son found it in my room and starting using it. So now I have to order double.</li>
