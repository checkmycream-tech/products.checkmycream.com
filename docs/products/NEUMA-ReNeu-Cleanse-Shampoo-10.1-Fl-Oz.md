      <li>Good for my children with allergies.</li>
      <li>Very pleased all around.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>Nice product nice results</li>
      <li>My salon switched to this line and so glad they did.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Along with occasional Tee Tree Oil use, my scalp is in great shape!</li>
      <li>And, this shampoo is safe for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair look and feel, along with the fact that it&#x27;s environmentally friendly, which is very important to me.</li>
      <li>Along with some really great natural ingredients it has thistle and rose hips...both are natural astringents which is what we need.</li>
      <li>I like using this shampoo because it makes my hair feel clean.  </li>
      <li>Seems to stay clean longer.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo is fine, but it says its, all natural and it is full of chemicals including sodium laurel sulphate</li>
      <li>The moisturizing is great if you need the extra moisture, but I was not a big fan of the Volume line.  </li>
      <li>A really fine natural shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have fine, but a lot of it, naturally curly hair that I straighten quite a bit.  </li>
      <li>Sensitive scalp, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>So, even though it may seem a little pricey, it has good value because you get a lot of washes out of every bottle.</li>
      <li>But this shampoo does a better job than the dandruff and speciality shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
      <li>Cleans well but not harsh</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this and the conditioner for anyone who has similar skin conditions.</li>
      <li>Also, I am conscious of only using what I need &amp; not being wasteful with it.</li>
      <li>And, like the other Neuma shampoos and conditioners, you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
      <li>Great natural base.</li>
      <li>but I do not feel the combination worked well for my fine, thin hair.</li>

    <li> Smells good.  Too heavy if I use nothing but it so switch off/on with other shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love it. Great Clarifying Shampoo. Made my scalp tingle. Has a peppermint smell. Be careful getting in you eyes because it will burn.</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the hype is about.  This didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> My salon switched to this line and so glad they did.

    <li> Awesome shampoo !  I get relief from psoriasis as well as gorgeous hair with great body and texture !  Great product</li>
    <li> packaging leaked and I lost some product.</li>
    <li> Received just as expected, at a lot cheaper price than in the salon!.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a great cleanser for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. .I use less than a quarter sized amount on my medium-long hair !!&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Have been using this over a year  now - smells great, works great.  All I need...</li>
    <li> Nice product nice results</li>
    <li> I like using this shampoo because it makes my hair feel clean.  And, like the other Neuma shampoos and conditioners, you don&#x27;t need much.  So, even though it may seem a little pricey, it has good value because you get a lot of washes out of every bottle.</li>
    <li> A really fine natural shampoo. I like the way it cleans my hair. Its pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Pleasant scent. Cleans well but not harsh</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is fine, but it says its, all natural and it is full of chemicals including sodium laurel sulphate</li>
    <li> I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis and eczema at what is considered a moderate to sometimes severe case. I began using the Neuma Renau Shampoo over a year ago and could not be happier with the results. It didn&#x27;t cure either...there is no cure. But this shampoo does a better job than the dandruff and speciality shampoos I&#x27;ve tried in the past. And, this shampoo is safe for color treated hair. The price is almost the same as those dandruff shampoos and you get the added bonus of saving your expensive highlights. The Reneu type is the only one I have found to have the qualities to assist in helping my skin condition. Along with some really great natural ingredients it has thistle and rose hips...both are natural astringents which is what we need. It saves our color because there&#x27;s no sulfar and the alcohol content is low compared to other brands. I highly recommend this and the conditioner for anyone who has similar skin conditions. Along with occasional Tee Tree Oil use, my scalp is in great shape!</li>
    <li> I used with the Neuma Volume conditioner but I do not feel the combination worked well for my fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> Works for me.  Sensitive scalp, fine hair.  Seems to stay clean longer.  Don&#x27;t understand how that works.</li>
    <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t so expensive because it is my favorite shampoo and I can only afford to buy it once or twice a year.  I only use it a few times a month as a treat for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great natural base. Good for my children with allergies.</li>
    <li> My niece, who lives in California, brought me samples of this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I have to tell you that I have been using it for close to a year now &amp; my hair is in its best condition ever.  I also have tried the Neuma Moisture &amp; Neuma Volume shampoo &amp; conditioner.  The moisturizing is great if you need the extra moisture, but I was not a big fan of the Volume line.  I have fine, but a lot of it, naturally curly hair that I straighten quite a bit.  There is not a line that I have tried that compares to Nuema Renew.  I wish that my local Ulta carried this product, but I can only find it on Amazon. The price is steep, but the 25.4 fl. oz. lasts me quite a while.  Also, I am conscious of only using what I need &amp; not being wasteful with it.</li>
