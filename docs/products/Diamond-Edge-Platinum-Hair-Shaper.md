<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Was painful for my daughter who is ten. Her head is tender and the blade hers dull fast. Buy extra blades of you get this. It was not bad but I think I&#x27;ll just use my scissors.</li>
    <li> not what i expected but too bulky in your hands</li>
    <li> CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. Quality was so poor that I couldn&#x27;t cut my hair with it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair, this product actually helped me thin it out and shape a little. It does not come with instructions so I would recommend Google searching the product and hair cutting tips. Very easy to use and it does the job well. Some of the attachments need to be pinched on because they will come off easily but other than those few minor things it actually does work well.</li>
    <li> i went to use it and the head keeps coming off. It is really hard to try and use it is the head won&#x27;t stay on. It would also be nice to know what each one of those attachments do before we go and use them on hair. I searched and couldnt find any information</li>
    <li> This is my first straight razor. It is about 50X faster than using scissors to cut your hair. Razor doesnt rust, and the whole thing comes apart easily for cleaning and drying. The handle is durable and sturdy, but I wish it had come with a little carry bag or something to put the spare clips in.</li>
    <li> So I used bought a hair razor to save money on a fancy new haircut. I wanted bangs and to lighten the weight of my hair and add texture by razoring here and there. Never done it before so I was careful in finding a product that was cheap but efficient. Overall it will do the job but really it is all about technique. Maybe with a little practice it would be easier but for first time users be careful. I cut my hair wrong and ended up at the salon anyways. I asked her to use the razor blade to achieve the effect I wanted. She was going crazy with it (I have - or had - really long hair) and now my hair is a lot lighter and has body. I couldn&#x27;t do the same with the razor on my own hair all over, just the bangs. So if you&#x27;re getting it for a DIY job, ask a friend to help. Basically, the product is sturdy, sharp, easy to clean, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a need for the attachments since I&#x27;ve seen professionals use only one style of blade.</li>
    <li> Cuts hair well. Actually bought it to trim hair on a long haired cat that doesn&#x27;t tolerate electric trimmers. This tool is great because it&#x27;s just like brushing the cat but I can remove small amounts of fur without terrorizing my cat.</li>
    <li> This definitely wasn&#x27;t sharp enough. It didn&#x27;t cut any hair, even when I applied a lot of force. I&#x27;m returning it. I&#x27;ll just keep using my regular shaving razor to maintain that feathered look on my mullet.</li>
    <li> Could be me, but I expected the shaping attachments to made of hardened/non flimsy metal.  They look good, but due to a shaping attachments bending, I was somewhat disappointed.  I have not yet put them to use,  but expect to do that in the not too distant future.</li>
    <li> I got these so I could style my cosplay wigs better and they are absolutely fabulous. They&#x27;re easy to use and cut my wigs pretty good</li>
    <li> I really needed it but didn&#x27;t know where could I get it. Thanks to this \\&quot;Cosmetic Solutions\\&quot; for offering it on Amazon. Everything was perfect, great to do business with.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing i thinned my hair and razored in about 20mins. Is a good product if u know how to use it. If the razor is not as sharp as you want it, buy a new one &gt;.&gt;</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go to the same barber twice because they start to cut your hair the way they want.  The Diamond Edge is my answer to that problem.  You have to find the righy angel and take a little at a time, but I know what I want .  Lots of options with the four blades.  A little more practice with an electric trimmer and the Diamond Edge and I may never see a barber again.</li>
    <li> Was not comfortable for long time use.  Feels cheap.  The pin the holds the guards in place came off almost immediately and vanished.</li>
    <li> Terrible, dull, painful I threw it away.</li>
    <li> When ordering this product it stated they had two in stock... still don&#x27;t have it after nearly a month! Emailed several times and get the run around. This kind of customer service is why people stop ordering online.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what the description states a hair shaper? If you are expecting more of a hair trimmer and split end remover, like I was, forget it! The handle is cheesy lite weight plastic and the blade is not nearly sharp as a Shick injector bade, if you are old enough to remember those razors. Another big down side is only one cutting blade. The attachments most surely were stamped out from a flattened aluminum can. I am keeping this Shaper strictly as a reminder that \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; This Shaper would be the \\&quot;Bell of the Ball\\&quot; on an infomercial or QVC!</li>
    <li> Not ba at all for the price!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought one of these before, and didn&#x27;t realize the range of quality available. Based on the sound it makes when cutting through hair and the force required I&#x27;m sure it causes damage to the hair. My hair stylist uses something similar on my hair but it works better. I&#x27;m going to have to buy another one and be prepared to spend a lot more for a salon quality product.</li>
    <li> This Hair Razor does cut the hair, but you need to learn which blade to use or else a blade can cut too much hair or trim very few hair. The blade isn&#x27;t as sharp as I thought because your hair would be damaged a bit at the end of cutting.</li>
    <li> Took a little &amp;#34;getting used to&amp;#34; - but once you&#x27;ve &amp;#34;got it&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s intuitive AND it&#x27;s pretty much &amp;#34;goof proof&amp;#34;.  I do love it! Wear my hair short and this will save me a &amp;#34;bundle&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a really solid hair shaper, but the components feel kind of cheap.  But this shaper is $6 so for everyone [including me] that have high expectations on the craftsmanship, either get over those expectations, or find another shaper.  I will say that once I got over the cheap components, the shaper performed very well.</li>
    <li> It is dangerous to use because the attachments that cover the razor just slide around and off easily. You could really do some damage with this thing if they slide off! There is a locking screw on the blade. If the attachments were long enough and had a hole that you could secure them in place, this would resolve this problem. Poor design makes this item dangerous.</li>
    <li> Had a friend use these to cut my hair! Very sharp and acurate, everyone thinks I went to a salon. Great value for the price!</li>
    <li> I just got my hair shaper in the mail and immediately used it to trim and shape my own hair.  My husband is next as this little cutter will make his haircuts last a lot longer.  I might even learn how to do his hair myself and save the cost of barber cuts--assuming I can do his head without balding him!  The cutter works very well, even though there are no instructions. I had to figure out how to use it on my own. There really is no information on the packaging whatsoever, just the name and address of the company (and Made in China, of course!). It seems sturdily made.  Although it has no storage pouch a ziplock bags works just fine.  I am already ordering a second set so that I have plenty of blades and a second handle for the months and years to come.</li>
    <li> The Diamond Edge Platinum Hair Shaper was fun and easy to use. I was able to thin out my hair to the desired level, by myself, in about an hour - as it was my first time cutting my hair. The product itself is an excellent product. I mean, for $5 it simply is a must-have. I would recommend this to everyone with thick hair, or even those that would like a quick touch up without having to pay $30 for an inessential haircut. Like the perfect coverup and the convenient flatiron, every girl should have the Diamond Edge Platinum Hair Shaper.</li>
    <li> It does just what I wanted it to do. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had never used a Hair Shaper Razor &amp; I knew I could find a good priced one on Amazon. I am very happy w/ selecting this one. It was very easy to use. I did read all the reviews of this Shaper/Razor &amp; others like it, before I purchased this one. I also searched for &amp; watched online videos of how to use one. It made it much easier to know how to use it correctly. Hair has to be wet or it pulls- I have very long hair, so I keep a water bottle nearby when my hair starts to dry, because it does take some time for my hair. I also learned it is easier to let someone else do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I did not give 5 starts, because one of the razors does not fit snuggly &amp; constantly falls out &amp; it would happen to be the one I like to use. But it really was a great purchase!!  great price--always please shopping on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Great razor and great seller</li>
    <li> It is great for trimming thick hair, expecially bangs!  But I did think this would come with some instructions.  I guess it being a professional product; its assumed one would know what to do with it.  It does have a sharp edge, but I&#x27;ve really never bought blades of this kind before.  I might have to pop in my local Sally&#x27;s to see what blades it uses.  Maybe my local drug store will have them cheaper.</li>
    <li> edit: I love this item..disregard my other comment. I know do NOT have to go to a hairdresser and tell them what I want, then for them to mess it up for the 3rd time..I love IT. Every teen girl should own this :)</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive home hair care item that comes in handy for thinning your hair and trimming up around the edges.</li>
    <li> Tried it on my fine haired cat and on my own not so fine haired back of my neck. In both cases it cut almost no hair. On the cat I actually had to use one hand to pull the hair into the device to get it to cut at all. The blade(no extras are provided)is dull and the structure is cheesy. Promoting this thing as a hair cutting device amounts to fraud.</li>
    <li> The razor broke on me first time using it.  Tthe screws came out</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> For the price .work excellent.</li>
    <li> This hair trimmer works really well! Just be careful and don&#x27;t get too carried away until you learn how to work with it as it can take off a lot of hair. It&#x27;s sharp and has easily replaced blades when needed.</li>
    <li> For 6 dollars this thing does the same thing as a more expensive razor comb and its pretty durable i do not regret my purchase.</li>
    <li> these arrived with a razor blade so dull that it won&#x27;t even cut my hair.  It is 100% useless, cannot be used at all - pointless purchase. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Good blade, has withstood several haircuts so far without needing replacement.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000PUK8E8 Personna Replacement Hair Shapers Blades (60 Blades) sp#8800]]-- These Personna replacement blades do work for the Diamond Edge Platinum Hair Shaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Diamond Edge Platinum Hair Shaper works great. I think the reason why some people give this item bad ratings is because they are not holding the shaper at a 90 degree angle or continue to use dull blades.  I&#x27;ve done two hair cuttings on each of my dogs already and do not have to replace the blade yet.  I plan on buying another hair shaper and donating it to an animal shelter.  This is so that the animals that are scared easily by electric clippers can be groomed manually with the hair shaper (and become more adoptable too!). This hair shaper is a great compliment to using a [[ASIN:B000FSN0A4 FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch Edge]]  on animals .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet used this tool on humans but I do plan to use it on my own hair (I sometimes cut my hair with stylist scissors).  I will amend this 5 star review if needed but I don&#x27;t think I will have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a tip: dirt can dull blades so dabbing some oil on the razer should help keep the razer in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit, I have have amended this review to a 4 star because of this design problem: over time the razer can get loose but i tend to deal with tangles and thick thick hair (I own more than one of these shapers).  If you&#x27;re planning to use it for light duty jobs you may never encounter loose razers.  It&#x27;s true that the makers could have designed it better so the razer stays in place (even with thick hair and tangles) but a little bit of pressure from your thumb on it during hair shaping and using pliers to crimp the shaper around the razer will keep it in place.  However, it also mars the shaper.  It only means that I have to use pliers every time to replace the razer. It would all be unnecessary though if the design was better for heavy duty use but it&#x27;s inexpensive to buy and I believe I would never have encountered this if i only had light duty jobs.  Would I buy this again?  Yes... unless I found something better and then I would also be willing to pay more too.ould never have encountered this if i only had light duty jobs.

    <li> I have always liked a strait edge razor with a guard.  I hate to have my hair cut so I stretch in between.  Get a piece poking out and cut it off with the razor.  Works for me.  It is sharp and I got a package of replacement blades.</li>
    <li> this is one of the 2 razors i bought off amazon, this is also my least favorite. it&#x27;s so dull compared to the other one. its also awkward to hold. its bulky in my drawer too.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT IF YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THIS. IF NOT YOU WILL GET VERY UNEVEN HAIR SHAPING. TAKE YOUR TIME USING THIS.</li>
    <li> Great product I wish I had gotten it sooner. I can cut my own hair now so no more trips to the salon. It was so easy, I couldn&#x27;t find instructions on the internet so just went at it. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do a full hair cut with it. Either the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough or the guard catches the hair. It&#x27;s great for adding different textures but I still prefer a different one when I razor the ends when I don&#x27;t use scissor.</li>
    <li> Not satisfied ,little comb falling of from razor blades ...not safe :(</li>
    <li> The blade that come with it is very dull, at least mine was anyways. Save yourself the hassle and purchase some replacement blades to go with it.</li>
    <li> Very sharp- be careful when grooming pets!!!</li>
    <li> Great simple tool that can be used to easily create a layered hairstyle. Does the job well at a very good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try and trim down my pug yorkie mix...Within a few passes, they fell apart. I would suggest spending a few more dollars and getting a better pair</li>
    <li> when i received this item I was very pleased with the construction and materials used, they look to be very good</li>
    <li> Not as easy to use on myself as the least expensive little comb/razer cutter, actually.  Would be easier to use cutting somebody else&#x27;s hair, but I think I should have spent a little more for something a little better.  They do the job though, for the money.</li>
    <li> SO GREAT FOR THE MONEY.</li>
    <li> I buy this item for my husband so I have no idea whether it was effective or not or even worked. Since he told me nothing .</li>
    <li> You have to be careful when choosing tool, try the shallower comb first as the deep one cuts long strands and may be too much. Also, be careful of the angle you use in going through your hair.Keep it consistent as you follow the round of your head. Do NOT scoop towards the end of your stroke. The severe angle cuts a LOT of hair and flat spots are not what you want!</li>
    <li> Very impressed, does a great job, extremely sharp. Good quality.  Like the differnt attachments. Would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> I would caution prospective buyers that &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; when using this product. Go easy. When I use it to thin out my hair, I always seem to end up with much shorter hair than I intended.</li>
    <li> This thing will absolutely not cut a single hair. All it does is pinch and pull. I wouldnt dare try to sell this.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s so easy to figure out how to use. I did my 7 yr olds hair, which is curly but this year she wants me to straighten it for her and the bottom of her hair was hard to get even because it was so thick, so I took this and razored out the bottom so I have less to get straight. Then I took it and gave her long side bangs and blended it all in, with in 30 minutes of opening this. I thinned out my own layers and I have really long hair so it was super easy and I was surprised. We look great. I have two teens that my stylist always uses a razor on, it looks great but grows out fast so they are always getting their hair done....now I can do it myself, shape their layers and cut dead ends with out a problem and save money. Now we can always look polished and pampered. I have not studied to do hair yet so if I can use it, you can use it.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It works fine, thank you for asking.</li>
    <li> Easy to use to maintain hair in between salon visits, even for non-professional.</li>
    <li> I have to give this 5 stars because it did everything I bought it to do.  I have short close cropped hair.  Usually my sides, where my hair fades and blends into the top, get bushy in between haircuts.  The razor that was on the handle when I opened package is the one I used.  I can see how some people complain about the pinching that their children feel, but at 34 years old the pinch didn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest bit.  If you are looking for a tool to reduce bushiness or bulk in between cuts, this should work great for you.</li>
    <li> This is a nifty little razor cutter. I haven&#x27;t gotten to play around with all the different comb parts, but the blade is very sharp and cuts easily. The weight and style of it is much better than the last one I owned, and I&#x27;m going to probably pick up another of these for back up. It added great texture to my hair while taking out some of the weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it&#x27;s not getting a 5 star review is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case. It&#x27;s got 4 combs, and it should come with some kind of pouch.</li>
    <li> These do not cut my dog&#x27;s hair at all well.I  am not sure if anything would do better except animal shears which he does not like due to the noise .  Would not recommend them</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair (short) with this tool and it actually turned out well! The blade itself is removable and, I assume, replaceable-- a nice if unexpected feature.</li>
    <li> This set is good for the price. The handle is comfortable and the tang is nice. The indentation for the thumb is a nice touch. The guards are okay and would be good for someone who does not feel comfortable enough to do different techniques without a guard. A proffessional does not need all the different heads. I would not recommend this for a novice since only trained proffessionals should use a straight edge. I would recommend it for someone in Beauty school or recently graduated.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as well as I would like.  It really hacks at the hair instead of cutting cleanly.  I tried it several times and no longer use it.</li>
    <li> I use this on my long haired cat. She doesn&#x27;t mind, she just sits there and lets me comb her.</li>
    <li> unusual i watch video great</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for... and affordable too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set for my daughter&#x27;s cosmetology course. She loved it.</li>
    <li> I am a female with short hair.  I find this product wonderful for tapering my hairstyle.  The product is sturdy and easy to control.</li>
    <li> The product description states that this comes with 3 platinum blades, but it actually only comes with 1 cutting blade and the 4 attachments which slip over the blade supposedly to create different effects (No instructions were included, so I guess you&#x27;re just supposed to start hacking away at your hair and see what effect is created with each attachment. No Thanks!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this is not a precision styling tool. The attachments don&#x27;t seem to slip on securely, so they move back and forth a little while trying to cut and the handle is plastic. (Mass produced in China, so expected.) I guess if you&#x27;re just looking to shear away clumps of hair for a choppy effect this would do the trick. In addition, others have stated that the blade seems a little dull which defeats the purpose of razor precision. I purchased this in hopes of blending and cleaning up stray hairs (I&#x27;m a guy with short, gray hair and wiry hairs are always sticking out looking messy.) This blade wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to do the precision type of detailing that I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and invested in the more expensive [[ASIN:B00491G5JQ Kamisori H4 Razor Professional Hair Styling Razor]]. Now that&#x27;s a razor! High quality, solid stainless steel construction, ergonomic grip and a super sharp razor for that clean sheared effect. Kamisori is a well respected Japanese company in the industry that makes very expensive, high end styling shears, so I trust the quality. Paying more was worth it for me when it comes to my hair. They also have a more economical, but still high quality option here: [[ASIN:B004A80LFM Kamisori H-3 Silver Razor (blue) Professional Hair Styling Razor]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest unless you&#x27;re using this razor to cut your pet&#x27;s hair, invest a little more and go for a better quality razor on your own hair.</li>
    <li> Great, sharp, gets job done, perfect for thinning out thick course hair, shag cuts, wispy bangs etcetera, etcetera... great all the way plus fast shipping woohooo thank you!!</li>
    <li> First off, yes, you need to know what you&#x27;re doing with this or else you will cut off more hair than you&#x27;d like. But, when you first use a hair tool, do not be surprised if you&#x27;re not a master at hair cutting when you get the product. It works well for my needs and yes, you do need to be careful when using it. Also, when &#x27;cutting&#x27; or &#x27;shaping&#x27; your hair, for best results, use it on damp hair or it may be difficult to get through your hair.</li>
    <li> I just wish they had a straight-edge one, but obviously that wasn&#x27;t anything I didn&#x27;t know before buying this product.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo15LBQT801O8HB]]I purchased this Diamond Edge Platinum Hair Shaper for grooming my two medium-hair cats. The spring-to-summer transition is usually when they shed the most, and if I don&#x27;t groom them religiously, tumbleweeds of cat fur will start to appear in the house. So I decided to give this a try. Unfortunately, I am not capable of cutting my own hair, so my review will be as a pet groomer and not a hair shaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with ONLY ONE BLADE in the package, and 4 attachments. The blade is 2 1/4 x 1/2 inch, I believe it is a standard razor size. The handle is appx 5 inches long. I have small hands and have no problem handling it. Overall, it is lightweight, easy to handle, and the quality is decent for the price. However, the quality can definitely be further improved. With the attachment on, the shaper is more likely to snag (my cats have very fine to fine hair, human hair is more coarse in comparison) , and I noticed with the attachments on, the blade tends to slide out while cutting, which is extremely dangerous. Eventually, I just threw the attachments in to drawer and just used the blades only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, more about using the shaper as a pet groomer. I am not a professional groomer, but I have played with my cats enough to know when they are in the grooming mode. They are very used to being groomed by brushes, combs, [[ASIN:B001DYM62C Tinkle Hair Cutter]], and [[ASIN:B004MYPQCW Furminators]]. Please don&#x27;t use the razor on your pet when they are frisky. The razor is sharp, please handle carefully. If you are not confident with cat grooming, I recommend that you start with something like the [[ASIN:B001DYM62C Tinkle Hair Cutter]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I used furminator, cats like it, but it just takes forever and I can&#x27;t repeat the full grooming every few days. I have used scissors, but that leaves choppy cuts and my cats doesn&#x27;t like the sound of scissors. I also have used the [[ASIN:B001DYM62C Tinkle Hair Cutter]] and [[ASIN:B005HFAY22 Universal Unisex Razor Comb Home Hair Cut]], but both are a bit too long and too wide to handle. The Diamond Edge Platinum Hair Shaper is slim and easy to handle. Cuts effectively. The only negative concern is the safety. I usually pet the area first to make sure it&#x27;s safe to cut. I also place my hand about one inch away from where I&#x27;d start the blade, I believe this reduces the pulling from cutting and makes it more comfortable for the cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I uploaded the video of the close-ups of the shaper and cat grooming. I am new to video reviews, if you have any comments or suggestions, or anything you would like to know about this bag, please feel free to comment.Y22 Universal Unisex Razor Comb Home Hair Cut]], but both are a bit too long and too wide to handle.

    <li> this product is amazing, it is the prefect tool for hair bang triming. The best part is I can trim my hair bang by myself and i don&#x27;t have to deal with the reservation and hairstylist anymore .</li>
    <li> perfect.  diamond edge is great but they make other ones as well.</li>
    <li> Ive never had any problems with anything ... if it was damaged they send new.. if it is missing they replace it.</li>
    <li> Works really well, I have been cutting my boyfriend hair with this for quite a while. The interchangeable options are nice. The only thing I would say is that the blades are not super sharp, however, it does the job and makes for a nice cheap hair cut. You can get the hair to look just like a hairdresser would, it is super easy to use. (Tip: look up some youtube tutorials!) Great deal as well.</li>
    <li> It works all TOO GOOD!  OOOPS! The doggone guard slipped and I sliced a 3/4&amp;#34; gash in my wife&#x27;s ear!!!!!</li>
    <li> a little hard to handle but im no expert anyway, but this made shaping and texturizing my hair a breeze</li>
    <li> I usually have a hard time with my hair because it&#x27;s so thick. Whenever I&#x27;d get it done at a salon they would use a razor like this to layer and thin it. Lately, I&#x27;ve been just cutting my hair with a scissors, but then you can see uneven spots and you can&#x27;t really layer with a scissors. So when I saw this, I knew I just had to try it. I had to work up enough courage to use it cause I was afraid I&#x27;d make my hair look ridiculous, but when I finally did try it -- WOW!!! It was the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this because now I can save money on hair cuts and just do it myself at home. And it took barely any time at all. I have two children as well and I&#x27;ve been cutting their hair, now I&#x27;m going to use this for their hair so that it looks really nice for them too!</li>
    <li> For the cheap price, they do the trick.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me and has already been donated to Goodwill in hopes someone may find it useful.</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to use, really fast. You really can&#x27;t go wrong. It didn&#x27;t come with instructions but it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out. The blade gaurds come in 4 different styles, each providing a different cut. The cut aways on the gaurd is where your hair actually gets cut so the bigger the gaps in the gaurd the bigger the chunks of cut and not cut hair. Simply hold your hair firm and lightly pull down on the razor as you go.</li>
    <li> I love this razor and all the attachments. I love the design and hand feel of this one. I love that it has the little secure loop for your pinky to add stability. This is a great little razor and way better than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past where the blades and the attachments would fall off sometimes. This is well made really the only thing that I would change is for a couple spare blades to be tossed in because you only get 1 blade. Not a big issue though ;)</li>
    <li> The handle is cheap plastic, but you get what you pay for. I only wanted it for the different attachments and I am able to use them on my other razors as well, so I cant complain :)</li>
    <li> Works as expected. Liked the different combs that came with it. The blade is sharp enough to cut fine and thick curly hair which is good considering I have pretty thick hair. I used it to trim my hair without issues.</li>
    <li> I used it on the day it came, and it worked quite well.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. It doesn&#x27;t come with instructions or explain the difference between the guards. The blade it came with is not super sharp, but maybe it could be sharpened.</li>
    <li> Great for in-between hair cuts...pays for itself by reducing frequency of trips to my hair dresser.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s probably not thrilled, but I love it. My bangs especially tend to get heavy &amp; long so I can get that wispy look I like.&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement I would recommend is a tighter fit for attachments, they sometimes fall off before I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product!</li>
    <li> Great hair shaper. Comfortable grip. Would haven been five stars if it came with an extra blade.</li>
    <li> It works okay. I use this for doll hair after hand rooting it. If you are using it on an inanimate object, it should be okay but do not try to use this on a human. The way the blades set into the handle allows some pull when cutting. I think it would hurt if you were cutting someone&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t get to cut human hair, I use it to remove &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; from my cat&#x27;s fur-  She is recovering from a traumatic brain injury and has lost the ability to eat, uhh...., &#x27;neatly&#x27;! but this razor works very well, easy to control sharp. No complaints very grateful to have this product. Have also used it to remove hundreds of masking tape bits from my ferret&#x27;s coat. Don&#x27;t ask.Ferrets.</li>
    <li> It is work very good.  My wife is pleased with it</li>
    <li> The product arrived without a blade that was supposed to be included which makes it  useless.</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this Item</li>
    <li> That item worked well for me to shape my own hair - or to get a trim for Inbetween professional haircuts. The multi blades make it a fantastic styling medium. I can strongly recommend it. It is hard to goof up a style....</li>
    <li> I like to cut and style my own hair so I found this for a great price and couldnt say no, does a good job with layers, by far better than just a regular shaving blade!!lol</li>
    <li> if used carefully it does a great job...would recommend for male or female  hair cuts.. cheap and easy.. try it</li>
    <li> Even at $ 7 it is not worth it! Very poor quality and not worth it, don&#x27;t waste your money on this Chinese crape!</li>
    <li> Use this to trim back hair during self haircuts, Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used these before, but my boyfriend wanted me to try cutting his hair.  They work really well on wet hair, but not so great when the hair is dry.  I thought it was really easy to use and I would recommend this product to others, especially for this price.  Even if you only got one hair cut out of them, they would still be cheaper than a haircut at a salon.</li>
    <li> NO Instructions, so i have never used it. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Since I moved to a different area, I have been cutting my own hair.  I keep it very short (with clippers), but I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; look it gets when it grows out some.  The girl that used to cut my hair used one of these razors to razor the top a little which seemed to make it look a little nicer.  So, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  This razor is very easy to use (I just lightly go over the top/upper sides of my head, and it gives my hair a little more texture and a less &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Love the way it cuts hair is totally awesome like the idea of having different blade attachments does everything I expected it would do.</li>
    <li> This is the holy grail for short hair... instead of the chunky electric clippers, just pull this bad boy out and BAM, you&#x27;re on your way to an awesome hair cut. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairy dude. This product is great for quickly thinning out bushy arm/leg hair without making it look like you buzz and/or shave. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This was my fault for not reading thoroughly and knowing what I was getting into. I completely butchered my hair since I had no idea what I was doing. Oh well. 4 stars because the item was exactly as described and very effective. I recommend this to anyone who will know how to use it, trust me guys, it&#x27;s not for amateurs.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair very short to save it from a bad perm. I love this product. I can cut my hair in so different ways (short, that is)! Great to have it. I recommend it. Sharp, does the job.</li>
    <li> Resolves the issue or stray hairs, fixes mistakes for the most part and blends like magic. If you&#x27;ve never used a hair shaper and you cut your own hair...you&#x27;re doing it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will make cutting your hair at home a lot more feasible and less of a chore. It works really well with a variety of hair styles, be forewarned that with a fresh new blade the cut is almost a little too close, it will take about 4 hair cuts before it&#x27;s safe to just pass through your hair with little attention, but if you just go at it without an idea of what you&#x27;re trying to achieve you could overly thin your hair or create a bald spot. You&#x27;ll get used to it&#x27;s precision after the first cut and it will become a natural feeling tool.</li>
    <li> Love cutting my hair with these tools!</li>
    <li> Perfect shaver. Feels better than the normal old school flip blades. My haircuts are coming out better than ever. Thanks!</li>
    <li> im gonna start by saying im a licensed cosmetologist and is used to using professional equipment in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought this so i didnt have to use my expensive razors/shears on a synthetic wig i got. it got the job done in the end but the covers you slide over the blade kept sliding off while you tug it through hair, you kinda have to hold it in place which really annoyed me considering i didnt have to on the ones i own. but on the other hand those were about $200. so basically thats my only complaint, other than that its great if you know how to use them,&lt;br /&gt;im impressed it worked this well for this price all in all</li>
    <li> Thanks to this baby I now can tidy up my pixie cut without having to go into the salon every 4 weeks. Has cut my hair style cost in half.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the product is great.  I use it on my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has a bob cut and it&#x27;s nice to be able to touch it up with these instead of running to the hair dressers.</li>
    <li> Have you ever tried to cut your own hair , ladies?  Well, this little gadget saved my vanity and maybe even acceptable to be in public.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional, but I saw online barely razoring the bottom of sections of hair will keep it from going flat and IT WORKED great.  I have been cutting my own hair for years and it has never looked better.  Product came promptly in efficient packaging.  The only problem I have is how to keep it in a place not accessible to children.  I have it hidden with obsolete hair cutters.  No one will ever look in there, lol.  Now I&#x27;ll have cool hair at a reasonable price.  Thank you. P.S. Could use a plastic case that made it difficult for the kids to get into?</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and was as described, but said it would work great to groom dogs but it doesn&#x27;t cut the way I expected, a bit disapointed with that.</li>
</ol>
