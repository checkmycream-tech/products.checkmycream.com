      <li>What I like about it is that it can help thinning hair have more texture and appear fuller.</li>

      <li>Redkin is among my favorite.</li>

      <li>The ladies love the spikey hair.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite product to use to mold my hair.</li>
      <li>My favorite molding paste.</li>
      <li>Find the most douchy bodyspray ie axe and spray it to a homeless person who hasn&#x27;t taken a shower in days.</li>
      <li>The redken roughpaste 12 is better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
      <li>A cream would proably work better.  </li>
      <li>works better for that.</li>
      <li>sure to shake the bottle before use.</li>
      <li>My hair looks a lot better with this molding paste.  </li>
      <li>The volume of product is pretty good for the price (lasts me about 1.5 months using every day).</li>
      <li>Also, it smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>but it does seem to be pretty good for what you will pay.</li>
      <li>I would say it gives more of a medium-strong hold than a completely strong hold.</li>
      <li>My 16 year old bought it and is happy with the results.</li>
      <li>rarely buy products at a salon because it seems like they&#x27;re over priced, but I liked how this paste made my hair look</li>
      <li>Other than that, its perfect and</li>
      <li>I like matte style it provides, and I like how it&#x27;s liquidy so that you can easily put it through all of your hair</li>
      <li>It styles nicely without crisp or oily hair.</li>
      <li>so I could get out a smooth amount of paste, but</li>
      <li>Wish this was available in stores.</li>
      <li>I will not purchase again nor recommend this seller it is a cheap knock off.</li>
      <li>and it gave indeed medium control over my hair, worked great for short hair on city nights..</li>
      <li>Nice hold, reshapeable, but makes my hair stick straight up and in strands</li>
      <li>I think that the product I purchased, namely the one listed above, met my expectations and has been working great.</li>
      <li>So quick and easy to style my hair.  </li>
      <li>and he&#x27;s looking pretty sexy, so</li>
      <li>Best stuff for thick hair</li>
      <li>I love the stuff, it holds your hair but not too much.  </li>
      <li>I love this so much.  </li>
      <li>Great for fine limp hair.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>But i reccommend this stuff very much!</li>
      <li>Either way the product is very moldable and easy to work through hair.</li>
      <li>It gives you a great hold that last pretty much all day.</li>
      <li>It does not seem strong enough which is the &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; of most preparations.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, isn&#x27;t real heavy and just works great.</li>
      <li>Quick dispense is just the right amount each time to give me the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
      <li>I love this hair product because it&#x27;s not stiff but yet holds the hair in place</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this stuff and its great for my son&#x27;s Mohawk, it holds it up great, dies pretty fast abd doesn&#x27;t leave it too sticky or flakey afterwards. lasts all day as long as he doesn&#x27;t roll around too much (he&#x27;s 5) No mess and it smells great.</li>
    <li> it  gets a little clumpy sometimes when u use it sparingly but u can just wipe it off with your finger .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;make sure to shake the bottle before use. and rub it in your palms so the cream doesnt show in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;solid product from redken.</li>
    <li> Bought this on Amazon for the convenience. The pricing wasn&#x27;t a great deal, but it saved me from making a trip to a salon just for product.</li>
    <li> First off, i have really thin and WEAK hair.. I used to use Redken Rewind 06 styling paste [[ASIN:B002RT71ZY Redken Rewind Pliable Paste, 5-Ounces Bottle]] and it gave indeed medium control over my hair, worked great for short hair on city nights.. But going to the beach with all the wind, or when hair started to get longer it wasnt useful anymore, so i had to get something new.. I looked up online and found this product, when to nearest salon to get it. first time i used it i just said, THIS REALLY IS MAXIMUM CONTROL (you will notice if you have previously used the 06 rewind).. lets you style your hair ANYWAY you want, you can even style the same you used to but breeze and wind wont get it out of place (go ahead and lower the windshield on the highway to the beach) Doesn&#x27;t smell at all, decent amount for the price (got it for $14) and also works on medium length hair, for long hair gel would be better though.   I still use the rewind when i have short hair on city nights when im going indoor because it feels softer on the hair and you can run your hand through it without any trouble.. I dont recommend running hand through hair with this on.  In general, I&#x27;d recommend this, like another reviewer said, to anyone who has hair!  If youve never used any hair products before, be sure to start here.. you wont go back</li>
    <li> The bottle was bigger than I thought it was going to be. Should last quite a while. It seems like its more of a cream rather than a paste though. I would say it gives more of a medium-strong hold than a completely strong hold. I have only used it a few times so far but it does seem to be pretty good for what you will pay. That being said, I would either mix it will something will more hold or use a stronger product after using this one. This product is good for getting hair to go where you want it to but something that has a stronger hold would be good to use for texture.</li>
    <li> Wish this was available in stores. Quick shipping. Decent price. Great product that leaves hair manageable and not \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; or greasy. Recommended to guys who just can&#x27;t seem to find the right product.</li>
    <li> I am a 50 year old guy with very little experience with hair products. After viewing a couple of YouTube videos on how to use hair gel, I have used this product successfully. What I like about it is that it can help thinning hair have more texture and appear fuller. You can also just run your fingers through your hair later in the day to appear neater.</li>
    <li> The product does what it says.. leaves your hair very matt. I personally add a little hairspray after I style my hair. The product has one defect through, the smell. It seriously smells horrible, I&#x27;d compare it to something, but it&#x27;s a unique chemical smell. Works great, though.</li>
    <li> Great product (&amp; price!)</li>
    <li> good stuff. I buy this stuff all the time. I like this stuff. It&#x27;s actually cheaper through amazon than it is in the stores here. I like matte style it provides, and I like how it&#x27;s liquidy so that you can easily put it through all of your hair then style as needed. If your hair is slightly wet or damp, it will give you a wet look n be a little stiff. If your hair is completely dry, it will provide a semi-matte look. It&#x27;s kind of my go-to stuff. Work hard also has a very nice smell. Another reason why i keep buying it. I&#x27;m kind of a prefectionist with my hair so this kinda stuff matters to me. I&#x27;m always changing it up though, and try new products. But i reccommend this stuff very much! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Another review mentioned that this was  a Redken knockoff . I totally agree. I&#x27;ve used Redken Work Hard for  a few years now and can personally tell you this not Redken It smells different and does not look the same when applied. Plus my head itches after use. I will not purchase again nor recommend this seller it is a cheap knock off. Avoid&lt;br /&gt;Up-date I had a hair stylist look at the product I purchased. She said it had either been watered down or was expired. Lesson learned. Just because it is  a cheaper price doesn&#x27;t make it a good deal.</li>
    <li> finally a hair product that works as hard as I do</li>
    <li> Redken makes good products. I will continue to purchase it and use it.</li>
    <li> You can get any hair style with this paste and it removes easily with regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and love the way it makes my hair look.</li>
    <li> Expensive but good product. I have used this stuff for well over a year and will continue to do so.  Not too much hold but enough to make it throug the day</li>
    <li> Does the job really well on stubborn hair!</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product my husband will use and he&#x27;s been using it for years. No issues with seller or product and he&#x27;s looking pretty sexy, so no complaints :)</li>
    <li> As the title says....  This is my go to for non-greasy, medium hold product.  My hair is 2-3 inches long and this does the trick. Holds all day unless you keep touching your hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried several others molding wax and creams but this one seems to work different, it is not sticky and leaves a matte finish.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price.  You dont need to use too much and has strong hold without the wet look.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this product except for 2 things: The price and the amount of product I have to use.&lt;br /&gt;I found that I could find it cheaper at your local Supercuts at a cheaper price and they always have a buy one get one 50% off deal. Now, I use a lot  because I have a fair amount of hair, but I feel that I have to use a lot more than I think should be needed. Love the feel, smell, and how it holds my hair, but a bottle won&#x27;t last forever</li>
    <li> Does its job, but does have some setbacks. The price is a little high and it tends to dry out a little if you dont use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This company makes a couple of  good hair pastes, this is one of them.</li>
    <li> I have never found just perfect product. This stuff is not too sticky. it does not leave your hair too stiff.  And, it is not rough or hard to adjust</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product I use. I have thick hair and it&#x27;s been awesome. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly and in excellent condition.This item was exactly as described. My 16 year old bought it and is happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Using this product on a beard.  It does not seem strong enough which is the &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; of most preparations.  Was hoping, however....</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite some time, just couldn&#x27;t find it at the salon anymore. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, isn&#x27;t real heavy and just works great.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is all I use.  Great for stubborn hair!</li>
    <li> Have used this for a while.  Has good hold and doesn&#x27;t get a lot of build up or a greasy feel that some other products can.</li>
    <li> I have used your products for years, and prefer them to the products which are offered by the competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!</li>
    <li> Would have given it 5 stars, except it is overpriced.</li>
    <li> I love this gel. I&#x27;ve use it for years. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for thick hair</li>
    <li> Typically Redken products smell good, NOT this one.  It smells BAD!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and everyone who uses this loves it and buys more! It smells great like men&#x27;s cologne too. It won&#x27;t need to be washed out at the end of the day and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> This is the only product my husband will use. It&#x27;s the same price in the stores but the convenience of ordering it online and free delivery vs. lugging two munchkins in car seats out to a hair place to get it, makes in a no brainer. It styles nicely without crisp or oily hair. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Nice hold, reshapeable, but makes my hair stick straight up and in strands</li>
    <li> The cap for one of the bottles was missing</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo75KMLQTWILFP]]I have tried a lot of different products (Hair Stuff) Redkin is among my favorite. I am attaching a video comparing this and another Redkin product that is really very similar.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Pump: I like the pump because you can consistently get the same amount out each time for consistent results. (In the video it looks like the pump is difficult but its because Im trying to hold my phone/camera as well)&lt;br /&gt;+Smell: The smell is pleasant clean without being overpowering. I don&#x27;t smell it at all after applied.&lt;br /&gt;+Feel: This is a pro and a con. The feel isnt crispy or brittle and holds your hair in place without the gel head thing, but at the end of the day your hair will feel waxy which is inherent with this type of product I guess.&lt;br /&gt;+Look: The look holds your hair without being too firm. I would say it is pliable. It has a matte finish so you dont have an overly shiny appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Price: Someone mentioned price. While a little pricey the pump helps you to manage how much you use and it really doesnt take much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this product works well but I like a little more of a chunky style the other work hard product in the video works better for that. They both are very similar though this is just a little creamier going on. It is the consistency of sticky mayonnaise but not nearly as gross as that sounds.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and love it. The volume of product is pretty good for the price (lasts me about 1.5 months using every day). Depending on how wet your hair is when you apply the product, you can get a very slick looking hold or a very dry hold. Either way the product is very moldable and easy to work through hair. Have used multiple barbers over the last few years and all have recommended and used this product as well (I feel bad saying this but it&#x27;s a few bucks cheaper on Amazon vs. at the salon). The product does not leave a heavy residue so it&#x27;s also good for those worried about thinning or damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I was never a big paste guy... my hair care routine was to just use some spray on gel I buy at Target or Walgreens. But one day I was at Hair Cuttery getting a shampoo and cut and the stylist put the Redken Work Hard Molding Paste in my hair, along with a sales pitch that I should buy some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely buy products at a salon because it seems like they&#x27;re over priced, but I liked how this paste made my hair look so I bought some. At $14.99 it was a lot more than the $3.00 gel I usually buy, but I only needed about a dime size drop each day to get my short hair nice and styled, so the 3.4 oz bottle lasted me about 3 months! As it turns out, the price at Hair Cuttery ($14.99) is about the same as everywhere else, including Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that every few days I&#x27;d get ready to pump out my dime size drop of paste and there would be a hard, thick blob of dried paste hanging off the edge of the bottle. I&#x27;d wipe this off with a tissue so I could get out a smooth amount of paste, but I felt like I was wasting a lot of the product. Then recently I took a trip so I had to put the cap on the Redken bottle. I noticed at the hotel that I never got any dried paste build up on the nozzle of the bottle by replacing the cap after every use. When I returned home I continued to replace the cap on the bottle every day and again never had any more dried paste problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know replacing the cap probably sounds like a &amp;#34;duh&amp;#34; simple idea, but when I first bought the product I left the cap off since I didn&#x27;t see a reason to replace it. Now I do. The cap must keep out moisture or humidity or whatever it is that was drying the paste (I live in Florida). So if you start seeing dried paste, try keeping the cap on in between uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, if you&#x27;re a guy considering this paste I suggest you go to a Hair Cuttery or Supercuts or any salon that sells it and ask them to put some in after your cut. Then if you like it, you might as well buy it right there if its around $15.00. You might also want to ask the stylist to show you the best way to use the paste since there are some techniques that work better than others. That helped me a lot!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. I used american crew for many years. Its a nice change and updated look.</li>
    <li> tried to use today and it will NOT come out----did not save pkg. so cannot return. never order again</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. It will hold hair in place but feels like a bowl of greasy glue sitting on/in your hair. Weighs hair down and gives no movement to hair. Can&#x27;t wait to wash it out.... just a big yuk!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used endless amounts of hair gel/paste and this one is by far my favorite for my hair.  It was recommended to me by hair stylist and I have used it ever since.  It is a bit expensive but well worth it.  Make sure your hair is dry before using.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, honestly the best I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is sort of a pain in the butt and previous products would flake or lose their hold, this one does the opposite. It&#x27;s more expensive than other things but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product and I buy it time after time for that reason. It works great with my hair type and style</li>
    <li> Overall an excellent product, though not as firm as my overall favorite Redken Rough Paste 12. This works best when applied to dry hair only and often needs to be reshaped throughout the day as hair I like to push up over my forehead starts to fall down. No flaking though and a very convenient dispensing bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product because it&#x27;s not stiff but yet holds the hair in place and it allows you to reapply a different style to your hair throughout the day. It&#x27;s also easy to wash off with just water whereas I&#x27;ve had a hard time washing off other hair products even after shampooing.</li>
    <li> It smells great and works great</li>
    <li> I first used this at a upscale barber shop that I go to.  I love the stuff, it holds your hair but not too much.  It will not leave your hair crusty or shiny.</li>
    <li> The consistency is perfectly between a mouse and a fiber.  Great for thick hair if you are looking to add texture without the shine!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> So quick and easy to style my hair.  Quick dispense is just the right amount each time to give me the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
    <li> I like how it applies but the hold is very weak and by the end of the day my hair is completely flat even after pre hair drying for volume. Guys if ya got long hair don&#x27;t bother with it the hold is too weak</li>
    <li> my son loves this stuff for spiking his hair.  Not gluey or sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> My hubby is not a big hair product type of guy.  He uses a grocery store bought shampoo/conditioner in one, an after shave, and deodorant.  With the exception of this molding paste, that is it.  He has short very thick, wavy, hair that drives him crazy so he uses this paste (and this one only) on his hair.  He puts the paste on when his hair is wet, brushes it in place, and lets it dry naturally.</li>
    <li> I like the pump action of this molding paste. It is not exactly &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;it leaves a softer, dryer texture to the hair with the ability to change or reshape the hair at any time. I found with flat ironed hair this product tends to leave a white residue unless heated prior or after application ie flat iron or blow dryer. I have also mixed this with a flat iron hair protector and that works very well</li>
    <li> Lot&#x27;s of products to chose from out there...this es what it says it will do...BTW- I am a female and this is the best product to achieve that spikey look...I just hope that Redkin doesn&#x27;t put it from the product line...I&#x27;m prepared this time....plentuy of back up - just in case :)</li>
    <li> I love this so much.  Been using this for YEARS now and I&#x27;ve tried so many other products.  This one really does give you the right amount of hold, slight shine, and really long term stability.  Sometimes I wake up without washing my hair (I know, gross, but when you get home after 3am and you are super tired, are you seriously going to shower?), my hair looks perfect.  :D</li>
    <li> My favorite molding paste. Very sticky, so use sparingly. I use a half-dime size amount to tidy up my bangs. It serves the purpose for me really well, but I wouldn&#x27;t use the paste on my whole head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male with 1-6inch hair depending on the time of year.  Use this stuff every day for last 4 years.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I&#x27;ve been back and forth on gels and pomades for 10 years+... Best I&#x27;ve had! Perfect control with flexibility. No flaking or white residue (as long as you do a good job putting it in).</li>
    <li> Been a KMS molding paste user for years and wanted to see what else was out there.  Redken has a great brand name and it was about 5 bucks cheaper than KMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is a little more wet than KMS.  It&#x27;s also a little more greasy and harder to wash out with shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the right-guard deodorant smell to it - that alone is not going to make me repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is good tho - when dried it has a more crispier texture than KMS but and you can remold later too, it holds well for the whole day.  But again, it is hard to wash out, so be wary about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably going to go back to KMS.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product initially and then after couple of weeks it turned to liquid from paste. Was very disappointed in the end.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it just has a mind of its own with nothing in it - This isn&#x27;t sticky, washes off your hands easily and controls your hair all day without feeling too oily or going hard and dry.</li>
    <li> I think that the product I purchased, namely the one listed above, met my expectations and has been working great.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. It gives you a lot of maneuverability to form your hairstyle. My hair is really thin, so I always had a tough time with other products into getting my hair exactly the way I want it. This does the job. It gives you a great hold that last pretty much all day. A huge factor in this its that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all gooey and stuff, that way the ladies can feel your hair all day long with no complaints. My only gripe is that its pretty expensive. Other than that, its perfect and I can&#x27;t go out without this.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product to use to mold my hair. It&#x27;s a light paste and doesn&#x27;t make your hair rock hard, while still holding it in place. Also, it smells pretty good. ;)</li>
    <li> My hair looks a lot better with this molding paste.  Styles and holds it in place.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Good product just overpriced</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years. It&#x27;s good. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking wet or feeling oily.</li>
    <li> What can I say ... it holds my hair in place.  My hair is now in a beter place because of this product; bring it on wind, humidity, sleet and rain!</li>
    <li> My husband does not lke the paste.  It makes the hair stick together and does not look natural.  It has no shine so it tends to dull the hair.  A cream would proably work better.  Not for us.</li>
    <li> This product gives the perfect hold for medium-length hair to look natural but still be styled.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair look fake, more like it makes thin hair look a bit thicker.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well but the smell is so darn disgusting. The redken roughpaste 12 is better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it smell like? Find the most douchy bodyspray ie axe and spray it to a homeless person who hasn&#x27;t taken a shower in days. You get the scent don&#x27;t you? Ah I guess you&#x27;ll have to buy it to find out haha.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t too heavy and allows him to style his hair with his hands.  This is his 3rd bottle so based on that, I&#x27;m giving this five stars!</li>
    <li> Great for fine limp hair. Not greasy  and great for spiking hair. Much cheaper than other products but it works</li>
    <li> Me and my bros run this brand of wax every time we hit the clubs to meet the ladies.  The ladies love the spikey hair.</li>
    <li> Thought this product would give a firmer hold, instead it makes it maneuverable and a little greasy. Also I find the smell of this product to be really unpleasant.</li>
