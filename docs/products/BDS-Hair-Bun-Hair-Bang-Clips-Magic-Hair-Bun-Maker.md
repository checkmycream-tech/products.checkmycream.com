### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works perfectly!</li>
      <li>This bun maker is superb.</li>
      <li>The one is great, but I would not pay $10 for it.  </li>
      <li>Product is good, but it is pricey.</li>
      <li>and this was perfect for those quick buns to get the hair of the way when playing sports or chores.</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>This one holds my hair up (with hairsprays) into a cute doughnut bun!</li>
      <li>I have to have my hair up in a bun for work and this makes the task easy and is good for my hair (no breakage like you will get from using elastics).</li>
      <li>I could see how these would work nice if the quality was better.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s easy to make!</li>
      <li>I would love to have the option to pick the color..</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Large)/ Magic Hair Bun Maker&amp;#34; is referring to one product.</li>
      <li>I really love this product and will be buying it as stocking stuffers this Christmas for the ladies in my family.</li>
      <li>My hair is longer than most (to my waist)</li>
      <li>It makes cutesy puffy buns, but if you are doing any rigorous activity, the Hairagami works much better at holding your bun in place.</li>
      <li>The shipment came immediately and the color was purple which was okay with me...</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking to have a cute bun</li>
      <li>Women who have shoulder-length hair and want to twist it up quickly, this product is for you!</li>
      <li>Most likely a good product, but not for me.  </li>
      <li>The first part of the name (&amp;#34;Hair Bun Bang Clips&amp;#34;) is referring to the popular name for this type of product that is widely available in Asia.</li>
      <li>I would not have been happy with some of the other colors.</li>
      <li>Totally worth every $$$$.</li>
      <li>It take a few practice runs to get it right, but you will end up with a great bun that stays all day.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it did work good for my hair.</li>
      <li>The silky fabric covering slid right off no matter what I tried.</li>
      <li>The product is cool but, after a while it breaks from twisting to much.</li>
      <li>I love this product really good for me that i have thin hair...</li>
      <li>It takes a few tries to get it just right, but after that, it&#x27;s quick, easy, cute, and discrete!</li>
      <li>And the second part of the name (&amp;#34;Magic Hair Bun Maker&amp;#34;) is suppose to be a more direct descriptive name for the product.</li>
      <li>It does what it says, and the snap is secure enough that when I fell asleep with my hair in a bun, it stayed in place all night while I slept.</li>
      <li>All i need is one extra bobby pin to secure the hair in place that hides the snap.</li>
      <li>It is pretty thin, but I have a good amount of hair.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get this to make a decent bun that didn&#x27;t have gaps in it.</li>
      <li>I have ordered various hairbini to clip my long fine hair and none of them worked until now!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my slick long black hair!</li>
      <li>FYI: on the random color, I was happy to get a dark wine color because my hair is dark brown but wish you could choose your own color.</li>
      <li>Good if you have long thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I have medium thick hair and it works most times.  </li>
      <li>Kind of frustrating.</li>
      <li>A little bigger than I expected, but overall it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
      <li>Maybe my hair is just slippery in general?</li>
      <li>It is a really cool bun maker, but I found my hair is too thick for it.  </li>
      <li>I had intended to give these as a birthday gift, but one little headband doesn&#x27;t seem like much.  </li>
      <li>I have very long, thick hair that rarely stays in a bun, but this product works like a CHARM!</li>

    <li> I have very long, thick hair that rarely stays in a bun, but this product works like a CHARM! It takes a few tries to get it just right, but after that, it&#x27;s quick, easy, cute, and discrete! Love this product! I would recommend it to anyone looking to have a cute bun that&#x27;s easy to make!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girl,.wow it does wonders on her hair.... The product is cool but, after a while it breaks from twisting to much. Totally worth every $$$$.</li>
    <li> This bun maker is superb. I love it. It keeps my  hair up and neat. I have to have my hair up in a bun for work and this makes the task easy and is good for my hair (no breakage like you will get from using elastics). It has two snaps at both ends to keep the piece in place after you create the circle/donut. All i need is one extra bobby pin to secure the hair in place that hides the snap.</li>
    <li> They make it look as if you are getting a bunch of clips for $10, but you only get one!  What a ripoff!  The one is great, but I would not pay $10 for it.  They did not even give a choice of color.  I had intended to give these as a birthday gift, but one little headband doesn&#x27;t seem like much.  I would not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> It is a really cool bun maker, but I found my hair is too thick for it.  My hair is extraordinarily long and thick and I knew I was taking a chance.  Nevertheless, I will use it as a gift for someone.  Women who have shoulder-length hair and want to twist it up quickly, this product is for you!</li>
    <li> I have hair just below my shoulders and this did not work at all for me. I was mislead by the pictures thinking it would hold shorter hair. The silky fabric covering slid right off no matter what I tried. I gave it to my friend who has hip length hair. She loves it. By the way, it came in black, not a cute color! Beware!</li>
    <li> I have ordered various hairbini to clip my long fine hair and none of them worked until now! This one holds my hair up (with hairsprays) into a cute doughnut bun! It&#x27;s perfect for my slick long black hair! The shipment came immediately and the color was purple which was okay with me...</li>
    <li> In the pic it shows you all colors and I assumed you get all, but that is a mistake you get only one and not even your choice of colors.  I could have gotten 4 for the price of this one. Very misleading and very unhappy would not order from you again. Very cheaply made!</li>
    <li> Good if you have long thick hair.  I have medium thick hair and it works most times.  It can slip out sometimes.  After about two months the fabric was falling apart.  Not happy with that.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! I really love this product and will be buying it as stocking stuffers this Christmas for the ladies in my family.</li>
    <li> I have long sturdy hair and this was perfect for those quick buns to get the hair of the way when playing sports or chores. You will need a hair tie then use this product to put up your bun. Otherwise if you have long hair like me it&#x27;s going to become undone.</li>
    <li> I love this product really good for me that i have thin hair... I would love to have the option to pick the color..the presentation shows multiples colors, but they just sent me a black one..</li>
    <li> A little bigger than I expected, but overall it&#x27;s nice.  It does what it says, and the snap is secure enough that when I fell asleep with my hair in a bun, it stayed in place all night while I slept.</li>
    <li> Product is good, but it is pricey. I give it three stars only because It says about hair bang clips, but i did not get this product. Other than that, it did work good for my hair.</li>
    <li> It makes cutesy puffy buns, but if you are doing any rigorous activity, the Hairagami works much better at holding your bun in place.</li>
    <li> I could see how these would work nice if the quality was better. I had to mail mine back because the snap would absolutely not hold at all. FYI: on the random color, I was happy to get a dark wine color because my hair is dark brown but wish you could choose your own color. I would not have been happy with some of the other colors. I will leave 3 stars since I am considering giving them another try. Not sure yet...</li>
    <li> This is a nifty little invention! It take a few practice runs to get it right, but you will end up with a great bun that stays all day.</li>
    <li> Most likely a good product, but not for me.  My hair is longer than most (to my waist) so it could not hold it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say give it a shot it your hair is just past your shoulders.  I see the benefit of it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and have long (a few inches past my shoulders) hair. It is pretty thin, but I have a good amount of hair. Maybe my hair is just slippery in general? But the material that is on this product just slipped out of my hair every time. It also arrived damaged, so I&#x27;m returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, &amp;#34;Hair Bun Hair Bang Clips (Large)/ Magic Hair Bun Maker&amp;#34; is referring to one product. The first part of the name (&amp;#34;Hair Bun Bang Clips&amp;#34;) is referring to the popular name for this type of product that is widely available in Asia. It should say &amp;#34;Clip&amp;#34; (singular, not plural), but that&#x27;s a common mistake made by people who learn English as a second language. And the second part of the name (&amp;#34;Magic Hair Bun Maker&amp;#34;) is suppose to be a more direct descriptive name for the product.</li>
    <li> I have medium-long, thick hair. I couldn&#x27;t get this to make a decent bun that didn&#x27;t have gaps in it.</li>
    <li> took longer to receive then expected. Not much product for the price. I received the pink one although i did not specify a color because there wasn&#x27;t a place to, i thought i would get the array of colors for that price.  didn&#x27;t work well at all on my thick hair. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in my yoga classes. My hair is stick straight and down to my butt, but with long layers so parts of my hair start sticking out when I try to roll the clip. Kind of frustrating. After a few tries and tired shoulders, I usually manage a decent bun.</li>
