<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They mailed me the wrong item in the correct box. I got all excited when I saw it and then I opened it up and inside was Palmer&#x27;s  Skin Therapy Oil. I saw Palmer&#x27;s had amazing reviews but it did nothing for me. I then went and bought the glow renewal at a store and I do like it. Be careful putting it near the eyes. It makes my eyes run like crazy if I put it closer than an inch because of all the fragrances and it burns.</li>
    <li> A complete hydration without the feeling of oiliness. I wake up with a refresh silky face.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My skin feels silky, not oily, and I definitely see a &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34;  I use it every morning - alone or under makeup.  It&#x27;s a perfect base!  The little bottle lasts a good while, cause you only need a little bit to &amp;#34;shine.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It keeps my skin hydrated and feeling so smooth</li>
    <li> much too greasy to use on the face. I will use it to prevent hangnails in the winter.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and It is excellent for my skin.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing effect is very good</li>
    <li> It smells fresh and goes on so smooth. It is oil but does leave you feeling oily just smooth and clean!!</li>
    <li> Got compliments after using it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for 2 days now &amp; I know it&#x27;s not a long time but so far so good. I have very sensitive skin &amp; my face isn&#x27;t breaking out or getting red. I also really like the light smell it has, I have been using at night &amp; day time.</li>
    <li> Love this!!!  Works great.</li>
    <li> This oil has a really soft feel.  I love the texture.  It softens the appearance of your skin.  I should probably use it more than once a day as it absorbs.  I use it around the eyes.  Try not to rub your eye then as you will think you are getting some dread condition but, no, you have accidentally oiled your eyeball.  One bottle lasts quite a while if you are using it in small areas of your face.</li>
    <li> I love face oil, and have tried the expensive ones.  In my opinion oil is oil, and this works great and I love the scent.  It does not clog my pores at all, and my face looks and feels nourished when I wake up.  It could be a bit more natural but what do you expect from a mass produced product?  For all natural, expect to pay 10x as much for 1/4 of the product because it goes rancid so quickly.  I love this stuff would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I only just received this so I don&#x27;t know what the long term benefits will be but so far I love it. My skin soaks this up and I can practically hear it saying &amp;#34;oh my gosh, thank you!!!&amp;#34;. It feels great. I read other reviews that talked about the scent. It does have a very light scent, refreshing I would say. My skin has gotten very dry as I have aged and I now have skin issues that I never had in my teen years. This morning I woke up and noticed that my skin was not flaky and I swear some of the redness in my cheeks was gone. Wishful thinking? I don&#x27;t know. But I&#x27;m going to use every last drop of this!</li>
    <li> They switched prices on me. Don&#x27;t like the stuff either.</li>
    <li> Age: 56&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rosacea, combination skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glow facial oil is amazing - I am so glad I purchased it. I was worried at first that it would make my face feel oily, especially since though I am in my 50s my skin can still tend to feel oily in the Tzone and have breakouts if I am not careful with products, but instead my skin soaks it up. A little goes a long way - place a few drops in your palm, then dot a little here and there around your face; massage with fingertips until your skin absorbs the oil. The aroma is relaxing and wonderful so that I really love using it at night before bed - I notice lavender and rosemary most of all. My face feels soft and looks \\&quot;plumped\\&quot; and moist, but without the oily slick slippery feeling I have found with some oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even use some of the oil on my lips - it will soak right in and if you don&#x27;t like the \\&quot;taste\\&quot; just put a little lip balm on top of it after you&#x27;ve rubbed in in the oil. Also, I will massage some into my throat and chest. This bottle will last a long time - there&#x27;s more in it than I thought there&#x27;d be, and you don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it morning and night almost every day and have had no breakouts or irritation, even with my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again, although I have to say I bought it for less somewhere else - hoping Amazon will at least match that price later on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past few weeks and have loved it! I usually mix about 1-2 drops with my moisturizer twice a day and also mix a few drops into my body lotion. It smells really good and hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is softer and helps stave off the winter dryness.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that is has slightly reduced the appearance of stretch marks, but that could just be me.</li>
    <li> It really makes a glow.  As inexpensive as it is, do yourself a favor, and try it.  I LOVE it, and I&#x27;ve tried many in my 67 years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 and the stuff makes me break out. I haven&#x27;t had zits since I was in my 20s. You have to use a minuscule amount or look greasy. Haven&#x27;t really used it since I bought it. But each time I have – maybe five times – I get a zit somewhere.</li>
    <li> The main ingredients in this  that are healthy for your skin are regular oils - olive oil, coconut oil (specific fractioned off molecules of it), jojoba oil,  sunflower seed oil, even CORN OIL!.there is fragrance listed in the ingredients so I&#x27;m guessing that most of the nice smell is from that...I think it&#x27;s a nice moisturizing oil and smells divine...a natural lavender herbal type of smell...anyway I&#x27;d much rather make this at home buying the oils listed in the ingredients and adding some essential oils to make it smell nice....then it would be without any artificial fragrance, and there would be a WHOLE LOT more of it for cheaper. I&#x27;ve used oil before as moisturizer on my face and it works really well...it&#x27;s as nice as this. Buy some olive oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil and almond oil...mix it up equally into an oz then add a few drops of lavender and rosemary essential oil and you will have a better product than this that you can make in small batches at a time for much cheaper per ounce.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let face oil scare you off. Even if you have oily skin oils can be great for moisturizing and even cleansing. I have combination skin and I apply this all over my face at least once and sometimes twice a day. My skin is much softer and not only do I not have more breakouts my skin is clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few drops will cover your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil absorbs much more quickly than other moisturizers - so quickly that I can apply makeup right after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell? Love it. I hate anything that smells artificial or too flowery. To me this smells very natural-slightly flowery but more what I can only describe as a plant-like scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed that this makes my face glow but it is a her nice moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell and feel of this product, (tester in shop) but after I bought it, found that it makes my skin very itchy, and in fact I broke out in a rash on the face and neck. it also smells strong and almost feel like using it in an oil burner! what recourse do I have to return this product Loreal?? should I be diluting it??</li>
    <li> The feel of this product is great and it is really helping in the dry months however I agree with other reviewers that the smell is awful.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again simply because of the smell.  I was hoping this would be an equivalent to the Josie Maran oil but because of the smell it doesn&#x27;t come close.</li>
    <li> I used several bottles of this stuff and loved it, my dry skin really drank it up. For some reason, it suddenly started making me break out in an itchy rash on the side of my face. I stopped using it several times until the rash cleared up, but unfortunately it breaks me out every time I use it now. I don&#x27;t know if L&#x27;Oreal changed the formula. Weird that I was able to use several bottles of it with great results and now it causes such a bad rash:(</li>
    <li> For dry skin, this is great. I highly doubt it is effective as a cell &amp;#34;renewal&amp;#34; product but it really helps with retaining moisture. It works well. However, the smell is disgusting. I am not sensitive to smells at all, I love perfume and incense and all kinds of smelly stuff so take this from someone who is not scent adverse. This smells exactly like Murphy&#x27;s Wood soap oil that I use to mop my floor, exactly like it. When I put it on my face I think of mopping floors. ew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the ingredients they use lemolene, this is a fake lemon smelling fragrance and it is very much overused in this case. If you like Murphy&#x27;s, and want to slather that scent on your face, go to! Otherwise, give it a pass.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes, but turned off by the fragrance. Goes on easily and works as advertised, but the fragrance is way too strong for this kind of product. If it came unscented, this would definitely be a 4-5 star product, so if you&#x27;re not put off by the scent, you might want to give it a try.</li>
    <li> My skin was getting extremely dried. After a few days of using this product my skin is soft and it has a glow to it.</li>
    <li> CAUSED BREAKOUTS!! Never ever have i used a product that caused breakouts like this.  Good lord, I RARELY get acne, i mean sure a few bumps on the chin before my period. i started using this stuff and i kept breaking out in tiny little zits on my CHEEKS, TEMPLES, and chin! Wow this product is s***. which sucks because it feels very nice going on. what a shame.</li>
    <li> loved it.  it is amazing on my face.  my face is constantly dry and this works wonderfully.  i put it on before bed and wake with a freash face.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea which makes my skin very sensitive. It is very frustrating trying to find facial products that do not irritate or flare up my skin condition. I had very high hopes for this product based on the reviews, but alas it irritates my face mildly.  It smells quite lovely which is a bonus since most face lotions do not, it goes on light, and the oiliness goes away quickly leaving a dewy glow.  I continue to use the product regularly on my neck and chest, and it has made my skin noticeably softer and smoother in those areas.</li>
    <li> Has taken years off my face. Smells great and has made my face soft and smooth. Decreased wrinkles noticeably.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product came to my attention via a sample in O magazine. That sample had me wanting more...but allas not for sale in Europe. Via amazon then....and it lives up to ny expectations. My skin is calm and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Leaves your face so soft and does glow.  Is not greasy at all soaks right in your face and feels like you have a ton of moisture in your face.  When they say you only need 4 drops for your face that is all you need.  Good price</li>
    <li> I need to use it more often and haven&#x27;t so I really don&#x27;t have a definite great or not answer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this facial oil at a local big-box store. After washing my face that evening, I eagerly opened the box to try this oil. The smell....how can I describe it? It is very strong, very &#x27;perfume-y&#x27;, very over-powering. I kept the oil on in hopes of the smell fading - which it did by the next morning. I used it for several more days (morning and evening), and eventually became used to the smell - but it still stunk. It smells like really cheap old-lady perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you can get past the awful smell, the oil itself is excellent. I have very sensitive skin with mild rosacea, and this oil actually eliminated the redness I usually experience after washing my face. It is smooth and silky, and has a light texture that sinks in after application. Apply this to skin that has been dried off after cleansing. I put 5 drops of the oil into my palm and then lightly tap it into my skin using the other hand. Then I apply my regular moisturizer (Cera Ve PM Moisturizer) over the oil. It has made my skin very smooth and hydrated, with no irritation, and no break-outs. The oil is amazing, the smell is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will look great, but you will smell bad. Too bad L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t read the reviews to see the complaints about the bad odor.</li>
    <li> Rundown: I&#x27;m 28 years old (and a major product junkie), and thought to myself, \\&quot;Hmm, maybe I should upgrade my beauty products?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I chose this oil as it does an excellent job at hydrating my skin! I have oily skin and naturally I was very hesitant about using this product, but I&#x27;m glad I took the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: It&#x27;s made of a unique blend of 8 essential oils (that includes English Lavender, Rosemary Leaf, Geranium, Orange Peel, Roman Chamomile, Rose Flower, Lavandin, and Marjoram Leaf) selected for their ability to replenish skin and restore a healthy looking glow to even dry, dull skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue/Result: I&#x27;m Black and have hyperpigmentation resulting from acne scars. I used this oil twice daily for two weeks and my skin literally glows and has a silky, smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this though: a little goes a long way. This oil is very concentrated and two drops cover the entirety of my face.</li>
    <li> Great product that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of. I use 4 or 5 drops at night around my eyes, nose and under my chin. Don&#x27;t use to much or it will be an oily mess.</li>
    <li> I used to use a much higher-priced serum, but this is so much better for my very dry skin, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than the product I was using. After showering, I rub a few drops into the skin of my face and neck. Within minutes it soaks in, to leave my skin looking younger and fresher. And I love the eyedropper, so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about contaminating the product. At $17.99 on Amazon, it&#x27;s cheaper than the $24.00 that it sells for at my local grocery and pharmacy. I highly recommend to anyone with dry, aging skin.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to all the face creams and they all have propyl glycol and other toxins.  This smells wonderful and is light and it works.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the recommendation of a friend. I will never really know if it works since the smell is so horrible, I can&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s overpowering, doesn&#x27;t go away and, because it&#x27;s on your face, not usable as a result. I can&#x27;t even quite describe what the smell is--it&#x27;s perfumey and cloying, not herbal. Why a company would put such a strong scent in a face product is beyond me. Do yourself a favor, don&#x27;t buy. I made the mistake and now have to pay shipping to send it back--totally wasted money.</li>
    <li> After washing my face, I&#x27;ll put about five drops of the L&#x27;Oreal Facial Oil on my face and gently massage it into my skin.  I love the softness of my skin afterwards and the fragrance of the oil.  I frequently also put it on my neck and decolletage at nighttime.  The oil is not greasy, just light and soothing.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week so I can&#x27;t comment about long term quality. And face it, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m starting to see a more smoother result as my skin is very dry especially in the winter. So far, So good...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice face oil and found the one I&#x27;m sticking with in this product. It&#x27;s not pricey, doesn&#x27;t smell overpowering and makes my aging skin feel and look glowing.</li>
    <li> This is a really lovely product at a very reasonable price..it is quickly absorbed and has a slight pleasant smell and is not overly scented. It makes one&#x27;s skin feel soft and smooth. I use it under my day cream and am using less day cream since using the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it while studying in the States last year and my daughter commented on how my skin was looking so much better hydrated and asked what I was using. I am in my mid-fifties and my skin had been looking dry. I have now bought further bottles from Amazon as it is not available in my country. One bottle lasts around 4 to 5  months.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time with a coupon since I had heard such good things about it.  I have extremely oily skin (I&#x27;m usually using blotting papers well before lunchtime) but I&#x27;ve also noticed some fine lines showing up and in the wintertime my skin gets dry patches.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this oil I thought the smell was a little overpowering, but that does go away after a few minutes so I didn&#x27;t deduct any stars for it.  Then I noticed how nice my skin felt and decided I didn&#x27;t need to use a moisturizer over my usual acne cream.  WOW what a difference!  I put oil on my face....and after a few hours I don&#x27;t really have much oil on my face.  Apparently my dermatologist from my teenage years (I&#x27;m now racing towards 40) was right when he said oily skin will just make more oil if you strip too much oil away from it.  It seems that by adding oil instead my skin has calmed down quite a bit (I wish he&#x27;d have told me to ADD oil!).  My skin is definitely softer, my acne has improved, and the lines are softened a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a miracle product that&#x27;s going to make all of your lines go away but it does make the skin feel great and look healthier.  And like I said, for me it has actually made my skin less greasy, though to this day I still am not sure how that works.  I have also noticed that as I age the pores on my cheeks which are large from having oily skin, were starting to have this orange-peel look to them, even from a distance (say sitting across the table from someone distance, not from across the room).  The orange peel texture has definitely improved, although the pores are still big.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is because my skin is less greasy (it&#x27;s definitely more noticeable when my skin is shiny) or if this product has actually tightened up the sagging pores enough that the texture is less rough.  It definitely feels smoother, anyway.  Some people may be put off by the smell, but unless you are allergic or extremely sensitive to odors or one of the ingredients, it would be worthwhile to get a sample if you can and try wearing it for a few days to see if you don&#x27;t get over the odor because it does fade a lot in a few minutes.  I&#x27;ve asked some family members to sniff me to make sure I wasn&#x27;t just getting used to the smell and after half an hour none of them can smell this stuff on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is that you should still use a sunscreen with this product as it doesn&#x27;t give any protection from the sun.ou are allergic or extremely sensitive to odors or one of the ingredients, it would be worthwhile to get a sample if you can and try wearing it for a few days to see if you don&#x27;t get over the odor because it does fade a lot in a few minutes.

    <li> Great item! I use this for multiple things.</li>
    <li> my skin drinks this in! And I really like the smell - kind of rosemary-ish. Not a delicate floral by any means, but pretty. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> never order from amazon again.  i am very much disappointed with amzon. they even didnt ship the item i paid.  i got a men&#x27;s moisture (lessthan$10) instead of loreal paris age perfecr glow($17).  also they shipped the wrong type of loreal hydra renewal moisture which i ordered together. i can returen because the items were brought to china by friends.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product.  It really does give your face a lot of moisture and it does diminish the look of fine lines.  I really like it conjunction with the Age Perfect Renewal Day/Night Cream.</li>
    <li> At 47 years old, I was completely unprepared to the extent that your hair and skin dries out after menopause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different lotions for the past, spending far too much money on both high-end products and drugstore brands, but none have moisturized the way I wanted or needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect. All I can say is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you L&#x27;Oreal and I sincerely hope you never stop making this oil. It&#x27;s super light and unscented, yet the moisturizing is unsurpassed. I use this oil approximately one hour after using a retinol (ROC deep wrinkle serum is fantastic, use for 12 weeks before expecting results), in the AM and PM every day. I put a drop or two each on forehead, chin, cheeks and neck and rub it in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels like I am 20 years old again. Amazing. Awesome. Fantastical. I can&#x27;t even express how much I love touching  my face and it once again feels soft, smooth (don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate daily) and fresh. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, so pleased with this product, Try it and you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> my skin drinks this fountain of youth. i LOVE it and it does NOT make me break out! i mix about 5 drops with a vitamin E cream to absorb into my skin. i use it in the morning and at night, and after i shower. I have very dry skin and this is the only product that i&#x27;ve found to be of any benefit. (absorbs, moisturizes, no breakouts or over greasiness)  it does have a strong smell, but i like it- it&#x27;s a clean, fresh smell.</li>
    <li> Have not used long enough to see long time results, but not greasy on the face, absorbs well and hopeful for longtime results.</li>
    <li> This product does not disappoint.  Highly rated item for aging skin that needs youthful &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; restored.  Long-lasting and easy to apply.  Wonderful to combat the effects of cold winter weather or drying climates.</li>
    <li> I love this product. That being said, if you have oily skin this product is not for you. My a kin is very dry and soaks up the oil quickly. I love the way it makes my skin feel soft and silky and gives it a glow. Make sure to rub into your skin for a minute or so to avoid missing spots where oil could build up.</li>
    <li> Excited to use this as I had read great reviews. Used it for about a week and couldn&#x27;t deal with the smell. Reminded me of citronella bug spray which I cannot stand the smell of. I know you&#x27;re supposed to use a product for at least thirty days to see results. Sadly I was unable to do that. In the week I used it, I found that it would sink in nicely to my skin and appeared to give my skin somewhat of a dewy glow. Not enough that I could continue to use it. If I could tolerate the smell I would be able to see if it actually lives up to its claims. Sadly I cannot.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had enough time to evaluate results.</li>
    <li> I am presently using my second bottle of this wonderful oil under the night cream. The results are so soothing in cold weather. Not sure at this time if the oil will be too heavy for summer.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly impressed with this oil. It is not strong smelling AT ALL, and it goes on very light. I already see a difference in my appearance after only 5 or 6 applications. I am just 55, and I have normal skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel like you have oil on your face at all. After you massage it in, it doesn&#x27;t feel as though you have anything on your skin at all. And like one reviewer said earlier, this bottle will last a very long time. It has a lot more in it than I thought it would. I highly recommend LÓreal Glow Renewal oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this once a day. It is making some what of a difference. The key to any product is to use it until you see a difference. Give it a chance to work. Feels good on your skin. I have oily skin and was afraid it would make it more oily but it did not.</li>
    <li> I discovered this oil on a whim, at the drugstore.  It is cheaper on Amazon.  It lightly moisturizes (even though it&#x27;s an oil), absorbs completely and it&#x27;s smell is sophisticated and delicate.  I tried &amp;#34;another&amp;#34; brand and was sorely disappointed and went back to this one.  I sure hope L&#x27;Oreal keeps making it!</li>
    <li> I wear bangs and have found other similar products leaving my hair oily. This oil does not.  My skin drinks in this Glow Renewal Facial Oil and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.  It also makes my skin feel so soft and supple, and full of moisture. This effect lasts all day.  It only takes a few drops morning and night, so it&#x27;s a great buy for the money.  I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a facial oil so I was a bit skeptical, but was delightfully surprised. The oil is very light and absorbs into the skin easily, but still leaves a trace of a nice shiny glow. the fragrance is very light and pleasant. Only a few drops from the dropper are necessary, so the bottle has been lasting a long time. Would highly recommend. Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> used before the cream, it soaked into skin and prepared a base for the cream - wonderful-highly recommend it for dry skin</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and nothing has ever worked, not even prescriptions.  This oil is amazing!  My skin feels so soft after I use this and stays that way for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this.  It is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Buttery rich velvety soft feel this facial oil is the best product for anyone especially a person who has dry skin or wants a healthy glow after being in the sun all day and wants to keep their tan longer I will use this all summer long under my favorite moisturizer even though I purchased this in the dark of winter L&amp;#34;Oreal couldn&#x27;t have made a better product for me and for anyone who wants to glow!</li>
    <li> This facial oil gives to my face a nice glow. It is so light , and it has a nice smell. i just like the way my skin looks after I use it on my face.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot, smells good, feels good--one caveat--keep it away from your eyes, it migrates easily and while it doesn&#x27;t sting, it kinda blurs your vision for a while and is kinda annoying. I would just suggest going very light when getting close to your eyes--I may have just put too much on in this area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for less than a week and already I can see a difference in my skin, especially in the neck area. To me, it smells kind of herbal. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s offensive, but I&#x27;d rather it had no scent. I&#x27;m still absolutely thrilled with this product.</li>
    <li> New product for dry skin.  I like it, but found nothing special about this oil for skin.  A less expensive moisturizer would have worked just as well.</li>
    <li> Not only does it make my skin feel good, it&#x27;s pleasantly aromatic. I put it on every night and under my regular moisterizer during the day. Love it and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It deeply nourishes and replenishes dull, dry skin. it is non-greasy and absorbs quickly for all-day hydration. Just 4 drops is enough. It removes discoloration and leaves a beautiful and soft skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used this product yet -- I have very sensitive skin with a tendency to break-out -- so I&#x27;m holding off using this product until we get into full-blown winter.</li>
    <li> I found it is not a renewal oil,, nor does it give you a glow.  I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> great oil for for skin-much less expensive than many other similar products and works just as well</li>
    <li> It gives you a healthy glow especially if your face is dry. I use this at night along with a moisturizer. I will reorder again and would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Start with this Glow Renewal Facial Oil, add some primer and as last step a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;This combination makes a perfect make up result</li>
    <li> I have ordered this three times, and absolutely love this product.  Rest assured, I will continue to use this oil.</li>
    <li> the smell is very overpowering but I don&#x27;t mind as I like good smelling products..it&#x27;s not greasy and a little goes a long way. It makes my skin glow and makes it feel so soft in the morning. My night routine: cleanse face, use toner, put on Serum, wait a few mins to let the serum sink in, then put on a few drops of the oil and done! Highly recommend this (if you are not sensitive to fragrant face products)</li>
    <li> At first it feels greasy going on but then your skin absorbs it very quickly. Like most anti-age fluid&#x27;s, I&#x27;m not 100% positive that it works, but my skin does feel more smooth and less dehydrated.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. It is very greasy and I can&#x27;t see where it is any better than baby oil which is a lot less expensive.</li>
    <li> I had been using Bio Oil to add extra moisture to my face.  I received a sample of L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Glow Renewal facial oil and fell in love with it!!!  It is by far the superior of the two products.  I use it in the morning before putting on sunscreen.  It not only smells heavenly (it is loaded with delicously scented essential oils) but it goes on easily and makes the face feel smooth, plumped, glowing, hydrated and not at all greasy.  What a wonderful product.  It is worth every penny (and it doesn&#x27;t cost many). You will not be sorry if you purchase this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:  I have now been using this product for three months and everything I reported above is so absolutely true.  I only use it in the morning and have only used 1/3 of the bottle.  A super product at a very reasonable price~~</li>
    <li> I was quite excited when this first showed up as a sample in Oprah magazine last month and tried it immediately. It felt like silk on my skin, and left me with a light glow, much like the name implies. I purchased it at Walgreens with a $5 coupon, so it cost me $20. The first thing I noticed is that it is packaged very nicely in a glass bottle with a dropper, which keeps it very sanitary. The oil is light gold in color, and I do wish that the bottle was tinted to preserve the oil, rather than in a clear bottle where light can get to it. There is a light fragrance, but it smells vaguely of flowers/roses, which I think could be from the rose oil. Olive oil is the second ingredient, but strangely, it is not touted as one of the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; oils in this, which are English Lavender, Rosemary Leaf, Geranium, Orange Peel, Roman Chamomile, Rose Flower, Lavandin, and Marjoram Leaf. There is also jojoba seed oil - again not mentioned except in the ingredient list. The first ingredient, caprylic/capric triglyceride, is another name for coconut oil. It should be noted that this does contain fragrance and benzyl alchohol (although it is listed towards the bottom of the ingredient list). On to the feel - this oil is very light, and absorbs quickly. That said, I don&#x27;t find it incredibly moisturizing. It does impart a glow to the skin, but not in the sense of an oily sheen - just a light dewiness to the appearance of skin. If you have dry skin, you will most likely want to follow up with a moisturizer. I have been mixing this in with my day cream, and at night, I combine with my beautifying serum by Euphora, which provides additional moisture. You get a lot of product, and I think that with using 10-12 drops daily, this would last a year. Overall, I like this oil a lot, find it to be far less oily than other products, and also find it to be a nice alternative to other face oils I have used such as Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil. That said, if you are a devotee of Josie, you might not like this due to a. the artificial fragrance 2. the presence of alcohol, and 3. the lightness of the oil that seeks to impart a glow to skin rather than provide a lot of moisture.t like this due to a. the artificial fragrance 2. the presence of alcohol, and 3. the lightness of the oil that seeks to impart a glow to skin rather than provide a lot of moisture.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most amazing facial oil ever.  It absorbs immediately and there is no oily residue or feeling left on the skin.  It also smells great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of L&#x27;Oreal products, and use them along with pricier department-store, Sephora, and other skincare lines&#x27; items.  I was happy with the Age Perfect Glow Renewal day cream, so, I thought I&#x27;d give this oil a try, to use after my Kinerase serum and before the Age Perfect cream.  It&#x27;s awful.  This stuff isn&#x27;t just oily, it&#x27;s greasy; it will, if you don&#x27;t use it very carefully, end up all over everything--your hairline, hands, clothes, counter-top.  Secondly, the oil is delivered through an eye-dropper, so you&#x27;d best be careful not to knock the bottle over when you&#x27;re applying the oil (what, they couldn&#x27;t have put the liquid into a different type of bottle that didn&#x27;t require a dropper?).  And thirdly, if you have any kind of bad reaction to rosemary, as do I, avoid this stuff like Ebola!  It REEKS of rosemary.  Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if L&#x27;Oreal bothered to mention that on the front of the packaging instead of in the wee print on the back?  I used this stuff exactly once.  As soon as I&#x27;d finished rubbing it into my skin I was clobbered by the overpowering scent of rosemary, and had to wash it off my face and hands immediately.</li>
    <li> I love the glow it gives and I love the fragrance. The fragrance is very soothing..  I Don&#x27;t know what else to say.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited until I used a full bottle of this oil before reviewing.  The test is always whether or not I&#x27;ll buy another...and I did!  This stuff is amazing because after trying what felt like every moisturizing product on the market, this oil solved my flaky skin issues. I had previously been using Bio Oil, but it didn&#x27;t quite do the job.  This L&#x27;Oreal oil is wonderful.  I use about 6 drops in the morning after washing and before my other moisturizers, and 6 drops at night.  One bottle used at this rate lasted 2-1/2 months.  I want to emphasize that once this oil has been applied, the skin is wonderfully soft and not in the least bit greasy or oily.  The only caveat might be if you have very oily skin you would  not want or need this particular product.  But for dry skin, and for &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin it is a wonder!  I&#x27;m surprised people would complain about the scent...I&#x27;m very sensitive to odd cosmetic odors, but found this oil very pleasant and not at all strong.  Once the oil is applied, the scent disappears anyway, so it&#x27;s hardly an issue.  I put the 6 drops into my palm and then with my other fingertips dot it around my face and then gently massage it in.  It soaks in very quickly and you do not look or feel oily.  A few moments later, I apply whatever moisturizer cream or lotion I&#x27;m using that day...I switch things around and try a lot of things for further protection and SPF coverage.  In just a few days my flakiness pretty much disappeared and has remained gone ever since.  My 64 year old skin really needed just what this oil offers and I&#x27;m so happy it solved my long-time problem with spotty dryness and flakiness.  I&#x27;ll add that I&#x27;ve tried some of the very costly oil type serums from Lancome, Lauder and others, and while they were nice enough, they did NOT work nearly as well as this oil and they did not solve my issues.  The price seems to be coming down quite fast...my first bottle was 24, my second one I found at 19, and now I see Amazon has an even lower and very good price on it.  I have very sensitive skin with mild occasional rosacea, and this oil does not irritate in the least.  I can say without reservation I consider it my #1 skin product and the one I simply cannot do without, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever felt that way about a product before.  It&#x27;s a real bonus that this is a L&#x27;Oreal product you can buy just about anywhere and it&#x27;s very affordable, unlike the fancy department store brands (where I paid 60+ for half the amount of what I considered a much less effective product for my needs).  I hope L&#x27;Oreal doesn&#x27;t ever stop making this product because I really depend on it now!  I can say I&#x27;m 100% pleased with it, and that&#x27;s not something I say very much about cosmetic products.  Update 1/14/14:  Still love this oil, just opened my 3rd bottle.  I&#x27;ve been tracking, and at the use of about 14 drops per day (7 morning, 7 evening) a bottle lasts me 2 months.  This has become my &amp;#34;can&#x27;t be without&amp;#34; skin product.  The current Amazon price is the lowest I&#x27;ve seen anywhere, by the way.  Update 7/5/15:  Stilling loving it, and in general I use it every morning as the first product I use, and almost every evening before bed (then I put a night cream on top of it).  This is probably the mostly continuously I&#x27;ve used any facial product, it&#x27;s really a &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; for me now.  There are other similar products out there, even in the drugstore lines, but most of them cost far more for the same or even lesser amounts and I doubt they are any better so I don&#x27;t even both buying them.  It would be crazy to buy one of those elite oils….I had one from Lauder that I paid $50+ for before I tried this oil, and honestly, it just wasn&#x27;t nearly as good and it didn&#x27;t do anything miraculous. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s oil provides better moisturizing and because of the affordable price, I use more of it than I could bring myself to use of the Lauder product.  For my needs, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s performs much better anyway.  Amazon&#x27;s current price is definitely the best I&#x27;ve seen anywhere else, especially if you have Prime.  Update 12/24/16 - Still using this oil, still love it.  My skin really needs oil as I am over 60, and this is what I use first, with regular moisturizer or sunscreen on top of it.  It really does sink in quickly and your skin does not look oily at all.  This product has definitely ended my dry, flaky skin problem.  I&#x27;m wondering if L&#x27;Oreal is going to phase it out because I don&#x27;t see it in the stores any more, and now there is a similar product with 30 spf sunscreen in it.  I tried that one, but didn&#x27;t like it as well.  Still a great buy on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel not greasy but smooth.</li>
    <li> received in good shape</li>
    <li> I bought this from reading the good reviews, and I&#x27;ve purchased it again. I do like the way it feels and also gives my skin a dewy, but not oily look and at my age dewy is a good thing. My first review was not as positive but I do look forward to applying those drops morning and evening. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it made me look younger, LOL.</li>
    <li> mostly because the item was shipped to me opened , without a box , unsealed ,in a ziplock bag even though it was described as new.... i did not use it , but smelt it and it smelt strange......so don&#x27;t know if this is how it should be, but am returning it</li>
    <li> My hair is hydrated &amp; shiny.</li>
    <li> wow! This is something I use day and night with my day or night cream.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started to use it I have noticed a big difference in my skin.  The best part is that it dries so nicely whitout leaving that greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the concept that putting oil on your face is a good thing but I&#x27;m understanding more and I love it. I love this product. I put ~4-5 drops on morning and night and whenever I feel like it if I&#x27;m around the house with nothing to do. This Chicago winter was brutal on my skin and no one facial moisturizer did the trick. Even moisturizers designed for very dry skin.  I put this on, let it absorb and then put my facial lotion on. It&#x27;s the best combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an ingredient standpoint, I don&#x27;t love that there&#x27;s things I can&#x27;t pronounce on the ingredient list, but until I feel like doing more research on facial oils, I&#x27;ll stick with this.  The price is actually better than many other facial oils and this stuff will last you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff also SMELLS so good.  Kind of earthy in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it did not make me break out at all! If anything my occasional breakouts have diminished.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this oil, I love the smell, I love how it goes on the skin and I love how it moisturizes the skin. Like an other reviewer I used Bio Oil for a while but did not like that, it doesn&#x27;t smell very good and it is just too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;This is to me the best face oil on the market.</li>
    <li> It seems to refresh the skin, absorbing quickly, producing a smoother look and feel.  I like the fact that it is made of natural herbal oils.  But the fragrance smells like perfume, not strong and overpowering but still a little cloying and unpleasant.  It dissipates after half an hour, or so; however, it would be much better if it retained the fragrance of one of its herbal ingredients, like a subtle lavender, rather than a hodge-podge of unidentifiable smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added a year later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you use all of this in just a few months, the oil will turn rancid . . .  which makes me wonder what it&#x27;s chief ingrediant actually is.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOD.</li>
    <li> I thought that I would love this as I am older (56) and wanted to brighten my complexion.  I tried it for a little over a month in the spring.  It seemed to make my face rougher and scaly.  So I stopped and recently tried it again.  After three days, I am beginning to see the same roughness and scaliness to my skin. I do not know why this is happening. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 30 and this makes me smell like and old lady.I will not be getting this again, even if it does work. they should make this fragrance free. In contrast, I&#x27;ve been using MURAD which is $65.00 a bottle and I can tell a HUGE difference... the MURAD is more rich and less watery- goes on and I feel instantly wayyyy more soft than with the glow serum. I&#x27;m new to serums- you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I think this product is boosting the healthy look of my skin but I need to give it a little more time.</li>
    <li> Got this product a few days ago and so far it seems to be adding moisture to my skin. I will wait to see if I have any other results after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> It was okay for keeping my skin moisturized but as far as this &amp;#34;youthful glow&amp;#34; that&#x27;s supposed to come back to my face - NADA, NYET, NOTHING! Overpriced and I will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Works well on my 60-something skin.</li>
    <li> I also received a free sample in my magazine.  I pulled it out and almost threw it away as I don&#x27;t like anything that feels oily on my skin, especially my face.  But, why not at least try it?  I am so happy I did.  My mature (60 year old) skin felt wonderful!  It goes on like oil but is absorbed quickly and my skin feels so soft and nourished!  No oily feel to it at all.  I like the fragrance as well, to me it is lovely and if it smells \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; to some well, I am grateful for every day of \\&quot;old.\\&quot;  The fragrance seems to disappear shortly after application.  At $20 I feel it is still a bargain because using only 4 to 5 drops per application, it should last a very long time even if you use it twice a day as I do.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot! It&#x27;s too oily for daytime use, but I&#x27;ve used it every night for about 3 weeks now and my skin definitely has a more youthful glow!  Also, it&#x27;s a good price :)</li>
    <li> This made my skin feel so soft and nice.&lt;br /&gt;It did nothing for my sun damage or pores&lt;br /&gt;but it does make your skin feel great</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely brilliant. I am a huge L&#x27;Oreal fan as it is but this made me love them even more. I use a very little amount and it goes a long way. My skin glows without looking oily and the effect lasts throughout the day. Some have mentioned the heavy scent but it does not bother me at all. The best way I can describe how it smells is that it reminds me very much of perfume oils you would find in the Arabian Gulf. However, worry not, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger and goes away in a short amount of time. My face routine is to wash face, apply this oil, then top it off with the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Glow Renewal Day/Night Cream. I have been using those two products once daily for a month and it has also been a month since I wore any type of makeup. I have officially been fixed and will never depend on makeup again! Also, I did not break out even once when the Hope in a Jar product pretty much ruined my face.</li>
    <li> QUALITY Merchandise, Shipped PROMPTLY. One of my favorite beauty secrets.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nice. I have extremely dry skin and I used 2 bottles of this oil in the night time under my cream moisturizer and it definitely helped the dry spots. I was flying through the product though. I switched over to 100% pure extra virgin coconut oil and it does the same thing this did but at a fraction of the price. If you don&#x27;t want to go the all natural root though this is definitely still a nice product. It also smells really nice.</li>
    <li> I have noticed such a difference in my skin after I started using this oil.  The smell has a hint of rose and is very nice.  My skin is so moist and the oil soaks in right away.  I would highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Have not noticed any improvement since I started using the product over three weeks ago.  Took a long time to arrive and postage was expensive.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> really does a good job on my face.</li>
    <li> This oil really does give your complexion a healthy glow.  When I wake up in the morning my skin is not as dull as before I started using the product.  Absorbs nicely too.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I typically have oily skin but as I&#x27;ve gotten older the cold weather really dries out my face.  I was concerned this may break my face out but it asorbs fast and adds a healthy glow even once i apply foundation.  I use 2 times a day along with moisturizer and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I used this for 6 months and noticed no difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Not only makes my dry skin glow but my skin is baby soft.  This is the single best skin care product I have EVER purchased in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s. Amazing product requires just a few drops for entire face. Dampan skin after washing per usual and lightly stroke all over face and neck. Youll look amazing! I apply in a m and again in pm before bed.</li>
    <li> Like so many other reviewers I absolutely LOVE this Glow Oil from L&#x27;Oreal.  The scent is wonderful - like you&#x27;re spending time at the spa.  Yum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my 50+ y.o. skin GLOW!  Not in a greasy, oily way tho.  But in a refreshing, healthy way!  I love the way it feels - been using it for 2 weeks, morning and night, after cleansing and before I use a moisturizer (I use a variety).  You can use a primer before applying foundation, or really.... you don&#x27;t need to with this.  I think it makes a great primer by prepping the skin so that the foundation sits more \\&quot;on top\\&quot; and provides the skin with a beautiful dewey-fresh satiny glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just made my own face spritzer.  I bought a little colored mist spray bottle.  I use distilled water, then several drops of this L&#x27;Oreal Glow Oil, and a couple of other face products I like.  Smells wonderful and gives me an inexpensive \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; during the day.  It doesn&#x27;t mess with my makeup - just feels good and I think it keeps my foundation looking fresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For foundation I use several liquid or cream ones:  L&#x27;Oreal True Match Lumi, Avon Ideal Flawless, Youngblood Liquid Mineral Foundation (very pricey but I like it), Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Treatment Makeup, Physicians Formula Youthful Wear in Light (I have light/med skin - this Phys Form runs a tad bit on the darker side...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of days I mix a couple of these foundations together (yes, I like to experiment!) and I&#x27;m really happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Glow is.... OMG.... WONDERFUL for mature skin!!!  Will be purchasing a 2nd bottle, but it takes so little that it&#x27;ll be a while before I need to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(also, I make my own Vit C serum weekly using distilled water, (I buy, via Amazon, the \\&quot;Making Cosmetics\\&quot; Vitamin C L-ascorbic acid powder - it dissolves the BEST and is high-quality).  Between using the Vit C serum morning and night (I apply this right after I cleanse skin with Witch Hazel Toner or whatever, I apply the Vit C Serum, let it sit a while, then apply the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Glow Oil and let it sit a while before I use a moisturizer, then my foundation of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Met a girlfriend for coffee today and she said \\&quot;your skin looks great!  It looks so fresh and healthy - are you doing something different??\\&quot;  Wow... nice to hear.  (I rest my case)!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my daughter after two weeks.  It made my skin soft but did nothing as far as wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I use daily after I wash my face in the AM. It does have a fragrance but it&#x27;s a fresh herbal scent and dissipates quickly. I like the results.</li>
    <li> Ok, I am Asian, I already have oily skin, so why the hell would I need this product?  I&#x27;m over 40.  Dry patches are starting.  Slight eye wrinkles are setting in.  The oil is starting to dissipate.  Thanks, middle age!  I use this product sparingly, as I still have my oily spots, but I use this oil on my dry patches and it works wonderfully.  It is oil, so yes, it does feel oily, but after it sets in, it leaves a nice feel to my skin and definitely the next morning, my skin feels moisturized and soft.  I am NOT a fan of the scent, although it is herb-y smelling.  I also apply this oil to rough patches on my body like my elbows, knees, ankles, and heels and it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I had not tried this oil before but have used L&#x27;Oreal products for a long time.  I love this oil.  It makes my skin glow and it has helped with my dryness I have on my face. I also have used it on my hair and it works great.  It smells good also  I will buy it again and the price was lower than in the store locally.</li>
    <li> It makes your skin soft, and it makes dry skin shine a little bit.  It&#x27;s nice to have, but we have had such cold weather, and have been in the dry house, and I think it will look better when the weather gets nicer.  But, it&#x27;s feels good on your face!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t care for it . oil is too thick for face. i wouldn&#x27;t buy this item again. its not nice like the serum they used to sell</li>
    <li> This facial oil does what it says--absorbs quickly into dry, mature skin. I liked that about the product. I gave it three stars only because there was a residue scent of rancid oil--olive oil to be exact. The original scent was fine, but when that dissapated, I could smell the old oil.  Perhaps this bottle was in stock for too long, but I could not abide the after scent. I tried several times and still smelled the rancid oil. If this had not been the case, I would have given it five stars.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best oil-based skin moisturizer I have ever used.  It absorbs well into the skin, without a sticky residue, and pairs evenly with makeup foundation.  My skin texture has significantly improved with use of this elixir. So glad I discovered it!</li>
    <li> I only have a sample of the oil and it is amazing.  I have purchased the bottle and I am waiting anxiously for it to reach. I hope is comes tomorrow because I have almost finished the sample.  It goes on so smooth and it help my make-up stay on and fresh. You will not be sorry you purchased this oil. A little does goes a long way just from the sample that was sent to me. I usually do not write reviews  but I just had to in this case.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel really good.  This product was much better than I expected.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I like the facial oil, i think i got it to close to my eyes and caused one to be a bit blury for a bit but got ok, Can&#x27;t actually see a glow as per say. But it does make my face feel soft. Maybe more i use it the more glow i will see.</li>
    <li> This is an ok oil but did not do anything special for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle: Oil for your face that does not make your face oily. My skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used many oils in the past and I have to say that this is the worst smelling thing I have ever put on my face. The smell is overwhelming and does not go away. It starts out smelling like bug spray mixed with cheep perfume and transforms into bug spray and something slightly more pleasing but still overwhelmingly strong. After suffering with the smell for six hours I begin to get a migraine so I finally washed my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I do have a very sensitive sense of smell and it clearly does not effect everyone the same. I only wish I had read a review like this before I wasted my money on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used this product that one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of feel I have to say that it did feel good but the effect was really not any different from plain glycerin or other basic oils.</li>
    <li> This facial oil is perfect for my face not greasy goes on smoothly.  I love the smell of this facial oil and the lightness of it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is not greasy.  My skin absorbs it like water and leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 55 and have spent 100&#x27;s of dollars trying to relieve  facial dryness.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation.  Hate the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this alone for a week.  It&#x27;s miraculous!  Have few wrinkles but the few I had are gone.  It gave me what I wanted, smooth skin, non-flaky skin.  It really does glow.  It&#x27;s a bargain at the price.  I&#x27;m going to stock up in case they decide to discontinue it.  Waited for this type of product for over a decade.  You will not bee disappointed!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product. Feels really good going on your skin and absorbs quickly. I live in Colorado and the winters are brutal with the cold, dry weather. I&#x27;ve only used at night; I warm between my palms and spread over my face and neck followed by my normal night cream. I use almost a full dropper because it doesn&#x27;t seem to smooth out very easily without a lot of pushing and tugging! Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Really like this. I have very dry skin and this oil is light and dissolves in well.  Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really hoping for some miracle results with this stuff. Heard about it from my Auntie, so I&#x27;m trying it. Love it thus far!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS OIL.I PUT IT ON MORNING AND NIGHT.DIANE KEATON DOES THE COMMERCIALS.TRAT YOURSELF.ITS ONLY 15.00.THANKS AMAZON.THEY DIDNT HAVE IT AT TARGET 3WEEKS AGO</li>
    <li> For reference, my skin is normally combination/oily. I rarely get blemishes but my skin is sensitive. This product claims to &amp;#34;Deeply nourish and replenish dull, dry skin to restore skin&#x27;s youthful glow.&amp;#34; Although I used this product as directed (4-5 drops on clean skin), I can honestly say that I did not see any of the benefits that it touted. My skin is fairly parched from the winter cold right now and I experienced none of the &amp;#34;deeply nourishing&amp;#34; attributes nor did it give me a &amp;#34;youthful glow&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This oil has quite a bit of fragrance. Normally, fragrances don&#x27;t bother me too much but this product is almost reminiscent of bug spray to me!&lt;br /&gt;It claims to be non-greasy but I found it to be quite greasy- even when I cut down the amount I was putting on!&lt;br /&gt;This oil also broke me out quite a bit. After a week of use, I noticed small whiteheads on my cheeks and around my mouth. A few days later and I&#x27;ve got painful blemishes on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfect Glow has gotten some great reviews here but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin at all.</li>
    <li> The natural oils would have been a fine scent. However, L&#x27;Oreal somehow felt the need to add a tremendous amount of fragrance. It smells like the creams my grandmother used to out on her face. At 41, I&#x27;m hardly wanting to smell like grandma&#x27;s makeup kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the oil is light. But while it does seem to absorb quickly, I found a slippery residue was always left. I had hoped this would provide the proper oil for my skin so my nose wouldn&#x27;t overproduce on its own. However, no such balance was achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a week and now have broken out in several places. With a fair complexion and redness from rosacea, this oil did nothing to calm my skin. It unfortunately had the opposite effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One positive note I can offer is that is seems to be working well on soothing scar tissue. I will continue to use it to help keep an old scar soft. But otherwise, this perfumed oil will be shelved.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin after 6 mos. with another product line I had to try something else. This is fantastic, my skin is so soft, pores smaller lines are disappearing.</li>
    <li> Since using the Age Perfect Glow Renewal oil, my skin feels wonderfully hydrated and completely refreshed. The fragrance is delightfully relaxing. After using just 5 drops on my face, I rub my hands together, so as to not waste a drop of this fantastic product! My face, neck and hands are grateful for just the right amount of moisture that feels so luxurious and yet so essential to a youthful look.</li>
    <li> Feels great and makes my face feel smoother helps cover fine lines. Goes great under makeup. Great for dry or mature skin</li>
    <li> I like this facial oil because my skin is dry and I need it to lubricate my skin.  I use it under my foundation each day and also at night before bedtime.</li>
    <li> comparable to Clarins. It is excellent for face especially if u have dry skin, I love it. Worth the money</li>
    <li> I like to get some extra moisture on my neck and chest. This doesn&#x27;t always work on my face, as it sometimes causes a rash. But---for the wrinkles in my neck and on my chest it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundation just a mineral powder from Tarte and since I have been using this I rarely use the mineral powder, which is great especially in the summertime going to events and given people hugs, your face doesn&#x27;t get on their clothing....saved about $10 ordering here vs. Local brand stores.</li>
    <li> This oil helped smooth my skin. I also used L&#x27;Oreal whitening cream and my skin has shown great improvement. I strongly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Nice, light scent, and decent moisturizing properties. I ended up not using it anymore when I switched to oil cleansing, which leaves my skin pretty moisturized, but if you use this for a moisturizer of serum it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go a day without using it. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wish the bottle had come sealed rather than open, but the product is good.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great oil</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I feel about this.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin.  Still have dryness in my chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating also and then applying, but with same results.  It smells funny, sort of like medicine instead of essential oils.  Definitely not something I&#x27;ll wear to go out.  I only use this before I go to bed.</li>
    <li> Smooth and softening.</li>
    <li> I read about oils before buying Loreal Age Perfect Glow Renewal Facial Oil. The reviews were good on this product so for the price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly oily skin. I&#x27;m late 30&#x27;s and still get breakouts. I also have rosacea. This does give me a glow, but it also leaves my skin a bit red. I think it just brings out the redness that&#x27;s already there. When I use it in place of moisturizer, my skin stays dewey all day. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is clearer and more hydrated since using it.</li>
