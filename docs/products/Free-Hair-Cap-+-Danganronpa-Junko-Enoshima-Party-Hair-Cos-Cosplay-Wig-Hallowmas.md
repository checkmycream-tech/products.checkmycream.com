      <li>have a more detailed review on my blog: Kriselii.blogspot</li>
      <li>The base wig is styled perfectly already, though - the bangs drape across the forehead just as they&#x27;re supposed to, and the side pieces that hang in front of the ears sort of even the wig out around the face and have a nice slimming effect (great for my rounder face!).</li>
      <li>The seller even included a sweet handwritten note!</li>
      <li>It is that perfect peachy pink color!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll probably have to cut the bangs, but that&#x27;s quite easy to do.</li>
      <li>its amazing quality and the service was quick and im so happy about it being here earlier than expected.&lt;br</li>

      <li>super cute</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite!</li>
      <li>The color is absolutely beautiful- just the lightest of pinks, but with many different shades within it so it looks more realistic.</li>
      <li>It even came with a free wig cap which I was not expecting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It came in great condition with an extra wig cap too.</li>
      <li>There are absolute no thin spots, and it comes very nicely pre styled.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect color and style! Can be a little heavy because of the pigtails, but you get used it it. Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> came in earlier than estimated delivery. i have 12 wigs and it is definitely in my top 3. the pigtails are detachable and looks great with and without them in. i have other long wigs and this one doesn&#x27;t tangle as easily as the other ones, nor do the ends get frizzy. not using for cosplays; just for fun. i have gotten many compliments on it already going out while wearing it:)</li>
    <li> super cute i get so many compliments on it</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing quality , looks exactly as shown in the picture , and i highly reccomend it to all junko cosplayers !!!</li>
    <li> The wig is excellent in quality (relatively light for size, clip-able pigtails attach seamlessly, and the colour is perfect for the character). Furthermore, it&#x27;s very soft and falls quite naturally. It came a few days later than the end of the approximate shipping time, so if you&#x27;re looking to use it for a convention I would definitely try to purchase it early. Otherwise, the product was shipped in great condition and is selling for a fair price.</li>
    <li> Very soft and thick, amazing quality for such a low price. Looks perfect as Junko, curl is subtle and nice and clips are very long and accurate.</li>
    <li> Dangan Ronpa cosplayers can be 100% assured that this product is exactly how it looks in the picture. It is that perfect peachy pink color!</li>
    <li> Been meaning to post a review for this wig for a while now. I have to say, this wig is absolutely perfect! I ordered two, one for my friend and one for myself. The wigs came nicely packaged together. The wigs themselves are absolutely gorgeous. There is no netting to be seen and the pigtails do not get get tangled easily. The only complaint I have is that you can see a bit of the clip that the ponytail is attached to. Not a big deal at all. Overall, I am super pleased with this wig!</li>
    <li> The fibers both look and feel nice, and it needs very little styling.  The bangs are already a good length and shape for Junko.  The pigtails shed fairly easily though, and at least one of them the hair is sort of loose and slips around when you open the clip, so I have to be sure to tuck it in to the right part, though that might not be usual.</li>
    <li> Super soft and lovely! It&#x27;s a very comfortable wig, and very very thick and lush. There are absolute no thin spots, and it comes very nicely pre styled. It actually looks better than the main picture in my opinion, it has more of a curly taper in real life which better matches Junko&#x27;s ponytail shape.</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing ! SERIOUSLY BUY IT IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR A JUNKO WIG. omfg it is like the perfect amount of fullness and it doesn&#x27;t have that patchy look. I&#x27;ll put up pics later</li>
    <li> Just the same as anyone else, always leery of buying wigs off the internet but this one impressed the heck out of me. The fibers are soft and easy to manage, and like someone else mentioned on here - it is very comfortable to wear. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase~</li>
    <li> This wig is gorgeous. The fiber is high quality and the color is perfect for Junko&#x27;s hair. I really love this wig. 15/10 would recommend. I will definitely be buying from this seller again</li>
    <li> I just ordered this wig last week and it&#x27;s already here! I have ordered other wigs before and it usually takes about 3 weeks to get here so this was quick!&lt;br /&gt;The base wig is full with no weird thin or bald areas at all! The pigtails are quite thick and layered nicely!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to cosplay Junko, or even anyone wanting a lolita wig! I definitely will buy from Anangel again!</li>
    <li> First of all, I was shocked at how soon my order came! It was expected around Febuary 11th-21st, and instead came January 24th! The color is exactly what it is in the picture, and it came seperated in two bags so the hair wouldn&#x27;t become one big clump. The two clips for the pigtails came in one and were conviniently clipped together for easy seperation. It even came with a free wig cap which I was not expecting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I get some photos of me wearing the wig, I&#x27;ll be sure to post them on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am amazed by the quality, the only thing I disliked was that it came with a strange smell, but so have a lot of wigs of mine, and leaving them to air out gets rid of the smell most of the time.</li>
    <li> I am always hesitant to purchasing wigs from anywhere than sites I&#x27;ve used for years, but after reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot since I couldn&#x27;t find this style and color any other way. This wig is FULL and luxurious, really soft and matte. It&#x27;s unbelievable, which is why I&#x27;m writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;Product is better than described and is perfect for Junko.</li>
    <li> Wig came really soon after I ordered it and I was very pleased with the quality. The twin tails aren&#x27;t as thick and luscious as in the stock image but they are still long, layered, and easy to attach to the main head piece. The color is absolutely spot on.</li>
    <li> I was a bit nervous about buying this wig as this is my first cosplay wig because of all the horror storries I read about buying cosplay wigs and costumes from amazon/ebay. But now that I have there was nothing for my to worry about! The wig looks just like the one in the picutre and is very soft to the touch. The wig looks more strawberry blond- pinkish but its still very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs sweep over you face just like how Junko&#x27;s do. If anyone is planning to cosplay as Junko Enoshima i highly recomend this wig! I cant wait to wear this to my first con in july!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Feb 20th and I thought that it will come on april 1st but It came in on March 7th. The wig is amazing and great quality. It doesnt tangle! Its perfect. If you want to cosplay as Junko then this is your wig!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful wig. It&#x27;s a lovely soft, sandy pink and is slightly wavy. It&#x27;s fibers are very soft and the pig tail clips are very strong. You&#x27;ll probably have to cut the bangs, but that&#x27;s quite easy to do.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig after reading all the other positive reviews and was not disappointed! excellent color and quality, very full and soft</li>
    <li> This is an awesom junko wig. I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect wig for junko and this is it. The color is spot on and it shipped really fast. The only problem I had was how thick the wig was. From reading previous reveiws i was convinced this wig would be really thick. But unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t as thick as it could have been. I wish the base and twin tails could be a bit thicker. As devistaed as I was about the thickness, the quality was great! Overall this is a great wig for any junko cosplayer and would highly recommend it😺</li>
    <li> This is so life-like and real I was completely amazed at the craftsmanship of this wig and believe me as a MOM to a cosplay teen I have ordered my share of wigs etc... I am shocked at the quality and the quickness of the shipping very reasonable cost and well worth it</li>
    <li> The wig is the perfect color for Junko&#x27;s hair and the fibers are very soft as well which makes it easy to comb through. The colors are also well blended to give the wig a nice, natural look.  But... This might just be my wig but one ponytail has much more volume than the other and I totally regret trying to style it because the tips on the ponytails are EXTREMELY frizzy. I tried driving it down with some hairspray and a straightener and the frizz is just too persistent it wont actually lie flat. Every time I expose the fibers to heat it immedietely starts to go frizzy! I honestly cant style this without the fibers going haywire on me and I&#x27;m doing this on the lowest heat settings I have.  I tried curling the wig using the hot water and curler method only  to have all of the pink color taken out. Now it looks like tinted fishing line. The softness of the wig was also removed and now the texture feels like stiff plastic. This wig is good in a bind and for the price but for the level of styling I wanted and the stubborness of this wig I&#x27;ll stick to Arda. I think this wig is only good for minimal styling. However for it&#x27;s price I would recommend this wig anyway despite my issues.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Color is very accurate to Junko&#x27;s hair color. Definitely recommend for anyone thinking of cosplaying her.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig! Super soft and worth the price. Hope to do business again.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. This wig is the bomb! My absolute favorite! As an experienced cosplayer and wig buyer, I have to say that the quality of this wig is the best of the best. It is a beautiful light pinkish blonde color, perfect for junkos shade. It is a thicker wig and you cannot see through the wig. The base wig is cut very nicely and you can sweep the bangs across your face just like junkos. It looks beautiful even without the pigtails! Like a short bob. With the pigtails on, however, the wig is even better. The pigtails are absolutely gorgeous. They&#x27;re thick and luxurious! The pigtails are styled just like junkos hair, with waves and curls. The pigtails are claw clips, and I have found that it works best to attach them by seperating two small sections of the base wig and tying them in ponytails, then clamping on to the ponytails with the claw clips. By doing this, the pigtails are very secure. The shipping was fast and it came in a week and a half. The seller even included a sweet handwritten note! The only drawback was that the wig did smell very funny, but after using scented detangler to brush out and smooth out the wig the smell was replaced. Overall, Great service, great wig, fast shipping!  I ordered another wig from this seller!</li>
    <li> This is the nicest wig that ive ever bought! its so silky and soft. the product comes with three parts, the bangs, and two pigtails. the pigtails are easy to attach and it works well if youre also trying to do junkos flirty persona. the color looks nice! a little more pink than the photo but its adorable. it arrived a week and a half after i ordered it. it came with a sweet little note. the only thing it needs is a little bit of bang trimming but thats just me! i love this wig. this is best junko wig out there!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best quality wigs I have ever bought! It&#x27;s the perfect color and it&#x27;s so silky, it looks just like it does in the picture. I didn&#x27;t even have to style it. It got here weeks before expected. This is one of the best experiences I&#x27;ve had on amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the exact same color as pictured plus it requires little to no styling. The bangs were a tad long though so I had to trim them a bit but other than that this wig is amazing. (especially for Junko cosplay) Also the wig came two weeks early so I&#x27;m really pleased with</li>
    <li> Excellent condition &amp; quality. Arrived earlier than stated. 10/10 would order from Anangel again if I ever needed to.</li>
    <li> Awesome Junko wig!! The pigtails are sad but it still looks very nice for a Junko wig!</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely perfect. I love it so much. It&#x27;s very comfortable and required little styling. It&#x27;s a great color and came extremely quickly. I recommend this wig to any Junko cosplayer, because it cannot get better than this.</li>
    <li> I was really nervous about ordering this wig because I didn&#x27;t know if it would come exactly as pictured. Boy was I wrong to worry! This wig is fantastic! The color is absolutely beautiful- just the lightest of pinks, but with many different shades within it so it looks more realistic. The pig tails are really easy to attack to the main wig, and are even longer then they look in the picture, as well as very thick. The main wig is cut very well for Junko, with long pieces in the front but pretty short in the back. Even the bangs sweep across your face just like hers do! It requires very, very little styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I walk around, the hair just glides around my shoulders and it&#x27;s so beautiful I can&#x27;t even describe it! When I first put this wig on, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to take it off. I wore it around my house for hours! Literally the best wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased, I am BEYOND satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a Junko wig (or even just a wig for Lolita even) this is definitely the wig for you! And it&#x27;s not even that expensive. I&#x27;m amazed!</li>
    <li> Honestly, this wig is wonderful!.. I love it!.. Very nice length.. And texture was marvelous.. The only thing is that it was more of pinky peach than blonde.. Buuut I&#x27;ve grown to like it a lot!.. I highly recommend anyone wanting to be Junko to get THIS wig</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the 17th of January, and was told it would not arrive until the 12th of February. It&#x27;s January 22nd, and it arrived! That&#x27;s less than a week. I Was really surprised! When I opened it, it was wrapped in netting, and a tightly sealed ziplock bag. When I took out the wig, the quality was super amazing and it&#x27;s so soft! The colour looks exactly like the picture! The styling is perfect, and the wig itself is just amazing. It came with a free hair cap too, which works really well! It&#x27;s better than the one I already have!&lt;br /&gt;Quick, Clean, and wonderful. Will definitely order from here again!</li>
    <li> What a wonderful wig! I was initially skeptical, as many of the reviews of this wig say exactly the same thing and I was worried that some of them may have been fake. I took a chance on this wig, and I&#x27;m very glad I did. It&#x27;s one of my favorites! The hair is long and thick, though it will take some teasing to style the pigtails up like hers. The base wig is styled perfectly already, though - the bangs drape across the forehead just as they&#x27;re supposed to, and the side pieces that hang in front of the ears sort of even the wig out around the face and have a nice slimming effect (great for my rounder face!). 10/10 on the color, too, as that was one of my main concerns. Definitely buy this wig if you&#x27;re looking to cosplay Junko!</li>
    <li> Such an amazing wig. Just as all of the other reviews , it is spot on in color and layered nicely. I just ordered this last saturday and It came today! So pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on January 4, arrived January 16- almost 2 weeks before the estimated arrival date. The wig isn&#x27;t as pink as the picture, more of a pink tint that&#x27;s great for Junko&#x27;s hair. The wig is really soft! It came in great condition with an extra wig cap too. All in all, this wig is worth the money! I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
    <li> This wig is very nice.  It is the perfect mix of blonde and pink.  For such a cheap price, I was expecting it to be very thin and tangled.  However, it&#x27;s not!  It is very thick and no matter how you part it, you can&#x27;t see the netting (in the base wig).  The base wig has the perfect bangs for Junko already, and the pigtails are nice and soft.  The wig barely needs any styling, but I teased my pigtails and added wefts from a different company to make them thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this wig to all Junko cosplays (or anyone needing a peachy pigtail wig)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the wig on December 22, and the wig came on January 12.  It might have even come faster if it wasn&#x27;t holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;I have a more detailed review on my blog: Kriselii.blogspot</li>
    <li> I love this wig so much, the color is exactly as pictured and is the perfect shade for Junko&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> The quality is great and the pony tails are easy to use. The shipping went well and it came earlier than expected. If you&#x27;re buying a Junko wig I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
    <li> Okay so COSPLAYERS DOING JUNKO ENOSHIMA. One word: YES.&lt;br /&gt;This wig is perfect. its amazing quality and the service was quick and im so happy about it being here earlier than expected.&lt;br /&gt;The ponytails are clip on which you can attach anywhere which means you can even go with one ponytail or no tail at all! I absolutely recommended this wig! The color is just a portrayed in the picture and its quite lovely! You will absolutely enjoy this wig!</li>
    <li> The color of the wig is exactly like Junko&#x27;s, and very soft! Another good thing is that the ponytails dont tangle, and look very nice even after wearing the wig for a long time. They&#x27;re very easy to attach and stay the way you put them, and dont slip. The wig definitely is worth its money, and I recommend it to anybody who wants to cosplay Enoshima.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good wig. The fibers are really soft and are easy to comb out. The big downside to this item is that the fibers in the ponytails are easily tugged out. There is also this weird brown string that is attached to the clip. It isn&#x27;t a big deal, but very annoying for me. I&#x27;ve been cosplaying for a while and so I&#x27;m pretty good with caring for wigs. I&#x27;m happy that this one doesn&#x27;t need as much care as some of my other long wigs.</li>
