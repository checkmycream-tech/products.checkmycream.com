      <li>works great.</li>
      <li>Great price for an OEM replacement.  </li>
      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>perfect fit into the shaver.</li>
      <li>This fresh battery makes my shaver fly.</li>
      <li>This was a good fresh battery.</li>
      <li>Ship fast great.</li>
      <li>In any case, I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I will never buy a battery online again, and I&#x27;d encourage others to make sure they have the correct tools to install a shaver battery themselves before purchasing this battery.  </li>
      <li>I would return but the postage is more than the battery.</li>
      <li>This one did the job just right, fits in the case, soldered right in and holds a great charge.  </li>
      <li>Holds a charge well, and easy to install.</li>
      <li>Battery installed easily soldering the tabs to the circut board.  </li>
      <li>Not too easy for me as I am all thumbs.  </li>
      <li>It works as good as when it was new, this saved me about $65</li>
      <li>and it seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>This product seems fine.  </li>
      <li>shipped within  a reasonable time, which was nice.  </li>
      <li>Oh--please be sure to dispose of the old cell according to hazardous materials rules.</li>
      <li>You need to solder this battery in so make sure you have the necessary tools to complete this install successfully!</li>
      <li>Be sure to mark the positive side on the printed circuit board so you can install the battery with the correct polarity.  </li>
      <li>The one sent is too large to fit into the razors case.</li>
      <li>Exact replacement, quick delivery, a lot cheaper than razor replacement.  </li>
      <li>If you get this as replacement for your Norelco shaver... be aware that it has to be soldered into the shaver...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give the bottom line first:  </li>
      <li>However, if one has the competency and equipment (soldering iron and Torx T-9 screwdriver) to replace it, then s/he certainly should have the competency and equipment (voltmeter) to check the polarity.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast; it took a charge and has performed well.  </li>
      <li>Whoever manages this listing should change the picture to show what you actually receive rather than the original battery.</li>
      <li>One oddity;unlike my original battery, where the power available decreased gradually until it died, this one runs at 100% until the end and then dies quickly.  </li>
      <li>AFTER MUCH STRUGGLING I MANAGED TO SOLDER IN NEW TABS ON NEW BATTERY.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t measure, and I&#x27;m not sure whether this one is better.  </li>
      <li>It works like new.</li>
      <li>RECIEVED NEW BATTERY WHICH DOES NOT SHOW</li>
      <li>You have to unsolder the old battery and solder the new one&#x27;s leads into the razor.</li>
      <li>The battery brought new life to my old razor.</li>
      <li>Installed the battery in my old Norelco razor by prying the tabs off the old battery and soldering them to the new battery tabs.</li>
      <li>I made the replacement easier by prying the tabs off the old battery instead of desoldering them from the circuit board and soldered the new battery&#x27;s tabs to the old ones--took about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Runs the razor for a whole week of daily shaves for me.</li>
      <li>If you do not have a solder iron or solder, if you do not have experience disconnecting and reconnecting lead wires, and if you have already thrown the old battery away, I do NOT recommend purchasing this item.</li>
      <li>Remember that NiCad batteries have a &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; and should be discharged completely before recharging so the battery retains the maximum amount.</li>
      <li>I replaced the battery in my 12 year old Norelco.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason I purchased this battery cell is that my old battery cell seemed to have a shortening life.  </li>
      <li>quite a tricky operation which requires a major dis-assembly, using a solder gun to remove the old battery and nimble fingers to get the new one installed and re-assembled.  </li>
      <li>Also, a standard screw driver will open the razor, the special tool advertised with this is not needed if you own a screw driver that has a small phillips tip and is thin enough to fit into the slot on the razor.</li>
      <li>I did not have the correct tools to open the shaver or solder the new battery in place, so I took it to a battery replacement store, where they did the installation for me at no cost.  </li>
      <li>The old battery wouldn&#x27;t last for one shave.</li>
      <li>In order to install the new battery (which is solid white, says made in china, and does NOT tell you which end is positive nor negative), you must look at the old one, and you must have a soldering iron.</li>
      <li>And since the battery you receive may be all white with no markings for + or - (positive or negative) you will need to use the old battery as a guide.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This was a good fresh battery. Holds a charge well, and easy to install. It has tabs on each end to solder to.</li>
    <li> The battery I received does NOT look like the one in the picture. The battery in the razor does. In order to install the new battery (which is solid white, says made in china, and does NOT tell you which end is positive nor negative), you must look at the old one, and you must have a soldering iron. The battery shown does not show the wire at each end. You have to unsolder the old battery and solder the new one&#x27;s leads into the razor. And since the battery you receive may be all white with no markings for + or - (positive or negative) you will need to use the old battery as a guide.  If you do not have a solder iron or solder, if you do not have experience disconnecting and reconnecting lead wires, and if you have already thrown the old battery away, I do NOT recommend purchasing this item. If you do have a soldering iron, etc. then go ahead. Also, a standard screw driver will open the razor, the special tool advertised with this is not needed if you own a screw driver that has a small phillips tip and is thin enough to fit into the slot on the razor. Whoever manages this listing should change the picture to show what you actually receive rather than the original battery.</li>
    <li> Ship fast great. Great price, Only problem no + or - signs and no writing on battery.  ni-cad ??? Does not match photo shown</li>
    <li> RECIEVED NEW BATTERY WHICH DOES NOT SHOW PLUS OR MINUS ENDS SO YOU MUST COMPARE TO OLD BATTERY VERY CAREFULLY AND MARK POLARITY YOURSELF. AFTER MUCH STRUGGLING I MANAGED TO SOLDER IN NEW TABS ON NEW BATTERY. SOMEHOW MANAGED TO GET EVERYTHING BACK IN IT&#x27;S PROPER PLACE AND SHAVER WORKS. WHEW! NOT A JOB FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. BUT BATTERY IS A BARGAIN FROM AMAZON.</li>
    <li> You need to solder this battery in so make sure you have the necessary tools to complete this install successfully!</li>
    <li> The battery I received doesn&#x27;t look like the one pictured, it had no writing, not even the polarity. I would return but the postage is more than the battery. The one sent is too large to fit into the razors case.</li>
    <li> Installed the battery in my old Norelco razor by prying the tabs off the old battery and soldering them to the new battery tabs. Charged the battery and have just had to recharge it after 3 weeks of shaves. The old battery wouldn&#x27;t last for one shave. The battery brought new life to my old razor. Would recommend this product. Need to have ability to use a soldering iron.</li>
    <li> This product seems fine.  Shipping was fast; it took a charge and has performed well.  Only time will tell how long it will last.  Other reviewers who complained that the cell did not have polarity markings are correct.  However, if one has the competency and equipment (soldering iron and Torx T-9 screwdriver) to replace it, then s/he certainly should have the competency and equipment (voltmeter) to check the polarity.  Anyway, the cell is constructed like any other cell, with the positive end having a \\&quot;cap\\&quot; and the negative end being plain flat.  Replacing this battery is not a task for the novice--if you don&#x27;t have soldering experience, don&#x27;t try it.  In any case, I&#x27;m satisfied.  Oh--please be sure to dispose of the old cell according to hazardous materials rules.</li>
    <li> The battery cell came as described.  A soldering iron and solder are required to install it to the shaver.  Not too easy for me as I am all thumbs.  But I got it installed and it seems to work fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The reason I purchased this battery cell is that my old battery cell seemed to have a shortening life.  I really didn&#x27;t measure, and I&#x27;m not sure whether this one is better.  In any case, I am ambivalent about the difference it made.</li>
    <li> These NiCd batteries last a few years usually, so replacing them is expected.  This one did the job just right, fits in the case, soldered right in and holds a great charge.  Runs the razor for a whole week of daily shaves for me.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ll give the bottom line first:  I will never buy a battery online again, and I&#x27;d encourage others to make sure they have the correct tools to install a shaver battery themselves before purchasing this battery.  It&#x27;ll save you a ton of headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery shipped within  a reasonable time, which was nice.  I did not have the correct tools to open the shaver or solder the new battery in place, so I took it to a battery replacement store, where they did the installation for me at no cost.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a faulty battery, or if the battery was not installed properly, but the shaver would not run or charge once it was installed.  I took it to a different battery replacement store to test the charge on the battery, and there was no charge.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s standard practice to send these batteries uncharged, but it was disappointing at any rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After emailing my concern and order number on Friday morning, I received a follow up email within 24 hours, suggesting I call during business hours to see if they could help with the problem.  However, I got this email late in the day on a Friday, and by the time I got the message and called, their shop was closed. Normally, this time frame for a follow up-contact wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me, but in this instance it was a little frustrating, given the fact that I had taken this project on for my boyfriend, who in the meantime is shaver-less.  I received a return phone call around noon on Monday, and was basically told I shouldn&#x27;t have taken it to a battery replacement shop,and that they could not return or refund my purchase.  They did offer me the option to ship the shaver and battery to their store so they could further diagnose the issue, but at this point, I think I am going to break down and buy my boyfriend a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Battery installed easily soldering the tabs to the circut board.  Charge lasts about 2 weeks.  One oddity;unlike my original battery, where the power available decreased gradually until it died, this one runs at 100% until the end and then dies quickly.  Remember that NiCad batteries have a &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; and should be discharged completely before recharging so the battery retains the maximum amount.</li>
    <li> My old cordless shaver was dead for about 6 months and I was tired of using shaving cream and a rasor. I ordered this battery and I have the correct equipment to replace this battery at home. This fresh battery makes my shaver fly. It works like new.</li>
    <li> Great price for an OEM replacement.  As others mentioned before, I have to solder twice to figure out the positive &amp; negative terminals. Still working as of 28Jan2013</li>
    <li> I replaced the battery in my 12 year old Norelco. It works as good as when it was new, this saved me about $65</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement battery for my razor</li>
    <li> If you get this as replacement for your Norelco shaver... be aware that it has to be soldered into the shaver... quite a tricky operation which requires a major dis-assembly, using a solder gun to remove the old battery and nimble fingers to get the new one installed and re-assembled.  Be sure to mark the positive side on the printed circuit board so you can install the battery with the correct polarity.  So far it accepts a charge and runs the shaver about the same speed as the OEM battery... which lasted about 4 years with not much use.</li>
