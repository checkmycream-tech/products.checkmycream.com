      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and have been very pleased.</li>
      <li>So here I am, ordering this for the first time for myself, and I&#x27;m thinking of my answer when someone asks me why I&#x27;m using women&#x27;s skincare products, but I just sort of got bailed out by the Amazon description, &amp;#34;for Unisex&amp;#34;  LOL!!!  </li>
      <li>I use them because they&#x27;re best for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>good for clean de face without drying th skin</li>
      <li>Love it, love it, love it.  </li>
      <li>This has become my favorite cleanser.  </li>
      <li>My favorite cleanser of all time.</li>
      <li>If it were more affordable, I would use it and nothing else on my face.  </li>
      <li>The price was good and was delivered right away.</li>
      <li>But I just want to let everybody knows that this product works, it helps remove my acne for good:) and it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t give that irritation feeling</li>
      <li>Apart from smelling good, I can&#x27;t find anything positive about this product.</li>
      <li>This is the best twenty something dollars I&#x27;ve spent on a face product.</li>

      <li>Huge plus.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective AND removes makeup.</li>
      <li>It deep cleans, smells great, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed without over drying.</li>

      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean oily skin very well.</li>
      <li>it smells amazing and it leaves skin clean and soft for long time</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s better to just use a proper exfoliant or scrub every once in a while.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling super clean but not dry.</li>

      <li>I have normal to oily skin.</li>
      <li>Immediately afterwards, I apply the Clarins toning lotion with Iris, then the HydraQuench normal to combination skin face cream.</li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I normally use the variety without the micro pearls</li>
      <li>I have dry, sensitive skin with occasional breakouts, and this cleanser is gentle on the skin and moisturizes.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend, especially for mixed or oily skin.</li>

    <li> This has become my favorite cleanser.  It&#x27;s creamy but not oily or greasy.  Leaves your skin feeling super clean but not dry. Wonderful smell,, like a tuscan spa.</li>
    <li> Leave face feeling clean and soft.</li>
    <li> Really cleans skin without over drying or leaving residue.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and have been very pleased.</li>

    <li> All Clarins products are wonderfuland this is no exception. Leaves skin thoroughly clean but never irritated or dry. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because I normally use the variety without the micro pearls and I think I will go back to that after I finish this bottle since I don&#x27;t notice any difference with the pearls. I think it&#x27;s better to just use a proper exfoliant or scrub every once in a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved Clarins products for several years. I use them because they&#x27;re best for my sensitive skin. This product, however, made my skin so dry and tight that it hurt to smile. I thought maybe my skin needed to adjust, but after using it every other day for a week and a half, I tossed it.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t change or use another product.. This is a def use. Skin is clear and healthy after use...Love it.</li>
    <li> I have severely oily skin, and have for as long as I can remember.  This is the first cleanser I&#x27;ve ever had that&#x27;s left my face SQUEAKY clean.  If it were more affordable, I would use it and nothing else on my face.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave it feeling overly dry.  It did seem to keep the oil at bay during the day, which nothing else had ever done.</li>
    <li> Have been using this one for years. Very effective at any climate. Highly recommend, especially for mixed or oily skin.</li>
    <li> Leaves an unpleasant feeling of sticky residue on skin after use. Doesn&#x27;t clean oily skin very well. Tends to exacerbate skin inflammation on problem areas. Apart from smelling good, I can&#x27;t find anything positive about this product. Extremely expensive for what is does. I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is the best! I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve been punishing my skin with soap all these years. I apply a small amount on my finger tips and wash my face with it in the shower. Immediately afterwards, I apply the Clarins toning lotion with Iris, then the HydraQuench normal to combination skin face cream. I&#x27;ve received compliments on my skin since using the Clarins products, which I am grateful for as I only began to have problems with my skin after moving to a different climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hurray for Clarins!</li>
    <li> I received my product promptly. I think I saved $1-2 buying through this vendor, but the purchase didn&#x27;t qualify for the Club Clarins points. Not a deal breaker but rewards programs were invented for people like me, so I was a bit disappointed. Otherwise, the vendor sent me what I wanted when they said they would.</li>
    <li> Makes the smoothest skin and helps with out brakes.</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser of all time. I have normal to oily skin. It deep cleans, smells great, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed without over drying.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mother not for myself, but she is very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it.  Expensive, but you don&#x27;t need much, so it lasts a long time.  Skin feels great after using.</li>
    <li> I never write a review..ever! But I just want to let everybody knows that this product works, it helps remove my acne for good:) and it&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t give that irritation feeling</li>
    <li> This is the best twenty something dollars I&#x27;ve spent on a face product. A small amount goes a long way, so you only need a drop to wash your face. I have dry, sensitive skin with occasional breakouts, and this cleanser is gentle on the skin and moisturizes. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I loooove this cleanser. I have somewhat problem skin with half dry half oily and occasional breakouts. This makes your skin feel really clean and helps prevent breakouts. It&#x27;s gentle and effective AND removes makeup. Huge plus. A tiny bit goes a long way so it last a long time!</li>
    <li> So they market this as unisex, but its sold in the department store in the women&#x27;s section.  So as a guy I accidentally used it when there was no soap once, and wow, I learned that all that expensive women&#x27;s ablution paraphernalia might actually be worth the money after all!  I have oily skin, and soap just never cleaned my facial skin, ever.  That is until I tried this stuff.  So I went to the department store counter where I inquired about the &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; version of this product because I didn&#x27;t want to use the women&#x27;s stuff...  Anyway, the salesperson said that the men&#x27;s version is just not as good.  So here I am, ordering this for the first time for myself, and I&#x27;m thinking of my answer when someone asks me why I&#x27;m using women&#x27;s skincare products, but I just sort of got bailed out by the Amazon description, &amp;#34;for Unisex&amp;#34;  LOL!!!  This stuff is the real deal if you have oily skin.  There, I did it.</li>
