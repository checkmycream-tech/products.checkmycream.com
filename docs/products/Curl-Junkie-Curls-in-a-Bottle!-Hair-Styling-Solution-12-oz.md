      <li>This product has light hold which is perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell so good.</li>
      <li>I wish I had loved this product,  </li>
      <li>This is a good product</li>
      <li>good</li>
      <li>This not only smells wonderful, it WORKS wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I use this curls in bottle stuff on top of it as a styler and it smells great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>You can view this method online or certainly use whatever method works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>AMAZING definition.  </li>
      <li>I had used many curl defining/enhancing products, including highly-rated, good ones like Curl Keepper and Rocking Curls/Confident Coils by Jessicurl.</li>
      <li>It just gives curls a nice definition.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need a lot to get nice curls.</li>
      <li>This makes my curls shiny, bouncy and clump nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try it out again when it gets warm.</li>
      <li>I really must say that this is THE best hair product to control frizz that I have used.  </li>
      <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;hair sprayed&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The smoothing lotion is amazing and by far THE BEST detangler I have ever used</li>
      <li>They are all pretty good at controlling my hair in their own way.</li>
      <li>I love the Curl Junkie line. :)</li>
      <li>I use this and top of my curls with just a lil bit of mop top anti frizz gel</li>
      <li>This is one of the better products I&#x27;ve used to create curls, but I will say this--</li>
      <li>:-)</li>
      <li>It defined most of my curls</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve given it 3 stars because I think it will work better with longer hair.</li>
      <li>So glad my husband talked me into ordering this, I was hesitant</li>
      <li>If you need a lot of control, this might not be it, but it&#x27;s the best moderate control product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I heard putting the CJ Smoothing Lotion on top helps but it has glycerin</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this.  </li>
      <li>and for more than 1 day.</li>
      <li>I use it on top of the gel that I use each day.</li>
      <li>absolutely love this product</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I really, really wanted to like this product after seeing all the great reviews on here and on Youtube.  </li>
      <li>and I still love it.</li>
      <li>Going to try them with the KC to see if I get even better results.</li>
      <li>I get that with this--along with a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>(For more information about the Curly Girl method, see [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl:</li>
      <li>Second and third-day-curls look great too ! !</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like an overpowering smell but like a light berry kind of scent.</li>
      <li>I have used tons of curl products: Ouidad, AG recoil, kinky curls and many more.</li>
      <li>I found it helped my curls clump and stay formed, though they were more relaxed than with  Curl Keeper and JC.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy and it controls the curls.</li>
      <li>I use about three or four quarter-sized dollops of the Coco Creme on my shoulder-length hair, top it with some Curls in a Bottle, and add some Farouk Systems Biosilk Style By Farouk Systems For Women.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but this is the best \\&quot;curly hair\\&quot; and Curly Girl Method friendly product line I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I&#x27;ve used DEVA, Jessicurl, MyHoneyChild, Curly Hair Solutions, Jane Carter Solutions, and Mop Top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is super amazing.</li>
      <li>Lovely frizz free, bouncy curls.</li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s best to put in after a bit of leave-in conditioner and while still quite damp though not soaking wet.</li>
      <li>If you have curly hair (for reference, I am 3A/3B with fine hair) and want a styling product that defines, gives light but non-crunchy hold, and reduces frizz, there is nothing better than Curl Junkie&#x27;s Curls in a Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It scrunches out easily and controls the frizz.  </li>
      <li>For my hair type (fine, wavy/curly 2B/C), this stuff is amazing and gives me consistent but not producty curls.</li>
      <li>Great product;) fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff for natural hair!  </li>
      <li>It makes my little curls look awesome.  </li>
      <li>It smells light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If I want just light hold and tons of shine, I use it by itself over a leave-in.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to try a silicone free styling product.</li>
      <li>I bought Curls in a Bottle and have always liked it, but my favorite results came when I mixed it 50/50 with water in a spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>I heard such good things</li>
      <li>The best part is that it it seems to leave no build-up or residue and is not the least bit sticky or crunchy.  </li>
      <li>, i didnt get hard and held perfectly will order more in the future i love it</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the CJ line, but this particular product, combined with [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>So far I have tried 4 different curl junkie products and have LOVED 3 of them, the  4th was just okay.</li>
      <li>oz.]], leave me with consistently great-looking hair!</li>
      <li>I have fine very curly hair but a lot of it.</li>
      <li>hair is wavy and fine, but I have a lot of it, and using this along with the Coco Creme Lite really brings out the waves in my hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried Diva curl and Ouidad lines as well as many products that are available at my local drug store, so I have a lot to compare this with.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and have tried many products, the curl junkie products are by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have type 3b/3c hair and this stuff holds my hair all day in the summer with humidity and all and is good for second day hair without too much day 2 work.</li>
      <li>Since this is an expensive product, I tend not to use a lot of it, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the more I use, the better my hair looks; when I really saturate and coat my hair with CIAB,my waves turn into ringlets and I have great</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have fine curly hair and wanted something that left zero crunch.  I bought Curls in a Bottle and have always liked it, but my favorite results came when I mixed it 50/50 with water in a spray bottle.  I spray this on non-towel-dried hair right out of the shower, comb through with a wide tooth comb, and let air dry.  AMAZING definition.  The biggest thing I can say is that when I&#x27;ve worn my hair curly before: no compliments.  Using this product: I get compliments every day.  And like another reviewer said, I was able to get a great looking 3rd day with just a little water finger-run through the ends.  No grease, great volume, still great definition.  I was going to wash it that third day, but it looked too good!&lt;br /&gt;Nice to have 2 times as much product for the money too (because of cutting with water).  Thank you Curl Junkie!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this.  If I want just light hold and tons of shine, I use it by itself over a leave-in. It makes my little curls look awesome.  If I want stronger hold and multiple day hair, I will mix with a little gel. This, in my opinion is Curl Junkie&#x27;s best styler. Make a good refresher too...good frizz killer!</li>
    <li> I have 4C class hair  and this product didn&#x27;t hold my curls as I thought it would.  As soon as my hair dried it became a course kinky texture again.  I even used it as a setting product for a twist out and even though it soften my hair, the curl pattern didn&#x27;t hold then either.</li>
    <li> I started following the Curly Girl method (no silicones or sulfates) just under six months ago, and some Curl Junkie products --including this Curls in a Bottle -- were amongst the first few products I ordered. I absolutely love the CJ line, but this particular product, combined with [[ASIN:B0036QFEA6 Curl Junkie Coffee-Coco Curl Creme-Lite, 8 fl. oz.]], leave me with consistently great-looking hair! (For more information about the Curly Girl method, see [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]].)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is wavy and fine, but I have a lot of it, and using this along with the Coco Creme Lite really brings out the waves in my hair. I use about three or four quarter-sized dollops of the Coco Creme on my shoulder-length hair, top it with some Curls in a Bottle, and add some Farouk Systems Biosilk Style By Farouk Systems For Women. Rock Hard Gelee Firm Hold 6.0-Ounce / 150 Mlto hold the waves. The result are waves that help make my hair the best it&#x27;s ever looked.  Since this is an expensive product, I tend not to use a lot of it, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the more I use, the better my hair looks; when I really saturate and coat my hair with CIAB,my waves turn into ringlets and I have great shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I really love about the Curl Junkie line is that you can mix and match the products; they really do play well together, although certain combos tend to give me better curls and waves than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the bottle is about 12 ounces, it lasts a long time since you use so little. I use it about twice a week, and am about half-way through the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product and one of my Holy Grail hair products!</li>
    <li> Now, CIAB does exactly what is says... except... no matter how little or much I use, I get crunch. I&#x27;m going to try it out again when it gets warm. I heard putting the CJ Smoothing Lotion on top helps but it has glycerin so I can&#x27;t try it out until March or April here in NY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it smells great, and curls up your hair nicely! But it just leaves crunch... for me. Lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a week and I&#x27;m in love! This makes my curls shiny, bouncy and clump nicely. It smells delicious and I will forever repurchase this product! This is what my hair needed. I use this and top of my curls with just a lil bit of mop top anti frizz gel and I&#x27;m good to go! Lovely frizz free, bouncy curls. :-) btw I have long hair to my lower back and 3a/3b curls. So glad my husband talked me into ordering this, I was hesitant and he said \\&quot;just get it\\&quot; so I did! Lol</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this stuff. We use it as a styling serum (after a lot of leave in as she has thick curly hair that&#x27;s very dry) and as a second, third, and fourth day \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; to smooth out frizzies and get her hair to behave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasing and the consistency is like liquidy gel. You don&#x27;t need a ton but if you&#x27;re using it while your hair is wet make sure you use enough. For dry second and beyond day hair you need only 2 quarters worth for mid back length hair. This does not give you the hard crunch that gels normally do and once you scrunch it a bit your hair is soft and frizz free - Super!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended to curly heads all over! It has water soluble silicones in it so you don&#x27;t need harsh detergent shampoo&#x27;s to get it out. We also did not find any build up problems or flaking problems like you can get with gel. Recommended!</li>
    <li> You will pay for Curl Junkie but in my case I get results. It pays for itself with the shine and definition I get from it. It&#x27;s also a great frizz buster. This is another CJ product that I keep as a staple. I have 4a, 4b hair.</li>
    <li> This product has light hold which is perfect for me.  It scrunches out easily and controls the frizz.  I don&#x27;t think I would be without it.</li>
    <li> For my hair type (fine, wavy/curly 2B/C), this stuff is amazing and gives me consistent but not producty curls. It may get crunchy when it dries but that scrunches out with little effort. More is not better IMO; a little is all you really need. For me, it&#x27;s best to put in after a bit of leave-in conditioner and while still quite damp though not soaking wet. Reactivates nicely after spritzed with water for second day (sometimes add a little more then). Can even get day 3! If you need a lot of control, this might not be it, but it&#x27;s the best moderate control product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I wish I had loved this product,  but unfortunately I did not even like it.  It made my hair feel sticky and did not take care of the frizz;(</li>
    <li> I try tons of natural hair products, but this is one that will remain in my lineup. I use it on top of the gel that I use each day.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewer, it&#x27;s okay.  It gave me a little curl definition, but not as much as Eco-Styler.  Definitely not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, long hair and I wanted to try a silicone free styling product. This stuff smells wonderful! It does help to give me control and define my curls &amp; waves, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for frizz on me. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair any curlier. I&#x27;m definitely going to use it up, but I won&#x27;t buy it again because I can find products that do the same thing or better at a cheaper price. If I ever go completely \\&quot;CG\\&quot; then I probably WOULD keep buying this because it does a decent job and doesn&#x27;t contain silicones.</li>
    <li> Just what my curls needed... I have very fine, naturally curly long hair that had become more wavy than curly over the past few years. I have had no luck finding any product to help my hair curl until this one! The best part is that it it seems to leave no build-up or residue and is not the least bit sticky or crunchy.  I use this on wet hair then blow-dry.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to like this product after seeing all the great reviews on here and on Youtube.  I&#x27;d finally found my method with Kinky Curly, but decided to try it anyways.  I also purchased the Smoothing Lotion and the Curl Rehab Moisturizing treatment to go with it.  Although it gave me nicely formed curls, I was not impressed with the hold and frizz control.  It wasn&#x27;t BAD, but could not compare to the Kinky Curly.  I used the exact same method that I use for applying my Kinky Curly gel and just did not get the same great results.  I read that some people use it as a finishing product.  For $18, it&#x27;s just not worth it when I get the Kinky Curly for $16.99 at Target and I don&#x27;t need a finisher.  For someone with less frizz, it may work better, but I&#x27;ll still with my KC.  I did like the Curl Rehab and the Smoothing lotion.  Both left my hair feeling very soft.  Going to try them with the KC to see if I get even better results.</li>
    <li> I have 3B curly hair and decided to try this after reading some very positive reviews. I have tried Diva curl and Ouidad lines as well as many products that are available at my local drug store, so I have a lot to compare this with. This product seemed watered down and so ineffective that I am going to dispose of the entire bottle after several uses. It didn&#x27;t hold my curl or deter frizz at all. I am sorry I wasted $20 on it. Diva and Ouidad outperform this by a mile for the same price, as do cheaper drug store brands. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but I&#x27;ve given it 3 stars because I think it will work better with longer hair. It really doesn&#x27;t define my short curls much but leaves it all crunch less and soft when dry.</li>
    <li> I have fine very curly hair but a lot of it. It often gets frizzy. I was so excited to get this after reading good reviews but was very disappointed. It makes my curls very stiff. I&#x27;ve used it numerous times thinking maybe I just used too much. But, even the smallest amount makes hair scrunchie which I can&#x27;t stand. Now I have almost a full bottle going to waste. I just ordered the davine curl cream after hearing it&#x27;s awesome. I am very disappointed with the way this makes my hair look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and am always on the lookout for products to help me control the frizz. This does the trick. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and with it being winter - and all the heaters being on - I have yet to frizz up. So, why the 4 stars instead of 5? Well, that is because this product makes my hair crunchy and I honestly don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;hair sprayed&amp;#34; feel. It is a fair trade off but, it does knock it down a star for me.</li>
    <li> did okay in my hair, but not what I expected. too thin of a product-was hoping it was a different consistency.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better products I&#x27;ve used to create curls, but I will say this-- it looks better the second day. Takes a long time to dry, not to mention taking a lot of product to make a dent in even my fine hair, but if you can sleep on it, you wake up look curltastic!</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair (for reference, I am 3A/3B with fine hair) and want a styling product that defines, gives light but non-crunchy hold, and reduces frizz, there is nothing better than Curl Junkie&#x27;s Curls in a Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thin gel that is easy to apply. I usually use a very small amount of a Curl Junkie leave-in conditioner first. Then I section my hair and apply a small amount of Curls in a Bottle to each section. I then use the &amp;#34;rake and shake&amp;#34; method in which you rake the product through the section of hair from root to end and then hold it out and give it a shake so that the definition begins. After the sections are done, I scrunch really well with a microfiber towel. You can view this method online or certainly use whatever method works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then air-dry my hair, not touching it until it is totally dry. Then I use my hands to scrunch again and separate the curls. My hair is now well-defined (spirals for me) with a minimum of frizz (I don&#x27;t believe claims of NO frizz at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can go three days without shampooing when using this styler, sometimes refreshing with a few spritzes of water and maybe a little dollop of Coffee-Coco Curl Creme - Lite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without this product!</li>
    <li> Great packaging! No leaks or spills!</li>
    <li> This not only smells wonderful, it WORKS wonderfully. I had used many curl defining/enhancing products, including highly-rated, good ones like Curl Keepper and Rocking Curls/Confident Coils by Jessicurl. This knocks them out of the curly-girl water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves NO funny smell (Curl Keeper smells like old lipstick and JC has unfortunate scents in her line). Leaves no unappealing crunch. It just gives curls a nice definition. I found it helped my curls clump and stay formed, though they were more relaxed than with  Curl Keeper and JC. I&#x27;m fine with a less coiled up (shortened) curl as long as it stays smooth, soft, clumped and defined. I get that with this--along with a lovely scent. I also have the confidence that the CJ line gives me a lot of high quality products, and mostly natural, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I used it with a bit of ArcAngel (as I always use some gel with any curl definer/enhancer). I&#x27;ve heard from some gals that they can use this without gel. I might experiment and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I have pretty third-day hair, and I didn&#x27;t do anything other than shake out and finger comb my hair (to remove loose hairs from sleeping). No rewetting. No skip-curling. No scrunching. I do have some frizz (I always frizz badly by second day, it&#x27;s my lot in life), but much less than with any other line of products. CIAB has kept my curls curly and Curl Rehab kept them moist. I love the Curl Junkie line. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m new to this line, but this is the best \\&quot;curly hair\\&quot; and Curly Girl Method friendly product line I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I&#x27;ve used DEVA, Jessicurl, MyHoneyChild, Curly Hair Solutions, Jane Carter Solutions, and Mop Top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I have really curly natural hair.  My hair gets really frizzy, and is hard to manage.  This stuff tames my hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my hair and it keeps my curls in shape after shampoo  and conditioning, but not too long.</li>
    <li> This is the best curly hair product i have ever used! ( and I&#x27;ve used a lot!) When i use this product i put it in my hair while I&#x27;m still in the shower and my hair is pretty wet I then end my shower, blot my hair, let air dry and GO! Its the only hair product that i have to use now, its just that awesome. I get nice ringlet curls without frizz and fly aways! If you are a curly i would deff say its a MUST to try! :D</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It really defines my curls and keeps them soft.&lt;br /&gt;@;)  Second and third-day-curls look great too ! !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.C  in  Louisiana</li>
    <li> After hearing so much about Curls in a Bottle on Youtube, even though I was sceptical I bought this product about a month ago.  When the bottle arrived I put it on the shelf and didn&#x27;t use it.  Then the other day it rained and my hair was all frizzed out and looking a mess.  I decided to give this stuff a chance.  I really must say that this is THE best hair product to control frizz that I have used.  Since for me gel tends to be too heavy so I used it without a gel and I got absolutely no crunch.  I got great shine and beautiful ringlets.  It smells light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it for naturally curly/coily hair.  It is now in my holy grail of hair product must haves.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B0046HIP1Y Curl Junkie Curl Assurance Smoothing Lotion, 12 fl. oz.]]. The smoothing lotion is amazing and by far THE BEST detangler I have ever used but it doesn&#x27;t smell so good. I use this curls in bottle stuff on top of it as a styler and it smells great. It&#x27;s not like an overpowering smell but like a light berry kind of scent. I have type 3b/3c hair and this stuff holds my hair all day in the summer with humidity and all and is good for second day hair without too much day 2 work. I can&#x27;t quite explain the consistency but I guess it&#x27;s close to like a diluted or runnier version of veggie glycerin. Awesome product! I will use it forever!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd time ordering this and I still love it. Works great on curly hair. Highly reccomended. Adds shine and definition to my curls.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff for natural hair!  It worked well in bringing out the curls in my hair.  Try it! You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> fixes any bad hair day in seconds. absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> Works great, dries a little stiff at first but if you just scrunch your hair after it dries you lose that stiffness or crunch and your curls look soft like you didn&#x27;t use any product. it also holds up really well in all kinds of weather, humidity etc. and for more than 1 day. I have naturally curly hair and have tried many products, the curl junkie products are by far my favorite. So far I have tried 4 different curl junkie products and have LOVED 3 of them, the  4th was just okay. Oh, and they all smell wonderful which is equally important.</li>
    <li> I have type 3a hair and it gets very frizzy. This did nothing for my hair.  It made my hair more frizzy, it added no shine, and made my hair feel rough and tangled. Very disappointed. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have 3B afro-asian hair, according to the naturallycurly dotcom website. I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy and it controls the curls. Second day hair is pretty good, but not great. I like the consistency and smell, too. I typically wash my hair with regular shampoo 2 or 3 times a week. I usually don&#x27;t use rinse-out conditioner, and opt for a leave-in. I really like Curl Junkie Assurance Smoothing Lotion. I have used tons of curl products: Ouidad, AG recoil, kinky curls and many more. They are all pretty good at controlling my hair in their own way.</li>
    <li> The best stuff out there for girls with curls. My daughter has tried THEM ALL!</li>
    <li> I use this with the cleansing conditioner... makes my curls a little more profound when using my diffuser.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> Works great on day one but on day two it gives your hair a little bit of a funny texture.</li>
    <li> Curly hair requires products.  Curl Junkie Curls in a Bottle works well on wet hair by itself or mixed with another styling gel.</li>
    <li> product. I heard such good things so when I saw a deal on Curl Mart-I jumped at the chance to try it. It wets the hair really well, but not much curl definition for me. I am still going to try some of their other products, hoping for better results</li>
    <li> This hair solution is amazing!  It definitely gave my hair more curl and made my hair shiny and soft.  I need to use other product for frizz control and definition, but I just wanted a hair product that gave my curls more life.  I have type 2B hair and I wash it at night and put the solution in before bed.</li>
    <li> I was in a hot and dry location and this worked wonders. I really liked it mixed with natural hair oils I had purchased, like sweet almond.  Don&#x27;t need a lot to get nice curls.</li>
    <li> It defined most of my curls but I still had some frizz &amp; my hair was hard/stiff when it dried.</li>
    <li> This product is super amazing. It really makes your curls pop with ease. This product is on my HG list my hair can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product like this for a long time!! It leaves your curls soft and non-frizzy ! Love!!</li>
    <li> Lightweight and soft to the touch! Does what it says it does. I&#x27;ve used a lot of products. I like this one..</li>
    <li> Works amazing!! Great product;) fast shipping. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> The jury&#x27;s still out on this one. I want to like it...I spent $22 on the bottle.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and will continue to use it, but I&#x27;m not blown away.  I&#x27;m still looking for a product that&#x27;s going to do that for me.</li>
    <li> May be great for someone with thick, crazy, out of control hair... but I found this stuff way too light weight and didn&#x27;t do crap!</li>
    <li> its lose thin gel almost the consistency of water. it doesn&#x27;t flake wich is  a PLUS, i didnt get hard and held perfectly will order more in the future i love it</li>
