<li> so I will stick with my special secret serum until then.  </li>
<li> It is tight but natural.  </li>
<li> Lately hard to find where we shop, so buy it on line when we find it at a reasonable price.</li>
<li> It works immediately, my makeup goes on well after providing a couple of seconds for the product to dry, and it lasts all day.  </li>
<li> So i&#x27;ll continue to buy it but only on Amazon for less than half!</li>
<li> Save your money, not worth the curiosity.</li>
<li> However, the hype regarding it&#x27;s effectiveness in 5 minutes or even 15 is not remotely true.  </li>
<li> A small amount</li>
<li> I was not able to try the product.</li>
<li> Too bad they&#x27;ve raised the price on it at Walgreens</li>

    <li> Actual results.  It mattifies the skin for makeup application but it&#x27;s best feature is the fact that it actually does lift the face.  And with continued use, it stays lifted.  Too bad they&#x27;ve raised the price on it at Walgreens (it&#x27;s now almost $40)!  So i&#x27;ll continue to buy it but only on Amazon for less than half!</li>
    <li> I was not able to try the product. The pump on the product was defective, the vendor did not replace the product. This item was not expensive but the principal of this vendors attitude left me stunned. I would still like to try this product and will purchase from another vendor.</li>
    <li> It works....but you must apply as directed every day and night.  A small amount and my dermatologist said you must massage in until absorbed.  For the price it is great and I have worked in cosmetics at dept stores and used the supposedly BEST!!&lt;br /&gt;I really know it works for me because when I run out my face knows it.  Also in the morning, my husband tells me my face is beautiful.  It is tight but natural.  I am 62, still have not had my facelift so I will stick with my special secret serum until then.  You just have to keep using , Dont stop.....skin gets use to it.  Go by directions a d you also will wake up with a fresh tight healthy skin.  Also use under makeup.</li>
    <li> Outer box damaged but product was ok. No mention made of box damage prior to sale, which would have been nice..</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years mostly on my neck.  It seems to tighten up my neck better than most other products.</li>
    <li> I suppose if I use it for 2 or 3 years I may see some results.  However, the hype regarding it&#x27;s effectiveness in 5 minutes or even 15 is not remotely true.  However, all are not created equal so maybe it depends on the skin type.  Save your money, not worth the curiosity.</li>
    <li> Unlike so many products that claim to lift, you can actually feel the tightening of the facial skin.  I love it and hope it will continue to be produced.</li>
    <li> Really like this product !</li>
    <li> RIP OFF ALERT - Product does not do any of the things it says in the description.  And then Amazon sellers won&#x27;t let you return, so my advice is not to buy this product unless you go to a reputable store that will refund after you find out everything it states is an out and out lie and it doesn&#x27;t do a thing for you.</li>
    <li> love it. works,but takes time.</li>
    <li> I know that some people have provided negative reviews on this product, but I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it.  It works immediately, my makeup goes on well after providing a couple of seconds for the product to dry, and it lasts all day.  It also stops my eyeliner from running, even after a 10 hour work day.</li>
    <li> You do feel the tightness but I really don&#x27;t see much. Perhaps it takes awhile</li>
    <li> All was well when received. Used this for years and love the product. Yes, I can tell the difference when I skip a day. Product came fast as promised.</li>
    <li> No change with product use.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for quite a while and she loves it. Lately hard to find where we shop, so buy it on line when we find it at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The two bottles were different which led me to believe that one was an old batch. It did come in a timely manner.</li>
