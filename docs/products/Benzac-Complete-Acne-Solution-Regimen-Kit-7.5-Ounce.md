### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
      <li>cleanser is probably the best product.</li>
      <li>PERFECT SCENT PROFILE:</li>
      <li>My daughter has been using this product for about a month and her skin has greatly improved!</li>
      <li>This has been a very pleasant surprise because of its description as an acne solution.</li>
      <li>The product is very good quality.</li>
      <li>Again she&#x27;s not the ideal test case</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a very nice smell and we&#x27;re very happy!</li>
      <li>The Benzac system seemed like it&#x27;d be perfectly placed for a try, and the results are fairly good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m happy with the lighter/gentler exfoliatory effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff works great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is great to see my son&#x27;s face clearing up</li>
      <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have an outbreak, it&#x27;s a great cleaning system and she started using it nightly.  </li>
      <li>My skin is happy after use.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a great skin cleaner</li>
      <li>The facewash is great, I use it with an electric spin brush.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is great after washing my face as well.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness.</li>
      <li>The foam is very nice and rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used it for 2 months and seen AMAZING results!</li>
      <li>It works beautifully! :)</li>
      <li>Since benzoyl peroxide is NOT an ingredient, I decided I&#x27;d give it a fair try.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this, though I would like to see the option of having a bit more than 0.5% salicylic acid in the cleanser.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s working better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before, including Proactive!</li>
      <li>The line touts sandalwood as a prime ingredient (while salicylic acid is much higher up on the list of ingredients), but this cleanser has a wonderful orange scent.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see more results!</li>
      <li>I now have the beautiful and smooth complexion of my youth.</li>
      <li>The Benzac system has a pleasant, herbal scent that smells great going on your body but quickly fades.</li>
      <li>We used the three step process on all three areas and have had amazing results.</li>
      <li>This product works amazing.</li>
      <li>Amazing product.  </li>
      <li>It took me around a week for results, but the results were amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;+First impressions, I liked the foaming cleanser.</li>
      <li>The exfoliation benefits are really the best part of using a product with salicylic acid.</li>
      <li>so you can make your own decision about them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cleanser is just 0.5% and you&#x27;re washing most of it off with water, but it&#x27;s better than nothing!</li>
      <li>I know that some oils are healthy for your face, but not this kind.</li>
      <li>The hydrator is nice too, as most acne solutions don&#x27;t include any moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Of course, there are many reasons why people have acne, but in the case of of a family member who tested this product, it proved effective.</li>
      <li>This product worked great at first.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have nearly as many breakouts.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many multi-step systems and I dislike it when one or two bottles run out way before the other(s).</li>
      <li>and I suspected it might be this system, although I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
      <li>I have gotten much better results with Proactive.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>especially liked the foaming cleanser and one pump is more than enough to cleanse a face.</li>
      <li>Personally, I think this is a great regimen to try!</li>
      <li>I was expecting a lot better for the price.</li>
      <li>Both the spot treatment and the mositurizer have a much more potent sandalwood scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a worthwhile product to consider for getting acne-troubled skin under control.</li>
      <li>and she said &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My daughter is cautious, but pleased with the result.</li>
      <li>I love the foam wash because it encourages my son to use it.</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s used products with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid before, but commented that Benzac foaming cleanser contains .5% salicylic acid when most of her products have contained 1% - 2%.</li>
      <li>I am sure this works for some better than others, since there are many things that contribute to the appearance of your skin.</li>
      <li>No redness or peeling, just a nice smooth canvas.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not outrageous.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried alot of different products but this has worked the best.</li>
      <li>I am severely allergic to benzoyl peroxide, which is in most three-step acne systems, so I haven&#x27;t been able to use them.</li>
      <li>The Benzac Acne Regimen, like most acne products, is not something that will automatically make breakouts vanish overnight.</li>
      <li>list goes on, but those are the things I can remember off the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, as most of us have discovered, there is no one-size-fits-all cure in the acne business, and if this doesn&#x27;t work for you, there are still 1299 products to try.</li>
      <li>hope this will be helpful for someone :)</li>
      <li>but Galderma Benzac Acne Solutions includes many supportive ingredients what help exfoliate, removes excess oil, soothes and hydrates skin.</li>
      <li>Benzac&#x27;s YouTube video helped us understand better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although these products include some interesting and worthwhile ingredients that are getting a lot of publicity (how else to differentiate yourself from those 1300 competitors?)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll also add that it pills up when applying makeup over top of it.</li>
      <li>Best to cover your bases, and prevent your skin from blowing up with masses of oil production, because you&#x27;re too dry.</li>
      <li>Great product on sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>The Benzac Complete Acne Solution Regimen Kit has been great for my face.</li>
      <li>I love that the lotion aspect goes on lightly and leaves my skin feeling</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and has good results.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t much in the bottle; it would be nice to get more of that in the kit.</li>
      <li>The Intensive Spot Treatment - kind of the line&#x27;s clearasil potion - dries blemishes much the way most products of this type do.</li>
      <li>My problems are that the cleansers fragrance is too strong and that the spot treatment burns when you apply it.</li>
      <li>I noticed the light woodsy smell and the nice texture of the foaming wash right away.</li>
      <li>The foaming cleanser and lotion were fine.</li>
      <li>The Foaming Cleanser is easy to apply and will leave your skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>Which is great for anyone who isn&#x27;t hypersensitive to salicylic acid, as its efficacy has been indicated in various research studies I&#x27;ve read.</li>
      <li>I really think that the sandalwood oil combined with the salicylic acid is what makes this system so effective.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m having good results with this system.</li>
      <li>The cleanser did successfully remove my makeup, and quite easily it seems, although I did not use it around my eyes for obvious reasons.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, a very good product and competitively priced with other brands she&#x27;s used.</li>
      <li>Works great better then other items I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>This was sent to me as a member of the Vine review team, but it is something that I would gladly spend my own money on, as it seems not only effective, but gentle!</li>
      <li>This kit works quickly from the start and the kit is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>If you have a child with mild to moderate acne, this may be a great product for them to try.</li>
      <li>This is completely worth it!</li>
      <li>Sandalwood oil makes this kit unique from any of the others I&#x27;ve tried over the years (ProActiv, Clearasil, prescription creams and gels, etc.).</li>
      <li>The last step is the moisturizer, which both feels and smells pleasant on your skin.</li>
      <li>I think the salicylic acid content in the cleanser could have been a bit higher but 0.5% is okay as a mild cleanser.</li>
      <li>Since she started, she has been really pleased and even though we got the original package through Vines, she&#x27;s asked that we continue to purchase it as she really likes it.  </li>
      <li>My son has been using this product for about two weeks now and we have not seen a significant change in his skin condition (mild acne).</li>
      <li>For teens or people with more pronounced acne problems, I really can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy</li>
      <li>It uses a foaming pump to make it foam, the actual cleanser is not detergenty or sudsy, which is good as soaps tend to aggravate acne.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s pretty easy for her to abstain from going to quick/easy route and just popping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>foaming wash smells really good, kind of a sour smell, and it makes your skin feel really fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used it twice and I am 21 years old. I can already tell a difference in my skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel like regular face wash becuase it doesn&#x27;t have that feel when you use the face wash. The second product does give that feel at a slightly less sensation. My face did get a little red after use and itches a little but I have pretty sensitive skin. I am actually not wearing any foundation today and you can still see my acne a little but not as bad as two days ago. The third product has a wear roughage same, similar to hay, but its not going to take away from the product for me. Hopefullly my skin will be completely clear in a few weeks. I will update through out the first month as long as I remember.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 and used this program as directed every single day for almost two months and it did absolutely nothing for my skin. The spot treatment (step 2) is a rip off in that when you first open it it is 70% empty and you have to squeeze half the tube flat before you even get any product... mostly this just left my skin feeling dry and did nothing for my acne. Smells good but other than that would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s going through a minor acne phase, and of course, it&#x27;s a huge issue with her. The Benzac system seemed like it&#x27;d be perfectly placed for a try, and the results are fairly good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is probably the best product. The line touts sandalwood as a prime ingredient (while salicylic acid is much higher up on the list of ingredients), but this cleanser has a wonderful orange scent. I was tempted to try it myself! It cleans gently and leaves the skin sweet without stripping it. The Intensive Spot Treatment - kind of the line&#x27;s clearasil potion - dries blemishes much the way most products of this type do. Both the spot treatment and the mositurizer have a much more potent sandalwood scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, it&#x27;s a good, solid regimen for calming and clearing the skin without too much drying effect. My daughter is cautious, but pleased with the result. The price, too, is reasonable for an entire three part system. She&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> My 19 year old son used this product for a while and noticed little, if any change at all. He stated there was a burn, but he dubbed it a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; burn. He used it daily and we were both disappointed that it didn&#x27;t clear up the acne on his cheeks. No complaints on other fronts (scent, ease of use, packaging, etc.), but needless to say, we&#x27;ll be seeking other options. Shame, but I guess no product has 100% efficacy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 38 and have tried everything for acne. I finally found something that works. I went from having constant breakouts to a clear face. Even the black heads in my nose have reduced in size and are clearing up. Also love that this product doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I have persistent adult acne (meaning I&#x27;ve had acne since I was a teenager, and am now in my 30&#x27;s). I&#x27;ve gotten it mostly under control by supplementing with zinc and also a pretty complicated system of cleansing and treating. I actually make my own cold cream using evening primrose oil, sulfur and tea tree oil, then tone with witchhazel and spot treat with 10% ichthammol ointment when needed. Although my system works, if I could have something easier, especially when traveling, that would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read online about this Benzac system before ordering. I read a press release online where the company described the product as &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. This appealed to me, and I liked that the product uses essential oils  and no benzoyl peroxide (I hate that stuff). When the box arrived, I was dissappointed to read the ingredient list, it has glycols and parabens in it, which I wouldn&#x27;t consider &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. And although it doesn&#x27;t contain any animal derived ingredients (as far as I can tell), the company does test on animals, so that&#x27;s not exactly &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; either. Although I would never order this product again for these reasons, since I had it, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+First impressions, I liked the foaming cleanser. It uses a foaming pump to make it foam, the actual cleanser is not detergenty or sudsy, which is good as soaps tend to aggravate acne. The cleanser did successfully remove my makeup, and quite easily it seems, although I did not use it around my eyes for obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;+The moisturizer that comes with it has no SPF in it, which is a no-no for me, I will not use a moisturizer during the day with no SPF. I&#x27;ve been using Murad Anti-Aging Moisturizer for blemish-prone skin SPF 20. But I figured I&#x27;d just use the Benzac Moisturizer at night so as not to waste it.&lt;br /&gt;+When I first used the spot treatment, I was surprised to squeeze the tube and find that it&#x27;s half empty, then when you finally got some product out, it comes rushing out as the opening is too big. I&#x27;ll also add that it pills up when applying makeup over top of it. Not a huge fan of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I used this system for about a week and then had to stop because it was drying out my skin so bad. The only thing worse then having a pimple is having a pimple and horribly dry skin. Also, every time I&#x27;d use any of the products, my eyes would sting even though I didn&#x27;t apply near my eyes. I think from the salicylic acid fumes or something. I&#x27;ll speak for all adult women when I say we aren&#x27;t fans of dried out skin and moisturizers without SPF in them. I also started to break out a little and I suspected it might be this system, although I can&#x27;t say for sure. I&#x27;m posting the product ingredients below so you can make your own decision about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients Skin Balancing Foaming Cleanser: alcohol denatured, backhousia citriodora leaf extract, butylene glycol, caprylic/capric triglyceride, citric acid, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) peel oil, citrus grandis (grapefruit) peel oil, citrus reticulate (tangerine) peel oil, glycerin, glycine soja (soybean) oil,lauramidopropyl betaine, lonicera caprifolium (honeysuckle) flower extract, lonicera japonica (honeysuckle) flower extract, phenoxyethanol, polysorbate 80, potassium benzoate, santalum album (sandalwood) oil, sodium laurylglcosides hydroxypropylsulfonate, terminalia ferdinandiana fruit extract, tocopherol, water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients Intensive Spot Treatment: alcohol, allium fistulosum bulb extract, backhousia citriodora leaf extract, butylene glycol, butylparaben, cardiospermum halicacabum flower/leaf/vine extract, citric acid, echium plantagineum seed oil, ethylparaben, hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) water, helianthus annus (sunflower) seed oil unsaponifiables, hydroxypropylcellulose, isobutylparaben, methylparaben, octyldodecanol, phenoxyethanol, potassium benzoate, potassium sorbate, propylparaben, santalum album (sandalwood) oil, SD Alcohol 40-B, tocopherol, water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients Blemish Clearning Hydrator: alcohol denatured, backhousia citriodora leaf extract, butyl avocadate, butlene glycol, c13-14 isoparaffin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, chlorphenesin, citric acid, glycerin, hydrolyzed algin, isodecyl neopentanoate, laureth-7, lonicera caprifolium (honeysuckle) flower extract, lonicera japonica (honeysuckle) flower extract, methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamine, potassium benzoate, potassium sorbate, proplyene glycol, santalum album (sandalwood) oil, terminalia ferdinandiana fruit extract, water, zinc sulfate.wood) oil, SD Alcohol 40-B, tocopherol, water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients Blemish Clearning Hydrator: alcohol denatured, backhousia citriodora leaf extract, butyl avocadate, butlene glycol, c13-14 isoparaffin, caprylic/capric triglyceride, chlorphenesin, citric acid, glycerin, hydrolyzed algin, isodecyl neopentanoate, laureth-7, lonicera caprifolium (honeysuckle) flower extract, lonicera japonica (honeysuckle) flower extract, methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, polyacrylamine, potassium benzoate, potassium sorbate, proplyene glycol, santalum album (sandalwood) oil, terminalia ferdinandiana fruit extract, water, zinc sulfate.</li>
    <li> I have 2 teenagers who are starting to show their years. This Benzac Complete Acne Solution Regimen is our first line of defense against the scourge of acne. It seems to be working very well so far. It is a 3 step treatment with a cleanser, spot treatment and hydrator. The spot treatment works very well and my kids seem to like it. So far so good.</li>
    <li> System works well. I&#x27;d say it is on par with the many 3 step Salicylic Acid systems you can purchase locally or online. I especially like the Foaming Cleanser. It is very mild and cleans very well.     I only have two complaints. There isn&#x27;t enough of the Hydrator (Only 1-oz.) included and you will absolutely smell the Sandalwood; it is quite strong.    My preference is still the [[ASIN:B000EPA4FW Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System]]. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat and it includes a Salicylic Acid polish and an 8-oz. Benzoyl Peroxide Lotion.</li>
    <li> After use of Benzac Step 1, foaming cleanser, my 17 year old son&#x27;s face began clearing up after two uses. Three weeks llater it continues to heal with no new blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing to other products: My son had been on a break using only handmade cold process soap on his face after a bad experience with daily antibiotics and prescription Epiduo gel spot treatment (adapalene and benzoyl peroxide active ingredients). The Epiduo was overly drying to the point of causing pain and cracked skin. It also bleached out his face towel, bath towel, pillowcase, and shirt collars. Daily use of oral antibiotics killed his healthy gut bacteria, created a yeast overgrowth (candida) and caused leaky gut with development of new food intolerances (allergies). He also tried X Out multi step kit but that had a brutal face freezing sensation of a burn then a chilling cold sensation that was not tolerable. X Out also dried up my son&#x27;s face causing flaking and peeling skin  (and my face also) to the point where it was not able to be tolerated. We both had tried X Out due to a 50+ year old friend&#x27;s recommendation for herself and her two teen girls, claiming it helped her hormone related pimple breakouts (from puberty and pre-menopause). My second, younger son also could not tolerate the freezing action on the face of X Out. But a major problem with X Out is it is a monthly subscription by mail plan and nearly impossible to cancel out of the automatic billing to the credit card. Also buying their entire kit by subscription gave us a ton of extra product we were not using up fast enough. I only got out when our credit card number was closed out due to identity theft! A good thing about Benzac is you can start with the kit and can buy each item individually if you use them at different rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions on the Benzac kit box with steps 1-3 were confusing. Benzac&#x27;s YouTube video helped us understand better. My teen did not realize he did not understand the written directions but for the sake of the review (and for his success with the treatment plan) I wanted to be sure he was using the steps correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: foaming cleanser for the whole face (active ingredient salicytic acid). We detect orange scent as dominant, it does contain orange peel oil and tangerine oil. The sandalwood scent is not strong. Directions state if once a day use of this dries the face out too much to use it every other day. There is a little tingle but it is not causing a hot burning sensation or a cold freezing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Intensive Spot Treatment (active ingredient salicytic acid) is to be put on areas of blemishes and to \\&quot;cover the affected area\\&quot;. The gray area is it is supposed to prevent future blemishes that are supposedly forming underneath the skin for weeks or months before they appear on the surface, so apparently this is for the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Blemish Clearing Hydrator (active ingredient salicytic acid) is basically a daily facial lotion such as what adult women typically use. This is to combat any drying that may be occurring due to use of products in step 1 and step 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the high cost of prescription drug spot blemish gels this is a very low cost product. Also products sold at dermatologist&#x27;s offices are much more expensive. For example the cost of one Benzac 3 step kit is less than one co-pay for prescription spot treatment (dab only on the pimple). It also saves a family money by not having to visit the dermatologist and pay co-payments for office visits just to get refills of skin cleaners and spot treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great to see my son&#x27;s face clearing up and no new blemishes have appeared since he began using the cleanser a week ago. He is less compliant with using steps 2 and 3 every day. I took before photos so I could be sure to remember the starting situation correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this 5 stars for its effectiveness in just one week and for its low price compared to other over the counter treatment kits and compared to prescription drugs and because you can buy each piece separately if you wish.rescription drugs and because you can buy each piece separately if you wish.</li>
    <li> this was a waste of money. It made absolutely no difference. Definitely will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my teen age daughter to try. After two weeks, she concluded that this worked as well (but not better) than the perscription cream she got from her doctor. However, the three step regimine was annoying and time consuming, and the atringent product burned her skin. So, basically, she said its not worth the time since the perscription cream works just as well. And, from a cost perspecctive, I can get a tube from the pharmacy for a $5 co-pay that lasts six months. This is far more expensive.</li>
    <li> Galderma,the big pharma company that focuses on dermatology, jumped into the acne-treatment maelstrom with a splashy introduction of this three-phase treatment product. With an estimated 1300 over-the-counter remedies crowding drugstore shelves already,it&#x27;s hard to capture consumer awareness. Because an estimated 100 million people suffer from acne -- many of us well beyond our teen years -- Galderma evidently decided it was worth competing with itself (its prescription-only products include Differin, Epiduo, and Eryacne, and it&#x27;s also known for other OTC Benzac products) for more of that OTC market share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although these products include some interesting and worthwhile ingredients that are getting a lot of publicity (how else to differentiate yourself from those 1300 competitors?) the active ingredient in all three kit components is salicylic acid. Which is great for anyone who isn&#x27;t hypersensitive to salicylic acid, as its efficacy has been indicated in various research studies I&#x27;ve read. Salicylic acid is also widely used for facial peels, so if you are one of the unfortunate sufferers dealing with acne and aging, you&#x27;ll appreciate the double whammy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the salicylic acid, the products include kakadu plum, which has a high concentration of vitamin C (skin brightener! antioxidant!), honeysuckle (anti-inflammatory), and sandalwood oil, an anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial ingredient which has the attributes of tea tree oil without the nasty smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s vegan, not tested on animals, with recyclable packaging and sustainably sourced ingredients. Props to Galderma for hitting all the high points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Galderma says that over 90% of people suffering from mild to moderate acne will see improvement in two weeks, with optimal results after eight weeks. Since I&#x27;m required to review this product after 30 days, I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term effects, but this is a solution worth investigating. Unfortunately, as most of us have discovered, there is no one-size-fits-all cure in the acne business, and if this doesn&#x27;t work for you, there are still 1299 products to try.</li>
    <li> STOP WASTING YOUR MONEY ON OTHER ACNE THREE-STEP PRODUCTS!! I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s working better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before, including Proactive! We all know how expensive acne washes &amp; 3-step kits can get over the years of buying and nothing ever working.... This is completely worth it! The only complaint I have is about the spot treatment. Which could have a little more in it for the refill price of about $14, which I&#x27;ve replaced twice within the month. Other than that,  I would deffinitly recommend to and for anyone struggling with acne! It works beautifully! :)</li>
    <li> I had to wait to get some feedback on this b/c my daughter was the main user.  She doesn&#x27;t really have an acne problem but has occasional outbreaks just like most people do here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to really review it, you need to compare it to other competing products. Compared to an Oxy pad or simple face wash, it&#x27;s a little more complex. it&#x27;s a system that and it&#x27;s intended to be used in a specific fashion.  That entails reading the instructions which you can do in about 5 minutes.  Every teenager is admonished not to &#x27;pop&#x27; their &#x27;zits&#x27; b/c of scarring but I think every teenager does.  B/c our daughter doesn&#x27;t really have an acne problem, it&#x27;s pretty easy for her to abstain from going to quick/easy route and just popping them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we asked her dermatologist about Benzac, he said he had two other patients that used it and he had a favorable impression about it.  Again she&#x27;s not the ideal test case just b/c she just has minor occasional outbreaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it cleans well without drying out the skin (a big concern of hers).  Even if you don&#x27;t have an outbreak, it&#x27;s a great cleaning system and she started using it nightly.  Since she started, she has been really pleased and even though we got the original package through Vines, she&#x27;s asked that we continue to purchase it as she really likes it.  She&#x27;s also let a few of her friends use it when they&#x27;ve had sleep overs and all of them started using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked her for details to write the review and she said &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; and the fact she&#x27;s insistent on continue use pretty much says it all. For teens or people with more pronounced acne problems, I really can&#x27;t speak to its efficacy but it&#x27;s a great skin cleaner and I would have to think that it&#x27;s much better than simple alcohol only approaches that rely on alcohol to dry out the skin.</li>
    <li> As someone who has struggled with acne for years I&#x27;ve tried almost everything. So I decided I might as well try this. Even after the first use I noticed a difference in my skin. The acne spots weren&#x27;t as red and it wasn&#x27;t as painful. After a week I noticed it had started to clear up. By the end of about 3 weeks my face is noticeably clearer and I don&#x27;t have nearly as many breakouts. The only con about this product is that step 2 stings when putting it on open acne, and it does dry out your skin. But the dry skin is easily fixed with moisturizing after every time you complete all three steps. I love this product and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews but after washing my face and using the product 2 times, i got a bad chemical burn. I went to the minute clinic. The step 2 phase stings like hell. Do not buy this.</li>
    <li> I have adult onset acne and tried every single tip, trick and product out there. Nothing worked. NOTHING! Until Benzac. For the first time in 5 years, I don&#x27;t feel the need to hide the bumps and pimples because I have none. I now have the beautiful and smooth complexion of my youth. I did learn very quickly, though, it is not smart to skip days when you are first starting as my acne became significantly worse. Now, I&#x27;m all clear whether I skip a day or not.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne, and I am not sure this product did much for me.  I did not have any major breakouts (despite working out during usage) and I would say that my skin looks better, but I noticed that I still had a good number of blackheads and didn&#x27;t do much to address my skin&#x27;s redness (which is disappointing because the product claims that it is for &amp;#34;calming red, irritated skin&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is advertised as being &amp;#34;free of artificial fragrance &amp; dyes,&amp;#34; but the citrus fragrance of the the Skin Balancing Foam Cleanser is still pretty strong.  It didn&#x27;t bother my allergies, but just stronger than I would like.  This also made me feel like it was a morning wake-me up product, not a calming night-time (or all day) product.  Also, while I do like foam facial products, I personally prefer a product that gives a little tingle that tells me its working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Intensive Spot Treatment did seem to calm a sport that might have been flaring up (but I can&#x27;t say this is any better than the Clean &amp; Clear product that I&#x27;ve used for years that can be picked up by itself).  This product is advertised as being drying (and thus should be used sparingly at first); this is true of this type of products but, in my case, did not overly dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I didn&#x27;t mind using this product and I am glad for the small improvements I saw, but it&#x27;s not a product that I would choose to buy.  I expected more progress.  If I did buy anything, I&#x27;d be more likely to buy the Step 2 (Intensive Spot Treatment) separately.  (These products are sold separately on amazon.com).  However, products like the Clean &amp; Clear version I mentioned above have worked just as well for me (at about 1/3 of the cost).</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  My girls use the products daily and what a difference in only two weeks.  Sandalwood oil really clears pimples with its natural antibiotic healing power.</li>
    <li> This is no better than anything else on the market.</li>
    <li> My college-age daughter has been using this product on her mild acne for four days and really likes it. She loves the sandalwood/citrus scent of it, and the fact that just a small pump of the foam is enough to wash her whole face. She&#x27;s used products with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid before, but commented that Benzac foaming cleanser contains .5% salicylic acid when most of her products have contained 1% - 2%. It helps dry out and heal blemishes (even the ones that haven&#x27;t erupted yet) and soothe redness, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out her face the way stronger formulas do. I tried it on my own middle aged face, and thought it cleaned very well but left me parched and dry. Definitely a product for young, oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very good product and competitively priced with other brands she&#x27;s used.</li>
    <li> This is a worthwhile product to consider for getting acne-troubled skin under control. Of course, there are many reasons why people have acne, but in the case of of a family member who tested this product, it proved effective. It is not drying (peeling, flaking) and there was a gradual improvement visible. First the pimples lost their redness and after the second week, they were decreasing in size and number. This was sent to me as a member of the Vine review team, but it is something that I would gladly spend my own money on, as it seems not only effective, but gentle!</li>
    <li> Call it a bit vain but I find using a light salicylic acid product on my mature(ish) skin does wonders for the aging process, at least for me. I don&#x27;t have acne but I do have an occasional breakout. I find that using products with salicylic acid makes the turnaround time for a blemish to go away a fraction of what it could be left untreated. The exfoliation benefits are really the best part of using a product with salicylic acid. The face wash and the blemish clearing hydrator contains 0.5% salicylic acid, while the spot treatment contains 2%, which seems to be the standard dose. I think the salicylic acid content in the cleanser could have been a bit higher but 0.5% is okay as a mild cleanser. I guess this set of three products is meant to compete with the Proactiv brand. Although the name \\&quot;Benzac\\&quot; seems a bit too medicinal, in my opinion, and gives the impression that this is a benzoyl peroxide product, which it is not. And I think benzoyl peroxide is a bit harsher than salicylic acid so I&#x27;m happy with the lighter/gentler exfoliatory effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially liked the foaming cleanser and one pump is more than enough to cleanse a face. The sandalwood oil fragrance is lovely - not to strong or harsh, just fresh and clean. I am surprised that the sandalwood is not mentioned on the packaging. I think that would be a definite pro to getting people interested in the product as a higher end package and not just as a medicinally functional set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this, though I would like to see the option of having a bit more than 0.5% salicylic acid in the cleanser. My skin is happy after use. No redness or peeling, just a nice smooth canvas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seems just a bit high for what you get but it&#x27;s not outrageous.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my teenage daughter. She have your typical teenager hormonal acne. The first month the products appear to help, clearing some of the acne. However; by the end of the second  month her complexion is worse than it was before starting the product. Not sure what to do right now, continue with the products a little longer or just stop all together. On the plus side, it did not irritate her skin.</li>
    <li> I am 19 with very oily skin with moderate acne. I have been using this product for a week and a half and it has kept my breakouts under control. The acne isn&#x27;t completely gone but it is less noticable than in the past.  However, the main reason i am giving it such a bad review is because when i use all 3 steps, i cannot stand the smell. I understand that its the medicine but the smell of step 3 just makes me not want to use it at all. I will continue to use it because its working but i skip step three every once and awhile because i don&#x27;t want to smell bad.</li>
    <li> I have previously tried many other brands including Proactive. I was expecting a lot better for the price. It didnt do much of anything except make my acne worse. I have gotten much better results with Proactive. No impressive.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood oil makes this kit unique from any of the others I&#x27;ve tried over the years (ProActiv, Clearasil, prescription creams and gels, etc.). Apparently the sandalwood is proven to reduce inflammation and redness and help clear skin. I noticed the light woodsy smell and the nice texture of the foaming wash right away. It is not overdrying (a common problem with acne cleansers) and it left skin feeling clean and fresh, not tight and raw. The hydrator is nice too, as most acne solutions don&#x27;t include any moisturizing. There isn&#x27;t much in the bottle; it would be nice to get more of that in the kit. The spot treatment works well for individual pimples, especially if you catch them quickly. Disappointingly, the tube, though it looks large, is mostly full of air, so there are only a handful of applications in the tube. Other than the size, the kit seems like a great overall solution for mild to moderate acne that only needs occasional treatment. For the price, more serious acne that needs daily treatment should be attacked with more effective and stronger prescription solutions.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I kept using it for a few weeks as they say it may get worse before it gets better, but caused painful breakouts. but not everything works for everyone.</li>
    <li> Shipping came fast, the face wash seems to be working and it&#x27;s only been a few days! Can&#x27;t wait to see more results!</li>
    <li> So it came in the mail and one of the bottles is half empty.... Should I be worried?</li>
    <li> The foaming cleanser and lotion were fine. The smaller tube of the spot treatment was mostly air. The contents of that tube were used sparingly and barely lasted a week.</li>
    <li> Works like similar products</li>
    <li> Works great better then other items I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> This system caused my face to break out, probably related to the oil that&#x27;s in it.  I know that some oils are healthy for your face, but not this kind. I trashed it.</li>
    <li> Dried my skin out very badly. Had a respiratory reaction to something in the medication. Made me wheeze when I would use it and for about 1 hr after. Weird :/</li>
    <li> I am a teenage boy and i once had some serious acne on my face. After doing some research, i found this bad boy. This product works amazing. It took me around a week for results, but the results were amazing. My skin was clear and smooth, not a single pimple in sight. I also love this product as it doesnt leave your fave feeling completely dry like others do. I now use this every morning and night and would definitely recommend it to all of you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for three days and it&#x27;s making my skin worse. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do but hopefully because I don&#x27;t want my skin to get any worse. I&#x27;ll update if it improves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a month now, and I must say it has gotten rid of my painful pimples. Other than that nothing spectacular has happened, so I think I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
    <li> This system did a fine job of clearing up a breakout, and of keeping it at bay for a few days since. Hopefully this will continue indefinitely.</li>
    <li> Although all the products in the line DO work, the only one that I can really smell the sandalwood on is the Blemish Clearing Hydrator (the lotion, or Step 3). That&#x27;s the only reason for docking a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is highly effective (as well it should be) because it has salicylic acid, which is one of the few compounds out there that actually clears facial blemishes. I&#x27;ve not had pimples in a while, but I do get the very occasional breakout. It helped clear my pimples in a day, once I used all three products in conjunction. The facial wash, I used twice a day, followed up by the spot treatment, and the lotion all over my face. Following up the facial wash with the lotion is extremely important, because the wash is loaded with alcohol, which will dry your skin out. Best to cover your bases, and prevent your skin from blowing up with masses of oil production, because you&#x27;re too dry.</li>
    <li> My son has been using this product for about two weeks now and we have not seen a significant change in his skin condition (mild acne). In the chin area, we are actually seeing new breakouts.  I am giving the product a 4 instead of a 3 star rating because it has been our experience that different products work for different people and sometimes the produce starts being more effective after a longer time frame. If we see any difference by the end of four weeks I will adjust the review.  The product is very good quality. I love the foam wash because it encourages my son to use it. Still, we&#x27;ve not seen an improvement.</li>
    <li> My 19 year old daughter has persistent, stubborn acne and has been to a dermatologist and has used prescription products.  Aside from the worry the prescribed medications can &amp;#34;cause cancer in rats&amp;#34;, it never really resolved the acne fully anyhow.  This product regime hasn&#x27;t either, but every bit as good as an expensive doctor&#x27;s advice &amp; prescriptions would give you.  Definitely smaller less inflamed pimples using this product and face feels smoother.  Truly helps clean and clear your face and my daughter has stuck to it because she gets results.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the thing: EVERYONE&#x27;S SKIN IS DIFFERENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have breakouts every couple months, always due to having my period. (Yes, that may be TMI for some people, but it&#x27;s kind of necessary information.) &amp;#34;Luckily&amp;#34;, I received this product right about that time. I used it for nearly a week, but had to stop because it dried out my skin wayyyy too much. Now, it&#x27;s winter, so I may try again when the weather is less dry and update this review, but for now it&#x27;s enough to note that due to the amount of salicylic acid and other acne preventing/treating ingredients in this treatment set, it&#x27;s going to dry out the skin of anyone who has dry skin, normal skin, or even just slightly oily skin (I&#x27;m in that latter category).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I agree with another reviewer who said that the moisturizer really should have SPF in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point being, this did not work for my skin, but if you have VERY oily/acne-prone skin, it may work for you. And the cost of the set (currently about $35) isn&#x27;t too over the top for a product like this, so if you think your skin fits that description, this may be worth a try.</li>
    <li> My 14 year-old daughter has been using this set and really likes the way it&#x27;s keeping her skin clearer. She&#x27;s been using Mary Kay teen products for several years which worked fine, but this is doing an even better job. The foaming cleanser took a bit to get used to, but she likes it now. She hasn&#x27;t been as consistent with the moisturizer, but says her skin has not dried out on tis product. If you have a child with mild to moderate acne, this may be a great product for them to try.</li>
    <li> The Benzac Complete Acne Solution Regimen Kit has been great for my face. I&#x27;m prone to break-outs on my cheeks and I noticed the changes in my skin within the week os using this product. The Foaming Cleanser is easy to apply and will leave your skin feeling smooth and clean. The spot treatment helped clear up the break-outs on my face and it dried out the acne, but be careful because if you put it over the entire area it can dry out more than the acne so you have to be careful to use it on just the specific acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Benzac solution has salicylic Acid and that helps remove dead skin and keeps your skin renewed and vibrant. The solution is so gentle and mild,so that is a plus with me because my skin is sensitive. The Benzac Complete Acne Solution Regimen Kit works better than the topical ointments that my dermatologist prescribed me and I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Great product on sensitive skin! I prefer the smell of these over other comparable options currently on the market, it doesn&#x27;t reek of chemicals. Step 2 can feel a little harsh but the lotion keeps it from drying out the skin too much. Other products often remind me of bleach-like cleaning products and are generally unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the Benzac system for six days and I am already amazed at the results.  I am 23 with oily, acne-prone, and sensitive skin. I have been struggling with breakouts for almost twelve years now, and although my skin has gotten better over time, I still deal with occasional pimples (that almost always leave scars) and I keep searching for that product that will really make a difference, so I don&#x27;t always have to worry about my skin and how to cover it under makeup.  As I said, I have only been using the system twice a day for a few days, but I can already see a great improvement in my skin. It looks brighter, clearer, and my pores appear smaller! I can hardly believe I am getting such noticeable results from a product, and right away. It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all and I really like all three products. They feel fresh and gentle. I don&#x27;t really like the smell of these products but I guess I&#x27;m just not a fan of the sandalwood scent. If it works, I don&#x27;t care how it smells. I&#x27;ve used countless products with salicylic acid in them over the years so I can only guess it&#x27;s the sandalwood oil that&#x27;s really making a difference for me. The only thing I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in is that my skin is still pretty oily, but the system didn&#x27;t promise anything about that.  I gave the system four stars since it has only been a few days, so I will update my review based on the results it continues to give me.  [UPDATE!] Been using Benzac for a month now, and my skin is still improving every day. I actually can&#x27;t remember the last time my skin looked this good. I can&#x27;t believe the effect it has had, not just on my occasional breakouts, but on my pores and the overall look and feel of my skin itself. I wouldn&#x27;t say I had huge pores, or even big pores before I started using Benzac, but after using the system 2x a day for a month, the pores on my cheeks and nose are practically INVISIBLE. This, combined with having NO breakouts, has made my skin look so muchclearer and healthier. The only blemishes I&#x27;ve had since using Benzac have been very tiny, easy to conceal, and disappeared within a day. I think that with continued use, I won&#x27;t even have to use the spot treatment anymore, because I won&#x27;t have any spots that need extra treatment! I really think that the sandalwood oil combined with the salicylic acid is what makes this system so effective. I am severely allergic to benzoyl peroxide, which is in most three-step acne systems, so I haven&#x27;t been able to use them. I think the antibacterial properties of the sandalwood has been extremely beneficial to my skin.  My advice to you: TRY BENZAC. You&#x27;ve already tried it all, right? You have nothing to lose, except bad skin. I&#x27;m sure not everyone will get the results I have, but from my experience with these products, I really believe it is worth it to try.</li>
    <li> The benzac worked the first day I used it.It did dry myskin out. This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> Has really hepled clear my face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve certainly earned the title of chronic acne sufferer. I started getting acne at the age of 12, and I&#x27;m 24 now. I&#x27;ve had ups and downs, but my skin has never been *clear* since age 12. And yes, I&#x27;ve seen a dermatologist all these years, and I&#x27;ve had many different treatments administered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken oral antibiotics, but who wants perpetually be on pills for acne?!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a wash with sulfur for years (yes, it smells as bad you&#x27;re imagining)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Epiduo, and found out the hard way I&#x27;m allergic to benzoyl peroxide. That was very uncomfortable!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, same issue as Epiduo (it has benzoyl peroxide too, should&#x27;ve read the ingredients list before applying it)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Retin A Micro. It works fairly well, but is only effective as long as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list goes on, but those are the things I can remember off the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was shopping at Walmart and I stumbled upon Benzac on the shelf. Since benzoyl peroxide is NOT an ingredient, I decided I&#x27;d give it a fair try. Well, it&#x27;s been 2 weeks now and I can honestly say there is very, very little improvement. (I do realize acne treatment takes a very long time, as mentioned earlier, I&#x27;ve had it for 12 years. I can tell this is not going to cure me). It makes me sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming wash smells really good, kind of a sour smell, and it makes your skin feel really fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2, the spot treatment,  I have to echo what an earlier reviewer said: this stuff is going to run out way before steps 1 and 3. That needs fixed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time I saw my dermatologist, a few months ago, he mentioned a drug called Accutane. It&#x27;s a pill taken for 4 to 6 months. From what I read online, it suppresses the body&#x27;s secretion of oils. The effect is supposed to be permanent, so once the 4 to 6 months is over, the patient should not get acne again. A quick google search scared me away, with people claiming the drug causes everything from depression to joint pain. But you can&#x27;t blame every disease you get on a drug. Disclaimer: it has been proven that Accutane causes severe birth defects if a women taking the drug gets pregnant (or 6 months after taking the drug).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As all acne sufferers know, it&#x27;s got nothing to do with your hygiene. I religiously wash twice a day. It&#x27;s tough having acne, I feel really disgusting. I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try, but I&#x27;ve finally decided. I&#x27;m going to get Accutane. For me, it&#x27;s worth the risk, and after I&#x27;ve tried everything else under the sun, it&#x27;s the only option I have left. I just wanted to leave this review on here in case there are any other people who have tried everything else and are looking for a solution. You should know Accutane is very potent, very serious, and its effects are permanent. It is not for young teens just experiencing some mild acne. (Such young ones will likely find Benzac to be a satisfactory solution).&lt;br /&gt;I hope this will be helpful for someone :)</li>
    <li> I was surprised to really like the scent of this cleanser. It&#x27;s very gender-neutral and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the foaming action... makes it so easy to clean the face. The foam is very nice and rich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawback is that it leaves my skin feeling very tight. I don&#x27;t always moisturize normally, but when I use this, I definitely have to. The foaming cleanser is step 1 in their line... then there&#x27;s the spot treatment and the hydrator. I do like the hydrator. It&#x27;s mild and light, with no real scent, and dries quickly. It&#x27;s just enough moisture for me-- my face gets too oily with thicker moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On its own, the cleanser is only a mild acne repellant... each product in the line has salycyclic acid, so when you use all three together, you&#x27;re getting a high dose. The cleanser is just 0.5% and you&#x27;re washing most of it off with water, but it&#x27;s better than nothing! The hydrator has another 0.5% and it stays on your skin.</li>
    <li> This is a three step acne kit. While I only have minor problems with it, I also did not have a lot of success with it (I broke out bad right after starting it). My problems are that the cleansers fragrance is too strong and that the spot treatment burns when you apply it. I am sure this works for some better than others, since there are many things that contribute to the appearance of your skin. I don&#x27;t think I will try it again.</li>
    <li> My adult acne results from a combination of stress and hormones. So far, I&#x27;m having good results with this system. It&#x27;s been almost 30 days, and took about 25 to really start working. I actually like it when a product takes a while to work because the effects usually last longer. Some highlights from my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. PERFECT SCENT PROFILE: Finally a product that doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap perfume. The Benzac system has a pleasant, herbal scent that smells great going on your body but quickly fades. Fantastic. I&#x27;m so tired of products trying to compete to be THE smell on my body. Hey companies: I choose cologne for that. I don&#x27;t want to smell like my acne product. Ok?&lt;br /&gt;2. BALANCED AMOUNT OF PRODUCT: This system comes with three steps. I&#x27;ve tried many multi-step systems and I dislike it when one or two bottles run out way before the other(s). It ends up being wasteful--particularly with products that are only sold in kits. The Benzac system is well balanced--the bottles are each about 2/3rds empty after a month of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;3. SKIN ISN&#x27;T OVERLY DRY: We all know that acne systems dry out your skin and can create a vicious cycle of clearing your skin only to have the requisite moisturizing create further acne troubles. This system isn&#x27;t drying my skin out like others do. I love that the lotion aspect goes on lightly and leaves my skin feeling soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a system I will continue using. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and has good results.</li>
    <li> The Benzac Complete Acne Solution Regimen Kit has been such a blessing for my teenage granddaughter! Her acne was much more on her chest and back, with some break outs on her pretty face. We used the three step process on all three areas and have had amazing results. Her skin is much clearer after just 10 days of use. We have seen no adverse reactions with these products. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> The skin on the bridge of my nose developed a rough texture and seemed to be more oily than normal. I have tried several different products but without any improvement. This Benzac is listed as an acne solution but my problem is not acne it is something I never had before and is very annoying and flaky. Because Benzac is a product for the skin I figured why not give it a try even though I don&#x27;t have acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this on  my nose and was surprised that it has no scent that I could notice. The pump feature on the bottle makes it convenient to extract  the cream. I was very careful in applying this cream because my trouble spot is close to my eyes. In about a day and a half I noticed a definite improvement. The skin was undergoing a positive smoothing out. There have been no negative effects with this usage. This has been a very pleasant surprise because of its description as an acne solution.</li>
    <li> This product worked great at first. I have had issues with hormonal acne for a few years now and nothing seems to work for it. I saw the commercials so I went to the store and bought benzac. It worked for about a month but now it doesnt work at all :(. I&#x27;m still on the search for something to help with my acne.</li>
    <li> The Benzac Ance Treatment is a three step system: a complete skin care regimine. The cleanser is a foam that is supposed to set a minute and then be rinsed. It is followed by a spot treatment therapy. I guess it was working because it burns when applied. The last step is the moisturizer, which both feels and smells pleasant on your skin. I used the three step treatment religiously, every day, and overall I felt it helped some but didn&#x27;t produce the results I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> This kit works quickly from the start and the kit is easy to use.  My skin hasn&#x27;t dried out, but I am only using the product once a day - so it&#x27;s drying my acne up but not over drying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions on step 2 &amp; 3 (Intensive spot treatment &amp; Blemish Clearing Hydrator) are exactly the same, so you don&#x27;t really know when you should be using what.  They both state to cleanse the skin thoroughly before applying this product and then cover the entire affected area with a thin layer once or twice daily.  So am I supposed to use both of them at the same time, one on top of the other?  If so, the directions do not make this clear.  If not, when do I use one in place of the other.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my daughter&#x27;s acne, but actually seemed to make it worse. I thought she&#x27;d broken out in a rash one day and she assured me the only thing she&#x27;d used on her face was this product. Maybe there are some traces of nuts in this line, so it might work for others and this could be the reason she broke out (she&#x27;s allergic to tree nuts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work for my daughter, so I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> It really does get rid of acne. I noticed a difference within a day. But the moisturizer smells AWFUL. You will have to use a moisturizer from something else. And the step 2 in the set, the spot treatment tube, is practically all air. Don&#x27;t use gobs of it because you don&#x27;t need to and you don&#x27;t have a lot to waste in that tube.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this product for about a month and her skin has greatly improved! She started out using it once a day, for 4 days then from there on to twice a day. It&#x27;s not been overly drying to her skin. It&#x27;s got a very nice smell and we&#x27;re very happy! She was a previous Proactiv user. We are happier with Benzac!</li>
    <li> I have had pretty bad acne for awhile when I tried this Benzac acne kit. I have used it for 2 months and seen AMAZING results! The facewash is great, I use it with an electric spin brush. The moisturizer is great after washing my face as well. The only thing I had to stop using was the spot treatment. Since its 2% Salic Acid it really dried out my face, and not in a good way... My face got super red and irritated after using the spot treatment. BUT once I stopped using it all the redness went away and now I just continue to use the facewash and moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this acne kit, just be careful with the spot treatment!</li>
    <li> Works great I haven&#x27;t experienced any dryness. My blemishes are fading. I&#x27;ve tried alot of different products but this has worked the best. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> The Benzac Acne Regimen, like most acne products, is not something that will automatically make breakouts vanish overnight. This treatment routine takes time, and it took about a month for me to really start noticing a difference. However, everybody&#x27;s skin is different, and will react to the Benzac treatment differently. So results may very.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three bottles for the three steps included in the regimen, The first bottle is a basic skin cleanser, the second is a very strong treatment that dries out your acne, and the third bottle is an acne-preventing moisturizer that is necessary after using the second. If you do not use the moisturizer, your skin will become flaky and very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal results have been fairly positive, and my skin simply feels and looks so much cleaner and less oily. However, as I previously stated, all skin reacts differently, so I suggest that you continue this acne routine daily. Personally, I think this is a great regimen to try!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with acne as a recurrent condition, but my face started to break out when I began using probiotics (apparently, a semi-common temporary issue) and I got this to minimize/treat the breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really worked well, drying up the breakouts without drying my skin out, and my face looks generally clearer and healthier after using it. Application is simple, and as a bonus, I greatly enjoy the sandalwood fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to its performance against persistent conditional acne, but as a general solution against breakouts or for clearer skin, I recommend it heartily.</li>
    <li> The Benzac Complete Acne Solution Regimen Kit, 7.5 Ounce 3 Step System includes 6.0oz of Step 1 - Cleanse with 0.5% Salicylic Acid, 0.5oz of Step 2 Treat with 2.0% Salicylic Acid, and 1.0oz of Step 3 Hydrate with 0.5% Salicylic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic Acid is the single &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; ingredient for all three steps but Galderma Benzac Acne Solutions includes many supportive ingredients what help exfoliate, removes excess oil, soothes and hydrates skin. all with a natural herbal scent that comes from the ingredients, not from perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The primary listed component of supporting ingredients is &amp;#34;East Indian Sandalwood&amp;#34;. The box describes it  &amp;#34;East Indian Sandalwood is one of nature’s rare and ancient healers. Now, sustainably grown in a rehabilitated forest, the oil is extracted using renewable energy, resulting in the world&#x27;s only therapeutic grade of East Indian Sandalwood Oil. This exceptional ingredient, which is known to have gentle antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, is the secret to Benzac&#x27;s clinically proven acne-fighting formulas, designed to help give you clear and healthy skin&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1, the Skin Balancing Foaming cleanser is in the largest bottle yet the directions for use are hidden under a 2 layer label you have to peel back to see the product details. Step 2 and 3 which are very small packages manage to fit all the relevant information without resorting to a peel back for more information label. Perhaps the Step 1 bottle is labeled for individual sale but I wish the information that you might want to use on a regular basis - the directions for use, was visible from the outer label and the inner label was used just for the list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging has lot numbers and exp date, the date on my package was about 15 months from the time of receipt, plenty of time to use the product.</li>
