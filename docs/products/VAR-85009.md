      <li>I like Mac&#x27;s better but this&#x27;ll work</li>
      <li>I think that you are just better off using dawn dish soap.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell the best, and it leaves my white brushes...</li>
      <li>I like the beauty blender shampoo sooooo much better.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s best to use them together, but you could probably use it alone too on brushes that are only used with powder products.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love e.l.f. Products.</li>
      <li>This brush shampoo is just OK</li>
      <li>After purchasing and falling in love with the elf spray cleaner, I bought this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even though cleaning brushes is time consuming, this stuff definitely works and for a great price, as well!!</li>
      <li>I love using e.l.f cosmetics.</li>
      <li>I have realized that this shampoo does have an interesting odor..</li>
      <li>(Synthetic hair brushes are more forgiving to be used and handled this way.)</li>
      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t know that you were supposed to clean makeup bushes FOR YEARS.</li>
      <li>Very easy to clean also.</li>
      <li>Good as new!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t seem to be able to get my brushes clean with it</li>
      <li>/&gt;This can be easily replaced with (and trumped by) an antibacterial soap + olive oil or baby shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty effective and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It did the job, the smell was totally fine, and it was easy.</li>
      <li>and I think it did the job just fine.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like elf because of their reputation for being a cheap brand</li>
      <li>this works wonderfully cleaned my brushes and left them soft and useable will use it often and buy it when needing more</li>
      <li>The shipping was free and it got here in two days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>In fact, I went through a bottle of baby shampoo trying to wash my favorite powder brush and favorite foundation because it took so much product.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo does nothing amazing in particular.</li>
      <li>already makes a plethora of super affordable, great quality products and this brush shampoo is no different.</li>
      <li>I did receive it quickly and the packaging was fine.</li>
      <li>Clean brushes, no damage and no dented wallet.</li>
      <li>Like any brush shampoo I have found it takes a lot of product to get your brushes clean.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t clean well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s shampoo, and it works like a lathering shampoo, but it&#x27;s way cheaper to just clean your brushes with olive oil and Dawn dish soap.</li>
      <li>I used it to clean concealer brush</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean my brushes well, but what can I expect with three bucks...</li>
      <li>Depending on what you use your brush for; it may not get clean with just shampooing.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re clean, nothing gor ruined, and the price is right!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not disgusting, but it certainly isn&#x27;t pleasing.</li>
      <li>It is just as good as higher priced brands and leaves your brushes so clean and soft.</li>
      <li>I think this would only be good for eyeshadow brushes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: good product if used properly.</li>
      <li>I really like this and am going to buy more when I run out.</li>
      <li>Clear liquid and honest to God, cleans all the gunk out of my brushes.</li>
      <li>Works amazing and leaves my brushes super soft</li>
      <li>I would reccomend using a brush egg along with it to get a really fresh clean.</li>
      <li>This really gets your brushes clean!</li>
      <li>Very soft :)</li>
      <li>I refuse to use any other shampoo on my brushes just because of the amazing finish it leaves on the bristles!</li>
      <li>I like using this product because it does clean your make up brushes pretty well.</li>
      <li>It leaves a &#x60;fresh&#x27; scent that is o.k.</li>
      <li>And they were not really dirty to start with.</li>
      <li>Such a handy thing to have.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their brushes clean, healthy, and soft.</li>
      <li>I use it to clean my uber expensive cosmetic brushes with no worries and it does the job wonderfully.</li>
      <li>used it as soon as it arrived and the make up came right off the brushes.</li>
      <li>I have a very used foundation brush that came clean within seconds of applying the cleaner.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many many different types of brush cleaners and thought that they did a pretty good job but holy cow!!!</li>
      <li>Believe it or not, it really doesn&#x27;t take much of this to wash either or my brushes and is easy to rinse out.  </li>
      <li>It gets them really clean and my brushes are super soft.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle shampoo.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work great for me. I had to use a ton of this stuff just to get some gel eyeliner off of one brush, which is not what I was expecting at all. Overall I&#x27;ve had much better results in quicker time just using regular hand soap or shampoo.</li>
    <li> Last time I let my gf use my amazon acct... According to her, product works as described</li>
    <li> This brush shampoo is just OK, it does not remove the oil base from my brushes when I use them to apply my foundation. It needs to be a stronger formula that will remove the build up without damaging my brushes.</li>
    <li> E.L.F&#x27;s brush shampoo is the best brush shampoo I have ever used for the fact that after I wash my brushes, my makeup comes out smoother than ever. I have realized that this shampoo does have an interesting odor..it&#x27;s not disgusting, but it certainly isn&#x27;t pleasing. However, as long as the shampoo gets the job done then I have no complaints. I refuse to use any other shampoo on my brushes just because of the amazing finish it leaves on the bristles!</li>
    <li> It works so well to clean my brushes, and you only need a small ammount.</li>
    <li> I have been washing my brushes with baby shampoo and thought I might try this since it seemed very affordable.  The actual product is much smaller than I had anticipated and doesn&#x27;t work NEARLY as well as I thought. It takes quite a bit to get my brushes clean and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it will last long at all.  I ended up giving it to my mom. I will just keep using my baby shampoo. I did receive it quickly and the packaging was fine.</li>
    <li> I have tried many many different types of brush cleaners and thought that they did a pretty good job but holy cow!!! This product is amazing!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe what it took out of my brushes. even my ancient brushes that i thought were just stained became just like new!! The bristles of my brushes are still soft and not dried out like some brush cleaners can do. I will never buy anything but this product EVER again!</li>
    <li> This shampoo does nothing amazing in particular. It simply just washes your brushes. My regular hand soap can do the job of this product. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Way smaller than I expected and not as soapy as I would like but it work well</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean my brushes well, but what can I expect with three bucks...</li>
    <li> Larger than anticipated!</li>
    <li> The problem I had with the product was that it had arrived leaking! If I could I would like to exchange the bottle for the the same thing. Everything was still in tact however the product was leaking I&#x27;m not quite sure what to do except mail it back there is no invoice so I&#x27;ll do my best maybe the postmaster can help me. OH! The box was also in bad shape when it arrived so I did my best to keep it in it&#x27;s original form thank you Melissa Brittelle Oh as far as rating, I&#x27;m just rating on products I&#x27;ve used like movies &amp; stuff</li>
    <li> This brush shampoo is a great bargain. It leaves a &#x60;fresh&#x27; scent that is o.k. for me (I am sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect this shampoo to clean all your brushes equally, as not all brushes are equal or get used the same. Depending on what you use your brush for; it may not get clean with just shampooing. If you use a brush for foundation, concealer, long-wearing cream eye shadow, primers, liners, etc., then you most likely need to dip your brush in a solvent based cleaner first, blot it on a paper towel until you &#x27;break down&#x27; or dissolve the product on the brush. (Synthetic hair brushes are more forgiving to be used and handled this way.) Many of the new product formulations contain ingredients that are almost &#x60;water resistant&#x27;, so you have to break down the product before you can get the water and shampoo to do its&#x27; job. (Note: Isopropyl Alcohol 70% works great as a solvent for the job, with the added bonus of disinfecting your brushes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: good product if used properly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so awesome. The shipping was free and it got here in two days.&lt;br /&gt;I used it as soon as it arrived and the make up came right off the brushes. I am very happy. I love using e.l.f cosmetics.</li>
    <li> but I just bought new brushes and needed a shampoo to go with them. This was pretty much the cheapest, and it seems to do the trick!</li>
    <li> Cleans really well. No scent and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t know that you were supposed to clean makeup bushes FOR YEARS. I had always wondered why I broke out after a few applications of something. Now I&#x27;m an avid brush cleaner. I had been using an antibacterial hand cleaner to clean by brushes but started to notice that the bristles would dry a lot stiffer than I thought they should and felt like there was residue. A friend of mine suggested baby shampoo but I really wanted something that was antibacterial since i&#x27;m prone to breakouts. I really like this brush shampoo because it rinses cleanly and leaves my brushes feeling soft and new. It takes just about a drop of this shampoo to do the job. I use this in combination with e.l.f.&#x27;s Daily Brush Cleaner to keep my brushes cleaner between shampoos.</li>
    <li> Works really well, even gets the waterproof gunk i&#x27;ve been trying to get out of my brushes for years. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I like Mac&#x27;s better but this&#x27;ll work</li>
    <li> This brush cleanser works really well and makes my brushes look like new. I would reccomend using a brush egg along with it to get a really fresh clean.</li>
    <li> I liked this brush shampoo. It did the job, the smell was totally fine, and it was easy. I even cleaned an old brush with it and it&#x27;s like new again. I recommend ecotools brushes fyi. I got them from my sister for x-mas and they rule! Very soft :)</li>
    <li> I really like this brush shampoo.  My brushes stay soft and clean.  I use this once a week usually, sometimes I go a little longer.  I like the fact that this shampoo is designed for brushes as opposed to using baby shampoo which is designed for babies.  I recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their brushes clean, healthy, and soft.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  This little bottle is inexpensive, does a beautiful job of getting my brushes clean, and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for over a year and it&#x27;s still going.  A bargain!  How-to instructions for using it on my blog: http://thebeautyofmidlife.com/2015/05/how-to-and-how-often-to-clean-your-makeup-brushes/</li>
    <li> This was the first brush cleanswer I&#x27;ve ever used and I think it did the job just fine.  They&#x27;re clean, nothing gor ruined, and the price is right!</li>
    <li> For a person who&#x27;s attempted all the home products remedies, this was a great product to use. It cleaned my gunked up makeup brushes in a fraction of time it usually takes me. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> This works really well. I havent noticed anything weird happening to my brushes or anything and this wasnt that expensive either.</li>
    <li> No need for $20 brush shampoos when you have the ever reliable e.l.f. cosmetics line on your side! E.l.f. already makes a plethora of super affordable, great quality products and this brush shampoo is no different. I use it to clean my uber expensive cosmetic brushes with no worries and it does the job wonderfully. Clean brushes, no damage and no dented wallet.</li>
    <li> Such a handy thing to have. It works perfectly. The formula is great. Not expensive at all. Definitely loved it!</li>
    <li> This cleaner is amazing!  I was very skeptical that it would work but was pleasantly surprised. I have a very used foundation brush that came clean within seconds of applying the cleaner.  I hope there is a bigger sized bottle because I am definitely going to be using this quite often.</li>
    <li> I have about 20 makeup brushes and this works excellent! Even though cleaning brushes is time consuming, this stuff definitely works and for a great price, as well!! Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> for the price of the product it works great. It is just as good as higher priced brands and leaves your brushes so clean and soft. Would recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Cleans brushes well, great for the price. Leaves them soft and like new.</li>
    <li> this works wonderfully cleaned my brushes and left them soft and useable will use it often and buy it when needing more</li>
    <li> I use this with a brush mitt (if you don&#x27;t have one, search amazon!!) for cleaning and it gets my brushes back to white every time.</li>
    <li> Today I received my product. Delivery really fast , not yet tested , but so do I leave a new comment . so far very good, recommend , excellent product.</li>
    <li> Great product gets the job done</li>
    <li> I love it! It thoroughly cleaned all of my brushes and did not leave any residue.</li>
    <li> Seems good, cleaned my makeup brushes as well as more expensive brands.  Price was very good, as it always is with elf.</li>
    <li> I did not like this.  It only washed away a little bit of foundation from my brush.  I even used alot to get a good lather, but it didn&#x27;t work.  I think this would only be good for eyeshadow brushes.  I like the beauty blender shampoo sooooo much better.</li>
    <li> This does a great job cleaning my makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> Pretty pricey for a shampoo but thought I&#x27;d try it out.  It&#x27;s shampoo, and it works like a lathering shampoo, but it&#x27;s way cheaper to just clean your brushes with olive oil and Dawn dish soap.</li>
    <li> A little dab doesn&#x27;t go a long way to clean makeup brush took about 3 dime size dabs to get all make up residue on brush. First time using product don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
    <li> Cleaned my brushes well without drying them out</li>
    <li> I recently picked this up.  I was a bit skeptical because the reviews weren&#x27;t all sunshine and roses.  I was really impressed with this, though.  My favorite brush is hard to rinse clean when I used dish soap and hard to lather when I use baby shampoo.  In fact, I went through a bottle of baby shampoo trying to wash my favorite powder brush and favorite foundation because it took so much product.  Believe it or not, it really doesn&#x27;t take much of this to wash either or my brushes and is easy to rinse out.  I use this with my E.L.F. Daily Brush Cleaner first, and swirling them around on a clean cloth to break up some of the B.B. cream.  Then I shampoo the brushes.  It gets them really clean and my brushes are super soft.  The one thing I am confused about is why it is so much on amazon.com.  On the E.L.F. website the shampoo is $3.00 and when I got my two bottles at Kmart they were only $2.99 apiece (along with my two bottles of Daily Brush Cleaner).  All in all I would recommend giving both of these products a try.  I think it&#x27;s best to use them together, but you could probably use it alone too on brushes that are only used with powder products.  I really like this and am going to buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Makes my brushes smell weird</li>
    <li> Really good it works great although i would recommend getting a brush scrub too.</li>
    <li> They really cleaned my brushes without dry them</li>
    <li> I BROUGHT THIS FOR A PHOTO SHOOT AND THIS WORKED PERFECT. I WILL BUY AGAIN. GREAT PRODUCT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
    <li> Happy. Great product.</li>
    <li> this worked for me its very concentrated so i didn&#x27;t  have to use much so it will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Cleans my brush very well and keeps them soft and fluffy</li>
    <li> This item does not work well would recommend something else.</li>
    <li> This really gets your brushes clean!</li>
    <li> Works amazing and leaves my brushes super soft</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love it! the shampoo cleans and softens my brush&#x27;s better than I thought possible. Only downside is the slight smell from it but its seriously no big deal.</li>
    <li> Works great, I truly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like using this product because it does clean your make up brushes pretty well. It&#x27;s just it can dry them out a little, so I suggest adding a drop or two of extra virgin olive oil with the product as you wash your brushes. It. Does. Wonders.</li>
    <li> After purchasing and falling in love with the elf spray cleaner, I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be easily replaced with (and trumped by) an antibacterial soap + olive oil or baby shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times, and I will continue using it until it is gone, but it&#x27;s not worth repurchasing. It doesn&#x27;t smell the best, and it leaves my white brushes...whatever color they were before I cleaned them. Boo! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well. No need to spend a ridiculous amount of money, when his product can do the exact same thing. My brushes are noticeably softer after getting all the grime off with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love e.l.f. Products. Heads up, it only costs $3 everywhere else including Walmart.</li>
    <li> Very gentle shampoo. Clear liquid and honest to God, cleans all the gunk out of my brushes. Even my cheapest ones, without leaving traces like some brush shampoos do. Very easy to clean also. No stickiness left in brushes, and gentle enough to use even on my cheapest ones without hurting or damaging them.</li>
    <li> Did wonders on my old blush brush but took a few times to clean my thicker foundation and powder brushes. I like it though and it&#x27;s pretty effective and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My brushes are all clean and soft. Good as new!</li>
    <li> Like any brush shampoo I have found it takes a lot of product to get your brushes clean. I think that you are just better off using dawn dish soap.</li>
    <li> Clean brushes lead to beautiful &amp; healthy makeup!</li>
    <li> Gentle and doesn&#x27;t smell bad which is great. The formula isn&#x27;t like syrup and it lathers well on the brushes. I don&#x27;t like elf because of their reputation for being a cheap brand but I changed my mind for this little bottle was a surprise in both quality and price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this worked well.  Maybe there is a trick to it?  I didn&#x27;t seem to be able to get my brushes clean with it and I didn&#x27;t want to dunk my brushes in water.  It could just be me...</li>
    <li> I appreciate this product for it&#x27;s antibacterial properties but it did not work well on my white brushes.After soaping them up three times there are still some visible makeup residue left.And they were not really dirty to start with.I just  used them to put on some eye shadow and bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;Than I used it to clean concealer brush and it did not work at all to clean out thick waxy product from brush.&lt;br /&gt; Very unimpressed with actual cleaning power of this brush shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer 2:1 ratio mix of any color free antibacterial dish soap and olive oil for heavy duty washing.</li>
    <li> shipped very quickly, works great.</li>
    <li> works great, lathers great, great product</li>
    <li> Love this brush shampoo, It removes all the product from the brushes without leaving soapy residue on the brushes! :)</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t clean well. Save your money for something that works.  It&#x27;s not worth it even at half the price</li>
    <li> Love elf products works amazing and smells azing</li>
