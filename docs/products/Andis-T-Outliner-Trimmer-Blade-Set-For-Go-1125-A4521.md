<li> My son uses the trimmer for his military style haircut</li>
<li> and we tend to replace the blades every other year.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be sharp.</li>
<li> The only real gripe I have is that the replacement set doesn&#x27;t come with extra screws which is beyond dissatisfying and beyond stupid in my eyes</li>
<li> By the time I returned to the site they had taken the machine down and had up this picture.</li>
<li> That was not nice at all.</li>
<li> Not sure if I got the bad one out of the batch but certainly not the replacement I was expecting..</li>
<li> Even after I readjusted it is still lousy.</li>
<li> Fits perfectly, no adjusting needed</li>

    <li> I used this blade for a day. Turns out my old one cuts better than this one. Even after I readjusted it is still lousy.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be sharp. It&#x27;s not giving the clean barber mark look that I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Fit well with my outliners</li>
    <li> I mean the blades are fine I guess, you just have to be able to adjust them. The only real gripe I have is that the replacement set doesn&#x27;t come with extra screws which is beyond dissatisfying and beyond stupid in my eyes but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal though.</li>
    <li> Percect. As advertised works great for my t outliner</li>

    <li> My son uses the trimmer for his military style haircut and we tend to replace the blades every other year.</li>
    <li> NOT SO GOOD THE BLADES WERE NOT SHARP ENOUGH</li>
    <li> The whole machine was advertise. When I receive my package it was only the blade. That was not nice at all. By the time I returned to the site they had taken the machine down and had up this picture. It was very deceiving to me.</li>
    <li> Perfect blades and great product</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly, no adjusting needed</li>
    <li> if your selling blade replacements show the picture of the replaccement blades and not a picture of clippers, thought i was getting a good deal on clippers but instead i have blades i dont need.....very misleading</li>
    <li> Fit and replaced old ones wonderful... excellent for your money.....</li>
    <li> Best buy for your money ..awhile lot cheaper than getting at a store ..quality very good as well .</li>
    <li> Good price, good product.  Works.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I got the bad one out of the batch but certainly not the replacement I was expecting.. Seems though it wasn&#x27;t calibrated to where they are supposed to be..</li>
