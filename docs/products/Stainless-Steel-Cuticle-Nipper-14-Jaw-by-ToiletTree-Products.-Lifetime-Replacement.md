      <li>I am a happy customer so far</li>
      <li>This means it works but requires a lot more pressure to cut and isn&#x27;t as precise as it should be.</li>
      <li>This item was exactly as specified, and is just perfect for what we wanted it for:  to carry with us and be able to nip cuticles and such as needed.  </li>
      <li>The handle style is designed much better tnan the one I originally bought at a cosmetics store.</li>
      <li>They are easy to use.</li>
      <li>They make clean precise cuts and you cant beat that warranty!</li>

      <li>I bought this cuticle clipper and it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I like to have smooth cuticles but</li>
      <li>Definitely fantastic product.</li>
      <li>This cuticle nipper is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This one is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and was precisely what I wanted.</li>
      <li>We love the lifetime guarantee, and they are gentle and precise on our cuticles.</li>
      <li>Based on so many positive reviews , I ordered the cuticle nipper from ToiletTree.</li>
      <li>good, comfortable, soft and gently cut unnecessary.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are great nippers that are sharp and get the job done.</li>
      <li>These clippers replaced some that I&#x27;d had for many years that finally gave up the ghost :).  </li>
      <li>These are the right size and clip cleanly leaving a smooth-edged nail.</li>
      <li>The nipper is sharp, comfortable to hold in your hand and appears to be of good quality.  </li>
      <li>They are totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>worth the price...</li>
      <li>In my opinion worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to gnaw at them, so need a good, sharp cuticle nipper.</li>
      <li>They are sharp and good quality.</li>
      <li>Infact, it looks a well as our original stainless steel one from Germany.  </li>
      <li>This is a great instrument and very well made, and very sharp...</li>
      <li>I like the quality of the  nipper, but I rather it a little bit more sharper, so that I can cut the cuticle better.</li>
      <li>I do not use them professionally or anything, but I&#x27;m always looking for a good pair of nippers that I know will last!</li>
      <li>If small sharp cuticle clippers are important, get the best.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted, but it doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>
      <li>You would think that a lifetime replacement item would at least work great in the beginning.</li>
      <li>I would be willing to try again if you would replace the nipper.</li>
      <li>They are sturdy and perform exactly as they should.</li>
      <li>The main problem is that the scissors do not provide a high quality, clean cut.  </li>
      <li>Reading the fine print I discovered that many clippers that looked identical in the pictures (even some also by Tioletrees and packaged similarly) were much smaller.  </li>
      <li>I am hoping that I will not be in need of a new pair of nippers for quite some time, but I will surely purchase my next pair from this company.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality steel with precision cutting edges.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Customer Service is fast and efficient</li>
      <li>These come out fairly straight so that the edge was in line with the handle.</li>
      <li>...I can say that I really like this nipper.</li>
      <li>I am now doing the whole families cuticles</li>
      <li>ToiletTree does care about customer satisfaction - their after-sales department is fast and efficient.</li>
      <li>They were 5.5 inches long which made them easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>These work great or at least as well as my old ones did when they were new.</li>
      <li>I contacted the company directly to inquire about sharpening services, and was surprised with a full replacement at no cost.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The small ball slips out every time I use it. Either I am using it wrong or I have a defective product.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted, but it doesn&#x27;t cut. It is beautiful looking.  Infact, it looks a well as our original stainless steel one from Germany.  The trick is that it should cut but doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Worthless... they are so cheaply made that we can&#x27;t use them. we just threw them away. You might as well get them at the dollar tree and I still bet they would work better.</li>
    <li> These clippers replaced some that I&#x27;d had for many years that finally gave up the ghost :).  They are excellent in quality, and actually cut better than my favorites ever did. They fit well in the hand, perfectly weighted, and are exceptionally precise in what they cut. They also don&#x27;t tear the cuticle at all. The lifetime guarantee is a bonus as well!</li>
    <li> These clippers were broken upon arrival.  The hinge that keeps the jaws spread apart fell off and, upon closer inspection, it was apparent that the screw used to keep it in place was not properly machined.  Extremely disappointing given the price of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After writing this review, I received an unprompted email from the president of Toilet Tree in which he apologized for the poor quality of the nippers which I received.  Although I had already received my refund from Amazon, he offered to replace the nippers at no cost.  He promptly sent out not only the replacement nippers, which were defect-free, but also a bonus pair of tweezers, along with a hand-written note.  WOW!  Talk about OUTSTANDING customer service!  I am hoping that I will not be in need of a new pair of nippers for quite some time, but I will surely purchase my next pair from this company.</li>
    <li> Cuts well, easy to open and close, awesome product even though it was pricey.  but lifetime replacement can&#x27;t be beat!  love this product and would definitely buy from Toilet Tree company again if I need cuticle products!</li>
    <li> Tired of purchasing cuticle nippers that weren&#x27;t sharpen enough, not functionally designed or both, I decided to make a research hopeful to find a permanent solution that would replace the pile of rejected nail gadgets in my toiletry. Based on so many positive reviews , I ordered the cuticle nipper from ToiletTree. Upon receiving the product, which came really fast, despite the functional design - the blades are narrow and straight, with non-slip grip handles - it wasn&#x27;t sharp enough to cut some thin peeled skin on my nail bed. I contacted the company directly to inquire about sharpening services, and was surprised with a full replacement at no cost. Besides lifetime warranty and excellent product, they have an outstanding customer service.</li>
    <li> Original tool that was sent looked good, but was not the cutting edge I needed--it was defective. Contacted the company through Amazon, and they were GREAT. New item was shipped out so quickly along with a couple of other tools for the inconvenience. (They sent me an AWESOME nail clipper and tweezer--they work!) What great service, and quality tools. (They even included a personal note.) Now, this was pretty impressive!!! And the new nipper works well. :) Their \\&quot;Lifetime Replacement Guarantee\\&quot; means something to them...and me! Thank you ToiletTree!</li>
    <li> Nippers good, comfortable, soft and gently cut unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;Do not hurt.&lt;br /&gt;I would like a longer cutting portion. I hope that they will stay sharp for a long time.</li>
    <li> I like to have smooth cuticles but either the shape or sharpness leave my cuticles ragged. It&#x27;s good enough but not as great as I had hoped</li>
    <li> These are great clippers, and the lifetime replacement warranty can&#x27;t be beat.  They are sturdy and perform exactly as they should.</li>
    <li> It looks well made at first but the cutting edges do not meet flush nor do the tips. This means it works but requires a lot more pressure to cut and isn&#x27;t as precise as it should be. I was hoping to replace an old German-made pair but this one disappoints.</li>
    <li> These work just great for what I needed. I do not use them professionally or anything, but I&#x27;m always looking for a good pair of nippers that I know will last!</li>
    <li> I opened the package to find the chrome coating on these chipped, some sort of debris  in nooks and crannies. They looked used and were returned. I&#x27;ll never order from this manufacturer again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the cuticle nippers. They are just as described. Work  well and are very sharp. I especially bought them because of the lifetime warranty. I would definitely purchase other items from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Nice clippers.  I am not sure how the return for sharpening works, but these clippers are sharp now and are a good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many cuticle nippers but this has to be the worse.  It doesn&#x27;t cut, it tears.  The angle of the jaws is such that it doesn&#x27;t get close enough to the cuticle and you then have to use the very tips to try and cut but it&#x27;s too dull. I thought that the reviews would help me pick out a good reliable nippers but they didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> These are just like the ones they use at the nail salon.  It gets down in the cuticle or hang nail and gets it out with ease--careful they are sharp!</li>
    <li> the item is a little too bulky at the blade end.  would have liked it to have a bit more &#x27;control&#x27; in what it is cutting</li>
    <li> ToiletTree does care about customer satisfaction - their after-sales department is fast and efficient. Otherwise, if you look for a sharp nipper made of top notch materials, please consider to search a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIKE&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service is fast and efficient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISLIKE&lt;br /&gt;Nipper was not sharp&lt;br /&gt;Not high quality material</li>
    <li> Excellent cuticle nipper. The handle style is designed much better tnan the one I originally bought at a cosmetics store.</li>
    <li> I bought this cuticle clipper and it is fantastic. Nothing like the ones you find at the drug store. Excellent quality steel with precision cutting edges. I am now doing the whole families cuticles it works a treat!</li>
    <li> I bote this product after I read some reviews on the internet, however this nipper is not sharp and does not cut.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with this Cuticle Nipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommended.</li>
    <li> So happy when it arrived and yet very disappointed it doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s hardly sharpen such a waste of miney</li>
    <li> Use these often and I&#x27;m completely happy with the size and the way they work.  A staple for me.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product.  It is very sharp.  I have purchased many many cuticle nippers in the past and they have gone dull and were nowhere near this sharp.  I would&#x27;ve have given it 5 stars however, the little &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; that is found between the handles is CONSTANTLY slipping out!!! This is very frustrating! :-(  I will contact the manufacturer or Amazon to find out what my options are.  Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend these nippers.</li>
    <li> These work great or at least as well as my old ones did when they were new. I was disappointed they were made in China. I try to NOT buy Chinese made products do to labor and human suppression issues.</li>
    <li> This is a great instrument and very well made, and very sharp...With care will last a lifetime....</li>
    <li> These cuticle nippers were to expensive for the quality. They didn&#x27;t cut good or last long enough. Good service from the dealer but not good quality nippers.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly as specified, and is just perfect for what we wanted it for:  to carry with us and be able to nip cuticles and such as needed.  Happily, this one seems much sharper than others that I have owned.  Product arrived quickly and was precisely what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This is not real sharp.  It is a huge disappointment.  I would not purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my girlfriend for Xmas because the lower priced ones get dull quickly.  These nippers got dull even faster and the screw that hold in the openning spring was so short it fell out and can&#x27;t be tightened.  High price does not equal high quality with these nippers. I am sending them in for warrantee replacement and I will report again after I see what kind of treatment I get from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the quality of this product .The nipper didn&#x27;t cut but rather tore my cuticle( ouch ). I would be willing to try again if you would replace the nipper. Maybe I simply got a bad one. If this happens again I would try a different brand before I ask for a credit.</li>
    <li> These are great nippers that are sharp and get the job done. I use them a lot since it&#x27;s very dry where I live and my hands and cuticles are always in bad shape.  They came quickly and I recommend shopping here as it was an excellent experience.</li>
    <li> I have so much trouble with cuticles and have a number of nippers at home. They all lose their sharpness, but one. This one is fantastic. My cuticles get dry and icky and drive me crazy. I don&#x27;t want to gnaw at them, so need a good, sharp cuticle nipper. The best thing about this brand is that it has a lifetime guarantee for sharpness. That really appealed to me and made the expensive price well worth it. Definitely fantastic product.</li>
    <li> They seem to have a good warranty but could be sharper. I have been using them a few weeks and have purchased better at the drug store.</li>
    <li> These are the sharpest cuticle nippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I was worried they were a little pricey but after using them I can see why. They are totally worth the money. If you&#x27;re a bit of a perfectionist about manicures like I am, then you will love these.</li>
    <li> I like the quality of the  nipper, but I rather it a little bit more sharper, so that I can cut the cuticle better.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, small cutting surface, and works really well. Everything you could hope for in a cuticle nipper. I have had many that were not good, including the ones from Amazon that come 3 in a pkg. for about 18 dollars. It is worth it to spend the extra money for this product!</li>
    <li> Very sharp, feel like a surgeon using this. I needed nice healthy nails for classical guitar, this and a nice nail file did the trick.</li>
    <li> Used them once so far and really impressed with the comfortable feel in the hand, sharpness of the tool and ease of use.</li>
    <li> Is scratched which should have been seen as it was visible in the packaging.  Inner tension bar keeps slipping.  Not really worth the money.</li>
    <li> Clips what needs to be clipped according to my wife.</li>
    <li> I got a well used and dirty nipper. The box was just wrapped by scotch and the nipper was not sharp at all. I assume that they probably put someones old and used nipper. As they stated lifetime replacement. Definitely going to return!</li>
    <li> ...I can say that I really like this nipper. It is a nice weight and size, handles are smooth but not slippery (helpful for preventing accidental nicks). This helps me keep the in-growns out.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s toe nails are so thick, the standard nail clippers can&#x27;t begin to do the job. This pair is definitely &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; and also extremely well-made. My husband is totally pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using high quality cuticle scissors for 40+ years.  This is the worst one I have ever had.  The main problem is that the scissors do not provide a high quality, clean cut.  After I realized how poor the scissors were cutting, I tried to find someone who would sharpen them but I couldn&#x27;t find anyone, and, to make matters worse, it is now too late for me to return the product to the seller.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> If small sharp cuticle clippers are important, get the best.</li>
    <li> In fine shape works as described.</li>
    <li> These cuticle nippers were not sharp. Not stable in your hand. The metal felt thin. Overall poor quality. I returned them.</li>
    <li> I like how they are willing to back it with a lifetime warranty and to me that speaks of the quality f the product. It is a little more expensive than most but the last two we bought were cheep and they were damaged really easily. I am a happy customer so far and I hope I will be for a long time.</li>
    <li> Avoid at all costs...the product arrived late...the package was opened. Finding a new pair of nippers opened..no&lt;br /&gt;invoice...the nippers were not as advertised....looked like a pair I would find at the dollar store...I would Never never never&lt;br /&gt;order anything from Toilet Tree Products</li>
    <li> After going through and throwing away multiple Revlon Cuticle Nippers (they get dull after just a few months) I decided to try a more expensive pair.&lt;br /&gt;Other than being a little stiff, which I assume will loosen up a bit with use - these are great.&lt;br /&gt;I am completely happy with this purchase and am happy this company offers a lifetime replacement guaranteed.</li>
    <li> I wanted to replace the clipper my father had given me 45 years ago and which had finally begun to dull. They were 5.5 inches long which made them easy to handle.  Reading the fine print I discovered that many clippers that looked identical in the pictures (even some also by Tioletrees and packaged similarly) were much smaller.  Having tried to use such appliances, I knew they were hard manipulate in my palm while clipping toenails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old clippers had a cutting edge at bearly right angles to the handle.  These come out fairly straight so that the edge was in line with the handle. For me, that difference does not seem to matter.  The clippers have a polished finish on the jaw section and a brushed finish on the handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I read the reviews I also discovered that many people complained of receiving clippers that would not clip.  These are the right size and clip cleanly leaving a smooth-edged nail. It&#x27;s too soon to know if the steel is high quality and will remain sharp.  However, since they are guaranteed for life, I hope the steel will stay sharp as long as my old ones. If they do, I will be 111 when they finally dull.  I&#x27;m hoping that&#x27;s long enough to get me through this lifetime.</li>
    <li> I love ToiletTree products. They are sharp and good quality. I had to get used to using it,  as it requires more pressure than my previous cuticle nippers. But now I absolutely love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using them for 2 years, the little leg that makes nippers \\&quot;move\\&quot; broke. I sent this product back to manufacturer and after paying postage (just few bucks), I got a pair of new ones. Nice customer service.</li>
    <li> These Nippers are solid sturdy feeling clippers. They make clean precise cuts and you cant beat that warranty! In my opinion worth every penny.</li>
    <li> All too often I&#x27;ve gotten nippers or tweezers and they didn&#x27;t close right and in the case of nippers, not being sharp enough.  These are good.  I will be purchasing another pair as a gift.</li>
    <li> I bought these because the description and a review mentioned hang nails.  They work extremely well.  I am able to cut the hang nails without any problems.  They are easy to use.</li>
    <li> The nipper is sharp, comfortable to hold in your hand and appears to be of good quality.  It has a life time warrantee which is wonderful, however the packaging did not include a guarantee or a return address for sharpening.</li>
    <li> Love love these...great product....highly recommend this product.....worth the price...well made..very sharp...one of the best that I ever purchased. ....perfect for professional use</li>
    <li> I love these nippers, they are tiny enough to get to the smallest hangnail, and sharp enough to nip it with very little pressure.  This nipper is just what I was looking for, and is a top quality product.  The seller packaged it to protect it in shipment and shipped it promptly.  Great product from a good seller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to get all excited about cuticle scissors. I don&#x27;t need them that often but the old ones i had couldn&#x27;t cut butter and these are quite sharp. I was a bit confused by the 1/4 or 1/2 thing. These work perfectly. Hopefully the sharpness will last a really long time</li>
    <li> A good manicure tool with a nice feel in the hand.  It&#x27;s nice that the company&#x27;s customer service is in the USA and easily contacted if a problem should arise.</li>
    <li> After having the same nippers for the last 30 years, I figured it was time for a new pair. I&#x27;ve purchased others, but ended up returning them since they didn&#x27;t work. This cuticle nipper is fantastic. It works great and I&#x27;m happy to finally be able to cut my cuticles once again, instead of tearing them.</li>
    <li> We love the lifetime guarantee, and they are gentle and precise on our cuticles. Thank you for making such a great product! Love them!</li>
    <li> This cuticle clipper is excellent. I have had so many over the years (drug store kind-cheaper but when you throw them out every year because they are dull, way more expensive than this product). I highly recommend this item because it feels sturdy, cuts beautifully, has an excellent warranty, and is professional quality.</li>
    <li> These are the worst cuticle cutters I have ever bought.  I should have read the 1-star reviews more carefully before I wasted my money buying this piece of absolute junk.</li>
    <li> These nippers were a great disappointment.  They were not sharp and would not cut a cuticle even after the second or third try. You would think that a lifetime replacement item would at least work great in the beginning.</li>
