      <li>Younger as well :)</li>
      <li>I love the cream, but since my cataract surgery with the resultant dry-eye syndrome, this lotion is the ONLY thing I can use on my face that doesn&#x27;t migrate up into my eyes from below the cheek bones.  </li>
      <li>I first tried MD Forte about 9 years ago.</li>
      <li>Also,  both my daughters age 32 and 34 have started using it with positive results.</li>

      <li>It helps keep my stubborn skin clear.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using III for at least 10 or more years.  </li>
      <li>Since I have sensitive, congested adult skin, my dermatologist suggested this brand.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good stuff exfoliates better than Retin-A. After continual use, your skin will glow like a 20-year-old! I worked at a Plastic Surgery Center &amp; the MD Forte line, although an old line, WORKS!</li>
    <li> Moisturizers are only as good as they can penetrate into your skin.  MD Forte Facial Lotion prepares your skin by opening your pores to allow the moisturizers to soak in and do their job!  A bit of an additional expense, but well worth the benefits!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, yet seems to help with skin clarity and tone.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me.  Using the cleanser provides results of a clean face without any residue and residual film.  The addition of the glycolic acid provides an improved glow to my face!</li>
    <li> I love this.  It helps keep my stubborn skin clear.  I&#x27;ve been using glycolic acid peel and cleanser for years.  This is more gentle than a peel so I don&#x27;t have to deal with that awful flaking (who seriously has time to hide out at home waiting for the face to stop peeling like a zombie?).  Its effect is subtle yet very real.  If I start peeling I just stop using it for a couple days and the peels stops within a day.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for year&#x27;s and it&#x27;s never failed me!  Keeps my skin smooth and very clean.  Younger as well :)</li>
    <li> I have use this facial lotion and the MD Forte products for the last 25 years. I am always complimented on how youthful my skin looks. I am so sad that Allergan stopped producing this product in December 2012.  I will, however, try their replacement line called Vivite.</li>
    <li> The formula seems different than before. It is more liquid-based and I don&#x27;t think the glycolic is as strong. I have been a fan of MD Forte for years, but doubt I&#x27;ll continue.</li>
    <li> I first tried MD Forte about 9 years ago. I was tired of adult acne and at the age of 32 I decided to go to a dermatologist. It took her about 1 minute to tell me what my problem was (I can&#x27;t remember the term, but it was basically my skin didn&#x27;t &#x27;turn over&#x27; or &#x27;shed&#x27; skin cells very well).&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t bat an eye while she recommended MD Forte II; cleanser, lotion and Sun screen. Within a week of using it morning and night, my acne began to dry up and fall away!!! AND it didn&#x27;t make my skin dry or flaky. In fact it began to return to the skin of my youth, with a healthy glow, and makeup went on perfectly. After one month she moved me up to level III, the most glycolic acid, at 20%.  After 2 months my skins was beautiful!! I was no longer embarrassed to be seen by my family or friends without makeup on!&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I&#x27;ve tried less expensive solutions, but I ALWAYS come back to MD forte III!!! I&#x27;ll never go back to anything else now!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon, for carrying MD Forte products!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy girl in Washington</li>
    <li> The reason I bought this product was because I had read that glycolic acid was an important ingredient in minimizing the look of wrinkles.  Perhaps I have not used it correctly (I generally apply at least once a day, sometimes twice &amp; I&#x27;ve used it for a little over two weeks) but I see not an iota of difference.  Maybe more time is needed. I certainly don&#x27;t expect time to be reversed and I didn&#x27;t have big expectations but I see no changes to report....nothing negative, nothing positive.  I&#x27;m still using it and will until it is gone but I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this particular product again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, purchasing it from an unreliable source. I am happy to find it is so easy to get it this way.</li>
    <li> Too bad it&#x27;s been discontinued</li>
    <li> Stuff is amazing, skin is clear n smooth!</li>
    <li> I have received many compliments on how smooth and wrinkle free my almost 68 year skin is.  MD Forte has helped quite a bit with the maintenance and upkeep. Also,  both my daughters age 32 and 34 have started using it with positive results.</li>
    <li> Great product! Does not make your face break out. Good for minimizing pores.</li>
    <li> Although I am tempted to buy all things MD Forte (as they are supposedly discontinuing this line and will go to Vivite), this lotion is replacing for me the MD Forte III facial cream.  I love the cream, but since my cataract surgery with the resultant dry-eye syndrome, this lotion is the ONLY thing I can use on my face that doesn&#x27;t migrate up into my eyes from below the cheek bones.  When using the lotion I feel as if I am putting water on my face instead of a moisturizing cream and my wrinkles can attest to that.  I have tried the Vivite and it makes my eyes so bloodshot that I fear I am allergic to it.  So, until I can find something more effective....this is the lotion for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years on my T-zone and on the skin just *beneath* my under-eye-circles where my pores get huge.  I use it under the MD Forte Cream 3. Since I have sensitive, congested adult skin, my dermatologist suggested this brand. Start out at level 1 and move up to a 2 or 3, as needed.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend to buy anything form Yolo Beauty. It was the first time I used them and the product is fake! It arrived very fast (due to Amazon Prime) but it was without original packaging The box was wrapped in plastic with scotch tape over it. There was at least 1 inch of product missing on the bottle. I opened it and the smell was like in the genuine product so I squeezed a little out but it was way too thin! I´ve been using this product for years and really like it )great for blackheads, acne and wrinkles) but please do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I had some blemish problems, which are gone from using their products. I would not be without them.</li>
    <li> great, but anyone starting to use this product should with #1 than #2 before going to #3.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and normally buy it from the dermatologist. It was a great price savings buying it through this site.</li>
    <li> My mom swears by it and she&#x27;s been using for years.  She&#x27;s 75 and looks 60.  I don&#x27;t find much difference in whatever I use but I keep using this anyway.  It&#x27;s not too sensitive for my skin at all</li>
    <li> Wish this was still being made!</li>
    <li> This is a delivery system for alpha hydroxy for individuals who have used it before and whose skin is accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as dramatic as a surgical peel, but a definite help in evening skin tone and texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We may not be able to turn back the clock, but we can try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I have used M.D. Forte Facial Lotion for many years and love the product.  Has definately helped my skin look fresher and younger.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I expected. My only concern was that it was delivered to the wrong address, and the package(the envelope) was opened and labeled \\&quot;sent to wrong address and opened\\&quot; but the product did not seem to be opened itself, so I did not return it, but it did concern me.&lt;br /&gt;I have been happy with the glycolic lotion. I use it according to my dermatologists instructions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MD Forte products for years with great results!!! First had to go to my dermatologist; now able to get it online :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it is great</li>
    <li> This is 30% glycolic acid. It keeps my skin looking great. It penetrated through the skin better then the cream and better then any product I have used. This product was replaced or renamed Vivte .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this in the past and had great results.  Not so with this purchase.  It does nothing.  Bad batch or new formula.  I&#x27;ll not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s never disappointed.  I attribute my youthful appearance to glycolic acid and it&#x27;s a must have.  I&#x27;m 44 and could pass for my late twenties, early thirties.  I&#x27;ve been using glycolic acid since I was 19 after it was recommended by my dermatologist to reduce acne scars.  I&#x27;ve used M.D. Forte Facial Lotion I and II before working my way up to III.  I&#x27;ve been using III for at least 10 or more years.  Highly recommended to start low and work your way up in regards to concentration.  If it&#x27;s too strong just dilute by adding a moisturizing lotion in the palm of your hand with a pea sized drop of glycolic acid, mix, and apply.  Do not apply to broken or irritated skin and use sunscreen daily.</li>
