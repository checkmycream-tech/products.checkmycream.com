      <li>this is really good quality like the brush guard at first i was gonna buy from the brush guard</li>

      <li>So make sure you fit the correct size.</li>
      <li>It keeps the brushes in shape and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>and this is just perfect because all the water will drip down away from the glue area in the brush when I put in my makeup cup/container brush</li>
      <li>Along with the fact that if you place your brushes facing down without gaurds, you&#x27;re having your brushes get out of its perfect shape.</li>
      <li>Super love.</li>
      <li>Clean with dish soap and olive oil to clean and refresh the brush heads!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also a bit week and fray very easily, for me this happened upon the first use with some of them.</li>
      <li>free to ask a question.</li>
      <li>free to ask a question.</li>
      <li>Now that explains how much i love them right?</li>
      <li>I would get this set first to see how these guards fit on your brushes, so you will know which size to get if you order more of one size.</li>
      <li>totally worth it to keep your brushes shaped and protected!</li>
      <li>Travel friendly</li>
      <li>They stretch really nicely and fit over a variety of my brushes (I have many different shapes and sizes).</li>
      <li>I clean my brushes daily/weekly</li>
      <li>this really protects the bristles on your brush and most importantly, keeps them clean inside your brush make-up kit and protects them from getting ruined by the zipper.</li>
      <li>It makes it much easier to clean my brushes, so I clean them more often than I ever have before.</li>
      <li>Some of my makeup brushes require special handling after washing.  </li>
      <li>These helped them straighten right up!</li>
      <li>I should have saved myself that dollar something and shelled out the cash for these right from the start!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great for smaller lip/eyeshadow/eyeliner brushes, but if you have very pricey, high quality blush/foundation/powder brushes, I&#x27;d recommend going with better quality brush guards!</li>
      <li>great variety to fit everything from  my blush brushes down to my lip brush.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly after I ordered.</li>
      <li>The variety pack provides a nice assortment of sizes that fit the different make-up brushes I have.</li>
      <li>Great for travel, so much safer to leave my brushes out after washing them, which I regularly do anyway, but no reason to hesitate with these protectors in the picture!</li>
      <li>Really amazing and cheap, washed my brushes and put to dry and everything worked!</li>
      <li>Shadow/liner brush guard fits most of the brushes in the eye starter set, although it is too large for the pixel-point liner brush (doesn&#x27;t really shape it at</li>
      <li>reference as to how these guards fit on Real Techniques</li>
      <li>I wouldnt say they are necessarily worth $6...</li>
      <li>Wow, it does keep my brushes in tip top condition.  </li>
      <li>It kind of works for my purposes, but if you are looking for the smaller ones, or just a variety pack, get something else.</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>I will was my brushes, then put this on right after.</li>
      <li>They stretched to fit and held better.</li>
      <li>I am very confident that my brushes will last longer in my purse thanks to these guards.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Pretty much, these guards are functional and basic, and the size fit depends more on the brush handle size rather than the brush head size.</li>
      <li>Will purchase more in future.</li>
      <li>i feel if i hadnt gotten these my brushes whould most likely be all messed up</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After washing my make-up brushes, gentle removing excess water, shaping, and allowing to dry most of the way, I slide one of these brush guards on from the handle to the tip to keep the brush properly shaped and protected. I also use these if I am traveling because I don&#x27;t have a dedicated makeup bag and I don&#x27;t want the bristles to become misshapen or damaged. I would recommend, and plan to buy again.</li>
    <li> Saw these on youtube. Can&#x27;t believe I had treated my makeup brushes so badly before. These really help after I&#x27;ve cleaned them &amp; every day to keep brushes dust &amp; gunk-free.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a brush guard. It does what it says. I use it and it&#x27;s nice. Not much else to say about that. Also good price.</li>
    <li> Love these - wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive</li>
    <li> Good variety. Protects makeup brushes when traveling and is also useful in drying wet brushes after cleaning. Items arrived from Coastal Scents as described.</li>
    <li> I use these to help store my brushes while they dry. Because once you clean them you can put them up right, or flat on a surface since the water can go straight into the glue and cause your brush to not last long. Along with the fact that if you place your brushes facing down without gaurds, you&#x27;re having your brushes get out of its perfect shape. These brush gaurds are amazing, and helps dry my brushes while keeping them in perfect shape. </li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kicking myself for not getting these sooner. I apply my makeup on the go most days and I almost always end up either getting makeup smeared on the inside of my makeup bag or having the bristles all out of shape. This product is perfect for keeping the brush intact!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also perfect for after you clean your brushes - just put these on them and let them dry upside down in a cup. It preserves the shape while making sure they dry properly.</li>
    <li> These things are completely irreplaceable. If you don&#x27;t already own a set then you need to get it, now. If you do then you already know what I am talking about. They have actually fixed some of my old splayed brushes (clean with soap and water mixed with olive oil or brush cleaner, slip them on, then leave them alone for a few days brush side down in a glass) They do what they say and make cleaning your brushes a snap. My only problem is one brush that I can&#x27;t put it on because of the shape of it, but that&#x27;s the brushes fault really. (It has a pencil sharpener on one end, weird brush but I adore it.) Other than that my only regret is I didn&#x27;t buy them sooner.</li>
    <li> Well, maybe it is just my luck, but it&#x27;s just not as advertised - the brush guards are EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE!  It even comes with a drawing of a few different sizes and description on which brush they should go, but they are just the same, large size...  Also, the picture shows 5 guards, and the actual pack had just 4...  It kind of works for my purposes, but if you are looking for the smaller ones, or just a variety pack, get something else.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best things for your brushes. Really works to reshape while drying. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Any girl who has a stash of makeup brushes needs these. They ensure that your brushes maintain their shape always.</li>
    <li> I purchased several sets of these in a variety of sizes. I have two needs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Vanity top storage: protection from dust and grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Travel: protection from smooshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will just go with a watercolor brush holder in the future. [[ASIN:B004F83ZY6 Brush &amp; Tool Holder up to 15\\&quot;]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might try on a couple of my watercolor brushes. Have not yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use to dry brushes after washing, with one exception. Larger brushes would take too long to dry and could develop mildew or otherwise damage ferule, glue, etc. Dry brushes on their side. If you have a way to hang them upside down (I don&#x27;t) then you can do that. I like hanging them over the edge of the table if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanity top storage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:works well. I live in a desert with high winds and keeping surfaces clean is, well, impossible. Obviously the very tips will still get grit and dust, but there is less over-all exposure. CON: no  more pretty display of brushes and harder to tell which one to grab. 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO, most traveled well. 4 stars. MAJOR CON: But the ones I packed in a zip pocket, with space for a things to move around, allowed the cover to push back against the brush hairs and deform my expensive brushes. I had to wash and reshape them by hand and the hairs were very reluctant to be re-shaped. It may have broken the hairs. The ones in individual brush pockets in my make up bag did fine, but they would have anyway. THIS IS THE POINT OF THE PRODUCT AND IT DOES NOT MEET ITS PURPOSE. 1 star. (zero stars.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other&lt;br /&gt;Brushes will dry correctly when shaped by hand or even just tapped out. Once dry or nearly so, these performed very well on re-shaping a very old, large, fluffy, high capacity, high quality water color brush that I use to dust off any loose powder, blusher, shadow as a last step after a full make-up job. Not for blending. It is looking lovely, tho I am sure it will return to it&#x27;s former state once used a few times. It was dry when I put it in and left it for two weeks. 4 stars for shaping up an old brush.  If it stays shaped up for six months, then it would be 5 stars, don&#x27;t know yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I used to use my older brushes for travel and my newer ones for home, but now traveling alot and missed my brushes. That YouTube star, David Goss Makeup Artist, has ruined me on brushes! Now must have nothing but the best.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to get a watercolor brush carrier, the folding kind, like the Alvin Prestige Brush &amp; Tool Holder  [[ASIN:B004F83ZY6 Brush &amp; Tool Holder up to 15\\&quot;]]. They pack flat, but don&#x27;t store wet brushes in them, except for very short time (from studio to home).Based on my experience with watercolor brushes,  don&#x27;t use a canvas or bamboo holder to roll brushes together against each other, but keep each one separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask a question. Love to hear if they solved a problem for you. This stuff costs the company that packages them about a buck for miles of this tubing, which they cut, label, package and ship. But the industrial versions I see wholesale are much larger, haven&#x27;t found a source for smaller diameters.former state once used a few times.

    <li> I bought this product because my black, natural hair brushes were starting to look bad. These helped them straighten right up! I will was my brushes, then put this on right after. Once dry, I will take them off and my brushes look and feel like new! No more rough bristles! :)</li>
    <li> These brush covers are such a great find! They stretch really nicely and fit over a variety of my brushes (I have many different shapes and sizes). I bought these to use for brushes that will go in my purse so that they do not get ruined. I am very confident that my brushes will last longer in my purse thanks to these guards.  I am pleasently surprised at how sturdy these brush guards are; each one is tight-knit yet so stretchy! I found that I needed to work a couple of my larger-handled brushes into the guard before they slid through. But once I got the base of the handle into the guard, it fit perfectly. I plan to buy another variety pack.</li>
    <li> These shape the brushes like they&#x27;re meant to, whether it&#x27;s during the drying process of cleaning brushes or traveling with them. There&#x27;s nothing phenomenal or horrible about these brush guards, although they are overpriced (it&#x27;s just plastic woven in a way that allows expansion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do extend drying time, so I just leave them on the brushes that need shaping for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thumbnail is slightly misleading; there are 6 brush guards in this set, not 5. The set comes with:&lt;br /&gt;- 1 powder brush guard&lt;br /&gt;- 2 foundation brush guards&lt;br /&gt;- 2 blush brush guards&lt;br /&gt;- 1 shadow/liner guard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference as to how these guards fit on Real Techniques brushes:&lt;br /&gt;- Powder brush guard fits the powder brush perfectly&lt;br /&gt;- Foundation brush guard fits the blush brush perfectly and the stippling brush well&lt;br /&gt;- Blush brush guard fits the setting brush and deluxe crease brush&lt;br /&gt;- Shadow/liner brush guard fits most of the brushes in the eye starter set, although it is too large for the pixel-point liner brush (doesn&#x27;t really shape it at all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much, these guards are functional and basic, and the size fit depends more on the brush handle size rather than the brush head size. I would get this set first to see how these guards fit on your brushes, so you will know which size to get if you order more of one size.</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It keeps the brushes in shape and it&#x27;s easy to use. However, what&#x27;s going on with those edges?! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s burnt plastic or glue, but all of them have really rough edges. It can pull on the brushes when you put it on and when you take it off... Other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Great product but i can use it, for the purpose that its suppose to be use, because this things moves with the time and the bristles fold to the backside of the brush and then you can your brush with some bristles downsized, awful, so i use them to dry my brushes after i wash them, putting them upside down.</li>
    <li> Bought these along with the Coastal Scents 12-piece brush set and they work great. I&#x27;ve used them several times now and this variety pack fits mostly all of the brushes that I bought. One downside is that they are not as snug as I expected them to be with my brushes, but since they work well in drying and storing them, and not messing up the bristles, I guess it evens it out! Would recommend this with their Coastal Scents brushes, but also any brushes you have.</li>
    <li> Super love. While drying - bristles dry in perfect shape as per stated in description. However once it&#x27;s expanded, it&#x27;s loose. So make sure you fit the correct size.</li>
    <li> Great way to protect your brushes. the biggest one fits a kabuki brush they midsize ones are perfect for blush, bronzer and foundation they small one fits great for eyeshadow brushes and the very thin one is perfect for eyeliner brushes.</li>
    <li> these are seriously a great invention, and the variety pack is fantastic. Great for travel, so much safer to leave my brushes out after washing them, which I regularly do anyway, but no reason to hesitate with these protectors in the picture!</li>
    <li> I hate cleaning my brushes. These are useful, but my brushes take forever to dry in them. Not completely necessary.</li>
    <li> love this my brushes kept there shape</li>
    <li> As another reviewer pointed out, the covers will shift on the brush, kinking the outer hairs/fibers of bigger brushes and holding them at weird angles. Similarly, I can&#x27;t help but feel like the plastic ends will begin to unravel shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do what they say they&#x27;ll do - just make sure you have a case that holds your brushes stationary so you won&#x27;t encounter the shifting problem. They&#x27;re great for smaller lip/eyeshadow/eyeliner brushes, but if you have very pricey, high quality blush/foundation/powder brushes, I&#x27;d recommend going with better quality brush guards!</li>
    <li> Very good product. To be honest, I cant tell the difference from this vs the original Brush Guards. Because my brush collection is growing, I will definitely keep buying more.</li>
    <li> I like this especially for my big brushed like face, bush and bronzer brushes cause I feel they need the most protecting. I have the small ones too but don&#x27;t use them much.&lt;br /&gt;Now I currently have 3 sets of the variety and they are still holding up really well after a few years.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I got this!</li>
    <li> Some of my makeup brushes require special handling after washing.  The manufacturer suggested I buy a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; to dry them, that cost $40!  Basically it was a cover like these ones.  So, I decided to try this instead and they work well.  Not only that, now I use them to protect the brushes when I travel and it is perfect.  The only bad thing is this pack did not have more than 2 sizes.  Would have preferred to have several sizes.  Nice nonetheless</li>
    <li> great variety to fit everything from  my blush brushes down to my lip brush. Only qualm is it doesn&#x27;t come with a kabuki brush size guard and will have to buy it seperate</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great for drying your makeup brushes without causing damage to them.  Would highly recommend you invest in this if you want to take care of your makeup brushes</li>
    <li> They do their job. I wouldnt say they are necessarily worth $6... but they do keep the dust and such off the the brushes</li>
    <li> These work great and I have no complaints. If you live somewhere humid, the inside of your brushes may have trouble drying though when you use these. Arrived quickly after I ordered.</li>
    <li> I would give this 3.5 stars. It works well and the sizes are good. I use this after cleaning my makeup brushes so that the water remaining in the brush doesn&#x27;t get to the glue.</li>
    <li> Great product.I did not realize how much I needed this. It is durable and much more hygenic way to protect my brushes</li>
    <li> this is really good quality like the brush guard at first i was gonna buy from the brush guard but they did not ship where i was living so i dont know what to do my brushes are going to be ruined but thank god they came to the rescue :) i bought these and the shadow/liner pack.&lt;br /&gt;check this out if you cant by from thebrushguard&lt;br /&gt;bye and thank you coastal scents :)</li>
    <li> It comes handy when cleaning brushes. I don&#x27;t have any powder brush that is big enough to use the kabuki brush guard though. It&#x27;s a bit too big for all my brushes. It&#x27;s good they offer super saver free shipping.</li>
    <li> love love love these, i bought 4 sets and they are just amazing. i feel if i hadnt gotten these my brushes whould most likely be all messed up so this product is beyond amazing and i think any girl or guy that does makeup should have these for their brushes</li>
    <li> My girfriend loves these so much.  She has gone from never washing her brushes due to the time and frustration waiting for them to dry, to washing them weekly!  They have worked great!  Clean with dish soap and olive oil to clean and refresh the brush heads!</li>
    <li> Does its job and like some of the other reviewers who may have stated, sometimes the brush is too heavy and will push the brush down. Leading the hairs on the brush to stick out through the holes on the guard. As long as you&#x27;re careful of the weight, works as promised.</li>
    <li> I clean my brushes daily/weekly and I need something to hold my brushes upside down and this is just perfect because all the water will drip down away from the glue area in the brush when I put in my makeup cup/container brush</li>
    <li> I finally gave in and purchased these costal scent protectors after I bought some generic dollar something ones that were just terrible.  I should have saved myself that dollar something and shelled out the cash for these right from the start!</li>
    <li> My brushes cant live without it! i bought one pack at first to try it out and now i bought 4 of them. Now that explains how much i love them right? this really protects the bristles on your brush and most importantly, keeps them clean inside your brush make-up kit and protects them from getting ruined by the zipper. This is a must have most especially if you have those expensive make-up brushes.</li>
    <li> bought this kit, and I was surprised. Really amazing and cheap, washed my brushes and put to dry and everything worked! recommend this productive for everyone.</li>
    <li> Never thought I needed these until I stumbled across them! Keeps my brushes soft and intact, especially when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Also great for washing and drying!</li>
    <li> Everything came so fast, and the quality is superb! I believe that this beauty &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; is a good investment for yourself.</li>
    <li> totally worth it to keep your brushes shaped and protected! have ordered multiple times so i have enough for all my brushes!</li>
    <li> This product saves my brushes and comes in a variety of sizes that suits all the brushes. Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> This type of product was referenced in a blog and decided to give it a try.  Wow, it does keep my brushes in tip top condition.  It makes it much easier to clean my brushes, so I clean them more often than I ever have before.</li>
    <li> I primarily took away two stars because the guards move a little, in my case downward. If I wasn&#x27;t mindful of that they could have ruined the hair fibers on my brush, so handle with care. They&#x27;re also a bit week and fray very easily, for me this happened upon the first use with some of them. So placing the upside down for drying purposes? No. Lean them against something.The trick for me I found was to use a size down on the brushes. They stretched to fit and held better. For example, I used a medium guard on some of my larger brushes.</li>
    <li> The only reason this does not get a 5 star rating is the largest brush guard is not big enough for real techniques or sigma brushes.</li>
    <li> This one is new for you if you, like me, care about your brushes and want to keep them clean, protected, and in perfect shape. Coastal Scents The Brush Guard is just the perfect thing to achieve all those goals. I think this is just genius. Not only these light guards are protecting your brushes from dust, they are good while drying, to keep the brushes in perfect shape, they are easy and convenient to use, brushes are protected in storage, and easy to take to travel. I liked the The Brush Guard Company site where you can buy a brush cleaning kit for $19.95. But if you want you can only buy Coastal Scents Brush Purifier, it&#x27;s $4.95 on Amazon. I am getting one for myself.</li>
    <li> the only brush guards that are worth it!</li>
    <li> Recommend, have held up well. Great for drying cleaned brushes to hold the shapes. Or to store your expensive brushes. Will purchase more in future.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping my brushes in the proper shape while drying after cleaning them. The variety pack provides a nice assortment of sizes that fit the different make-up brushes I have. The brush guards really help ease the drying process - highly recommend to anyone using make-up brushes on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> It dries my brushes without contracting dust. Travel friendly and I use them for all my brushes. Who ever created this is awsome!</li>
    <li> They do what they are supposed to do. I tried to make mine stretch for my entire brush collection by cutting some of them in half. Don&#x27;t do it. They frayed and I had to throw a couple away. If you have more brushes than there are covers, just buy a 2nd set. They work well and I love how my brushes dry.</li>
    <li> I ordered another pack to cover all my beautiful brushes in between uses, and after shampooing.  This variety pack is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> keeps brushes in good condition! After cleaning my brushes, i like to leave them upright in a jar, and I&#x27;ve noticed these definitely help dry them nicely and keep their shape.</li>
