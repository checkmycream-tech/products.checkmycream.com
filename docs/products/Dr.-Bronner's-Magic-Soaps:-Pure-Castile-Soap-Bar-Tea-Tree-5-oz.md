      <li>Some people don&#x27;t like the aroma of melaleuca, but I find it rather pleasant.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best soap ever. I have senstive and acne proned skin. Even the expensive products doesn&#x27;t work on my skin the way this product did. And ever since I started using this soap, my skin is smoother and clear. I haven&#x27;t had acne problems ever since. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 3 years now.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world.</li>
    <li> Great soap, not allergic reactions and does the job.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers very good. My skin feels great after I shower using this soap. It lasts quite a while and doesn&#x27;t break up like other soaps. I plan on continuing to purchase this item in the future and would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I like that I can identify and pronounce all of the ingredients, but more importantly, it leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
    <li> Big Bronner fan and this is one of our stand-bys.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually using the Tea Tree bar as a face wash as I heard it can help clear up problematic skin. I&#x27;ve tried sooooo many things in the past and I&#x27;m usually let down. The only things that have worked for me are full of nasty chemicals that are doing more harm than good. This bar is amazing! I don&#x27;t find it to be drying at all and my skin started showing a noticeable improvement after a week of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell is concerned, I personally love the smell of tea tree so i don&#x27;t find it offensive in the least. I love to breathe it in when I wash my face. That being said, the scent is very mild so even if you weren&#x27;t the biggest fan of tea tree  I don&#x27;t think it would be bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the lavender bar as a hand soap and recently purchased the baby mild liquid for all other uses. My goal is to replace all our cleaning products with either Dr. Bronner&#x27;s or natural alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Has a strong offensive smell. Reminds me of diesel fuel.</li>
    <li> Great soap that is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like man.  I am a man.  I smell good.</li>
    <li> Love this soap..keeps my skin from drying up.</li>
    <li> The bars are a good size, do  not melt easily. The scent is very mild. The tea tree oil keeps the skin soft and supple.  After using it for showering, I had an appointment for a massage. My therapist stated she noted a difference in my skin turgor, stating my skin was softer and required less massage lotion than usual.  This soap lathers nicely and rinses easily. I have extremely sensitive skin. No issues with this soap at all.</li>
    <li> I like this soap a lot but I just can&#x27;t justify the extra cost as compared to regular Dove or something like that.</li>
    <li> I have used Dr. Bronners for years.  It smells great and suds up well in hard water. As always Amazon provides great service and shipping.</li>
    <li> This tea tree soap is a good back up for my Dr Bronner liquid.  I like the feel and get extra clean using it.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser ! I love it !</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My face, arms and legs have never looked better! For realsies.</li>
    <li> Doctor Bronners soap is my favorite. This bar with Tea Tree Oil in it is extra good , as Tea Tree Oil is an antifungal. I need that especially at public swimming pools.</li>
    <li> I buy this tea tree soap because of its antibacterial and anti fungal properties.&lt;br /&gt;Good for travel. I reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I bought 6 soaps for my brother and I during our 3 weeks trip in Peru, thinking it will not last for long (were using it for everything from hair and body to teeth).&lt;br /&gt;But finally, we only used half of one for two persons.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, during this trip, because of the trek and everything, we were probably taking less than 1 shower every days in average... And we finally didn&#x27;t used it for laundry.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, works great.</li>
    <li> I used this for my home-made laundry detergent.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> My son has a skin condition and I also have sensitive skin.  This All-One Hemp Tea Tree 5 ounce Castile Soap helps both of us.</li>
    <li> This is my second order. My hubby loves the soap and I love the price and the 2 day delivery with PRIME. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast shipping. Its not that bad of a soap bar. All natural.</li>
    <li> When you use a soap saver these soaps last a long, long time.</li>
    <li> I use this soap as a body and face cleanser.  Imagine that, using a soap to wash your face! I can use this on my face without any dryness whatsoever.  It works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked, cannot go back to brand name soap</li>
    <li> I purchase this soap all the time glad I found it in bulk</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over a year. I have tried the rose, but prefer the Tea Tree. The Tea Tree soap is a light, refreshing soap that not only gets you clean, but doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Tea Tree compound is known for it&#x27;s healing effects (I am seeing more Tea Tree compounds in other personal care products, like hair oil). It does keep my skin clean and soft. It is also nice to have a natural product that works just as well or better than store brands. I have had some minor cuts seem to heal faster using this soap and first aid product. It doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate skin as some other soaps do. I have used both the liquid and bar soap and personally prefer the bar soap. I highly recommend this product. It is also a fair trade product made here in the USA, always a big plus!</li>
    <li> The Tea Tree version of this soap does wonders for my skin when I have any acne breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this soap has been a great find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in addition I love the fact the soap never leaves a residue regardless of how soft or hard the water is.</li>
    <li> I love tea tree oils so this soap was perfect for me.</li>
    <li> love the tea tree and lavender bars of soap from this brand!</li>
    <li> my 7-year old has athletes foot that the pediatrician refuses to treat - he insists that a 7-year old *can&#x27;t* get athletes foot. so after some research, i found that tea tree oil can treat athletes foot. my son has been using this for about 3 weeks and it is almost all cleared up! no prescriptions, no over the counter topical creams/sprays/powders, no chemicals. i&#x27;m thrilled with this soap!</li>
    <li> I used to buy this same soap in the liquid form in a big bottle which I found overtly awkward.  This soap has the same amazing properties except in bar form.  I use the tea tree oil soap because I work in a medical clinic and I like the mild astringent properties of tea tree oil without having to use something so abrasive as an antibacterial additive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Dr. Bronner was a bit eccentric and the packaging looks like it was possibly taken from a schizophrenic&#x27;s street sign.  That aside the soap is amazing.  It is fair trade, pure castile and each bar lasts a long time.  FYI &amp;#34;pure-castile&amp;#34; means that a soap is made without any animal tallow and uses vegetable fats only.  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps use mostly coconut and olive oil.</li>
    <li> This soap works well to calm my skin, but the price is kind of steep. I will purchase again only because I have not found another one that gives me results.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap.  I love that it&#x27;s fair-trade and no animal testing.  The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming and the soap is non-drying.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, no bar soap is completely hydrating. This stuff clear well, rinses easily &amp; is basically all organic. It doesn&#x27;t dry me out that bad and you can use it for your whole body. Buy the different scents for the particular reason or problem your having, tea tree is antibacterial, lavender is calming, eucalyptus helps with the bugs, ect.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try Dr Bronner soaps ever since I kept seeing them at Trader Joe&#x27;s and whole foods listed with natural and organic as well as fair trade ingredients and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m disappointed. I bought mine at a small gourmet market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The block of soap is large and lathers decently to very well.  It doesn&#x27;t soften easily so it will last a long time.  The first thing that hits you as you bathe is its HIGHLY aromatic tea tree oil fragrance, very mediciny and botanical.  After washing with it, especially to clean my feet, underarms and other usual odor-encased places free of bacteria &amp; fungi,  I definitely felt clean and fresh-smelling.  It definitely scented my whole bathroom up.  I did NOT feel the tight itchy feeling on my body that I would feel when using cheap synthetic toxic mainstream soaps.  The package doesn&#x27;t look elegant nor beautiful, but what it lacks in appearance is made up for in function and great value for the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely great for aromatherapy, great for those who really want to clean and not just put lather &amp; bubbles &amp; aroma on their body, great for those wanting organic products, great for people with sensitive skin, and great as an everyday soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE July 5, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;I LOVED this soap&#x27;s strong botanical fragrance and rich lather and cleansing ability so much such that I kept on using it EVERY opportunity, even two or three times in ONE bathing!!  It&#x27;s dwindled down to a tiny sliver so I&#x27;ve bought more since it&#x27;s EXCELLENT for those odorous places on your body, especially after a long hot tired day smelling and sweating!</li>
    <li> Great cleansing bar, but a bit pricey. Does a great job and my skin/body feels clean</li>
    <li> This is the greatest soap ever. My son has eczema and my husband has psoriasis. This soap does not dry the skin and is gentle enough to use on my face. We still lotion up after showering but this soap rinses off with no filmy residue. It is awesome!</li>
    <li> A great soap.  I have, also, used the peppermint. These products are wonderful.</li>
    <li> My skin burns if I dont use soap like this, this stuff is awesome. Good solid bath soap worth it.</li>
    <li> Light, mild scent (actually smells like soap, which I love). Lasts a good while. Recommended.</li>
    <li> A classic. Have been using it for ages, both face and body. Great if you have oily or blemish prone skin. But don&#x27;t use it on your face every day cause it might leave your skin too dry. I also used to wash my hair with it, it was amazing for the scalp, the roots had so much volume I would always get compliments for my hair on those days, but it dried out the ends severely so had to switch to a shampoo.</li>
    <li> With shipping costs I&#x27;m not sure this is cheaper than in stores, but easier to buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> If you love tea tree, this soap is for you. Very fragrant in tea tree, cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve also tried Bronner&#x27;s Castile liquid soap refill and I love that too. One thing to watch out for...because of its naturally thin consistency, it tends to squirt straight out of the dispenser and hit you in the shirt. I&#x27;ve learned to put my hand in front of it but my guests get hit in the shirt and think its a prank or something. Maybe it&#x27;s my dispenser? Not loosing a star for it! Great product</li>
    <li> great way to start the day .. revived, energetic. I like the hard soap &amp; combined with the liquid soap product for the shower ...</li>
    <li> CAUTION!!!!  BE CAREFUL with the liquid \\&quot;PURE-CASTILE SOAP.  My wife took an inadvertent direct squirt into eye that resulted in a serious chemical burn to her eye cornea, which is excruciatingly painful and has lasted for hours.  This is a very dangerous liquid!!  Emergency treatment was provided by our family doctor and Optomotrist.  We will know the extent of eye damage tomorrow and over the next few days.  WATCH OUT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love anything from Dr. Bronners!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have problem skin and like everyone else we have tried everything out there.I decided to try something natural,I have used Bronner soaps before so I knew the products were good,just wish we had started using it sooner.</li>
    <li> This soap smells nice and works well for soothing break-outs.  Very good quality and an excellent company that cares about their employees and the world.  Also, it lasts longer than I expected.</li>
    <li> Nice size bar. Good tea tree oil aroma. Well worth the price. Lathered up well and felt good. Easy company to deal with.</li>
    <li> The smell of tea tree oil is ...well overpowering.  But it is one of the best sanitizers and just fantastic to quell the bug bite problems. For sure non toxic tea tree oil is a better a option than most nasty commercial antibacterial soaps or poison based bug off products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not knowing what to do with six bars, I sliced a bar into chunks/slivers so I could slip them into my security cameras (insects and spiders love the heat of the camera and were a problem for years) and used them in place of moth balls to keep cats and ants away.  It worked quite well and lasts one long time outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indoors these bars also last one long time so get an air tight soap container to lock the smell and freshness in.  All of Dr Bonner&#x27;s soaps (liquid or bar) are some of the best soap and skin products you can find.  Try a couple and odds are you will recommend them as well.</li>
    <li> Before I tried it I had heard a lot of great things about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap but the price always kept me away.  Well Amazon has solved that problem.  I like that this product is cruelty-free.  It leaves you feeling clean and smelling great.  I was a little worried about my scalp drying out but that has not been a problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Just okay though.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin as bad as liquid body wash does, but it does seem to cause my neckline and face (when I was still using it on my face) to seem even more oily than usual.  I&#x27;m not saying it necessarily worsened my acne, but it definitely didn&#x27;t help it at all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use it daily and it helps keep my skin healthy, and fungus free. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! I use it in the shower for face and body. It has some natural oils in it so it is not drying, even on my face. (I love not having to spend a fortune on expensive facial cleansers anymore!) Tea tree oil has natural anti-bacterial properties and I have found that since I&#x27;ve started using this soap, my skin is more clear and I get fewer breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the smell - it is noticeable but not overpowering, and IMO, it smells (and, indeed, is!) more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; than Irish Spring or similar types of more commercial soaps. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I also really appreciate the way they treat their employees. In this day and age it is nice to see a company that both talks the talk AND walks the walk (fair labor practices, generous benefits and salaries for workers and not just the CEO!).</li>
    <li> I have back acne and spots of excema and this soap helps alot. Great product that last along time. Different smell but its growing on me. Its a woodsy manly smell but not bad after. Will not use anything else from now on. Blows dove away thats for sure.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased Sally Beauty Supply&#x27;s Generic Tea Tree Oil soap (compared to Paul Mitchell&#x27;s), and I liked the scent of that one better than the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s version.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are high quality, and are great.</li>
    <li> Helps keep the skin rashes calm and at bay.</li>
    <li> The best soap ever. I will NEVER go back to any store bought crap again. I love how clean I get and how good this smells. It got me through being pregnant in the summer in Florida and I always felt CLEAN. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the aroma of Tea Tree oil in many products, especially Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soap.</li>
    <li> I will never use another brand of soap again. I use these and grate them to make bodywash with essential oils and it is magical. My skin has never felt smoother or cleaner ever! Plus its all natural no harmful ingredients. Love love love it!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what possessed me to purchase the Tea Tree soap, but once you get past the initial unpleasant smell of Tea Tree this soap is great just like all the other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps.  Pure, no artificial ingredients.  These soaps do go down in size very quickly and are a bit &amp;#34;messier&amp;#34; than your average soap bar and of course, more expensive, but they are a pleasure to use, they are all natural, and they all smell great except for this one!  I really prefer the Almond soap.  Luckily the Tea Tree smell dissipates very rapidly as you wash with it.</li>
    <li> Love this soap.  I have been using it for about 6 months and my skin feels clean and soft. Little expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Have tried several Tea Tree soaps.  This works the best.</li>
    <li> Great soap!  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the smell at first, I bought what I thought was the most manly smell, but it&#x27;s really grown on me. It&#x27;s slightly astringent so it makes me a little tingly when I use it which was a little disconcerting at first but now I really enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap. I use it for my face but once my family started using it, they loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;It has been really good to me!</li>
    <li> This soap is great.  Suds up nicely.  Good for the skin, pleasant smell, not &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; scented so great for guys.</li>
    <li> we use this in the shower and it is a nice way to clean your privates with a natural product that is both naturally antibacterial and antifungal. the smell is awesome i think we will be using this for a very long time. an edit:  i have since purchased the liquid form of this to put in our foaming soap dispensers. we use this in the shower for the little ones and all around the house in the foaming pump. boy does the house smell good! update 4/1/16. this really is the best soap ever. i am using now to make my homemade laundry detergent based upon the infamous recipe and it does work. i have also switched over to citric acid and vinegar in the dishwasher and vinegar in the laundry for stinky items and to do the clean cycle instead of clorox</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner still makes a great soap. I have been fascinated with the labels for years but more importantly the soaps are great. Nice scent and lathery.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. A little goes a long way. Smells great if you like the tea tree smell from the melaleuca plant. Hemp based Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is eco friendly and very cleansing. I can see the dirt in the water while I shower!! Gross! Thank you for a great product for such a discount.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite soap!</li>
    <li> I have been using  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil soap for years now, I really like it.  I have sensitive skin and this works for me.</li>
    <li> It is fine to use for shaving my legs and armpits as a lather instead of using shaving cream which I don&#x27;t use. But it really irritates my lady parts. For this reason I will not use it again. I use it more for washing hands and leave it on the bathroom sink rather than use it for an all over body wash.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I love the scent of tea tree oil.  Also, one of the reviewers said this got rid of his/her &#x27;funky&#x27; smell.  Well, this does nothing for me.  I was very disappointed. There&#x27;s no scent at all - so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for - you&#x27;re going to be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Coast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also way, way, way, too expensive for what it&#x27;s worth.  I was very disappointed and not impressed with this at all. Sorry Dr. Bonner, but the magic&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I came across the tea-tree soap in my search for more natural soaps. I started out with just washing my hands with the soap, and I could see a visible difference in the first wash - my hands felt softer, moisturized but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, and there are very few products that I dare to use on my face, for fear of break-outs. The tea-tree soap seems to work well for me, leaves my face feeling soft and not greasy or over-dried. The tea-tree scent is pleasing.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps. I have issues with adult acne, so I bought the bars of Tea Tree soap. What a difference!</li>
    <li> Excellent soap clean &amp; refreshing!</li>
    <li> Great soap - lots of suds. Seems to last quite a while considering the amount of lather. I am looking forward to trying other scents.</li>
    <li> Love!  This doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I even use it as face wash!</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Made with natural oils and ingredients, a great alternative to drug store soap with too many artificial ingredients and scents.</li>
    <li> I use this on body and face. Keeps my face clear body odor at bay and smells clean and fresh. I won&#x27;t use any other soap.</li>
    <li> Love this soap it is clearing up my skin and it smells great !</li>
    <li> Um..okay. I like the soap but i bought it at my local drugstore and the packaging says it contains &amp;#34;sodium hydroxide&amp;#34; which burns your skin. I dont know about this..</li>
    <li> This is both my soap and shampoo, good smells, very safe product that really leaves me with a good feel after a shower.</li>
    <li> Been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for a while and really enjoy all their products. This soap leaves me feeling very clean with a nice subtle scent.</li>
    <li> why make me write more than I want to, this is a waste of my time and now is a waste of everyone&#x27;s time to read???</li>
    <li> This soap lathers up really well, much better than other similar soaps, and washes off clean.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap that produces great suds, and rinses off cleanly leaving little or no residue.  You and immediately tell that this soap was carefully crafted to do all the things that a soap is supposed to do, and do it well.</li>
    <li> Love Dr bronner soaps the tea tree is my favorite one</li>
    <li> The Dopest Soap i ever Soaked</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  I have used it for years.  It works well, very refreshing.  It Lasts a while too!</li>
    <li> I had bought the Peppermint Oil version at Target and enjoyed it much. A bit too refreshing after the shower though, you can feel the peppermint oils. This one with tree tea oil is much more agreeable. Smells woodsy when washing with it and leaves a very nice scent once you showered and dried off. Very subtle scent. I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Dove and was very happy with it. A friend turned me on to Bronner&#x27;s and I immediately made the switch. Nice scent that isn&#x27;t over powering. What I like the best is that it leaves no noticeable residue on the skin. Squeaky clean, as they say.</li>
    <li> This product was very drying to my skin at first, but with continued use, my skin has become more tolerant. My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear in years. I use the bar for my face and the liquid soap for showering. My favorites are the peppermint for the tingly feeling and the almond for a smell that is pleasant, yet not overpowering.</li>
    <li> When it comes to soap, as a guy I&#x27;m clueless. My sister is a cosmetologist and I go to her for any advice I need on such things. She recommended tea tree oil for acne use but to balance it with another moisturizer such as coconut butter, as over use of tea tree oil can result in over drying your pores, which is counter-productive with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me get to the good stuff. I obviously ordered this stuff, when I realized what they meant with all-in-one I was thrilled. This can be used as a shampoo, acne clearer-upper and maintains skin moisture. It just works the way its supposed to. It smells nice and neutralizes odors, it&#x27;s good for the environment and doesn&#x27;t have all of that toxic stuff that&#x27;s in most other soaps. Its just awesome I love it!</li>
    <li> My son uses this to keep acne at bay. I buy him a multi-pack every 12-18 months. Amazing that it works so good without having to rely on a bunch of chemicals that are in medicines.</li>
    <li> I started using this and it immediately cleared up my skin on my back.  I had tried many different body washes and medicated sprays and what not, and this obviously made a huge difference.  It is a tad drying, which in my case is a good thing, but some may find that a problem.  The bar soap has been more effective than the liquid castile for acne treatment.  Long story short, I really love it and will use only this in the bath now.</li>
    <li> I am a 28 year old female and was struggling with embarrassing chest acne. Other soaps and scrubs either did nothing or irritated things further.&lt;br /&gt;However once i started using this soap, it has cleared up and i rarely get any chest acne now.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a great smell and good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend likes to use it too since its not very feminine smelling.</li>
    <li> This soap lathers very richly and rinses very clean.  It is fragrant, but not overpowering.  The tea tree oil scent takes some getting used to, but is pleasant enough.  The tea tree dosage is not potent enough to cure athelete&#x27;s foot, but does seem to help prevent its spread and recurrence. The soap also seems to be very effective against minor skin irritations.</li>
    <li> This soap exceeded all of my expectations. All naturally it cleanses and lathers ones body in rich oils. The tea tree oil keeps those nasty fungal infections like athletes foot and jocks itch away! Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps have my seal of approval in every aspect of hygiene that exists.</li>
    <li> Having tried many different products to clear up skin, this is by far the best. It is not harsh, leaves skin moisturized, but also clear. Great product.</li>
    <li> I like Dr. Bronner soap so much ! I have just started using it a month ago because I heard it helps clear acne (young teens, teens and adults). It literally is a miracle worker! My face has cleared up almost completely ! I use it in the shower and then after I use acne cream and they are the best combo ever. This soap gave me a boost in my self esteem. I tell everyone who suffers from acne to use it, you get very fast results and it keeps my face super smooth. I started to clear up the week of me just testing to see if it would work (just washing my face with the soap) then I started to use it with my acne cream about a week after using it, and I&#x27;m almost 100% cleared of acne !!</li>
    <li> ok why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is good.  strange.</li>
    <li> Best natural soaps around. The Tea Tree is great for removing make-up from the face.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap and more!! Really helped skin infections that kept occurring. Highly recommended this product.</li>
    <li> Years later, we&#x27;re exclusively using Dr Bronners, of various scents.  Absolutely the best soap available.</li>
    <li> I like this soap, it has a very nice earthy smell to it, not like a hippy.  I like the bars over the liquids.  The bar is easier to lather than the liquid soaps.</li>
    <li> I heard tea-tree oil was good for skin issues and fungal issues, so I bought this. I love the smell. It&#x27;s a little drying, so we&#x27;re cutting back on its use in the winter, but I really like it. Just be careful if you use it &amp;#34;down under&amp;#34; because it can really sting. I highly recommend this if you have fungal skin issues.</li>
    <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
    <li> Yes, we know it&#x27;s organic and it smells good. I personally was looking for something to clear my skin. At the age of 29 i started getting acne on my cheeks like a prepubescent girl. It drove me nuts. After trying so many creams and astringents I decided to try this and it really worked.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Some people don&#x27;t like the aroma of melaleuca, but I find it rather pleasant. This soap is awesome. Go through a few bars of this soap and then go back to your old soap. You&#x27;ll miss Dr. Bronners.</li>
    <li> I loved loved herthe soap. I am sure I will shop with you in the future. Love the products. Great</li>
    <li> Not as refreshing as the peppermint, but okay.</li>
    <li> This is has to be the best soap on the market. I love everything about it. It def helps out with my folliculitis infection and it leaves my skin feeling very smooth. Since buying this soap, many people have said that I smell great even though the Tea Tree smell is a bit strong. After a while you get use to it and it smells fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only CON if you want to call it a con is that....The soap gets small VERY FAST after constant usage AND it leaves the bottom of the bath tub very slippery. I almost slipped on few occasions. I am not sure if it is THIS soap that does it or ALL Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps does BUT make sure you got sturdy legs while taking a shower. My advice would be to purchase MORE than a 6 pack because the soap does shrink fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this soap to anyone. It is absolutely incredible.</li>
    <li> Excellent. My son who suffers from eczema now uses this soap to help his skin. The difference has been amazing.</li>
    <li> We love this soap... apparently so does everyone else!</li>
    <li> Great soap, great price</li>
    <li> Great bar soap that doesn&#x27;t leave a super strong smell.  Which is a feat for Tea Tree anything.  For someone who doesn&#x27;t like the smell of tea tree much this is bearable, on my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this when I was diagnosed with eczema. It&#x27;s a lovely, gentle soap that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite soap.  He loves it.  It&#x27;s the only one he ever uses.</li>
    <li> Love dr bronner&#x27;s use it in our laundry soap</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are amazing. I have the pepperment one that I will spray on the hardwood floors when sticky stuff just won&#x27;t come up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using The Body Shop&#x27;s Tea Tree Soap and I love it, but because it is liquid, I go through it like water. I know I need the bar soap. It is so eco friendly and as a bar, I won&#x27;t be over using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes out to be $4 and change. Some folks might feel that&#x27;s expensive, but if you compare it to all tea tree oil bar soaps, it is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this once I receive and start using it, but I know their base of their soaps are what I already use, so it can&#x27;t stray to far from my expectations.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and arrived within the specified time frame.</li>
    <li> Very potent tea tree smell.  You can tell it&#x27;s high quality!</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s tea tree soap.  Its the only one we use in the shower - cleans well, doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and seems to keep minor skin rashes and irritations away.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years now. Great soap!!</li>
    <li> Dr Bronners soap is the best ever - all organic ingredients and multiple scents available.  My favorite is the baby one that has no aroma.  And the bar seems to last forever....</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. Lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t make a mess in the shower. Smells nice like the earth.</li>
