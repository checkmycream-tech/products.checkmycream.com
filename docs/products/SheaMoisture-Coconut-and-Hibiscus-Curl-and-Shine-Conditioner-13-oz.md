      <li>Amazing conditioner for curly hair</li>
      <li>Nice conditioner.</li>
      <li>Best product I have ever used on this old rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
      <li>I love love love love it!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Also, I absolutely love the smell of this though and we get a lot of compliments on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite conditioner .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this same version in the shampoo and wasn&#x27;t as impressed as I am with the conditioner.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and I believe that it works much better for her hair type than mine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does tend to leave mine drier and frizzier than my normal product, but works really good on hers so it just depends on your hair type.</li>
      <li>the bottle is huge.</li>
      <li>, it made my hair dryer and frizzier than my cheap gallon of salon beauty conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love this product, but you can get it at walmart for much cheaper!</li>
      <li>It was so nice and soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I finally found something that really works for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good stuff, but I keep going back to my Suave anti frizz.</li>
      <li>I have fine color-treated hair with loose curls, and this does an excellent job of moisturizing without weighing my hair down.</li>
      <li>Most of the products I currently use are not store bought.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so super soft and it literally does all the detangling for me!</li>
      <li>Great hair product for curly thick hair!</li>
      <li>When I use tis conditioner on her hair, it works very well and keeps her unruly hair tamed (but doesn&#x27;t eliminate all the frizz).</li>
      <li>and I really wanted it to work for me</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>My new HG conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I followed up with a hot oil treatment and my hair went back to normal.</li>
      <li>It always leaves my hair so soft.</li>
      <li>The smell alone gets this conditioner five stars from me, and the fact that it manages to tame my fine, curly, hasn&#x27;t-been-properly-cut-in-a-year hair, well that&#x27;s just a bonus.</li>
      <li>It works for my natural hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff defines curls like no other.</li>

<li> Item arrived timely and was exactly as expected.</li>
<li> Some women said they loved it and other women said they hated it.</li>
<li> I did an extreme protein treatment and that saved my hair</li>
<li> Plus this conditioner makes the bumps and irritation come back that i have been working so hard to get rid of.</li>
<li> I have thick curly white girl hair.  </li>
<li> So I research what shampoo and conditioner to buy and a lot of black women recommended Shea Moisture.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s about half the price.</li>
<li> This is one of the few I do use</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick, and coats every strand, so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> My daughter has long, wavy, thin hair</li>
<li> I ran out of my shampoo and conditioner and was using some random shampoo and conditioner that I had and it made my hair so brittle and dry.</li>
<li> Its hard to find in my area.</li>
<li> and now I can finally stop cutting my hair off.</li>
<li> My daughter has thick curly hair &amp; this conditioner works wonders for her.</li>
<li> I have very thick 4B hair</li>
<li> My hair was locking up and knotting up so bad, that in order to get the knots out I had to cut my hair.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed with the results of this conditioner.</li>
<li> Terribly overpowering smell.</li>

    <li> Really great product. Locks on moisture and keeps hair very healthy!!!</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used on this old rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
    <li> Great hair product for curly thick hair!</li>
    <li> I waited for Shea Moisture to create a conditioner in the coconut &amp; hibiscus line. I have 4c hair, and to my amazement, it performs as well as any gel for wash-n-go styles. The slip it provides is as excellent as any Shea Moisture product (i.e., the curl enhancing smoothie), and it works excellently as a leave-in conditioner.  I absolutely love, love, love this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  Great curl definition and not sticky or stiff...will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my hair! I have fine color-treated hair with loose curls, and this does an excellent job of moisturizing without weighing my hair down. My curls are so bouncy! I&#x27;ve used this same version in the shampoo and wasn&#x27;t as impressed as I am with the conditioner. My new HG conditioner.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrific for curly hair, but go elsewhere to buy it. At Walgreens and Target it&#x27;s about half the price. Come on, Amazon! You never do that to us!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, wavy, thin hair and I have thick, coarse, long naturally curly hair. We&#x27;ve both tried it and I believe that it works much better for her hair type than mine. When I use tis conditioner on her hair, it works very well and keeps her unruly hair tamed (but doesn&#x27;t eliminate all the frizz). Also, I absolutely love the smell of this though and we get a lot of compliments on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to leave mine drier and frizzier than my normal product, but works really good on hers so it just depends on your hair type.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It works for my natural hair.I also use it as a leave in. I will definatly by this again. Its hard to find in my area. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not much of a detangler or moisture</li>
    <li> This brand is MAGNIFICENT for curly hair! Oh, and all the products smell delightful!!!</li>

My hair was locking up and knotting up so bad, that in order to get the knots out I had to cut my hair. I thought it was knotting because I was half relaxed and half natural. I didn&#x27;t know it was knotting because of the shampoo and conditioner.

So I research what shampoo and conditioner to buy and a lot of black women recommended Shea Moisture. Some women said they loved it and other women said they hated it. I gave the conditioner a shot and I absolutely love it!! It makes my hair so super soft and it literally does all the detangling for me! I&#x27;ve never had a conditioner that detangled my hair! I love love love love it! I can wash my hair over and over again without it knotting up and now I can finally stop cutting my hair off. I&#x27;m so happy that I finally found something that really works for me. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair oily if I use it daily.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful, I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works on my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff defines curls like no other. I&#x27;m currently using it as a leave in conditioner. It&#x27;s very thick, and coats every strand, so a little bit goes a long way. Provides the shine and conditioning it needs to. Love it!</li>
    <li> Lovely great product for my hair</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT PERFECT FOR FRISSY HAIR.</li>
    <li> Amazing conditioner for curly hair</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with the results of this conditioner. It smelled really good and I really wanted it to work for me but it not only irritated my skin, it made my hair dryer and frizzier than my cheap gallon of salon beauty conditioner. I&#x27;ve reverted back to that now and plan on taking this back for those 12 dollars.</li>
    <li> Terribly overpowering smell. It&#x27;s unfortunate because it moisturizes and detangles very well, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell on my hair for more than a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product with a great smell that enhances the quality of textured hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Most of the products I currently use are not store bought. This is one of the few I do use and I love it! It&#x27;s the perfect conditioner for my type 4 combination hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good stuff, but I keep going back to my Suave anti frizz. Plus this conditioner makes the bumps and irritation come back that i have been working so hard to get rid of.</li>
    <li> Nice conditioner. Would buy again.  AAA+++</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick curly hair &amp; this conditioner works wonders for her. Btw- the bottle is huge. Much bigger than I thought.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner . It always leaves my hair so soft. I have very thick 4B hair and it does wonders for my hair. I use a lot of conditioner with each wash and still have a little over a quarter bottle left.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditions, excellent product, I am very satisfied 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> I have thick curly white girl hair.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely and was exactly as expected.</li>
