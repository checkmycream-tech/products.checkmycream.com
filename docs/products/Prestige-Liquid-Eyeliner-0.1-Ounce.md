      <li>I have since switched to Kat Von D&#x27;s Tattoo eyeliner (waterproof / felt tip), which is AMAZING.</li>
      <li>Really amazing liquid eyeliner for the price.</li>
      <li>Glides on and goes over eyeshadow nicely.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner is OKAY.&lt;br /&gt;I am not too fond of it as I honestly think that my E.L.F. liquid eyeliner is even better&lt;br /&gt;than</li>
      <li>That, or my eyes are really warm and melted it?</li>
      <li>I used this when I was in high school and at the time i thought it was great!</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed this one the most and bought it off of the good reviews it has.  </li>

      <li>Its a great eyeliner, easy to apply and stays whole day + great price.</li>
      <li>and by far the best.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m able to do a nice wing-tip detail with ease.</li>
      <li>Its brush is not very malleable and that&#x27;s perfect for more precise lines and it also glides nicely and it&#x27;s black-black, has a good durability and its not toxic!</li>
      <li>The brush is both precise and flexible - it&#x27;s easy to draw a tapered line for a great feline effect.</li>
      <li>so the fact that my eyelids didn&#x27;t break out is a huge relief!</li>
      <li>and I wish the amount you get was more.</li>
      <li>Plus Too :)</li>

      <li>It lasts all day, and it&#x27;s quite easy to put on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the precision I get when using this eyeliner, the tip is like a marker, it is rough, not one of the flexible types. the color is great very dark. I actually slept in it and it was just as dark and in place as the day before. It is especially nice f you are a beginner at liquid liner. I use this when I don&#x27;t have time for my gel liner or my flexible tip liner.</li>
    <li> I purchased the black color, and it is amazing!!! I&#x27;ve had this eyeliner for 6 months now, and it has worked beautifully all along. It lasts all day, and it&#x27;s quite easy to put on. Definitely one of my favorite liquid eyeliners. I would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat. Truly makes your eyes pop!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this eyeliner for a long time, about 2 years and wear it daily and just now getting my second bottle. I love this liner so much. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the eyeliner, but the brush is a little to stiff. Seems like I remember the brush being a little softer. Overall though it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Love this liquid eyeliner. Very thin applicator brush so you can make thin or thick lines. Glides on and goes over eyeshadow nicely.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice, good looking, just a very small amount... It also came in a large box, which was confusing.</li>
    <li> Nice drawing tip and high quality eyeliner. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Very good for the price listed. Brush is very good. Color is black but don&#x27;t expect it to be super black. And it is not water proof. But as I said for the price it is very good for daily use.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner!  It goes on dark.  But it does smudge slightly.</li>
    <li> Item was as described, the shipping was very prompt.</li>
    <li> Love it-wish I would have gotten several colors and I wish the amount you get was more.</li>
    <li> This is a decent eyeliner. It stays on all day and it&#x27;s black enough. Though, I do have to say, it takes a couple swipes instead of just one to get it dark enough. One swipe, it&#x27;ll look &amp;#34;light black&amp;#34; and the tip of the brush will dig through the line you just made and your skin will show through (hope that&#x27;s understandable). So, then you&#x27;ll have to do one or a couple more swipes. Speaking of the brush, it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s a stiff brush, which is what I like because it makes it much easier for me to get neat lines and a perfect wing. It seems this product will last a decent amount of time, but that also depends on how often you wear makeup. I only wear make-up on the weekends and occasionally once or twice during a week day and I&#x27;ve had mine for maybe 5-6 months now. I of course know of other brands that are better quality and boundly more expensive, but this is decent quality also, especially for the price. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no makeup guru, but this stuff is super super super runny and very hard to remove with makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I like the long-lasting formula that doesn&#x27;t flake or smear, and the application tip, which works like a felt pen. If I make a line that is too thick, I use a dampened Q-tip to remove the extra.</li>
    <li> I love the brush on this brand - it&#x27;s like a felt-tip marker but it&#x27;s not super stiff, like some others I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s the perfect shape and goes on smooth. I wish it were easier to find, but it does last a while, so that is a plus!</li>
    <li> This liquid eyeliner is great!  I used to spend quite a bit on other brands but have switched to this because I like it so much.  This eyeliner goes on smoothly, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t flake.  They also have several other colors that I have tried and have also loved.</li>
    <li> This seems to be the only liquid liner that stays on pretty much all day! Not water proof.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I was in high school and it was the first liquid eyeliner I had ever used in my life and by far the best. I&#x27;ve experimented with so many different other brands (Loreal, Maybelline, ELF...), but with this price and high quality, you cannot go wrong. It is hard to find in stores sometimes, but if you find them at your local drugstore I recommend getting quite a few. I used this about 5-6 days a week when I was in high school and the product lasted maybe 3-4 months, with light usage maybe longer. Whether you&#x27;re a make-up professional or just starting out like I was when I first found this brand, Prestige liquid eyeliner is a MUST! Been using it for maybe seven years now.</li>
    <li> I think they changed their product recipe recently and diluted it.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  The line now takes several layers to get to be truly black and sometimes it still has a grey sheen to it. I&#x27;ve used this product for at least ten years.  Now it&#x27;s time to switch. I used to love how I could get the perfect line almost every time and the brush was just perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pencil girl. But my daughter loves this liquid eyeliner. She does a cute&lt;br /&gt;little cat eye. She says it lasts longer than any other liner. It&#x27;s her one and only&lt;br /&gt;favorite eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am buying this eyeliner for a while. Its a great eyeliner, easy to apply and stays whole day + great price. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This liquid liner is every bit as good as higher-priced brands and I highly recommend it. The brush is both precise and flexible - it&#x27;s easy to draw a tapered line for a great feline effect. The color is rich and lasts all day and yet removal is a breeze. Love it!</li>
    <li> Thank you, I like it a lot</li>
    <li> In my stores, this product cost twice as much...THANX!!!</li>
    <li> It made my eyes sting and water so it ran all over. It was difficult to remove too. I think I will go back to revlon.</li>
    <li> Great product, great value. Did the job well and went on really black. Worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Its brush is not very malleable and that&#x27;s perfect for more precise lines and it also glides nicely and it&#x27;s black-black, has a good durability and its not toxic! Everything I wanted. &#x27;Cause I kinda can&#x27;t live without eyeliner ;D</li>
    <li> This would&#x27;ve been pretty good (I liked the pointed applicator better than other brushes I have tried), but it stings my eyelids terribly. Do not use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite eyeliner. The applicator is pretty firm which makes it somewhat difficult for me to apply and the color isn&#x27;t very rich, looks faded as soon as it dries. Got this for a good price though- it was an add on purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the effect of this, and also that the applicator tip isn&#x27;t too bendable, however the bottle is INCREDIBLY tiny. I will update this when I run out, though I don&#x27;t expect to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This is actually my second purchase of this eyeliner. I have tried numerous liquid liners and this was by far my favorite. It goes on smooth, easy, and black. It stays on all day, as long as it is not rubbed or touched. I love how easy it is to remove. If you make a mistake just use a wet q-tip and wipe it away, no smudges left behind. This will always be my go to liquid liner until I can longer find it to buy.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is OKAY.&lt;br /&gt;I am not too fond of it as I honestly think that my E.L.F. liquid eyeliner is even better&lt;br /&gt;than this. First off, I do not like the hard felt tip brush, I like the soft liquid eyeliner brushes as they will&lt;br /&gt;put on the liquid eyeliner with a thinner line like I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it goes on too sheer. It also contains too little product as the bottle itself is too small.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will stick to my E.L.F. liquid eyeliner for now.</li>
    <li> I got this as an add-on on Amazon and I love it! The brush lines perfect, the black dries well and it goes on matted instead of shiny and it doesn&#x27;t peel. Stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner... I got it in sale in different colors 2 years ago in a drugstore and it beats the hell out of all other expensive eyeliners i had and purchased later... the best! the quality has stayed as its first day and all the colors are awesome! .... I would not be looking for any other eyeliners ever ....</li>
    <li> Goes on well and stays on, but hard to take off. Still worth it though as it stays in during the day.</li>
    <li> Lasted an hour and then I looked like my eyes were done all wrong. If you want to look professional  not the right look</li>
    <li> Works great. I really don&#x27;t need to spend $20 at the department stores anymore because I feel like it works just as well. I&#x27;m quite surprised.</li>
    <li> this is a cheap liner that even with endless amounts of primer and setting powder still bleeds. will not reorder very disapointed.</li>
    <li> I used this when I was in high school and at the time i thought it was great! However when getting it again now, I realize that after 3-4 hours it starts to run and it creates this black shadow under my eyes (if you know what Im talking about). That black shadow is then hard to rub off. Its just not what I&#x27;m looking for. The tip is very firm and small making it easy to apply the liquid liner but I just cant stand the fact that it starts to smudge after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing eyeliner for many years, and have tried many different ones, but I keep going back to Prestige.  I&#x27;ve resolved to stop wasting money trying other brands.  It&#x27;s the best eyeliner for the money -- It goes on smoothly and has true staying power, even though it is not waterproof.  The applicator makes it very easy to draw a fine line along the eyelids.  Lately I&#x27;ve been having difficulty finding it in the local drug stores and Wal Mart, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really love this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED NUMEROUS LIQUID EYE LINERS DURING THE YEARS, BUT ALWAYS REVERTED BACK TO THIS INEXPENSIVE PRESTIGE EYELINER. IT NEVER RUNS AND STAYS IN PLACE.  EVEN IN HEAVY WINDS, WITH MY EYES TEARING, IT DOESN&#x27;T BUDGE.&lt;br /&gt;I RECENTLY ORDERED TWO, JUST TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT I ALWAYS HAVE A SPARE AT HAND!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN &amp;#34;PRESTIGE&#x27;S EYELINER&amp;#34; PERFORMANCE.&lt;br /&gt;I EVEN USE IT ON MY LOWER LASHLINE, GIVING IT A MORE DRAMATIC LOOK, WHEN GOING OUT IN THE EVENING.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner it dries completely matte. The only thing is before it dries it goes on really watery &amp; the brush makes it hard for me to get the perfect line so I have to be extra careful &amp; take a little more time with my cat eye but overall I love the eyeliner it&#x27;s super black and it stays on well.</li>
    <li> It works okay. The only thing I really didn&#x27;t like about it is that it has Parabens in it. Not good, especially going on your eyelids. .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you but i HATE the shiny finish many liquid eyeliners leave. This one though leaves a perfect smooth matte finish. It&#x27;s also long lasting.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t purchase eyeliner sense I always come across ones that aren&#x27;t black enough. They are almost always watery black. So when I read reviews of this, I was intrigued to try it out and they weren&#x27;t lying when they say this eyeliner is BLACK. The point is also very sturdy, so it is easy to control how you move it instead of it doing what it wants to do. I am a newbie at mastering the winged eyeliner and this has helped me out with that. The one thing I will say is that it might be impossible to go for a very thin line sense the brush on this is quite thick. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try something new, liquid eyeliner wise. The shipping was fast and the price is really reasonable. can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many liquid eyeliners ranging from $1 to $20. I always go back to this eyeliner. The eyeliner goes on clean and comes off clean. The felt tip brush makes for easy application and control. Since I use the eyeliner every single day I go through it pretty quickly. But I use it to the very last drop. I think this eyeliner is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I will ONLY use Prestige brand for as long as I can manage. It has a rich, dark, opaque color and the perfect liquid application which dries as you would expect it to. I&#x27;ve used it for almost a decade and it&#x27;s never disappointed or faded during a full day of wear. It&#x27;s very easy to correct or remove if you make a mistake during application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few other brands (from the most well known to the unheard of) and literally every single one had some problem with it, including:&lt;br /&gt;- applies so light you barely see the (black) color&lt;br /&gt;- dries in the same way as glue on skin, so you can peel off the entire line of eyeliner as a solid piece&lt;br /&gt;- applicator brushes are too thin, thick, or strangely shaped&lt;br /&gt;- hard to remove without leaving a dark shadow on skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a Prestige eyeliner that called itself &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; before though, so I was very worried to buy this one. I have no use for a waterproof one, as I find it so convenient to rub some off with a moist Q-tip if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However as many other reviews have stated, this one does not seem to be waterproof in any way at all (despite having the word Waterproof clearly printed on the bottle). I have found no difference at all between this &amp;#34;Waterproof&amp;#34; variety and my regular one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d hate to give this fewer than 5 stars though because I love Prestige that much, but be warned if you are looking for something waterproof!!!</li>
    <li> Really amazing liquid eyeliner for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other liners, hate pencil, used Maybelline liquid liner a bit in my time.  I have enjoyed this one the most and bought it off of the good reviews it has.  It has a good tip to it, but when it starts to run out, the product in the bottle will get a bit chunky to apply.  It holds nicely, mainly stays put the whole day, though I have seen that it ends up on my upper lid at the end of the day, which, if I don&#x27;t want to reapply when I go out, I just smudge it in for a night-time make-up look.  I live in a humid East Coast area, so I imagine that&#x27;s why that happens.  Doesn&#x27;t stop me from wearing it though!</li>
    <li> I love Prestige liquid eyeliners. I don&#x27;t know why but with liquid eyeliners I&#x27;m very sensitive, with other brands I feel taht my eyes are burning, but with these no! They are easy to apply, they last long and they are really pigmented. I received it super fast</li>
    <li> This Eyeliner Saved My Life This Morning! So I Was Doin Mi Sisters Eyeliner And Mi L.A Color Brush Split Apart So I Picked Up This One And Boom It Worked Smoothly And I Made Mi Sister A Beautful Eye Wing. Im Goin To Buy More Soon Quick Shippin As A Prime Memeber Is A Plus Too :)</li>
    <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner for the price.  It stays put, the little applicator is bomb, and the long handle makes it easier to hold.</li>
    <li> this is pretty good. but not the best, i think. dries up quick but kinda hard to shape the line?&lt;br /&gt;i like it won&#x27;t smear after been wearing the whole day.</li>
    <li> Still waiting to use this product. I&#x27;ve always used a Maybelline product and can&#x27;t wait to try this.</li>
    <li> The fine brush tip makes for precision eye lining and sculpting once you get used to doing it. Very well designed long tappering cap/brush combination.</li>
    <li> Not a fan. The brush is kinda stiff so it&#x27;s harder to make a shape.&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m putting it on my eyes start to tear. I have the feeling this product have tons of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;This eyeliner last for longsite and I put it above my other eyeliner</li>
    <li> So this was my first time using a liquid eyeliner from a bottle (as opposed to a liquid pen form) and that just may be the entire reason I disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not easy to apply. At all. There&#x27;s either too much liquid on it or not enough. Making a fine line or slim tip is very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;2. It dried too slow. I had to keep my eyelids nearly closed till it dried completely so no creases formed or smudged anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;3. I found myself reapplying my eyeliner later on in the day and then ending up needing to do so at the end of my night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, disappointed. I don&#x27;t see why this is rated so highly and is definitely a regretful purchase.</li>
    <li> This applicator is slightly on the small side, and can make it difficult for a liquid eyeliner beginner with an unsteady hand to apply. That being said I have used liquid eyeliner for quite some time. This is my perfect little gem. It does not cost much. I have repurchased it. Small applicator leads for smooth accurate application. I have sensitive skin- it did not irritate me. It came out very black. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Just ok, tends to go on too thick. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE eyeliner. Decided to buy it through Amazon out of convenience but I&#x27;ve been buying it for years from Harmon. It applies exactly how I like it and stays on long.</li>
    <li> Very good for the novice makeup artist. Nice clean lines this product was really easy to use. I fly for a living this product is also tiny</li>
    <li> Great for the price. I love the fact that it has a very thin point which makes it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> My favorite eyeliner. Its not really sold in many convenient stores anymore, so finding it was kind of a struggle when i ran out. Not waterproof, but really easy to clean when you mess up.</li>
    <li> Glides on smooth, a little goes a long way and stays all day!</li>
    <li> It has a wand rather than a brush. I can not seem to make the thin line which I wish to do.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeline. It&#x27;s dark enough for me and doesn&#x27;t smudge if you don&#x27;t touch it. It&#x27;s not waterproof. Only smudges when I accidently wipe my eyes. Shipping wasn&#x27;t that long either. I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any irritation like others claimed..... Really awesome for cat eyes, the tip is actually plastic instead of felt so it doesn&#x27;t wear down over time, it&#x27;s a consistent tip. The black color lasts all day too, doesn&#x27;t smudge like others. I think this will be my new eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on very dark black but it tends to fade and flake after about 5 hours of wear. The felt tip gets loose fibers/strings after a week or so of use which make the product clumpy and harder to control. It dries to an attractive matte finish.</li>
    <li> I have tried both dept. store and drug store brand eye liners. I have tried them all from liquids, to pens, to gels to crayons you name it. Trying to search for that perfect, blackest black eye liner that will last more than a few hours. Well here it is ladies, this stuff is the best. For about six dollars this stuff will not fade, flake, crease or dissapear on you. To give you an idea I went to the gym with my son the other day. Did an intense one hour work out for an hour on the tradmill. Sweated my butt off, where I was dripping, including my face of course. Went in to the gym restroom thinking my makeup would be a mess, nope. My eye liner looked like I had just appled it! Today I put my make up on at 8:30 th morning, if I told you I am sitting here at my computer at 8:45 p.m. and my eye liner looks exactly the same as I applied it 12 hours ago would you believe me?? Seriously, this is the best eye liner ever. I am so impressed with this stuff I feel the need to go out and buy some back up in case they stop selling it. With other eye liners I normally have to touch it up in the middle of the day not this one. If you are looking for a very cheap, stay put eye liner that does not fade to an icky faded black, please try this. You will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> It is what I expected. Thin applicator for precise application.</li>
    <li> like it - just hard to apply because i&#x27;m an amateur.</li>
    <li> loved this eyeliner ever since I saw a makeup artist use it on an e!news show, it goes on pretty dark for a liquid eyeliner.</li>
    <li> To Dry, Have to keep dipping it in bottle to go across eye.  Should just glide on, oh well always trying different products.  Like my Liner Pencil from Lancome  better than this dry liquid one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this same exact eyeliner for nearly four years and I have found nothing better.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t work well with eyeliner pencils and liquid eyeliner pens so when I got this I was super happy it was easy to use and it made my eyes look very detailed and bigger the look I was hoping for from this eyeliner. Also my skin is super sensitive and I have massive allergies to many make ups so the fact that my eyelids didn&#x27;t break out is a huge relief! :) I&#x27;m very happy with this eye liner an definitely recommend it to people looking for that detailed fresh look from an eyeliner. Though if you have shakey eyes or unsteady hands or aren&#x27;t that experienced with eyeliner I recommend getting eyeliner pencils. Their much easier to take off if you make any annoying mistakes or accidental marks. :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to apply.  Even it is not waterproof, it lasts for a long while.</li>
    <li> My boss recommended this liner to me last year and I have used it religiously ever since. I work in the Spa/Salon industry and my outward appearance matters. I have really oily eyelids and have tried hundreds of different liners over the years- this one has the pigment and staying power I need.</li>
    <li> I discovered it in Walgreens a year ago (or Rite Aid), and they no longer carry it for some reason so I bought it online,  and it&#x27;s the best over-the-eyelid liner I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on smoothly and never smudges!!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for years and every time I go to the drugstore, they are always out of black. this works great, doesn&#x27;t smudge or run!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and all of sudden the stores no longer sells it. Glides on smoothly and very pigmented.</li>
    <li> Nice Thx for the fast shipping.</li>
    <li> great deal. love prestige products</li>
    <li> I am asian. I have &amp;#34;the fold&amp;#34; in my eyes, having a pretty large eyelid, and I have used Maybelline waterproof liner for about 10 years. I decided to try something new, since that one clumps after a few weeks. This one was great but on one lid, it smudged because of how my eyes crease. This made for eyes that have large lids that do not touch. That, or my eyes are really warm and melted it? Who knows.</li>
    <li> I like this brand because the shape of the tip has the most precision. And, it&#x27;s not waterproof, so you don&#x27;t end up with raccoon eyes.</li>
    <li> Great liquid liner! I really like the applicator tip - it is soft enough to apply smoothly and painlessly, yet stiff enough that it doesn&#x27;t suddenly add more than you want. It can smudge before it is dry, but once on it stays put for a long time. Gives real precision to application. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Went on perfect. i had never used liquid eyeliner but for what it was worth the product was amazing&lt;br /&gt;and easy</li>
    <li> Glides on smooth so I bought 2!</li>
    <li> Got this because I was looking for a new liquid eyeliner to compare to The Body Shop liquid eyeliner. I have to say that this did its job, but it did wear off by the end of the work day. I know I read reviews about fading / wearing off and I thought it was fine (which is why I tried it). I have since switched to Kat Von D&#x27;s Tattoo eyeliner (waterproof / felt tip), which is AMAZING. It&#x27;s a little tough to remove, but it does last A LOT longer than Prestige.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the fading, it&#x27;s a decent liquid eyeliner for the price. :)</li>
    <li> THIS IS SO EASY FOR ME TO APPLY EVEN WITHOUT GLASSES  and it dries in seconds so you can apply the rest of eyeshadow</li>
    <li> Great product, just as expected. Does NOT test on animals. Love the firm sponge applicator. I do not like brushes because they get mishapen over time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go anywhere without heavy black eyeliner on. EVery single day. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and styles but I like this one best. The brush is firm so I can control where I want it to go, but still has enough give to not feel like I&#x27;m gouging my eye out. It stays all day long and I never have to touch it up.</li>
    <li> HIGHLY pigmented, easy to apply, gives a great line. But...it burns like crazy when applied. The burning goes away after a while, but it still irritated my eyes eventually later in the day, which caused me to rub, which caused smudging...and more burning. By the end of the day my eyes looked bloodshot red and the liner was all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a great product if they&#x27;d change whatever ingredient causes the burning. I don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes/skin and this is a common complaint for this product. I didn&#x27;t check the reviews before buying. What a shame.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner &amp; I go out of my way for it. It doesn&#x27;t crack when it dries &amp; it doesn&#x27;t look ashy upon drying. I usually get it at rite aid but they never have it in stock. Thank goodness I was able to find it online &amp; for around the same price I pay for it at the stores. Best part, didn&#x27;t have to run store to store trying to find it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for 2 years. Its brush is thick and more similar to a felt tip eyeliner, so the application is extremely smooth. I get perfect cat eyes in less than 1 minute. However, it smudges throughout the day and is not waterproof at all, which makes it easy to remove but a pain sometimes.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge easily, and has a nice matte black finish.</li>
    <li> So easy to apply, so dark and intense. Hasn&#x27;t smudged or smeared since I&#x27;ve had it on ( I just got it today, will update if anything changes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge on the tip is perfect for flicking up that cat eye point, and not so thin that you have to go over you lids several times, you get a good solid coat on the first run through.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner you can use it all day I have all the colors</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner i have ever used. I absolutely love it and plan on buying more once I run out of my current one.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye liner ever. I only use this brand of liquid liner mostly because I prefer the tip, it is easy to draw with.</li>
    <li> Great liquid eyeliner!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, never buying expensive high end eyeliner again. Stays on all day and has a matte finish. Love it, buying another one after I write this review!</li>
    <li> This is honestly the best liner I have ever tried. It won&#x27;t flake on you and it is a DEEP black. It isn&#x27;t water proof, But I found that it stays on ALL day and night and come off easily with soap and water or your makeup remover. The applicator is very nice and I&#x27;m able to do a nice wing-tip detail with ease. stock up on these now ladies!</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand of liquid eyeliner for years. I have been faithfully using liquid eyeliner in my routine for over 20 years and experimenting with different brands (both cheap and high-end) and this is by far the best brand that I have used. I was disappointed when my local drug store stopped carrying it so I purchased it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my overall thoughts on the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It is a bit light during the first few uses, keep shaking it well and it will get darker and stay dark.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes it can sting for a second but for me it&#x27;s nothing serious and it was only if I had allergies or something irritated my eyes previously.&lt;br /&gt;-It lasts all day and night (for those of us who have fallen asleep with it on)&lt;br /&gt;-The applicator is fantastic because it is not a brush that gets dull and unusable over time. It&#x27;s hard applicator makes it last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;-No need to water it down if it dries a bit, just go back to square one and shake vigorously.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve had a bottle last a year, this eyeliner is absolutely incredible and has a long shelf life.</li>
    <li> I am a total klutz, and using this eyeliner is so easy for me (well, comparatively). Best one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner but the brush that comes with kind of sucks.</li>
    <li> THE BEST FOR CAT-EYES. DON&#x27;T PUT IT IN YOUR WATERLINE, THOUGH, IT BURNS. I HEARD ABOUT THIS FROM CHERRY DOLLFACE (VINTAGE YOUTUBER). LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eyeliner!</li>
    <li> I had really high expectations for this item because of the reviews. I was looking forward to getting a waterproof eyeliner (my first) and I was slightly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The color is a strong shade of black&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t smudge when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s hard to apply&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s not waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s hard to get the right thickness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the great to be honest and I always have to use my other liquid eyeliner along with this one to get it right.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price. I love how quickly it dries and it&#x27;s good to suit my needs.</li>
</ol>
