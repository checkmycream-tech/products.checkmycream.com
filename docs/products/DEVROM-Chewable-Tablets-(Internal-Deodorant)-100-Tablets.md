<li> This product has removed a source of anxiety and embarrassment that has plagued me in social situations for years.  </li>
<li> My wife is not as self conscious about her foul smelling gas, and if there&#x27;s no sound, I don&#x27;t even notice.</li>
<li> I had GS surgery and after a few months developed gas.</li>
<li> i took half the bottle, i still have some left.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say it didn&#x27;t work for them.</li>
<li> However, Bismuth (the active ingredient in Devrom AND Pepto-bismal) bonds with the sulfur, and doesn&#x27;t leave any over to make hydrogen sulfide.</li>
<li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I found I need to take about 4 pills a day at regular intervals in order to not be &#x27;noxious&#x27; and that&#x27;s a bit tedious.</li>
<li> Waste of my money.</li>
<li> I no longer have to fear taking ill timed deep breaths in her presence.</li>
<li> Goodbye the small.</li>
<li> Also expensive to maintain, if you stop taking it, you go back to normal &#x3D;(</li>
<li> Waste of money!!</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> Who knows, you may never have to blame that foul odor on the poor dog or a random stranger ever again.</li>
<li> I was skeptical  about this stuff.  </li>
<li> Then the gas was constant and  took on a horrific smell!</li>
<li> Kinda Stinks</li>
<li> I was afraid to leave the house.</li>
<li> There are hardly ANY bad odors now when he dumps his bag!!  </li>
<li> Trying to eliminate sulfur from your food is nearly impossible.</li>
<li> So give these a try if bad smelling gas is something you struggle with.</li>
<li> No matter what I ate the gas smelled horrible.</li>
<li> No gas pills worked, the gas was still there and so was the horrible stench!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is very effective!  My husband has an illeostomy and found this in a catalog with illeostomy supplies and decided to try it.  There are hardly ANY bad odors now when he dumps his bag!!  I&#x27;m thinking about using it too even though my \\&quot;plumbing\\&quot; is still normal - it works that WELL!  He only takes one per day and that seems to work just fine.</li>
    <li> the product worked great for odor!  However, taking only 1 tablet 3x a day made me very constipated so only 3 stars.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I wish they had a way to advertise it effectively.  It works and has no side effects.</li>
    <li> Works great for gas due to medication.</li>
    <li> It is really good. It works really well. Goodbye the small.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my hubby who had gastric bypass last year.  All I can say is they work for him and I&#x27;m very pleased!!!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm just keep taking it.  Internal deodorants are worth the cost to make your live less stressful.</li>
    <li> while it does not diminish gas it does eliminate the odor.  After having a gastric bypass this was a real problem for me.  Great product.  Taste good too.</li>
    <li> A Heartfelt Thank You to whoever created this product! I had GS surgery and after a few months developed gas. Then the gas was constant and  took on a horrific smell! I wanted to run away from myself. The smell was unbearable and it lingered. I went to Dr they did tests, scans but found nothing. Turns out it is a side effect of the surgery! No gas pills worked, the gas was still there and so was the horrible stench! Every place smelled, my house, my car. It has been a nightmare experience. I have been so embarrassed. I was afraid to leave the house. I went out when I had to and I would not eat anything for fear of gas smell.&lt;br /&gt; No matter what I ate the gas smelled horrible. Protein supplement shakes which I need, smelled the worst.&lt;br /&gt;DEVROM saved My Social Life! Seriously. I can go out in public again.&lt;br /&gt;DEVROM worked from the 1st pill. Thank You....Thank You...Thank You.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has a medical condition that causes body odor This Product is definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;Gratefully,&lt;br /&gt;Donna</li>
    <li> I buy this for my employer on a regular basis (I&#x27;ve never used it myself) but she loves it and has been using it for years. Delivery was very fast, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These work well, though makes my stool dark, and i wished I didnt have to take so many each day. Makes you go through the bottle really quick. Also expensive to maintain, if you stop taking it, you go back to normal &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, and it works, to my everlasting joy. I no longer have to fear taking ill timed deep breaths in her presence. This stuff is marriage saving. My wife is not as self conscious about her foul smelling gas, and if there&#x27;s no sound, I don&#x27;t even notice. I cannot recommend this stuff enough. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say it didn&#x27;t work for them. I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it worked for my wife. So give these a try if bad smelling gas is something you struggle with. Who knows, you may never have to blame that foul odor on the poor dog or a random stranger ever again.</li>
    <li> Still had gas after using it.....  Kinda Stinks</li>
    <li> It truly works. After bariatric surgery this helps a lot. It&#x27;s much better than the chlorophyl tablets. Time to reorder.</li>
    <li> did not work, would not buy again. i took half the bottle, i still have some left. I wish we could get our money back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of ways of getting rid of smelly gas, but this is the only thing that consistently works.</li>
    <li> Had Gastric bypass 5 yrs ago. Did not help with smell of bowel movements or smell of gas. Waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Chewable-so easy to use on the run</li>
    <li> This product does not seem to provide relief from digestive gas odor as it was supposed to  if taken as directed</li>
    <li> This is chemistry. Noxious Flatus (the technical name) is the result of hydrogen sulfide formation in the bowels. Trying to eliminate sulfur from your food is nearly impossible. However, Bismuth (the active ingredient in Devrom AND Pepto-bismal) bonds with the sulfur, and doesn&#x27;t leave any over to make hydrogen sulfide. You can&#x27;t take Pepto every day because it has side-effects. But you can take this stuff every day. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I found I need to take about 4 pills a day at regular intervals in order to not be &#x27;noxious&#x27; and that&#x27;s a bit tedious.</li>
    <li> Have yet to see the difference</li>
    <li> This product worked as stated.  I use it daily and find the odor in the colostomy pouch is greatly diminished.</li>
    <li> works fabulous have been using it for years</li>
    <li> I have been using this product (Devrom) for almost five years now.  Ever since my gastric bypass surgery, I have had a need for the internal deordant and this product does what it advertises.  I will continue to order it in the future as needed.</li>
    <li> This product has removed a source of anxiety and embarrassment that has plagued me in social situations for years.  Nothing I tried before even came close to giving the complete relief that Devrom provides. It really works, and It&#x27;s easy to use. Just pop a tablet and chew.  They taste pretty good and can be carried in a pill box to take wherever you are.  Thanks to Mary Roach&#x27;s book, Gulp, for teaching me about this amazing, simple remedy.</li>
    <li> Beano and GasX claim to diminish gas production.  For me, they don&#x27;t.  Devrom doessn&#x27;t affect the quantity of gas, but it certainly Makes the odor inoffensive. Sign me up for a lifetime supply!</li>
    <li> This product is saving me a lot of embarrassment.  Doesn&#x27;t remove the gas, but removes the smell.  I&#x27;m really thankful to have found it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. I have tried it multiple times and i was by my doctor not to use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Everyone I have shared these wonder tablets with loves them.</li>
    <li> It really works!!!!!!!! Product works as well as it stated. Takes care of the problem with no side affects at all.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> While the product may work for some it has not worked well for me. That&#x27;s about I have to say on this item.</li>
    <li> These were a life-saver and worked to get rid of sulfur-smelling flatulence when nothing else would. Glad I bought them.</li>
    <li> I took these pills for several days and they didn&#x27;t work.  I won&#x27;t buy them again.  It is probably a question of body chemistry.</li>
    <li> Guess they help. Thought they would be better.</li>
    <li> I tried change in diet and probiotics, which did not help my odor.  I was skeptical  about this stuff.  But, it really works.  My bowel movements and flatulence are now tolerable</li>
    <li> If you want to reduce the odor by 70%, this is a great product.  I wish it was 100%, but 70% is a huge improvement and nothing else that I have seen or tried can do even close to this.  If you have a family member with bedside comode, this product is a must buy.  I give my dad 2 with each meal and it makes everyone happy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was given a paper advertising devrrom by a daughter of mine. IT seems to help the gas. Ask your doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get chewables.  Got capsules instead and I can&#x27;t take capsules!  I can only do chewables.  Waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Chewable tablets, don&#x27;t need water to swallow, easy to use anytime. Effectively eliminates most of the odor from an ileostomy. Pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> I really stink when I fart and it was becoming a problem with people commenting . And helps with BM.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me, in fact gave me stomach upset</li>
