<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the first time ever a diet pill that works miracles.  I&#x27;m 30 yo female and have had 2 children.  My body has never been the same... blah, blah, blah.  I started taking this a week ago and have lost 5lbs.  No joke, it works, and I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market!</li>
    <li> This product is great!  My husband and I have successfully lost a significant amount of weight.  In fact since we are not at our goal weight as of yet we are reordering to continue the process.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter. In three weeks, I noticed the difference. She lost inches in her waist and face area. The product controls the appetite.</li>
    <li> I was about 155lb for the last two years after I had my daughter. I was so desperate to try anything so I can be who I was before I had my child. I spent over $1,000 on diet pills/exercises equipment. I had a cousin that was taking two day diet and lost a tremendous amount of weight. She suggests that I give it a try because she was the same weight I was a couple months ago and she lost over 20 lbs within the first month. I then went ahead and bought some. I had to admit that I wasn&#x27;t sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work just like the other pills I have brought in the past. In the first week, I notice I was losing about one to two pounds a day. By the time I knew it I lost 30lbs in less than two months. I am so happy that I did buy the pills because I felt sexier and I can shop in the stores that I used to. I highly recommended this to anyone who wants to lose over 20lbs.</li>
    <li> I had the good and the bad one&#x27;s.  This, the 2 day diet is the real deal. I just purchaded in October, this year 09. Fast shipping and superb results.  I lost 10lbs in a month. Im going to go another 10.  Your appetite is very well decreased.  Some side effects, e.g. headache, dry mouth and frequent bowel movements.  Very normal though.  I&#x27;m very happy and satisfied.  I would not tell you differently!  Mr. Bargain is the greatest.  Keep your product going! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I want to know if these are authentic pills and are actually the real ones... I have been taking these for 2 wks but my friend sells them for $40. I want to know if maybe I can get them cheaper without having to sacrifice the quality???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure these pills are authentic, my appetite was suppressed quite a bit and they definitely were \\&quot;clearing my system\\&quot; so they have to have real stuff in them to be effecting me, but I didn&#x27;t see very much weight loss, then again I am kind of a lazy person lol I saw way better results with the Royal Slimming Formula but I can&#x27;t find those anywhere so these will do, just have to get out and go for walks or something right? The whole gym thing, with the shared machines and tons of people, isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I have found this product really works.  I take 2 per day right before breakfast.  I eat breakfast, and lunch and nothing else.  This keeps me energetic and also helps me with appetite control at night. I received it fast and with not issues.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me so I could not recommend it.   Thanks</li>
    <li> It works great as a cleanse but I haven&#x27;t lost a pound.  I have been taking 2 a day now for weeks.</li>
    <li> Left my mouth really dry so that I would drink more water.  Blocked my appetite but I lost no weight and I took it for 3 weeks.  I figure  a \\&quot;2 day diet\\&quot; should work atleast a little after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am sorry but these pills were not the original ones- they did not work. I have to now shop around.. They might be oribinal but the light version- I would say they only clean your system at a 10%- no real change .--</li>
    <li> I seen this product work for other women I know, but I personally worry about how dehydrated I got.  After I stopped the product I stayed thirsty for almost a week.  I happen to be somebody that doesn&#x27;t do well with strong remedies.  The girls I work with have lost weight and like the product. I think it depends on your own body and how it works.  I do suggest drinking or eating orange juice.  It helps keep the thirst away a little.</li>
    <li> I have to admit when these pills came out...it was the hottest thing...My whole departmentat work took it and people thought we were on crack (literally) the way the weight dropped.  I had a horrible side affect...my skin broke out and I have all kind of irregular molds..I went to my derm who immediately took me off the pills....I know many people who have used it without that side affect...please when u have reached ur desired weight...reduce your dosage and take time and come off or you will experience double the weight gain...    FYI this was one of the weight loss pill the FDA banned...    Good luck to you all...much RESPECT</li>
    <li> These pills are a complete colon cleanse! Everything that I ate just came out as water out my butt! Talk about diarrhea!</li>
    <li> Make sure it is the original, ask the seller every question, make sure that you visit the doctor, let him/her know of your supplement activities; also check your body fuction byt doing a blood test, CBC and BMP would cover it. to make sure that your body its rteacting well. Futhermore, though this product take your appetite away, eat, if not you will have a headache for days.  THere are ways to make sure you get the original one. even if it cost more get the original. I cannot stress this enough. and If you have a bloodpreasure problem make sure this medication is reviewed by your doctor. I did it, and I lost 20 pounds in 2 month. SO!! IT REALLY WORKS. but it won&#x27;t work for every one.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product.  I tried it a few year&#x27;s ago from a co-worker and had great results.  I watched my pounds and inches melt away.  I didn&#x27;t notice but co-worker&#x27;s and parent&#x27;s did.  Making comment&#x27;s on how good I looked.  I was waiting for the period where it would stop the affect as some pills that I&#x27;ve taken have done.  But, no they kept on working.  I couldn&#x27;t find the pills after a while.  As they stopped selling them at my chinese herb store.  But so happened to find them on Amazon.com.  I didn&#x27;t tell any one I was taking the pills. Not sure of the results.  As it had been so long since taking them.  But once again positive results.  And co-worker&#x27;s are wanting them to.  As they see how I have lost so much so quickly.  I haven&#x27;t lost so much as pounds but inches yes. I have tried everything you can imagine.  But these pils have satisfied my urge to eat constantly.  I have had no side affects.  Just being thirsty a lot.  But have started drinking water which is a positve thing for me. I recommend it definately. I feel so much better.  And see life in a new light.</li>
    <li> Bought this product from Japan 2-Day.  It is authentic (has the herbal/mushroom smell) and has all the other indicators shown in the photos.      After two days, it is suppressing my appetite and doesn&#x27;t have the side-effects that I had with the Super Slim Pomegranate.  It doesn&#x27;t shut off my appetite completely like Super Slim did, but that was much less effective after about 10 weeks and the side effects were sometimes difficult.  I regained about 5 pounds of the 15 I lost once I went off the Super Slim.      I&#x27;ve found these postings very helpful and wanted to add my 2 cents.  Japan 2-Day seems to be the best distributor for authentic asian diet pills.  I&#x27;ve used them 3 times now and always get the authentic product delivered quickly.      Today I&#x27;m ordering the tea and will see if that enhances the effects.  Now that I&#x27;m in my mid-forties, it&#x27;s nice to have extra help loosing that extra 10-20 pounds.  For others, I would not use any of these mystery formula pills if I were in poor health, had high blood pressure or heart trouble.  Take care.</li>
    <li> I have a strong feeling that the Vendor Oxi Superstore is selling a fake product.  I have taken this pills before and bought it from another store and it does not give me any bad side effects.    This bottle that I got from Oxi Superstore, gives me monstrous headaches that are scary and gives me tummy aches.  I have also tried contacting the seller but they never once emailed me back after I have made the purchase.  The seller was quick to respond when I had questions before I bought it but after I have received the product and made the purchase they never replied to my emails after, I will dispute this purchase for sure.</li>
    <li> i received the package very quick and i did not pay for expedited shipping...thnak u</li>
    <li> This product does not seem to work like the 1st one that I bought from a herbal store which no longer carries it. I don&#x27;t get the same effects. It does not suppress the appetite. With the first one, I could go almost all day without being hungry until I realize that I need to eat something. With this one, all I do is eat. It doesn&#x27;t work as far as I am concern</li>
    <li> This truly is the original Japanese lingzhi diet pill.  It works as advertised, and made me forget to eat without feeling jittery, nervous or ill in any way.  This pill was great!</li>
    <li> Please be advised! This is not the Original Japanese 2 Day Diet Lingzhi Pill. Make sure when purchased read ingredients:Needs to have Flax Seed [[ASIN:B001OT203G Japanese 2 Day Diet Lingzhi]].</li>
    <li> 2/5/10-First of all, the delivery was very fast. But I just started to take them today. All I can say, that I did not feel that hungry today. But I do wonder if they are kosher or not, I mean does it contain gelatin from a pork source?  I will put up a second review if I get any good results.     2/8/10- I have not lost any weight yet, but I do notice that my body shape is changing a bit. I feel alert, and not as weak as I used to be while dieting. But, I can&#x27;t sleep. For the past 2 days, I slept for about 4 hours each night, compare to the 8-9 hours I used to sleep. I do not know if that is a good thing or not.</li>
    <li> The product seemed to help curb my appitite. I noticed a decrease in my pants size after 1-month of use.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I think it works really well and was impressed with the fact that I received it quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and it did not do anything for me. I think it may not be the original formula because last year I lost 20 lbs from these pills (bought from a store here in my city). This specific one I bought from this seller did not work for me. I contacted the seller to keep her updated (as she requested me to do so as I was skeptical) and no reply. Guess that just says it all!</li>
    <li> I love these pills.They work GREAT.I bought them and lost 20 pounds in a month and a half.But you have to work with the pills,try to eat better and YOU WILL loose the weight.Dont expect to loose weight while you are eating mc donalds people!!!!But so far i love this product and will keep ordering.The only bad thing is your mouth gets really dry,which makes you drink water constantly(which is a good thing)</li>
    <li> The first bottle I got work fine I lost a lot of weight, but when I got the second bottle I didnt lose any weight... I think I got the fake pills. You never know what are u going to get everytime</li>
    <li> Ihave the original ones I was able to get from a friend in an import/export business. I bought these to compare and I honestly haven&#x27;t taken them yet but they didn&#x27;t pass the physical comparison test. First, the seal on this box is a clear sticker, the seal on the original is a clear sticker with japanese imprint (light gray letters). The color of the pills are slightly different. These are more purple tone where as the original are more of a reddish tone. Finally I opened them both to compare the substance inside and these had a powdery almost talc substance where as the originals have a more granulated substance not powdery like. More like ground coffee.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I was looking for a product that will help me loose all my baby fat that I have accumulated having 3 kids. this is the best product and it is very cheap, it supresses my appetite and when I do eat, it is in very small quantities and I am glad to say that I have lost all my baby weight and then some. I will still order this product for weight maintanance. I cann&#x27;t say enough about this product!!! GOOD LUCK and DON&#x27;T FORGET TO EAT.</li>
    <li> The review will not allow zero stars, but this is a ZERO star rating.  I received a fake product. Bottle and box had obviously bad copies of authentic product. My bottle had 6 or 7 less pills than it should have had and a few were broken open, leaving a grainy residue in bottom of bottle. I gave feedback in amazon /nicnax review, and received two rude email.  I wrote back asking the company to stop being rude and either refund my product or return my money.  Chevonne Torres on nicnax said she&#x27;d send another bottle of (authentic) product. The next day Ted anderson of nicnax said \\&quot;Please return the following item that you have received and we will refund you.\\&quot;  I believe that nicnax should pay for shipping and sent an email asking for return delivery procedure.  So far, I have not heard from anyone.  Please see my positive reviews on Slim Express Tea order.</li>
    <li> I purchased  it through the reccommendation of a friend, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Also my friend also gives it a poor review. I took it for 3 weeks and i didnt lose any weight.</li>
    <li> Well, this product works great but I notice a bigger change last time I purchased from a local store. This product does help specially with the energy and amount of food your body asks for. I didnt loose alot of pounds but my stomach did look better as well as my under arms and my face and alot of people notice the difference now Im gone try the same pills but with the tea and see how it works. So far I havent had any side effects at all I only felt with much more energy and thirsty thats all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Mr. Bargain so I do not know if it was the authentic product or not. I was expecting  an appetite suppressant or at least an energy booster and this product provided neither. This purchase was a complete waste of money and I will not puchase it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a Sunday and received it by Friday morning. The whole process from purchasing to delivery was fast and easy. I love the Japan Lingzhi Diet!!! I have recommend this product to almost everybody I know.</li>
    <li> Very effective weight loss product and great service. Will be a return customer for sure!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since September and have lost 1 to 4 pounds every week. I have not had any problems with the product and plan to continue using this until I reach my goal. The only thing I have noticed is that if I eat too much fat, I tend to \\&quot;purge\\&quot; the next day.  Uncomfortable, but it makes me think before I eat. Thanks for making this wonderful product available.</li>
    <li> I tried a bottle of the 2 Day Diet and with no \\&quot;extra\\&quot; work I lost about 10 lbs in a month.  I reordered them from a different vendor on Amazon because I could not locate the pills with my original vendor and there were NO results.  I didn&#x27;t gain the weight back, but I wasn&#x27;t losing anything new.  I even tried taking 3 pills instead of the recommended two, and nothing.  The bottles and pills looked exactly the same, but the 1st batch had an herbal smell to it while the 2nd batch had no smell at all.  The 2nd batch was completely useless.  Finally I saw that my original vendor had reposted and just received the bottle with the new pills that HAVE a smell to them.  Hopefully I should start dropping lbs again with these.      The side effects of the pills (the good ones) are loss of appetite, dry mouth, sometimes you will feel like you have to use the bathroom but it&#x27;s not bad.  For the first two weeks on (what I consider) the real pills, I had slight insomnia but it went away.      Good luck with your weight loss!</li>
    <li> I had heard great things about this product.  I even had friends and family members who had tried it and obtained excellent results.  However, I decided to discontinue using the pills because I was feeling very tired, and a bit weird, to the point that I could not continue taking the pills.  I am sure, this product works for some people, but not all of them.  Everyone has a different metabolism, so it just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product previously from another supplier and received what I thought was a better product.  I am not sure why this product was different but it was.  It did not work at all to me.  Product took a very long time to arrive and did nothing for hunger.  Previously ordered product worked very well and this package was identical but something was different within the pills because it did not work.</li>
    <li> For the first time ever a diet pill that works miracles. I noticed a decrease in my pants size after 1-month of use.  The product was melting my fat away.  The 2 day diet Japan Lingzhi Slimming Formula is the real deal. Fast shipping and incredible results! Your appetite is very well decreased. Some side effects, e.g. frequent bowel movements and heart palpitations.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 2 day diet AND the super slim pomegranate. I began taking both on Feb 16, not for any real reason I just received them both on the same day. On Feb 16 I weighed in at 149 lbs. Today, March 5, I weighed myself and I&#x27;m 134lbs! Super freaking weight loss.     Now when i first began taking them, I was eating healthy (mostly salad and low fat lunch meats)and jogging for the first 3 days. After the 4 day I didn&#x27;t really have time so I wasn&#x27;t jogging but I kept losing weight. At one point i was losing a pound a day.     Con: The only real side effect I had was dry throat but that went away after a week.</li>
    <li> I first heard about Linzhi&#x27;s 2 day diet from my mom who bought it in a japanese market for 30 dollars .&lt;br /&gt; I followed the instrustions one pill the first 3 days then two pills in the morning on the 4th day . I noticed linzhi completly supressed my appetite, to the point i had to make my self eat . I was always thristy for nice cold water,So where ever i went i carried a lil gallon to quench my thrist. I walk a mile  almost every day to the nearst super market ,or to my favorite fast food place and i noticed i was sweating more then usual , I think thats why i was always so thirsty. when it came to eating out, i was always taking home my left overs, since what was left over was more then half. I was eating when i was hungry ,so no more over eating. Im 20 years old  5\\&quot;5&#x27; and at the time 145 pounds wich is chubby,and not sexy me being apple shaped . wich means when i gain weight i gain it on my upper body first my arms and back ,i hated my love handles. With Linzhi&#x27;s 2 day diet i lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks ... it really isnt a 2 day diet it cleans you out the first 2 ,3 days giving me diareah .Every time i ate afterwards went to the bathroom so it really does boost your metabolism making you regular. I get lots of compliments on how tight my skin looks ,its drinking all that water. With linzhi youll still weight even with out excercise .. I just think its so much better with. The trist never goes away while on linzhi. I recommend it to any one whos ready for those side effects :)</li>
    <li> These pills are so hard to find now and I was so happy when I found them here.The shipping was so fast!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It help supress my appitite quite a bit and give me extra energy without the gitters.  It&#x27;s been about 30 days and I have lost about 10 lbs. without exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first couple of days my heart kind of pounded really fast, but that went away. That was the only downer for this product.  I guess my body had to adjust to the pills.</li>
    <li> I placed an order on the 9/28 for $25.00 (free shipping) and recieved my product within a week tops! Shipping was great, BUT they sent me a bottle that was already OPENED! There was no seal or wrapping around the bottle. I immediately contacted Amazon and request a replacement or refund. They only do refunds for the product so, I immediately shipped it back. It&#x27;s safe to say I will NOT order from MR. Bargain again!</li>
    <li> These pills are the best , I lost 13 lbs in a month so far</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these pills before and these are not the same pills. A few of the same effects except the weight loss</li>
    <li> It works!  Believe me when I say... this stuff REALLY works!!!!!  I used to be an avid gym rat, but I hurt my knee, and was unable to workout for a while.  I became sedentary and of course I ate more, so I gained some weight all in the wrong places.  I then discovered this product and have been taking it on a 3-month on, 1-month off rotation and have seen dramatic results (all without working myself to death in the gym)!  My knee is about 80% healed, so I plan to get back in the gym real soon... I can only imagine my body&#x27;s metamorphosis when I combine the two!  Try it, you can&#x27;t go wrong!    Good Luck and Best Wishes!</li>
    <li> I tried the 2 Day Diet Lingzhi pills about 2 months ago and found they worked quite well! After reading the remark on how to recognize &#x27;real&#x27; vs. &#x27;fake&#x27; pills I placed an order through Amazon - guess what; Ted&#x27;s pills are the real thing! Last year in July I changed my job from 10 hrs of intense walking (weighing 112 lbs) to 10 hrs of (also intense!) sitting a day + weight gain to 135 lbs! Without counting calories and changing my food intake, and without exercising - in less than a month I dropped my weight to 124 lbs!&lt;br /&gt;I experienced absolutely no side-effects except - unbelievable thirst and suppressed appetite! Oh, bless...&lt;br /&gt;And because of drinking so much of water, my complexion improved, my hair is shinier... Can&#x27;t complain!&lt;br /&gt;I have no choice but to recommend the 2 Day Diet Pill! Works magic for me, hope it does the same for you...</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT ISSUCK, I REPEAT AGAIN THIS PRODUCT IS SUCK.  I WISH I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK. IT DOESNT WORK AT ALL!!!!!!! BE CAREFUL      PLS TRY THIS ONE :    Better Alternative to 7 Days Herbal Slim. \\&quot;Magic Slim\\&quot; Fat reduction: suppresses appetite: Speed up the metabolism: This unique formula boosts 3 essential benefits: Fat reduction: Fat elimination: 24 Hours Fat burning: Speed up the metabolism.</li>
    <li> like the title says, 2 orders, 2 diffrent bottles, sometimes seems like it works, sometimes not. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Last year a friend introduced this product to me and it was fantastic!  Well I took the product for about 5 months off and on and lost a total of 25lbs....with a little exercising.  Well this summer i ordered the product and it did nothing at all, so i tried ordering another box to see if it was something wrong, but i purchased 2 boxes and nothing has happened....in fact i gained a few pounds and that&#x27;s with exercising.  Last year I took them and with little efforts of eating right and exercising and lost, this year I took them with more efforts of eating better and exercising and nothing....I don&#x27;t know what happened or where the product went wrong but now im looking for something else to take...maybe the product will work for someone else but not me or maybe i got too immune to them i don&#x27;t know but either way i never had side effects like i normally do with diet pills and that&#x27;s why i wanted to keep taking them but unfortunately they r not for me anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased these before &amp; have taken them for over a year.  I know which ones are the real thing &amp; which aren&#x27;t. These work!  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just want to say that these pills really did work. I was a little skeptical, but I actually saw a difference. I saw a change after 3 weeks of use in the stomach an thigh area. I was really surprised. dont&#x27; know if I lost weight because i didn&#x27;t weigh myself but I definitely see a change. and it does change your eating habits, u do eat less.</li>
    <li> I received the 2 day diet later than expected which I didn&#x27;t like, however, things happened so no big deal.What is important is that I received it and it works!!</li>
    <li> Not pleased with product. Did not decrease appetite as stated. Have not lost any weight since I have been taking the product.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I lost 6 lbs in my first week!  If you don&#x27;t mind some discomfort you will be fine.  Made my stomach ache 24/7, but it definately makes you want to eat healthy which is very important in weight loss.</li>
    <li> Not only did i receive it in a timely manner but they also sent me a two samples of the tea. I Would definitely purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased both with the overall transaction and the product. I will definitely buy from this seller again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nothing else even compares I been takin this for a year now. I started at 220 now Ian only 145. No jitteriness no side effects what so ever. Just pure fat loss!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product 6 months ago...at that time I was only taking 1 pill everyother day and I went from 211 lbs to 192lbs. A few months passed and I tried buying another bottle and realize that they were not the same...I kept searching and came across this seller here on Amazon and decided to give it a shot....THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL!! I&#x27;m so happy!! I reccomend this product to anyone having trouble loosing weight!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of months and have seen good a difference in my body.  One of the ladies at work used it for 3 monthes and lost 20 pounds.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to let everyone know since I started taking these pills in October of \\&quot;09\\&quot;I went from 39 inches around my waist line down to 28 inches I can finialy fit into my size 3&#x60;s and 5&#x60;s again .I was so amazed about this product.I recommended a lot of my friends family about this product and now they are all on the 2 day diet pills and also are seeing a change.Now if u continue taking this product and u do not see a change, then u do need to stop taking this product for at least 2 weeks and then start back on the pills and u will continue to loose more weight and inches , the reason some people r not noticing any weight drop is because ur body is so used to this product and u do need to take some time off, and then restart taking the pills all over again, and u will continue to loose weight and inches.believe me that is the trick , because I did notice I was not dropping or loosing any thing, so then I stopped taking the pills for 2 weeks and just started back on them and now feeling the way I did when Ifirst started taking this product ,with no appetite what so ever .Some people do not see a change after a month especially if u are over weight,after taking this product u will notice lots of inches coming off and legs and thighs will also slimm down as well then u will see a tremendous of weight coming off u .What I did , I took a before picture and after the first 3 weeks I did and others as well noticed a big difference .So this product I give it A+100%</li>
    <li> HI I PREVIOUSLY WEIGHT 139 LBS. AND JUST COULN&#x27;T GET RID OFF THOSE LITTLE EXTRA POUNDS I HAD GAINED DUE TO PREGNANCY. I&#x27;VE BEEN TAKING THEM FOR 3 WEEKS AND HAVE LOST 10 LBS. I DID GET MINOR HEADACHES AND I GET THIRSTY OFTEN BUT OVERALL I CANT REALLY BLAME THE HEADACHES ON THE PILLS BECAUSE MY JOB HAS ALOT TO DO WITH IT.I TAKE BEFORE BREAKFAST EAT LUNCH AND HAVE A SMALL MODERATE DINNER, NEVER REALLY HAVE TIME TO EXERCISE BECAUSE OF MY TWO KIDS SO I WOULD SAY IT REALLY HAS BEEN HELPFUL TO HELP ME SHED THOSE EXTRA LITTLE POUNDS I HAD LEFT FROM MY PREVIOUS PREGNANCY.</li>
    <li> I got the product very quick!  Seller was awesome.  I would recommend product and seller.</li>
    <li> ordered two bottles of this.  Ready to dispute payment. Ive taken these for a very very long time.  I got these bottle looked the same but so far no results arent workin like the ones before. i workout and diet and take these to help and ive lost significant.  These i can tell are not the same they are not havin the same effects as the others. its like nothing.  Shipping was quick tho and that was the only plus but i am goin to try to get a refund! in these times i cant waste a dollar on fake merchandise. weather they know its fake or not i dont know.</li>
    <li> This product is not authentic Japanese 2 Day Lingzhi.  There are several websites you can go to in order to spot a fake, and the biggest thing is the bottom of the bottle.  The authentic product bottle has no seam on the bottom of the bottle, or is has a seam and markings on BOTH sides of the line.  If your product has a seam and markings on only one side of the line, you have a fake.  This one is fake and does not work like the original.  Do not waste your money.  The only seller that had the real stuff was Mr. Bargain and he&#x27;s not currently selling any.  And the real stuff works; I lost 20 lbs in 2 months.</li>
    <li> I AM 40 YEARS OLD AND I TAKE THIS PRODUCT. MY DAUGHTER IN-INLAW TOLD ME ABOUT IT SHE HAD LOST 25 POUNDS VERY QUICKLY. SO I DECIDED TO TRY THEM AND I LOST 25 POUNDS IN 3 MONTHS TOO. WHAT I NOTICE ABOUT THEM FIRST IS THEY DIDN&#x27;T MAKE MY HEART SPEED UP. THEN I NOTICE INCHES COMING OFF BEFORE I SAW THE POUNDS GO AWAY. IT WAS LITERALLY MELTING MY FAT AWAY, MY LEGS AND THIGHS ARE AMAZING. SO I TOLD MY 60 YEAR OLD MOTHER ABOUT THEM AND SHE LOST 10 POUNDS IN 2 WEEKS. I ALSO HAVE MY SISTER IN-LAW TAKING THEM AND SHE ALSO LOST 10 LBS. SO FAR I AM STILL LOSING WEIGHT AND THEY ARE TERRIFIC.[[ASIN:B002IVHMUK Magic Slim BETTER THAN 2 DAY DIET]][[ASIN:B001OT203G 2 DAY DIET ORIGINAL JAPAN VERSION LINGZHI SLIMMING FORMULA]]</li>
    <li> 3 years ago I weighed 375 pounds. Within 1.5 years I dropped down to 145!!! This was with VERY DANGEROUS pills. Please do not try them. I began having horrible heart palpitations and dizzy spells. Ended up in the hospital with no memory of how I got there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I had to stop taking any pills that increased your heart rate. For the past year and a half I have slowly gained weight. I tried all those carb blockers, those EVIL alli pills, and nothing worked. My hunger kept increasing and I kept gaining. Now, 3 weeks ago I weighed 195lbs. My hair dresser told me about Lingzhi and suggested taking the pills AND tea for best results. As of this morning I am now 184!!! My stomach is getting flatter and my appetite is gone. I have to remind myself to eat and when I do it is just a little bit at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews, some people talk about \\&quot;fake pills\\&quot;. I ordered through that 2daydiet seller for both. The pills are dark red and have a strong herb smell, bottom of the bottle is the number 1. Are they real? I do not know if they are authentic but they are working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is some advice for those looking to try these pills. Do not overdo it. It says to start with one pill once a day and if no reactions then 2 pills once a day. I only take one because.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW do you need to poop first thing in the morning. It is not like with the alli where you get those awful stomach cramps at all different times of day. It is once a day in the morning. It feels like my system really is flushing any excess waste. Is it expelling fat like it claims? Hard to tell. According to my digital scale, of those 11 lbs lost so far, only 2 are from fat. The rest is water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to drink lots of water and try to follow a healthy eating plan. You will never find a \\&quot;magic pill\\&quot; that will allow you to eat all you want and lose weight. If you&#x27;re going to eat pizza, chips, ice cream, and cookies, you will NOT lose any weight. If you take these pills and drink the tea AND change your eating habits then you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be lazy! Pills aren&#x27;t cheap, so why waste your time and money if you&#x27;re not going to change your diet?e your eating habits then you will.    Don&#x27;t be lazy! Pills aren&#x27;t cheap, so why waste your time and money if you&#x27;re not going to change your diet?</li>
    <li> I never thought it would do much to help my diet and I am very pleased to report it helped a lot.</li>
    <li> I have purchased these pills before from a different seller and they worked wonders. When it came time for a refill I mistakenly ordered them from this seller....and they seem very different. They don&#x27;t smell like the first ones I had and they also don&#x27;t curb my hunger the same way. I think they must be the fake versions. I would not buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Excellant !  first product that has worked for me easily. My problem is mindless snacking &amp; it definately curbed my cravings. I have lost 3 1/2 lbs in 11 days. Its not a ton but on track with the average user. What matters is my husband has noticed &amp; is pleased with my results thus far.  I really helps you control your appetite &amp; you end up eating the portions you should be eating. I find it great that it has worked even through this holiday snacking time. I had my share of sweets.  The first day you definately notice it working, I felt so stuffed when I tried to it something small. Now the feeling has leveled off but still &amp; I dont get hungry. I know I can stick to this pace &amp; hope to reach my goal soon. Its even helped my nasal allergies. Must be the herbs? Its worth the try.</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, this product is the authentic version. When I opened the bottle, it had a strong earthy smell, just like reviews said it should. My friend ordered the same product from another seller and her pills smelled of plastic. We opened a capsule of her pills and one of mine to compare the contents. These pills smelled herbal and had yellow contents with flecks of red and brown powder. Hers were just a chunky tan colored powder without sent. I started taking these pills about 12 days ago and have successfully lost 6-8 lbs (varies depending on how much I have eaten and how much water I have had). The pills do give me a bit of the jitters so I have only been taking one a day instead of the recommended 2 a day. I can&#x27;t drink extra caffeine though or I will feel like I am on crack. However, the pills don&#x27;t make me lose my appetite. I still get hungry like normal, but the difference is that I only eat a fraction of what I normally do before feeling full. Also, be aware that this does make you very thirsty and dry-mouthed, which is OK because it jsut causes you to drink more water. However, you do have to use the bathroom a whole lot more! I suggest these pills from this buyer. Be careful about buying them from another supplier. They could be fakes.</li>
    <li> I loved these pills at first. Lost the rest of my baby fat and was happy. I stopped using pills when I felt they were not really working anymore and my body started breaking out in awfully huge pimples, that would not go away. Two things happened. 1. I gained more weight then what I started with. From 127lb I went down to 118 lb, stopped taking when I noticed that I was 124 so thought pills were no longer working. Went up to 137 and almost cried since I could not fit in most of my work close. Huger kicks in with the vengeance. I am now hitting the gym, and watching what I eat. If I knew I&#x27;d gain all back and then some, I wouldn&#x27;t have taken these.   Make your own choices, but remember, you will not be taking these pills forever;)</li>
