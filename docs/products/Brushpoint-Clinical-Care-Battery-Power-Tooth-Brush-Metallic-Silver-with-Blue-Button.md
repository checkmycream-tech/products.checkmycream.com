      <li>This a a great toothbrush for kids and teens as well.</li>
      <li>Happy Brushing! :)</li>
      <li>but all in all its good for the price.</li>
      <li>Came with its own batteries always a plus, and still working as if I just opened up the package.</li>
      <li>Nice toothbrush, very cheap and works well.</li>
      <li>Good toothbrush, pretty good price, and it achieves its mission in getting your teeth clean.</li>
      <li>This toothbrush started ok, then started to lose power after a week.</li>
      <li>The packaging and extra brushes seemed to make this an especially good value.  </li>
      <li>I bought about 20 of these because the last ones I bought from brushpoint were superb.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s working great</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>Like most cheap toothbrushes, this is normal.</li>
      <li>In a word, a good idea that simply does not work.  </li>
      <li>is full oxide at 25 days does not seal, and stops working interructor</li>
      <li>they either never worked at all or stopped working relatively quickly.</li>
      <li>I just recently purchased this product and I am very pleased with it</li>
      <li>Not even worth for its price.</li>
      <li>I have several and this one is a pretty nice toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I will say this... that motor is super strong and if I am not careful I get a tad bit dizzy.</li>
      <li>I decided to try these because of the sales price I will compare to my favorite brand the $6.00 Oral-B with only one head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first, I thought that it was just the batteries, but I changed them and it still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I just recently purchased this product and I am very pleased with it so far.</li>
      <li>Then when you really need to use it, it does not start anymore.</li>
      <li>The old heads I have look similar, but do not work on the new one.&lt;br /&gt;The new one has been working okay so far.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the seller.</li>
      <li>I thought maybe the batteries are gone, but changing to the new batteries did not help.</li>
      <li>Its ok, I like the fact you get extra brush heads, but its not very powerful..</li>
      <li>This is the first and the last time I am buying a electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Next time I will read reviews first.</li>
      <li>My initial take on this toothbrush was quite positive.  </li>
      <li>The pulsating brush left a clean feeling and I was looking forward to using this brush for a long time.</li>
      <li>The heads or soft</li>
      <li>I have returned to using the old toothbrush and my gums are recovering...</li>
      <li>The heads are soft so they don&#x27;t make your gums sore.</li>
      <li>It was a gift for my eight year old grandson who loves it.</li>
      <li>It did arrive early &amp; packaged well.</li>
      <li>that the whole thing simply slipped out of my hands and fell.  </li>
      <li>I now realize that this does not massage my gums as old battery powered toothbrush did.  </li>
      <li>This is actually the first time that I can recall (and I have been using battery powered brushes for a long time)</li>
      <li>This got frustrating pretty quickly</li>
      <li>But I found these on Amazon and was surprised for two extra brush heads along with the brush.</li>
      <li>When dry the handle felt like it had a decent grip</li>
      <li>This came nicely packaged, worked for nearly a week and revealed enough design flaws to make it unlikely that I will request a replacement to try again.</li>

<li> this cleans my teeth like any other spin-brush style toothbrush.</li>
<li> and I do not drive anything going down the stack</li>
<li> A previous user tossed this brush when he had to find the sweet spot on the power switch and hold it down to get the unit to stay on (a task rendered nearly impossible given the slippery handle).  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay for a child who looks forward to brushing now.</li>
<li> plus that sounds less than oral b, but 2 batteries is not good.</li>
<li> It slowly started quitting on me and now no longer comes on.</li>
<li> I used other expensive battery powered brushes along with my family.</li>
<li> With compared to other expensive ones I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
<li> Quality is not good.</li>
<li> I will simply have my money refunded if it does not work out  :-(</li>
<li> This was the absolute worst.</li>
<li> However, I soon discovered that the ergonomics were poor.  </li>
<li> Now it doesn&#x27;t work when I press the button, but will randomly turn on during the day.</li>
<li> I guess they were a product of cost cutting.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this bad boy for awhile now</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I just recently purchased this product and I am very pleased with it so far. It came with 2 extras brush heads &amp; for the price it is a great deal. The heads or soft so they don&#x27;t make your gums sore. It did arrive early &amp; packaged well.</li>
    <li> ...after a few days it would no longer stay on and I would have to keep the button pressed down (after finding the exact area where it would allow the brush to run) in order to use it.This got frustrating pretty quickly and I have decided to toss it.</li>
    <li> I have had the tooth brush not even a month and it has quit working. It slowly started quitting on me and now no longer comes on. I have had the same typical problems that I now see others have wrote in their comments.  thought this was a great deal but now I see you get what you pay for. Next time I will read reviews first. I am now waiting on a replacement. i will see how that one works out but I&#x27;m pretty sure I already know....lol&lt;br /&gt;Next I will simply have my money refunded if it does not work out  :-(</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t have spinning . this only vibrate. battery only last for 2-3 weeks. Not even worth for its price.Quality is not good.</li>
    <li> Excellent bor the money.  No need to leave charger on the sink to recharge</li>
    <li> This toothbrush started ok, then started to lose power after a week. When it totally stopped working after 2 weeks, I replaced the batteries. Now it doesn&#x27;t work when I press the button, but will randomly turn on during the day. I am throwing this piece of garbage out.</li>
    <li> My family has been using this brand for over five years.  I ordered extra heads online a few years ago because the devices lasted a long time.  I ordered this one as a replacement for one that finally died after a few years.  The old heads I have look similar, but do not work on the new one.&lt;br /&gt;The new one has been working okay so far.</li>
    <li> Nice toothbrush, very cheap and works well. It comes with extra brush heads. With compared to other expensive ones I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> It came with 2 extras brush heads &amp; for the price it is a great deal. The heads are soft so they don&#x27;t make your gums sore.</li>
    <li> I bought about 20 of these because the last ones I bought from brushpoint were superb. I could not find my previous model and this model was a little different but i thought no big deal. This was the absolute worst. I&#x27;ve been thru 17 of them and they either never worked at all or stopped working relatively quickly. I guess they were a product of cost cutting. Well I will definitely go somewhere else for the next batch.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my eight year old grandson who loves it. If it lasts six months,I will happily buy another. If it lasts longer, I will be amazed. From what I read, these (automatic toothbrushes) don&#x27;t have long lives. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for a child who looks forward to brushing now. You can&#x27;t go to a movie or have a meal for 6 bucks, including shipping, lol.</li>
    <li> My initial take on this toothbrush was quite positive.  The packaging and extra brushes seemed to make this an especially good value.  The pulsating brush left a clean feeling and I was looking forward to using this brush for a long time. It even came with a starter set of batteries.  However, I soon discovered that the ergonomics were poor.  The grip was beyond &#x27;slippery when wet&#x27;.  This is actually the first time that I can recall (and I have been using battery powered brushes for a long time) that the whole thing simply slipped out of my hands and fell.  When dry the handle felt like it had a decent grip but once it got wet it was almost unusable.  Then the power switch started to go.  A previous user tossed this brush when he had to find the sweet spot on the power switch and hold it down to get the unit to stay on (a task rendered nearly impossible given the slippery handle).  Had he stayed with it for a bit longer he would have found that the switch gave out altogether save for intermittant bursts of on if the button was bumped enough times.  In a word, a good idea that simply does not work.  I did not give the product a 1 star rating as my experience has been that people who give 1 star are those who just do not know how to use the product.  I reserve the 1 star for a DOA.  This came nicely packaged, worked for nearly a week and revealed enough design flaws to make it unlikely that I will request a replacement to try again.</li>
    <li> this thing only worked for 2 brushings then it started acting like it had variable speed control until it just gave out  i am going to try and get my money back</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working great, however the button seems to be going out on it. Like most cheap toothbrushes, this is normal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bad boy for awhile now and I must say.. though a lesser known name brand ... this cleans my teeth like any other spin-brush style toothbrush. Came with its own batteries always a plus, and still working as if I just opened up the package. Comes with two replaceable heads which is also a bonus.. in a nutshell? I dig. Oh baby I dig! LOL. Good toothbrush, pretty good price, and it achieves its mission in getting your teeth clean. I will say this... that motor is super strong and if I am not careful I get a tad bit dizzy. xP In the end, I&#x27;ve got zero complaints. Happy Brushing! :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two months.  I now realize that this does not massage my gums as old battery powered toothbrush did.  My gums have shrunk, exposing the nerves in some of my teeth.  I have returned to using the old toothbrush and my gums are recovering...</li>
    <li> I decided to try these because of the sales price I will compare to my favorite brand the $6.00 Oral-B with only one head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plus that sounds less than oral b, but 2 batteries is not good.</li>
    <li> I used other expensive battery powered brushes along with my family. But I found these on Amazon and was surprised for two extra brush heads along with the brush. I instantly bought seven pieces to give it to kids in my extended family. Excellent stuff. Highly recommend the seller.</li>
    <li> I have several and this one is a pretty nice toothbrush. I recommend it. This a a great toothbrush for kids and teens as well.</li>
    <li> Its ok, I like the fact you get extra brush heads, but its not very powerful..maybe if I change the batteries out that it came with that would help..but all in all its good for the price.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this product and I am very pleased with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;Packaged with 2 extras brush heads it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
    <li> After one month of working well, it started to act wired. The brush will be turned on in the middle of the night when nobody even touched it! Then when you really need to use it, it does not start anymore. I thought maybe the batteries are gone, but changing to the new batteries did not help.</li>
    <li> Greetings this product is pecimo remalo of the four I bought for my wife and I do not drive anything going down the stack is full oxide at 25 days does not seal, and stops working interructor not recommend-&lt;br /&gt;Saludos este producto es pecimo remalo de los cuatro que compre para mi esposa y yo no duro nada donde se pone la pila se lleno oxido a los 25 d&amp;iacute;as no sella, y el interructor deja de funcionar no lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when this toothbrush broke after just one week! It came with batteries and three cleaning heads. At first, I thought that it was just the batteries, but I changed them and it still didn&#x27;t work. I noticed that the on/off button no longer clicked on and off, so I bet that it has something to do with that. So it really sucks that I had to waste money on this and then just throw away the whole thing a week later, including all the brand new extra heads it came with. Oh well. This is the first and the last time I am buying a electric toothbrush.</li>
