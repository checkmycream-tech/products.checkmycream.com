<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> loved it. used it for my gel nails &amp; it worked wonders!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> this is very good nail remover and take off nails too. and it do not hurt the nails</li>
    <li> This is great! It removes the shellac within 5 minutes. Works exactly as it says. It did leak some during the shipping process.</li>
    <li> My sister tried this last night and it worked, but took at least 30 mins to an hour to get the Acrylic gel to dissolve off completely. When she did the second hand, she got impatient and decided to just file the rest off. I bought another one I&#x27;ll try when I have to money to get my nails redone. So I will write a review on that soon.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says</li>
    <li> nice size bottle for price.</li>
    <li> The product name is really misleading! &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; acetone has one believing it is straight acetone, which is great at removing tips. This is water and 5 other ingredients, not &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; acetone. It&#x27;s an ok polish remover but I didn&#x27;t purchase it for that. So, off to a beauty supply store. I do feel cheated.</li>
    <li> I do nothing but gel any more, but acetone through the largers brands is stupid expensive for what it really is.  This came quick to my house and the size is just perfect to hold me over for a while.  Obviously, its great with traditional polishes as well.</li>
    <li> Acetone is yellow/green and can stain the skin a bit. In the ad seems like bottle has pink hue to liquid.</li>
    <li> Works great to take off my Vinylux Nail Color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to say that the nail polish itself is an amazing product gets  polish even glitters off in seconds!!!! The thing I don&#x27;t like is the packaging ☹ it absolutely sucked. The top was not secured well it was loose and had a little piece of packaging tape over part of the lid. It spilt all in the plastic bag they delivered it in!!!</li>
    <li> REALLY SMALL for the money. Buy at the pharmacy instead--better value.</li>
    <li> I just love the way it removes the polish from acrylics I&#x27;m not into the gel nails but when that time comes I will edit to let you know what happens. I also ordered another brand to compare have nor gotten it yet but I hope it works as well.</li>
    <li> Works very good just dont smell it it it has a nail polish remover smell to it. Very good product</li>
    <li> great but smaller bottle than expected</li>
    <li> I wanted it for removig the normal nail polish and it works like a charm. I didin-t try with that other type.. The gel type that its stronger than the normal.</li>
    <li> I bought this aceton because I needed a shellack remover. It works great, I just put down my nails for about 30 seconds and after it&#x27;s just to take of the Shellack.</li>
    <li> Bought this to remove gel nails and couldn&#x27;t find locally. Worked perfectly</li>
    <li> Stuff is just what you need to remove gel nail polish.  You can put pieces of cotton in pieces of foil and wait a full 10 minutes (after scoring the surface for better penetration), or you can just use &amp;#34; Vip Beauty Shop 200 Pieces Nail Polish Gel Remover Foil Wraps &amp;#34; which are much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also removed the top on this bottle and replaced it with a sprayer head that fits - which was genius.  Now I just spray once or twice onto the pad in the VIP foils that I reuse over and over.  No more messy spilling and wasted product.  You could easily pick up a little travel spray bottle for the same purpose.</li>
    <li> This is good for soaking off those acrylic nails. I would buy again if need be. Much more potent then the ones at the store.</li>
    <li> Shipped on time, and this gets the job done better than regular nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;Very strong smell, I would recommend using in a well ventilated room. Does dry out cuticles and hands a lot. use a good moisturizer when you are through</li>
    <li> The bottle is smaller then I expected it to be. The product works just fine but I found it better just buying it in the store.</li>
    <li> Bought this product thinking it was an Onyx Professional Brand. The bottle looks like &amp;#34;Onyx&amp;#34; brand, I got confused. I wanted 100% acetone, but received a cheap generic nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what it says it is and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  The bottle is pretty standard and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with leaks or anything.  Not much to say about acetone.</li>
    <li> Works like it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> Best product in the market.</li>
    <li> Yes,  yes, yes!  l love when I get exactly what I was expecting!&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more out this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use when I put my Jamberry nail wraps on. It works perfect it helps to clear any oils that might be on my nails before I apply my wraps and helps them to stay firmly in place for about 2 weeks. I am so happy now. fmsshepperd.jamberrynails.com is where I get my wraps from.</li>
    <li> Smaller then I thought the product I use before, but next time will try and order the next size off.</li>
    <li> Totally acceptable.  Recieved it in the mail within 4 days. Has met my expectations</li>
    <li> This nail polish remover never fails to do good. It may turn your outer hand white for a moment but it does good when it comes to removing polish</li>
    <li> Need the maximum strength to remove gell nails easily.  This does work, but you have to soak nails 10 minutes before the polish begins to dissolve.</li>
    <li> Its exactly what you expect. Pure acetone.</li>
    <li> it is a grat product however it does have a really srong oder if you are not a fan of the oder this is not the product for you however it does an amazing job.</li>
