<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does a very nice job on white hair and have used it for years  I don&#x27;t use it everyday but on special occasions,,, it is kind of light a treat,,, weird huh ?</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo. It brightens my gray hair and leaves it clean and shiny.</li>
    <li> Works well to help to remove the things that gradually change grey hair to other colors like yellowish. Can be used daily without a drying out effect. Not heavy duty, though, so it does require more than one use to remove build up stains.</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I&#x27;ve used of tjis type.  It cleans well without drying my hair.  There is no build up of a blue tint.  I have very light silvery hair and the shampoo adds shine.</li>
    <li> Love this product! My hair is soft and the grays and whites look shinier than before.</li>
    <li> I had my brown hair bleached to be platinum blonde a few weeks ago, and my stylist told me to use a shampoo for silver hair.  Her first recommendation was for [[ASIN:B00AE9307M Matrix Total Results Color Care So Silver Shampoo, 10.1 Ounce]], which I purchased and was using, and then I found this Pantene product.  I was so impressed with how much better my hair feels after rinsing out this Pantene shampoo compared to the Matrix shampoo!  The former leaves my hair feeling like I could almost get away without using conditioner, while the latter leaves my hair feeling like tangled hay.  Not to mention the Pantene rinses out much better - I often could feel remaining lather left behind by the Matrix when I was applying conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist recommended leaving any purple shampoo in for a few minutes like I would with conditioner, to help the color really work.  I have found this to indeed be effective, as my hair has a definite silvery cast to it after using this.  For a much better price than what I paid for the Matrix, plus better results, I&#x27;m going to be using this Pantene product from now on.</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans without drying your hair out.  I would not trade this product for another product.  That is how much I love it.</li>
    <li> Well water prevents some sudsing, but the shampoo works as intended.</li>
    <li> Great for gray and platinum hair. It takes out the yellowish hue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion, leave shampoo on for about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> The product might be good, but with the pump mechanism not functioning and broken on arrival, it is a pain to get out.  When I feel like scooping it out with a qtip, I do like how well it applies and moisturizes</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo so happy Amazon sells it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my blonde looking......blonde. Brass free! Smells great, soft hair.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo for women who like a bit of a silver hint to their hair.</li>
    <li> Been using this produce for years.  Works very well for me.  I recommend Pantene Silver Expressions for silver haired Senior Citizens.</li>
    <li> Again I love this shampoo. It it great for grey hair.So happy to have found it again</li>
    <li> Perfect shampoo for my shade of salt &amp; pepper hair. It highlights the greys which shines bright in the sun &amp; leaves my hair full bodied....Great price @ amazon. NOTE; Very difficult shampoo to find in brick &amp; mortar retail.</li>
    <li> Pantene silver expressions gives my hair just the right amount of silver and shine. It also gives body to my fine hair. I get a lot of compliments now that I have found this product at Amazon. It is no longer carried in any of the stores in my town, so I am grateful for free shipping.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. My hair is going white, and some shampoos seem to turn my hair dull, or even yellow. This shampoo keeps it healthy looking and bright,</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It gives my hair fullness and shine that it never had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to make the grey hair sparkle and brings out the other blonde colors in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that they still made this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make my purchase last as long as I can.</li>
    <li> It has always resulted in complements on the silver shine.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!  Keeps my hair silver instead of mousy!</li>
    <li> I like it! I&#x27;ve tried both the Clairol and this and they both work well. But I can catch this on sale with coupons more often so it&#x27;s cheaper. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a purple tint to it which will help keep your hair from getting too yellow-brassy too quickly. I&#x27;m naturally golden blonde but I&#x27;d rather be silver blonde. I tint my hair periodically and use this to maintain the color between tinting. I actually use half this and half regular shampoo so I can stretch it out and make it go longer. It cleans as well as any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used so it&#x27;s good on that front as well.</li>
    <li> This is not a great product!  It leaves a residue on my hair and I find that it is uncomfortably stiff by the next morning.  I find that it lathers nicely but my hair is not clean feeling.  Since all hair is not the same it may work well for other but be aware that it is not for everybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not give the bright white appearance that I expect from this type of product.  I will be returning this and I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Will not buy this again.  Odd smell and neon purple color.</li>
    <li> I had used this in the past, and was very unhappy when they stopped making it.  I tried two other \\&quot;silver\\&quot; and a clarifying shampoo in other brands, and threw them away.  My ash brown hair with silver strands throughout was looking greige.  I was looking for another silver shampoo to try when I found Pantene had brought this back.  I ordered right away.  After one use of the shampoo and conditioner, my silver hairs reflected more light, and stood out more, and the rest of my hair looked shinier as well.  I hope they never sto making this again.</li>
    <li> Not as moisturizing as I expected.  Still searching for the right products for my mature graying hair.</li>
    <li> Love it, with it was more readily available locally.</li>
    <li> Compared to more expensive brands, this  has lots of suds and leaves my white hair...white, clean, manageable. I prefer this to other brands.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Cleans my silver/gray hair and does not leave it looking brassy or &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t be put put-off by the shampoo&#x27;s color, which is a dark purple.  Good product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> My Dad loves it and it makes a great &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34;... His hair looks very healthy and shinny!!&lt;br /&gt;Better than ever!</li>
    <li> Have been using it regularly; haven&#x27;t noticed much (if any) change. Too bad--I had great expectations.</li>
    <li> If you want healthy looking gray/white hair this is for you.</li>
    <li> Hope that they dont take it off the market again. Just love it. Great for gray hair. Also love the conditioner.</li>
    <li> my sister loves and mother love this shampoo</li>
    <li> This is not your grandmothers purple shampoo / conditioner.  My blonde hair is in the transition to gray and I decided that I dont want to color anymore, but need something to brighten my hair and bring out natural highlights.  This shampoo fits the bill!  I have purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and I couldnt be more pleased.  I absolutely love this stuff.  Its easy and healing on your hair, leaves it soft and with wonderful highlights.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for my &#x27;silvered&#x27; brown hair, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in the local stores. Very happy to find it at Amazon and better yet to discover I was getting 2 bottles! I hadn&#x27;t noticed that when I ordered it and was more than willing to pay $10 for 1 bottle. It was very well packaged, no chance of spilling or breakage. I think it adds highlights to the grey in my  hair But won&#x27;t swear to it, but it is a very nice shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I let my hair go grey about one year ago, and this shampoo was recommended to me. I was able to purchase it at Walmart, and my local Walmart stopped carrying it, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. It leaves my hair soft and very shiny.  The grey color is very bright, and I don&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; color in my hair.  I think it is a great buy - the price is good.  I also use a Pantene conditioner, which is not the one which comes with this shampoo.  Because I have short hair and use very little conditioner, and the one I have has lasted me a very long time.  I also purchased the conditioner that comes with this shampoo, and will start to use it once the one I am using runs out, so I can&#x27;t comment on the conditioner that comes with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo came 2 in a pack for a great price.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores so decided to get it from Amazon.  I love this shampoo it doesn&#x27;t cause a purple tint like some shampoos do if you use it every day.  At least that&#x27;s what my hair stylist said.  My white hair is shiny and beautiful.  I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few complements on it.  Highly recommend giving this brand a try.  Price is great and does what it claims.</li>
    <li> I previously asked the owners about this product, because I have bleached hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to turn silver. As we all know, there is no silver hair dye- you have to bleach to ash blonde and then apply a blue/violet-based toner.&lt;br /&gt;No one answered my question properly so I went to walmart and bought a bottle for $6 or so..&lt;br /&gt;OMG.&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT GRAY, no joke. I have used Wella brand Ash blonde toner, as well as Shimmer Lights purple Shampoo and so far nothing has given my hair the truly natural, silver/gray look better than the Pantene Silver Expressions. It literally took my hair from pale yellow to gray in one wash. BY SAYING THIS: I mean a natural, washed-out gray that you would get if you were blonde before and THEN had gone gray with age. This will not make your hair blue/purple or extremely silver like Shimmer Lights does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its&#x27; only about $2 cheaper than shimmer lights these days, but I will definitely be soon investing in the silver expressions conditioner, too because it worked so well!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t review on what it does to naturally gray hair. Or naturally blonde hair, but for those people trying to achieve naturally-looking gray hair .. this is CERTAINLY worth a try. . .I just can&#x27;t believe I could have saved myself the $30 on 2 wella toners, 2 bottles of purple shampoo and 1 bottle of purple conditioner and simply got this pantene. Hindsight, I guess.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> Bought this with the silver shampoo and didn&#x27;t notice any discernable difference in brightness. As with the shampoo, it was just okay.</li>
    <li> Pantene Silver Expressions was not available for awhile.  I tried every other silver hair shampoo I could find including the expensive salon brands and was never satisfied.  This shampoo removes any yellowish residue from your hair which can accumulate from product use.  I hope it works as well for other gray, platinum and silver hair people.  Oh, and I am now receiving compliments on my hair since I began using Silver Expressions shampoo again!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it at Walmart so I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have white hair &amp; this shampoo keeps it that way.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo for gray hair. Really makes hair sil.very.</li>
    <li> I started off really liking this shampoo and conditioner. I am a Pantene fan. I have had grey hair for many, many years with no yellowing until I started using this shampoo for about 4 or 5 months. I don&#x27;t understand what happened. I started searching on internet about grey hair and purple shampoo; found many people saying not to use it every day, only once or twice a week. I was using it everyday. I have since quit using it and went back to regular Pantene shampoo and conditioner. I will try using it again when I can grow the yellowing out of my hair, but only once or twice a month.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for several years, as did my husband and it was just fantastic for very gray or somewhat gray hair. However, I had&#x27;t been able to find this at my grocery or drug store for over a year, so I had my hairdresser find me a \\&quot;gray hair\\&quot; shampoo and my husband and I really haven&#x27;t liked it. I thought I&#x27;d try to find Pantene&#x27;s Silver Expressions at Amazon and am so happy they have it. Now my husband&#x27;s hair will, again, be shiny silver and NOT purple! I have less gray, but it really shines it up. Great product and look forward to using this again! We also use just once per week.</li>
    <li> I was ecstatic to be perusing Amazon today and find this Product was BACK!! I was searching Amazon...wondering WHAT NEW PURPLE SHAMPOO was I going to test drive now that I had run out of the Shiny Silver Ultra that I usually got at either Sally&#x27;s or Amazon...but noticed a steep $2.00 price jump from the last time I purchased it on Amazon.  I turned to that shampoo out of SHEER DESPERATION when Pantene took away my old trusty Silver Expressions. You see, this 45 y/o silver headed white woman doesn&#x27;t like change...of any kind.  I don&#x27;t like it when the pharmacist changes the color of my meds...I don&#x27;t like it when there is a detour on my USUAL route...and I don&#x27;t like it when I CAN&#x27;T GET my FAVORITE SHAMPOO!!!  Soooo GLAD it&#x27;s back!!!  It works.  It smells good and it makes my long, silver locks STAND OUT in a SEA of ladies that are still coloring theirs up...and THAT&#x27;S what I do like :)</li>
    <li> My Mom used to use a shampoo for silver hair and the company quit making it. I found this and she is sooo happy. The shampoo is bright purple. Mom warns that if you use it every time and don&#x27;t watch carefully, your hair will take on a purple tint. I haven&#x27;t seen any sign of purple. I just see beautful silver hair.</li>
    <li> I am 46 and have long kinky medium brunette hair that is about 30-40% gray.  Because my brunette is lightening with the gray in it and looking more yellowish, I was really wanting something to bring out a white highlight to hopefully keep my hair from looking yellowish by the mixture of hair colors.  After using this product for two weeks, I have been really disappointed.  My hair grew dryer and dryer by the day and I didn&#x27;t see any huge improvement in the gray hair I have being more brilliant.  The only thing I liked about this product was that after the first couple days of using it, I felt that it completely cleaned any products out of my hair.  If I could only shampoo a few times a week, that might be great, but I do work outside that makes me really dirty and sweaty so I really need to wash my hair daily.  This shampoo/conditioner was too harsh for that.  I&#x27;ll maybe use this once a week to clean out other products I like to use, but no more than that.  *** After using for a number of months, I am updating this review.  I actually have found that I like the shampoo and use it on a daily basis.  I had been using this in conjunction with the conditioner and it is the conditioner that was making my hair feel stiff and dry.  I use the shampoo daily now with a daily conditioner from Great Clips.  I am now satisfied with the shampoo.  I cant really say it makes my gray hair a lovely white, but perhaps that will become more evident as I gray more.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price , excellent product.</li>
    <li> Makes my silver sparkle.  I love this shampoo</li>
    <li> Love how much softer my hair is now!</li>
    <li> I have mostly silver/grey hair that unless I use a &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; shampoo, tends to become brassy and dull!  This shampoo cleans my hair and gives it a great shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any retail stores locally so thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Great value for hard to find shampoo for silver hair.</li>
    <li> What can I say this is great shampoo. People always notice my gray/silver hair. They always tell me how great it looks. Shinny and no yellowing. If you got to have gray hair you might as well make it work for you.</li>
    <li> this really works.  my hair is shinier than when i used conventional shampoo and is well mannered.  very pleased.  also using conditioner.  this will surprise when you see that it is purple but it does the job well.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Product just isn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
    <li> Grandmother enjoys this product because it prevents yellowing. A bit pricy, but helps keep hair smooth in conjunction with keratin treatments.</li>
    <li> very hard to find locally..  love this product</li>
    <li> It does the job. It has a nice lather. Haven&#x27;t noticed any brightening of my natural white hair. But it feels clean.</li>
    <li> One of the bottle&#x27;s lids was not screwed on tightly and it leaked a little.  Otherwise, I liked the products.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works awesome for gray or graying hair.  What  a difference!  I use the conditioner by Pantene also - and they work great together.</li>
    <li> Great product-I have used it for years !</li>
    <li> Not quite blue enough to counteract results of iron oxide in my white hair.</li>
    <li> works for my silver hair</li>
    <li> I love this product - no purple or blue tint on your hair</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo for gray hair.  I couldn&#x27;t find it for a year, it was discontinued, but now I see it in a new package and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The fragrance is not overwhelming, it leaves my hair shiny and silvery, the price is reasonable - it&#x27;s all good!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for white hair that I have found.  I like the feel of my hair when it is used.</li>
    <li> OMG  I am soooo glad Pantene started making Silver Expressions again and that Amazon carries it. We tried several other &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; shampoos when Pantene discontinued this but not were as good as Silver Expressions.  This dark purple shampoo leaves my hair silvery but not blue or purple.  It also cleans well.  I don&#x27;t have to scrub hard to work it in and it lathers well. I always purchase it from Amazon in the double pack.</li>
    <li> Shampoo makes my hair shine and conditions it pretty well.  Is there another conditioner for dry brittle gray hair ?</li>
    <li> Like the way it highlights my white hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother who has silver hair. She said she liked the way it cleaned her hair but it was too harsh on her scalp and gave her a rash. This may not affect anyone else but I will not be buying it for her again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful.  Rich deep blue color, nice lather, easy to rinse off and leaves my grey hair nice and clean and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side is that the packaging (specifically the cover) is not great.  When my two bottles arrived, both had leaked an amount of blue shampoo.  Fortunately the bottle itself is packaged within a plastic bag so the shampoo did not leak onto any of the other items in my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is reason to not buy the product because it&#x27;s a good product; I am writing this review in the hopes that P&amp;G personnel might read it to re-design their container/closure system</li>
    <li> I have greying hair and somehow this shampoo blends the colors and makes the contrast more subtle.</li>
    <li> Along with the conditioner, leaves white hair shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> A great clarifier and brightener for my fine silver WITHOUT stripping/drying it.It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> I have white/silver hair so I believe it is the best for conditioning my hair!</li>
    <li> Bought it with the conditioner, great job, tried everything else, this works the best ! No fuss an easy product !</li>
    <li> Like the silver aspect of this product. It leaves my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Turning 50 i decided to let my hair grow out its natural colr. My boyfriend tells me people pay big buck to have hair look like mine. I cut out all the colored hair and grew out natural. without this shampoo it looks old and dull. This brightens and takes the brassy greys and makes them look more like a professional highlight. Really loving my hair and will not be without this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Love this product and have not been able to find it locally.  Price was great and it treats my white hair gently plus helping keep the brassy tones away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I use as I have almost all white hair.  this keeps the yellow out.</li>
    <li> Love the softness of my grey hair from this Pantene product.  My hair seems to hold it&#x27;s shape better and longer between visits to my hair dresser.</li>
    <li> Helps keep the color tone down for hair that has been bleached and makes my hair easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I have a few gray hairs, but at 35 years old, I was recommended by professional hair stylist the Silver shampoo to keep up with my highlights, and blend in with the few gray hairs. Less chemical damage to my hair...more shininess to my long hairs</li>
    <li> Best whitening shampoo for dogs ever!</li>
    <li> Got the conditioner and shampoo reversed.  This is a good cleanser, but for color enhancing, doesn&#x27;t do much.  The conditioner is just ok.</li>
    <li> All my husband will use on his silver hair - keeps the &#x27;yellow&#x27; away!</li>
    <li> nice smell, leaves hair soft and full. great for gray hair and good texture...used it for many years now, allways very good</li>
    <li> Good for grey hair because it reduces residue - which sounds to me like something anyone would like. I switch with neutrogena occasionally mainly since i am paranoid about the &amp;#34;blue hair&amp;#34; look, though i have never gotten that with this product.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff!  However the packaging was not great.  Some of it spilled out because one of the bottles popped open.  Tighter packaging to prevent this would make it perfect!</li>
    <li> I quit coloring my hair over a year ago. Coloring my hair was expensive. Also, I hated the roots showing in between coloring. I am a swimmer and the first thing a hair dresser would comment on is the brassiness the pool water made my hair. Since using this shampoo I have no problem from pool water and my gray hair is nice and white. The shampoo is not drying (I use the Silver Expressions conditioner too) and I will continue to use it. I have been unable to find it in a store so Amazon keep selling this product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make any difference after using it</li>
    <li> I love this.  My hair tends to yellow and I want the frost to shine and be more white than yellow.  This shampoo and the conditioner helps me achieve the look I want.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this shampoo in the stores any longer. I just wish it was sold as a set of one shampoo &amp; one conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Clairol Shimmer Lights shampoo on my highlighted hair, but decided to try Pantene since it was not as expensive.  Now that I&#x27;ve decided to let my hair grow gray, I wanted to be sure to keep using this type of purple shampoo to combat brassiness.  In my opinion, the Pantene doesn&#x27;t  work as well as the Shimmer Lights, but it does seem to be more gentle on my hair.  I&#x27;ll probably go back to Shimmer Lights after I use all the Pantene.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was becoming impossible to find in my local stores so I was extremely pleased to find it on Amazon!  It keeps my salt-n-pepper hair from looking like butter-n-pepper.  I use it 2-3 times a week &amp; like the way it adds body to my fine hair. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Pantene in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to see if I could have the same results as Shimmer Lights but with the good smell of Pantene. This shampoo didn&#x27;t remove any brassiness. It is very watery and I end up using more than needed to try and get some of the purple tone to stay on my head. I will not purchase this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Love this for my natural silver hair.  I have streaks of natural silver hair that was yellowing really bad.  My hairdresser suggested this &amp; it works to heighten my natural silver highlights without yellowing.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this for white hair. He likes the effects the best of all other brands he has tried.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells good and makes my hair shinier than it was before started using.  I have a mix of brown and gray/white hair, and this shampoo has no effect on the brown hair.  The purple color washes out completely and does not stain the white/gray.  This is pretty much the only shampoo I use now.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! removes yellow build up from oils and residue of other shampoo and sweat....brings out highlights!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would mellow out the brassy tones after I bleached my hair blonde.  It didn&#x27;t help with that at all, but it was wonderfully gentle, smelled great and helped moisturize my hair.</li>
    <li> ILOVE BOTH THE CONDITIONER AND SHAMPOO, THEY KEEP MY HAIR WHITE AND NOT TURN OTHER COLORS.</li>
    <li> I had used this shampoo for quite few years; suddenly, for some unknown reason, it disappear out of the retailers I used to buy it from.  Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid etc.  For some reason they stop carrying it.  I love the fact that I found it in Amazon and for a lower price that I was accustomed to pay for.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo&amp; conditioner set due to the decent ratings from previous customers. I usually use an expensive salon hydrating shampoo ,Pureology,  which is also purple in color and has a light fresh scent. Pantene, however, has a strong smell, I associate with perm chemicals. After using this product twice, I noticed my shiny silver hair was dulling to a faded yellow and it made my scalp itch like crazy !  I&#x27;ll be going back to my tried and true Pureology Hydrate and returning this. Pantene needs to change up their formula and scent.</li>
    <li> I like the brand and the use for white hair, came out beatiful, lustrous and very smooth. I love it</li>
    <li> Keeps my silver grey hair sparkling.</li>
    <li> Benn using this product for several years. Always get compliments on my hair.  Have a hard time finding at Walmart where I always purchased.  Will oder online from now on.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve read where others complain it dyes hair purple--my response to that is, your hair must not be naturally grey. Have you bleached it or colored it in any way? Because this shampoo&#x27;s purple color shouldn&#x27;t be leaving any kind of color behind!&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally grey and silver hair (some shine, some don&#x27;t), and all this shampoo does is leave behind shiny, silky clean hair! I love this shampoo, and have been using it for years. I was sorry that Pantene stopped selling it in grocery stores, but elated once again when I found it here on Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried other more expensive products specifically designed for silver or platinum blonde hair, but this one works the best. It just so happens that it&#x27;s less expensive than the rest.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Pantene, for bring it back! Seems to me that with all the Baby Boomers greying up, there must be quite the market for this.</li>
    <li> Seriously, My grandmother used the washing product RinsoBlue to shine her grey hair! I used to color my chestnut color to keep me young. When there was more grey than brown, I stopped coloring &amp; tried the Silver Expressions. I love it. Everyone complements me on the color &amp; shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. By accident I found it on Amazon &amp; Bought a bunch of it, just in case. So glad to see it&#x27;s still around. I really like it &amp; use it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair in great condition and highlights what I would normally not feel is a flattering feature, gray hair!  Makes it shine and look very healthy.  Highly recommend.  Get both the shampoo and conditioner.  Gray hair can often look so coarse.  Not with this product</li>
    <li> Great product for gray or grayling hair, really takes the yellow out.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for gray or white hair.  Keeps it from turning yellow.</li>
    <li> I did not find this product to be very effective for brightening my light gray hair compared to other products I have tried. The shampoo is drying so I use it no more often than once a week and will not repurchase once I&#x27;ve used it up.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and the matching conditioner really work to keep my  silver/white hair from getting yellow streaks. I  attend water aerobics classes and my hair would be a yellowish color without regular use of this shampoo. All my local big-box stores and drugstores quit selling this product and I was very happy to find it still available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...smells great, leaves my silver/blonde hair nice and soft. Use it every other day or so...</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo with the hopes of it would get rid of the yellow in my hair.  But instead I got purple hair.  I have thick silver hair and left it on the appropriate time and the underneath of my hair turned purple.  I stopped using it and used a regular shampoo for over a month and still had purple hair.  I went to my hairdresser and he tried clarifing shampoo and it took some of it off but not all.  So here I am a 60 year old woman with purple hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several shampoos for grey or silver hair, all claiming to remove the yellow tinge that comes from impurities in the water.  Nothing has worked yet, and this shampoo is the same as the others.  My hair still has a yellow tinge, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good shampoo in general, my hair is in good condition, but that&#x27;s all. No other benefit.</li>
    <li> love it for gray hair</li>
    <li> I like all the Pantene products, especially this one.  It makes my grey hair shine and definitely took the dullness away.  Hope they continue to make it.</li>
    <li> helps highlight natural colors</li>
    <li> I wrote a review for the conditioner.  I ordered this for my Mom who is 63 and starting to go gray.  The shampoo and conditioner make her hair silky and shiny.  She has tried some other brands but I told her how much I love the Pantene Highlighting Expressions for blondes and she agreed to try it.  She loves this stuff.  I can&#x27;t find it at a brick and mortar store, so this is now on my wish list for when Mom needs more.</li>
    <li> Great for removing yellow,brassiness in my white hair. Doesn&#x27;t leave a purple/blue tint after use.Good price fast ship too.</li>
    <li> Dealing with a mid-life crisis going gray.  Decided to embrace the change and not dye my hair.  My wife told me that there are products made for grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did a search and found this one.  I do find my hair to be shinier and thicker so pleased with results.  Weird color of liquid.</li>
    <li> I have used Targent, which is very good but can&#x27;t be used everyday. Pantene is inexpensive and great for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I got this to get rid of the brassiness of the blonde highlights that I got. I bleached my hair several times (I know. I&#x27;m terrible, right?) and it was blonde to pale blonde. There were some areas where it was orangey so I decided to get this to get most of the brassiness out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the job. The paleish parts turned light gold while the brassier parts turned to a hay color. It lathers up really well and the shampoo is actually purple to tone out the yellow tones. You should bleach your hair really light if you want it to tone to a silver/white color. But if you already bleached it three times like I did (Yeup. I know.) and can&#x27;t really do anything more but tone out the brassy yellow and orange colors, this will be perfect. It also smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it came individually because the two bottles will last me forever haha. So if your whole head is brassy galore, this is so worth the money.</li>
    <li> So far satisfied with colour results...silver is starting to loom; or I wish so...too early to tell.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for dull gray hair. My husband and I both use this.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This product really made my hair look and feel good. Seeing the purple color when it comes out of the bottle is a bit disconcerting but the purple did not affect my hair color at all.</li>
    <li> I have just a few grays but decided I wanted to quit dying it but wanted to loose the tint from the semi-permanent dye I and been using.  This works well, leaves my grays shiny and my hair soft.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo for gray hair.  Adds moisture does not dry out the gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every 2 to 3 days.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t think of using any other shampoo after this.  My hair color is shiny and silver and I bought the conditioner that goes with it. Totally hooked.</li>
    <li> I had (please notice the word had) perfectly white hair using a dye free shampoo-did not matter the kind, just so long as it was dye free. I read the reviews and thought that I should take better care of my natural white hair. I bought two bottles of the shampoo 4 weeks ago. One week  goes  by and I notice that my ends are discoloring slightly. Nothing hugely noticeable, and I&#x27;m thinking hmmm?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks go by and I have fluorescent green hair. Now I am off to the salon to get clarifying treatments, and it lightens the green, but does not remove it entirely. So, Yesterday, I have to have the remaining green cut out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS SHAMPOO IF YOU HAVE WHITE HAIR. The pigments in the dye of the shampoo react to the chlorine in the water chemically and alter the color of you hair.</li>
    <li> It works well for brightening blonde hair and removing brassiness.  I use it a few times a week and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> Not only did this dull the shine of silver hair, but it also transformed the natural curls into a frizzy lifeless looking  mess. Usually when we don&#x27;t like human cleaning products, we turn them into shower cleaning products, but this is intensely colored so will likely not work to keep a shower looking white.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time</li>
    <li> So happy P&amp;G brought this product back. It makes my silver hair beautiful. Forget artificial color. This is the best time of my life and my hair looks it.</li>
    <li> I bought this silver shampoo  because I wanted something to tone my hair and  help it stay healthy.  I am not yet quite 25% grey and my hair can be brittle and dry- and is not in the best condition after two babies took their toll on it. I  found  that it did help the color quite a bit and it  is slightly less frizzy. However the shampoo is so dry that it&#x27;s hard to use on the ends of my hair and I  have to be really careful not to pull on my hair as I am working out through in the shower.  The conditioner works well to remedy that and I  like the conditioner.  I don&#x27;t  know if it has to  strip more of the oils to impart the color  correction,  but I will probably try another silver shampoo  to see if I can find one that is more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I ended up buying this at local store because it was cheaper.  My husband has silver hair, I have chemically highlighted hair with gray at temples. The shampoo and conditioner leaves hair very very soft and shiny.  Did not leave any purple residue in my highlights.  use once a week.</li>
    <li> This is a highly recommended daily shampoo for us &amp;#34;silver sisters&amp;#34;....I have found it next to impossible to find this in stores, so ordering it here is the easiest option.  A good lather to it and the companion conditioner is pretty good too, although I prefer something a little heavier.  I tend to go through more of the shampoo than the conditioner.  Leave it on a little while to get the full toning effect of the purple shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great product for natural silver or white hair.  Glorious body and shine.  So why does Pantene take it on and off the market and out of distribution.  There are enough silver foxes out there to carry it on the shelf.  But if you can&#x27;t get it locally, this pack was a bargain way to order, delivered to the home for a little less per bottle than the stores, when they had them. I mean, really, when you have a product that causes strangers to walk across the street to say how gorgeous your hair is (and I use nothing else but this shampoo and conditioner), why don&#x27;t you put it out there?  No more letters to Pantene, I&#x27;ll just get it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Really helped make my gray hair more controllable.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Great value!</li>
    <li> Pantene has a great Product for the Price.  I tried to find this product on our local stores and was told the Pantene no longer offered it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is impossible to find in local stores near my home.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  My hair looks great, has body, and I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> I confess I have only used once but it seems as though this tangles my hair less than some other brands. and speaking of other brands there are not so many out there for grey hair. Many stores do not stock these products (grey hair shampoos) or only stock one. I have tried several and you either have to use a ton of it or it leaves your hair really tangled. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find a shampoo for gray hair, and it also had a companion conditioner.  Together, they make my hair silvery gray and soft to the touch.</li>
    <li> The only product I have found that enhances my incoming silver.</li>
    <li> In combination with the Silver Expressions conditioner, or even by itself,  this shampoo gives the whitest parts of my hair more shine than  the Pantene Volume shampoo I&#x27;ve used for years. Don&#x27;t know why. The bottle only says it cleans dulling film, which I would think any good shampoo does. I like  it in combination with the conditioner--which seems to provide enough volume along with softness  The shampoo is a startling thin dark purple liquid, but it foams up white and I don&#x27;t have to use much each time--so it will not run out quickly. The shampoo makes my hair &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; in one wash, which I like.  By the way, the bottle says this is Pro-V, even though some descriptions don&#x27;t mention that.</li>
    <li> So glad this is back on the market. Makes my hair look beautiful. No yellow hilites.&lt;br /&gt;Get a  lot of compliments when using this product</li>
    <li> It was okay.  Did not do what it said.  My hair was not whiter, it looked dull.  Went back to other &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am a natural blonde. But I have a lot of gray hair coming in so I dye my hair with non-permanent hair color. I mix my own shade of blonde using Clairol Natural Instincts. The Natural Instincts shades tend to go a bit yellow on me, which I don&#x27;t like. This shampoo helps. It&#x27;s a nice clarifying shampoo that works well on both grey &amp; blonde hair color. It has a blue tint to it which neutralizes yellow. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great results - I found this shampoo to be perfect for me.  It highlighted my hair with the silver accents for my gray, and the texture of my hair was wonderfully soft after using.  The price was excellent.  For a very hard-to-find product, this is the answer!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my graying hair. Can&#x27;t say it has done anything to the color but makes my hair look nice and shiny and thick. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> If you have silver hair (or you&#x27;re ready to let it grow out), this is an EXCELLENT product.  The silver practically glows, plus your hair is so soft afterwards.  Try it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the best!! It brightens my silver hair and removes the yellow.  Gave all my other shampoos to my daughter because I don&#x27;t plan to use anything else but this product.</li>
    <li> Great product  good price  make hair feel soft would buy again when I run out a little shampoo goes a long way</li>
    <li> Did the trick for removing dullness, but was very drying.  A once a week use will do for me.</li>
    <li> great shampoo for gray hair makes it look silver</li>
    <li> On the fence about this one. Smells like grape bubblegum when you put it on, buy that doesn&#x27;t last thankfully. Nice lather, nice results.  Don&#x27;t know about actual shine. My biggest gripe, and the reason I&#x27;ll be looking for another shampoo, is the list of ingredients that goes on a mile. That can&#x27;t be good.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> Love this, keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I notice a difference with more shine in our grey hair. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Pantene is the best shampoo that I have found for my silver hair, I will always buy Pantene again and again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful. I live in a home with well water which makes my natural silver hair yellowish. Pantene Silver Expressions shampoo, removes that yellowishness.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need a lot to thoroughly clean your hair and leaves gray looking thick and natural. Buy this if you have gray hair and you want to look great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently decided to stop coloring my hair and let the grey grow in. Regular shampoos left me with coarse hair and an uneven color. This shampoo gives me soft, manageable beautiful grey and brown hair. I&#x27;ve not used any other brand but this is very affordable and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I decided to &#x27;embrace the grey&#x27; eight months ago. I didn&#x27;t want flat,dull looking hair, so I started using Pantene silver expressions. The shampoo and conditioner. It really brings out the silver and the shine. It leaves my hair soft and clean and manageable. I work with the public and I actually inspired several other ladies to embrace their greys as well. Good product, keep it stocked.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product smells, works and lathers. I don&#x27;t even need product because it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Shiny. Full. Not dry. I use it 5 days a week, no lavender tint.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my silver highlights bright, but not yellow.  It cleans well, but leaves no residue and does not dry the hair or scalp.  I have tried a similar product from Clairol, but was unhappy with the dry, frizzy result that came from their shampoo.  The price is very fair and since I have Amazon Prime - free shipping.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  I have very long mostly gray hair, and I like the scent, and my hair feels squeaky clean after use!</li>
    <li> Excellent seller and product</li>
    <li> Like many of the customers who have left reviews here, I was so upset when Pantene stopped making Silver Expressions.  I guess all those cards and letters we sent them must have worked because it&#x27;s BACK!  I have tried other products that claimed to bring out the shine in silver hair, but nothing works like this product.  I am PROUD of my almost totally silver hair and will never color it again, but I still want my wild curls to be beautiful!  I started getting compliments once again on my bright silver hair when I started using Pantene Silver Expressions again.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Our stores here in Kalamazoo Michigan carry this product only occasionally, and at a very high price.  This deal on Amazon gives me the product I love to use at a very decent price.  Thank you Amazon for this.</li>
    <li> I like this and have been using it for about a yr now. I cut out all colr and am growing out natural Tones down the grey and my hais is noit so brassy. Will keep buying</li>
    <li> My silver is silver. Love it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful on silver/gray hair. Great product. I have tried many and this one is my #1 choice.</li>
    <li> Used with shampoo.  Both seemed to flatten my hair a bit rather than add volume, which I sorely need.  I was also hoping for a little more color enhancement.</li>
    <li> The Pantene Silver Expressions Shampoo is just what I needed for my grey (white) hair.  The product has a nice scent and leaves my hair feeling and looking great.</li>
    <li> Ok as shampoo goes but does not provide the purple brassy fighting power I had hoped for. Pravana and Fudge are way better. I&#x27;ll spend extra to get the higher quality purple I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I use this as it does make my hair less stiff and bristly (the hair which remains on my head anyway). I have been unable to find this in any store here in the NYC area and finally went shopping online. Now I have this ordered for delivery every 6 months (not too much hair remember).</li>
    <li> He has gorgeous silver hair that was getting a little yellow.  Thanks to this product it is back to silver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shampoo so it cleans my hair all good. My hair does not turn purple. And the yellow tones seem less brassy after using this. If you&#x27;re really worried, I would try the sample sizes first- but I&#x27;ve had good results so far.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair look really white. Only need to use a little. Had used another brand and that made my head itch but this does not.</li>
    <li> I like the product and cannot find it in the store. thankyou for carrying this product. your service was great.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mother with her beautiful white hair. Gets a little yellow at times and this shampoo makes it white again!</li>
    <li> Hair was dull and lifeless, just like the commercial said it was...lol.  Anyway, to be serious here, the stuff works fantastic if you have silver or even gray hair.  Makes it silky smooth and shiny as possible.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is just as effective as I had hoped.  It leaves my gray hair shining and not lack luster.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a fine conditioner and works well with the shampoo...  it seems all the gray hair shampoo and conditioner products are purple.. not sure why, but it sure can be messy if I don&#x27;t rinse off the outside of the bottles!</li>
    <li> Does the job...clean hair!</li>
    <li> This works well but the color is VERY purple. Can&#x27;t imagine what dyes are in it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo  is amazing if you have silver hair.It makes it shine to!</li>
    <li> Love how the shampoo smells and makes my hair look.  Helps to cut down on the summer brassy sunshine on my sparkely grey/white hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those of us who prefer silver to dye.  Price was right and convenience could not be beat.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works wonders for hair that has been colored.  It keeps color vibrant and shiny.  The purple color of this shampoo keeps dyed blond or highlights from getting that brassy undertones.  It makes your hair so shiny and it is really one of the better shampoos I have used.  The price value on here is awesome compared to local B&amp;M stores around me and I love that I never had to leave my house to get it.  I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;ll turn to if this product gets discontinued, because I have come to rely on this product so much.  I just simply can&#x27;t praise it enough.  The fragrance that this shampoo has is also rather pleasant.  It also lathers up really well, rinses cleanly from your hair and leaves no buildup.  It really preserves color better than other brands I have tried.  If it wasn&#x27;t for new hair growth, I wouldn&#x27;t have to re-dye my hair for a very very long time.  I have no doubt you will love this shampoo as much as me so try it today!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s strictly for natural gray hair. I combine it with my regular shampoo. I do not use it straight.</li>
    <li> It removes dull and yellowing quickly with one quick shampoo.  It is moisturizing enough to leave my thick, natural African hair undamaged.  The deep purple color does the trick leaving my hair white/silver giving me a fresh salt and pepper look.  I use the shampoo in combination with its conditioner I commented on too.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Pantene Silver Expressions and it is almost impossible to find in the stores now.  I love the feel and shine it gives my hair.  Be sure to rinse really well.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, have been using this product for almost a year now and love the way Pantene works on my hair, definitely will continue its use..............great product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo (and conditioner)! My hair has never been softer and brighter with regular use of Silver Expressions--not a hint of yellow.  But my frustration is the now you see it, now you don&#x27;t experience that I&#x27;ve had.  Stores carry it and then they don&#x27;t; Pantene makes it and then they don&#x27;t.  I was spending far too much time searching out hair products!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thrilled to find the shampoo on Amazon and hope to see it here for a very long time.  Amazon, don&#x27;t let me down!</li>
    <li> I usually buy this in the local drug store or supermarket, but it&#x27;s no longer available there, so I bought it online without a problem, and it was actually cheaper.  The other reviews are correct - it does not turn my hair blue like some other shampoos..  It takes only a small amount, so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent for silver/grey hair but delivery method questionable. Both orders were received with tops partially open resulting in loss of shampoo into plastic bag. Translation: a purple mess that dripped all over my floor.  Solution: shampoo bottles need to be tightened better before shipping.</li>
    <li> I first tried Pantene Silver years ago - and when it went of the regular shopping shelves in the local stores, I was heart-broken.  Finding it on Amazon has been marvelous!  Pantene products in general provide gentle cleansing with shine - the Silver product goes further &amp; reduces any discoloration caused by hair styling products, as well as the yellowing that can sometimes accompany graying hair. If you&#x27;re looking for the cool gray and white of a brisk winter morning, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products for gray hair and none even came close to comparing with this one. Sad to say, I cannot find it for sale in any of the stores in our area, so I had to resort to purchasing it through Amazon. It leaves my hair soft when dry and very easy to comb through when wet- no tangles (as opposed to a similar product for gray hair which shall remain nameless). Silver Expressions also enhances the &#x27;silver&#x27; highlights in my hair. I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo.  It is a basic shampoo that leaves my gray hair clean and manageable.  I have always had good luck with Pantene products.  The price is really great from Amazon, especially as a Subscribe and Save deal.  It has been difficult to find the silver type shampoos (any brand) for gray hair at my local stores and this makes it so easy and cheap and I get a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of dying my hair. I have light brown hair but it&#x27;s ever more punctuated by grey and silver strands. As I look at all my friends who are suddenly blonds I feel a sense of rebellion which is what led me to try this product. I love it. It brings out the silver highlights in my hair and makes it almost look shimmery especially in natural light. I&#x27;ve often used Pantene shampoos and been happy with them and this formula gives the same superior performance with the added ability to highlight. When I first used it I was a little dismayed at how runny it was and that it&#x27;s PURPLE! When some got on the shower walls I was afraid it would be permanent. It wasn&#x27;t. It washed off easily. I&#x27;m not sure how this stuff works but it does and I love it. Come on folks...reclaim your maturity. Go natural, at least in terms of hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Your mileage may differ but I&#x27;ve searched my local Los Angeles stores and can&#x27;t find this product which is why I wound up buying it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It does an okay job, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to brighten your hair any and it makes it very heavy.</li>
    <li> Excellent rinse for keeping silver hair silver instead of brassy cotton.  Shampoo&#x27;s also good in this line.  It would be nice if they came in the traditional &amp;#34;2-in-1&amp;#34; Pantene formulation for I&#x27;m happy with this in the meantime.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo...BUT the second time I ordered I only received ONE of the TWO bottles in the order. Because it is an Add-On item I&#x27;m finding that reporting the missing bottle is not easily done.</li>
    <li> Terrific price and shipped right to my door!</li>
    <li> Love the way this product makes my hair feel.  And so many people comment on how shiny the gray in my hair is.  Impossible to find anywhere else anymore but on Amazon.com - so I keep a supply on hand in case it goes away for good.</li>
    <li> Always my favorite product for years!  This conditioner takes the drab out of your gray and really give it a beautiful shine!  Strongly recommend this to family and friends!</li>
    <li> Like the color and it perks up my silver/gray and makes it pop! I&#x27;m salt and pepper at the moment.</li>
    <li> I am proud of my long silver hair!  This product shines it up and knocks out any yellowing.  In other words...it works and you don&#x27;t have to use a hand full.</li>
    <li> For swimmers that don’t color their hair the Silver Shampoo is a necessity. The silver Shampoo should be widely available in stores. If any of the Pantene sales reps read this:&lt;br /&gt; “please, put it back!”&lt;br /&gt;Keep in touch</li>
    <li> i love this product.  i won&#x27;t have to look for the perfect shampoo anymore.  my hair is white and shiny.</li>
    <li> Does what it says very good product</li>
