<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just like all the other Eminence products,this is wonderful!! It smells so great as well!!! I will never use any other products!! These are the best products!! I eve got my daughters using them, and they love them too!! I just wish I would have found them along time ago!!</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product.  I will forever continue to use Eminence.  It is natural, organic and homemade. I highly recommend the entire line. It matters what we put on our body.</li>
    <li> My skin drinks it up, especially as the air gets dryer in the winter.  However I must say that while it is pleasant, something about the fragrance bothers my bronchi.</li>
    <li> This is THE best toner I have ever used!  Not only is it 100% organic and is never tested on animals, it smells so nice and is very soothing to mature, sensitive skin. After a few applications, there is a noticeable improvement n skin tone and texture.  I&#x27;m 68 and I get compliments all the time on how pretty my skin is.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I am on my third bottle.  Really great for winter skin.  My spa using Eminence exclusively and I was introduced to it there.</li>
    <li> Hydrating and a lovely scent.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to on a hot day!  A quick spritz and I&#x27;m calm and cool.  Fragrance is pleasant and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I am no stranger to Eminence products and as such it&#x27;s a bit hard to figure out which product exactly is helping because I use many. That said, I believe in layering of products for extra benefits and using the Neroli Toner is a step in that process for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few of Eminence&#x27;s toners and I really like them all, but based on the ingredients and my goals of anti aging (I&#x27;m 38), I am drawn to the Neroli toner. It&#x27;s refreshing, smells great, and feels great. I use it after cleansing and also a brief spritz to set my makeup after I&#x27;ve put my makeup on. I also live in a dry climate that gets extra hot in the summer so I use it to refresh my skin throughout the day. It&#x27;s great for this. I recommend this toner and all of Eminence products. Non toxic ingredients that you can feel confident using for both health and effectiveness reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I also want to take a moment to address some possible concerns about Eminence products coming and they look like some is missing. I received one, the Microderm pear scrub. I opened it up and it looked like product had shifted so much that some was missing as some have complained in buying eminence products. Well, I tested it by scooping it all out and weighing the amount of product. It amounted to the proper 2 ounces. Therefore, there was none missing and it had merely shifted during transit to the point that it only looked like some was missing. I can&#x27;t say this is always the case but it is my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** A note about this seller Wide World of Beauty: I bought a different eminence product from them and had a problem with the seal. They graciously refunded my money to me with ease. I&#x27;m very happy with this company selling Eminence products.</li>
    <li> Do not see any difference in my skin. will keep using and give it a chance</li>
    <li> I use this and other eminence products and I&#x27;m very pleased with them. I would recommend eminence highly hyper. I particularly like the facial products.</li>
    <li> Love this company &amp; this product! C.</li>
    <li> First time using a product like this and its so refreshing.  Face feels so fresh and clean.  Product is a must</li>
    <li> I love the Eminence line and to be able to pay less for it on Amaxon is also a plus</li>
    <li> Love it!  Nice little moisture boost,  easy to use and Eminence is a good name in facial products.  I first was introduced to this product at a spa where I had a facial.  Bought it for use at home.  Will continue to use especially during the warm summer months.</li>
    <li> This spray works well throughout the day when you need a little refreshing. I feel dewy and glowing; nice smell, too.</li>
    <li> I love these products.  My skin has shown vast improvement since using this product.  I have great confidence that I am not using harmful chemicals.  I try to use only organic products.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a short time, but when I apply it to my face and neck area, it feels refreshing and definitely firms the skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Love the Eminence line of products!</li>
    <li> Gentle, hydrating, wonderful facial spray. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love how refreshing this is.  I have been using this after cleansing for over a year and love it!</li>
    <li> I love eminence products.  I have been using them fot several years now and dont have anyyhing negative to say.  They are all great!</li>
    <li> This is a must-have product for mature skin as it works wonders with firming. The smell is somewhat &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; but after it dries you hardly notice it.  Also, it works well under BB creams and/or mineral foundation powders.  I have been using it every day and have received a few compliments regarding how &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; I look.  This is an Eminence product I will purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> I like this product, but find the smell quite different.</li>
    <li> Light, delightful, clearing. Clean product. Refreshing.</li>
    <li> An aesthetician used the Eminence products on me and I have gradually changed over to it. The mist smells better than anything I have ever smelled and here in CA I need hydration. I use before anything, then after, if I put on minerals.</li>
    <li> fast shipping great product!</li>
    <li> Use this one before bed with the rest of the regimen and you will wake  up looking younger.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of neroli and this is a product I use regularly.  The Eminence brand is a quality skincare line well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Products are great, even better that what i spect. they got on time, perfect conditions,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything for my skin to be honest, but I will purchase again simply because I love the smell!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Bought as a Christmas gift.  Recipient loves it!</li>
    <li> moisturizes, hydrates and refreshes the skin without residue. great alcohol free toner that feels good.</li>
    <li> Really adds moisture!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this product but ordered anyway based on reviews. Love it. Will remain a staple in my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I love this. My face feels fresh after spraying it on. It has never bothered my eyes. Some of the other reviewers said the smell bothered them but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I haven&#x27;t bought an Eminence product I didn&#x27;t love!</li>
    <li> So moisturizing...leaves your skin glowing. I love this toner. never leaves residue on your skin. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Eminence is one of my favorite skin care lines.  Neroli mist is Eminence line&#x27;s fairly new product and I started using it recently.  There are other neroli based procut lines (moisturizers) that can complement this product, but you can also mix and match it with other brands and prodcut lines.  Mist is hudrating and it has white color.  Scent is acquired taste since neroli oil comes from India.  Neroli is moisturizing and it is natural alternative for retinol.  It is perfect for aging skin.  I use it in combination with Eminence Acai&lt;br /&gt;Firming moisturizer in the evening and my skin loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff hear it keep your face hydrated and I use it all day long when I feel like my face is dry I spray this one it it is great</li>
    <li> I saw a difference in 3 days-I love this product!</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Very light.  Smells a little like fresh cut grass which is ok.</li>
    <li> Upon inital use I noticed a definite difference.  My skin appeared smoother and a bit taut.  I like this and I love the eminence line of skin care.  I can&#x27;t wait to observe how my skin responds to continued use.</li>
    <li> like it. smell good, feel good.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh scent and is refreshing especially in the summertime.  Use just prior to applying face cream makes for lighter moisturizing which is perfect during hot weather.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and love it.  It has turned out to be one of my favorite hydrating mist. I don&#x27;t think I will use others anymore, as I really love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Eminence is by far the best of the organic skin care products out there. They are carefully and wonderfully made.</li>
    <li> This product I have now used for about a  year. Sometimes my face is a bit dry in the morning and after a nice splash of water on my face and clairsonic... this goes on next. It firms the face a bit so that is nice. Recently I found some home remedies that are working well with apple vinegar. This product is nice as it is not tested on animals, and make in hungry and not in China.  The ingredients are rather interesting on the label.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product!! Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Excellent and my skin just soaks up  this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell and soothing to the skin.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I will order it again.</li>
