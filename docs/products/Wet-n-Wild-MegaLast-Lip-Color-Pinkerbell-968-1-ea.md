      <li>It&#x27;s a great pink color.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also very affordable too which is what I love.</li>
      <li>The color ws much brighter than the picture and it took me more than an hour to get all of it off.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more in the future :)</li>
      <li>Very Pretty color.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have is the packaging, but overall a great lipstick :)</li>
      <li>I love the product, thanks so much!</li>
      <li>color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily.</li>
      <li>Provider did arrive at the right time I promised.</li>
      <li>First off, the shipping was super fast!</li>
      <li>You really don&#x27;t expect much from THE cheap brand of cosmetics, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the price.</li>
      <li>this is truly a nice matte lipstick that stays dry and doesn&#x27;t bleed.</li>
      <li>Product was a decent price, came quickly and was packaged well.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more shades.</li>
      <li>kinda long lasting also, great buy</li>
      <li>I love the color, the texture, it last forever.</li>
      <li>I was scared to buy it at first because I thought it would make me look washed out</li>
      <li>Every lipstick I&#x27;ve tried in the WnW Mega Last line has had outstanding pigmentation and longevity, and this hard-to-find color is no exception.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love it, oh my goodness, a true pink color</li>
      <li>Very pigmented lipstick, stays on for a long time without really having to be touched up and arrived very fast!!!!</li>
      <li>Very bright, vibrant color I do like it, but it is a little on the dry side.</li>
      <li>Alot of pigment for such a cheap lipstick.</li>
      <li>but I enjoy it all the same.</li>
      <li>Obviously its cheap</li>
      <li>Love these as I have them in 3 other shades.</li>
      <li>A little bit dry, but the price is very cheap and a great product that is long lasting color.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I like these vibrant matte neon colors on me for this summer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice pink but definitely pigmented!</li>
      <li>highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This color is nice and is similar to the colors &amp;#34;think pink&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;don&#x27;t blink pink.&amp;#34; They all resemble each other on my medium skin tone which is tan.</li>
      <li>I put a little gloss on top.</li>
      <li>It is a little drying but all of the wet n wild lipsticks are like that which can be used with a light lipgloss over top.</li>
      <li>it cakes up and has that cracked look to it like chalk not as smooth as the other colors...</li>
      <li>I recommend using a clear lip liner to line/fill your outer lipline to prevent bleeding or feathering, particularly if you choose to add a gloss or balm over this lipstick.</li>
      <li>It is true to the picture and just is the prettiest pink!</li>
      <li>I even tried applying a clear lipgloss to spread it but still did not work.</li>
      <li>I just dab my lips with it to give a subtle stain/ hint of color and It looks natural and has a nice matte dry clean finish but doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips either.</li>
      <li>Pretty shade, like a neon pink.</li>
      <li>Fun for everyday use.</li>
      <li>So I usually have to put a clear lip balm on first before applying this lipstick.</li>
      <li>She wants other colours!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty colour but somehow after applying it looks almost like any other pink would on me.</li>

<li> , it&#x27;s long lasting, it looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> , fairly long lasting.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s stands out and is long lasting!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little bit drying, so I use Chapstick down first.</li>
<li> Reminded me of a little old lady.</li>
<li> last a very long time, as a single swipe provides lots of color.</li>

<li> Has a satin finish, not really matte.</li>
<li> i watched a few reviews on you tube of girls similar in color</li>
<li> But this color is a NEON PINK.</li>
<li> give this to my college aged, fairer skinned, cousin.</li>
<li> color is a pink with orange/neon undertones.</li>
<li> It is extremely MATTE.</li>
<li> Its a matte lipstick, so its slightly drying.</li>
<li> The cases are so cheap,and after first use lipstick gets all over the caps,it&#x27;s just messy and dirty looking.</li>
<li> The matte formula also is a little too drying for me, so I have to use lip balm before application, which mutes the colour quite a bit.</li>
<li> and it was still a waste of time and money.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This lipstick is horrible. It just clumped together into big lumps on my lips. It did not apply evenly in my lips and just looked horrible. I even tried applying a clear lipgloss to spread it but still did not work. Unfortunately, this colour did not suit me at all. But even if it did, the quality of the product is so bad, I would not have used it.</li>
    <li> Awesome products, got here fast!</li>
    <li> I threw it away. It was TERRIBLE! Reminded me of a little old lady. And since it was Lasting lipstick I couldn&#x27;t get it off (this is why it was given 2 stars instead of 1). So in that respect it DOES last.</li>
    <li> I really love it, oh my goodness, a true pink color and it lasts hours</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this color... looks amazing on tan skin!! The color is very similar to Mac&#x27;s vivia glam nikki minaj!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice pink but definitely pigmented! Comes off brighter than the actual color it is. Wasn&#x27;t expecting that but it&#x27;s workable.</li>
    <li> Everyone woman who loves make-up needs this color! Don&#x27;t be duped by MAC or anyone else into thinking they are the only thing out there!</li>
    <li> A little bit dry, but the price is very cheap and a great product that is long lasting color.&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick has an almost identical color and MAC Viva Glam Nicki.&lt;br /&gt;There is also inferior to substitute.</li>
    <li> Overall, great product. Awesome coverage, not drying, highly pigmented. But this color is a NEON PINK. Not quite what I was expecting. I&#x27;d probably get a different color next time.</li>
    <li> The lipstick arrived in perfect condition and it is exactly what I expected. I love the product, thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a lipstick fan, but I am absolutely obsessed with this color. It is so bright and fun. I was scared to buy it at first because I thought it would make me look washed out but it doesn&#x27;t do that at all. I would say that you need a lip balm or gloss to pair with it if you are not a fan of the matte finish.</li>
    <li> Great color and surprise surprise, fairly long lasting.  Why pay for a MAC lipstick when this is the perfect dupe?</li>
    <li> First off, the shipping was super fast! Now this color is amazing, very girly. Alot of pigment for such a cheap lipstick. Its a matte lipstick, so its slightly drying. The only problem I have is the packaging, but overall a great lipstick :)</li>
    <li> The matte finish is awesome and the color is exactly something I was looking for..  It is also available in kmart!!</li>

    <li> This is a really great color. It is true to the picture and just is the prettiest pink! Kinda bright and doesnt fade quickly . It&#x27;s easy to apply anf I get lots of compliments. I will definitely buy more shades.</li>
    <li> This is a very opaque, very bright and strong pink lip color.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a perfect dupe to MAC&#x27;s Viva Glam Nicki, only with a better price tag.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s long lasting, it looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented lipstick, stays on for a long time without really having to be touched up and arrived very fast!!!! Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The color ws much brighter than the picture and it took me more than an hour to get all of it off. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this color. I put a little gloss on top. Looks beautiful!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color.  It&#x27;s stands out and is long lasting! I will be ordering more in the future :)</li>
    <li> It is okay because I love the color and it looks good with my complexion. However, I did not know I would not like the matte finish. So, I apply lip balm before applying the lipstick and it works for me.</li>
    <li> I love it I usually add a little lip gloss to give me that shine but this is my favorite I even got my sister to purchase it!!!! Thumbs up for me</li>
    <li> Cute color good for it&#x27;s price</li>
    <li> You really don&#x27;t expect much from THE cheap brand of cosmetics, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the price. Every lipstick I&#x27;ve tried in the WnW Mega Last line has had outstanding pigmentation and longevity, and this hard-to-find color is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll last a very long time, as a single swipe provides lots of color. I recommend using a clear lip liner to line/fill your outer lipline to prevent bleeding or feathering, particularly if you choose to add a gloss or balm over this lipstick.</li>
    <li> Beautiful nikki lipstick mac clone. It is very creamy and looks perfect for the look I wanted. Provider did arrive at the right time I promised. Excellent!</li>
    <li> Very Pretty color. One thing to note, however, it DOES go on Matte. So, perhaps add a bit of chapstick or something before or after. It is extremely MATTE. I received a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> Product was a decent price, came quickly and was packaged well. I have no complaints about the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this color is a pink with orange/neon undertones. the picture is kinda accurate(unfortunately for me). Its too bright and not in a good way. i watched a few reviews on you tube of girls similar in color and it was still a waste of time and money. i am an african american, with medium brown skin, with yellow undertones and it looks ridiculous on me. In my quest for the perfect pink lipstick, im learning that for WOC, it will depend on skin tone, level of lip pigmentation and lip size. (not just skin color)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will give this to my college aged, fairer skinned, cousin. The search continues...</li>
    <li> Very bright, vibrant color I do like it, but it is a little on the dry side. So I usually have to put a clear lip balm on first before applying this lipstick.</li>
    <li> The product is of excellent quality, I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> I loved this lipstick it is a great color and is very comparable to the pink MAC lipstick nick minaj. It is a little drying but all of the wet n wild lipsticks are like that which can be used with a light lipgloss over top.</li>
    <li> this gets 2 stars! i hated the way this looks on me! it goes on horrible it cakes up and has that cracked look to it like chalk not as smooth as the other colors...</li>
    <li> Great pigment, goes on smooth (according to my wife!), stays on. Simply loves it! She wants other colours! Definitly sa great product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great pink color. You can make it a bright as you want. Or you can use it to make multi colors.</li>
    <li> Pretty shade, like a neon pink. Has a satin finish, not really matte. Love these as I have them in 3 other shades.</li>
    <li> this is truly a nice matte lipstick that stays dry and doesn&#x27;t bleed. it&#x27;s also very affordable too which is what I love. long lasting. I just dab my lips with it to give a subtle stain/ hint of color and It looks natural and has a nice matte dry clean finish but doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips either.</li>
    <li> I love the color, the texture, it last forever.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Nice Lipstick.</li>
    <li> color is vibrant and even though its a matte lipstick it glides on easily. kinda long lasting also, great buy</li>
    <li> Fun color! Obviously its cheap but I enjoy it all the same.</li>
    <li> I paid $2.29 at Wallgreens This color is nice and is similar to the colors &amp;#34;think pink&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;don&#x27;t blink pink.&amp;#34; They all resemble each other on my medium skin tone which is tan. I like these vibrant matte neon colors on me for this summer. Fun for everyday use. Great price and good quality for the price. The cases are so cheap,and after first use lipstick gets all over the caps,it&#x27;s just messy and dirty looking.</li>
