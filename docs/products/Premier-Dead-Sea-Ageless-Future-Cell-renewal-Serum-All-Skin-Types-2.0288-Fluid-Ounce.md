      <li>FANTASTIC product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>On days that I do not use it my eyes still look better than they used to.</li>
      <li>Also most cosmetic research agencies indicate that UREA can cause inflammation.</li>
      <li>Yes, I know most cosmetics use the synthetic form of UREA.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this product for all skin types.</li>
      <li>I was already using the facial cleanser and mask and this product was a great addition to these products.</li>
      <li>It leaves your face feeling so smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>This products has kept my skin wrinkle free on my face.</li>
      <li>This works great and sinks into the skin immediately.</li>
      <li>The best product that I ever used was Essence of Time [made from peat moss] but alas they have stopped marketing it.</li>
      <li>As a psoriasis sufferer, keeping my skin hydrated and silky smooth is a difficult task at best.   </li>
      <li>and I can honestly say that it performs the same as some creams that cost upward of $250 dollars.</li>
      <li>First I use the Obey Your Body</li>
      <li>This is light, non-greasy and makes your face feel soft.  </li>
      <li>I have used all the Ageless Future products for more than a year.</li>
      <li>I am use only product premier dead see for my skin, is working very good</li>
      <li>And fast delivery..I will come back more</li>
      <li>My husband also noticed the positive difference in my skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have found that this serum really potentiates the effects of the moisturizers either daytime or nighttime.  </li>
      <li>The mositurizing bars that come with the hydration creams really prepare the skin to accept the mositurizers.  </li>
      <li>It really diminishes the wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I will very  recommend for everybody.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel firm and gives it a nice glow</li>
      <li>Use is daily and I have already seen a significant improvement in my skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It is a little more fragranced than I like, but it is manageable.  </li>
      <li>I use this along with the Dead sea eye serum and love both of them.</li>
      <li>to go through with my normal regimen</li>
      <li>I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  </li>
      <li>find they help my 63 years old face look a little better, healthier,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>This product advertis it was brand new</li>
      <li>But you simply end up wasting more than half of the bottles content because the pump is really crappy.</li>
      <li>There is no way of knowing if it is really brand new and an original product, and not filled out.</li>
      <li>My skins feels velvety soft and it has reduced the appearance of lines around my eyes and the &amp;#34;waffle&amp;#34; looking area on my chin!  </li>
      <li>Skin feels soft and supple, but wrinkles have not gone!  </li>
      <li>Goes a long way and well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Liquid is really notbeven absorbing into your skin in my opinion i much rather purchase neurtagena or drug store brands not worth the money to me did not work well</li>
      <li>A little of this mighty serum works wonders.  </li>
      <li>So if you are sensitive you may want to try this at the mall without buying to find out if you will be sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ladies with mature skin, try them.  </li>
      <li>I am 79 years old, and everyone thinks I am in my early sixties.</li>
      <li>I applied to my face and immediately developed a burning sensation.  </li>
      <li>Worth every penny spent.  </li>
      <li>I find that this serum improves my skin quality if I have spent more time outside in our dry Colorado air.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I just love everything from Premier Dead Sea products.  I have side by side the ones I purchased from the mall and the ones I purchased from Amazon.  They are identical.  One difference is the ones from Amazon at 70-90% discount from the mall.  What not to love about the products.  Ladies with mature skin, try them.  Serum and cream work well together.  Your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> As a psoriasis sufferer, keeping my skin hydrated and silky smooth is a difficult task at best.   The best product that I ever used was Essence of Time [made from peat moss] but alas they have stopped marketing it. I tried this product for about a month and I give it 3 stars. It does hydrate the skin and so far I have not realized any bad side effects. If they ever put   Essence of Time back on the market I will be on it like white on rice!</li>
    <li> A little of this mighty serum works wonders.  I have found that this serum really potentiates the effects of the moisturizers either daytime or nighttime.  As with many skin care regimes there are advantages of using entire product lines to get the best results.  I don&#x27;t feel I have to use this daily, but every 2 or 3rd day is sufficient.  The mositurizing bars that come with the hydration creams really prepare the skin to accept the mositurizers.  I find that this serum improves my skin quality if I have spent more time outside in our dry Colorado air.  This is a definite \\&quot;must have\\&quot; when caring for one&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> , good product but nothing extraordinary I prefer Gratiae</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of Premier Serum.  It works wonders on my skin.  It closes pores and evens out tone. I think it has truly changed the texture of my face. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i love this serum. It is so lightweight. Makes my skin feel firm and gives it a nice glow</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin around the eyes, I barely have any wrinkles but the little bit I do have is reduced to almost nothing. Don&#x27;t wait until you have wrinkles, help prevent them from forming in the first place and this serum is wonderful. First I use the Obey Your Body Dead Sea Facial Peeling Gel to remove the dead skin cells and then the Ageless Future  Cell-Renewal, the absorption is immediate and within minutes the lines almost disappear. On days that I do not use it my eyes still look better than they used to.</li>
    <li> Bought this product previously from a rep at a trade show. The o ly thing I didn&#x27;t like was the price so I found it on your site and ordered it. Loved it  It did not appear to be tampered with</li>
    <li> the item was unusable I didn&#x27;t like at all.</li>
    <li> I applied to my face and immediately developed a burning sensation.  Felt like a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> I love it. It actually diminishes deep wrinkles! I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
    <li> This works great and sinks into the skin immediately. It is not greasy feeling, and it works well. I like the way it feels when I put it on my face. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice this to be outstanding - but don&#x27;t think it stinks either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am including these next few words becasue Amazon requires it. That needs to be changed.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the Dead sea eye serum and love both of them. Goes a long way and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It leaves your face feeling so smooth and moisturized. I was already using the facial cleanser and mask and this product was a great addition to these products.</li>
    <li> Feels like water, yet sticky.  Not at all what I had expected, so disappointed.  Do not expect to order it again :(</li>
    <li> This product advertis it was brand new and when I got it it was half empty.  I don&#x27;t use product that&#x27;s been used.  I don&#x27;t trust it cause I don&#x27;t know if something else was added to it.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This did nothing to improve my skin&#x27;s appearance. My skin was looking very good for my age, not it looks quite a bit older.</li>
    <li> I use several of the Deep Sea and Dead Sea products and&lt;br /&gt;I find they help my 63 years old face look a little better, healthier,&lt;br /&gt;and less wrinkled.</li>
    <li> Now, I have been using this product for around four weeks and I can honestly say that it performs the same as some creams that cost upward of $250 dollars. There is a small thing you have to remember when using this cream and that is that you have to keep using it to retain the results! I have been guilty of discontinuing use for a day or two because I was &amp;#34;just too tired&amp;#34; to go through with my normal regimen and I noticed the difference immediately. While using the Ageless future serum I noticed an immediate softening and fullness in the one present small lines I have on my 34 yr old face. My husband also noticed the positive difference in my skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that keeps me from writing a five star review is the fact that this product contains UREA! Yes, I know most cosmetics use the synthetic form of UREA. However that knowledge doesn&#x27;t keep me from being a little queasy that I&#x27;m putting the synthetic properties of urine on my face. Also most cosmetic research agencies indicate that UREA can cause inflammation. So if you are sensitive you may want to try this at the mall without buying to find out if you will be sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it and it makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  It is a little more fragranced than I like, but it is manageable.  It feels good putting it on, and it does improve the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> Liquid is really notbeven absorbing into your skin in my opinion i much rather purchase neurtagena or drug store brands not worth the money to me did not work well</li>
    <li> this product came with no box at all, and with no warranty seal. There is no way of knowing if it is really brand new and an original product, and not filled out.</li>
    <li> Another fake item or expired item. It semlled like chemical and for sure looks wrong. No way I put this to my face! Just burnt $650 to Amazon&#x27;s bad care, thanks!</li>
    <li> This is my 2 bottle of this, and it is so nice....I love it...Thank you so mutch...Recomend it...And fast delivery..I will come back more times.see you.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I will very  recommend for everybody. Fast delivery and very good price.I am use only product premier dead see for my skin, is working very good</li>
    <li> Use is daily and I have already seen a significant improvement in my skin. I strongly recommend this product for all skin types.</li>
    <li> I use this product after cleansing my face before bed.  It is WONDERFUL.  My skins feels velvety soft and it has reduced the appearance of lines around my eyes and the &amp;#34;waffle&amp;#34; looking area on my chin!  I recommend using it in conjunction with the eye serum and facial serum with vitamin E&amp;C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great products.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product, it&#x27;s garbage.  I bought the entire &amp;#34;package&amp;#34; which cost over $80 when Sam&#x27;s Club had this as a promotion.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Goes on smooth and feels so good on.  I use it on my neck and face everynight before bed.</li>
    <li> In the beggining it was fun to use this serum, and I thought it was a good product. But you simply end up wasting more than half of the bottles content because the pump is really crappy.</li>
    <li> I have used all the Ageless Future products for more than a year. I love them and my skin loves them. I am 79 years old, and everyone thinks I am in my early sixties. This products has kept my skin wrinkle free on my face. I only use it every other day, and use the night cream every night.</li>
    <li> This is light, non-greasy and makes your face feel soft.  My husband LOVES this after a shower and I use it in the mornings. It really diminishes the wrinkles. Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I have used this product in combination with the Premier Dead Sea Ageleess Future Cream.  I feel it tightens, smooths, and makes my face appear more youthful.</li>
    <li> Product shipped as described.  I used the entire bottle but never saw any changes. It does smell nice and is soothing on the skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing, I look good and feel great.  Worth every penny spent.  I was really impressed with this product.  I can definitely tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I love all premier prooducts.  I used to spend top dollar,but found them at an affordable price here on Amazon.  Try all the products of Premier....you will feel like your skin is 10 years younger.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels and looks!!</li>
    <li> Skin feels soft and supple, but wrinkles have not gone!  I will give it more time and probably order more products.</li>
