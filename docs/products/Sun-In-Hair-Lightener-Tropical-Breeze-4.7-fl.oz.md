      <li>The price is amazing too.</li>
      <li>I ordered this for my wife after a recommendations by a friend of her, people noticed the nice color</li>
      <li>Then between visits to my own stylist I decided I wanted to try it, to see if I could lighten just the top roots of my hair</li>
      <li>lovely scent, not too strong!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work better if I laid out in the sun instead of the blow-dryer.</li>
      <li>It says on the back that using this product if you have BROWN hair it may get an orange tint on your hair but now my hair is orange and it is not even good looking!!</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with my hair.</li>
      <li>I love Sun</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it for a couple more weeks, though.</li>
      <li>I was able to fix that, but what can&#x27;t fix is my now orange hair</li>
      <li>I was so pleased,</li>
      <li>My hair has an ashy undertone so the reddish blonde was perfect for me and gave my hair a warm, natural color.  </li>
      <li>and it came out fine.</li>
      <li>and it came out fine.</li>
      <li>She has light brown hair, and I suggested we get a bottle of this Sun</li>
      <li>She mentioned that everyone&#x27;s hair lightens differently with it, so I might have good results or I might still have reddish roots afterwards.</li>
      <li>She mentioned that everyone&#x27;s hair lightens differently with it, so I might have good results or I might still have reddish roots afterwards.</li>
      <li>I feel like this is my best hair product secret.</li>
      <li>This product works well with blondes, because you&#x27;ll get that golden, sunkissed, look.</li>
      <li>It lightens my hair so much!</li>
      <li>It worked really well.</li>
      <li>I had been looking at this product in every drug/grocery store for quite a while, and finally decided to see if it was available on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so gradual that people really think the sun did it.</li>
      <li>You do really have to use the sun rather than the blow dryer.</li>
      <li>My hair is much lighter than it used to be, and in a very natural way!</li>
      <li>My skin gets red for about ten minutes on the areas I spray, but I think it&#x27;s more because of the heat of the blow-dryer rather than the product itself.</li>
      <li>like that I can lighten it gradually, giving it a very natural look.</li>
      <li>but now I look like a natural ginger!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>and so far it works!</li>
      <li>I started spraying sun-in on just my roots to help blend the light with the dark....</li>
      <li>My hair is basically an off black and it lightened my hair significantly after two applications and a two hour sit in the sun.</li>
      <li>You will probably just end up having to get it fixed in the salon.</li>
      <li>It surprised everyone there but her.</li>
      <li>This product has Hydrogen Peroxide which will somewhat bleach your hair&#x27;s natural color and leave you with an orangey tint if you have brown hair.</li>
      <li>After years of damage I gave my hair a break from professional coloring.  </li>
      <li>It surprised everyone there but her.</li>
      <li>I have highlighted my hair professionally for 15 years.  </li>
      <li>It makes my Dirty blonde hair look gorgeous!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more subtle and what I used even when I was a kid in school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was fortunate and my dark hair does lighten to blonde with the lightener.</li>
      <li>I was fortunate and my dark hair does lighten to blonde with the lightener.</li>
      <li>my stylist noticed my roots didn&#x27;t look as dark as usual and said they actually looked really good.</li>
      <li>Every month I go in to have my roots touched up, since the very dark brown color of my roots it quite noticeable against the light blonde color of the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde</li>
      <li>But my hair looks like a natural blonde now!</li>
      <li>I bought this product hoping to bring out natural highlights in my dishwater blonde hair.  </li>
      <li>one point my 13 year old daughter mentioned she also wanted some blonde in her hair.</li>
      <li>It lightened my dark chocolate brown hair to a warmer redish brown which was more subtle against the blonde.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Sun In!!!!! (You can buy it for $2.99 at Safeway in the hair-dye section btw!!!!) It makes my Dirty blonde hair look gorgeous! It lightens my hair so much! All my friends noticed and thought I went to a salon they were all dieing to know my secret. After i told them they all started using it to and they love it! I bought the Tropical Breeze and it smells fantastic!!! and it conditions your hair a ton! It makes my hair so soft! I look amazing!!!!! I LOVE SUN IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time but when I went to put it on they cap broke. I was able to fix that, but what can&#x27;t fix is my now orange hair.... I&#x27;m a natural blonde and I just wanted it to get lighter for the summer but now I look like a natural ginger! It says on the back that using this product if you have BROWN hair it may get an orange tint on your hair but now my hair is orange and it is not even good looking!!</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this stuff. It just bleaches your hair and messes it all up. You will probably just end up having to get it fixed in the salon.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to bring out natural highlights in my dishwater blonde hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks and don&#x27;t notice a thing.  In addition to spraying it on, I spend the day in the sun.  I remember using this as a teen and achieving dramatic results.  I&#x27;m not sure if the formula changed, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any results.  I&#x27;ll keep using it for a couple more weeks, though.</li>
    <li> This product worked well on my dark hair. I definately saw a difference, I only put it on my ends to achieve an ombre look.</li>
    <li> My natural hair color is a very dark brown. Eight months or so ago I went to the salon to have my hair bleached to blonde, and I&#x27;ve kept it that way since then. Every month I go in to have my roots touched up, since the very dark brown color of my roots it quite noticeable against the light blonde color of the rest of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point my 13 year old daughter mentioned she also wanted some blonde in her hair. She has light brown hair, and I suggested we get a bottle of this Sun In instead. It&#x27;s more subtle and what I used even when I was a kid in school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used it some on her hair, and it lightened a bit. Then between visits to my own stylist I decided I wanted to try it, to see if I could lighten just the top roots of my hair some so the deep brown wouldn&#x27;t be as noticeable. It worked really well. It lightened my dark chocolate brown hair to a warmer redish brown which was more subtle against the blonde.  I was so pleased, I planned to use it each month between visits to help lightened my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That next visit to the salon my stylist noticed my roots didn&#x27;t look as dark as usual and said they actually looked really good. That&#x27;s when I mentioned the Sun In. She about dropped to the floor. She said she was so very glad I told her I had used Sun In on my hair. That if I had not told her, I likely would have come out of there that afternoon with half my hair melted off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She explained that there was something in Sun In that gets into the hair permanently. And that even 6 months after using it, if you put chemicals on your hair, they will react with what&#x27;s already been done to your hair and it will melt. She then went on to tell me about how years ago another woman had come in and done the same thing I did, but didn&#x27;t tell her ahead of time. And that she left with a very short haircut because her hair had literally melted off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few of the other stylists thought she may be over reacting, so she wanted to show them by doing a test strip on a tiny section of my hair. Using the same bleach she puts on my roots every month, she dabbed it into a small spot and left it on for only half the time. When she unwrapped the foil, that entire section of hair had melted. It surprised everyone there but her. She was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that instead she would need to use a chemical lightener, not a bleach. She did a test of that one and it came out fine. She mentioned that everyone&#x27;s hair lightens differently with it, so I might have good results or I might still have reddish roots afterwards. I was fortunate and my dark hair does lighten to blonde with the lightener. My stylist has been using that on my hair ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Sun In does work, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it if you are considering having your hair bleached or are thinking about using this to lighten your roots between bleachings.by doing a test strip on a tiny section of my hair.

    <li> Amazing! My hair is much lighter than it used to be, and in a very natural way! I only use it in the sun, because I didn&#x27;t got the same efect by using it only with the blowdryer. But my hair looks like a natural blonde now!</li>
    <li> I have not seen this product since the 80&#x27;s!  You do really have to use the sun rather than the blow dryer.</li>
    <li> works with or without the sun</li>
    <li> This product has Hydrogen Peroxide which will somewhat bleach your hair&#x27;s natural color and leave you with an orangey tint if you have brown hair. This product works well with blondes, because you&#x27;ll get that golden, sunkissed, look. Great for summer.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Smells like coconut. The price is amazing too. I feel like this is my best hair product secret. It&#x27;s so gradual that people really think the sun did it. I&#x27;m in love with my hair.</li>
    <li> I have highlighted my hair professionally for 15 years.  After years of damage I gave my hair a break from professional coloring.  Unfortunately that meant dark roots.  I started spraying sun-in on just my roots to help blend the light with the dark....it worked!  I live in Portland where there is little sunshine but the heat from the blowdryer was enough to activate the lightening effects.  The change in color wasn&#x27;t extreme, which is why it looks natural.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, my hair turned a reddish shade of blonde.  Some people may not like this, but I did.  My hair has an ashy undertone so the reddish blonde was perfect for me and gave my hair a warm, natural color.  I have used both the lemon and tropical breeze scented products and prefer the smell of tropical breeze.  I don&#x27;t think it smells like a chemical and I like the tropical scent (which I can no longer smell after drying my hair).  The only thing that keeps me from rating this a 5 is the nozzle.  When there wasn&#x27;t much left in the bottle, the nozzle stopped working and I would have to pour the liquid into my hands.  Given the desired effect and inexpensive cost, I recommend this product for someone looking for slight color lightening.  I have dark blonde hair, which seems to work well with this product but it may not work as well for those with dark hair.</li>
    <li> Great! lovely scent, not too strong! and gives a great blond effect on your hair!! and it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair dry!!!</li>
    <li> I use it to lighten body hair. I spray it on and then blow-dry to speed up the process. It takes a while still but I like the results. My skin gets red for about ten minutes on the areas I spray, but I think it&#x27;s more because of the heat of the blow-dryer rather than the product itself. I shower to rinse off the product and so far it works! I&#x27;m sure it would work better if I laid out in the sun instead of the blow-dryer. Anyway, great product! After I purchased it I saw it in my local grocery store for a few bucks cheaper. No biggie.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and I can already see a noticeable color change in my hair. My hair is basically an off black and it lightened my hair significantly after two applications and a two hour sit in the sun. My hair does NOT look orange, it looks slightly darker than a medium brown. Although there is hydrogen peroxide in it, my hair felt softer after I applied the product, even when I allowed for it to completely dry in my hair. I would definitely buy this product again if I wanted to lighten my hair again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife after a recommendations by a friend of her, people noticed the nice color and they thought she had changed the color of her hear.</li>
    <li> I had been looking at this product in every drug/grocery store for quite a while, and finally decided to see if it was available on Amazon.  Was very happy to find that it is!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now beautifully lightened as we head into summer.&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can lighten it gradually, giving it a very natural look.</li>
