      <li>I didn&#x27;t have much of my Phyo Gel left (purchased from Skinceuticals.com, pictured on Right), but I think you can tell the huge difference, not only in color but also viscosity (amazon product on Left)</li>
      <li>I was having some real problems with facial redness this summer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Skin looks amazing already after a month , dark spots are slowly vanishing from your skin.</li>
      <li>gel soothed the red within a week &amp; didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would buy again.</li>

<li> Takes the red cheeks look down a few notches...</li>
<li> I just received my item in the mail, and I can say with certainty that, although it may have a plastic seal around it, this is an altered (watered down) product.</li>
<li> Not happy..</li>
<li> Very disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money.</li>
<li> After nothing was clearing a two month crazy breakout on my neck and chin, Phyto saved the day, well my face and my sanity.</li>

    <li> This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s not greasey and absorbs immediately. It really evens out skin tone better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>

    <li> This is a great product for soothing your skin and decreasing any redness you may have due to skin issues.</li>
    <li> Thank you SkinCeuticals for making this. After nothing was clearing a two month crazy breakout on my neck and chin, Phyto saved the day, well my face and my sanity. I can hear the angels sing. So grateful. (This was in conjuntion with Clean Zyme and Skin Zyme. I&#x27;d say all three really worked well together).</li>

    <li> Amazing !!!! Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I love all of the SkinCeutical gels, but Phyto Corrective gel works wonderfully on red pigmented skin.  It&#x27;s soothing and healing for your skin!  Redness from blemishes will fade, your skin will glow and it&#x27;s very hydrating.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work one bit. Used it as directed for 6 months and no change in the sun spots on my face. Very disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money.</li>
    <li> This product, along with Skinceuticals B6  really help the surface of my acne-ridden face.  Skin Ceuitcal&#x27;s Phyto Corrective is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Not happy.. I just received my item in the mail, and I can say with certainty that, although it may have a plastic seal around it, this is an altered (watered down) product. I absolutely LOVE the phyto corrective gel, and have purchased it directly from SkinCeuticals many times with great results. I know they warn against buying products from Amazon and other online retailers, but as I am in medical school, I thought I would try to save a few dollars and give this a shot. Well, guess you get what you pay for!! I&#x27;d rather spend the extra $15 and know that I am getting the real product at full concentration--for 45$ it looks like I&#x27;m getting about 1/3 of the actual phyto gel, so not a savings at all. I didn&#x27;t have much of my Phyo Gel left (purchased from Skinceuticals.com, pictured on Right), but I think you can tell the huge difference, not only in color but also viscosity (amazon product on Left)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for years on my skin and this takes care of all my issues with breakouts to keeping my rosacea in check.</li>
    <li> Takes the red cheeks look down a few notches...</li>
