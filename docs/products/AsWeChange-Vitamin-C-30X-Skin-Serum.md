    <li> I rarely write review, but I had to take the time to write this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several skim products to reduce wrinkles and firm my skin.  This really works.  I&#x27;ve used it for four weeks and I can see a difference in my face.  The first change was a noticeably firmness to my skins and age spots fading.  It&#x27;s taken a little longer for wrinkles to soften, but I can see some progress of reduction of crows feet..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased Medpeel Vitamin C through a Groupon and am so glad that I did.  I will be ordering more (at full price since its no longer available through Groupon).  I will be a repeat customer.  Wish they had a daily facial lotion.</li>

    <li> Love it!  Excellent service</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month, per the instructions,  Absolutely nothing has happened.  It&#x27;s just like putting water on my face.
