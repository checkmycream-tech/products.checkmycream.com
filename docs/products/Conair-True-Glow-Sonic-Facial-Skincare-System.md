      <li>If it worked it&#x27;d be great...</li>
      <li>/&gt;While this is a great face cleaner, the difference is in the brushes.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it is rechargeable and can also go into the shower with you is great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy to use either one.</li>
      <li>This product is really amazing!</li>
      <li>OMG - my face looks amazing!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It also does a really nice job on the face!  </li>
      <li>I am happy to say that this device is just as good as the Clarisonic at a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>Loved it when it was working.  </li>
      <li>and I’m good to go.</li>
      <li>end results after cleansing are predictably good.</li>
      <li>and she loved it.  </li>
      <li>So I loved the product.. when it worked.</li>
      <li>I am blown away on how good this</li>

      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I love this brush!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You need to have a Clarisonic Aria, PLUS or PRO for 3 speeds; they&#x27;re much more than $99.99!</li>
      <li>Love this sonic brush!</li>
      <li>Amazing customer service.  </li>
      <li>daughter is especially happy with the Conair since exfoliating and caring for her combination skin has been a real chore for her.</li>
      <li>I have experience with this kind of item --</li>
      <li>This makes my face feel so great after every time I use it, and it really makes a visible difference too, my face looks so rejuvenated and great after.</li>
      <li>The ends of the bristles feel sharper and just all around not as nice.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m a tightwad,) but it required batteries, wasn&#x27;t for use in the shower, and was kind of abrasive on my skin.  </li>
      <li>cleaner, smoother skin using your own products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazing it removes make up perfectly and easy to clean up</li>
      <li>The charging system is not as nice.  </li>
      <li>You use your own cleanser to ensure gentleness and prevent skin irritation</li>
      <li>And it literally makes my face baby smooth, it&#x27;s amazing!  </li>
      <li>However, good functionality at a fair price is what is most important to me.</li>
      <li>Cleaning is very easy.  </li>
      <li>Wow, I&#x27;m impressed!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more of a wash and go kind of girl.</li>
      <li>An added bonus is that my Clarisonic Body Brush Extension Handle fits the Conair True Glow unit!!</li>
      <li>Its cheaper than the major competitors brand and delivers wonderful performance.</li>
      <li>Great at first but about 3 months in it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and functionality of the Conair is top notch and close to that of Clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Honestly, for the price, I didn&#x27;t want to love it -</li>
      <li>It worked better than I thought.  </li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I was especially interested in the reduction in the appearance of pores, as well as reduction of redness.  </li>
      <li>: Charging this has been interesting.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>it does give my skin a healthy glow.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I also love that it comes with two sets of the brushes</li>
      <li>My complexion has been clearing up and looking much better.</li>
      <li>They light up letting you know what speed you are on which is nice.</li>
      <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For the purpose of this review, my frame of reference is the Clarisonic Mia 2 system at a cost (when purchased) of about 50% more.  </li>
      <li>because I like it, but thought the construction could be better considering its listed price of $100.00.essentially identical results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My skin is glowing and looks healthy again.</li>
      <li>Note that the charging ports are at the bottom of the handle (which is the one thing I&#x27;d change if I could) - I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what led to its premature demise,</li>
      <li>I am now a believer - this is the best facial cleansing system I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>I really really love this product.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love that it&#x27;s waterproof</li>
      <li>I have purchased two more of these as gifts and those to are still working well.</li>
      <li>because I like it, but thought the construction could be better considering its listed price of $100.00.</li>
      <li>I liked the USB charger and the fact the unit was lighter than the Mia, an important factor when traveling.  </li>
      <li>That is much better than Clairsonic.  </li>
      <li>The charging stand can be considered a good feature unless you already have a bunch of devces that need to be plugged into an outlet in your bathroom, in which case an extra courd may not be all that welcome</li>
      <li>but it really improves skin, reduces breakouts, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
      <li>So I do use the medium speed on my face most often.</li>
      <li>fact that it is rechargeable and can be used in the shower required no effort for me to love</li>
      <li>AND I&#x27;M SO GLAD</li>
      <li>You will learn quickly and love it!</li>
      <li>What I have noticed is the red splotches I have on my cheeks have been greatly reduced, my skin is much more even in skin tone!  </li>
      <li>FIRST TIME EVER that I find a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; brush that is good as Clarisonic but</li>
      <li>So excited about it that I bought my daughter one too!</li>
      <li>This Amazon offering does both home and travel duty easily and compactly.n my face most often.</li>
      <li>There are many reviews here from long-time users of this sort of product, who are able to offer detailed comparisons.</li>
      <li>; Sure, you could, and that&#x27;s fine -</li>
      <li>The build quality is very good when compared to the Clarisonic and the design is very similar.  </li>
      <li>- a very good alternative to Clarisonic that performs equally well.  </li>
      <li>Still, this is a wonderful cleansing system and being able to use it in the shower makes it worth maintenance expenses such as brushes.</li>
      <li>Still, this is a wonderful cleansing system and being able to use it in the shower makes it worth maintenance expenses such as brushes.&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I notice my skin is pinker than when I just wash, and when I put on my moisturizer it seems to glide more smoothly.</li>
      <li>Because I&#x27;m taking more time with the brush, leaving it on my skin, rather than just doing a quick body scrub and rinse, I would want to use a soap with more moisture</li>
      <li>This Amazon offering does both home and travel duty easily and compactly.</li>
      <li>The product is easy to use and the brush head lasts awhile.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Charging also easy.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this sonic brush! It was recommended to me by several of my clients. I&#x27;m so glad i purchased it, my face feels so clean and soft after using it.</li>
    <li> Love this thing, your face feels incredibly smooth in a weeks time and break outs are now rare. It beeps every 10 seconds which I could live without cause I use it for 2 cycles morning and night but it really improves skin, reduces breakouts, it&#x27;s a great product and I am happy I found it.</li>
    <li> Every bit as good as the more expensive ones. Love it.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as described for about THREE months - then.... It will stop charging!  Dealing with Conair customer service is a nightmare!  It took four calls where I received four different responses (&amp;#34;take it back to where you bought it&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;oh- we would send you a new one right away if it were only two months&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;sorry- your warranty is expired&amp;#34; and finally send it to us with $3 and we will fix it and send it back&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;There is a major design flaw with this product---- the charging nodes are exposed -- bad for a product that is intended to live in the steamy bathroom. Bottom line- spend the money to get the real thing!</li>
    <li> OMG - my face looks amazing!  I was externally skeptical in purchasing this product or other products like this to use on my skin in fear that I may actually damage my skin.  For the most part I have great skin, except in winter.  It&#x27;s externally hard to keep my face feeling and looking healthy during the colder months and my skin just looks like hell (dry &amp; rough).  Well after using true glow, I think I have found my solution. It cleaned my face very well and seems to have evened out some rough spots too. My skin is glowing and looks healthy again.</li>
    <li> skin feels cleaner.  product works as described</li>
    <li> Would not turn on. Sent it back and got a full refund.</li>
    <li> I got a busted Skincare System. Luckily they are kind enough to fully return my money.</li>
    <li> Purchased after reviewing other types of facial skincare systems.  I have used a number of times and do like it.  I like the fact it times each position on face so you don&#x27;t overdue.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I think would be better is a small circlular brush.</li>
    <li> I bought my first Clarisonic, the original Mia, over two years ago and was instantly smitten.  It only has one speed, but that is all I really needed.  Last month I bought the Aria.  I liked the USB charger and the fact the unit was lighter than the Mia, an important factor when traveling.  This item is similar in size and shape to the Aria, but feels much cheaper (and it is). I like the stand, which the Aria has but not the Mia 1.  The charging system is not as nice.  The Mia only requires you to place the charger near the front and it magnetically attached.  The Aria uses the same system, but gives you the option of putting the magnetized area in a charging stand.  This just plugs in, which would be fine. However, I was concerned with the warning in the instructions not to unplug the unit from the wall without also unplugging it from the base as the unit will otherwise discharge.  My bathroom configuration makes it difficult to do so.  I could just keep it plugged in to the wall and put the brush down without using the stand, but the stand is what I like best in this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the much more expensive Aria this offers three speeds. I don&#x27;t really see any reason for this and always put them both on \\&quot;high\\&quot;. The Aria has me do this once and it remembers the setting.  This Conair requires I hit the button three times every time I use it (starts at \\&quot;low\\&quot;).  Quickly hitting the button once to turn it off works for the Clairsonics; this would only change speed.  It didn&#x27;t take long to remember to hold the power/speed button down longer to shut it off. Still, I find it a bit irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came with four brushes, two face-sized and two a bit larger and intended for body use.  That is much better than Clairsonic.  The units seem to do the same thing - move quickly and get all of the crap off your face.  However, I find these brushes much harsher than the Clairsonic&#x27;s.  The ends of the bristles feel sharper and just all around not as nice. The Conairprobably cleans just as well, but my face feels a little roughed-up afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the Clairsonic.  They are more expensive, although Clairsonic&#x27;s web site currently has their Mia 1 on sale for the same price as this Conair.  This Conair is still better than anything outside of Clairsonic that I have tried, but it really doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a dozen uses the brush doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp.  The speed stays set at your selection as long as you let it shut off automatically.  I still find the beeps (to tell you to move to another part of your face) irritating.  The Aria also beeps, but this is loud and sounds like a smoke alarm&#x27;s failing batteries.  I still much prefer my Clairsonics.</li>
    <li> I like the Conair brush.  It makes my skin feel cleaner and smoother.  The build quality is very nice; this brush feels solid.  The brush is waterproof and can be used in the shower, which is a great feature.  The charging stand can be considered a good feature unless you already have a bunch of devces that need to be plugged into an outlet in your bathroom, in which case an extra courd may not be all that welcome (the latter is my case).  The brush just vibrates, the disk does not turn at all, yet it seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I like the Conair brush, I still prefer my rotary Olay brush for the following reasons.  First, the rotary brush feels like it is scrubbing harder.  Second, the smaller pads of the Olay brush make it easier to use it on the upper lip under my nose and closer to the hair line.  Third, I like smaller footprint of the Olay brush and the fact it uses AA batteries.  I put rechargeable batteries in the Olay brush and I do not have to deal with that extra cord on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Comparable to the well known one out there but much cheaper!</li>
    <li> I love the Conair Facial Skincare System. I had the original one and used it for two years. It is very similar to this one except that it had only one speed and was a bit heavier. On the new one, I use the high speed and it is great for the skin. It stimulates the blood flow, exfoliates, and cleanses exceptionally well. I recommend it very highly.</li>
    <li> FIRST TIME EVER that I find a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; brush that is good as Clarisonic but less expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a skincare junky and have 2 Clarisonic for both of my homes.  I travel a lot for work and have been looking for something cheaper and smaller that will stay in my suitcase as a standard travel set.  I bought this a couple of months ago at a local Target, which had it for post-Christmas clearance at a ridiculously low price.  I am blown away on how good this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit has powerful and TRUE sonic oscillation, just like Clarisonic, and unlike other imitator brushes that just rotate.  It beeps through the different quadrants just like Clarisonic.  Even at its full retail cost, it&#x27;s way cheaper than the cheapest Clarisonic.  The only key difference is that the entire brushhead does the sonic oscillation, whereas Clarisonic moves the internal brush element and the outer element stays static.  That said, it performs just as well as Clarisonic at cleansing and exfoliation.  The gentle brush is also gentler than Clarisonic&#x27;s gentle brush...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - a very good alternative to Clarisonic that performs equally well.  Here are the details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses over Clarisonic:&lt;br /&gt;1) much cheaper;&lt;br /&gt;2) smaller and lighter weight;&lt;br /&gt;3) the button is bigger, not as stiff, and easier to push;&lt;br /&gt;4) gentle brush is softer than Clarisonic&#x27;s;&lt;br /&gt;5) construction feels very solid, seams and edges have tight tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equal/Neutral to Clarisonic:&lt;br /&gt;1) true sonic oscillation;&lt;br /&gt;2) truly comparable performance to Clarisonic;&lt;br /&gt;3) functionally equal in terms of on/off button, LEDs, beeps;&lt;br /&gt;4) variety of brushheads are available&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weakness and possible long term issues:&lt;br /&gt;1) charging stand is way too light and has tendency to tip over if the brush is inserted for charging;&lt;br /&gt;2) charging contacts are exposed stainless steel, whereas Clarisonic uses inductive charging with no metal contact exposed;&lt;br /&gt;3) charger doesn&#x27;t support Worldwide Voltages, so could be an issue if you travel overseas like me.&lt;br /&gt;4) only comes in pink and purple colors, looks too feminine for guys - wish they had a gender-neutral colorcharger doesn&#x27;t support Worldwide Voltages, so could be an issue if you travel overseas like me.&lt;br /&gt;4) only comes in pink and purple colors, looks too feminine for guys - wish they had a gender-neutral color</li>
    <li> Its a little larger than others I know of but maybe its because its also for your body too. For me I&#x27;ll be using it for my face. The cleaner has three speed settings Low, Med, High. They light up letting you know what speed you are on which is nice. I have a similar cleaner and its just a button from hi/lo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big thing about this cleaner is that its sonic, some may or may not know what that is. Basically, it vibrates super fast. Other makers have them spinning but this one does NOT spin. You have to move it in a circular motion to get that. The sonic vibrations are supposed to be how it cleans. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and while its nice, i&#x27;m not quite sold on it not spinning and just being sonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a similar product for about 2 years now and have seen a huge difference in my skin. But that one is smaller and spins with no sonic. The cleaner does come with 4 gentle brushes 2 for face and 2 for body. as well as the charging base and a pouch to keep everything in for travel. The brushes are very soft and work gently on your face. I use neutrogena and this cleaner helps massage the soap all over my face nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it in the shower and its brushes are easily swappable from face to body brush. For me i think its a bit expensive and there are other cheaper alternatives that might be better for some people. Overall its good but it didn&#x27;t blow me away. In my opinion i&#x27;d like to have the option to have it spin and also because i&#x27;m a guy, i don&#x27;t like pink and would like plain white or the option of blue. But in the privacy of my bathroom i&#x27;m the only one who knows its pink....lol</li>
    <li> The Conair skin care brush kit contains the brush itself, a power adapter, a charging base, two facial brushes, two body brushes, and a zippered case. All four brushes have convenient plastic caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Clarisonic, the Conair offers three settings instead of two; on the highest setting the Conair is slightly less powerful than the Clarisonic in my informal test. The biggest difference lies in the charging method; Clarisonic uses magnetic induction (like the Sonicare toothbrush), Conair simple electrical contacts, which is an issue. If like most people you keep the charging stand on a counter and drop the brush into it after use without meticulously drying it, the moisture will get into the contacts and they will rust quickly. This could also ruin the power adapter, so make sure you always dry the brush well before setting it on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The True Glow brush is a good &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; skin brush, a good, less expensive alternative to the Clarisonic Mia 2, just make sure you dry the brush thoroughly before recharging.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to buy the original clarisonic because I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much on some gadget that may not work. I saw the conair true glow when I was walking through target and decided to take my chances and get it. Best. Decision. Ever. I use it morning and night with the sensitive brush head and cetaphil, followed by Thayers witch hazel and Clinique moisturizing lotion plus. I&#x27;ve recently started to incorporate honey as a spot treatment because of the purging the brush does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even a week in and there&#x27;s  a significant difference in the appearance of my skin. Pores are already shrinking, blackheads disappearing. Scars are diminishing. I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long!  Aside from the purging that I&#x27;ve been assured is completely normal, my skin has never looked this good.</li>
    <li> I had been considering this type of product, looking initially at the Clarisonic. I knew little about this product but it was on clearance at a local store for 70% off after Christmas (they often order too many products for the holidays). The price tag made it impossible to pass up. I LOVE IT! I use it every night with a green tea scrub and my skin has never felt better. My dry patches are gone, I have very few breakouts, and my tone has evened out. I apply a light moisturizer before bed and I’m good to go. The product is easy to use and the brush head lasts awhile. I have been using it for 4 months and only have had to recharge the battery 3 times, including the initial charge. I never knew how unclean my face truly was until I started using the Conair True Glow system. This was an excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> So many silly reviews with garbage to say.  Let the unit charge 24 hours before first use.  Unplug the charger from the wall and you may store your brush at your sink in the charger stand.  It does not rust or ruin.  If you keep the unit in your shower, allow for it to completely drain without sitting around in water.  When the brushes seem to be slowing down, give the unit another 24 hour charge in a dry place.  I&#x27;ve had mine for several months without any complications, rust, electrocution, or need for plastic surgery.</li>
    <li> After a few months of use, the devise integrity started declining. Will contact manufacturer for an explanation, and possible exchange. It is a good cleansing system when working properly.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try a sonic facial cleansing system and this is a great one for &amp;#34;first-timers&amp;#34;.  I purchased mine from Bed, Bath and Beyond with a discount coupon so I paid $64.  I did not get the extra brushes and case but that was acceptable.  I agree with some of the other reviews about the timer; and I wish that it would provide a little more time between beeps.  I suppose that is to prevent consumers from &amp;#34;over scrubbing&amp;#34; and damaging our skin.  Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This product is really amazing! Makes my face feel and look clean right after using make-up.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from my $20 face scrubber ([[ASIN:B004V0SZNO BriteLeafs 4-in-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System (BL-802)]]) to the Conair system and can really tell a difference.  My last one had harsh, scratchy bristles, made my face red, and its speed was erratic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair brushes are really soft and don&#x27;t scratch or irritate my skin at all.  I used it on the medium setting.  At first, I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to do a good job because it felt so gentle, but after I rinsed the soap off, my skin felt really soft and smooth.  I really like how it has a timed 60-second wash.  It beeps every ten seconds, letting you know to move to the next section of your face.  There is a diagram illustrating which parts to focus on, though it&#x27;s kind of common sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m really liking it.  However, I read that exfoliating too much can be bad for your skin and make it thin, so make sure you don&#x27;t overdo it!  Also, don&#x27;t use this with an exfoliating scrub.  That would be way too harsh, and the instructions advise against it.</li>
    <li> I have a similar skin care product that uses replaceable batteries and a spinning brush system that I was quite pleased with. When I saw that the True Glow system is waterproof and can be used in the shower, I was very excited about trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included in the box is the device itself, 2 facial brushes and 2 body brushes with covers, a charging cradle with a/c adapter, a pink fabric storage case and a users manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I turned it on immediately to check it out and I was so disappointed to find that instead of spinning, the brush just vibrates. How can that clean my skin as well as spinning brushes do? However, I set up the charging cradle and set about charging the unit fully so I could begin using it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 speeds of vibration to choose from and Conair suggests starting with Low speed until your skin becomes used to it then gradually increasing the speed as needed/desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the vibrating brush actually DOES clean my face and body every bit as well as the spinning brushes did and it also exfoliates and minimizes pores and leaves my skin feeling unbelievably smooth and soft. I use the True Glow on my face and body in the shower every morning and then on my face every evening. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with skin irritation so far, although my skin is used to this kind of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair cautions you against applying any pressure while using the system. They have also incorporated a timer into the device to avoid over-scrubbing your thinner facial skin. It beeps every 10 seconds, prodding you to move to a different area of the face. After 6 beeps (60 seconds) the unit shuts off. This is the only thing I dislike about the product. I can see it might serve a purpose but because this system is also for use on your body, it&#x27;s very annoying having to turn it back on every 60 seconds. I wish that the timer could be turned off because that would make this system perfect, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the vibrating vs spinning brushes also make for less water splatter. This is great in the evening when I use it at my sink. I no longer have splashes all over the mirror and back splash! That may sound like a small thing but when you think about an item you&#x27;ll use daily, less mess and cleanup is a really good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are kind of expensive, IMO, since they are about $15/ea at this writing. I&#x27;ll be interested to see how long they last. Still, this is a wonderful cleansing system and being able to use it in the shower makes it worth maintenance expenses such as brushes.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the vibrating vs spinning brushes also make for less water splatter.

    <li> For the purpose of this review, my frame of reference is the Clarisonic Mia 2 system at a cost (when purchased) of about 50% more.  Of consideration is the lower cost on replacement brushes, which further brings down total cost of ownership without sacrificing functionality or effectiveness. However, Clarisonic units have dropped in price while replacement brushes remain around $25 a brush compared to $17 for the Conair brushes.  It is arguably difficult to compare pricing because of the many configurations these products come in (brushes, cleaners, pouches, cream, etc...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair arrived well packaged in packaging very similar to Amazon frustration free. The build quality is very good when compared to the Clarisonic and the design is very similar.  Conair includes 2 body brushes, 2 facial brushes, a standing charger base and adapter, user&#x27;s manual, and a decent storage/travel case.  Though my unit arrived charged, I always recommend you fully charge the unit prior to first use. Though I found the build quality to be very good, and the Conair is in fact waterproof for shower use, a concern I have is how the charging base was designed.  Instead of using magnetic induction charging like Clarisonic, Conair uses simple electrical contacts.  Since this product will likely spend nearly all its time in a humid bathroom, the contacts are likely to rust.  Therefore, you will need to ensure the Conair unit is dry before charging.  Another possible solution I am trying is to coat the contacts on the base with wd-40 as a preventative measure.  A little care will go a long way in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design and functionality of the Conair is top notch and close to that of Clarisonic.  Controls are easy to reach and intuitive.  The Conair uses high oscillation vibration for cleaning (like the Clarisonic) compared to less expensive systems (like Olay) that use a spinning brush system. The COnair operates at a reported 300 oscillations per second versus a reported 300+ per second &amp;#34;micro movements&amp;#34; of the Clarisonic (highest speed comparison).  However, Conair offers 3 choices of speed versus 2 on the Clarisonic.  Both units offer an audible beep to change quadrants (60 second run time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this system with the exception of the exposed metal contacts on the charging stand.  The sweet spot for the Conair is to come in priced below the Clarisonic to make sense to save the difference.  In a head to head competition with Clarisonic, in my opinion, the Clarisonic wins if they are evenly priced.300+ per second &amp;#34;micro movements&amp;#34; of the Clarisonic (highest speed comparison).

    <li> This Conair Facial System comes with an electrical charger, a charging stand, a carrying case, two facial brushes, two body brushes, and the hand unit.&lt;br /&gt;I received this yesterday and per the instructions charged it overnight. This morning it was fully charged and I used it as a facial scrubber and body scrubber. This unit is submersible and can be operated in three speed modes. Overall operation is very basic. You can apply soap, facial cleanser, or body cleanser to the brush and operate at whatever speed you feel comfortable with. Since I have used a facial scrubber for nearly four years, I operate at slow or medium speed. When not in use, the unit needs to be returned to the stand for charging.&lt;br /&gt;When I used this, I noticed that this did not feel any different than the cleanser I use every day. The manufacturer&#x27;s instructions are fairly basic and easy to follow regarding operation, cleaning the brushes after each use, and general maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;The end results after cleansing are predictably good. My skin felt smooth and soft. It did a good job of removing dry skin and other facial debris, and my winter dried body parts felt moister and devoid of dry skin build-up.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I thought this set compared favorably with my far more expensive Clarisonic Mia in most respects except that the body seemed to be made of a cheaper and more brittle plastic. I wasn&#x27;t going to test out the unit by dropping it on the hard marble floor, but this still seems fairly sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;This is what you can expect from using a facial brush on a regular basis. Under most circumstances your skin will be brighter, cleaner, and devoid of black heads and blemishes. Pores will not be clogged and your skin will look nicer. I usually apply an oil free moisturizer after cleansing before bedtime. I have used three different units at different times and intervals and the results have been uniformly good so I think the real issue here is cost and whether you want to spend more money for essentially identical results.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the Conair 4* because I like it, but thought the construction could be better considering its listed price of $100.00.essentially identical results.&lt;br /&gt;I gave the Conair 4* because I like it, but thought the construction could be better considering its listed price of $100.00.</li>
    <li> Actually I never used it, but my wife loves it and uses it every day, The brush heads fit on easily and it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clarisonic for a little over a year and I love it.  I have experience with this kind of item -- I was using the Buff Puff back in the 80s and then I&#x27;ve used almost every invention since then.  The only thing I&#x27;ve stuck with is the Clarisonic.  I can&#x27;t go a day without it and sometimes I use it twice a day.  For reference, my face is extremely oily and I&#x27;ve had acne since age 2. I got this item because I wanted to see if there was something out where the brushes were less expensive to replace.  This is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is a great face cleaner, the difference is in the brushes.  With the Clarisonic, I admit that I waited a very long time to purchase replacement brushes.  I didn&#x27;t notice the difference from a 9-month old brush and a new brush since the difference is gradual over time.  But when I broke down and got a new brush, I could feel the difference immediately.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that the bristles were like pins, but I could definitely feel the &amp;#34;sharpness&amp;#34; of the new brush and my face looked better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing -- the Conair brush bristles feel like the Clarisonic bristles after those 9 months.  It still did the job!!  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, but the bristles felt softer, they didn&#x27;t feel as penetrating.  After swabbing my face with toner there was nothing on the cotton, just like with the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for me, while this does do the job and clean your face, it&#x27;s just not the same as the Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Horrible product!!! Stopped charging just like the others have said. Was using it for about 3 weeks and it will not charge! I hate I wasted my money on this. I will not be getting anything from this conair again. Cheaply made with a high price. I will spend my money on something that works.</li>
    <li> The conair true glow came with the body of the unit, two face brushes, two body brushes (since replacements are a little spendy I was pleased with the two each), the pink carrying case, and the charger stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the submersible quality of the conair as I want to be able to take into the bath or shower. The brush does not spin, so if you&#x27;re thinking this is one of the spinning brush type cleaners don&#x27;t buy it. It sort of vibrates on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used my regular dove body soap and olay facial soap. Both worked fine. Because I&#x27;m taking more time with the brush, leaving it on my skin, rather than just doing a quick body scrub and rinse, I would want to use a soap with more moisture so it didn&#x27;t dry out while I was glowing myself up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush rinsed easily. I took off the brush to put the body back in the charger. The brushes have vented covers so you can rest them without them touching other surfaces, and they will dry without being gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I come out of the restroom I notice my skin is pinker than when I just wash, and when I put on my moisturizer it seems to glide more smoothly. I do feel this is getting rid of dead cells and leaving healthy skin behind while encouraging good blood flow to my face and body.</li>
    <li> The Conair True Glow Sonic Facial system has impressed me thus far.  My face and neck feel smooth and without makeup my skin looks cleaner.  I did not feel any irritation from the unit&#x27;s operation.&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t quite understand the concept of the brushes not moving and it sonic cleaning, it did deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no question; there are more expensive units out there and cheaper ones as well.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review should the &#x60;stars&#x27; change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. It is rechargeable and the charge seems to last.&lt;br /&gt;2. It has three speeds&lt;br /&gt;3. You can use it on face, neck, body&lt;br /&gt;4. You use your own cleanser to ensure gentleness and prevent skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;5. There is a beep timer which indicates when to move on to a different part of your face.&lt;br /&gt;6. Makeup goes on smoothly afterwards.</li>
    <li> There are many reviews here from long-time users of this sort of product, who are able to offer detailed comparisons. I&#x27;m not one of those people. I spend very little time on self-pampering. I&#x27;m more of a wash and go kind of girl. But I was curious and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the pads a little rough. I was expecting softer material. The machine is easy to use and the case is convenient for storage. it does give my skin a healthy glow. While I will use it on occasion, I&#x27;m still not good about any sort of routine.</li>
    <li> OLD REVIEW: I really really love this product. Since i started using it, my face has been incredibly smooth and clear. While it has not eliminated my blackheads around my chin and nose, it helps keep them as unnoticeable and clean as possible. I use it everyday in the shower for my face and it has an efficient timing feature. Every 15 seconds it pulses and it does this 3 times, to equal a total of 60 seconds. each 15 seconds is meant to do a quarter of your face. So 15 seconds on the right, 15 seconds on the forehead, 15 seconds for the left side, etc... after 60 seconds it shuts off. right from the get go i started using mine on high. my face is used to being exfoliated and washed pretty rough. For those new to aggressive facial cleansing(like with a washcloth) id start out on a lower level. This thing can get very intense and do damage. The 2nd or 3rd time i used it, i got a little crazy around my chin, and it actually took off a couple layers of skin and it burned for the rest of the day. So don&#x27;t do that....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i like what this product does. The fact that it is rechargeable and can also go into the shower with you is great. my ONLY gripe is that the replacement heads are somewhat expensive. $15 bucks at walmart, target AND amazon is a little more than i&#x27;d like to spend, especially when it recommends they are replaced every 3 months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 5/1/14: Charging this has been interesting. after i would let it charge overnight, it would act really really weird for a day or two. The first time, although it signaled on the charging dock that it was charging, indicated by a red light, it didn&#x27;t charge. it went dead before i could use it. the second time, it just wouldn&#x27;t charge. after a couple days of letting it rest, i tried it again and it charged. its been really choppy and unpredictable as far as that goes. for the price you pay, its a huge issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/13/14: it is completely dead and will not recharge at all. bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/31/14: Conair shipped me a replacement, which after a month broke again. I only use this in the shower, its not put under a lot of wear and tear, just me, once a day. i don&#x27;t understand why they keep breaking. This time the brush stopped vibrating and isn&#x27;t able to clean your face anymore. Hopefully conair will send another.....?lacement, which after a month broke again.

    <li> Depending on which retailer you opt to purchase this from you&#x27;ll have DIFFERENT items and maybe options for your set. Target offers a choice of a pink or lavendar hand unit. Thus far Amazon is the ONLY retailer offering the unit, charging cradle, 4 brushes and a travel pouch. Other vendors are offering the unit with charging cradle, only TWO brushes and NONE mention the pouch in online ads, including the Conair Store. Prices range from $80 - $120, lots of sales for the basic 2 brush sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORE Apples and Oranges ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic IS the leader in the sonic skincare market and IS aesthetically and visually more pleasing with more brush options (normal, sensitive, delicate, deep pore, acne, body) to meet your skincare needs, gentler beeping reminders to move to another facial quadrant and an overall more pleasant vibrating sound. The Conair sounds like it&#x27;s bordering on something in a garage workshop. That aside, it&#x27;s only a few minutes each day and it performs WELL; cleaner, smoother skin using your own products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to have a Clarisonic Aria, PLUS or PRO for 3 speeds; they&#x27;re much more than $99.99! Other Clarisonics have either ONE or TWO speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic replacement brushes range from $20-$25, Conair is offering theirs at $17.99&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic does have a body brush extension handle available for your back, Conair doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Authentic Clarisonics have a TWO year warranty. Yes there are fakes on the market which means you may not have a warranty at all! Conair offers only 1 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this test I didn&#x27;t use my Clarisonic for a week before trialing the Conair and it cleansed my skin (facial and body) as well as the Clarisonic and I&#x27;m happy to use either one. The normal Conair brush on high speed was harsh for my facial skin and I DO understand why 10 seconds per facial area is recommended. My face had a rosy glow from it, but it went away in minutes...thank goodness. So I do use the medium speed on my face most often. The body brush at that speed was fine and rough heels got a workout with 2 minutes each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s waterproof but with electrical contacts that can corrode is a drawback with the Conair and you MUST dry it off thoroughly before placing it in the charging cradle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the Conair is like a solid, well performing Toyota but the Clarisonic is like a Lexus, high performance and aesthetics rule. If you&#x27;re in the market for the Toyota, this Amazon offering IS AMAZING with the 4 brushes instead of the 2 brush offering at many other retailers because it gives you the MOST bang for the buck and I recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I have Clarisonics ...

    <li> Does a great job. Definitely start on low and work your way up.</li>
    <li> Broke within 3-months of using.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and charged as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Started beeping one day and would not stop for hours; it never worked after that.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the company and got no response.&lt;br /&gt;Product worked well, when it worked. I would not recommend, save your money.</li>
    <li> Loved it when it was working.  But device stopped charging after 2 months.  Read a review with a similar complaint, so not sure if this is a design flaw or if we received lemons.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic until it stopped working in early October. Bought it in late April.  Sacred to buy another, waiting to hear from Conair.</li>
    <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me say, I&#x27;ve never had something similar so I cannot compare, but I really do like this a lot more than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first concern would be that it would be hard to clean - I mean afterall, your skin has oils and crud on it, and secondly, you&#x27;re probably going to use this with product or to remove make up.  It&#x27;s not!  Cleaning is very easy.  You can wipe down the handle, but mostly you&#x27;ll just be cleaning brush heads which can be done easily.  They are removable and seem to clean up really well with just soap and water (I actually used hydrogen peroxide and a little dishsoap and ran it under a faucet while moving the bristles around with my fingers).  Seemed to work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does a really nice job on the face!  Bristles are soft, but take off makeup really well with a little make up remover and leave skin feeling very soft and non-irritated.  It even feels good...like a nice facial massage :)  Can even it it in close to my eyes because it is as gentle as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the bristles look okay (I&#x27;ve only used it 10-12 times though) and don&#x27;t seem to be fraying, though if you press hard either when using or cleaning the bristles do start to develop a splaying out so I do imagine that regaurdless of how clean you manage to clean it, you really will want to replace the heads after a while. Heads are meant to be replaceable though - it suggests every 90 days or so (after daily use I assume?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using is easy and pretty self-explanatory even without instructions.  You push the one button to turn it on and change the speed.  (Or hold it down to turn it off).  Brush heads pop on and off easily but seem to stay on just fine otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging also easy.  You plop it in the charger and plug the charger in to charge.

Connecting prongs are exposed though (it&#x27;s not inductive) so I&#x27;d think it&#x27;s probably best not to drop it in a sink full of water or use it in the shower/bath even if the internal ni-cad batteries probably not got enough voltage or short circuit current output to hurt you.

So essentially there is one replacement of each.  Unfortunately, the additional replacements are about 15 dollars (per brush, not per set!) each on Amazon as of writing this review.

    <li> I was happy with my purchase initially, but In less than a year the charger atop working. I am not sure why that would happen whenI use it only about 2-3 times a week.  Very Disappointed!</li>
    <li> If it worked it&#x27;d be great...but like other reviewers, mine stopped working/charging after 2 months.  I had it replaced with a new one and the second one did the same exact thing.  I give up, going to try Mia Clarisonic next.  While it worked, I loved it...but not worth $100 to end up in the trash after 2 months.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my stepdaughter for Christmas and she loved it.  After about 6 months it stopped charging so I called Conair customer service.  Told them when I purchased it and they sent a  new one right away at no charge.  Amazing customer service.  I think it was just a fluke that it stopped charging but they made it right with no questions asked.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush every morning in my shower for almost three years now . I purchased it because I was less then half the price of the clarisonic. I had the çlarisonic plus , it quit on me conveniently right after the warranty expired. So I purchased the conair for shower use thinking maybe the clarisonic shouldn&#x27;t be  used in the shower , even though it claims to be water resistant. Other reviews have said that it quit working after a short time of ownership. My has stopped a few times BECAUSE, if you look at the photo of the product you can see how it rests in the charger, on the front bottom of the brush handle there are two metal flat contacts that touch two contacts in the charging base. All 4 of those contacts have to be touching each other, so when you are finished using the brush clean the contacts , wiping clean from any cleansers you may have left on them from washing your face. Also making sure the contacts on the base charger is free from dust and debris , the base will beep letting you know if it lost charging mode , as well as light on the lower part of the handle. When properly charging the light will come on as well as a beep letting you know it made contact with the charging base. I have purchased two more of these as gifts and those to are still working well. The replacement heads from amazon are very reasonably priced.THANKS FOR READING, BYE.😄</li>
    <li> I have a face scrubber but not one of this quality. The Conair feels very sturdy, yet gentle enough for the face. The brushes work a bit differently because they don&#x27;t rotate, just vibrate. It does clean well. There&#x27;s a brush for body use, but I mainly use this as a facial brush as it&#x27;s not rough enough for body use. My main concern now is keeping the brushes clean and bacteria-free.</li>
    <li> Amazing it removes make up perfectly and easy to clean up</li>
    <li> I bought this unit over a year ago and got 3 months worth of use out of it.  The charger battery over a couple of weeks started to function for 25 seconds only.  I would recharge the unit, same thing.  Finally, it quit working period.  So I got 3 solid months of use then sporadic for one month then it was dead.  For $89, I expected more value.  I wrote to the Conair people about the issue but they never responded.  Poor customer care.  I will never buy a Conair product again.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I have only had it for a short time, but have already seen a difference in the wrinkles and texture of my skin.  I thought it had a spin brush and was disappointed when I found that it didn&#x27;t, but it does a pretty good job. I found a big difference when I quit expecting the makeup wipes to be the only cleansing that I needed. The Conair is really helping me with the extra care of my skin!</li>
    <li> It cleans the skin thoroughly.  Be careful on first use as you may not be aware how well it cleans.  You will learn quickly and love it!</li>
    <li> So I loved the product.. when it worked. BUT it stopped working after only 4 months of use!! It was never dropped or damaged in anyway, yet it won&#x27;t hold a charge any longer than 3 days and hardly turns on except occasionally after hitting the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button sometimes over 100 times! Doesn&#x27;t help the situation that there&#x27;s no warranty or replacement after 30 days.</li>
    <li> Wow, I&#x27;m impressed!  I bought this unit at Costco for $69, and it came with 4 brushes and a pink travel pouch.  I was especially interested in the reduction in the appearance of pores, as well as reduction of redness.  It worked better than I thought.  The pore affect didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations, but there is a noticeable (to me) reduction in size.  What I have noticed is the red splotches I have on my cheeks have been greatly reduced, my skin is much more even in skin tone!  And it literally makes my face baby smooth, it&#x27;s amazing!  So excited about it that I bought my daughter one too!</li>
    <li> My family has used a couple of different skincare systems and each have had some pretty bit limitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair True Glow is a very complete system that comes with a charging station, a carrying case for slipping into an overnight bag and collection of face and body brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is especially happy with the Conair since exfoliating and caring for her combination skin has been a real chore for her. It the short time we&#x27;ve owned it, she&#x27;s seen a marked improvement in her complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing we really love is that replacement brushes aren&#x27;t outrageously expensive. Some of the other brands charge quite a bit more for a set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that worries me a bit is durability of the contacts in the charging base. An induction system like Clairsonic uses is less likely to have problems with dirty contacts, and exposed contacts on the handheld unit can be an entry point for water, especially if you use it in the shower often. So far though, it&#x27;s been fine and we dry the unit before placing it back in its cradle</li>
    <li> What a rip-off.  Stopped working and it has only been a bit over a month.  Know wonder it was on sale!!!!</li>
    <li> Want your face to glow? Try this. Its cheaper than the major competitors brand and delivers wonderful performance. Just understand this unit is a bit different than some.. you have to move it around to get the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; effect if you want that but its simple and very very easy. It definitely outshines the cheaper versions that do rotate. I have seen a serious improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I must disclose that I have yet to try this product.  But I wanted to point out that you can get a Clarisonic for $99.  And the replacement brushes for this are about about $7 less than those for Clarisonic.  If Conair wants to really sell this thing to me, it has to be at least $40 less or else I could buy a Clarisonic Mia and perhaps take a chance on the generic Clarisonic brush heads that are around. I&#x27;ve been shopping around, and $99 is the going rate everywhere for the Conair.</li>
    <li> I have given this to my kid , it&#x27;s a toy brush , not what the add says like a toy that plays music . Bad company</li>
    <li> I had been using a regular, old-fashioned facial cleanser, the Conair Power Facial Cleanser which was super-cheap (I&#x27;m a tightwad,) but it required batteries, wasn&#x27;t for use in the shower, and was kind of abrasive on my skin.  I wanted to upgrade but, honestly, I was a more than a little leery about a hundred dollar facial cleanser.  Well, this system quickly proved my doubts wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw that the brush head didn&#x27;t spin, but just vibrated, I thought that it would never clean my skin - once again - wrong!  As I was using it I kept trying to convince myself that it wasn&#x27;t working, but my arguments faded into contentment.  Not only did it make my skin feel wonderfully clean without the abrasive effect of my last unit, it also provided a remarkable, gentle face massage.  When I was finished my face was totally relaxed and my skin glowed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is rechargeable and can be used in the shower required no effort for me to love - shouldn&#x27;t all facial cleansers be rechargeable and waterproof?  It just seems kind of dumb for a unit not to have these features, but so many of them don&#x27;t.  I also love that it comes with two sets of the brushes so I don&#x27;t have to worry about reordering them any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, for the price, I didn&#x27;t want to love it - I wanted to confirm my opinion that there is no need to spend this much on a facial brush system, but, kicking and screaming, it completely won me over.  I am now a believer - this is the best facial cleansing system I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m never going back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you&#x27;d also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it&#x27;s just to say, Hi!\\&quot;) feel free to post it below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Claire</li>
    <li> I had the clarisonic, and hated it.  This is basically the exact same thing, but for 1/2 the cost.  I actually like this one better because for the price it comes with a fair share of brush heads (body, sensitive face, regular face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in my shower, and use it about 2-3x a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I also keep a mini spray bottle of rubbing alcohol in the shower with it so I can sanitize the brush head before each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have only charged the battery one time - and I&#x27;ve used it probably 12-15x so far. Great battery life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a solid clarisonic alternative, this is it.</li>
    <li> This is a great skincare system for people who have never used anything similar. You will notice a result. Give it a couple of weeks, but it&#x27;ll get there. I&#x27;m not saying this is a miracle worker or anything, but it really does help. My skin(combination dry/oily) feels fresh and smooth after each use, and I don&#x27;t even use it that often, 2-3 times a week. I absolutely love that it&#x27;s waterproof and I constantly use it while in the shower (so much quicker and easier). It&#x27;s rechargeable which is another great feature and it comes with three types of brushes for the face and body. The actual device feels a tad on the cheap side and I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;ll be before I have to replace the brushes, hence the 4 star rating, but I&#x27;m very excited for this product. It&#x27;s not at all harsh on the skin, but I still feel nervous about using it daily, it just seems overkill. But I would certainly recommend this to anyone who wants more of a healthy glow and clean-feeling skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awful. I sent it back because I wanted a facial machine that the cleaning heads spun. This does not spin. It vibrates. I spent $40 and got exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for a month, then stopped charging.  It started beeping at 2am and wouldn&#x27;t stop.  So I threw it outside and at 7am, it was still beeping.  It stopped sometime during the day, but will not charge or turn back on.  Seems like plenty of others are having the same problem with it.</li>
    <li> Great at first but about 3 months in it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be 2 problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The contacts with the charging stand are, unlike my 5yo Braun, not very good.&lt;br /&gt;This can be addressed by wiping the contact points and/or wiggling the brush around while it&#x27;s in the stand.&lt;br /&gt;If your LED is red after sitting overnight..  it&#x27;s not charging...  give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The vibration movement seemed to diminish over a month or two.  By the end, even with a full charge (green LED) there was almost no vibration.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this can be corrected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking it apart:&lt;br /&gt;This will be ugly..&lt;br /&gt;The main housing is a clam shell that is simply glued or melted together.  The seam that runs all the way around is where it separates.  I cracked mine open with large pliers and worked around with screwdrivers.&lt;br /&gt;The back half separates cleanly, the mechanisms are connected to the front half.&lt;br /&gt;To remove the vibration component from the shell, FIRST pop out the circle in the middle of where the brush heads attach.  There is a small screw underneath holding the attachment point to the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest is straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;Remember, it&#x27;s very unlikely you&#x27;ll get it back together nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried cutting half of each support for the vibration platform.  This did not help at all.  I suspect something failed in the motor.&lt;br /&gt;Mine is now in the trash.</li>
    <li> I had the same experience shared by others here: after a few months, it began to beep endlessly and quit working.  Although I loved it until that point, I would not recommend it due to poor reliability.  Conair has some work to do to fix this problem before I would consider buying another.</li>
    <li> I Really like how this works with such ease and you can take it in the shower with you. My complexion has been clearing up and looking much better. I wouldn&#x27;t want to do without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Clarisonic for over three years. It was purchased at Sephora for around $250. The Clarisonic&#x27;s battery died and is not replaceable. I was frustrated to have spent so much on a product that is disposable. I decided to try this less expensive product, the Conair True Glow. I purchased it at Costco for around $69.  I am happy to say that this device is just as good as the Clarisonic at a fraction of the cost. I used the Clarisonic daily in the shower and the Conair has exceeded my expectations. I actually cannot tell the diference between the two units. Both work the same and both have the same results. An added bonus is that my Clarisonic Body Brush Extension Handle fits the Conair True Glow unit!! The only negative I have to say about the Conair True Glow is that it is not as pretty as the Clarisonic when it is sitting on my bathroom counter charging. It looks cheaper, less high-quality. However, good functionality at a fair price is what is most important to me. I will be purchasing the replacement heads here on Amazon, they&#x27;re the best price I can find. Would recommend the Conair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I am 39 with sensitive, combination skin and had cut back using an exfoliating scrub to once per week, because they seemed to tear up my skin and cause reactions.  My skin became dull looking, my pores were enlarged and I was always having small breakouts.  In just one week, of using this, my skin is so soft, clear, glowing and bright - with no irritation at all!  I have also been using the body brush attachment for my chest and upper arms and all those little rough, red bumps I&#x27;ve had for years are disappearing!  The Clarisonic equivalent of this is $199, so the Conair is a great deal comparatively speaking. Can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fairly well as a pore brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the included AC/DC charger only put out 4V instead of the labeled 6V.  This meant that the device did not charge and was useless after a few tries.  Conair did not reply to me when I sent them an email or left a message on their website.</li>
    <li> I owned a Clarisonic Mia and when it died just beyond the warranty period, I decided to upgrade to the Plus model mainly due to the body brush and attachment. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately in the long run?!) it was faulty; it didn&#x27;t charge properly out of the box, just continually vibrated for the entire recommended charge time. Back to Sephora it went. I decided rather than exchange it I would seek out something less pricey. I tried several of the knockoffs that have emerged in the past few years but nothing measured up, and back to the store they all went. Then one day I was in a Midwest grocer and happened upon this for about thirty bucks less than the current price so I grabbed it. AND I&#x27;M SO GLAD I DID!  Unlike all of the others, this one actually has the sonic technology rather than the essentially useless spinning brush head like the others. It is the same speed as the Clarisonic as well; 300 movements per second. Now I&#x27;ve read on beauty boards, &amp;#34;but I can use a 20% off coupon at Ulta and get a Mia for about the same price!&amp;#34; Sure, you could, and that&#x27;s fine - but with this you&#x27;re getting 4 brush heads (though you get no sample cleanser as you do with Clarisonic) AND it is a 3 speed model, so you really should be comparing it to the $180 model, the Plus. There is no attachment to use on your back as there is with the Clarisonic Plus, so you&#x27;ll have to figure out something else there. For me, with a little stretching, it&#x27;s no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetically, it&#x27;s a little less pretty than the Clarisonic (rating the Clarisonic at 5 stars, I&#x27;d give this somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars), but looks SO much better than any of the other knockoffs I&#x27;ve seen. It isn&#x27;t made of the cheap-looking shiny plastic that those are (on a side note, I saw the newest Clarisonic, the $265 Smart Profile, and they have changed from the matte material to a shiny one - and honestly this True Glow looks better!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after this glowing (har har) review, you may be wondering, why not 5 stars? Well, at just past 1 year (the length of the warranty) in, it died. :( Just wouldn&#x27;t charge. Literally one week past a year. Thankfully my credit card doubles manufacturer warranties, so I was abme to get a refund through them for what I paid. Even though I had to kick in another $20, I still bought another one. For the year that I owned the first one, I stored it in the shower. Note that the charging ports are at the bottom of the handle (which is the one thing I&#x27;d change if I could) - I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s what led to its premature demise, so this time around I only take it into the shower when I use it and remove it to dry when I&#x27;m done. If for some reason this one doesn&#x27;t last longer, I will update my review.</li>
    <li> This makes my face feel so great after every time I use it, and it really makes a visible difference too, my face looks so rejuvenated and great after.</li>
