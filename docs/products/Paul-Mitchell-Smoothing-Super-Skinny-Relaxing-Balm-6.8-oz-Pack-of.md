      <li>When you combine the two products, you get a nice layered control of frizz.</li>
      <li>As a bonus I&#x27;ve noticed my hubby likes to bury his nose in my hair smell it and tell me how good I smell a LOT more when I use this than when I don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>This product tames it quite nicely.</li>
      <li>So far, this is the best product I have ever used in my hair.  </li>
      <li>This stuff works, I work in a kitchen that is hot and steamy, and I perspire a great deal.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>Would recommend this....leaves hair shiny and more controllable.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product thinking that I was getting a better deal than the ones they sell in the salon</li>
      <li>the serum works so much better.  </li>
      <li>, I love it,</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>One of my favorite products I discovered when a hairstylist at a salon I went to used it :)  </li>
      <li>I had to put a serum on top of it.</li>
      <li>I had used a similiar product from this line for many years, but couldn&#x27;t find anymore...</li>
      <li>This balm is okay, I personally LOVE the serum.</li>
      <li>I love most Paul Mitchell hair products.</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous for doing that!</li>
      <li>I that one much better.</li>
      <li>For some reason this bottle is more watery and not as creamy as it should be.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great on days I don&#x27;t have time to do my hair, just keeps my intense frizz in check.</li>
      <li>The silkening mist is lighter, tames flyaways better and does not look greasy.</li>
      <li>i just got a very nice haircut and wanted something that will help maintain my hair without the need to put much heat.</li>
      <li>In fact, your hair will look stylish and smooth.</li>
      <li>And a vinegar rinse will easily get rid of any build up.</li>
      <li>works well on fine hair.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s fine by me, I like it.</li>
      <li>arrived quickly and intact!</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
      <li>But does help with it drying nice and straight.</li>
      <li>put a dime sized amount in your palms, rub your hands together and then lightly touch your hair from the ends up to the roots, running your fingers through the hair as we go.</li>
      <li>and this helps smooth them out</li>
      <li>I like my hair flat and this does great.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of texture and waves in my hair, and just a dab of this helps smooth it out and gives it incredible shine without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is fruity and pleasant but light enough not to clash with your cologne or perfume.</li>
      <li>She was right!</li>
      <li>Only after one use, this amazing balm significantly improved my hair texture and added a smoothing shine!</li>
      <li>Okay, so if you use too much your hair starts to feel crispy.</li>
      <li>The serum is better for people who have wavy to straight hair.</li>
      <li>i used two bottles over several times to give it a fair go</li>
      <li>This  is a great product if you have very curly coarse hair.   </li>
      <li>The Super Skinny Serum will coat your hair.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ll be back to get some more for sure.</li>
      <li>One added caution - The Super Skinny Serum will coat your hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered this by accident aiming for the super skinny serum.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Balm for years.  </li>
      <li>I blowdry my hair like normal and it looks better than when I used to blowdry and straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>The product is easy to use but very slippery.</li>
      <li>Definitely creates the most polished look!  </li>
      <li>i have fine, curly/wavy hair that gets very frizzy in humidity</li>
      <li>Worth every penny, will recommend to everyone.</li>
      <li>have curly/wavy, relatively healthy hair that I frequently dye/bleach.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised I don&#x27;t see it more often.</li>
      <li>I won a free sample bottle of this 5 years ago and ever since then, I cannot live without it!  </li>
      <li>When I&#x27;m able to cool off, I simply comb it out.</li>
      <li>I have pretty unruly curly hair but have straightened it ever since the first Chi hit the market!  </li>
      <li>Well, this Super Skinny Balm actually works better</li>
      <li>It just ends up looking natural and soft and curly and people compliment me more than ever!</li>
      <li>although to be honest my hair tends to get a lot of fly-aways when I use it on dry.</li>
      <li>Obviously it isn&#x27;t magic, but it&#x27;s not bad, my hair are squally pretty dry</li>
      <li>This is also a pretty good detangler -- if my hair is knotted after washing I can use this after a little towel drying.</li>
      <li>It even looks better throughout the day or the next day.</li>
      <li>AND it&#x27;s much cheaper!  </li>
      <li>I am on my 3rd or 4th bottle of this and still love it.</li>
      <li>This is okay but not the same and a bit slimier than I would like.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update in a couple months, but after only a couple weeks using this product I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>My hair definitely looks better now than it did 9 months ago when I started experimenting.</li>
      <li>Then lightly brush your hair and pat the top side from the part to the ends with what little remains on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, and since you only need a tiny amount, it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really effortless, and one other thing I love - it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky, which was a huge aversion when I realized I&#x27;d have to finger-comb the product, but it really makes a huge difference in the final outcome of both how the product is distributed and how my hair ends up</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This balm is okay, I personally LOVE the serum. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, as a product junkie, however I think I will stick to the serum from now on.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have a lot of hair and everytime I would blow dry my hair it would end up super frizzy and it looked just awful. I actually bought a different product at a salon and a little bottle of this came free with my purchase. The other product made my hair too oily but this one is just fantastic. My hair looks so great after I blowdry it now, I don&#x27;t even have to straighten it anymore. I use just 3 pumps for my whole head and I have no more frizz. I blowdry my hair like normal and it looks better than when I used to blowdry and straighten my hair. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It works well with my daily regimen.  My hair definitely looks better now than it did 9 months ago when I started experimenting.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, but this arrived today and 1/3 of the bottle had leaked. Really disappointing to open the box just to see my brand new hair products already open and partially gone :(</li>
    <li> Me encanta su olor a manzana reduce mucho el frizz vale la pena su compra pero yo lo estoy comprando generico por su bajo costo en sally.</li>
    <li> Love the product, but I&#x27;m not sure this specific one is real.  I&#x27;ve used this product a lot in the past, and it normally makes my hair super soft.  I&#x27;m not getting the same result with the product I received.    (Update)  I just realized I had been using the serum in the past, and this is the balm.  Trust me - the serum works so much better.  Get that instead.</li>
    <li> My Mom must&#x27;ve given me this stuff at some point, because I found it in my bathroom closet while digging in desperation one humid day, and I know I never bought it. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works! I buy it all the time now! I just finger-comb it through my hair while it&#x27;s damp, and it keeps my hair looking amazing all day, no frizz, but also not looking extra \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or wet, or any of the other weird things that curly hair products usually do to my hair. It just ends up looking natural and soft and curly and people compliment me more than ever! It&#x27;s really effortless, and one other thing I love - it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky, which was a huge aversion when I realized I&#x27;d have to finger-comb the product, but it really makes a huge difference in the final outcome of both how the product is distributed and how my hair ends up looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously feel like I finally hair the curly hair I was promised when I was born with it ;)</li>
    <li> A good hair product. The bottle I received from a seller had a spot where there had been a price sticker that was sticky and a bit grubby - so I am not sure what the deal with that was, but I love the hair stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to help curly hair lay correctly. It adds weight to help the hair lay down and be smoother.</li>
    <li> Bought wrong iteam, didn&#x27;t like the smell or Texture of this product. So I returned it and got the serum that I mean to buy. They shouldn&#x27;t make them look so much a like.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product so that I could keep my \\&quot;leave out\\&quot; straight without applying a relaxer. This product achieves this plus gives a salon finished appearance. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product. Have to thank my hair stylist for recommending.</li>
    <li> The product came within two days, and my hair looks so great, I love it, im using also the serum of this same line.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My hair is very curly.  but when it dries it gets frizzy.  This stuff TOTALLY eliminates the frizziees.  A lot of products say they do, but don&#x27;t.  This does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  This product costs $25, but I got it for $8.29. Talk about a HUGE savings.!  So I&#x27;ll be back to get some more for sure.</li>
    <li> Iv never seen any product change the texture of your hair then hold it in place.  This stuff works, I work in a kitchen that is hot and steamy, and I perspire a great deal.  When I&#x27;m able to cool off, I simply comb it out.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair care product because of a friennd&#x27;s advice. We both  have curly hair and she said this product would help tame my frizzy/curly hair. She was right! This  is a great product if you have very curly coarse hair.   I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I won a free sample bottle of this 5 years ago and ever since then, I cannot live without it!  Both my husband and I have long hair with mine nearly to my waist. Even though we don&#x27;t use heat to style our hair, the normal damage from brushing &amp; combing adds up. When you have long hair, even with proper brushes and combs, you tend to stretch the hair as you comb it out wet and further stretch when you brush during styling. The result is split ends, fragile hair and the need for frequent trims.  We have found that applying the Super Skinny Serum to towel dried hair and then letting it sit for 5 to 10 minutes makes comb-outs much easier and less damaging if you use a proper wide-tooth comb. You can also use on dry hair to eliminate frizzies on a humid day- put a dime sized amount in your palms, rub your hands together and then lightly touch your hair from the ends up to the roots, running your fingers through the hair as we go. Then lightly brush your hair and pat the top side from the part to the ends with what little remains on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way you can go wrong with this product is to over-apply it. A little goes a very long way when your hair is dry. When wet, you can get away with using more. The product is easy to use but very slippery. You will have to towel off your hands after using it or wash them. The fragrance is fruity and pleasant but light enough not to clash with your cologne or perfume. I prefer to use this on damp hair in place of a leave-in conditioner. Once hair is dry, I use [[ASIN:B000WMIOJK Kenra Platinum Silkening Mist 5.3 oz.]] instead of another round of of serum. The silkening mist is lighter, tames flyaways better and does not look greasy. If you have had problems with greasy hair using the Super-Skinny Serum, try using my method: Super-skinny serum on damp hair, Kenra Silkening mist on dry hair. When you combine the two products, you get a nice layered control of frizz. I then further treat my hair once a week or once every two weeks with a hot oil treatment. Using all three of these products together can go a long ways towards ridding you of split ends, frizzies and breakage. if you really still have problems with frizzies on your part line, use a tiny dab of hair wax or dread loc wax very lightly on your finger tips and then pat super gently in the sides of your part - that will lock down the short stick-ups without weighing down the rest of your hair. If you resort to layering on a humectant, you&#x27;ll have heavy, greasy hair. Carol&#x27;s Daughter makes some nice hair waxes for that purpose and no, you don&#x27;t have to be African-American to need hair wax on your parts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One added caution - The Super Skinny Serum will coat your hair. That&#x27;s how it makes comb-thru so much easier. If you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday or every other day, the build-up of product on your hair can start to look dull and greasy. If you only wash a couple or a few times a week, consider using a clarifying shampoo or one that is specifically forumalted to address styling product build-up on the hair. ANother added problem is that the serum seems attract dust and air pollution particles. My husband washes his hair every day but doesn&#x27;t shampoo but every other day. He likes to rinse out any of the dust that using a serum like this can attract. At least use a clarifying shampoo once a week to get rid of the excess product and you&#x27;ll be golden!s with a hot oil treatment.

    <li> Love it !!  It really helps my wavy hair get super straight, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of other products, and nothing works like this does.</li>
    <li> It does seem to bind the hair together so you don&#x27;t have that frizzy look but still a lot of volume.</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and intact! Was packaged apporpriatly in order to not spill the product all over the place! I live in a very humid climate and would not go with out this product. I have tried many other products to help my frizzy hair, and have not found anything else that compairs to Skinny Balm! I would recommend this product to everyone with hair!!</li>
    <li> Obviously it isn&#x27;t magic, but it&#x27;s not bad, my hair are squally pretty dry and this helps smooth them out</li>
    <li> Okay, so if you use too much your hair starts to feel crispy. But if you&#x27;re like me and have thick curly wavy hair that likes to give you the middle finger anytime you want to do something, then you might need to think of a regime.</li>
    <li> This is okay, I usually use the Skinny that is clear and is more of an oil.  I that one much better.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this product at all. Dries out my hair and makes it more frizzy, puffy and dull. Cannot list a single benefit. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> My mom does not go on the internet, so when she needs something she calls me. She been using this stuff for years and in the this small town we live in they just don&#x27;t stock everything, understandable.</li>
    <li> Before you buy this, take a look at your hair. If your hair is naturally sleek, shiny, healthy-looking, and moisturized, you don&#x27;t need this product. Nicer hair products tend to be tailored towards a specific hair type. If you buy a product not intended for your hair type, of course you&#x27;re not going to get the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly/wavy, relatively healthy hair that I frequently dye/bleach. I treat it regularly after each time, but my ends tend to dry out while my roots get greasy if I apply any product, making my hair look dirty and frizzy - yuck! My hair needed to be weighed down on the lower half and left alone up top. This product is fabulous for doing that! I don&#x27;t apply much, a squirt while it&#x27;s drying (I air dry and it does reduce dry time) and maybe another after it&#x27;s dry if the ends still look a bit messy. If I&#x27;m going curly for the day, I can use this product alone (as opposed to with mousse/a curl constructor) which is an added bonus. If I&#x27;m straightening it I&#x27;ll apply a heat protectant spray and my hair looks glossier and falls in a way that my hair NEVER has. It&#x27;s amazing! It looks shiny and natural. I do have to wash it out before using it again. If I apply it two days in a row without washing, it builds up and looks a bit greasy. If build up continues even after washing over time it may make my hair duller, but only time will tell. And a vinegar rinse will easily get rid of any build up. I&#x27;ll update in a couple months, but after only a couple weeks using this product I&#x27;m in love. I plan on purchasing the whole line.</li>
    <li> I ordered this by accident aiming for the super skinny serum. the balm is acceptable but it&#x27;s noticeably inferior to the serum in terms of detangling and defrizzing. Not worth the price, i&#x27;ll be sticking with the serum despite it&#x27;s horrific cost.</li>
    <li> I like my hair flat and this does great. Also when salt water fish or snow boarding I put this really thick in my hair then braid it tight. When I wash it out my hair is soft and pretty and not as horrible to brush. Kinda a deep conditioner treatment if you will.</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best product I have ever used in my hair.  Definitely creates the most polished look!  Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products I discovered when a hairstylist at a salon I went to used it :)  I&#x27;m surprised I don&#x27;t see it more often.</li>
    <li> Not so good for my type of hair. I have thick, wavy hair and it just made it blah.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing but when it shipped, it was leaking everywhere! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> good protection for hair</li>
    <li> Recommended by hair dresser for my type of hair. This product works great. I recommend it to everyone that. Reds extra I trol for their hair.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t review much but I feel obligated to review this product. I have a lot of (by a lot of I mean a lot, every hair stylist I&#x27;ve ever had has been telling me the same \\&quot;Wow, you have a lot of hair\\&quot;) very coarse and frizzy hair. For ages, I have been searching for the one product that can reduce my hair volume and make it less frizzy. And finally I found it! Only after one use, this amazing balm significantly improved my hair texture and added a smoothing shine! Worth every penny, will recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Only product I&#x27;ve used that controls the friz! I use it after every shower. I let my hair air dry a little and then use 2 pumps for each \\&quot;side\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It really helps your hair dry faster. You really do not need much. I found if too much was used it caused my hair to feel heavy.</li>
    <li> I started using this per my hairdresser&#x27;s recommendation. I have thick wavy frizzy hair..  It reduces drying time. minimizes frizziness and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky. Been using it for 3 years and hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> My hair is very curly. I hate frizzy hair. After conditioning my hair I apply a small amount  (pea sized) to my hair and it controlls my curls and makes them SOFT all day long. I hate stiff products but this one will not make your hair stiff at all...&lt;br /&gt;Normally I do not stay with products unless I really like them. I am on my 3rd or 4th bottle of this and still love it.</li>
    <li> Must have ordered wrong item. Wanted serum instead. This is okay but not the same and a bit slimier than I would like.</li>
    <li> i have fine, curly/wavy hair that gets very frizzy in humidity (i live in washington, dc..which is swamp-land, basically). based on a fair amounts of the reviews i read, i thought this product would be what i was looking for but no go. i thought i ordered one larger size bottle but i received 8 or 9 half or one ounce bottles. i used two bottles over several times to give it a fair go but it never worked for me. will likely just donate the remaining bottles. on to the next one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Balm for years.  Love it!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair caked with product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before. For some reason this bottle is more watery and not as creamy as it should be. My hair is not responding as well. Never ordered from this vender before</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong wrong with anything Paul Mitchell. My hair is course and wavy and frizzy and this product does the job</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and its frizzy i just got a very nice haircut and wanted something that will help maintain my hair without the need to put much heat. When I applied it wet and my hair dried it felt like I put in conditioner. My hair felt brittle and nasty. I had to put a serum on top of it. The directions say to use several pumps. I only used one for my medium long hair. I am disappointed of this product.  The serum is better for people who have wavy to straight hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Super Skinny Balm for several years now and I love it! I wait until my hair is mid-dry (I prefer to air-dry) then put this in. This is also a pretty good detangler -- if my hair is knotted after washing I can use this after a little towel drying. I&#x27;ve found that the trick is to no put too much in your hair -- when you do it tends to get a little sticky, and somewhat stiff (not crunchy, just stiff). If you put several layers on (apply, wait, apply, wait...) it WILL get some build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone with allergies, or anyone who doesn&#x27;t like \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; products, this balm isn&#x27;t overpowering, but the scent is definitely noticeable. Mid-range, maybe? Not super strong, but not super mild by any means. Also, the scent tends to linger...but that&#x27;s fine by me, I like it. As a bonus I&#x27;ve noticed my hubby likes to bury his nose in my hair smell it and tell me how good I smell a LOT more when I use this than when I don&#x27;t -- same thing for when I use it on dry hair, although to be honest my hair tends to get a lot of fly-aways when I use it on dry. But maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Leaves hair nice and shiny!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking that I was getting a better deal than the ones they sell in the salon.. Well you are, but the product it self isn&#x27;t as great as the one you buy in the salon.  Its water downed :( so you end up using twice as much product.</li>
    <li> Works as expected! Arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of texture and waves in my hair, and just a dab of this helps smooth it out and gives it incredible shine without weighing it down. It smells wonderful, and since you only need a tiny amount, it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love most Paul Mitchell hair products. I can use this balm on wet and dry hair, so it&#x27;s convenient. My Hispanic hair is wavy and difficult. This product tames it quite nicely. Amazon once again does a fair job with pricing.</li>
    <li> I have pretty unruly curly hair but have straightened it ever since the first Chi hit the market!  Waaaay back then, I got hooked on the Phytodéfrisant Botanical  (Phyto) Relaxing Balm.  I&#x27;ve tried nearly every product that&#x27;s out there but always went back to Phyto.  Well, this Super Skinny Balm actually works better AND it&#x27;s much cheaper!  It&#x27;s not sticky at all, nor does it weigh your hair down.  LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law is a manager at a Saks salon and recommended this product to me. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 years now. It&#x27;s great on days I don&#x27;t have time to do my hair, just keeps my intense frizz in check. However, it&#x27;s not sticky and does not dry or flake in an unnatural gel-like way. Very good product, although I&#x27;m thinking of trying out Frizz-Ease for a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have very thick frizzy hair and pairing this with the Awapuhi Ginger shampoo &amp; conditioner makes my hair super soft and manageable. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t incredible with regards to stopping my hair being affected by humidity. But does help with it drying nice and straight.</li>
    <li> This balm is one of the best. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or hard as a rock like gel does. In fact, your hair will look stylish and smooth. It leaves your hair with a wet look.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this....leaves hair shiny and more controllable.  Not too &amp;#34;weighty&amp;#34;....works well on fine hair.  Price of product is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product! I also loved the AMAZON price!  I had used a similiar product from this line for many years, but couldn&#x27;t find anymore... so I tried this from the Reviews I had read already from this site.  And I LOVE IT! It has made a huge change in my daily hair!  It doesn&#x27;t frizz like it used to and the texture even of my hair is sleaker! It even looks better throughout the day or the next day.</li>
