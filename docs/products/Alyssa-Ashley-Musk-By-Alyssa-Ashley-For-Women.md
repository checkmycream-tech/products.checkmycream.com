    <li> I love my lotion won&#x27;t use any thing else.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It has served me well,  Many friends comment on the pleasant scent. Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Sue Scott</li>
    <li> Great buy and great Seller! A+++++++ I love this stuff and would buy it again and again! ;))</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years and love what it does for my skin! The wonderful scent lasts all day. I can no longer buy it locally and am grateful I can buy it thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> THe product arrived on time however, the perfume smell associated with this product was non existent.</li>
    <li> I have been using Alyssa Ashley Hand &amp; Body Lotion for many years.  Suddenly I was unable to find it in the stores where I used to purchase it.  I went on line (Google) and found it for sale on Amazon at a very comperable price.  I frequently recieve compliments on its fragrance and like the way it moisturizes my skin.  I recieved it within a week of placing my order.  I will continue to order products from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Gave them to my aunt, bought 3 bottles of this stuff. She loves the light sweet musky scent and I love the price! Great value.</li>
    <li> Alyssa Ashley Musk By Alyssa Ashley For Women. Hand &amp; Body Lotion 25.5 Oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEADS UP ON THIS ONE, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS (PROBABLY 20 OR SO) &amp; HAVE GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF COMPLIMENTS ON THE FRAGRANCE OF THE LOTION. IT ALSO FEELS SO GOOD ON YOUR SKIN. IT MOISTURIZES, YET IT DOES NOT HAVE A HEAVY GREASY FEEL. I USE IT ON MY FACE BEFORE APPLYING MAKEUP &amp; AS A BODY LOTION DAILY.</li>
    <li> Great product. The only complaint is that the cap on one of the bottles was broken. Just replaced it with the lid from the old bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for so many years and it&#x27;s awesome! I used to buy it at Longs Drug Store &amp; they&#x27;re the only one who carries it but unfortunately the company was bought by CVS &amp; never carry this product. I tried to look for it at any retail stores &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it! So, I tried browsing in the internet &amp; found out that Amazon carried this product. I was so happy &amp; immediately bought two... thanks Amazon..you save my life! Really love this product, the mild scent &amp; great for your body...try it &amp; you&#x27;ll never be sorry :-)</li>
    <li> I always used this product since i was barely a teenager, and still at the age 40 I still love the unique soft musky smell. There is no other musk product that I prefer to buy but this one!!...Its the best!!</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this lotion for 20 years and got me addicted to it.  A little goes a long way, it smells GREAT and does a excellent job at moisturizing.  Musk fragrance is strong-- so you need to really like to be \\&quot;spicey\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I recently started trying different musk scents. Jovan, Skin, Egyptian Goddess, Body Shop, and now this. I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon and makeupalley. This experience reinforces the old saying: To each his/her own. This one did NOT work/do it for me. My husband and son thought it cheap and overpoweringly powdery-old-lady smelling, and I agree. Egyptian Goddess much more subtle and sophisticated-and so far my favorite of all of the above.</li>
    <li> I really love this scent. It does not seem to be quite the same as it use to be, not as strong. The value is good but the bottle is large and difficult for small hands to hold on to. I wish it had a pump top. I am actually looking for one to substitute.</li>
    <li> II ordered this lotion for my sweety,It is a very good staff I encourage you to do the same,she will love it...</li>
    <li> I liked the old scent better.  Overall I think this one is ok., but it does not come close&lt;br /&gt;to the fragrance from the old one.  I wish they make the old body lotion scent.</li>
    <li> This lotion is one of my favorites. The scent is light but intoxicating. And the price is great.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the great price for the Alyssa Ashley body lotion.  It is my favorite lotion and I was able to by two bottles for less than the price of one.  I was so amazed that I will always check Amazon for other items in the future.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This lotion just doesn&#x27;t smell like the same perfume by this name that came out years ago. I will probably end up giving it away to someone else.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for many years and I love it! I always get compliments and people ask me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. Not overpowering, just a very nice lotion.</li>
    <li> A gift for my mother (along with the powder).  She absolutely loves both.  The bottle is HUGE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Alyssa Ashley Musk Hand &amp; Body Lotion for years and have always gotten compliments on how good I smell.  It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and the fragrance is wonderful.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering but anyone who comes face to face always says, \\&quot;Gee, you smell so good!!\\&quot;  I have allergies and lots of scents leave me sneezing or make head close up.  Not Alyssa Ashley Musk!  When I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores a few years ago, I was frantic.  I finally found it on the internet and now I found it on Amazon.  Hooray!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you like a subtle musk scent.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this lotion for a christmas gift. When I opened it to smell it, it had no cologne scent at all. Just smelled like plain lotion. Must have been old. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> The items arrived very quickly and packaged very well.  This is a favorite lotion and hard to find.  I&#x27;m so happy that I found this and was able to buy 4 bottles.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> Love this and buy this often. However they&#x27;ve changed the bottle. This bottle is extremely hard plastic, I have a hard time squeezing the bottle. I have to remove the cap because I can&#x27;t squeeze the bottle. Somebody with arthritis or not enough strength will have an issue with this bottle. Bring back the thinner plastic please!</li>
    <li> I, too, have been using this lotion for over twenty years.  I, too, have been having a very hard time finding it.  I&#x27;m glad to know Amazon.com is now carrying it.  I think the title for the lotion is incorrect, however.  The emblems on the bottle are both male and female and I, who have been using the lotion for years, am a male.  I get lots of compliments on the smell and I, too, like the way it makes my skin feel.  Are you sure it&#x27;s just for women?</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> order this few times already loved this lotion!</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and it smells awsome</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion when i was in the Philippines.  When i was in Phoenix, i was looking at the mall but i haven&#x27;t seen any.  Thanks there&#x27;s Amazon where i can order it.  I love the frangrance of this lotion.  Try it, you will love it too.</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law asked me to purchase this item for her.  She likes this item and uses it reguarly. That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I love it . Oh it makes me smell WONDERFUL!!!</li>
    <li> I love that product and haven&#x27;t been able to find it for years. That has always been my scent. Thank you so much and now I know where to get it</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mother as this was her scent when I was a little girl.  Gave only 4 stars because scent was not lasting as it was long ago.</li>
    <li> I do love the fragrance and smoothness of the lotion. The bottle should be a little softer so it&#x27;s easier to squeeze</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It has a soft and very sensual aroma. The bottle is huge and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite musk scents.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK...not much scent to it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  It has a nice clean scent - and does not smell &amp;#34;too perfumy&amp;#34;.  It is the only lotion/perfume I wear!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for so many years I cannot remember when I first bought it. I get frequent compliments on its&#x27; light, non-offensive scent, even in closed elevators. It has kept my skin soft; and now, at 78, less dry and wrinkled than many of my contemporaries. I highly recommend it and, am so pleased to have found I can buy it online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and plan on continuing to do so.</li>
    <li> I like the smell but its so hard to squeze the bottle so i had to buy a different bottle  so it would be easy to dispence the lotion</li>
    <li> I ordered this Musk Body Lotion as a Xmas present for my wife. She loves it!!!! Great price for a 25.5 oz. bottle.</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff. Think that the aroma is wonderful. Have not had any of this Alyssa Ashley musk lotion in a very long time. So glad that I came back to it. Softens the hands, nicely. A little pricey , but heck, I&#x27;m worth it. If the scent has changed from years ago I am not aware of it because like I have said it&#x27;s been a long time. I enjoy the scent and love the way it softens my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. My best review for this product is that if it where to be dis-continued it would be a great&lt;br /&gt;loss. I have had a hard time finding it locally. However, I did find it online at another retailer, and then (thank goodness) discovered it on Amazon, and I am so glad I did.  Shipping was faster, better price.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot praise this product enough. Once you use it you will never change. Nice pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> My husband tells me that my skin feels like a flower petal, its so soft.  My granddaughter tells me I have the sofest hands.  I neve feel itcy when I use my body lotion, just love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this excellent fragrance for years. Although advertised &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34; I rather go for the lunisex label logo. Was delivered very fast and exactly the product I wanted. Would RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> Have used Alyssa Ashley products for years.wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my sister she loves this stuff! It shipped quickly and she is in an remote area will ord again for her.</li>
    <li> The musk is subtle yet has staying power.  I would give five starts except the moisturizer aspect of it doesn&#x27;t seem quality.  Too much astringent or something.  However, this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased (discovered it in Canada) and when it runs out will get another.</li>
    <li> I have used Alyssa Ashley for years and when I was told here in San Angelo, Texas that it had been discontinued, I panicked. For me you cannot find a better smelling, better feeling lotion. I searched for a few months before I found how I could get some more and I &amp;#34;Thank You Amazon&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This body lotion has such a light clean scent.  I have been wearing it so long that I don&#x27;t even notice, BUT everyone will comment what a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;I NEVER wear any perfume,  I just hope it will always be available.  I have been using this product for at least 15 years.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 20 years and it still smells great. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I would recommend to every Baby Boom Woman, it&#x27;s us. it is the 50&#x27;s 60&#x27;s, clean smell. Not flowery or overwhelming, just right.</li>
    <li> Love my Alyssa Ashley Musk lotion!  FAST shipping! Thanks so much until next time!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, a traditional musk fragrance.  Lotion is average, but I purchased for the fragrance, as I am allergic to all perfumes.  This does not bother me.</li>
    <li> Use this every day and absolutely love it.  It is a wonderful scent, easy on the nose.  Get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I always buy !</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It brings me back to the 90s.  The nice smell of musk.  And the price is great!!!!!!!!! Stock up!</li>
    <li> Smells simple and wonderful.  It&#x27;s not empowering like some other musk scents that makes me have a headache.  Will always love this one of a kind lotion.</li>
    <li> Really like the scent, smooths on the skin very nicely.  Will buy this product again and have recommended to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> So love my musk lotion</li>
    <li> I love this hand and body lotion.  I use it daily along with the musk oil.</li>
    <li> Seem to remember the scent of this lotion as being a bit more lasting. However I love the velvety, soft smell plus the lotion feels very nourishing and soothing on skin. Totally fresh also and doesn&#x27;t have any stickiness.</li>
    <li> I have been using it since 1972.  To be honest with you , at the age of 70 years old everybody compliments my skin as the skin of 50 years old woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it when it was available at Carson Pirie, then Carson Pirie stopped selling it.  Then I found it in Sears and then then found it in the website.  I usually buy 6 bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like I remembered it from years ago.</li>
    <li> I already knew the product, purchased on a trip to Italy. It is very good indeed. Would buy again, and without hesitating.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom.  She has been using this product ever since I can remember; I mean decades!  We can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so when we come across it online we stock up.  Such a soft, feminine scent perfect for anytime of the year.  She slathers it on after every shower and always smells great!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful too. The finishing touch after the shower and it is all that you would need. I love this collection</li>
    <li> My moms is loving this.</li>
    <li> If you used it in the 80&#x27;s .....You love it even  more in 2014. Bought it for all my friends and it took them back in time.</li>
    <li> expected delivery. smells nice. wife loves it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of all time!  Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> the scent isn&#x27;t as long lasting as it used to be , but glad Amazon carries it</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a fast absorbing cream which leaves your skin feeling smooth and non sticky this is the cream for you. It smell is pleasant and in no way overpowering.</li>
    <li> great for the skin and smells good</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion. I used it when I was in college many moons ago, I could not aford parfum at the time. I love this fragrance and I get so many compliments. I could not find it for years, until I found Amazon. The fragrance is light however, the suttleness of it last all day and it keeps my skin soft. I have some in a small bottle I carry in my bag to lotion my hands after washing them. I love the smell it is so fresh and not over powering. If you are considering buying do so. I am in my 60s and I still rememberd how wonderful the fragrance was that is why I had to find it. I believe I will stock up it took me too long to find it again.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this product for quite a while and could not find it locally. She was glad to see that you had some in stock. She would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this. She has been using it for decades and is constantly asked of her &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s just this cream.</li>
    <li> arrived timely, smells wonderful</li>
    <li> got for a friend and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I just love, love, love this product! Whenever  i wear this, I get nothing but compliments!</li>
    <li> I love The Alyssa Ashley Musk Lotion,the nice fresh sent. I have had it before . I only have one problem with it I&#x27;m older now and the container it comes in, the plastic is so thick I can&#x27;t squeeze the bottle. I don&#x27;t have the strength in my hands anymore. But I turn it upside down and let it run out.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s scent is different from the one im expecting. im thinking this is made in china perhaps.</li>
    <li> This product is not named properly: it is not just for women. My husband uses it on his face after shaving. The product moisturizes his face nicely and the scent is not &amp;#34;feminine.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s just a fresh clean musky scent.</li>
    <li> Clean and fresh smell for everyday use. Good for both males and females.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as they make it!  Fresh, clean scent.  Not overwhelming.  Very sexy!</li>
    <li> I have been waering this lotion since 1972, it&#x27;s the only thing that I can wear. I love this lotion. PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Had never had lotion and when I saw it I was so excited.  Bought it and I absolutely love it and love the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for over twenty years and still continue to get compliments on the subtle lovely fragrance.  The lotion keeps my skin soft while the fragrance lifts my spirits and makes me feel so feminine. I love this product; there is nothing like it!  Over the years, this lotion has become so hard to find and whenever there was a special promotion, I would stock up.  Now I can just order from Amazon.com whenever I run low... Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; loves this stuff</li>
    <li> I used to use this product years ago and thought it was obsolete.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to get it again through Amazon.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for over 20 years.  It goes right into your skin and smells wonderful.  I even got one for my friend</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years and have never been disappointed.  It makes my skin feel smooth and silky without being greasy.  I am often told &amp;#34;You smell so good&amp;#34;, by both men and women, and I attribute those comments to this product as I don&#x27;t wear perfume.  My sister became a fan shortly after I did and I have often referred this product to other women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for continuing to make Alyssa Ashley Musk!</li>
    <li> I thought this product was on the high scalelike ashley Stewart musk lotion but,this lotion hardly has any odor,its just a plain bottle of lotion,I&#x27;m very very disappointed,but I can&#x27;t afford to send it back,this was money wasted,and I&#x27;m on a dixed income!!!</li>
    <li> This purchase arrived exactly as I requested! I am very happy with the service.  I will buy again as needed.</li>
    <li> Hard to find at the store.  Great deal for the amount of lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this fragrance. I wore it many years ago and had thought they didn&#x27;t make it anymore. Love it as much today as I did back then.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE lotion.  Please never discontinue this. I will always buy it!!!  Your site is so very easy, convenient and costly to use.</li>
    <li> The lotion does not have any fragrance compared to the original AA lotion I used to purchased at Amazon. I hope the seller will stop this kind of activity. I will contact the AA company and probably will send a bottle of what purchased</li>
    <li> hello thank you for the fast shipping ,i am glad that i found this stuff to the amazon, i have been used for a long years when i was in the Philippines..thank you and more power</li>
    <li> I love this product and have received compliments about how good I smell.  Thisis the only thing I have used for years.  I have multiple allergies and this is a product that I can tolerate with ease.  Great lotion and outstanding price.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion ever!!</li>
    <li> smells so soft and clean</li>
    <li> My favorite scent. I&#x27;ve been buying it for my wife for over 25 years. She loves it too!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion exclusively for as long as I can remember and it never fails to get at least one compliment for its fragrance.  Will continue to use it as slong as  I can find it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alyssa Ashley lotion since I was in High school... I&#x27;ve always loved the smell.  I found it here but it was quite a disappointment as many sellers were selling \\&quot;knock-offs.\\&quot;  I purchased two separate orders.  The first one was old stock so I returned two big bottles of brown icky cream with no scent, at all.  I tried another seller but it was just not the same- that old familiar sweet lingering scent is not there.  Finally, I looked up the website for Alyssa Ashley and realized that they have a distributor in the US.  When my order came in, got the original bottles with the golden embossed brand name all over them.  The smell lasts longer, just how I remember it.  Couldn&#x27;t be any happier.  I still recommend the lotion but, beware of the imitations...</li>
    <li> this body lotion is great for everyday use, soft, not grease, and with a delicate perfume... I give it as a gift and it was a good choice.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the perfume.</li>
    <li> Good product, Amazon quick shipping as always</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife has been wearing Alyssa Ashley cologne for years. It is hands down my favorite female fragrance. I saw this and in spite of some negative reviews took a chance on it. I was pleasantly surprised and pleased when it arrived. It has the same soft fragrance that I love in the cologne. The fragrance last a long time and with the dry winter weather it is being used almost daily. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love musk &amp; am always looking for lotions.  This is quite a large size and scent is nice.  A little bit strong for me so I dilute it with unscented lotion.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes musk.</li>
    <li> Wonderful skin lotion with a nice scent that makes skin feel soft and smell good.  Have used it for years and will continue to use product provided the price doesn&#x27;t increase.</li>
    <li> I also bought the Alyssa Ashley Musk.  Both were very pleasing to me.  I love this fragrance, as I&#x27;ve said in my other review.  They both arrived fast and were as described.  This lotion makes your skin feel softer, and smell good. You don&#x27;t even need to use the oil to smell good.  I would recommend this to others if they are in the market for body lotion.</li>
