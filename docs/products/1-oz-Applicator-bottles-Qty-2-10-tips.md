      <li>This kit is perfect for anyone who wants more precision than the standard cones offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>though if you want to use then fine lines and hand writing.</li>

      <li>If they were smaller or the plastic was thinner allowing it to squeezed easier, they&#x27;d be great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great with the different tips to practice.</li>
      <li>they are not 1 time use they clean easy</li>
      <li>I wish they were easy to clean though.</li>
      <li>Overall, these are great.</li>
      <li>cheap</li>
      <li>My hand was even sore the next day lol.</li>
      <li>Excited to try out my henna art.</li>
      <li>Their size made them perfect for getting into the hard to reach places.</li>
      <li>Got here really fast :)  </li>
      <li>10.99 is a good deal for these 2 bottles and various tips.</li>
      <li>Clog easy recommend hot water and a spritz of cleaner to remove clogged stuff.</li>
      <li>It was easy to get out most of the unused glue and clean the bottle without wasting to much and the soft bottle also made it easy to control the flow.</li>
      <li>This is an outstanding product and even more so when considering the bang for the buck at this low price.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and I like that there are doubles too.</li>
      <li>This applicator is perfect, as it comes with different sized nozzles, although with the smaller applicators, the henna would get stuck and it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>but she currently uses the darkest self tanner in each bottle and lets her design sit on the skin for an hour or two and gets the same beautiful henna tattoo result!</li>
      <li>I do think that 1 bottle and 1 or 2 tips would be adequate.</li>
      <li>So far I have tried putting them in hot water, poking the holes wig needles and then running them under luke warm water while blowing on the holes.</li>
      <li>exactly as pictured!  </li>
      <li>I love using these, and they work great for making henna type designs on pottery with underglaze, but it doesn&#x27;t take long at all for the tip to get clogged and then its completely unusable and there is no way to clean it or clear the clog.</li>
      <li>Worth the buy</li>
      <li>but if I list them and type the word s3IIer correctly, Amazon&#x27;s filter deletes my review even though it&#x27;s 100% complimentary.  </li>
      <li>But they make it easy to do really long, nice lines, and they&#x27;re easy enough to clean</li>
      <li>I got my henna kit yesterday and have already used the new tips, they&#x27;re great for outlining and small details :) and the bottles are a flexible plastic</li>
      <li>This henna washed off right away.</li>
      <li>Very time consuming clean up.</li>
      <li>They delivered in no less then three days and it is super easy to handle and use.</li>
      <li>They get clogged easy if you do not sift, or have a needle on hand to clear out the applicators tube.</li>
      <li>These bottles wear out your hand very fast.</li>
      <li>Be sure you have a beading needle to clear the extra fine tips.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Could use more smaller bottles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure once she feels confident enough, she will try the henna dye next!</li>
      <li>The holes are really tiny which is great to get the job done, but SUPER HARD to clean.</li>
      <li>I loved the concept behind this and was excited to receive it.</li>
      <li>The seller shipped it really quick and had no trouble whatsoever with them.</li>
      <li>Very hard to squeeze but, very nice applicator.</li>
      <li>Squeezing them causes too much pressure on the thumb.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much easier to use</li>
      <li>This was great while I was really learning henna and cones were harder on my wrists and harder to control.</li>
      <li>These will make my henna designs so much easier to apply, can&#x27;t wait to start using them.</li>
      <li>The applicators are new and the bottles have just the right thickness to manage a steady flow of henna.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Honestly stick to cones. These bottles wear out your hand very fast. Glad that only $10 was wasted</li>
    <li> VERY speedy delivery and great product</li>
    <li> I got my henna kit yesterday and have already used the new tips, they&#x27;re great for outlining and small details :) and the bottles are a flexible plastic so they&#x27;re easy to squeeze. I will definitely buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> These bottles are great if you want to do really intricate patterns. I mix my own henna and put it into these bottles by cutting a hole in the bottom of a zip lock baggy. I only use the two thickest tips, though, because the henna is hard to get out of the smaller ones (you have to press REALLY hard, and that&#x27;s not really easy to do when you&#x27;re doing someone&#x27;s mehndi, you need to be able to go for a while.) But they make it easy to do really long, nice lines, and they&#x27;re easy enough to clean (I use the smaller tips to clean out the middle of the bigger ones.) Overall, these are great. I just need to buy bigger bottles to store my mixture in.</li>
    <li> I bought this for easy application of chocolate drizzle on strawberries... I guess I didn&#x27;t read the fact that it said 1 oz bottles because I expected the bottles and tips to be a bit bigger, but they accomplished what I needed them to and arrived before time!</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with this kit! It arrived quickly and I like that there are doubles too.</li>
    <li> I love using these, and they work great for making henna type designs on pottery with underglaze, but it doesn&#x27;t take long at all for the tip to get clogged and then its completely unusable and there is no way to clean it or clear the clog. I don&#x27;t have any kind of wire or needle thin enough to ream out the tips so I keep having to throw them away.</li>
    <li> They were just what I needed. Have used them on some of my crafts.</li>
    <li> I use these for squirting water on my palette for watercolors. But, you can use them for a lot of things. Different sized tips. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Helpful with applying more detailed henna patterns. They get clogged easy if you do not sift, or have a needle on hand to clear out the applicators tube.</li>
    <li> Henna paste did not come out of these</li>
    <li> Great product and even greater customer service!</li>
    <li> Just as advertised, they work perfectly and are easy to clean after you are finished.</li>
    <li> I did not like these for a couple of reasons. The first one being that it is very time consuming and difficult to get the henna inside of the bottle! I used a carrot bag and still was difficult and messy, and it made me waste quite a bit of Henna. Also, these bottles are EXTREMELY hard to squeeze the henna out! My designs came out horrible because I was squeezing so hard that my hand would shake trying to get it out. My hand was even sore the next day lol. Finally, they are super hard to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought these bottles for getting wood glue into the open joints of some furniture pieces I was repairing.  Their size made them perfect for getting into the hard to reach places. It was easy to get out most of the unused glue and clean the bottle without wasting to much and the soft bottle also made it easy to control the flow. Perfect tool for the job.</li>
    <li> great product for henna. makes application easy for me. i prefer these types of bottles over bags because it offers me a little more precision.</li>
    <li> Works great, doesnt leak and is easy to apply henna. I use this to place henna on myself.</li>
    <li> I like how i have a variety of sizes along with the two bottles so i can have two different size tips at the same time.</li>
    <li> These bottles are a bit hard to use. Squeezing them causes too much pressure on the thumb. If they were smaller or the plastic was thinner allowing it to squeezed easier, they&#x27;d be great. Otherwise, prepare an ice pack for your thumb after each use.</li>
    <li> This henna washed off right away. I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hard to squeeze. Tips get clogged easily.</li>
    <li> They delivered in no less then three days and it is super easy to handle and use. I love using these bottles for all my henna creations. I am never going back to my cone. Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought these bottles  and tips 4 times they are great to store product in then you can just change the top and add tip to use. they are not 1 time use they clean easy</li>
    <li> I worried if the plastic on these bottles would be stiff, but they were just right. This was great while I was really learning henna and cones were harder on my wrists and harder to control. Now, I use cones but I would HIGHLY recommend these for beginners. It&#x27;s also great with the different tips to practice.</li>
    <li> The product is new and as described. The seller shipped it really quick and had no trouble whatsoever with them. The applicators are new and the bottles have just the right thickness to manage a steady flow of henna.</li>
    <li> I bought these to do Henna Tattoo&#x27;s and I&#x27;m so impressed. the Tips are all different sizes for thin or thick lines. It held up well. If you&#x27;re worried about clumping, don&#x27;t I used my non stop for 2 hours. make sure you clean right away from any getting dried and hard from preventing you to use them again.</li>
    <li> I use these for henna and they are perfect. The plastic isn&#x27;t too hard and the tips aren&#x27;t too small.</li>
    <li> Watered down my henna as possible as I could and the henna still wouldn&#x27;t come out of the tubes :(</li>
    <li> I spend some time looking over the different options for henna applicator bottles on Amazon.  I chose this one because of the number of different tips and the extra bottle.  I am new to henna, so it could be the quality of my powder, but I find that I can only use the 2 biggest tips (the 18 and 19 gauge).  It simply won&#x27;t come out of the smaller tips.  But the flow depends a lot on how hard you squeeze.  The quality is good and the service was excellent.  The only thing I would change is ordering the cheaper package with fewer tips/bottles.  I do think that 1 bottle and 1 or 2 tips would be adequate.</li>
    <li> exactly as pictured!  Got here really fast :)  will be ordering from more!  Excited to try out my henna art.</li>
    <li> These are great for doing precise henna tattoos.</li>
    <li> Good for hena, Easy to clean</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product and even more so when considering the bang for the buck at this low price.  I also would like to compliment Henna City (the s3lIer) for a lot of things but if I list them and type the word s3IIer correctly, Amazon&#x27;s filter deletes my review even though it&#x27;s 100% complimentary.  Craziest chit I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Anyway, they are great, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The bottles and tips were as I expected.  They came in time for my upcoming henna party.  I wish they sold more bottles with the tips.  This was a great deal.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t squeeze anything of out any size applicator. Maybe the henna was too thick but still...</li>
    <li> cheap but they do the job.</li>
    <li> These are great bottles and tips. I&#x27;ve used them for both henna and underglaze on clay. They produce a nice clean line, although they do best when mostly full. Be sure you have a beading needle to clear the extra fine tips. A pin only fits in the larger gauge ones. Henna City is a great company to work with, and the shipping was nice and quick.</li>
    <li> i was soooooooo disappointed that such a fancy set does nothing in real...i can never get my henna/mehndi to come out of those small syringes no matter how thin i make the paste.. only bigger ones work which were not even required i feel any simple syringe will work for that thick line...Big disappointment just a waste!</li>
    <li> Worked good to apply glue under flooring. Would buy again. Could use more smaller bottles.</li>
    <li> I use there for henna tattoos and they work great! The smallest needle is so small, I can&#x27;t ever get henna to come out if it! It&#x27;s a great range if little needle sizes perfect for henna.</li>
    <li> Very hard to squeeze but, very nice applicator.</li>
    <li> I recieved the bottles today and they seem to be of very good Quality. Shippment was very quick and packaged nicely. 10.99 is a good deal for these 2 bottles and various tips. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> These are really good to work with paints and glue. Really easy to assemble and take it off. I wish they were easy to clean though. The holes are really tiny which is great to get the job done, but SUPER HARD to clean. So far I have tried putting them in hot water, poking the holes wig needles and then running them under luke warm water while blowing on the holes. Very time consuming clean up. Worth the buy though if you want to use then fine lines and hand writing.</li>
    <li> I started practicing Henna for project grad. This kit worked out perfectly. The smaller gauges get clogged easily, other than that I really like this kit .</li>
    <li> I love doing henna! I use this bottle set everytime. The needles come in sizes from the smallest to decently big. They&#x27;re easy to clean and I just love them.</li>
    <li> The bottles work great for applying henna! I prefer the largest tip for smoothest lines and better stain. They are easy to clean when youre done and the closed cap is perfect for storing your henna. Just perfect. Dont hesitate its a great buy :)</li>
    <li> Best applicator if you are trying to learn the art of Henna</li>
    <li> MAKES EVERYTHING EASIER</li>
    <li> My purchase came within 3 days. I tried using them with henna paste and made an exquisite design with amazing detail, thanks to these fine tips. They are easy to clean, and the bottles are easy to squeeze. My order came with a nice coupon offer, and it was shipped in a sturdy box. This is my new place to buy all my mehndi applicator supplies!</li>
    <li> Does not work well with henna at all.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter. She loves them. She has not ever used henna but she currently uses the darkest self tanner in each bottle and lets her design sit on the skin for an hour or two and gets the same beautiful henna tattoo result! I&#x27;m sure once she feels confident enough, she will try the henna dye next! Great buy!</li>
    <li> This kit is perfect for anyone who wants more precision than the standard cones offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who wants to apply henna with great precision.</li>
    <li> Bottle is too big and hard to squeeze out henna.. A waste of money .. I recommend buying the half oz it&#x27;s much easier to use</li>
    <li> I loved the concept behind this and was excited to receive it. But I was massively disappointed when I attempted to use it for the first time. The tips would not squeeze out my henna paste and I ended up giving up entirely after trying all the different tips. You also have to squeeze very hard just to get a blob of your product to come out.</li>
    <li> service is real good and the product is good  too i have liked it</li>
    <li> They came in see rate Ziploc style bottles with. I like MSD.sheets. we&#x27;re plain and have so far worked decently. I use for my henna designs. Clog easy recommend hot water and a spritz of cleaner to remove clogged stuff.</li>
    <li> This applicator is perfect, as it comes with different sized nozzles, although with the smaller applicators, the henna would get stuck and it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Henna Application</li>
    <li> They actually came sooner than I had expected them, and were exactly what I had hoped for.  These will make my henna designs so much easier to apply, can&#x27;t wait to start using them. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The bottles are VERY hard to squeeze out the henna.</li>
    <li> horrible very hard to use it heart u r hands not good at alll</li>
