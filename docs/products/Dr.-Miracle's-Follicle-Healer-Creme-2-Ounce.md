<li> amazed at how much healthier hair appeared, Will keep using, and hopefully can get the thin spots to thicken up.&lt;br /&gt;Had a issue in Hospital hair started to fall out and get thin.</li>
<li> You just have to use very little (on brows) and along the hairline (for hair).  </li>

<li> Relieves itch after having it on scalp for at least 20 minutes.</li>

    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it does anything because it&#x27;s a little sticky so don&#x27;t wanna put on my hair while wet. I only use when hair is about to get washed and ponytail days.</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it with Gro aut oil to help grow my hair. So far I have seen a significant amount of improvement. Great product</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE SAMPLE YOU SENT ME..STILL TRYING TO FIND FLLICLE HEALER IN STORE AND BEAUTY MART..THEY HAVE ALL OF DR MIRACLE&#x27;S OTHER PRODUCTS BUT NO THIS ON YET WILL HAVE TO ORDER ON LINE</li>
    <li> I might good for someone else, But it didn&#x27;t work for someone else whom a cancer survivor.</li>
    <li> AMAZING  PRODUCT.  IT  REALLY  WORKS.</li>
    <li> This product was not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I saw no difference. The jar is too small &amp; pricy for it not to work. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this product to grow out my hair (have only been using for a week so don&#x27;t notice much there yet), but I placed it onto my VERY over plucked brows and they are growing crazy!  They still have a bit to go, but I use this product and than place Castor Oil &amp; Coconut Oil over it (which I heard helps the growth....I use Castor Oil during the day and Coconut Oil at night)....but I am growing hairs that wouldn&#x27;t grow out...I am hoping that my hair follows suit, but I am being realistic about my hair (as it does take a bit longer)....it also has a great smell.  It will tingle a little, but than it goes away.  You just have to use very little (on brows) and along the hairline (for hair).  Also, this is GREAT for ALL HAIR types...</li>
    <li> This is my first time i ever purchased this product. I love all Dr. Miracles products and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> Tried this at night but cap on for 30min. took off and slept with this in my hair. Next morning washed out and styled.&lt;br /&gt;Was amazed at how much healthier hair appeared, Will keep using, and hopefully can get the thin spots to thicken up.&lt;br /&gt;Had a issue in Hospital hair started to fall out and get thin. So, been a adventure finding the right products, But I think&lt;br /&gt;after one application I can tell a big difference. pleasant smell, and you can feel the tingle on the scalp.</li>
    <li> I bought the pomade and the crème in this product I prefer the crème because it is lighter and less greasy I love the tingly feeling and my hair is healthy and growing</li>
    <li> I have itchy scalp without dandruff. This is the ONLY product I have used that gives me immediate lasting relief without weighing my hair down. Can no longer find in my local market. Glad I located on Amazon! :-):-)</li>
    <li> Love the tingle! Item as described.</li>
    <li> Like it...wish it had a different fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is ok but not is as good as the pomade. When using the pomade you can feel it working because you can feel the tingling sensation on your scalp.</li>
    <li> I can feel it tingle on my scalp. I hope it&#x27;s working. I don&#x27;t see any improvement in hair growth yet. It has to be stimulating my hair follicles.</li>
    <li> I nearly finish the product, i can tell it is reduce the Itching. but i can&#x27;t see any other advantage.&lt;br /&gt;it is gone quickly with any shampoo. i used bot it in my hear and sleep and when i wake up i wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it to whom suffer of Itching.</li>
    <li> Has not helped my issue. True, it moisturizes, but no hair growth in sparse follicle areas. Perhaps another product will be able to.</li>
    <li> Works better than the Dr.miracles follicle healing oil. Relieves itch after having it on scalp for at least 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as described</li>
    <li> Love It! has improved the look and overall feel of my hair. Recommend it to anyone who has problem with thinning hair,</li>
    <li> This item is great by all means. Highly recommended and t makes your scalp feel great. Try it, you will be very satisfied.</li>
    <li> She wanted to relax her hair without chemicals. This did not work for her. This doesn&#x27;t mean that the product did not heal her follicles. It did what she wanted, she seems to have wanted a different product.She doesn&#x27;t want a relaxer but a product that will relax her natural curls without chemicals. I will continue to support this company, which caters to black girls like me. When I called to ask about the source of an ingredient, the receptionist was more than kind and very forthright. i trust them with my hair.</li>
    <li> This is my second time using this product I like it. It has it in the creme and regular version. Very cool and tinkling. It has a great feel and smell. I recommend this hair formula. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> It works! High stress was taking a toll...found out about product on Dr Miracle&#x27;s website. Figure -- give it a try. The tingle was awesome, and product relieved the itching. I could feel my hair growing back -- and it was! In one week it sprouted and in 1 month, it&#x27;s over 2 inches. You gotta try this -- thank you Dr Miracle!</li>
