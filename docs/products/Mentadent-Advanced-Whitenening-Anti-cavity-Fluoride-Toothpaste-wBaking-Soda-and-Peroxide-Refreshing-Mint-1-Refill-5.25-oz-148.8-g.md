<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Best toothpaste ever used.</li>
    <li> Mentadent is great.  It cleans my teeth well and tastes nice.  But the reason I buy it is for the convenience. It is so much easier to dispense than any other toothpaste I have used.  I wish every toothpaste came with these dispensers.</li>
    <li> It is impossible to find Mentadent toothpaste in this area. I was glad to find it because it is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> My family has used mentadent since it came out. The dispenser is so easy to operate, the product is awesome, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> I love Mentadent.  It has truly been a blessing to me and my teeth.  It feels good when you go to the dentist and he/she tells you \\&quot;NO CAVITIES\\&quot;    I give this product *****</li>
    <li> Love it! These are so hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using Mentadent Toothpaste for years.  A few months ago, it disappeared from the shelves of our local retailers.  Having combed the town looking for it, we decided he was going to have to choose a new toothpaste.  I told him I&#x27;d try one more thing.  I looked on Amazon and there it was!  Next time I&#x27;m looking for something, I&#x27;ll try Amazon first!</li>
    <li> We keep on coming back for more!</li>
    <li> Excellent toothpaste. Best part is the container. No more squeezing the tube and no more mess!</li>
    <li> MY WHOLE FAMILY HAS BEEN USING THIS MENTADENT TOOTHPASTE FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND IT IS THE BEST TOOTHPASTE EVER!!!!!  OUR FAMILY OF 5 IS CAVITY FREE AND WE ALL HAVE PEARLY WHITES!!!! TRY IT FOR YOURSELF TODAY AND I&#x27;M SURE YOU WILL AGREE!!!</li>
    <li> Item received from this vendor.  Packaging was old.  When package was opened, brown dirt and residue inside the box.  Very unsanitary.    Also the price was for 3 packs, only sent one.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased that we can find Mentadent online, very few stores in our area carry it. We&#x27;ll order it again if it stays available here and the price was right too.</li>
    <li> Still the best toothpaste out there ................. thankfully, there&#x27;s Amazon, because there is no longer anyplace to buy it \\&quot;off the shelf\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I swear by mentadent.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a while but it was hard to find so Amazon was great!  Minty fresh and great whitening protection!  And I&#x27;ve never had a cavity!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the super clean feeling I get from Mentadent toothpaste, but it disappeared from stores.  Glad to have found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> My daughter paid $5 just for one refill at the store the other day. Mentadent was recommended to me by the dental hygienist years ago and I have been using it ever since. The only problem is it is hard to find. This is a good deal and a great price.</li>
    <li> After buying this at Costco a few years passed, when I could no longer find it there, I looked here and Amazon has plenty as usual. Well its a good buy on a great product, and it is all that I prefer to use regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brand toothpaste for the past 15 years and am very satisfied with it. I use it with an electric tooth brush -Phi brand. Wally quit selling it for quite a few years (at least at my store in New Mexico) so started buying it here. Good deal and they are never out.</li>
    <li> I love Mentadent and have used it for years.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Been using Mentadent for years. Thank goodness Amazon sells it. I have very sensitive teeth due to receding gums. Mentadent is great for this. Used Sensodyne on a recent trip because a tube takes up less room in a suitcase. My mouth did not feel as clean.</li>
    <li> They discontinued carrying this product in the stores.  So I have to order it online only. I am happy and pleased with the results of this toothpaste/whitener.</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended Mentadent to my husband for him to use several time a week on his gums, in addition to his regular toothpaste.  He is very satisfied with this product and is confident that it is keeping his gums healthy.</li>
    <li> I have always been buying via subscription and noticed that the stores are selling 2pk for $4.99 which is $2.50 per item&lt;br /&gt;That is a huge cost difference. I will be canceling my online order due to the huge difference in pricing.</li>
    <li> I love my Amazon Subscribe &amp; Save program. The $ that I save on the value packs &amp; 5 quantity savings per month on the program as an Amazon member &amp; this toothpaste is the best by far. I love the dispenser!</li>
    <li> My husband has Parkinson&#x27;s and this toothpaste is easy for him to use, much easier than a tube.  It also tastes good and feels refreshing.</li>
    <li> we have used this toothpaste for years. We cannot find it at our local big store always so it&#x27;s nice that Amazon offers it especially the subdcribe and save.</li>
    <li> like very much, looks good on the bathroom counter.  better than a rolled uo tube of past. Very good service. Would do again.</li>
    <li> My biggest problem with most toothpaste is that even after repeated rinsing I feel like there is still some kind of toothpaste film in my mouth that I can&#x27;t get rid of. This toothpaste has a very strong but refreshing mint flavor and rinses very cleanly leaving no weird toothpasty filmy feeling in my mouth. Its a bit on the pricier side for toothpaste but I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> It cleans teeth well, but for a while my teeth getting more sensitive. I guess it out of the store shelves for a reason.</li>
    <li> I lonly use Mentadent. Usually I can only get boxes with another new base, so I was pleased to find a double refil without the base. This is a great toothpaste. Gets your mouth feeling really clean and in between the teeth. Good buy.</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste ever, I have not had a cavity since I stated using it 20 years ago.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste that I am partial to is too expensive, so I gave this one a try, it gets the job done, no real complaints</li>
    <li> This is ideal for those who hate large clumps of paste on their sink.  The efficient and clean design gets better each time.  I get a nice clean feeling every time I use it, and my dentist has noted improved results.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste as it feels clean in the mouth, not messy on the sink and my breath feels fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Mentadent user for years and it&#x27;s impossible to find in stores.  Happy that Amazon carried it in a multipack.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> fully met my expectations and the product is great. I like the fact that it fits in my medicine cabinet</li>
    <li> This is the only place I can get this toothpaste, my local drugstores or grocery stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  Glad to have a source.</li>
    <li> My husband greatly enjoys this toothpaste as well as its convenience.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tastes great and seems to work well (no cavities at my last check up!).  The design is perfect, mixing the two components together on your toothbrush with a simple push on the top of the apparatus.  The dispenser cap can be closed to keep the toothpaste fresh.  Great product, but the \\&quot;whiter teeth in seven days\\&quot; is likely for people who either never brush their teeth or have recent, light stains.</li>
    <li> I need some more Mentadent .  Please send me two more.  It is the best tooth paste.</li>
    <li> Last 4 dental appts I have had good exams</li>
    <li> My wife and I both love this product.  It has become hard to find.  Thanks Amazon for keeping it in your stock.</li>
    <li> I have been looking in stores for this brand, but can never find it. I finally found it on Amazon...and bought a bunch of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the dispenser...the only issue is that when you first insert a new toothpaste unit into the base, you won&#x27;t get both sides coming out evenly...so that feels as if there is a little toothpaste waste at the onset. Overall, after using Colgate, Crest, Arm and Hammer toothpastes, I feel that this one leaves my mouth feeling the most clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Great product. Was glad to see Target started to carry it again</li>
    <li> I like the stand up dispenser, more hygienic.</li>
    <li> I had been so sad to discover that all my regular sources of Mentadent had disappeared, but finding it here was awesome! The Mentadent dispenser is what sold me and will keep me coming back! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product gets 5 stars, because it does what it promisses. Even though this is not immediately noticible, the fluoride saves money on the dentist, the toothpaste leaves your teeth smooth and it gets them white!!! I would recommand it to everybody!</li>
    <li> I fo0und this product years ago, and just rediscovered it last year.  Only problem that I have found is that it is hard to find in the stores now, so ordering on line seems to be the only option available.  Will be looking for another dispenser in the near future for the other bathroom....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all about the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we can discern little difference in the performance of one toothpaste over another, despite all the claims of whitening, plaque removal, breath freshening and germ killing, we definitely appreciate the convenience and cleanliness of the Mentadent dispensing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have always found the heavily handled, crimped, squeezed and crunched toothpaste tubes to be simply gross, especially in a household with multiple users. A minimum of contact is required to use every last drop of Mentadent. There is no &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; tube cap rolling onto the bathroom floor, no tube end blowouts, no leftovers to be pounded out of a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vertical aspect and small footprint allow the Mentadent dispenser to stay on the sink/vanity top where it is more readily put to use and much more convenient than fishing for a dirty tube in a debris filled vanity drawer or overcrowded medicine cabinet shelf.&lt;br /&gt;We keep using the same dispensing base and buying the refills. We recycle the disposable plastic dispensers. You can&#x27;t recycle a toothpaste tube, but you can recycle a Mentadent dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser works in a controlled manner, precisely placing the desired amount of toothpaste on one&#x27;s brush with no extra wastage. A 1/4&amp;#34; of paste on the brush is sufficient to fill the mouth with a refreshing, cleansing foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as Mentadent has been available, it has been our toothpaste of choice. Availability in grocery and drug stores has been spotty at times. We now purchase in multiples on Amazon. It ships free, using our Prime membership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not consider cost comparisons when purchasing this product. It justifies its self.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over 20 years and attribute it to having super white teeth. I love the convenience of the pump and will continue to buy it. I wish they made a flouride free version though.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my teeth clean and free from cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it also works well to relieve the itch of bug bites&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;may also work to polish metal as it is a fine abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s main job is still the teeth</li>
    <li> These are the only refills I buy - we&#x27;ve had our mentadent base for years (3-4+) and it still works great with these refills. The toothpaste is half white and half clear blue and has a good minty flavor, and I think it helps maintain whiteness.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years...Dentist saids its one of the best&lt;br /&gt;you can use. Never had problems with checkups.&lt;br /&gt;Very Convient to dispense...a little dab will do you !</li>
    <li> Nice and neat! No messy tubes to squeeze! Mentadent lasts a long time and is ready and easy to use on your counter top! You will find it has all the caring qualities for your teeth in an easy practical attractive container that just sits neatly on your counter top!</li>
    <li> Had a mix up on the initial review and gave it a bad review based on delivery. However, the error was mine and it was delivered.</li>
    <li> Not stocked at any stores in our area.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> My family has used this product for more than 10 years. We have been very satisfied with the results and our dentists continue to marvel that we have such healthy teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Excellent taste and great reports at the 6 month check ups.  Sometimes it seems to be a little bit gooey and messy when dispensing but otherwise a very good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This brand of tooth paste is excellent for gum treatment. Baking Soda &amp; peroxide is good for the gums. I have used this brand for years.  It treats the gums for healthier teeth. I highly recommend this tooth paste. If one has a gum problems try this..</li>
    <li> Love this product it works really great and i find i use less  toothpaste. Would highly recommend it to anyone and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste - makes my mouth feel so clean. Excellent product for a healthy mouth. I&#x27;ve used for 8 years and won&#x27;t change.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for a number of years, but for some reason it has been hard to find. I&amp;#34;m glad to be able to get it again! It is the best of all the major brands.</li>
    <li> Mentadent toothpaste has always been my family&#x27;s favorite.  Hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued as many products have.  You can&#x27;t really find these at the local drug stores anymore, so I buy a year&#x27;s worth at a time.  These won&#x27;t go bad if you store them well.</li>
    <li> nice merchandaise I will buy this product as needed I am a long time (many,many years)but make your comments shorter.</li>
    <li> I used the whitening paste for years but then had to switch to the anticavity fluoride because it was the only one I could find in stores in my area. For some reason most stores stopped carrying the brand completely. I started noticing that my teeth were getting yellow about a year after switching.  When I found the whitening paste on Amazon I was thrilled, it has taken a mere month for me to see the difference in my teeth!  They are slowly turning white again and I expect to be back to the &amp;#34;norm&amp;#34; within a few months.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the mint taste better than the other brands - It just makes my mouth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Mentadent for years.  The refills are hard to find and it was great to subscribe to Amazon to get them.  Unfortunately, the product has changed and the quality is not as good.  On my last two orders, 4 of 6 hinged caps broke off when we first used them.  The plastic is not as sturdy as it use to be.  Also, it seems that the consistency of the toothpaste has changed.  It&#x27;s runnier and drips out of the nozzle.  I finally decided to cancel my subscription and will find a different product.  I normally don&#x27;t review toothpaste, but thought people should know about the plastic hinge issue.</li>
    <li> Yes the expected product but Amazon charges double the Walmart price.</li>
    <li> I like Mentadent Toothpaste, not only because it is Whitening Anti-cavity, but because of the packaging.  I have a small bathroom with only a sink, shower and toilet and never know what to do with a tube of toothpaste. Mentadent solves the problem.  It sits on my sink, is convenient and refillable.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere for they original Mentadent, with no luck. This is next best. But the original has clear blue peroxide and tastey mint flavored baking soda paste.&lt;br /&gt;This one has a milky blue peroxide paste and&lt;br /&gt;(OK tasting) baking soda paste.</li>
    <li> best tooth paste I have ever used. my dental hygienist recommended. get a&#x27;s now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s convenient - so many stores have discontinued carrying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so silly to require a certain amount of words for these comments, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
    <li> love this toothpaste but it&#x27;s hard to find.  I got the ones with the pump before these are just the refills for anyone ordering for the first time.  You need the pump for it to work!</li>
