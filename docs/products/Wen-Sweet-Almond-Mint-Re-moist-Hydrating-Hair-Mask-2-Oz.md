      <li>I love using the wen products it is so much cheaper to order from Amazon compared to in television</li>

      <li>Just right for my hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great conditioner, I like it because your hair feels healthier, but not unmanageable for a couple days like a regular deep conditioner does.  </li>
      <li>once a month is more then enough</li>

      <li>and my hair is so much softer.  </li>
      <li>you order what you want and reorder when your ready plus on Amazon if you forget which product you ordered</li>
      <li>wen products have halped my hair tragedy so much</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I bought this before and it came with the start up kit for Wen and when you buy straight from Wen the introductory kit is cheaper than buying each item, so this is what I do.  </li>
      <li>And the smell of fresh mint and almond will stay in you hair for several days.</li>
      <li>The deep conditioning my hair receives helps my hair grab &amp; keep fresh color longer.</li>
      <li>i have pretty long hair</li>
      <li>Since using wen, my hair is much healthier and doesn&#x27;t look damaged after regular coloring and highlighting.  </li>
      <li>My hair was soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair...</li>
      <li>if i plan to put heat on my hair that day, i towel dry my hair until damp and then use the sweet almond mint styling cream pulling it from mid shaft to the tips and then continue to styling.</li>
      <li>I have super long curly hair and have really specific taste when it comes to what works on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Amazon has been my hero due to this happening because it is much cheaper through here than straight through Wen.  </li>
      <li>I suffer from dry brittle hair and this product makes my hair the exact opposite.</li>
      <li>It smoothes out my hair and tames the frizz during the day and leaves my hair soooo soft and manageable the next day.  </li>
      <li>The Wen Re-Moist hair Mask is one of the few things that is worth the money because it works so well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive than using regular products, but well worth the extra cost!</li>

    <li> Works good. Am just not a fan of the menthol smell.</li>
    <li> I have super long curly hair and have really specific taste when it comes to what works on my hair.  The Wen Re-Moist hair Mask is one of the few things that is worth the money because it works so well.  I actually don&#x27;t use the product the way they suggest. My hair tends to be frizzy so I use the cream as an all day leave-in conditioner.  It smoothes out my hair and tames the frizz during the day and leaves my hair soooo soft and manageable the next day.  Good Stuff!</li>
    <li> Now my favorite conditioner. I&#x27;m not crazy about the rest of their system but they knew what they were doing w the conditioner. I suffer from dry brittle hair and this product makes my hair the exact opposite. I use it 2 xs a Wk.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen products exclusively for over five years. I love how healthy and shiny my hair feels. I always use Sweet Almond Mint Re-moist Hydrating Hair Treatment one week before I color my hair. The deep conditioning my hair receives helps my hair grab &amp; keep fresh color longer. And the smell of fresh mint and almond will stay in you hair for several days.</li>
    <li> I bought this before and it came with the start up kit for Wen and when you buy straight from Wen the introductory kit is cheaper than buying each item, so this is what I do.  Unfortunately the kit used to have this in it, but they took it out now.  Amazon has been my hero due to this happening because it is much cheaper through here than straight through Wen.  I put it in and sleep with it once my hair is dry and I wash it out in the morning and my hair is so much softer.  Absolutely in love with the Wen hair care line.</li>
    <li> Smell good can&#x27;t wait to use</li>
    <li> very nice product. My hair was smooth but full bodied. I may try more of this product</li>
    <li> This is such small amount, I could not tell any difference in my hair after using it. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This saves my over colored and crunchy hair. Smells amazing!! Makes my hair blonder... But I recommend applying at night and rinsing in the morning. Amazing hair texture. I&#x27;ll add a few dabs to my unruly hair for compliments at work! Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I use it before styling..perfect</li>
    <li> where to start... i know there is a lot of controversy over wen because for some it burns their scalp and makes their hair fall out. me too, but it does go away after a few uses. i have pretty long hair and i am always so reluctant to cut it no matter how crispy it gets so i am always looking for deep conditioners and hair masques to prolong the life of my hair until it&#x27;s next trim. i use wen products in the following order: two pumps of the cleansing conditioner, massage my scalp and run my finger from root to tip then rinse. two more pumps and i let it sit on my hair for about ten-fifteen minutes. every three or four days i will use the deep conditioner in the same scent as the cleansing conditioner. if i plan to put heat on my hair that day, i towel dry my hair until damp and then use the sweet almond mint styling cream pulling it from mid shaft to the tips and then continue to styling. wen products have halped my hair tragedy so much and i will continue to purchase them when i run out.</li>
    <li> I have used wen products for a couple years now.  Occasionally, on vacation or when I run out I will have to use regular shampoo and I hate it when that happens!  I will never go back to regular shampoo or conditioner!  This is a great conditioner, I like it because your hair feels healthier, but not unmanageable for a couple days like a regular deep conditioner does.  I have fine hair that is extremely sensitive and gets dry and damaged easily.  Since using wen, my hair is much healthier and doesn&#x27;t look damaged after regular coloring and highlighting.  My hair always feels soft and has more shine.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than using regular products, but well worth the extra cost!</li>
    <li> Love the Wen products! After years of coloring I need the deep moisture to keep my hair from feeling brittle. This works beautifully! I love it. Want to try some other scents.</li>
    <li> once a month is more then enough</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Just right for my hair.This order arrived on time and in good condition. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Product is amazing! I had already used the Wen cleansing conditioners for the 4th time &amp; it has helped a bunch. I have naturally curly hair... Like Shirley Temple curly Lol! This product took the rest of the Friz away that the cleansing conditioner had yet to get. My hair was extremely damaged tho. I&#x27;m a firm believer... Will never use regular shampoos &amp; conditioners in my hair EVER again!</li>
    <li> Feels great in my hair and smelled great but not enough for longer hair thick hair and of course pricey for the amount.</li>
    <li> I really loved this product.  It really does work.  However it is very expensive and haven&#x27;t been able to order since this one.</li>
    <li> love this stuff just wish it came in a bigger container.</li>
    <li> love this product - great for curly hair</li>
    <li> Sweet almond products work great on my hair.  I love them and will buy them again.</li>
    <li> I did as the product suggested to leave it overnight and to wash it out in the morning.  My hair was soft and manageable.  I love wen and will be a wen girl for LIFE</li>
    <li> I love using the wen products it is so much cheaper to order from Amazon compared to in television I heard the horror stories after the trial people would cancel but the system works continue to bill you the 59.00-79.00 but the customer service reps do not assist you in clearing up and refunding your money compare to Amazon you order what you want and reorder when your ready plus on Amazon if you forget which product you ordered you can go back and check out previous purchases. It&#x27;s s great product and a lot better prices than on line thru Wen website. I tried the pomegranate and mint they work. Like the commercial says im a wen girl only downfall you go thru the 32oz so fast so I flip from regular shampoo to wen. Hope anyone who orders for first time will agree Amazon is cheaper plus wen is a great product for all hair types .</li>
