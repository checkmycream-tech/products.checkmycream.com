    <li> Great buy on my favorite holding spray.  I usually pay the same amount for the purse size spray.  Arrived very quickly as well.</li>
    <li> all things Biosilk are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I can say with 100% certainty that is one of the worst products I have used on my hair. My hair felt and looked like I had sprayed oil onto my hair. It looked so bad I wanted to rewash my hair but unfortunately I was running late to an appointment. Needless to say I walked out the door with greasy looking hair that looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in days. Also, my hair went flat immediately after I sprayed this on my hair. Just plain awful product, it should receive zero stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not sticky!! That&#x27;s what I prefer in a spray.</li>
    <li> Light scent that fades quickly. Good, light hold, and not at all crunchy. Even my boyfriend uses this because it doesn&#x27;t smell girly and has a natural finish.</li>
    <li> What I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I love the biosilk finishing hairspray. It is soft to the touch while holding your hair style. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray.  Just enough hold without stiffness, good for my hair.  It&#x27;s perfect for the humid climate where I live.</li>
    <li> Extremely pleased with my purchase and thank you! I will be back to check out other items. Thanks you so much.</li>
    <li> Perfect light-weight glossing spray; a little goes a long way, so use sparingly. No greasy build-up, smells great.</li>
    <li> I bought this because others said it left their hair soft. I can&#x27;t believe that, my hair is hard and stiff like a helmet.</li>
    <li> smells awful and can&#x27;t return. what a waste of money. It not only smells bad going on, but continues to smell bad. And because it is considered a hazardous material, I can&#x27;t even return it. Really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this spray...no complaints. Good hold, and no dulling of hair. Leaves hair looking very natural.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both use this hairspray.  Great product.  It holds but not sticky.  You can comb your hair and still use this.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the item pictured.</li>
    <li> I typically buy this hairspray from the salon where I have my hair done and have used it for years and love it. So when I saw it here for a lower price, I was so excited.  Trust me, the excitement was short lived.  I thought since it was being sold by Amazon that it would be legit.  Do not waste your money or time on this. It is NOT the real Biosilk finishing spray. This stuff leaves your hair, sticky and stiff/coarse like straw....crunchy and very unnatural.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all. I hope that I just happened to get two bad cans of it, but I&#x27;m not taking that chance again.  I&#x27;ll stick to what I know is real from the salon.</li>
    <li> This is a great spray  Not stiff or stickey</li>
    <li> Best spray I have purchased.  thank you</li>
    <li> This hairspray does not have a strong hairspray scent. It does not excessively dry out the hair and it is great for taming flyaways. If you like a stiff and strong hold this hairspray is not for you. It is natural and wonderful!</li>
    <li> This hairspray does the trick.  Holds the hair, yet keeps it soft.  Very grateful someone shared it with me and will continue to buy it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work, but it had absolutely no hold at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had so much trouble finding hairspray that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; my hairstyle before it dries, then leaves residue that clogs my curling iron, etc.  This hairspray is light and holds very well without buildup.</li>
    <li> I use all Biosilk hair products.  The natural hold style spray and firm hold are 2 must haves.&lt;br /&gt;Does NOT dry hair, brushes out, no stickiness and lots of shine.&lt;br /&gt;Very fine mist so dries instantly.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE BIOSILK !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I really like this product--in fact I just ordered it again. It doesn&#x27;t smell, doesn&#x27;t leave a trace so that it is obvious and has no scent plus it gives a light hold which is also something I wanted. if these are is what you want in a spray, buy this product. You won&#x27;t regret it..</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My hair does not feel stiff......</li>
    <li> Even my mother tried it and wanted her own bottle.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT....I have used this product for several years, and have colored my hair even longer!!(25 years)&lt;br /&gt;It will your hair soft and flexible w/ a light sheen.</li>
    <li> Great hair product holds hair well.</li>
