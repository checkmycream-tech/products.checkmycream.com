<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There&#x27;s about 3 brushes that she said she&#x27;ll never use but the rest of them are great.  She does well with these.  It&#x27;s maybe been a year or two... I don&#x27;t remember exactly but... there you go, they last. Some she uses daily some she uses once or twice a month.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with these brushes. Yes, the case does smell, but it clearly states that the case is \\&quot;synthetic leather.\\&quot; As previous reviewers said, if you rub it down with alcohol and let it air out it doesn&#x27;t smell. I don&#x27;t keep them in the case anyway, I have mine organized by purpose in little vases on my vanity. The variety is amazing. Some brushes do shed, however, I have a MAC 187 that I put my concealer on with that sheds even worse than these. All in all these are a great value and I would recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I saw these brushes; I am a poor college student with a makeup obsession. Haha, not the best combination.    I had a feeling they weren&#x27;t going to be the best quality brushes, but I decided to give them a shot. When I finally got them, I was so dissapointed. The quality was horrible, the hairs were falling out, and they wouldn&#x27;t even apply the eyeshadow as well as my other brushes (CVS Brand). I returned them the next day because I was so dissapointed in their quality. My suggestion is to not buy them. Go go a near by CVS or Target and purchase their brushes. They may cost a little more, but you&#x27;ll be pleased with their quality.     My bottom line here: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I got the most for my money. They are awesome brushes. I use these every morning when I do my makeup. I can not believe all the brushes that I have in my collection now. The holder is nice too. They are great for blending. I had them at my door the very next day after my order. I was really happy and would totally order these as a gift for anyone that loves makeup as much as I do.</li>
    <li> These brushes do have a weird smell to them that last quit a while. I do like all the small eye brushes but the bigger face brushes are horrible, they are prickly and the bristles fall out all over your face. I do love the giant case that i can replace the brushes i dont like.</li>
    <li> I orderd the product a week before the secret santa game. The product arrived just in time! Excellent product and punctual. Plus the receiver was overly excited.</li>
    <li> Bought this thinking it was gonna be a GREAT purchase. When i received the package, let me tell you i was VERY disappointed. The brushes felt really cheaply made and to top it off, one of the handles of the brushes came BROKEN!!!! Big value but soooo not worth the $31. I will be sending this back and I have already ordered another set from a different maker. The only reason why I gave these brushes 2 stars is because they came pretty fast in the mail. \\&quot;Considering i live all the way in Hawaii.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The brushes were good, the case was fine too, it did not have any smell or fragrance that some people complain of (they must be extremely sensitive to smells).  The set did contain almost all brushes you need, except i wish there were more dome brushes in it.  I also like a flat foundation brush which i believe this did not have.  The packaging is fine, but i ended up almost NEVER using this product because i bought it for personal use and at home i would have preferred the brushes to come in a box or case so i can stand them up so they would be ready to go because when you open up the whole case that they currently come in, it is very long and takes up a lot of space and you have to flip open the top cover, take the brush out.  It&#x27;s not quick, easy and convenient.  Unless you are a patient person.  As i mentioned, i would have preferred if they came in a standing box/case in which you could open them all and pick up/put down quick.  I am leaving out one star for this reason and also since i wish it had more brush shapes, but if you are a beginner and enthuiastic in getting your first professional brush set, this is definitely a good value that is priced well and includes a great variety.</li>
    <li> Im not a make up artist or anything like that but i have used a wide variety of brushes, from MAC to Bobbi Brown, to Sephora Collection, to the drug store brand, these brushes are a pretty good quality for the price, considering the fact that there are so many of them which is good when your doing some eyeshadow blending and such. Overall pretty good :)</li>
    <li> I recently purchased these brushes, washed and cleaned them before use and I must say that so far i&#x27;m impressed. When I started using them they shed very little compared to another brush set I purchased from a different company which was valued over $100.00  I never knew what it was to have a brush that sheds a lot - in all the years i&#x27;ve been using makeup brushes. When I compared the bundle monster to the other brush set, the bundle monster worked better and shed less. Less as in one or two hairs coming out when using.  I love them and would recommend to anyone who wants to save cash and still have decent brushes.</li>
    <li> I received this product in perfect condition and the leather carrier that it comes in its perfect. Screw spending so much money on a similar item, this product does the same and works great. I would definitely purchase from this seller again!!!</li>
    <li> The big brushes aren&#x27;t good but the smaller ones are. They do shed but I use them all the time. I didn&#x27;t notice any smell that the other reviewers said they did.</li>
    <li> You can tell that these brushes are cheap. I love playing with make up but dont love paying high prices for the name brand products. Although the brushes are cheap I think for the price its a great value. There are SO many different brushes to choose from. I tried using conceler with one of the brushes and it didnt so so well. I&#x27;m not a professional by any means so maybe it wasnt ment for applying face make up...needless I would only use brushes for powder product.</li>
    <li> This was a really good priced make up kit.  You most definitely get a good deal for the money!  It came very quickly and was packed with a protecting material which I appreciate because this is a Christmas gift.  Better than I expected!!</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for. all the smaller brushes are great but the bigger brushes arent great threw them out and never used them. but the smaller brushes worked fine and i like them. but its a really good product for beginners and for people who dont wanna spend 40 bucks on a mac brush (like myself :-p) but its good just throw out the bigger brushes..</li>
    <li> this brushes dont last a week, terrible quality in every brush. The one thing i like is the leather holder.. nothing else. There are brushes for a 10 year old</li>
    <li> Ive gotten my brushes today! They came a day before the estimated delivery date which is a plus. I was super excited. I opened them up and they did smell like paint, atleast to me, but im an artist so I didnt mind the smell at all. The shadow brushes, extremely soft. The powder brushes, sheds but im not a makeup artist. Im just a 19 year old college girl whos on a budget. Theyre not as bad as people say they are. Oh, and the base of the brushes are cheap but hey, I rate them a C....Cant Complain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, and I&#x27;ve actually just began trying to wear makeup. Anyway, these are some nice brushes for someone who is just beginning to wear make up.  [...] bucks is an great price for 34 brushes.</li>
    <li> horrible quality. the brushes are too rough.</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a brand conscious person when it comes to certain items and would love to have the Mac brand of brushes, however, Mac brushes are way out of my price range.  These brushes are an excellent alternative to the Mac brushes, and at a fraction of the price.  From what I have experienced, the brushes are of good quality and don&#x27;t shed.  The leather storage pouch is not cheap and cheesy looking either.</li>
    <li> Makeup has been a hobby of mine for a while now; though I&#x27;m not a makeup artist, I know a good brush from a bad one. So let&#x27;s go through my list of CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They smell --even though I have washed them a couple times now, I still can&#x27;t shake that \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; smell... *shrugs*&lt;br /&gt;2. The hairs fall out so easily (especially the face brushes) --after I&#x27;m done putting on my makeup I&#x27;ll have to... brush?...the brush hairs off my face! It&#x27;s so bad that I could probably put a fake mustache together.&lt;br /&gt;3. The brushes are not soft at all --I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and washed them with that baby shampoo, but after that it just smelled like a wet, plastic, baby (not good!).. OH! and I also straightened the face brushes with my straightener.. did not really make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, okay, if you&#x27;re just beginning to get into makeup (which is, let me warn you, ADDICTING!) then this MIGHT be something you can practice with. But if I could give you some advice... go to target and get the Sonia Kashuk brush set for like $20, it&#x27;s a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I feel less than dumb for buying this set, but what am I gonna do? I don&#x27;t want to return it because I do like ONE brush, haha. the part that made me buy it is: #1 the price (34 brushes for $32 is a pretty good deal) and #2 it was so convenient that all these different brushes came in one little package. By the way, be careful with the big, fat fan brush --the color bleeds... A LOT and the little skinny baby one is pointless because it&#x27;s made up of like 8 tiny hairs that fall out anyway. Oh, and why would someone need like 10 concealer brushes? weird. Umm.. so yeah, I hope my review helped at least one person...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my looong review! :)</li>
    <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t expect much when I purchased this product.  THe brushes aren&#x27;t great quality, I really just wanted the leather case. :)  Some of the eye brushes work really well.  This brush set is better suited for a make-up \\&quot;novice\\&quot; that needs decent brushes to practice and learn with.  I will say I use these brushes when I travel that way I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing one of my good ones.</li>
    <li> I just love, love, love my brushes!  I have more than enough brushes to do what I need to do when doing my make-up applications.  My girlfriend, who&#x27;s a MAC girl was jealous because I have an array of brushes for the price she paid for 2 of her MAC brushes.  Now she wants to use mine.... NOPE!  I&#x27;ll get her a set for Christmas perhaps.  Thank you Amazon &amp; Bundle Monster for this great deal!  I&#x27;m HAPPY!!!!</li>
    <li> When i got this product i didn&#x27;t know what to expect, since it&#x27;s really cheap i was expecting a terrible brush set but since i needed brushes to travel i decide to risk my money into this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say i&#x27;m glad i got it, the face brushes are the best, the eye shadow brushes are really soft as well but the only problem is that there&#x27;s like 3 brushes that look and do exact the same thing, so i think they need more variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only brush that i hate is the small fan brush, DON&#x27;T WASH IT, BECAUSE IT WILL LOOK HORRIBLE&lt;br /&gt;My favorite brush  is the big fan brush and my boyfriend michael call it pepe-le-pew, that brush is the softer from all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET IT YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lOVE YESSY.BAKER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE A MAKEUP CHANNEL AND I WILL BE DOING A REVIEW IN THIS BRUSHES IN A DAY OR TWO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[…]</li>
    <li> i got this brush set for Christmas this year and i love them i read all the reviews and everything and as for mine they do not smell they are soft there is some loose hairs but so does expensive brushes and like someone wrote u get what u pay for that is right but i think what u pay for it and how many u get is amazing i love them all and i would recommended anyone pro or beginner to use these 100% i just love them!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very nice and the case is nice as well.  However my case came damaged as one of the ties was not actually stitched so when I opened them the first time, one came off and I can not tie them anymore, I have to wrap them.  Other than the case the brushes are pretty nice.  Not as soft as I was expecting, but still nice.</li>
    <li> I have not used the brushes yet but they seem to be great. They are pretty soft (not the softest)But the bristles were all bent and frazzeled after shipping. You may have to wash them and dry them to get there shape back. You get alot of brushes for a great price. They came in way earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;v been eying this brush-set for months however I was quite skeptical. Finally I decided to purchase, packaging came ok.  Now i wanted to test each brush out. Some of the brushed when I took them out were very dusty and the brush part started coming out. Was not impressed after spending my money on this. Hope it doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone else!</li>
    <li> I was excited to find a low budget set of brushes but when i received this item I wanted to throw up THE SMELL IS HORRIBLE I HAD TO RETURN IT MEAN WHILE I HAD TO PUT THIS ITEM INTO 2PLASTIC BAGS BECAUSE IT SMELLED SO HORRIBLE PPL SAVE UR MONEY</li>
    <li> It is huge, lots of brushes that i really dont know what are they for. Its ok, the quality is just ok, nothing too fancy or glamourus</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that I have used everything from top of the line brushes to generic brushes. The price of this brush set is about the average cost of a single brush that I usually purchase.     The brush set arrived 4 days after I purchased it which was a big plus for me. I opened the package and was surprised at how big the set actually was. Since I am a poor college student, I know I have to make these brushes last since I no longer can splurge on a powder brush. I took off the plastic wrap and I could smell the vinyl 20 feet away. Big minus since it made the brushes smell funny.  (I HIGHLY doubt that the make-up roll is leather) Each brush comes individually wrapped which was another plus for me. I took off each wrapper and that&#x27;s when I got disappointed. Some of the brushes were fine, but others just looked pathetic. The bristles we&#x27;re all over the place and super stringy. The small fan brush made me want to cry a little. The hair on the brush looked like the hair of a cheap hooker who had just been gang banged for a few hours. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it was salvageable. Even though I was bummed, I continued to unwrap each brush and wash EVERY BRUSH in warm water. I suggest everyone do that because the brushes do bleed, especially the large black fan brush. I used warm water and an olive oil shampoo. I laid them all flat and let them dry over night on a towel. I woke up in the morning and some of the brushes still looked pretty bad. *Almost all of the concealer brushes looked pretty good, I&#x27;m taking about the hair brushes such as the shadow brushes and powder brushes* As for softness, it wasn&#x27;t that great either. I still couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make stray away hairs stay put.    After much googling, I came across this miracle product called Mona Lisa Brush Shaper ([...]) and I decided to go to Hobby Lobby and try it out. You can find the stuff in the painting aisles, and yes it is safe to use the brushes afterwards. The brush shaper does not irritate even the most sensitive of skins like mine. I laid the brushes out and re washed them (this time using Johnson Baby Shampoo) and let them dry again over night. The next day (day 3), I used the brush shaper. You can youtube how to use it. After I finished shaping them all, I let them dry again over night. *The only brush I did not shape was the large fan brush, but make sure you wash it at least twice because I does bleed a lot) On day 4 the brushes looked fantastic and felt so soft after I played with the bristles a bit except for the 4 largest brushes (minus the large fan brush). The brush shaper helped but didn&#x27;t work miracles on the larger brushes. I washed the 4 largest brushes again and let them dry over night. On day 5 I called one of my friends who works at M.A.C and she helped me out a bit. When they dry completely *and I mean COMPLETELY* turn on a flat iron to about half way and go over the brushes a few times. This will only work if you have the plastic brush cover that came on the brushes. *Only the big powder brushes came with it which is perfect* While the brushes are still warm, put the cover back on the brush. Do this for the Large, Medium and Small powder brush and the contour brush. After I let the brushes stay like that over night, they were shaped pretty darn good and the constant washing and heat left the brushes SOOOOOOO SOFT!    I know it sounds like I went through hell and back to get this brush set to work but at $32, come on. If you&#x27;re willing to put in some elbow grease and make these brushes work for you, I can promise you they will last a pretty decent time if you take care of them. Think of these brushes as Egyptian cotton sheets ... the more you wash and work them, the softer they get :]      ***Just some end notes***    -Over all, I would suggest this set to a friend who I know would take the time to get them to their potential or a person who just doesn&#x27;t care about make-up brushes.    -The case DOES smell. I took out all of my brushes, rubbed it down with Alcohol and let it air out will and continue airing it out until the smell goes away, which it almost has.     -Down side is that there is no large foundation brush        Hope my review helped out!</li>
    <li> For what I paid for these brushes I&#x27;m pleased...Granted I washed them in some gentile soup and extra virgin olive oil to make them clean and conditioned them, the fraying that happens when you get the brush went away and I haven&#x27;t had a problem! I dont know how I feel about he sponge applicators those could have been left out to tell you the truth the entire idea of buying a brush roll is to get away from those awful things! it dose have a weird smell but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me after airing it out and after a long usage it should be fine. all and out i would say its great for the price your getting pretty okay brushes for a really good price!</li>
    <li> This is a good value for the brush set but the quality is a little poor...I recently used the larger brushes on a wedding party and they all had brush hairs left on their face from the brushes shedding but the smaller brushes work well. Good for practice but not professional use.</li>
    <li> These were a gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> The case DOES NOT SMELL like othe reviews claim but the brushes DO shed. Just follow the instrustions a person left on here and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be good. I gave it 4 stars only because everytime I order anything from Amazon or it&#x27;s sellers I get the items 2-3 after I order them but with this seller it took 1-2 longer, I still got it before the due date but I&#x27;m use the super speedy delivery. Other than that it&#x27;s a good product. Not the greatest but you get what you pay for I always say and I am a newbie with makeup so I did not want to spend to much on practice brushes.</li>
    <li> Price is affordable, quality i would say isnt what i expected. The bigger brushes the bristles fall out and while applying makeup the hairs get all over your face, but the smaller eyeshadow brushes are great. Love the smaller brushes, got rid of the bigger ones.</li>
    <li> So many great brushes and in a  really nice carrying case. Thank you for having this for such a great price and sending so quickly.</li>
    <li> These brushes shed badly.  I&#x27;ve tried to de-shed them, but nothing I do helps.  This is a really nice looking set of brushes that make your face look HAIRY!</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes because I wanted to have a variety of brushes to apply my eyeshadow! I am a make-up geek so I buy a lot of items and this was a grat purchase! My brushes work well, even though I only used two of them today! But I like the quality, not in love with them, but for $32 I will never complain! The case does give off a weird smell, therefore I would question whether the case is real leather! But I am impressed with them and I really will be using them a lot! For the price and the amount, this would be a great buy!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. Description is very accurate.Shipping was a little long but would definately recommend. Brushes are soft but not too soft works well when applying my makeup</li>
    <li> I got it on time, it&#x27;s very nice. I got is as a present for my sister for Christmas (early, obviously). The brushes are beautiful, I can&#x27;t wait for her to see them.</li>
    <li> the brushes were GREAT!!! my friend and i bought them together and split them all the brushes are good quality and they are very soft.the only down side is theres lotssss of eye brushes and a lot of them are the same...it would be much better if there were more face brushes</li>
    <li> Come on. This brush set&#x27;s really cheap. What do you expect?     I can&#x27;t really use the big brushes since as everyone mentioned, the hair falls out and the quality isn&#x27;t so great.     however, I like the eyeshadow brushes and the smaller brushes.     I&#x27;m happy just to have so many brushes.     If you are looking for very good quality brushes, look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> the product looked and souned promising, but upond recieving them they did not look as good as they made them sound. Also, when I started using them, they fell apart easily!!! Do not buy this product unless you want hairs from the brushes all over your face and make up!</li>
    <li> HAVE A VARIETY OF BRUSHES ARE VERY SOFT AND EASY TO RECOMMEND THE APPLICATION, ESPECIALLY THE CARRY IN YOUR BAG CAN NOT WEIGH ANYTHING, EVEN SOME OF FALLING HAIR</li>
    <li> okay so for the past 8 months i have been hunting for brushes. When i came across this product i got exited and nervous i mean 34 brushes and case? i thought it was too good to be true. Let me just say it is a great buy if you are willing to put forward the work to get these brushes in the best shape ever. I took the advice of a previous buyer that laid out a \\&quot;step by step\\&quot; way to get these brushes pretty near to perfection. I am thrilled and can not wait to keep on playing with my new tools!! it is a MUST buy. The only downfall is the awful stench the pleather (its not a leather) case. It is an easy fix all you have to do is wipe it down with rubbing alcohol. ENJOY!</li>
    <li> Recieved this product 4 days after ordering it. For the price the brushes are great. You need to know how to clean and prepare bushes. The handles are long and the brushes come in all sizes make sure to wash them before using as they will shed. These brushes are not quite as good as mac or bobby brown etc. but they are worth every penny. I will buy from seller again. The only thing wrong was the eyebrow brush. it was smashed and there isnt really a way to re set that one. i have a mac brush so that doesnt really matter. everything else looks great. happy with my buy.</li>
    <li> you get what u pay for right? these brushes SUCK ive had them for a year and they DO NOT LAST! and theyre ugly and not soft at all! D:</li>
    <li> I was surprised at the quality for the price of these brushes.  They are tethered well at the ends and do not shed.  They are tightly bound in their ends and apply powders and blushes excellently.</li>
    <li> These brushes are not the best quality but they are usable.   I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them if I was able to see the quality.   If u are looking for high end brushes these are not for u. If u are looking for  Something temporary these r okay but I suggest u save the money towards good brushes. Or   By from coastalscents.com</li>
    <li> Al principio no podia creer la cantidad de pinceles que trae este estuche, es maravilloso y la suavidad es genial sientes como si fueran plumas super suaves.</li>
    <li> The brushes came in a great roll up case. The amount of brushes for the cost was an excellent buy. The big blush brushes were a bit rough. I don&#x27;t use them very much, but it&#x27;s a great starter kit for applying makeup.</li>
    <li> I believe you should always get good quality brushes. Cheap brushes just do not get the job done. These were the cheapest brushes I have ever bought. They lasted me about a month and then started to fall apart. I hated using them because they were so rough.</li>
    <li> What a great selection of powder brushes.  I began using this set of brushes, and I am pleased that it allows smooth application of powder before my moisturizer.  It spreads well and evenly for full coverage.  The bristles are soft, smooth, and comfortable!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received this today I opened it and was so disappointed. The brushes looked horrible and had major fallout. The bristles were extremely rough. $31.99 was definitely not Worth it. I just received them and I am sending them Back. DON&#x27;T buy. I guess I will invest in some sigma and Mac brushes.</li>
    <li> I love doing my make-up, and this was my first starter bundle of brushes. IT&#x27;S PERFECT TO EXPERIMENT WITH! I did however have to glue one piece together, but it was no big deal. For $30-35 bucks its a must.</li>
    <li> Love it a very good selection. Sooo recommend. You can do lots of neat designs I&#x27;m totally pleaded with this purchase</li>
    <li> Two things; 1) the case smell strange  2)The Sponge tip applicator came right off, other then that I am very happy with the set..</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my sister and she loves them! She uses them all the time and brags about how much she likes them.</li>
    <li> i was excited when i received it but when i opened it up it&#x27;s not soft that i don&#x27;t like and i haven&#x27;t even used it...:(</li>
    <li> So I have owned this brush set for almost 4 years. WHen i purchased these brushes I was a beginner and wanted to get practice before buying a more expensive set. I would say this is a good gift for a beginner, or someone who does not use makeup often. The brushes shed ALOT, it is very poorly made as the heads come off often, I used glue to keep them on. I would not use these brushes with liquid makeup. I would not repurchase this product for myself, but I would give as a gift to a teenager or adult just learning how use makeup and they are not sure if they will wear makeup daily.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 3 times for friends. It is a great product, great brushes! if you take care of them and clean them correctly you would have no problem with the bristles falling out. I have been doing makeup for 9 years now and these were great for the price! &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT BUY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the ONLY con is that some of the head fall off but that can be fixed with some glue! ;-)</li>
    <li> I had purchased another set of makeup brushes from another site in the past. While they were a good product, I didn&#x27;t find as much as a variety as I found on Amazon.com. There are twice the amount of brushes in what I purchased from Amazon then the other site. Thank you and keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> I liked the product very much, brushes are of a very high quality and quite cheap for it. I&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
    <li> In the beginning the brushed shed just alittle but after using it a couple of times it stopped and too many brushes that look alike and have the same function.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a big bundle I thought it would be more than your average brush set but this was more way more. The package came on time and well packaged non were damaged and there was no smell well worth the money . Great brushed for the cheap price.</li>
    <li> So disapointed with the bundle monster 34 pc studio pro makeup brush set...horrible quality! the hair fall off with every use and not to mention they smell horrible also the leather case looks so cheap...do not buy it isnt worth the money.</li>
    <li> the brushes arrived quickly. i was happy about that. the case smells! some brushes shed really bad, and some brushes look the exact same as others...</li>
    <li> Dislike the brushes 100%, when I was using then the lil hairs idk what u want to call it would fall off one by one</li>
    <li> My daughter loved her brushes.  She wanted something with lots of options and this was perfect.  Everything was there expecept one of the brushes she wanted so that was a downside, but other than that she is happy with her gift</li>
    <li> they has a good vareaty of sizes , you can use them in many ways an has a good price</li>
    <li> The price is great but the brushes are horrible. I can&#x27;t stand the smell. I don&#x27;t even use the leather case.</li>
    <li> This kit is a great starter brush set for beginners! I still love my brushes from smashbox and mac, but if you&#x27;re looking for a complete set that will hold up and do the job, this is it.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, but the brushes are kind of rough, they&#x27;re not all soft like most brushes, also the glue isn&#x27;t that strong so the brushes fall off the stick. The case is really nice though, it looks professional.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews, and still decided on this product. i got it fast, and it doesn&#x27;t stink like plastic terribly. the brushes don&#x27;t shed, nor bleed. they work great, and came in brand new condition. would buy again.</li>
    <li> I gotta tell ya....I definitely was not expecting THIS many make up brushes. I think it is definitely worth what I paid. The leather case is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> This is one of the Best things that i have every purchased!   I never was into makeup until recently and i need brushes for all my new eye shadows that i bought. I came on Amazon to find ok quality brushes but really cheap. Because at Sephora or MAC they are each like $30 that ridiculous to me and i cant afford somthing like that. Well i found this bundler monster and these are truly amazing! I love every single brush in this kit. They are very good quality all of them are Very soft! The only small problem that i thought would turn into a bigger proplem well 1 of the brushes started to shed when i was using it so i pulled the loose ones out but it just kept shedding it. Im telling you the Truth it did shed for awhile just me pulling the brissles out. BUT when i did this after it stopped it didnt loose all of them. They are wonderful that was the only 1 that did shed and it stopped and hasnt done that since. THis is the BEst thing every if your going to buy cheap brushes buy these they are wonderful! cant get over how much i love these!</li>
    <li> I bought the brushes about a month ago. When i first used them i noticed they weren&#x27;t very soft and also after deep cleaning them for the first time the hairs started falling off. So i had to get rid of a couple that i couldn&#x27;t use anymore. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again its a waste of money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not allowing me to do a half star..m I was not impressed</li>
    <li> Great bundle for a good price. My daughter loves it. Good seller.</li>
    <li> I received my product in a timely time frame. IT was nice conducting business with you the service was great</li>
    <li> the price is great for 34pcs and the brushes seem bigger than the pictures. the only thing that made me take out one star is that some of the brushes where not shaped right or the hairs where messy looking. the sponge brushes easily come off, but I dont use sponge anyways. i was missing a shadow brush, but got an extra concealer brush.</li>
    <li> awsome price but after a few weeks  noticed the brushes started to shed a lil i had brush hairs on my shin after application,spedially foundation a lil whip and it was cool god deal 4 the price tho!:-)</li>
    <li> I LIKE THE FACT THAT I CAN GET A LOT OF BRUSHES FOR THE PRICE. HOWEVER, THE ROLL BAG HAD A HORRIBLE!!!!!! SMELL, I DO NOT USE THE BAG AT ALL! THE HAIRS DO SHED AT TIMES ON THE LARGE AND SMALL BRUSHES, ESPECIALLY NOTICED AFTER I FIRST WASHED THE BRUSHES. I WISH THE BRUSHES WERE LABELED WITH NUMBERS OR WORDS AS EXPENSIVE BRUSHES ARE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STARTER BRUSH SET, THEN THIS SET IS OK, BUT FOR A PROFESSIONAL BRUSH SET, THIS IS NOT THE SET TO USE. I STILL USE THE BRUSHES, AS I HAVE NOW HAD THE BRUSHES FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, THEY SEEM TO LAST, IN BETWEEN SHEDDING HAIRS. THE BRISLES ARE SOFT, AND THE BRUSHES ARE GOOD FOR TRAVEL.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie. I bought them because I thought for the price it would be really cool. I was impulsive. Anyways, I really didn&#x27;t need any more brushes considering that I definitely have enough. Anyways, unless your a make-up artist, it is a huge waste. When are you really going to use every single one of these brushes when a lot of them are practically the same? The quality is alright. They aren&#x27;t really that soft. The smaller ones are just a waste, but the larger ones are alright. I have had them since December and I have never used them. I thought I would for travel, but I still haven&#x27;t. Eco Tools is a little more expensive, but still SUPER cheap and much better. I have had my LARGE powder brush for two years. I bought it for $7.99 and it is still just as soft. I used their eyeshadow brushes too. They are the softest brushes I have ever used including the ones from Chanel and MAC. I just recently bought a brush set from Eco Tools for $15 that included a nice case that you can put other make-up in too and about 6 or 7 brushes. Not only is the quality much better, but also you will actually use them all unlike this set.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I had great customer service and the product was shipped fast. But unfortunately you get what you pay for. The brushes and case smelled deadly, even after washing them. The bristles are very scratchy against the skin, and the heads of the brushes kept falling off. You do get a lot of product for your money, but if you want nice quality brushes without spending a lot of money I would recommend the Studio Elf Brushes (about $3.00 each), they&#x27;re very soft and apply makeup very well.</li>
    <li> From buying these make up brushes I learned that it&#x27;s quality and not quantity when choosing brushes. I loved the roll that the brushes came in online, but it&#x27;s cheap and ugly in person. The only two brushes I really appreciate in this roll are the two fan brushes. The rest are stiff, itchy, many are very similar to one another. The only positive that I can say is I have had problems with bristles falling out. I find myself really only using these brushes when my others need cleaning and I putting make up on somebody else. The brushes I do use every day are EcoTools. They are soft and wonderful!</li>
    <li> Okay, save your money and buy your brushes at the dollar store.  I have had these for about a year (but not used every day, only maybe 20 times) and 5 of them have fallen apart, they are bent, and the hair falls out. I have a firm grip when I use my brushes and it actually bends the brushes. They are not made of wood, or even plastic. I don&#x27;t even know what they are made out of. The brushes are incredibly rough, and they give minimum coverage. It&#x27;s also lacking all kinds of brushes that are essential. For example, there are no foundation and concealer brushes, no kabouki equivalent, no stippling brush, no stiff pencil brush, and no smudgers. It has way too many face brushes and way too many lip brushes. The only ones that aren&#x27;t falling apart are the ones I never use. However, the black fluffy face brush is excellent for brushing eraser bits off of my artwork, so bonus points for that. After one cleaning, the brushes were ruined, and now I have to spend money on brushes again, when I thought this would last me. As a college student who is on financial aid, I can&#x27;t afford to buy high end brushes, but I wouldn&#x27;t give these to a homeless person to use. Try e.l.f brushes instead, same value, better quality.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. But are very long. Got here lil late.</li>
    <li> Very useful I&#x27;m a makeup artist</li>
    <li> Bristle fall out with every use. Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> awesome product! very professional</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush set because I needed a few different brushes for various make up effects. I was mainly interested in the eye brushes as I already have a few face brushes from Sephora. Since the price per brush in this set is less than $1, I was not expecting super high quality. I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the brushes are very good, especially for how cheap this set is. I found the face brushes a little coarse and they do shed, however that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for high quality brushes, expect to spend $30-$70 per brush. This is a good starting out set but is in no way a replacement for salon quality brushes. If you need lots of brushes fast, get this.</li>
    <li> These are great and have lasted a long time. I don&#x27;t use the leather wrap, and have needed a super glue a few of the brushes to the handles, but that&#x27;s probably due to the way I clean the bristles. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> This was a great bargain and find.  Would re-purchase this.</li>
    <li> Was a Christmas gift, no complaints yet.</li>
    <li> I got the bag for my sister and as she said and from what I saw she LOVED IT SO MUCH!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing... however for a first time buyer or someone just getting started the brushes could get confusing for them. there is no label on them telling you which is which. and the fact that you have multiples of the same brush could get very confusing</li>
    <li> great starter set for anyone new to make up. however the brushes heads shed  and need to be trimmed prior to use. also, the handles detached/ paint peeled after 2 - 3 brush washes (only soaked to about 1/2 way to the metal connector). I would still recommend this set because it&#x27;s a great deal and great for practice. once you get better at make up then I&#x27;d definitely upgrade to a professional set.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a gift. I was soo in love when i first saw it but it became more and more disapointing. The brush hair falls out which sucks. The brushes dont have a lot of direrent kinds like its the same one in a different size. I wash my brushes and theses did not come out good at all. it is ok for a person just starting makeup for the amount of money but i want to get new ones. :&#x27;(</li>
    <li> I received the brushes in record time, but to my dismay, the brushes are very harsh feeling. I cant imagine using these harsh brushes on someones face. In my opinion they are not a professional product and I feel as if I waisted my money.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive way to learn what all the brushes are for and how to use them.  The brushes aren&#x27;t great quality, but it doesn&#x27;t matter.  Anyone learning the art of applying makeup is a lot eaiser when you know how to use the correct tools.</li>
    <li> Good product and nice seller.</li>
    <li> i bought these brushes with the intentions of having a good variety of brushes for my makeup that would do a decent job. I was so disappointed. They fell apart. The hairs fell out all the time. The handles broke to pieces. They don&#x27;t pick up pigment that well at all. I honestly think these should sell for about $15. At that price I guess I wouldn&#x27;t complain. But I would not recommend these to anyone. I was highly disappointed.</li>
    <li> This set is simply amazing. I love the selection of brushes available to me now and have become spoiled having such a selection! The only \\&quot;Negative\\&quot; I would have is that its extremely bulky. The picture of course makes it look like it is compact. I put all the brushes in a glass candle holder with coffee beans to keep them upright and only use the case for traveling! I can promise you will love this set though!</li>
    <li> This brush set is the BOMB!!  It has every brush you can imagine and I love it!  Good quality and love the leather carrying case.</li>
    <li> really good brush i have had them for 9 months and the brushs are in good  shape they feel good on face they dont feel weird like other brushs you pick up the eyeshadow alot i wll get is again</li>
    <li> The quality was not that great.. kind of on the imitation side.  There was a great selection but missing the natural feel.</li>
    <li> they break apart soon seemed to be glued aparty poorly. two came already broken. save your money and get something else</li>
    <li> These brushes go for twice the price at the store. The brushes are great and look like they are worth much more!</li>
    <li> excellent quality and timely delivery</li>
    <li> I bought two sets of brushes for me and my sister. Both arrived in perfect condition, promptly and without any problem.&lt;br /&gt;During the first days the brushes do shed a lot of hair but they are still buff and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very good quality for this price.</li>
    <li> I looked all over for a nice brush set, I found this Bundle and was excited. When the product arrived, it already had loose bristles. Save your money. Cleaning them only makes matters worse.</li>
    <li> They may look nice but don’t be fooled. They are not soft in fact they are stiff and itchy, and they shed, the bristle fall out all over your face.</li>
    <li> I expected the brushed to at least be somewhat or a better quality. I ended up giving them away because they were so bad. It seems like a good deal, but the bristles were falling out after I used them once. Next time I will go to Sephora.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely low quality. The hairs fall out of the brushes extremely easily and on the first day that I used one of the brushes, it fell off of the stick (wasn&#x27;t glued on well) mid-use.  This is an inexpensive item because the quality is extremely poor.  I would save your money to buy brushes one at a time instead of buying this junk.</li>
    <li> It is nice having different sizes of brushes but for some there is no difference. Not great quality brushes. The hair falls out and the tips of the brushes come off the handles. If you want good quality I would recommend spending a little more for good brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought these quite a while ago, I use them every day.  The quality isn&#x27;t exactly the greatest.... the metal tips that hold the brushes onto the wood handles have come off on several of the smaller brushes.  I&#x27;ve had to glue them back together.  But that&#x27;s fairly easy.  I think I just enjoy having such a wide variety of brushes at my disposal.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend does not have any complaints, would order from them again and would recommend this to my family &amp; friends. Also, she was surprised how cheap they were and how many there was for that price! Thank you again for everything!</li>
    <li> I was trying to save a bit of money by buying this however the hair they used for the brushes absolutely sucks and falls out so easily.</li>
    <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be given to anybody a gift! The brushes look used. I kept mine because of the price I paid for 34 brushes. I can live!</li>
    <li> The hair just falls out of these brushes</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a nice set, don&#x27;t get my wrong.  However, one of the brushes came broken, and I was disappointed because it&#x27;s one of the more important brushes!  Oh well though, I paid $30.99+shipping. The brush is a 34 piece kit, so even at $1 for each brush, I still got a DAMN GOOD DEAL!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves them.  Her older sister has some more expensive...higher quality brushes and she said she these were not too bad but still prefers her more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> It is ok for the price, not as good as I thought because the big brushes keep loosing hair which stays on your face!!!</li>
    <li> just the thing to start a makeup trunk with and it was just as it was said to be. love the long handels on each brush.</li>
    <li> Really liked the case and the wide variety of brushes. Brushes also seemed to be of good quality. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> If you like to have a lot of brushes it is a good product. However I never needed THIS MANY brushes. Tbh I have no idea what I was thinking. I did like the selection of eye brushes though. They tend to fall apart overtime. And the bristles fell out since the beginning. After a year I had to glue the base to the handle because it fell off. They&#x27;re good for the price. But you&#x27;re better off investing in decent brushes</li>
