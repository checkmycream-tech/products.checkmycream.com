      <li>I love the Broncos Headband</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute and comfortable</li>
      <li>It has a smooth inside...doesn&#x27;t hurt my head after wearing all day.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
      <li>Is very flexible, and doesn&#x27;t squeeze my head.</li>
      <li>obviously meant for a child, luckily I knew one to give this to</li>
      <li>The seller got back to me right away with the answers to the questions I had, and the shipping was fast, on time.</li>
      <li>I bought a few of these for some of the younger girls in my family for Christmas and they really liked them.</li>
      <li>Although the headband itself was super cute, it was terribly uncomfortable and put pressure on my temples.</li>
      <li>Very well made and has a suede-like inner lining, which was an added plus.</li>
      <li>The bronco on the headband we received is near the end of the headband.  </li>
      <li>but I wish it had been made clear prior to purchasing</li>
      <li>Very soft, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my head if left on for too long.</li>

<li> Sadly, won&#x27;t wear it another time! :(</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed with the seller or their products!</li>

    <li> The bronco on the headband we received is near the end of the headband.  I think it is just luck of the draw.  My wife said it was a bit tight but, admittedly, her head is not small.</li>
    <li> Very well made and has a suede-like inner lining, which was an added plus. I purchased this at the beginning of December and have had a lot of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> 4 granddaughters love them!</li>
    <li> Love love love this! It&#x27;s cute and comfortable</li>
    <li> This is the best head band I have ever had! Very soft, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my head if left on for too long. Is very flexible, and doesn&#x27;t squeeze my head. The seller got back to me right away with the answers to the questions I had, and the shipping was fast, on time. I would definitely recommend the product to anyone! You will not be disappointed with the seller or their products! Very Awesome!</li>
    <li> Although the headband itself was super cute, it was terribly uncomfortable and put pressure on my temples. I had to take it off multiple times during the one day I wore it. Even tried placing cardboard as a buffer, the only thing I could find at work, but it didn&#x27;t relieve the pressure. Sadly, won&#x27;t wear it another time! :(</li>
