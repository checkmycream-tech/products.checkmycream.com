      <li>I am able to do my nails on my own using this light to cure them.</li>
      <li>use the Gelish polishes and love love love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this product is def not made for constant salon use, it works best for once in a while at home.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for making swatch sticks of my UV Gel polishes, many manicures, and even for decorating a cell phone case without any problems.</li>
      <li>Love this thing.</li>
      <li>ANY MORE</li>
      <li>In my country and in most countries I know the supplied electricity is 220v.</li>
      <li>I do think that you need a bit more time drying</li>
      <li>then it says, but overall it does a great job!  </li>
      <li>At first I plugged in all the bulbs &amp; it didn&#x27;t work at all!!!</li>
      <li>The light bulbs come out very easily.</li>
      <li>So, this is good for a first uv lamp.</li>
      <li>It works great so far!</li>
      <li>I did a lot of research and made sure I am using the light correctly before I judged the product.</li>
      <li>Cures polish nicely and doesn&#x27;t run hot.</li>
      <li>but the light does work well.</li>
      <li>so thats a plus but its cheaply made but what can we except for 30 dollar uv lamp</li>
      <li>This light was one of the cheaper ones</li>
      <li>you get what you pay for its cheap plastic and one of the bulbs doesnt even work...</li>
      <li>With a curing light like this, you can get all you need for the cost of two gel manicures in a salon.</li>
      <li>It takes a bit of practice to get skilled at it, but It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Love the quality, love the black, love the lights it comes with, love the timer!</li>
      <li>You are able to fit one whole hand under the light with a timer.</li>
      <li>I definitely have enjoyed the savings from doing my own Gel Nails.  </li>
      <li>Its great shape, takes longer to dry the shellac, and gels</li>
      <li>It does get the job done and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
      <li>Havent had any problems since :) Its not a heavy duty light, is a bit flimsy but its cures my nails</li>
      <li>I like that the bulbs are angled, so the thumb and pinky cure much better than if the bulbs are only across the top.</li>
      <li>Really Like the lamp works well, but the light bulbs dont fit</li>
      <li>it is very time consuming when you do it yourself!!</li>
      <li>really like this light.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s way better than the old one I had.</li>
      <li>This lamp is definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Was skeptical at first but the light work great!</li>
      <li>but still it doesn&#x27;t feel like I bought the new item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the quick shipping though!</li>
      <li>Straightforward, easy to use, seems like it will last quite some</li>
      <li>My friend suggested to get a lamp with buttons on top instead in the back like this one has</li>
      <li>Not expensive</li>
      <li>The plug is not sturdy, so when I plug it in it can easily unplug itself and the cord is pretty short.</li>
      <li>However, this lamp does not seem to be built very sturdy and is nothing special as far as design</li>
      <li>I orderd this for my wife we recived it FAST</li>
      <li>simple, the light works as instructed.</li>
      <li>I was very worried about whether or not this UV lamp would be sufficient to cure my Shellac and Gelish polish.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s holding up very well.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>it does seem like it will get warm enough to dry nails</li>
      <li>Sometimes I have to cure them for like 6 minutes or more each coat if I&#x27;m doing a dark color</li>
      <li>well they are loose, and the build seems cheap</li>
      <li>a little flimsy but have enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>Its great to practice with but in the future will need something a little faster later on</li>
      <li>Had this lamp since February 2014 as of may 21 two of the bulbs quit working replaced with new ones sockets</li>
      <li>the light bulbs work instantly and perfectly despite all the other bad reviews about that area.</li>
      <li>seems a little flimsy but it cures my nails just fine</li>
      <li>The bulbs refused to light at first, after switching them around when they did eventually light they all just keep cutting of every 10Sec...</li>
      <li>I have only used it a couple of times but so far nothing has broken and everything came in good condition.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually use timer, so it is fine</li>
      <li>Product was exactly what I was expecting and nothing less!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I have not fully used it. I have only used it a couple of times but so far nothing has broken and everything came in good condition. I got the black one like in the picture. If I had to think of one thing I did not like it would be the extension cord. The plug is not sturdy, so when I plug it in it can easily unplug itself and the cord is pretty short. I would day maybe 24 inches.</li>
    <li> I have had this for 4 months, I have used it every 2-3 weeks since purchasing it. It is great! Straightforward, easy to use, seems like it will last quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Gelish polishes and love love love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your gel manicures at home! With a curing light like this, you can get all you need for the cost of two gel manicures in a salon.</li>
    <li> All the bulbs on mine work, but it takes a while to cure my colored gel nails. Sometimes I have to cure them for like 6 minutes or more each coat if I&#x27;m doing a dark color (and I apply thin layers)! The timer does not work on my light.&lt;br /&gt;This product is good for the cost though. It does get the job done and that&#x27;s good enough for me. I would suggest this for those just starting out on gel manicures. I would not invest a lot of money if you are a beginner because you might get sick of doing your own gels (like I did)- it is very time consuming when you do it yourself!! So, this is good for a first uv lamp. Mine has been working for a few months now.</li>
    <li> This light was one of the cheaper ones and so it made me nervous getting it... But when I got it I LOVED IT! Love the quality, love the black, love the lights it comes with, love the timer! My mom and sister are getting the same one now! (:</li>
    <li> simple, the light works as instructed. You are able to fit one whole hand under the light with a timer. PEEL OFF BLUE FILM! no instructions were included for that part but it makes ALL the difference in the drying results! I did a lot of research and made sure I am using the light correctly before I judged the product. the light bulbs work instantly and perfectly despite all the other bad reviews about that area. It has got to be the cheapest, BEST working  UV light on the market so far.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical at first but the light work great! At first I plugged in all the bulbs &amp; it didn&#x27;t work at all!!! I was quite frustrated but after letting it sit for about half hour and calming myself down I went back to play around with it and it work as soon as I plugged it in.  It cures my gels awesome! Havent had any problems since :) Its not a heavy duty light, is a bit flimsy but its cures my nails so I am happy with that.  Great price for the light :)</li>
    <li> I orderd this for my wife we recived it FAST so thats a plus but its cheaply made but what can we except for 30 dollar uv lamp you get what you pay for its cheap plastic and one of the bulbs doesnt even work... it does seem like it will get warm enough to dry nails so we will see.. not sure what ealse to say</li>
    <li> The appearance of the item was satifactory but the item is inferior.The bulbs refused to light at first, after switching them around when they did eventually light they all just keep cutting of every 10Sec...This was so inconveniencing &amp; disappointing...</li>
    <li> really like this light.  I have used it 8 times and it has done what is has suppose to do. a little flimsy but have enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> Bought this lamp because I do my own gel nails at home and this is perfect! Not expensive it&#x27;s enough for home use. You shouldn&#x27;t go with anything less then 36w even for personal use. My friend suggested to get a lamp with buttons on top instead in the back like this one has but I personally do not mind having the buttons in the back</li>
    <li> The shipping was quick and the lamp works wonderfully. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good UV lamp.</li>
    <li> Had this lamp since February 2014 as of may 21 two of the bulbs quit working replaced with new ones sockets no longer work what a hunk of junk! wasted my money</li>
    <li> The 120-sec timer does not work for mine.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t usually use timer, so it is fine but still it doesn&#x27;t feel like I bought the new item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the quick shipping though!</li>
    <li> this product is def not made for constant salon use, it works best for once in a while at home. seems a little flimsy but it cures my nails just fine, my at home mani lasted longer than 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> This light is great!  I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times and haven&#x27;t had any problems at all.  As long as you follow all the steps for doing gel nails you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I&#x27;m saving a ton of money by doing them at home and they look amazing!  I&#x27;ve had a few people ask where I get them done.</li>
    <li> The light bulbs come out very easily.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. Saves a ton of money not having to go to the salon. I even use it to polish my toes</li>
    <li> Such a money saver to do this at home instead of at a salon every two weeks</li>
    <li> Lamp was received in excellent condition. Works just as described. I am able to do my nails on my own using this light to cure them. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Its great shape, takes longer to dry the shellac, and gels but it does the job. Its great to practice with but in the future will need something a little faster later on</li>
    <li> I was very worried about whether or not this UV lamp would be sufficient to cure my Shellac and Gelish polish. I have used it 6 times already and it has worked great! It seems to cure everything perfectly without any additional time, the recommended times for the gel systems do just fine. However, this lamp does not seem to be built very sturdy and is nothing special as far as design but it looks sleek and it does the trick. Will it hold up to the test of time though? We shall see :)</li>
    <li> I like the nail lamp.  I do think that you need a bit more time drying then it says, but overall it does a great job!  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Product works and does cure the polish well, but product is poorly made and flimsy, and one light bulb did not work.</li>
    <li> I think that customers should be informed that it works on 110v. It is very important. In my country and in most countries I know the supplied electricity is 220v. Now I have to find and buy adapter too. I should have been informed.</li>
    <li> It works great so far! I only didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars b/c I&#x27;ve only used it twice, and I don&#x27;t know if there will be problems later. I like that the bulbs are angled, so the thumb and pinky cure much better than if the bulbs are only across the top.</li>
    <li> Nice UV lamp for doing gel manicures at home. Cures polish nicely and doesn&#x27;t run hot. I would purchase this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: I&#x27;ve been using this lamp at least once a week for 7 months now and it&#x27;s holding up very well. I&#x27;ve used this for making swatch sticks of my UV Gel polishes, many manicures, and even for decorating a cell phone case without any problems. This lamp is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I THINK THIS LAMP IS NOT THE BEST...... I PURCHASED ALL MY GEL NAILPOLISH AND THE LAMP I WAISTRD MY MONEY I USED THE LAMP 2 TIMES!!!!!!! AND AFTER THAT DIDNT WORK ANY MORE I WAS VERY UNHAPPY.</li>
    <li> I use this to give my friends and myself gel manicures. I really like it. It&#x27;s way better than the old one I had.</li>
    <li> Really Like the lamp works well, but the light bulbs dont fit well they are loose, and the build seems cheap but the light does work well.</li>
    <li> I definitely have enjoyed the savings from doing my own Gel Nails.  It takes a bit of practice to get skilled at it, but It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly what I was expecting and nothing less! I&#x27;ve already used it and I loved it! It worked great with my gel nail polish and I didn&#x27;t have any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulbs were a little hard to put in all the way, but you&#x27;ll know if they&#x27;re 100% once it makes a clicking sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use this to do my nails at home.  I use OPI gel polish and it needs to be cured with light and this light works great.</li>
    <li> An elegant tool for the treatment of dentures and its size and cost were just perfect for our needs. Thank you</li>
