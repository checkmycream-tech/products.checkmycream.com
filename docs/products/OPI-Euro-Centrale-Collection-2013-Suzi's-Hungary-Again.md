      <li>It looks nothing like the pretty coral color shown in the picture, however, it is a pretty pink color.</li>
      <li>Way more pink than I expected.  </li>
      <li>A little lighter than the shade presented but as the bottle was extremely hot from shipping when it arrived, Im not sure whether the lighter color is accurate or due to extremely high temperatures during shipment.  </li>
