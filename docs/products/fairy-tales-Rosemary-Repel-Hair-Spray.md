      <li>Kid hairspray that smells good.</li>
      <li>Smells good, she just sprays in on every morning before school.</li>
      <li>she took one look at the fairy tales bottle and laughed.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love these products!</li>
      <li>i love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love that this is supposed to repel lice!  </li>
      <li>It smells good and holds my daughters fine hair in place!</li>
      <li>besides it smells really nice..</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe two of the reviewers for this product said it smells nice.</li>
      <li>Perfect for my 11 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve had a lot of lice in our community, and my kids have weathered many outbreaks since they&#x27;ve started using the gel and Spray &amp; Shield.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and it works.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my granddaughter and after being nit free and using the spray, the nits returned!</li>
      <li>so far so good!</li>
      <li>This has been an excellent repellant for my preschool aged child..</li>
      <li>surprisingly, this holds really well, too.</li>
      <li>It is too strong, it broke my daughter out severely</li>
      <li>We enjoy the scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;re religious about using both every morning including non-school days (something I was happy about as I watched</li>
      <li>She is now in 5th grade and has been lice free, even when outbreaks have occurred in her school.</li>
      <li>Leave-in conditioner would be better for you if you need your kid to have soft, shiny hair, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective as the gel and Spray &amp; Shield together.</li>
      <li>Cannot say enough good things about them.  </li>
      <li>this would be perfect to at least visit.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and definitely worth the price paid.</li>
      <li>So far we have been without lice for more than a month</li>
      <li>I like this to use as a preventive spray in the mornings since I&#x27;m an elementary teacher.</li>
      <li>I would like to use it more, being the fact so many of family members we avoid due to an ongoing problem and</li>
      <li>I sprayed it on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and then threw it right in the garbage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not just a light lemon-y fragrance, it&#x27;s exactly like those cheap citronella candles you burn outside to keep mosquitoes away.</li>
      <li>at first, i wasn&#x27;t too keen on the smell but, over time, it&#x27;s grown on me.</li>
      <li>Not only does this spray not attract the bugs my daughter says she notices a huge reduction in the number of bugs that buzz around her head when she wears this hair spray.</li>
      <li>It did arrive fast.</li>
      <li>BUT you really need that metal comb.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m getting very nervous</li>
      <li>Love this product, but the cover was not secured before shipping and when it arrived at my house it was only half full.</li>
      <li>but 3/4 of my som&#x27;s class got live and he didn&#x27;t!  </li>
      <li>Cannot live without this product!  </li>
      <li>We found most regular hair sprays actually attract bugs.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products to every parent.</li>
      <li>I would give it 5 stars if it actually helped detangle a little better.</li>
      <li>I like it being all natural, but it is still flammable.</li>
      <li>We have been using this product as per the recommendation of other parents and I have to say we made it through the first year of preschool without any incidences....</li>
      <li>My middle daughter has long, thick, curly hair (think Hermione Granger), but she doesn&#x27;t have a problem brushing the spray out on her own every night.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the only hairspray i&#x27;ll use for my 6 yr old.</li>
      <li>So much for this product warding off the little critters.  </li>

<li> Have not used this very much, because it is very hard to deal with the smell.</li>
<li> Used ever single day and my kids got lice!</li>

<li> I guess that&#x27;s what they mean by shield!</li>
<li> Only disadvantage is the horrible smell..</li>
<li> I ordered this by accident instead of the leave in conditioning spray and this one is horrible for long hair - it was impossible to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair afterward!</li>
<li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!</li>
<li> Worst experience EVER!!!</li>
<li> HATE head lice!  </li>
<li> It is beyond awful.</li>
<li> I will say however, the shampoo and the conditioner do not have this awful smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great best thing on the market for school kids</li>
    <li> So far we have been without lice for more than a month and we use to have a really big problem, and besides it smells really nice..</li>
    <li> I ordered this by accident instead of the leave in conditioning spray and this one is horrible for long hair - it was impossible to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair afterward! We had to wash it out.</li>
    <li> granddaughters use it daily</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these products! My daughter&#x27;s classroom had had two lice incidents and she has not gotten it! We use the shampoo, conditioner &amp; hair spray.</li>
    <li> Awesome preventative!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind having your kids walking around stinking like a citronella candle, then this product&#x27;s for you. I can&#x27;t believe two of the reviewers for this product said it smells nice. It is beyond awful. It&#x27;s not just a light lemon-y fragrance, it&#x27;s exactly like those cheap citronella candles you burn outside to keep mosquitoes away. I sprayed it on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and then threw it right in the garbage. I will say however, the shampoo and the conditioner do not have this awful smell.</li>
    <li> I have used this the last week with the shampoo and conditioner. It smells good and holds my daughters fine hair in place! There are a couple lice &amp;#34;hosts&amp;#34; in her class so I am being extra cautious. Braid or pull her hair back everyday! This product works great! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Yes, this is hairspray. Leave-in conditioner would be better for you if you need your kid to have soft, shiny hair, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective as the gel and Spray &amp; Shield together. We&#x27;ve had a lot of lice in our community, and my kids have weathered many outbreaks since they&#x27;ve started using the gel and Spray &amp; Shield. We&#x27;re religious about using both every morning including non-school days (something I was happy about as I watched my kid&#x27;s soccer teammate keep stealing his hat and putting it on this past weekend). My middle daughter has long, thick, curly hair (think Hermione Granger), but she doesn&#x27;t have a problem brushing the spray out on her own every night. I&#x27;ll take the crispy hair look over lice any day!</li>
    <li> After I ordered this, a fellow parent warned me Fairy Tales&#x27; Rosemary Repel &amp; Shield would be sticky. She said to go for their Rosemary Leave In Conditioner. It was too late for me to change my order. It did arrive fast. It&#x27;s only sticky for a little while, then it hardens like a shell. I guess that&#x27;s what they mean by shield! Do not make the same mistake, go for Fairy Tales Leave In Conditioner. I wish the seller would grant me an exchange, but they have a final sale policy.</li>
    <li> I used this product religiously everyday on my daughter before she went to school.  No more than 2 months into the school year she came home with head lice.  She was one of only kids in the class who caught it from the little one who brought it in.  So much for this product warding off the little critters.  Worst experience EVER!!! I spent over 500 dollars for a professional nit picker to come to my home and eradicate the issue .....she took one look at the fairy tales bottle and laughed.  This stuff does not work.</li>
    <li> We spend a lot of time in the woods with various Girl Scout activities.  We found most regular hair sprays actually attract bugs.  Not only does this spray not attract the bugs my daughter says she notices a huge reduction in the number of bugs that buzz around her head when she wears this hair spray.</li>
    <li> I love that this is supposed to repel lice!  My daughter has long hair that is curly and thick - getting lice would be a nightmare!  This holds her hair nicely and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
    <li> I was suppose to be buying the Fairy Tales Repel Hairspray and SHIELD AS IT SHOWS IN THE PICTURE!!!. What I received was the hairspray and the item can not be returned. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 11 year old daughter. Smells good, she just sprays in on every morning before school.</li>
    <li> Kid hairspray that smells good. We use this every day for our son and it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it works. I use it after I use the hair gel. My kids have not had lice since I started using these products and that&#x27;s about four years now.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever for head lice BUT you really need that metal comb.</li>
    <li> It is too strong, it broke my daughter out severely</li>
    <li> This has been an excellent repellant for my preschool aged child.. Only disadvantage is the horrible smell.. I try to add perfume to her to hide the smell of the spray.</li>
    <li> I like this to use as a preventive spray in the mornings since I&#x27;m an elementary teacher.</li>
    <li> I will never again go without this product after being caught off guard for a week.  While we don&#x27;t use everyday, we use enough of it to feel that this product really helps keep the bugs away (along with wearing hair up).  We enjoy the scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> Used ever single day and my kids got lice!</li>
    <li> Have not used this very much, because it is very hard to deal with the smell. I like it being all natural, but it is still flammable. I would like to use it more, being the fact so many of family members we avoid due to an ongoing problem and this would be perfect to at least visit.</li>
    <li> Product was great but shipping took FOREVER!!</li>
    <li> HATE head lice!  My kids have gotten it three times at school before I finally switched to using Fairy Tales hair products.  Cannot say enough good things about them.  We have missed getting lice the last several times it went thru school and I am convinced it is because we use Fairy Tales shampoo, conditioner, and hair spray.  Also does not smell awful like most chemically based lice products!</li>
    <li> This hairspray works great and - knock on wood - my daughter hasn&#x27;t gotten lice!</li>
    <li> Cannot live without this product!  With all the outbreaks at school....our girls have never come home with the dreaded....I won&#x27;t even write down the word!</li>
    <li> We have been using this product as per the recommendation of other parents and I have to say we made it through the first year of preschool without any incidences....so far so good!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Arrived on time and definitely worth the price paid.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff! at first, i wasn&#x27;t too keen on the smell but, over time, it&#x27;s grown on me. surprisingly, this holds really well, too. it&#x27;s the only hairspray i&#x27;ll use for my 6 yr old.</li>
    <li> A little confused never used these products but I&#x27;m getting very nervous there&#x27;s two cases of lice in my daughters class what&#x27;s best the leave in conditioner spray or the har spray? Is the hair spray just for styling type ?</li>
    <li> I bought it for my granddaughter and after being nit free and using the spray, the nits returned!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was this spray or not but 3/4 of my som&#x27;s class got live and he didn&#x27;t!  Neither did my daughter during this crazy live outbreak at our school.  I would give it 5 stars if it actually helped detangle a little better.</li>
    <li> Takes awhile to get used to the smell. Overpriced</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my daughters hair since she came home with lice from school in the 3rd grade. She is now in 5th grade and has been lice free, even when outbreaks have occurred in her school. I highly recommend these products to every parent.</li>
    <li> Very good product i recommend this too mothers with kids in school</li>
    <li> Love this product, but the cover was not secured before shipping and when it arrived at my house it was only half full.</li>
