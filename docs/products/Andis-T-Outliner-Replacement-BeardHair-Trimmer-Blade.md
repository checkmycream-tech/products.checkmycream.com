<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great price for a replacement blade.</li>
    <li> My second one. Sharp, clean, keep me lined up. Easy 2 install. Buy it, u want go wrong with it...</li>
    <li> My package came quickly but it was to good to be true. The blade was broken on the corner wich cut me when i tried to use it. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Easy to install and worked great in getting those tight lines/edges when I cut my hair.</li>
    <li> perfect shopping and product.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy, cuts great</li>
    <li> Sharp blades fast shipment</li>
    <li> Well, is a good item, the andis trimmer is the best blade, i like very much!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. Fast delivery. Perfect fit &amp; smooth cutting.</li>
    <li> Good as usual. They are good to go straight out the package or for a closer cut you can adjust them. I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone</li>
    <li> I notice that a majority of the complaints about these blades are they come dull. Well mine came and were not properly aligned and trying to get these blades properly aligned is a pain in the a**. I have to wonder if the complaints about them being dull are really the same issue as mine and they are simply not aligned which would make them cut like crap if at all. They could &amp;#34; seem dull &amp;#34; They come oiled up and you basiaclly have to wipe them down completely because these things are the type of thing you fumble around with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original blades broke after the clippers fell. This brand new set I got I had to screw on and off over a dozen times trying to get the blade positioned just right. Finally I I was putting them back on for the millionth time On my counter and the top blade fell off, fell off my counter on to the kitchen floor and broke like they are made of glass. I&#x27;m done with this trimmer. I am not dropping another $15 on blades that may come without being aligned properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades should be pretty straight forward IMO. The fact you are selling something like this and you have numerous 1, 2 , and 3 star reviews is telling if you ask me. It tells me that these blades are not straight forward. You might get a set and they work perfectly. But then again you might not.</li>
    <li> Replacement blade is same as original and of excellent quality.  Great price and easy to install.  Shipping was fast.  Item is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It was a great item, at a good deal.</li>
    <li> Had to replace the old one because it had fell and broke, ordered a replacement and it cuts like magic!</li>
    <li> Solid product - Shape and easy to install. Will purchase again</li>
    <li> This saved me from buying a whole new unit. Andis quality is always there.</li>
    <li> No issues and good replacement.</li>
    <li> This piece saved me alot of money after  I dropped a pair of clippers and chipped the blade.  This was just as good as a new pair at less than half the price. great price and shipping speed.</li>
    <li> Great product and more cheap than other. It fit so perfect!</li>
    <li> Fits perfect.  Fits just like the original trimmer blade.</li>
    <li> You can tell the difference in close shaving and edging</li>
    <li> Sometimes sharp, sometimes dull.</li>
    <li> Item was as described great replacement for a broken blade that was dropped.</li>
    <li> Fit right on my edgers</li>
    <li> Awesome 300% cheaper than Sally&#x27;s and andis website Luv it</li>
    <li> Wow, this was exactly what I needed for my Andis T-Outliner. Installation was easy and after reviewing a few tips to make sure they were aligned optimally I&#x27;ve had no issues. My linings are sharper than ever now. Just don&#x27;t forget to consistently clean and oil your blades.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my T-outliner</li>
    <li> After I dropped my trimmer, and broke the blade, needed one of these replacements.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the original, or so it seemed to me.&lt;br /&gt;I clean and oil the blades regularly as well.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe need some sharpening?</li>
    <li> Find it right on the dime. Made in USA finally. works nice and perfect. I will update after a year of use, how would it do in future.</li>
    <li> I dropped my t-trimmer and broke the corner on the blade, this  Andis T-trimmer replacement blade was perfect very sharp and easy to install it is adjustable.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, not knowing if the blade came as a pair (the inner blade and the outer blade), but it did.&lt;br /&gt;My problem was dull blades and a loud vibration. These blades were easy to replace... issue solved. And because I am in pursuit of the perfect close cut, I have one complaint that these blades are not perfect. It may be my own blade adjustment, but I am satisfied with my purchase. FAR better than buying a new pair.</li>
    <li> Thanks In Advance,Brought This Replacement Blade For My Andis  Outline II FOR THE USE OF CUTTING HAIR AND IT WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED. YOU WANT BE DISAPPOINTED ABOUT ANYTHING YOU BUY FROM AMAZON.</li>
    <li> My first review yay. First time I bought it was great.  Second time, there were hair inside the blade.  Gross, but I had to use a lot of rubbing alcohol.  I am paying $2 extra next time buying these blades at the salon supplies near by.  Other than the hair was inside the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; blade, it was ok</li>
    <li> Same as the original!</li>
    <li> These things break like glass, buy plenty.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and product works great</li>
    <li> I use this blade to shave!! when I go to the barber to trim he cant believe its not a razor I use to shave!! very close cutting!!!</li>
    <li> Dear Andis,&lt;br /&gt;You make me happy. You turned my frown upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Love Always,&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Dave&lt;br /&gt;Xoxo</li>
    <li> Cuts like a charm. You just need to adjust the blade with screws on the back of it and your be ready to cut and line up anybody you want.</li>
    <li> I took the old ones out and put this blade in easy replacement and they cut nicely</li>
    <li> The one that I got was a little dull.</li>
    <li> Nice blade just the wrong one</li>
    <li> Good and easy to install.</li>
    <li> Works well. I will buy again and again. Never let  blades dull again because this is the product you will need.</li>
    <li> Excellent product;  shaves very clean.</li>
    <li> cuts like brand new again</li>
    <li> The blades weren&#x27;t sharp. I should have believed the reviews on here. I can&#x27;t say they don&#x27;t work because it&#x27;s not true and they are an improvement over the old ones I replaced, but they aren&#x27;t even close to as sharp as the original ones.  I&#x27;ve been using them for a month or so now and if it were up to me, I&#x27;d buy from a different seller. Also, there is no reason in H*LL these blades should cost this much, that&#x27;s insane to me.  They are a good 1/3 of the price of the ENTIRE machine.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time, but when I put it on clippers, very dull and not sharp at all. I  question if it was new</li>
    <li> Great price but these blades were used and advertised as new. I noticed the pack had been stapled but didn&#x27;t think nothing of it. Installed the blades and it was pulling the hair, leaving hair behind , plus having to take more swipes across the area more. The ending results always is Bumps. It was sold buy Amazon warehouse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve order these a few times over the years. They work and fit great. Makes your T-Outliner good as new.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Good price.</li>
    <li> Got this as a replacement because i dropped my machine and brook the edge of the blade that came with it, so far so good, easy to install and cuts sharp!</li>
    <li> Blade came in a little dull and was not set to cut as my original one. Product is not very consistent when it comes to cutting adjustment!</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t much to write about, blade arrive promptly and installing was simple. They cut great.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Saved me time and moneyf</li>
    <li> No bad Andis stuff yet.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, excellent quality!!!</li>
    <li> Exact same replacement</li>
    <li> great replacement for my T-Outliner</li>
    <li> Perfect fit... Easy to install...</li>
    <li> Had the blade but no bolts</li>
    <li> Great Blade for professionals like myself.  I&#x27;ve been a customer for about 15 years and I have not been disappointed!</li>
    <li> Had two pair of trimmers needing new blades. Bought new trimmers when I got these blades, wished I had of just got the blades. Perfect</li>
    <li> The blade seemed to be dull. I don&#x27;t know what else to say besides this. sharpen the blade and it would be great.</li>
    <li> ordered for a friend so i guess he likes them i didnt get any complaints</li>
    <li> compatible, works well</li>
    <li> I guess it might be hit or miss with these replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;My old blades that I threw away do a cleaner, sharper cut then these &amp;#34;Brand New&amp;#34; ones.&lt;br /&gt;I kind of have to question if these are actually new blades, or if I have been scammed.&lt;br /&gt;Quality-wise they look fine, they are just not sharp at all.</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery I recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I have had the same hair trimmer for about 8 years, with 2 replaced blades so far and it works just as well as the first day it was purchased, yielding the SAME results as if it was brand new. VERY easy to install, just two screws and your done. Blades are perfect and manufactured well.</li>
    <li> I was sent the wrong blade. Didn&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of sending it back so i bought a new set of clippers instead.</li>
    <li> I am a very good choice in deciding to replace Hair Trimmer Blade, I think I&#x27;ll continue to do so because I have to present very good results</li>
    <li> Work &amp; fit great. Be careful cuz if you&#x27;ve grown use to your old dull ones the sharpness of these may catch u off guard.</li>
    <li> This and is blade is on my trimmer .Its new sharp and clean. You can&#x27;t get it at a better price.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to get around my ears and have my wife square off the back of my neck. Just wish they would come with screws too, but I was able to get some from the local hardware store.</li>
    <li> I received my clippers for my bday in January. They were good at that time. After traveling around the world and being dropped a few times, they started pulling. As such, i purchased the replacement. I have to say, these blades are actually BETTER than when my clippers were new. It is nice to have such a close shave once more</li>
    <li> Works great. Fits as expected</li>
    <li> great product.just as described.</li>
    <li> Ordered this blade and once I attached it to my Andis outliner, I noticed my beard line ups were sharper, just how it was when I first bought the trimmer. Will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> My blades got dull on my clippers and I thought that I would lose money on  my investment and would have to buy a new set of clippers. I asked my barber whom is also a good friend of mine if I could just buy some replacements and he led me to these. I am so happy that they make replacement blades and at the cost I am able to buy them and still enjoy my investment. I definitely recommend if you don&#x27;t want to buy new clippers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Andis T-blade for over thirteen years.  There is nothing like a brand new set of blades and a fresh cut.</li>
    <li> I ordered a new blade and was unpleasantly surprised to find that the package was unsealed, the blade was dull and still had hair in it. Very disappointed by this. My old blade is sharper than this supposed &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the package sooner than expected. That&#x27;s the only good thing I can say about this order.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Very sharp and cuts flawlessly. Fits my clippers like charm. By far the best set of clippers.</li>
    <li> This replacement fit my Model G clippers but they are not sharp at all. They did a decent job of beard cutting but the line job was average at best. I have to get them sharpened</li>
    <li> Every time I install new blades I am shocked by how easily the trimmer glides as it cuts hair.  You just don&#x27;t notice them getting dull slowly over time.</li>
    <li> Great Price for replacement</li>
    <li> fit my trimmers perfectly! Good and sharp.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the blade that came with the unit as I dropped it and the edge chipped off of the old one. When this came I was happy that it arrived faster than anticipated. I replaced the old one on my unit pretty easily as well. Unfortunately when I went to shave the next morning it didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting as close a shave as before and when I looked closely that was definitely the case. While the stock one shaved incredibly close for an electric razor this one leaves the 5 o-clock stubble like most others do. I&#x27;m now going to have to purchase a new one and I&#x27;ll be avoiding getting it from this seller.</li>
    <li> The product is as advertised but it should come with some instructions at least for the price you pay.</li>
    <li> they seem to rust and stick after a week or two but when you first get them they work like you have a new pair of trimmers</li>
    <li> Dull. Even my broken ones were better. Just buy a new clipper. 2 star because I got them cheap.</li>
    <li> Better than original razor that came with the Andid clippers. A+</li>
    <li> great these are wonderful and work very well great product</li>
    <li> When I bought this product I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I&#x27;ve used it several times and it gives a nice clean line.</li>
    <li> Love it. Brand new again!!!!!</li>
    <li> They are like new, now I just have to figure out how much to tighten them, they get too tight and start freezing or too loose and vibrate way too much, but thats my issue... they came sharp and well oiled. Made my Andis new again.</li>
    <li> My old broken one cuts better. You can see that cutting edge is not as deep as the original.</li>
    <li> Good product. Workes well. Clean shave for me!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these babies.  Stevie Wonder could line you up straight with these!! The price is about $5 cheaper than I can find here locally.</li>
    <li> Replaced my stock one just need to keep blades oiled.</li>
    <li> This product was a replacement for the original part. It made my clippers cut like brand new! I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Replacement was (OEM) fit, and performance was seamless. Even the packaging was exceptional, wrapping the new blade in moisture proof material shows concern for the product and most of all the person purchasing. Will definitely purchase again and would not hesitate to recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> These Blades came Very Sharp.</li>
    <li> I need better deel for me to do buy bigger amont that be good bout of us</li>
    <li> Blade came as described and works well.</li>
    <li> the exact thing i was looking for love it.</li>
    <li> The blade wouldn&#x27;t cut a single hair, I could literally cut better by using my bare hands to pull the hair off my head. Garbage. Super dull even after multiple adjustments</li>
    <li> Blades are not sharp @ all... Terrible!!! Wish I never opened them up so I can get back my money</li>
    <li> Always buy andis...I have watched barbers use these since I was a toddler...they just work.I adjust mine out the box...replace every two months</li>
    <li> Awesome. It works great the first time. Esay to install. Great to do business with you. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT IS OF UPMOST QUALITY!!!</li>
    <li> exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong blade for my Clippers. My bad!</li>
    <li> The T blade has been a quality blade for as long as a can remember. It hasn&#x27;t changed. However, the price in the retail stores has increased significantly. I&#x27;m glad there are other sellers that maintain reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> The correct and a brand new replacement part from the manufacturer, delivered promptly in damage proof packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this model of shaver for several years now and found their website easy to navigate without unnecessary clutter.</li>
    <li> This blade is sharper than the pro-mate.  I had the pro-mate blade and was never satisfied with it.  I switched back over to the andis blade and I&#x27;m happy again.  My next blade is the long tooth blade made by andis.</li>
    <li> Cut likes a RAZOR!!!! be careful zeroing the blades, It will cut !! **ouch-ies on my face!! Lol</li>
    <li> Great replacement. It was easy to put on. Just as good as the original. Would recommend it for the Andis T liners</li>
    <li> The blade I received was not sharp at all. I ended up just using my previous blade. I guess it&#x27;s just luck of the draw. Never had this problem until now.</li>
    <li> Very sharp! Great for shaving and trimming.</li>
    <li> the blades wouldn&#x27;t line up right, one side was lower than the other. had to use the upper piece from my old trimmer and the lower from this one to get it to work right</li>
    <li> It is exciting what I needed.</li>
    <li> What a difference a new blade made!  I would have bought it sooner it I would have known!</li>
    <li> Sharper but still prone to rusting despite treatment to prevent after every use with ANDIS Cool Care Plus.</li>
    <li> Great purchase for a replacement blade. Does what I expected it to do and the price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> My item arrived in new packaging and to my surprise the blades were used and and had hair on them.  I had read some of the one star reviews that stated the blades were dull and some even questioned wether or not they were new. I wish I would of listened, because they were not new.  I returned the blades and was told a new set was on the way.  We will see, but I would recommend purchasing else where.  I am a huge fan of Amazon and this is my first negative experience, but I this is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Had this clipper for 10 years now. Second replacement blades I had to order, because of me dropping and chipping corner off. Great Blade and little machine!</li>
    <li> I love this T blade does what I need it to do. Beats buying the whole machine with that same blade.</li>
    <li> Works great at half the price of local beauty supply stores</li>
    <li> The blades were great,in also on time.</li>
    <li> Item arrived early but blades were just a bit dull.</li>
    <li> very fast delivery and good product</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my blade broke  on my edge up clippers and i was using the blade off my weaker clippers and it was cutting nowhere near close and crooked so i replaced it with this blade and wow it was sharp and it actually cut closer then my origional blade .Overall im satisfied i cant really ask for anything else only thing i didnt like was it didnt come with the 2 screws to screw the blades on other then that its amazing</li>
    <li> seemed to replace the original blade but it didnt seem to fit my razor as well.  nor did it seem to cut as well.&lt;br /&gt;still glad it is possible to obtain a replacement blade.&lt;br /&gt;too pricey. for 15 bucks more i could buy a whole new razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with Andis clippers for the last forty years and always keep extra blades on hand. I&#x27;ve tried&lt;br /&gt; others, but they are no match to this product.</li>
    <li> Everthing as promised.</li>
    <li> I got just what I ordered and it has worked well in my T-Outliner.</li>
    <li> hello, i have been grooming and cutting hair for over 15 years, and Andis products have never failed me yet. Awesome!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product I definitely would recommend&lt;br /&gt;Very good product, I definitely would recommend, I could not find anything better for this price range elsewhere</li>
    <li> Great price. Original equipment.</li>
    <li> Wonderful replacements!</li>
    <li> Good price and was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> Sharpest blades I know of and was delivered on time</li>
    <li> I bought this replacement blade because the corner of my old one broke off. After receiving my new blade I accidently dropped it onto the floor trying to install it and the corner broke off again! The blade weighs only a couple of ounces and to break after a fall from less than a foot high makes me question the quality of the build material.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. My clipper looks and work like its new again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great! I got this for my husband. He thinks it&#x27;s great. He also needed one. So no problems at all.</li>
    <li> Replaced the old one and I worked well.</li>
    <li> It is smooth and nice</li>
    <li> it was the correct blade and it works and fits fits perfectly</li>
    <li> goes on easy works well</li>
    <li> but give it an instruction sheet...</li>
    <li> Thx for the replacement!</li>
    <li> I never thought it would make such a big difference. I have the old blade way too long, it was carving me a new face. The new blades are too smooth. Way to go Andis!</li>
    <li> It seems like 1 out of every 15 or so of these is either dull or mis-aligned. I think this warrants a 1-star review. I dropped my t-edger a few days ago and needed a replacement so I got these but they were mis-aligned. I hope that the next pairI order will be good to go.</li>
    <li> just what I need and great price</li>
    <li> It met all my expectations</li>
    <li> These were  not sharp at all and did not cut well. I had to return them</li>
    <li> Item came before estimated delivery date... Cuts pretty well just not as sharp as I thought they&#x27;d be.... I&#x27;m overall happy tho</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal ..</li>
    <li> Works well and is priced right.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for great product</li>
    <li> This blade works well but i get to replace every six months. Can I get them sharpened?</li>
    <li> Just right works perfect with my device</li>
    <li> They work great and the price is even better. No complaints, I wasted over $30 at sally beauty Supplies. Tge clipper blades are the best</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about this because I got the wrong trimmer blade I can&#x27;t use it. I would like to send it back and get the right one.</li>
    <li> Great item glad I got this item. Price was great and it was what I wanted. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Fit and shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement of the original blade.Cuts clean and close. great for detailing around ears, and for necklines, also eyebrows. Quality.</li>
    <li> not to good dont cut well</li>
    <li> Installation was easy and it&#x27;s default setting is not too sharp and it trims like a champ! Fit my andis trimmer like a glove.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! I would but it again. Save a ton if cash! Make sure you want a sharp lining!!!! Lyres.</li>
    <li> Well packaged and authentic. Amazing replacement for my current, broken blade. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace,  works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent! My husband cuts hair &amp; my kids hair as well &amp; I love how it leaves perfect lines! :) plus it cost cheaper then Sally&#x27;s beauty supply!</li>
    <li> It was a nice, quick replacement. After replacing my 2 year old trimmer blades, it felt like they were new again! I do recommend using/buying hairclipper spray for your new blades to keep them lubricated.</li>
    <li> Needed a replacement and this is a good buy.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Works like a charm and the only reason I had to replace it was because I dropped the clippers and chipped it....great service also.</li>
    <li> I need to learn how to adjust it properly because my dog now runs from when whenever I try to shave logos into his fur. He used to love it.</li>
    <li> For me is the best blade.. Is very durable and the price is very good. I recommend you. Andis is the best brand!!!</li>
    <li> Really can&#x27;t complain too much about the factory blade. I like the T blade so much more than the regular Outliner blade. Glad I went back to this one. Got a nice, crisp line and didn&#x27;t have to go over it a million times to get it to cut.</li>
    <li> These blades aren&#x27;t all the same. You&#x27;re kind of rolling the dice on getting one that&#x27;s not dull vs one that cuts sharp without breaking skin.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much my face had been suffering from the old blade. Easy to replace. Just do it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the third time a friend of mine bought this item and always the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has his andys trimmer machine since 2000, so it&#x27;s about 3 years by blade giving him a perfect trimmer cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He usually uses it twice (and sometimes three) a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on his recomendations and results I bought one andys machine last year and I still using the blade that came with it and its perfect.</li>
    <li> the best  blades for the best clipper bar none hands done.  don&#x27;t buy a new set of clippers if your trimmer blade broke.  just replace them and youre good to go!  love my andis clippers I have had mine for over 3 years and they are still going strong! I would recommend getting the cool care plus spray to keep them from rusting and to keep them lubed up.</li>
    <li> Blade works wonderfully -item was shipped the next day.</li>
    <li> Cut like  new we&#x27;ll worth my money</li>
    <li> Normal blades nothing special.</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied at all. Blade was dull barely engender cut &amp; would constantly pull hair.</li>
    <li> brought my clippers back to life.</li>
    <li> It works perfect with the trimmer. Very easy to switch out.</li>
    <li> Clipper bit looked a little dusty..but heck it works lol</li>
    <li> These things are so cheap. Already cracked after just less than a month..</li>
    <li> From the time I changed my blade and shaved I noticed a big difference, a closer shave and smoother feel</li>
    <li> I have ordered OEM blades a couple of times from Amazon and until this set have all been great. This set never cut well and pulled like they were dull even after multiple alignments and oilings. Not very happy.</li>
    <li> It was fine and came in sealed pack and I&#x27;m satisfied ,thank you</li>
    <li> Just as seen on amazon .... No complaints  here ... Fitted it to my andis clippers and it works fine .... Not as sharp as my replacement tho but still does the job fine</li>
    <li> I can finally get another close shave without biting.</li>
    <li> this is what i wanted,got no problem</li>
    <li> Was happy. Got what I wanted. Fit perfect</li>
    <li> The new replacement blade turned my broken andis clipper back to being new again</li>
    <li> Not quite sure if this is a pair or a set of blades</li>
    <li> Great replacement. Works just fine.</li>
    <li> U know what to expect from the Andis liners. I have been getting my haircut with their product for 30+ years</li>
    <li> replacement blades looks new fit like a glove but was not sharp so did me no good have to order new ones again</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace a broken blade on my Andis GTX Outliner. The replacement blade was easy to install and fit perfect!</li>
    <li> Awesome fast shipping</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a barber but I use this blade to shave my head three times a week. Andis clippers and blades are the best so you can&#x27;t go wrong. Price on Amazon is much better than buying at beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> Pretty dull. Cuts okay now, but I can see them deteriorating quickly.</li>
    <li> I had concerns about whether or not the replacement blades would fit my clippers, they are working wonderfully.</li>
    <li> PERFECT!! exactly what I needed,works just like original. The only thing is if you want barber shop sharpness you need to adjust them but the original blades are the same way. YouTube has videos to teach you.</li>
    <li> Fit like a glove just as I thought.......now all I need is the cleaning kit and the bag set all is good</li>
    <li> After accidently dropping my T-Outliner head first in cement, I went to my local sallys to check how much a replacement cost. I was not going to pay 25 retail, so i checked them out online and trusting Amazon more than ebay, I found em cheap here so I bought them. The blades were the exact ones I previously had, of course these were sharper and new. The blades came in the original display box, both top and bottom blade. Great price, and fast shipping. All the comments about being dull and machine vibrating are wrong. It may be the way you have your machine adjusted. A++++++ overall</li>
    <li> Best clippers out there and at best price I can find right here.</li>
    <li> OEM blade is the way to go. Price is very reasonable</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and shipping was fast. I would definitely order this again because the price was great too.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Stand by the clippers and the brand, replacement blades make this set even more simpler.</li>
    <li> 5 stars should explain it all.... it&#x27;s better to order here and get the best of the best... than to spend 18 to 20 bucks on a blade from the hair stores here in philly... free shipping too... I will order again... thanks</li>
    <li> This blade had missing teeth when i got it. Seemed to have been thrown around before it got to me. Have not gotten a replacement either. Ended up going to a local beauty supply shop.</li>
    <li> I started using the blades and they work perfectly and fitted onto the machine nicely with out and alignment problems.</li>
    <li> Worked as expected and shipping time was fast</li>
    <li> Easy to adjust! Cuts real close now and no biting or burning. I use for shaving and it shaves me closer to bald than any other to be honest. Get on YouTube to learn how to adjust them and these should be the last brand of liner/shaver u get</li>
    <li> These blades were a perfect fit for my And is clipper and they provided a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand new and it came to me broken!</li>
    <li> This works as good as the one that came with my andis</li>
    <li> not the correct size for the model</li>
    <li> Everything was timely and arrived as advertised...very pleased with the results ands service.</li>
    <li> exact fit for my clippers, but the blade was not as sharp as it was suppose to be</li>
    <li> Great blade and fits perfectly</li>
    <li> not as good as the original that comes with the item. the replacements should be the same quality but they arent</li>
    <li> Great replacement blades</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for</li>
    <li> This fits perfect. Relatively sharpa nd create a nice line. Not too sharp though as it havent cause any cuts to my skin.</li>
    <li> My teenage son thought he needed to purchase a whole new clipper set, but I found theses and now his original set is good as new.</li>
    <li> Item is as described.</li>
    <li> Buying this was a major improvement compared to my old dull blades. Nice and sharp with the right blade adjustment you could have a fresh line up in no time!</li>
    <li> the product is very good.</li>
    <li> Happy to locate the replacement part. Did not want to buy a new hair trimmer. It fits and is working like new!!!!!</li>
