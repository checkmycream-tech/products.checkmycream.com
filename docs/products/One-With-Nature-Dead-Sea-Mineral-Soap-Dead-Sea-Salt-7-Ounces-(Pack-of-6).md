<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Somewhat of a skeptic but a bit desperate lately i was suggested to buy and try this product . I have to say i really Love it ! Not only does it give a good clean but also helps moiturize with the shea butter in which i have seen improvement with my Psoriasis . I have not only recommended but have given samples out of this product to friends and they also have loved it .</li>
    <li> You would think soap without fragrance would be easy to find but nope, it is actually hard to find.  Since fragrances give my hubby headaches, we have had to search hard to find one he likes and he loves this one.  It is a great soap and much cheaper here than in the stores.</li>
    <li> For dry skin that cracks, use this product, I also use it as a total body soap, and face, it takes away the age spots, and brings back you skin the way it should look, after using it apply your oils to bring back the extra softness to your skin. And it removes lines on the face, try it. Well I like it for my home daily body care.</li>
    <li> I cannot confidently state that the soap cleared my acne, or if my acne was cleared by other means. However, since using this soap once a day on my face, along with jojoba oil as a moisturizer after, my skin has significantly improved. The soap will dry out your skin if you do not moisturizer, but overall, this is a great product. My skin feels great, looks great, and I will certainty buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this soap !! It makes me feel squeaky clean however it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out !!!! No heavy sent I will order it again and again !!!  Shipping was fast and easy !!!</li>
    <li> Great soap!  My daughter has extremely sensitive skin and this soap is wonderful.  We were purchasing the same brand at Sprouts - but found it on Amazon and decided to buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> This is great soap. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and its actually help clear it up. I used to get pimples random places on my body - After using this soap after a few weeks I noticed the ones i had were gone and I didn&#x27;t have anymore. Great soap.</li>
    <li> quick, with no problems</li>
    <li> I had psoriasis for almost two years before buying this soap.  It helped a lot, my body is pretty much back to normal before I had psoriasis.  Feels more like the minerals in the soap help my skin adapt to psoriasis and calm it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however still have a little inverse psoriasis that comes and goes in my armpits, the soap doesn&#x27;t seem to help inverse psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because the EWG&#x27;s website cosmetic database said it was a 1, meaning very low health hazard. It gets really sudsy and lathers very well. It has not dried out my skin and I love how clean I feel after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Dead Sea Salt for psoriasis; but this is so easy.  It lathers perfectly and makes skin smooth while gently removing the extra skin from psoriasis spots.</li>
    <li> After reading hundreds of reviews of other &amp;#34;acne fighting&amp;#34; products, I settled on trying this soap, as it, by far, had the best reviews. My teenage son and I both have problem skin. His is severe acne from teenage imbalances; mine is moderate acne from stress, hormones, etc. After using this soap for the first time, just before bed, my son woke up to much clearer skin. The scarring and redness seemed to diminish too. His skin didn&#x27;t look as &amp;#34;painful&amp;#34; as it usually does. I was also surprised by the size of the bars. They&#x27;re HUGE! If this continues to work well and doesn&#x27;t fail to the dreaded plateau-effect, I will be one happy momma.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Leaves skin very smooth. Excellent, nourishing natural soap. Not scratchy at all.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing and leaves the skin feeling soft.  I would definitely buy this soap again.  It&#x27;s a must try!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite soap and use it multiple times per day. Leaves no film and gets me clean. Does not fry out my skin either. No heavy perfumes which I can&#x27;t stand. It&#x27;s a big bar of soap and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> love the feel of crispiness after shower, soft to skin,no odor, so pleasant to use. I buy it for years in big quantities.</li>
    <li> I bought this same 6 pack in 2010.  It was $18.00 then.  The price increased $11.00 in about 3 years.  I love the soap and bought it again but I believe the price increase is a bit much.  You decide...  If anyone knows a place to get it cheaper I would love to hear about it.  In the meantime I plan on making my own.  Google it... looks pretty easy.</li>
    <li> We love living in a very rural area.  However, shopping for something outside of the usual can be an &amp;#34;adventure in and of itself&amp;#34;.  I have sensitive skin and when I discovered this soap several years ago I became a real fan!  Our local market does not have this.  I was so pleased to find it on Amazon,</li>
    <li> nice product and shipped quickly.  bought as extra stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> My wife struggles with dry skin. The best skin she ever had was when she visited the ocean. This soap does the trick. It lasts a long time too.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. This is the only soap I&#x27;ve found that does not make me break out in an annoying rash. A bonus is that it softens my skin, too. It is very hard to find in local stores. I looked on Amazon and saw it for the same price as anywhere else. I bought a boxful, free shipping.  It saved me driving 40 miles round trip plus the cost of gas to get to the health foods store.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin that can also be very dry.  This soap is gentle but cleanses my skin well and seems to help balance it out.  It is a tad drying on the face, but no more than other products I have used (in fact less than most), and I use a moisturiser anyway.  It does not smell as strong as other sulphur soaps.  Great value.</li>
    <li> this terrific soap has been perfect for my sensitive skin causing no itching and no rashes.Beatls out other soaps recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases, I am really pleased with this soap. I will no longer buy chemical based soap. I used this and also use africa black soap for a change of pace. I like both.</li>
    <li> Tried this years ago. Got it at a health store and been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> I can say good one but  not treat as you thought</li>
    <li> The website item picture is incorrect, and the product label on the received item is incorrect. The received item appears to be One With Nature Shea Butter Soap (which contains the ingredient Dead Sea salt as do all 19 types of bar soap that the One With Nature company manufactures), but the received item appears to be mislabeled with the One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap label. After I received the item from amazon.com and opened the package, I saw that the soap color appeared to be the same dirty-white shade as One With Nature Shea Butter Soap and not the brighter white color of One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap. I am familiar with both types of soap. One With Nature Shea Butter Soap has a higher concentration of shea butter in the soap. On a previous occasion, I purchased One With Nature Shea Butter Soap in a local store. During and after showering, it left my skin feeling oily compared to One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap. On another occasion before receiving my most recent order of this product from amazon.com, I ordered One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap from amazon.com. On that occasion, each bar of soap in the order had the label One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap, but the dirty-white color of each bar of soap appeared to be the same color as One With Nature Shea Butter Soap. On that occasion, during and after showering, the soap made my skin feel oily compared to One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap, which I regularly have been purchasing at a local store for more than two years. I have resumed purchasing One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap at my local store because the soap in the store is properly labeled and is the product that it should be - One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap, not One With Nature Shea Butter Soap. (One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap is one of the best shower/bath soaps I have ever used. It earns a 5 Star rating. It is very high quality and organic. The soap is triple milled and is much longer lasting that the more common lower-quality bar soap products in the USA. It creates a very rich lather and makes one&#x27;s skin feel wonderfully clean. I highly recommend the product, but do not order it from amazon.com. If you do, you probably will not receive One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap. Instead, you probably will receive what appears to be One With Nature Shea Butter Soap that is mislabeled with the One With Nature Dead Sea Salt Soap label.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(ASIN: B001E5D0JS One With Nature Dead Sea Mineral Soap, Dead Sea Salt.)</li>
    <li> This soap keeps my skin clear all over,helps with itchy rashes too. When I first used this soap,I found it made my skin feel soft as a baby&#x27;s skin.One With Nature Dead Sea Mineral Soap never dries my skin,yet it helps my husbands oily skin.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  I like soaps with sea salt because they help keep my skin clear and my skin feels refreshed after every shower.  This product does the opposite.  It dried out my skin really bad and cause break outs.  It also felt like I had a film on my skin after shower.  I was disappointed by this product.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful. It makes your skin so soft and really lathers nicely. If you are used to perfumed soaps this one will take some getting used to. It  has no perfume but it really helps your skin. I buy it in the six pack and although it sounds expensive,but the bars last so long. This is my private stock of soap so each bar will last about 6 weeks with daily use. I am still on my first bar. I highly recommend this soap. Your skin feels soft after you use it, but I still put coconut oil on my skin after every bath to help even more.</li>
    <li> I bought Ahava dead sea bar soap which got rid of my psoriasis (which then came back a few months later).  I found this for a drop cheaper and I figured dead sea is dead sea.  Well, it doesn&#x27;t work the same.  I guess I had unrealistic expectations.</li>
    <li> Nuts give me a migraine, so I forgot I had decided not to use argan in case I ingested some.  So 4 1/2 hours after my shower, I got my migraine and realized it was from washing my face with this soap.  I don&#x27;t react if I am very careful not to get it on my face.</li>
    <li> I like this soap. It gets you clean and will keep your skin clear. It leaves you with a light clean scent without being over powering. It does tend to dry you out, but I have somewhat oily skin so that is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> Kills the bacteria that causes BO. The best smelling summer I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve tried clinical deodorants. This soap is what you need.</li>
    <li> I will next time get this soap with a scent vs this one with zero scent BUT this soap is GREAT for your skin -- i already have very soft skin but the first shower with this soap and then i was like WOW my skin is even SOFTER - its very nice!!!!</li>
    <li> I first found this in the natural products section of a local supermarket, but they stopped carrying it - I&#x27;m so glad I can find it on Amazon! This soap is very mild on my sensitive skin, lathers nicely even in hard water, and has a neutral scent. The bar lasts longer than South Of France bars. All natural, not tested on animals and no animal ingredients. The multi-pack is a good price, imo, and convenient to keep my closet stocked. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Unscented, natural soap that cleanses well and is reasonably long lasting. Purchasing the 6 pack is more economical than buying individually.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a beauty product connoisseur, but after finding this soap, I won&#x27;t be buying anything else. This is the best I have found, and I have tried A LOT of products. Helps clear up blemishes REALLY well. Also heals broken skin faster. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, leaves it smooth and silky. There is a very light yummy fragrance, but it is so mild, I can&#x27;t even smell it half the time. But when I do, it&#x27;s heaven. Yeah, just get some.</li>
