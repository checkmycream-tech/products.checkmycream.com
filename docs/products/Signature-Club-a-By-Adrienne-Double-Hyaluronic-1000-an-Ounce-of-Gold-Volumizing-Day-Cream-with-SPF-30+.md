    <li> One of the BEST products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick cream.  I used to use Eucerin day cream but it was too watery for my taste, switched to this and live happily ever after.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly, and package is the same as the product I have been using. (I haven&#x27;t opened the ones I ordered, but the product that I&#x27;m using is the same.) The cream has a nice texture, and a small amount goes a long way. I use it under my make-up in the morning, with positive results. Makes the skin look more youthful, but one warning-- it burns and causes discomfort if you get it in your eyes, so avoid the sensitive eye area.</li>
    <li> I do not go out without it , it smooths out your lines in your face,and you can wear under makeup, or without makeup.. Also the cost here is so reasonable, try it , a great product...</li>
    <li> Love it.  Will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have not tried this product but be aware it is filled 3/4 full. You are not getting the entire ounce!!!</li>
    <li> I love it.  It&#x27;s like a filler for fine lines and, unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see it on the website anymore</li>
    <li> Double Hyaluronic 1000 an Ounce of Gold is top of the line daily face cream with spf protection which is a bonus</li>
    <li> Item as advertised, received promptly.</li>
    <li> Soft and smooth as silk, applies evenly, and melts into your skin. It has a wonderful brightening effect. Nice smell. Lovely moisturizing and it has SPF also! Great product for the price. I use this as my daily moisturizer and sunscreen for the face, neck, and décolleté.</li>
    <li> Super product.  I love the way it goes on and feels.  It really makes my face and neck look better.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years now and I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I put this on and let it soak in for a few minutes before apply make up.</li>
    <li> if you use a day cream witch all of us getting older should you should give this cream a try. I love it and its worth the money.my skin looks so much smoother i see less of the fine lines around my eyes.i use it on my face chest and hands it really makes you fill like you had a face lift and under the chin its wonderful can see changes there as well.this is a cream i wont be without. now have other people ask me if i had WORK DONE</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have very dry skin.  I works to moisturize.</li>
    <li> This made my skin break out.  I think it would work well on many skin types.  But mine is sensitive.  I had break outs the next day.</li>
    <li> This is a superb Day Lotion. I&#x27;m in my middle 40&#x27;s with sensetive skin (always prone to breakouts). My skin absolutely loves this cream and a little goes a long way! Love it!</li>
