      <li>Smells Fabulous</li>
      <li>this cologne is not the same as I have experienced before.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell near as good as the soap-</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice the smell after I put it on, but other people walk by and have asked who smells so good!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not overstated, it&#x27;s clean and familiar</li>
      <li>I am returning this for a full refund.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite - not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Smell fabulous, came quickly in safe packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Would totally buy again!</li>
      <li>Buy All Different Kind Of Products In This Blanc Blend.  </li>
      <li>I love the soft, fresh smell of this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Several people have come to my desk and asked what smelled so nice</li>
      <li>and I bought it without sampling it first.</li>
      <li>unless it&#x27;s a truly exceptional example of a knockoff), but I instead suspect that it is very old Bulgari, perhaps someone&#x27;s stock that sat on the shelf for waaaaaay too long, and the perfume has deteriorated with time to basic elements, which may explain the strong rubbing alchohol smell when you first spray it.  </li>
      <li>I own several Bvlgari products and this one, was a complete knock-off.</li>
      <li>Smelled of pure rubbing alcohol when I sprayed this onto my skin....</li>
      <li>This is pure alcohol tinged to smell like the real thing.  </li>
      <li>My favorite - and getting harder to find.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Plus, it&#x27;s much cheaper than I found it in the stores.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t have much of a sent,</li>
      <li>I really doubt the authentication.</li>
      <li>Smells very chemically</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t the real perfume.  </li>
      <li>I have a real bottle and</li>
      <li>But would still recommend if someone likes the other Bvlagri scents -- one of the better ones.</li>
      <li>You better go to Sephora or other places for fragrances.</li>
      <li>I wanted something more musky and less powdery.</li>
      <li>I read the online reviews of this product before ordering it, noted that several people said this might be a knockoff, but I have enough confidence in Amazon and my long history with them to assume those might be troll postings, and there were some good reviews, so I took a chance.  </li>
      <li>We did after we stayed for a week in a high end hotel that uses this scent of body wash.</li>
      <li>High quality.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is long lasting - greater than 12 hours.</li>
      <li>This perfume is mild and lasts long; smells fresh, clean, and not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Love, love love this cologne, but it&#x27;s very expensive in Macy&#x27;s and purchased it on line for half the price.</li>
      <li>My new go to perfume.  </li>
      <li>The scent wasn&#x27;t as strong as the product I purchased previously</li>
      <li>this and this smells like pure alcohol and barely has any scent.  </li>
      <li>compare the old bottle and new bottle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would really like to try the green tea and the red tea as I am sure that they are equally delectable.</li>
      <li>It is soft and lasts all day.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this perfume !!! On-time delivery! Congratulations !!</li>
    <li> I read the online reviews of this product before ordering it, noted that several people said this might be a knockoff, but I have enough confidence in Amazon and my long history with them to assume those might be troll postings, and there were some good reviews, so I took a chance.  And got burned.  The product arrived yesterday and I immediately noticed, as several other posters remarked, that it sprays on smelling like pure rubbing alcohol.  I did notice after a few seconds the ever-so-slightest hint of Bulgari smell, but by 10 minutes later even that had faded and what was left was .... nothing.  No smell of ANYTHING at all.  Any long-time Bulgari user can attest to the fact that one of the really attractive features of their scents is that they are very long-lasting - literally all day.    I compared the bottle/packaging to what I already had and they are identical, so I&#x27;m not really convinced this is a knock off (unless it&#x27;s a truly exceptional example of a knockoff), but I instead suspect that it is very old Bulgari, perhaps someone&#x27;s stock that sat on the shelf for waaaaaay too long, and the perfume has deteriorated with time to basic elements, which may explain the strong rubbing alchohol smell when you first spray it.  Not sure, but it is definitely NOT what you want.</li>
    <li> Best smelling perfume ever! You will seriously get addicted to this stuff. We did after we stayed for a week in a high end hotel that uses this scent of body wash.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne! First experienced it at the Ritz Carlton, it was the soap in the room! Fantastic, many complements!!</li>
    <li> I order this perfume to make a present and it&#x27;s a tester with no cap and they don&#x27;t say it in the product description.  So, I lost my money, because it was for a person I am not to close.</li>
    <li> The only perfume I wear are those by Bulgari and I wear several of the scents.  This is one of my favorites.  I am always asked what perfume I am wearing, which is one of the reasons I chose Bulgari.  I don&#x27;t want to wear what everyone else does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this item.  I got it in a sealed box, and the cologne itself is on spot, scent wise.  This is the only scent I wear and today, I put spray on new this new bottle.  Several people have come to my desk and asked what smelled so nice -- it was me!!!  I will buy from this site again.</li>
    <li> Half the price as in the department stores! Great buy! Love this fragrance! Loved having this shipped directly to my home at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. Not too strong and not too light. This scent stays with me all day and I get compliments everywhere that I go. I would really like to try the green tea and the red tea as I am sure that they are equally delectable.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this versatile, clean fragrance!</li>
    <li> Since Ultima II is no more and stashes have dried up. This is my new favorite - not overpowering. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume scent.  Very light, yet distinctive.  I don&#x27;t notice the smell after I put it on, but other people walk by and have asked who smells so good!</li>
    <li> Nice and light scent. I always receive compliments when wearing it. Perfect for day and summer</li>
    <li> I love this calogne, that is all I can say.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this cologne.  Love, love love this cologne, but it&#x27;s very expensive in Macy&#x27;s and purchased it on line for half the price.</li>
    <li> The scent wasn&#x27;t as strong as the product I purchased previously but I guess you get what you pay for. The price is very good in comparison with buying it through Macy&#x27;s or like retailer</li>
    <li> I am very Happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Price is very good.&lt;br /&gt;I compare the old bottle and new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is exactly same.</li>
    <li> Ahhhh....bought this so I could smell like white tea and aloe of the Westin hotel.  I&#x27;ve been searching for something to match that scent forever and this is it.  Works even better with the lotion layered underneath it.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! Will do bussiness again!!! Txs</li>
    <li> There is a 1mm long brown particle floating in the bottle... I really doubt the authentication. You better go to Sephora or other places for fragrances.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  It&#x27;s not overstated, it&#x27;s clean and familiar</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  It is soft and lasts all day.  I have received many compliments on this perfume and my husband loves it&#x27;s romantic soft smell.  It&#x27;s my favorite and I had previously purchased the smaller bottle at Sephora for a lot more money and when that bottle was almost empty I decided to look on Amazon for it.  I found it in the larger bottle 2.5 oz for $20 less than what I had paid for the smaller bottle.  Would recommend and buy it again from Amazon</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!  Always get compliments on it.  Bvlgari better not stop making it...finding a signature scent takes forever and I don&#x27;t have the time to do it again.  This one is it!</li>
    <li> I was concerned that this was going to be one of those &amp;#34;plain brown box&amp;#34; perfumes you find at those perfumeries that may or may not be expired and may or may not have fallen off the back of a truck.  I was very happy to find it was still factory sealed in the factor box, not expired.  it cost a lot less than going to the store, and I didn&#x27;t have to wade through the clouds of 100 other perfumes to get to it.</li>
    <li> I like this scent in the lotion verson, but for some reson it does not translate as well in the perfume. It is still a great, light scent, but I prefer the lotion to the spray. But would still recommend if someone likes the other Bvlagri scents -- one of the better ones.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after I discovered the lotion/soaps at a Rtiz Carlton a while back. I own several Bvlgari products and this one, was a complete knock-off. Smelled of pure rubbing alcohol when I sprayed this onto my skin....hardly the correct scent or even a hint of the scent I usually buy from department stores. I am returning this for a full refund. I am livid about this.</li>
    <li> It has a powdery smell to it. It could just be my body chemistry. I wanted something more musky and less powdery. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just not what I wanted and I bought it without sampling it first. It looks authentic though, and came well packaged.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  And I get many complements from it.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite at a good price!</li>
    <li> My favorite - and getting harder to find.  I just wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> this cologne is not the same as I have experienced before.  Smells very chemically</li>
    <li> This perfume is mild and lasts long; smells fresh, clean, and not overwhelming. Everyone loves it! I&#x27;m buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love the soft, fresh smell of this fragrance.  Good for any season or occasion, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I receive tons of compliments from men and women on this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;This Bottle Came In Quick &amp; Smell Wonderful.  Just As Expected.&lt;br /&gt;I Buy All Different Kind Of Products In This Blanc Blend.  Smells Fabulous</li>
    <li> My new go to perfume.  I used to wear Creed Silver Mountain...$400 a bottle.  Now I can buy 4 for the price if the one.</li>
    <li> I believe it was a knock off. It didn&#x27;t have much of a sent,</li>
    <li> I love this.  It arrived on time and is a perfect light scent for the summer.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Big fan</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell near as good as the soap- and that&#x27;s what scent I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> My favorite(and only) scent for the past 4 years. People stop to ask me what I&#x27;m wearing so they can purchase it for themselves or others. One of my high school students asked me to write the name of it down for him so he could purchase it for his girlfriend! It IS expensive, but the soft, lovely floral scent is intoxicating.</li>
    <li> Great condition, I am happy I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice but Iike the shower gel and lotion more.</li>
    <li> Thank you! Very good price and quick shipping. I will order again!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and it was just what she was looking for.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> My favorite at a great price!</li>
    <li> I have ordered Bvlgari perfume from this site 3 different times and had no trouble what so ever!&lt;br /&gt;Love the fragrance!! Best Prices and received quickly!</li>
    <li> The genuine article at a great price</li>
    <li> Beautiful product, high quality and excellent, quick service.  Thank  you.</li>
    <li> love jove this fragrance...I get so many compliments when I wear this</li>
    <li> Smells great. Lasts a long time. High quality. Reasonably priced. I would also suggest the  Bvlgari Au the Blanc soap. It is very strong and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This is pure alcohol tinged to smell like the real thing.  This isn&#x27;t the real perfume.  I have a real bottle and this and this smells like pure alcohol and barely has any scent.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is expired or what the problem is, but don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, great price.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is long lasting - greater than 12 hours. Couple of squirts is all one needs.  The bottle is going to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for mothers day.  We both like it.  Nice clean crisp fragrance.  My last purchase was Bvlgari Black (another unisex cologne) which I would highly recommend also.</li>
    <li> Love it - fresh and light</li>
    <li> Smells great! Plus, it&#x27;s much cheaper than I found it in the stores.</li>
    <li> Love it. Came in earlier than expected. Great price.</li>
    <li> Simply divine...package got here in perfect condition.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Smell fabulous, came quickly in safe packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Would totally buy again!</li>
