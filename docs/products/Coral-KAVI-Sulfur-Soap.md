      <li>It lathers nicely and has no medicinal order and it works great for controlling my oily skin.  </li>

      <li>After 5 years of searching for some amazing treatment that I may have overlooked, I stumbled upon Kavi skin care and the information about sulfur, acne, and rosacea.  </li>

      <li>Nice product.</li>

      <li>I do wish that it had a better scent to it, but over all I love this soap!</li>
      <li>So, I am confident that this was effective in helping to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have used pharmacy as well as high-end products and this soap is the best so far.  </li>
      <li>Her skin was left feeling great and looking great.</li>
      <li>I have tried many glycolic washes and it&#x27;s by far the best for me.</li>
      <li>Aside from that, I&#x27;m really pleased with how it has improved my skin.</li>
      <li>I have used many of the Kavi products and they all worked wonders.</li>
      <li>Also, it is not the most pleasant-smelling soap, so if you have a hypersensitive nose, you might want to try something else.</li>

      <li>i love this product.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I am completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>:).</li>
      <li>If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many preventative soaps and had to get on an acne medication to control them no matter</li>
      <li>I used it in conjunction with their SA 15 peel, which helped smooth out the surface of my skin.</li>
      <li>I only use it once a day and have experienced no dryness or irritation.  </li>
      <li>Worth a try, for sure.</li>
      <li>I have fair sensitive oily acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products and have had good results, but they seem to wear off after a while.  </li>
      <li>I tried to clear my acne breakouts with prescription meds and nothing worked as good as this soap.</li>
      <li>I will try using this soap for my arms and back maybe it will be more effective on these area.</li>
      <li>but, it is a tremendous help for acne and oil.</li>
      <li>but the quality and potency of their products are worthy of mention.</li>
      <li>Firstly let me say that it&#x27;s generally good to take product related reviews with a grain of salt.</li>
      <li>I also use it for my back and it has not disappointed me :)  </li>
      <li>This stuff was great back when I would get the occasional zit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d actually rate this above anything else i&#x27;ve tried because while the smell isn&#x27;t great, it does seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Just in the first week my skin started to purge it&#x27;s pores, just like any good acne treatment it gets worse always before it gets better.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much</li>
      <li>and I noticed a change in my skin from the first use.  </li>
      <li>Definitely don&#x27;t need to buy more than one at a time.</li>
      <li>&amp; it was not expensive.</li>
      <li>I can really tell a difference with my rosacea!</li>
      <li>Soap works ok, but doesn&#x27;t clear up skin completely; unlike the prescription version.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually starting to be able to wear normal deoderant again!</li>
      <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
      <li>but, it really is a quality soap that works well for problem skin.</li>
      <li>But, this soap is gentle on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea problem.</li>
      <li>But it didn&#x27;t really help my complexion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for about a week or so, but so far I am quite satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I have to agree with the other reviewer in that you will most likely breakout during the first days of use.</li>
      <li>Sure it stings a little when the suds get in my eye.</li>
      <li>And at that point it was still like half the size it originally was!</li>
      <li>I pretty much do not put any products that are strongly basic  on my skin.</li>
      <li>Another immediate result I noticed was that my skin did not get as oily as it normally did.</li>
      <li>I received a package in the mail within two days with a new pump.</li>
      <li>and I am very sensitive to soap.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cleansing without being overly drying, doesn&#x27;t smell, and I would say it helps to dry out pimples with occasional use, but overall not the cure for more severe acne sufferers.</li>
      <li>that to say, the only major change I&#x27;m aware of doing is switching to this as a body wash.</li>
      <li>After 3 months my skin is almost completely clear and it stopped all of my rosacea flare-ups.  </li>
      <li>I am now 29 years old.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for several years and am very satified.  </li>
      <li>It might have completely cleared my acne up if I didn&#x27;t feel the need to stop using it because of the smell.</li>
      <li>I have had acne since I was 11 years old.  </li>
      <li>Though pricey for a bar of soap, this product has really improved my son&#x27;s acne on his face &amp; back.  </li>
      <li>appreciate KAVI because they are all pH conscious.</li>
      <li>Takes a little time before you feel the full effect</li>
      <li>I have to admit, when a friend of mine (who&#x27;s married to an md)told me that one little bar of soap would clear my skin I doubted her, but it did!  </li>
      <li>within a week of using this product my skin began to clear and by eliminating all the extra steps that other acne products have you go through I have saved so much time!  </li>
      <li>I have not had skin this clear in 10 years despite dermatologist visits and trying numerous products.  </li>
      <li>I finally threw it away just because it was so old.</li>
      <li>I have called several times with questions and the company is the most knowledgeable I&#x27;ve spoken to so far about products and the science behind it in general.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> It&#x27;s not a miracle but it definitely limited new acne development and reduced existing acne over a week and a half period.</li>
<li> Since I started using kavi a few months ago I have only had a few blemishes, which is really a miracle!</li>
<li> It lasts quite long as well.</li>
<li> So they kepted my money for the item i never got, and only partially refunded me for the soap.</li>
<li> Bought this soap because it had same active ingredients as sastid soap (which has discontinued use), but it does not nearly as well.</li>
<li> now use if every other day only in the evenings after working out,</li>
<li> and I can use it to get rid of the oil and still not burn, irritate, or dry out my skin.</li>
<li> Over that time I have tried every single acne product that is over the counter and have been in and out of the dermatologist&#x27;s office trying whatever the dermatologist would recommend.  </li>
<li> After 15 years of topical use, the tretinoin not only stopped working, but I developed acne rosacea (an unfortunate and unforeseen side effect).  </li>
<li> Also, check out their website, they have so much information about skin and the mechanisms behind it.  </li>
<li> They are expensive but she says it was worth the money.</li>
<li> I do not know why the other review was negative, perhaps they didn&#x27;t use the soap long enough.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have combination skin with hormonal acne. I have tried everything on the market to help reduce my acne with no luck, until now. I originally purchased this product because the reviews were great &amp; it was not expensive. Since I started using kavi a few months ago I have only had a few blemishes, which is really a miracle! I am so very happy I found this WONDERFUL product!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other cheaper sulfur soaps. I think Grandpa&#x27;s Sulfur soap outshines this one. This soap is way to expensive, so save your money.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, when a friend of mine (who&#x27;s married to an md)told me that one little bar of soap would clear my skin I doubted her, but it did!  I love this soap! within a week of using this product my skin began to clear and by eliminating all the extra steps that other acne products have you go through I have saved so much time!  I do wish that it had a better scent to it, but over all I love this soap!</li>
    <li> I have used pharmacy as well as high-end products and this soap is the best so far.  It is not too drying for me and controls the shine factor.  I breakout around my jawline but have not since using this soap.  I also use it for my back and it has not disappointed me :)  Pros:  control breakouts  Cons:  sulfur smell</li>
    <li> Bought this soap because it had same active ingredients as sastid soap (which has discontinued use), but it does not nearly as well. Does not work well to begin with.</li>
    <li> Soap works ok, but doesn&#x27;t clear up skin completely; unlike the prescription version. I have a little drying, but lotion fixes that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Coral Kavi for several years now. I&#x27;ve always had acne prone skin and this is one of the products that stopped my breakouts. My whole family uses it. I have used many of the Kavi products and they all worked wonders.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about a week or so, but so far I am quite satisfied with the results. I have to agree with the other reviewer in that you will most likely breakout during the first days of use. I never had problems around my jaw and neck, but I got cystic acne for a couple days and cleared up soon after. Another immediate result I noticed was that my skin did not get as oily as it normally did. Come to think of it, the oiliness in my T-zone has gotten better with continued use (I was matte all day today!). Also, it is not the most pleasant-smelling soap, so if you have a hypersensitive nose, you might want to try something else. Aside from that, I&#x27;m really pleased with how it has improved my skin. I used it in conjunction with their SA 15 peel, which helped smooth out the surface of my skin.</li>
    <li> Sure it stings a little when the suds get in my eye. But, this soap is gentle on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t aggravate my rosacea problem. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I am completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product is the best that I&#x27;ve found for clearing my acne prone skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products and have had good results, but they seem to wear off after a while.  Not Coral Kavi.  I use it twice a day along with Kavi toner (daily) and an occasional glycolic acid peel (about weekly).  My skin looks better than ever!</li>
    <li> Though pricey for a bar of soap, this product has really improved my son&#x27;s acne on his face &amp; back.  We&#x27;ve tried numerous washes &amp; creams, &amp; the Kavi sulfur soap, combined with an 8% BHA serum, has done wonders.  Even before adding the BHA serum, this wash was already keeping his breakouts under control.  He still has breakouts, but after we made the decision to avoid the acne Rx until he&#x27;s done growing, we found this to be the best OTC wash we&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I have had acne since I was 11 years old.  I am now 29 years old.  Over that time I have tried every single acne product that is over the counter and have been in and out of the dermatologist&#x27;s office trying whatever the dermatologist would recommend.  Eventually I found a combination that would work which included tretinoin.  After 15 years of topical use, the tretinoin not only stopped working, but I developed acne rosacea (an unfortunate and unforeseen side effect).  I started to have horrible allergic reactions on my skin to anything with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, fragrance, alcohol, and more.  So now I have acne and rosacea and no way to treat it!  The dermatologist recommended topical meds for rosacea made it worse.  After 5 years of searching for some amazing treatment that I may have overlooked, I stumbled upon Kavi skin care and the information about sulfur, acne, and rosacea.  This was it!  I have yet to use a Kavi skin care product that is ineffective.  This soap works wonders on my abundance of blackheads.  Just in the first week my skin started to purge it&#x27;s pores, just like any good acne treatment it gets worse always before it gets better.  It works best with a scrubbing pad.  I use Earth Therapeutics Complexion Pad.  After 3 months my skin is almost completely clear and it stopped all of my rosacea flare-ups.  If I could give this product more than 5 stars, I would.  I also use the Kavi toner every time after I cleanse.  It does have alcohol and salicylic acid in it, but for some reason does not give the same allergic reaction as others, in fact, it calms my skin.  I will always use these products and I am thankful to have found them.  I hope Kavi never stops making them.  Also, check out their website, they have so much information about skin and the mechanisms behind it.  They don&#x27;t just simply make claims, they have the scientific information to back up their products.  I do not know why the other review was negative, perhaps they didn&#x27;t use the soap long enough.  I hope this info helps!</li>
    <li> This stuff was great back when I would get the occasional zit. I am since clear-skinned and don&#x27;t use it anymore but I still recommend it.</li>
    <li> I hate that this product actually seems to work pretty well at relieving acne because it leaves a slightly off-putting smell to your skin for the rest of the day. It&#x27;s not a strong sulfur smell it&#x27;s just an off smell that is distracting and not all that pleasant. It&#x27;s especially bad when you sweat because your sweat smells like sulfur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of clearing acne. It&#x27;s not a miracle but it definitely limited new acne development and reduced existing acne over a week and a half period. It might have completely cleared my acne up if I didn&#x27;t feel the need to stop using it because of the smell. I&#x27;ve tried everything, including accutane and a bunch of salicylic creams and nothing seems to work as well as this without causing pretty bad side effects. I&#x27;d actually rate this above anything else i&#x27;ve tried because while the smell isn&#x27;t great, it does seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use if every other day only in the evenings after working out, when I know that I wont have to put up with the smell all day and don&#x27;t have to be worried that other people are detecting the slightly off-putting smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and am very satified.  It cleanses effectively without drying my skin.  It lathers nicely and has no medicinal order and it works great for controlling my oily skin.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist because she knows I won&#x27;t use the prescription meds for rosacea, eczema, etc.  I like it very much and it seems to have improved my skin.  I only use it once a day and have experienced no dryness or irritation.  Worth a try, for sure.</li>
    <li> I have fair sensitive oily acne prone skin. I read wonderful reviews about this soap and decided to give it a try. I have been using this soap for my face for about two weeks and my skin became extremely oily and the breakout extremely worsened. I realized this was not effective for my face, so I decided to order another soap and I got it today whithin few hours I can see my breakouts improving. I have nothing against this company I am just sharing my personal experience :). I will try using this soap for my arms and back maybe it will be more effective on these area. I think I might have reaction to sulfur...</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my sister as she has Pityriasis Versicolor and she said they work wonder. Her skin was left feeling great and looking great. The soaps are an alternative to oral medication and she can take a break in between. They are expensive but she says it was worth the money.I will be getting her some more soon.</li>
    <li> This soap worked great on my oily skin and gave me a really nice &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling after using it!</li>
    <li> I can really tell a difference with my rosacea! Nice product.</li>
    <li> Working great on excess oil and reducing beard dandruff or dermatitis. May cause drying so once a day is sufficient preferably before bed to allow face to replenish any stripped oils.</li>
    <li> Firstly let me say that it&#x27;s generally good to take product related reviews with a grain of salt. I say this because it is likely that when people comment on products they don&#x27;t tell you everything they do/use. They may unknowingly have other factors affecting the \\&quot;results\\&quot; they seem to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that to say, the only major change I&#x27;m aware of doing is switching to this as a body wash. Since then (about 6 months, I no longer get bumps on my back or shoulders. So, I am confident that this was effective in helping to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate KAVI because they are all pH conscious. This greatly affects your skin. I pretty much do not put any products that are strongly basic  on my skin. This has greatly helped to not create a comfortable home for bacteria and acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use his on my face but I preferred the glycolic wash. Side note: I have tried many glycolic washes and it&#x27;s by far the best for me. I have oily skin and I can use it to get rid of the oil and still not burn, irritate, or dry out my skin. I can even use it in the winter. It also helps with marks left behind from acne. I knows this is a coral review but the quality and potency of their products are worthy of mention. I have also tried the sulfur suspension and the salicylic 8 peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for their customer service, I have to say hat it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve encountered. I have called several times with questions and the company is the most knowledgeable I&#x27;ve spoken to so far about products and the science behind it in general.&lt;br /&gt;I received a product with a broken pump and I sent an email to them about it. I received a package in the mail within two days with a new pump.</li>
    <li> i love this product. will be ordering this product again!&lt;br /&gt;the only draw back is that it smells sort of bad, but not unbearable.</li>
    <li> I started using this product for my acne rosacea and I noticed a change in my skin from the first use.  I am very happy with this product. I have not had skin this clear in 10 years despite dermatologist visits and trying numerous products.  Despite it having sulfur, I cannot detect a sulfur smell. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great . Used after an exfoliating scrub. No allergic reaction to this and I am very sensitive to soap. Great ingredients.</li>
    <li> I tried to clear my acne breakouts with prescription meds and nothing worked as good as this soap. I use this faithfully morning and night.</li>
    <li> Maybe a bit pricey but, it really is a quality soap that works well for problem skin. It lasts quite long as well. Takes a little time before you feel the full effect but, it is a tremendous help for acne and oil.</li>
    <li> I had this same bar of soap for like 2 years! I used it probably every other day in the shower to wash my face. I swear this bar lasts forever. But it didn&#x27;t really help my complexion. I finally threw it away just because it was so old. And at that point it was still like half the size it originally was! crazy. Definitely don&#x27;t need to buy more than one at a time.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve tried lots of acne treatments over the years, but nothing has come close to the results I&#x27;ve seen with this soap.  I used to have at least one new pimple about everyday.  With this soap my acne has slowed to maybe one or two a week, if that.  Buy this!!</li>
    <li> I struggle with a few skin conditions due to have PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). One is sores that develop under my arms called Hydraditis Superativa. I&#x27;ve tried many preventative soaps and had to get on an acne medication to control them no matter how &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; I am. Due to the antibacterial and antifungal properties in this soap it is helping to clear up my skin. It&#x27;s also a great preventative. I&#x27;m actually starting to be able to wear normal deoderant again!</li>
    <li> I puchased kavi&#x27;s coral soap and glycolic acid 20% peel and i only received the soap. The soap is not good as the family dollar sulfur soap. That being said, What i don&#x27;t like about the customerservice is when i called them and let them know, hey i didn&#x27;t receive the peel with the order what happened that was supposed to be included with my order i placed. The customerservice response was not my problem we weighed the package,So take it up with the post office were not giving a replacement order or return the item you did get and we will only refund for the coral soap.So i returned the order. There weak strength coral soap that didn&#x27;t even dry up any acne and they wouldn&#x27;t send a replacement order or exchange.So they kepted my money for the item i never got, and only partially refunded me for the soap. Dont buy there products they don&#x27;t cater to customer&#x27;s problems with orders and very rude inconsiderate service. I hate i ever ordered from them. Buyers beware there not worth spending your money on.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; is a perfect review. It&#x27;s cleansing without being overly drying, doesn&#x27;t smell, and I would say it helps to dry out pimples with occasional use, but overall not the cure for more severe acne sufferers. I would buy again, though.</li>
