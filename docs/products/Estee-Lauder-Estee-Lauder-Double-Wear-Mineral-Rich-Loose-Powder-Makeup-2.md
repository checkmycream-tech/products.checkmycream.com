### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>RECOMMENDED EXCELLENT PRODUCT QUALITY 100%</li>
      <li>Plus finding it at a great cost on here, what a bonus!</li>
      <li>The packaging was perfect just as in the department store beauty counter.</li>
      <li>Lasts all day and feels great!</li>
      <li>And yes, it does brighten up your foundation and does look very good over foundation.</li>
      <li>Very, very, very satisfied with this powder!</li>
      <li>Great product</li>
      <li>This product was a great bargain.</li>
      <li>And the price was great too: $18.50+$4.35 shipping.</li>
      <li>It seems to be a great match for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>This foundation is great for combination skin, it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break up.</li>
      <li>This product was just as good</li>
      <li>fantastic value on Amazon!!! :)</li>
      <li>This powder offers the best coverage for mineral makeup.  </li>
      <li>Estee Lauder has the best coverage by far, but must be used in conjunction with a primer or moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
      <li>The great thing about getting it from Amazon seller is it was soooo much cheaper than the department store price.</li>
      <li>I have used Estee Lauder products now for more than 30 years, and wouldn&#x27;t consider changing.</li>
      <li>and i am able to go all day at work without touch ups.</li>
      <li>Like so many of Estee Lauders products, this powder is fine and very smooth, but for the price, I can honestly state that there are now very nice drug store brands that work as well for a lot less.</li>
      <li>Beautiful look, the color seems to blend nicely &amp; wasn&#x27;t too dark for a fairish skinned person.</li>
      <li>This is the only makeup I can wear and it is always nice to find it at a good price.</li>
      <li>The coverage isn&#x27;t fantastic, but it&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
      <li>It is as it says mineral rich face powder.</li>
      <li>Great coverage, natural look, stays matte, just use a bronzer on cheeks and nose to give some glow, and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
      <li>this is a good product - it has buildable coverage - it doesnt hightlight my fine lines and it doesnt dry out my skin or cake.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon!</li>
      <li>only 4 stars because I think the pressed powder is better at not rubbing off, more coverage &amp; lasting longer, but I would buy this again.</li>
      <li>Love this loose powder.</li>
      <li>I really like the way it blends and the volume of the product.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for providing this seller and their products.</li>
      <li>The shipment was fast and packed well.</li>
      <li>This powder provides next to flawless coverage, and I love the base color.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a long time for a mineral loose powder that will fit my needs, I have tried many different brands and finally I found it!</li>
      <li>Smooth coverage, long lasting.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping and overall content.</li>
      <li>I have paid almost twice as much for the same product.</li>
      <li>I do use a basic primer with it to make it last longer - i have very oily skin</li>
      <li>The only thing that surprised me was the size of the container.  </li>
      <li>With Bare Minerals I use medium beige and this color was very similar.</li>

<li> Alone, alas zero coverage for me.</li>

    <li> I have used this powder for quite awhile. Its absolutely no fuss, just brush on and go.  The great thing about getting it from Amazon seller is it was soooo much cheaper than the department store price.</li>
    <li> I saw this in a department store for almost double Amazon&#x27;s price.  In the summer, I like lighter coverage.  I use a BB cream and then dust this on with a brush.  Lasts all day and feels great!</li>
    <li> Love this loose powder. Long lasting and non clumping. Thanks Amazon for providing this seller and their products. I have used Estee Lauder products now for more than 30 years, and wouldn&#x27;t consider changing.</li>
    <li> I bought this instead of my usual Bare Minerals foundation. This product was just as good and it was less expensive. With Bare Minerals I use medium beige and this color was very similar. The coverage isn&#x27;t fantastic, but it&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. I will buy this again when I run out!</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed.  The only thing that surprised me was the size of the container.  I thought it would be a larger container.  That is my fault because I didn&#x27;t notice the size when I ordered it.  Great product</li>
    <li> This is the only makeup I can wear and it is always nice to find it at a good price. The shipment was fast and packed well.</li>
    <li> I have used bare minerals, lancome, and estee lauder&#x27;s loose powder foundation. Estee Lauder has the best coverage by far, but must be used in conjunction with a primer or moisturizer. This may be due to my small pores and relatively normal oil levels on skin. Without moisturizer underneath, the powder doesn&#x27;t apply well and is, well, powdery.</li>
    <li> Very, very, very satisfied with this powder! I was looking for a long time for a mineral loose powder that will fit my needs, I have tried many different brands and finally I found it! And the price was great too: $18.50+$4.35 shipping. Would buy it again and again and again! Thanks to Amazon!</li>

    <li> This powder offers the best coverage for mineral makeup.  The packaging was perfect just as in the department store beauty counter. I have paid almost twice as much for the same product. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! I will order again soon.  This foundation is great for combination skin, it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break up.</li>
    <li> It is so small and such a high price! I decided to continue buying it from a store.</li>
    <li> is needed when you use this one. Great coverage, natural look, stays matte, just use a bronzer on cheeks and nose to give some glow, and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
    <li> This product was a great bargain. It arrived on time and was properly packaged. I recommend this product to all women.</li>
    <li> this is a good product - it has buildable coverage - it doesnt hightlight my fine lines and it doesnt dry out my skin or cake. I do use a basic primer with it to make it last longer - i have very oily skin and i am able to go all day at work without touch ups.</li>

    <li> This make-up is NOT mineral foundation.  It is as it says mineral rich face powder. I thought I was buying mineral foundation not face powder.  It can be used with liquid foundation if you want coverage. Alone, alas zero coverage for me. And yes, it does brighten up your foundation and does look very good over foundation.</li>
