      <li>This product is a great conditioner but a true protein!</li>

      <li>I found that although nice, it does not stop shedding, which we need to retain length.</li>

      <li>This stuff is awesome for my very curly hair.</li>
      <li>I also noticed that my hair have  a nice shine to it.</li>

      <li>personally I liked the Bambu&#x27;s scent much better...</li>
      <li>love it&lt;</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>But again, I like Silicon, just not in LOVE</li>
      <li>Figured, hey what is one more try??</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use any conditioners on my hair because my hair gets very greasy, but this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>love this.  </li>
      <li>so after using this product for only a couple times (which by itself alone is impressive that it worked that quickly)it def helped my hair and</li>
      <li>there that&#x27;s my review take with it what u want:)</li>
      <li>I will say however that the smell does linger, so if you don&#x27;t like that, just giving you a heads up, but I love it.</li>
      <li>Make sure to rinse well</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>

      <li>My hair feels thicker, and more bouncy/lively.</li>
      <li>I love for my hair to smell like my conditioners</li>

      <li>Yes I would recommend this product Love Love Love.....</li>

      <li>If you have tried the original Silicon Mix you will LOVE Silicon Mix Pearl.</li>
      <li>isint easy to get glossy anywyz</li>
      <li>Upon opening the lid I was repulsed by the strong perfumie smell, but decided that I would try it nontheless.</li>
      <li>I have spent up to $50/per container for every kind of hair treatment I could find over the years and this is absolutely the best.</li>
      <li>The best part I like about the conditioner is it will not weight down your hair or leave a residue on your scalp.</li>
      <li>hey when you know better, you do better ;)</li>
      <li>This works great for my hair which is coarse and wavy.  </li>

      <li>(btw I only gave this four stars cuz it wasn&#x27;t as fortifying as id liked it to be since that&#x27;s this products primary claim ...:P ...:)</li>
      <li>The hair comes out soft, smooth, well-conditioned, and with a nice sheen.  </li>
      <li>It feels soft but nice and supple, it isn&#x27;t breaking at all.</li>
      <li>My hair is now full body and bounce.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad and overpowering</li>
      <li>At first, I was kind of skeptic because I have tried many different products and none of them have stopped my frizz.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair super shiny and silky.</li>
      <li>My hair shiny and soft and full of body!!</li>
      <li>I blow dry and flat iron my hair, and you can&#x27;t imagine how happy I was when I saw the results!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love this.  sometimes we put it in and rinse it quickly, other times we rinse it out after ten minutes.  its great, does what it says.  leaves hair more manageable and soft.  we have african american hair.  mine is relaxed, my daughters have 4b curls...kinky ringlets.  works great</li>
    <li> This hair treatment is AMAZING! My coworker brought these amazing product (also the leave-in conditioner) as a gift for me from Dominican Republic. At first, I was kind of skeptic because I have tried many different products and none of them have stopped my frizz. From the first moment I used this, I felt stronger, softer and healhier hair. I blow dry and flat iron my hair, and you can&#x27;t imagine how happy I was when I saw the results! I haven&#x27;t even finished the product and already ordered it combined with the shampoo and leave-in conditioner. This is a life saver! I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i used Silicon mix, Silicon Bamboo,  and now ,i just used Silicon Mix Perla. This Silicon Perla smells the best out of  the three. all the Silicon Mix are great but all three are different. The Pearla makes the hair very strong and soft at the same time. I also noticed that my hair have  a nice shine to it.The Silicon mix Pearla looks like it came from the sea and smells incredible. It left my dry dull shedding hair looking healthy, strong and touchable. My hair is now full body and bounce. and, yes, the shedding stop. i followed up with the leave-in. Now my hair stay soft and strong all the time. The leave-in is great. It makes my hair shine and its not frizzy anymore. the leave-in is great and it smells great like the Silicon Pearla mix treatment. Its very difficult to chose a favorite of the three. They are all fantastic and different. If you go by the fragrance, i would say go with Silicon mix Pearla.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair treatment for my daughter who had very dry and frizzy hair.  I couldn&#x27;t make her hair curly anymore.  After a couple of treatments with Silicon Mix, her hair is slowly coming back.  It is shinier, more nourished and it is starting to get curly again.  She is very happy.</li>
    <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;i recomend</li>
    <li> I used this today on someone&#x27;s hair. Her hair had been breaking and shedding alot for the past month. I used the Huetiful Steamer for 15 min on her hair with this conditioner. I followed up with the Silicon Pearl LeaveIn and a little Almond Oil. Her hair became soft. Man, this stuff makes your hair smell good too. It looked really fluffy after, and the breakage and shedding was less. She is African (American African) and has natural African hair.</li>
    <li> Yes I would recommend this product Love Love Love.....</li>
    <li> This is my second Silicon Mix, I really liked it!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin and blond and it&#x27;s great for my hair too!</li>
    <li> It makes your hair hard</li>
    <li> This product smells AWESOME and leaves your hair soft and shiny for a very good price.  Salons sell the same kind of thing for $30 to $50. Works great and I have been using this product for the last 4 years.  So happy I found it on Amazon</li>
    <li> The greatest deep conditioner I have ever used in my life!!!! If you have tried the original Silicon Mix you will LOVE Silicon Mix Pearl. It leaves my hair with the most  beautiful shine and smoothness I&#x27;ve always wanted. It also smells great which is a plus for me. In addition it really does control your hair from frizzing like it claims to do on the jar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d have to&lt;br /&gt;Say I didint expect it to work as well as it did so I&#x27;m impressed but I&#x27;ll also say I&#x27;ve had better working products like it&#x27;s a ten it&#x27;s the best for fortifying if that&#x27;s what UR looking for but if not and u only have minimal hair damage not major like&lt;br /&gt;Me than this would be a great product for u this product is very moisturizing and made my hair glossy it&#x27;s usually kinda dry and we all kno dry hair isint easy to get glossy anywyz so after using this product for only a couple times (which by itself alone is impressive that it worked that quickly)it def helped my hair and there that&#x27;s my review take with it what u want:) (btw I only gave this four stars cuz it wasn&#x27;t as fortifying as id liked it to be since that&#x27;s this products primary claim ...:P ...:)</li>
    <li> I have been using the Silicon Bambu until I saw this one came up while I was about to put in my reorder...I was a little skeptical because I really like the Bambu and was afraid I would regret my choice... I just used this one for the first time tonight and I am very satisfied with the results already! My hair feels thicker, and more bouncy/lively. I live in a very humid state and my frizz is pretty much nin right now. The smell...personally I liked the Bambu&#x27;s scent much better...This one smells like a musky flower garden. It&#x27;s not bad and overpowering I just prefer the scent of the other better.</li>
    <li> Order this because of good reviews, poor packaging, lid was half way off, leaked all over. Then I read the ingredients, oh no nothing good in this product, not going to use this, waste of money.</li>
    <li> This one might be my second one&lt;br /&gt;Prefer Silicone best&lt;br /&gt;Smells good not as strong as the one with  the Bamboo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a month and use it twice a week when I wash my hair. It never fails to make my hair soft, smooth, and shiny. Detangling is a breeze especially after using this.In addition my breakage has decreased significantly. I love the smell it&#x27;s a soft gentle scent similar to rain drops, that doesn&#x27;t linger for more that two days.</li>
    <li> I have all of the Silicon Mix conditioners, but this one is my favorite.  It has protein and my hair LOVES protein-containing products.  This product does contain mineral oil, so if that&#x27;s a concern, this product is not for you.  Actually, I try to avoid products with mineral oil, but I make an exception for this product because it works so well with my hair.  I make sure my hair is very clean (almost squeaky clean) before using this product.  Then I saturate my hair with the conditioner, detangle with a wide tooth comb, and sit under a hood dryer w/ heat for 20-30 minutes.  When I rinse, I apply the leave-in conditioner of the same line and either roller-set or wet bun.  The hair comes out soft, smooth, well-conditioned, and with a nice sheen.  This is a staple deep conditioner for me.</li>
    <li> I like silicon mix la perla on my naturally curly hair. I dont blow out my hair but love how soft my hair feels and it smells good.  Sometimes I do a wash and go with this Dominican conditioner.</li>
    <li> Made my natural hair very soft and manageable. Very impressed by this product.</li>
    <li> This is a staple for my curly hair care.  It feeds my hair the protein it needs and it smells great.  It is only good for those who have a need for more protein in their hair, or for human hair wigs.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome for my very curly hair. I even use it on my daughters hair too.</li>
    <li> This product is a great conditioner but a true protein! The smell is a HEAVY perfume smell so please be aware. I love for my hair to smell like my conditioners so I&#x27;m okay with it. Make sure to rinse well and if you have an issue with protein and moisture balance only use this once a month. If combined with the leave-in and other products containing protein you might end up with an overload. I know first hand. I will re-buy but it&#x27;ll take me a while as I&#x27;ll only use this once a month.</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations.</li>
    <li> The Proteina de Perla treatment is so good. It left my hair softer, silkier, and nourished. The smell is so nice. I will use this continuously.</li>
    <li> Good product but just beware of the old timie smell...it&#x27;s alot to get use to</li>
    <li> Its good, but if you&#x27;re looking for SPECTACULAR, especially if you&#x27;re African American, then try Alter Ego. Miracle in a bottle! ALL of their products. This stuff smells really nice and is a good value for the price! I do keep it in my arsenal; I use it in conjunction of other things, but there is nothing like a one stop shop! I found that although nice, it does not stop shedding, which we need to retain length. Read my review on Alter Ego. You will use it exclusively and its worth every penny. Never in my life (and I am a product junkie) have I ever used anything like it. But again, I like Silicon, just not in LOVE (anymore)....hey when you know better, you do better ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pantene shampoo and conditioner on my hair for years. Went to the dominican salon and they used Silicon mix on my hair and I liked the way it made my hair feel and look healthier.  I purchased the original and pearl mix and love them both.  I have AA relaxed hair with honey brown ombre color at the ends. The best part I like about the conditioner is it will not weight down your hair or leave a residue on your scalp. This conditioner is great at strengthing and rebuilding damage limp hair.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who product hops constantly only using quarters of products then deciding I don&#x27;t like it and buying something else (a huge waste of money), that is until I found this! I am currently purchasing my THIRD jar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mixed: black, white and native american, with very tight curls that turn into frizz if not properly taken care of, and I had done so much damage to my hair by over-straightening and over heating I lost my curls and ended up with 4 different curl patterns (it looked crazy). I just died my hair blonde-ish, did the big chop and have been working my way back from scratch. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It gives me so much moisture and leaves my hair soft and shiny and my curls springy. I use it as a conditioner almost on a daily basis (I use the silicon mix perla shampoo once or twice a week) and as an overnight leave in deep conditioner at least one to two times a week as well. My curls have come back in full force and my hair has grown at least 3 inches since this past November. Some people complain about the smell but I personally really like it, it&#x27;s very similar to rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any one with very curly hair, looking to somewhat tame and define it; as well as anyone looking to repair and regrow their hair. This gives my hair so much life and I can officially say it has made me a very happy and dedicated costumer :)</li>
    <li> I dint see any difference..</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use any conditioners on my hair because my hair gets very greasy, but this stuff is great. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This product does not live up to the advertisement.  Its okay again it smells good but it does nothing for my hair.</li>
    <li> I happened to find this in a rite aid in FL after fin in the sun summer vacation that left my and both my daughter&#x27;s hair sun bleached and over dried from pool and salt water and excessive sun. We all have naturally curly hair and go thru a lot of hair products. This is the best hair treatment deep conditioner I have ever, ever used. Our hair is shiny, much, much less frizzy and healthy looking. I normally put this on our heads and put a heated hair bonnet blowdryer on high heat for 30 mins and have not had to go to the salon ($$$$$) for a deep conditioning since. I have spent up to $50/per container for every kind of hair treatment I could find over the years and this is absolutely the best. I live in VA and could not find it anywhere in stores here but finally found it on amazon-Thank you</li>
    <li> I have been using Silicon Mix (the original) for a couple of months and I totally love the product. I was recently introduced to Perla by another friend, and boy do I love this product!! It leaves my hair super shiny and silky. The smell is great and my husband has no complaints about it. I will defenitely be buying more Perla soon! Happy Customer :)</li>
    <li> I cant say enough about this.  I have a hair replacement system that is very costly.  I had given up and tried EVERYTHING, about $400 of everything! Figured, hey what is one more try?? so glad I did.  This stuff is amazing!  hydrated, untangled and now lays the hair flat as opposed to a matted knotted ball of hair I had going on.  I have ordered 2ncds, 3rds and 4ths of this.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good product left my hair soft</li>
    <li> Upon opening the lid I was repulsed by the strong perfumie smell, but decided that I would try it nontheless. When I mixed this with Kanechom Goat Milk in a smaller bowl the scent was much less pungent and more soothing. I piled it on my head after shampooimg and when I rinsed it out I was met with unbelievably soft supple hair! I thought my hair could only feel this soft when moisture overloaded, but I was wrong. It feels soft but nice and supple, it isn&#x27;t breaking at all. After I rollerset my hair it felt softer and silkier than ever before. I will say however that the smell does linger, so if you don&#x27;t like that, just giving you a heads up, but I love it. It&#x27;s very light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair very soft!! And less frizz!!!</li>
    <li> Smells divine ! I love the way it make my feel and smell. Everytime I use it I get compliments from my boyfriend on how good I smell.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hair are always tangled and this helps big time when i brush my hair after using the product. Thanks to this product I have finally great looking and shiny hair!</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with 4c hair and after all the rave reviews I thought I would try this product. It did not work for me, It seem to make my hair dry and stiff. My daughter has 4a-4b very dry hair. It seem to make her hair stiff with little moisture added to it. I even tried mixing it with one of those Dominican moisture conditioners which seemed to be the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; thing, it only made the conditioner worse. The Dominican conditioner worked better alone.</li>
    <li> BEST CONDITIONER EVERRRRRR!!! Black Girl! Thick Hair! Soft Hair!!! Smells really good too!</li>
    <li> Great for curly frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> Mixed this with Kanechom Liso. It was horrible by itself. Natural hair products did a better job at softening my hair than these two products  did together. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> just used it today with the Kanechom goat milk protien i left it on for about 40 mins under a shower cap.love the results blow dryed my hair and flat ironed my hair.  My hair shiny and soft and full of body!!</li>
    <li> This works great for my hair which is coarse and wavy.  I pair it with Kanechom Mantega de Karite at a ratio of 3 to 1 and it makes an awesome hair mask!</li>
    <li> I am AA with relaxed hair. I am currently 20 weeks post relaxer and OMG! This is the business! My new growth was extremely soft and so easy to detangle! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I&#x27;m a product junkie so, I use different products every 3-4 days when I wash and DC. I think I will start to use this product more frequently when I am this far into a relaxer stretch.</li>
    <li> This is a great protien treatment for relaxed hair. I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural so managing two very different hair types has its challenges. I am 16 weeks post relaxer and working with 3 inches of new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed with with the Kanechom Brazilian Hair Treatment Goat&#x27;s Milk and its left my new growth soft and manageable and my relaxed ends softer and strong. I placed a plastic cap over my head and leave it on over night.  The conditioner is very thick. I am heavy handed and I like to coat my hair. It makes a great mask for deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its almost smells like baby powder which is awesome.</li>
    <li> Great product - I do recommend and its smells awesome !</li>
