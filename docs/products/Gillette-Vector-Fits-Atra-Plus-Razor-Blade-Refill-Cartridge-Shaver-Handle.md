      <li>Spend the additional $15 or so dollars and purchase a nice metal one instead.  </li>
      <li>Would I have to give up my beloved for over twenty years favorite grooming tool?</li>
      <li>It worked perfect and we now can use all the old blades!</li>
      <li>Very basic Inexpensive handle feels great easy to use and does the job perfectly,</li>
      <li>I still have a stockpile of the old twin-leaf blades (Gillette Contour) and this handle fits them perfectly well.</li>
      <li>I think this was a great find, fit the razor handle just fine.</li>
      <li>Very light</li>
      <li>The replacement shaver handle is very, very light.  </li>
      <li>It is very light</li>
      <li>very light weight; feels like disposable.</li>
      <li>This is very light and probably just plastic.  </li>
      <li>I bought the razor because I found many unused blades.</li>
      <li>But it gets the job done better than all the disposables out there.</li>
      <li>Much better.</li>
      <li>I had so many refils, The newer razors just didn&#x27;t do as well as this one.</li>
      <li>Both the Vector and the Atra blades give a better shave than the Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, or anything else</li>
      <li>but since it came from Thailand and had to pass through customs it was okay.</li>
      <li>and I think disposable may be better then this.</li>
      <li>do&#x27;t take it to bed with me, ok?</li>
      <li>had some left over Atra blades with no razor and this worked perfectly.  </li>
      <li>My husband is satisfied.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fully satisfied, would buy again.</li>
      <li>I have since ordered 3 more handles and a 100 more</li>
      <li>It is Okay, but it is not sturdier and I think it needs tender care to make it last&amp;#62;</li>
      <li>No longer available in the US?!</li>
      <li>Okay, so here&#x27;s the deal with these...</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m pleased to say, they worked much better.</li>
      <li>As described, 100% satisfied</li>
      <li>No problems the Gillette Vector Fits Atra Plus Razor Blade Refill Cartridge Shaver Handle was ok.  </li>
      <li>Took 30 days to arrive, but so do most items that come 1/2 way around the world.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find any ATRA razors and that&#x27;s my favorite blade.  </li>
      <li>if you order from this vendor; better, get assurances via an email before purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>/&gt;The stores have many Atra blades but no Handle for them.&lt;br /&gt;Still using my first blade after 2 weeks still making good shaves.....</li>
      <li>It was packed very well and arrived quickly and in a very good condition.</li>
      <li>They are great little blades and made my husband happy, the razon is his.</li>
      <li>Kind of a light weight cheapie handle, but it does fit the Atra blades I had in abundance.  </li>
      <li>That makes the Vector well worth its own price of $5, which included shipping from India.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if the Vector would substitute for the Atra but was pleasantly surprised at how good it works.  </li>
      <li>Prompt, good service, and it will match the older Gillette twin blade razors, guys and don&#x27;t get concerned about the plastic handle.  </li>
      <li>While the razor worked fine with the cartridge it came with</li>
      <li>It works fine.</li>
      <li>The packaging looked look like it had been through a war when I got it, but the item was fine inside.  </li>
      <li>works just fine.</li>
      <li>Exactly what we were looking for, glad its still available somewhere in the world, and thankful to Amazon for connecting us!</li>
      <li>So this works fine.</li>
      <li>This thing is cheap, but fine for the price I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s ALMOST perfect except that the razor is plastic and a LITTLE on the flimsy side.</li>
      <li>The handle fit the blades I have.</li>
      <li>The handle is light plastic with the clip and retainer which holds on the cartridge being metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light plastic but sturdy.  </li>
      <li>Not solid metal like my 1980&#x27;s Atra handle, but great for traveling.  </li>
      <li>Please help me out ,according to the information it will fit gillitte atra plus or gillette trac 11 but not even one of them works.</li>
      <li>None of the razors fit.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using this.</li>
      <li>By the way, there are plenty of places overseas from which to order inexpensive blades that fit the handle as well.</li>
      <li>I ordered this Vector because the Atra Plus blades fit in it.</li>
      <li>I got this for my atra plus blades, but they don&#x27;t fit on them.  </li>
      <li>Performs well and is light weight.</li>
      <li>price fits the product, cheaply made</li>
      <li>Cheap plastic as well.  </li>
      <li>After using it, I suppose I remembered it to be better than it really was; the newer blades are actually better.</li>
      <li>Product is as expected good!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very light and I think disposable may be better then this.</li>
    <li> Received item shortly after original review. Perfect for use with blades bought years ago.&lt;br /&gt;thank you for sending them</li>
    <li> I got this to use up some old blades. It took months to get to me but since it came from Thailand and had to pass through customs it was okay. Good thing I was not in a hurry.</li>
    <li> lighter than the original buts works so far</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement for the Atra Plus model that is no longer available in the U.S.; lightweight and easy to carry on trips.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Great price!</li>
    <li> item  was just as described .</li>
    <li> works just fine. the atra plus cartridges fit perfect. very light weight; feels like disposable.</li>
    <li> This has been my husband&#x27;s favorite razor forever (under different model names). He has tried the newer models, as well as the high end blade types and keeps coming back to this simple model for his tough hair. No longer available in the US?! This came from India- seemingly straight off the shelf as it still had the rupee price sticker on it! Exactly what we were looking for, glad its still available somewhere in the world, and thankful to Amazon for connecting us!</li>
    <li> Hope it lasts. Mechanism to hold cartidge flimsy</li>
    <li> You have to receive an item to rate it and I have not got mine in the mail yet. This is taking far to long to get.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described !</li>
    <li> Good Item for the price</li>
    <li> The gillette shaver handle that I order did not fit my atra blade razor some body from the company did not try it.I would like to send it  back or refund my money.Please help me out ,according to the information it will fit gillitte atra plus or gillette trac 11 but not even one of them works.</li>
    <li> came fairly quick from overseas- its plastic, and is WAY lighter than the  genuine metal atra handle I swiped from my dad when I started shaving back in the 1980s...  but it works and i think its a good deal</li>
    <li> This is made of plastic. It fits ATRA blades, but you can SAVE a lot by buying from DORCO USA, their Pace Comfort blades cost a half but as good as ATRA. Don&#x27;t overpay if you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> Good service, good device.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a metal razor. The plastic ones are no stable</li>
    <li> price fits the product, cheaply made</li>
    <li> It does the job but is a nuisance to put together. For the money it is satisfactory. I would recommend it to anyone who uses this type of blade shaving.</li>
    <li> Not as sturdy as we thought it would be, but gets the job done. We appreciate you getting it to us.</li>
    <li> While the delivery was a problem, the device works well and I am happy to have purchased it.</li>
    <li> My husband hates this razor. He tells me the blades do not fit correctly. He said it does not compare to the original atra plus razor that is not longer available (or at least we can not find one).  He had used atra razors for the past 10+ years, but this razor made him switch to a different brand.</li>
    <li> After searching for months, finding one still on earth is reason for rating. I had so many refils, The newer razors just didn&#x27;t do as well as this one. None of the razors fit.</li>
    <li> It is similar to the old Gilette  Atra razor which no longer has refills so if one still wants a double blade it is a good replacement</li>
    <li> Fiine. can&#x27;t believe it came from Thaiand.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only a razor. Does what it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do&#x27;t take it to bed with me, ok?</li>
    <li> The item was received as promised.</li>
    <li> It worked perfect and we now can use all the old blades! It did take quite awhile to get here but it works! Worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Great handle for using Atra cartridges.  Not solid metal like my 1980&#x27;s Atra handle, but great for traveling.  The release button was very stiff so I used some electric razor oil and eventually it broke in AOK.</li>
    <li> it doies not fit the Gillette Atra Plus razor blades.</li>
    <li> I got this for my atra plus blades, but they don&#x27;t fit on them.  Will have to go seen another close shaving system as options to seem to exist any more :(</li>
    <li> Great taste, less filling.</li>
    <li> Low cost razor that nicked me up inspite being careful.</li>
    <li> Lucky to find this as I had lots of blades and lost razor on business trip - do not sell in USA anymore and blades will soon be hard to find I imagine</li>
    <li> had some left over Atra blades with no razor and this worked perfectly.  a little cheaply made but it works.</li>
    <li> The razor fit the Atra replacement cartridges, but the razor is plastic so not as sturdy as the older models.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a placement for my original atra plus razor.  This is cheap and lightweith plastic compared to the chrome stainless.  I threw this in the bottom of the sink cabinet (for emergency and bought the heavyweight stainless atra compatible handle available here on Amazon.  Much better.</li>
    <li> Does not fit Trac II slide-in blades, only clip - ons</li>
    <li> Kind of a light weight cheapie handle, but it does fit the Atra blades I had in abundance.  So at least I&#x27;ll get to use those and not waste them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery etc went off without a hitch.</li>
    <li> Bought this handle so I could use a very large number of Atra and Atra plus cartridges I inherited.  The order took two weeks to arrive which is not bad since it came from the other side of the globe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit my Atra&#x27;s perfectly.  The handle is light plastic with the clip and retainer which holds on the cartridge being metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fully satisfied, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought the razor because I found many unused blades. It works great and the replacement blades are a lot cheaper than other shaving systems.</li>
    <li> This item does not fit the Atra Plus Razor Blade refill cartridges as it says it does, right in the title of the product. I was very disappointed. Plus, I had ordered three of these handles and only one arrived. I would not recommend this product unless you actually have a Gillette Vector. But UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS VENDOR!</li>
    <li> This is a terrible handle - cheap and doesn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t buy from this seller!</li>
    <li> Ordered wrong razor. Will do until I order the one I want.</li>
    <li> Some how the wrong razor was delivered to me, I have about 50 Twin ii Plus blades....</li>
    <li> As expected and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Great shave for a heavy beard, don&#x27;t know why it was discontinued.</li>
    <li> I remembered how good this was when it used to be sold in the US.  I was surprised to see that it could still be had overseas, so I bought one.  After using it, I suppose I remembered it to be better than it really was; the newer blades are actually better.</li>
    <li> I Purchased blades in 2014  Never l;ocated a handle for them..Searched on computer and found the handle....&lt;br /&gt;NO Wallmart or Target store in this area could not understand my problem with the Atra Blades..&lt;br /&gt;The stores have many Atra blades but no Handle for them.&lt;br /&gt;Still using my first blade after 2 weeks still making good shaves.....Max</li>
    <li> No problems the Gillette Vector Fits Atra Plus Razor Blade Refill Cartridge Shaver Handle was ok.  Not much more to say.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised - works with Atra blades</li>
    <li> My original Atra handle, after 33 1/2 years, failed on me -- the head fell off the handle.  Darn, should have bought two in the summer of 1980.  The replacement shaver handle is very, very light.  I just don&#x27;t get the same shave with this handle -- even with the same blades -- as the metal handle.  Must have to do with the mass &amp; weight of the handle.  I&#x27;ll keep this as an emergency backup while I use a variety of super-glues and metal epoxys to keep the 33 year old metal handle going.</li>
    <li> Thought I&#x27;d buy an old razor system to save my self some money. It works but the cartridges don&#x27;t last but a day or two. Unless you like razor burn...</li>
    <li> I had my old Atra razor handle for 20 years before one of the connector tangs broke, and it wouldn&#x27;t hold the disposable razor any longer.  This was right after I bought a new pack of disposable razor heads.  Too bad Gillette abandoned the US market, as I had to resort to ordering one from India.  However this product was absolutely perfect.  Updated handle, it still had the swivel head, and worked like a charm.  I would recommend this seller to anyone who is looking to replace their old handle, or even their new one.  This Vector handle is the updated replacement for the old Gillette.  I even got a chuckle when I noticed the price was marked down on the package (in Rupees)!  Thanks again</li>
    <li> good quality, but took well over the allotted time to ship.</li>
    <li> My original cartridge handle was all aluminum. This product is plastic and a seems almost too flexible. Even more flexible than the similar throw away plastic all-in-one shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was difficult to install a new cartridge--just would not stay on. Either one side or the other would pop off either of the two small hooks. Finally got it on and so far appears to be working adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just not the same as my old one which lasted for 20 odd years.</li>
    <li> This razor handle does exactly what I needed at a reasonable price.  I didn&#x27;t suspect it would arrive from Thailand.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and it was delivered much sooner than expected, and the price was very easonable</li>
    <li> does not fit Atra blades -- takes weeks to arrive</li>
    <li> This Gillette Vector Shaver Handle cost me about $6.70 to provide me with a handle to use up some old Atra blades.  It has a little different type of blade holder catch that is hard to attach, but it will let me use up the blades I bought in the last century.  Then I&#x27;ll keep it as an antique to show off to the unborn generation coming up if my kids have any of their own.</li>
    <li> My Atra Plus Razor Handle was actually stolen out of a shower facility I was visiting. I left it in the shower and when I returned, it was gone. Go figure. I ordered a replacement off Amazon and it worked for a while, then broke. (Cheaper material.) I&#x27;ll never have one like the original one. I&#x27;d had it since the early 90&#x27;s. It was made of stainless steel and was indestructable. I ordered this Vector because the Atra Plus blades fit in it. It works fine. Excellent seller!!!</li>
    <li> The was received much earlier than promised and the price was right. This is not nearly as study as the original Atra handle, but it is is still well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Deserves 0 stars.  The razor head arrived defective.  Cheap plastic as well.  Spend the additional $15 or so dollars and purchase a nice metal one instead.  They are hard to find but they are out there.</li>
    <li> This thing is cheap, but fine for the price I paid for it.  It looks to me like the seller buys these in India off the shelf at a local store for about a buck, then sells them through Amazon for a couple of bucks plus the international shipping.  Can&#x27;t blame them for making a buck. The packaging looked look like it had been through a war when I got it, but the item was fine inside.  The blade that came with it was not great, but it does fit the regular Atra blades and works fine.  It is very light so it would make a good travel razor.</li>
    <li> The handle fit the blades I have. I can&#x27;t say how long it will last, it is made of plastic and is light weight,&lt;br /&gt;but what more can you expect for an item that only cost a few dollars. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> it works great I like it</li>
    <li> It is Okay, but it is not sturdier and I think it needs tender care to make it last&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this. But it did take a long time for delivery.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if the Vector would substitute for the Atra but was pleasantly surprised at how good it works.  Takes a little while to have it arrive but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Exact duplicate of the venerable Atra razor sold for years in the US.&lt;br /&gt;Re-branded for overseas markets as a Vector, but otherwise identical.&lt;br /&gt;However, the product shown was a gray/black color scheme, but the one I received was yellow and light gray.&lt;br /&gt;Be specific if you order from this vendor; better, get assurances via an email before purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it ships from India.</li>
    <li> The prongs that hold the blade stopped functioning in less than a month.</li>
    <li> Took 30 days to arrive, but so do most items that come 1/2 way around the world.  Customs do like hold onto items for a looong time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent handle for all the blades I&#x27;ve kept.  Just as I expected, nice to have a smooth shave once again!</li>
    <li> Great Handle for ATRA.  Does everything I wanted.  Price was good too.</li>
    <li> Its the best on the market.</li>
    <li> i was worried it would not work for my slide-on blades because the picture showed snap-on attachment points, but it did work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent, hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> price is great, customer service was better, delivered before delivery day, great product.</li>
    <li> Quickly shipped; Decent price.</li>
    <li> With the constantly changing shaving blades and handles, telling us we need 4-leaf blades and 5-leaf blades, you would wonder how on earth did we manage to shave before.  I bought the above handle (actually two of them) for my twin sons who finally embraced shaving as they became &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; adult men.  I still have a stockpile of the old twin-leaf blades (Gillette Contour) and this handle fits them perfectly well. Rubberised grip is non-slip, and the handle is much lighter than my own metal one that I&#x27;ve been using for the past 20 years.</li>
    <li> Hard to find razor that accepts the blades my husband buys.  This one works for his blades, so if he&#x27;s happy, I am happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good shave at a decent price for a very long time. I&#x27;ve bought a BUNCH of cheap razors and blades and wasted a lot of money and a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the result of my search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this razor, the \\&quot;Gillette Vector\\&quot; with \\&quot;Personna TWIN PIVOT Plus Cartridges\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now get a GREAT shave at at GREAT price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ALMOST perfect except that the razor is plastic and a LITTLE on the flimsy side. Not bad mind you, but it should have been a little sturdier. that&#x27;s why I gave it fours stars instead of five. I have since ordered 3 more handles and a 100 more Personna Twin Pivot Plus cartridges to go with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste all the time I did if you are looking for a decent shave at a great price.</li>
    <li> We were expecting something like the Atra handle this was bought to replace. Instead, this is cheap, plastic, and will likely break soon. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> not exactly the same size and weight as original issue ,but it is an acceptable replacement as I am unable fo find original atra razor anywhere</li>
    <li> These razor are second only to the Gillette Sensor.  I have found the Gillette Sensor to be the finest razor and blade that I have ever used in more than 40 years of shaving!</li>
    <li> As described, 100% satisfied</li>
    <li> I had an Atra handle that broke, and a supply of Atra cartridges to use up. Since Atra handles are no longer sold in the US, I bought this razor. It did not fit the Atra cartridges and could not be made to fit them. I tried using this razor with the blade that came with it. The blade was so terrible that it left me bleeding across a large patch of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this purchase is that it was cheap, so I didn&#x27;t waste much money.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a heavy razor for my son&#x27;s first shaving experience.  This is very light and probably just plastic.  The price was right but it is not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m sorry i threw out my steel sensor razor handle. this feels like a throwaway. i bought this because&lt;br /&gt;i mistakenly purchased ATRA BLADES not knowing GILLETTE discontinued the razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a light plastic but sturdy.  I expect it to last at least a year or so.  I can&#x27;t find any ATRA razors and that&#x27;s my favorite blade.  So this works fine.</li>
    <li> Product shipped promptly. The handles are a little on cheap side but it&#x27;s one of the few things out there that fits my blades.</li>
    <li> Do not, under any circumstances, order this Vector razor. I bought a bunch of Atra compatible cartridges and, when my Atra razor broke after 2 decades of reliable service six months ago, I tried replacing it with this one. It shipped from India and took weeks. While the stamps on the package were pretty, this razor was flimsy. Worse, after less than six months use, it just broke. It won&#x27;t grasp the cartridges anymore. Find a different option.</li>
    <li> It had been getting hard to find inexpensive blades and then my original Gillette handle broke. Tragedy! Would I have to give up my beloved for over twenty years favorite grooming tool? It was no longer in U.S. stores! Yikes! I felt I was doomed to switch. In desperation I took a chance and searched online. Lo and behold, there was my beloved razor, but only available overseas or as an import. Curse you, Gillette! If it&#x27;s a good enough product to sell overseas, then sell it here! Sheesh! Fortunately, I discovered I could order the &amp;#34;Vector,&amp;#34; an almost exact copy of my original Atra Plus (which I had gotten in the Silhouette version with case), for probably less than I paid for it all those years ago stateside. The only drawback is the blade release catch on the handle is positioned such that the cover of my old Silhouette case will not close over it. Otherwise the Vector performs beautifully and I can continue to shave as I have for over twenty years. Huzzah! By the way, there are plenty of places overseas from which to order inexpensive blades that fit the handle as well.</li>
    <li> nice but they must have put it on a slow boat to china, russia, europe, the middle east, south america, mexico and then to me....</li>
    <li> Once the blade needs to be changed, the razor is no good. Terrible waste of money!</li>
    <li> I was attempting to purchase an Atra and /or Trac II razor as I have an abundance of the cartridges.  What they sent was the Gillette Vector which is not compatible with  my cartridges.</li>
    <li> The razor in nice enough but, it claims to fit Atra cartridges, that is not true. While the razor worked fine with the cartridge it came with it will not fit American Atra cartridges and is therefore worthless to an American. Save your money</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> Very basic Inexpensive handle feels great easy to use and does the job perfectly,</li>
    <li> Okay, so here&#x27;s the deal with these...initially, I was kinda opposed to these. I used them with just plain &#x27;ol soap and water, which is what I usually use to shave. And these bad boys cut me up pretty good. I have to say though, that I have moderately sensitive skin from daily shaving and I am a bleeder. But since I bought quite a few of these I gave it another shot; this time with shaving gel instead of the latter. And I&#x27;m pleased to say, they worked much better. Keeping in mind that these are much older than shavers on the market today and that shaving technology has moved light-years beyond these as a result. But if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative to disposable razors these aren’t half bad.</li>
    <li> This plastic razor is not like the Gillette razors I remember in balance, heft, and durability. But it gets the job done better than all the disposables out there. It also accepts Dollar Store blades, at less than $5 for a five-pack. That makes the Vector well worth its own price of $5, which included shipping from India.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because it fits, not only Vector, but Atra and Atra Plus blades. You can still buy the Atra blades at Wal-Mart here in the U.S. -- but the handles are no longer sold and have been discontinued. I ordered this Vector from India through Amazon. It&#x27;s awesome. I bought some Atra Plus blades at Wal-Mart, but for now I&#x27;m using the Vector blade that came with this. Both the Vector and the Atra blades give a better shave than the Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, or anything else Gillette is pushing right now.</li>
    <li> The Vector is lighter than I like. It almost feels like a disposable. I have a bunch of Atra blades that I wanted to use up, but needed a handle that fits. The Atra blades are not nearly as good as the Sensor. Every morning is a bloodbath. I&#x27;m just too cheap to toss them and Sensor blades are too hard to find.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for the outrageously priced sensor razor.  I&#x27;m very happy.  Performs well and is light weight.</li>
    <li> Product is as expected good!</li>
    <li> I bought for my dad to replace his original.  He loves it except it&#x27;s plastic now instead of metal.  I bought two though!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my dad, as he stockpiled Atra blades, but lost his handle. The blades have purpose again, as this handle works perfectly. It&#x27;s a handle, so it pretty much sells itself. Just know that this a great way to get all those blades you have sitting around used up in a cheap way.</li>
    <li> Great replacements for my Atra handles.</li>
    <li> I was amazed the thing could arrive so fast from India. The product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I think this was a great find, fit the razor handle just fine. They are great little blades and made my husband happy, the razon is his. I woud recommend these to anyone with the same type of handle.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for $1.68, and free shipping.</li>
    <li> This Gillette shaver handle came from India. It was packed very well and arrived quickly and in a very good condition. The refills fit perfectly.  I can purchase the refills here in Hawaii but I cannot get the Shaver Handles.  I was very pleased and recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Blades in the stores do NOT fit this although the write up on this razor states they do.</li>
    <li> My husband is satisfied. That&#x27;s the aim</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, thanks.</li>
    <li> Prompt, good service, and it will match the older Gillette twin blade razors, guys and don&#x27;t get concerned about the plastic handle.  Also, it seems that I was a bit reluctant to buy from Thailand, but the service as great.  The older black plastic one that I used for about 20-25 years served me well, and if this one lasts half as long as that, and I believe it will, then I&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
