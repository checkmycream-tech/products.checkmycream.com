      <li>its amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the La Prairie line and thought I&#x27;d splurge on a cleanser.  </li>
      <li>The best products  Was delivered fast</li>
      <li>I have been using it for many years, and my skin feels good after using it.</li>
      <li>My face never felt so clean or looked so good.</li>
      <li>ive used it for 3 months and my skin is soooo much better in terms of texture and tone.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Great gentle cleanser.</li>

      <li>I do love it, Not the price.</li>
      <li>So glad to have.  </li>
      <li>Love the feeling of cleanness and freshness.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is STRONG.  </li>
      <li>Everything was perfect except the lipstick that they sent a similar one, but not the real Tiger Eye.</li>
      <li>It is rich and creamy and may not help for the oils in your skin.  </li>
      <li>Quick ship-just as described.</li>
      <li>I love it and have not found anything else that will take all makeup off, including eye makeup, with one wash, and have your skin be soft and perfectly clean afterwards.</li>

      <li>Purity is also nice, but this is better in my judgement because again, you need so little</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny....</li>
      <li>Well worth the money as all La Prairie products are.</li>
      <li>Oh, please completely wash away this product, it is so potent it will sting your eyes.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten much better cleansers for a fraction of the cost derived from natural ingredients and paraben-free.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>The cost is well worth it.</li>
      <li>Other than that, good product.</li>
      <li>so i m glad i found the same thing</li>
      <li>It smells very perfumey.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this cleanser before &amp; really like using it.</li>
      <li>It is gentle and clarifying.</li>
      <li>The only thing comparable to this when it comes to removing makeup quickly without using a cleansing cream or cleansing oil is MAC towelettes.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>The tiny drop goes a long way - do not have to use lots of it to clean your slin completely.</li>
      <li>I really think the one I got was not very authentic because the product was very watery.</li>
      <li>I also use another gentle face cleanser that is less costly.</li>

<li> LaPrairie is expensive, but you only need to use a pea size amount for your whole face and you won&#x27;t break out from it either.</li>
<li> You use much less of this product than other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried so it actually costs me less in the long run.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I mean STING YOUR EYES.  </li>
<li> I have been using La Mer for years, but got tired of it.  </li>
<li> It was watery and very bad</li>
<li> but the fragrance is awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price.  So glad to have.  Great gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> great product, i love la prairie. i got this wash as part of a laprairie trial package. its amazing. im almost running out of the trial size  ive used it for 3 months and my skin is soooo much better in terms of texture and tone. so i m glad i found the same thing</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the La Prairie line and thought I&#x27;d splurge on a cleanser.  I don&#x27;t think it is worth the money.  It contains dyes and parabens and feels like you are washing your face with a detergent.  I&#x27;ve gotten much better cleansers for a fraction of the cost derived from natural ingredients and paraben-free.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best foam cleansers available.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. This product will temporarily make your wrinkles disappear. That&#x27;s why it feels so &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; on the skin. I actually like the feeling of tautness. Well worth the money as all La Prairie products are.</li>
    <li> Does t seem to have the quality of LA Prairie products</li>
    <li> The best products  Was delivered fast</li>
    <li> Great cleanser but the fragrance is awful.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this cleanser cleans my face and leaves my skin smooth and free from dryness.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years and I love it.  I have very sensitive skin and I pair this with their scrub.  My face never felt so clean or looked so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser before &amp; really like using it. It works for my skin &amp; I will probably buy it again later</li>
    <li> This was not reall It was watery and very bad</li>
    <li> Quick ship-just as described. Worth every penny....one happy buyer!</li>
    <li> This is a luxury cleanser. I have been using it for many years, and my skin feels good after using it.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect except the lipstick that they sent a similar one, but not the real Tiger Eye.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used. It is gentle and clarifying. If my face is red or irritated this cleanser calms it down. All La Prairie products are amazing but their cleaner is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Love the feeling of cleanness and freshness. It does not try out your skin and is best for oily/combo skin type. The tiny drop goes a long way - do not have to use lots of it to clean your slin completely.</li>
    <li> I have been using La Mer for years, but got tired of it.  Now, this product clears the skin.  It definitely feels hydrated after its use. So, I dont have to run to lotion or night cream afterwards.  The fragrance is STRONG.  It smells very perfumey.  Also, if you have oily skin, you may want to stay away from this product.  It is rich and creamy and may not help for the oils in your skin.  I have combo skin, so this product works great.  Another thing, I think this product has dyes and such in it, so be careful if you are looking for something completely hypoallergenic.  Oh, please completely wash away this product, it is so potent it will sting your eyes.  I mean STING YOUR EYES.  Other than that, good product.</li>
    <li> I really think the one I got was not very authentic because the product was very watery. I didn&#x27;t realize it until I used the one my mom bought from the department store.</li>
    <li> The cost is well worth it. You use much less of this product than other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried so it actually costs me less in the long run. Using it twice a day, it lasts about six months for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using LaPrairie Foam cleanser for years. I love it and have not found anything else that will take all makeup off, including eye makeup, with one wash, and have your skin be soft and perfectly clean afterwards. For comparison, I&#x27;ve used Lancôme, Estée Lauder, Clinique, Aveda, and Sisley, not to mention several drug store brands. The only thing comparable to this when it comes to removing makeup quickly without using a cleansing cream or cleansing oil is MAC towelettes. Purity is also nice, but this is better in my judgement because again, you need so little and it does it in one wash. LaPrairie is expensive, but you only need to use a pea size amount for your whole face and you won&#x27;t break out from it either. It also works well with a cleansing device (Clarsonic). I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> If you can afford it . there is nothing better thana LaPrarie cleanser. I also use another gentle face cleanser that is less costly.</li>
    <li> I like the softness of the cream. I do love it, Not the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Does what it says.  Is not much different than Chanel&#x27;s, Sheseido, or Estée Lauder.</li>
