      <li>nice but make sure</li>
      <li>perfect for enhancing a smaller bust</li>
      <li>These are ok they were with a adhesive</li>
      <li>love them fit so nice</li>
      <li>I am looking for better quality.</li>
      <li>they work okay at doing that.  </li>
      <li>The sticky backs allow them to stay stuck to the breast and not slide around inside your top.</li>

      <li>They are also very easy to clean with mild soap and warm water.</li>

      <li>If you need to increase your bust try \\&quot;Original looks bra</li>
      <li>the original invisi that i&#x27;d seen is a bra like or breastlike  held together as one.  </li>
      <li>this bra insert is not an original invisi.  </li>
      <li>I like said about Item being reviewed   Original Invisi Silicone Bra Inserts ~ Size C ~</li>
      <li>Spend your money on something that is not only better quality but more body-friendly!</li>
      <li>When I received them in my mailbox I knew there was a problem because the package was way too light to have what I was expecting in it, If your looking for smooth backless, strapless bra cups, that look nude under see through clothing and if your skin color happens to match the color, this may be just right for you.</li>
      <li>to always incase in some ziplock are something and keep in cool area the material gets sticky in heat .This</li>
      <li>/&gt;i wash them in cool water with baby shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>ok , so these work , but the stick wears off way too fast.  </li>
      <li>good product, packaged and shipped properly.</li>
      <li>i found they were slightly pointed but looks pretty natural in halter styled swimsuit great for feeling good the beach</li>
      <li>the tray is crappy, its just super then plastic that crunches up if something hits it under the sink cupboard.  </li>
      <li>I found this product to be very comfortable to wear and the look is very natural.  </li>
      <li>My lovely new suit had everything I was looking for except a flattering bust line.  </li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast, they came in about 4 days.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i just wish the tray was thicker plastic, and that the product actually boosted me up a whole cup size to really fill out my larger old bras, while im having to wear them since i cant afford to replace them all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, customer service for these guys, they are awesome.  </li>
      <li>The material itself is fine, but just not enough of it to matter.  </li>
      <li>No, they are not perfect but they are very good.  </li>
      <li>but I was very dissapointed when I opened the box.</li>
      <li>(I ordered two) crammed into my 6x6 mail box in nothing more than a manila envelope and with nothing but the flimsy plastic crushed into the inserts.</li>
      <li>The item shipped quite fast</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t confuse these with Original Looks bra inserts, They are not the same.</li>
      <li>a little more effort on packaging and shipping could improve the first impression.</li>
      <li>The texture and flexibility is a little more like rubber than silicone.</li>
      <li>It makes me look whole and natural.</li>
      <li>keeps them clean and once dry, sticky again.  </li>
      <li>NEW  </li>
      <li>I took the plastic off to insert them into a new bra that I also purchased off amazon and noticed that the gel inserts were covered in some form of sticky adhesive (on both sides).</li>
      <li>sent the seller a message before writing this review and they are sending me a brand new one, and not asking for an exhange (since I need to use them before the new ones will arrive.)</li>
      <li>I very highly recommend you at least give them a try before you spend more.</li>
      <li>They were not even silicone filled just a cheap thin material.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on these!</li>
      <li>YOU NEED TO BUY SEVERAL PAIRS TO REALLY FILL OUT A \\&quot;C\\&quot; CUP AND GIVE REALISTIC CLEAVAGE.</li>
      <li>First off if your looking for a set of inserts that make your breast look bigger and that feel soft and natural, this is not it!</li>
      <li>There were no instructions, no title even on the box (just clear plastic wrapped gel inserts).</li>
      <li>plus the clear cling on sheets to protect the sticky while they are put away, and</li>
      <li>/&gt;They were sent in a manilla envelope, so the plastic container that the inserts are stored in was warped and nearly unusable.</li>
      <li>Three, you better get it right the first time because they are extremely difficult to move even a little bit.  </li>
      <li>i figured it was cheaper to purchase a set of falsies to fill in the bigger bras, than to buy all new bras at once.  </li>
      <li>Not as large as expected in a size &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>They were very slippery and slip right out from the bra which is NOT good.  </li>
      <li>It IS a extremely thin silicone shell with adhesive backing intended to be worn on the breast (with such tiny enhancement it could only be evident on lower elementary children.)  </li>
      <li>I had to sit down very quickly,run to the bathroom and take them both off.</li>
      <li>Never having used such before I was a little befuddled, and I don&#x27;t think it is all due to my advanced age.</li>
      <li>First off let me point out that there are little snaps (I just learned are for clevage enhancement) and sticky backs to these inserts, obviously not advertised.</li>
      <li>but they are very sticky and hurt a little when I remove them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve have used many inserts and for the price, how can you really say anything bad?  </li>

<li> so im slowly getting new bras at the right cup size, and in the mean time also wearing the older bigger cups with these to help me fill them in.  </li>
<li> These are more like a very firm, thin, smooth set of small bra cups, and the clips that are supposed to hook them together in the middle were cut off of mine, however, I&#x27;ve  read in one of the other reviews that theirs were intact.</li>
<li> They also didn&#x27;t seem sticky enough to stay on for a long period of time when worn alone, which may be why the clips have been removed and they are being marketed as inserts rather than a bra.</li>
<li> Second off I expected them to arrive in a box via UPS of FEDEX</li>
<li> I have used a similar product before, and the only down side to these in comparison is that they don&#x27;t have a hook to clip them together for added clevage.</li>
<li> i just let them hover over the cups as they air dry in the tray after washing to prevent anything like dush from getting onto them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> TOO BAD AND FEEL PRETTY MUCH LIKE A BREAST BUT</li>
<li> so I just wanted a little bounce back.</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected they were like rubber stickers  </li>
<li> but it fills the empty space where a piece of me was lost.</li>
<li> OTHER THAN THAT</li>
<li> i bought these because ive been loosing weight and my bra cup size has gone down.  </li>
<li> One of the previous reviews said they come with clips so you can clip them together for cleavage if you&#x27;re wearing something backless, mine came with no clips but the plastic tabs were still there as if someone just cut the clip part off.</li>
<li> It was a quality product, just not true to size.</li>
<li> I ordered these because I have just weaned my little girl from nursing and am anticipating my breasts shrinking.</li>
<li> I purchased these inserts for a little lift.</li>
<li> It felt like taking a raw piece of steak and putting it into your bra.</li>
<li> These are hard and small, they add maybe half a cup.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t need it but it fills the empty space where a piece of me was lost. It makes me look whole and natural.</li>
    <li> These were NOT what was shown in the picture.  They were not even silicone filled just a cheap thin material.  They were very slippery and slip right out from the bra which is NOT good.  And I have no way of returning them.  They gave me no return slip of any kind.  Do not waste your money on these!</li>
    <li> great way to where a topless shirt and came in quick!! this is a great idea and I am glad i found it at a great price</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I have just weaned my little girl from nursing and am anticipating my breasts shrinking. My wedding is this summer and I have already ordered my dress, and I have another formal event in which I already have a dress. I bought these to avoid needing alterations done to my dresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were sent in a manilla envelope, so the plastic container that the inserts are stored in was warped and nearly unusable. And one of the inserts had fallen out during shipping and was stuck to the bottom of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent the seller a message before writing this review and they are sending me a brand new one, and not asking for an exhange (since I need to use them before the new ones will arrive.) I am very very pleased with their customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works well. The sticky backs allow them to stay stuck to the breast and not slide around inside your top. They are also very easy to clean with mild soap and warm water. I have used a similar product before, and the only down side to these in comparison is that they don&#x27;t have a hook to clip them together for added clevage. I don&#x27;t need it, though, so it&#x27;s not an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I do like them and they will serve their purpose just fine.</li>
    <li> i found they were slightly pointed but looks pretty natural in halter styled swimsuit great for feeling good the beach</li>
    <li> Not happy.  this item is poorly packaged -- see other reviews -- but not damaged.  I was also called.  They suggested that I return them for credit, and that was nice.  The problem is several in nature.  One, they are so thin as to be useless.  Two, the inside backing is so sticky that it is painful to remove.  Painful.  Three, you better get it right the first time because they are extremely difficult to move even a little bit.  The material itself is fine, but just not enough of it to matter.  I also bought the Invisilooks, and they are perfect.</li>
    <li> i bought these because ive been loosing weight and my bra cup size has gone down.  i figured it was cheaper to purchase a set of falsies to fill in the bigger bras, than to buy all new bras at once.  so im slowly getting new bras at the right cup size, and in the mean time also wearing the older bigger cups with these to help me fill them in.  they work okay at doing that.  they work great in the new cup bras to give me awesome cleavage.  found that out one sleepy morning getting dressed and just going through the motions, not paying attention, and putting them on with a bra that is my size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wash them in cool water with baby shampoo.  keeps them clean and once dry, sticky again.  the tray is crappy, its just super then plastic that crunches up if something hits it under the sink cupboard.  but its what they come in and what i have to keep them in, has a lid to keep dust off of them too.  plus the clear cling on sheets to protect the sticky while they are put away, and i just let them hover over the cups as they air dry in the tray after washing to prevent anything like dush from getting onto them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just wish the tray was thicker plastic, and that the product actually boosted me up a whole cup size to really fill out my larger old bras, while im having to wear them since i cant afford to replace them all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw, customer service for these guys, they are awesome.  they called me and addressed my problems with the product and we came to an understanding.  they are going to do what they can to improve things.  and they made me happy.</li>
    <li> these are great and they do just what I wanted them to do. I received them a lot faster than I thought I would.</li>
    <li> First off if your looking for a set of inserts that make your breast look bigger and that feel soft and natural, this is not it! These are more like a very firm, thin, smooth set of small bra cups, and the clips that are supposed to hook them together in the middle were cut off of mine, however, I&#x27;ve  read in one of the other reviews that theirs were intact. The texture and flexibility is a little more like rubber than silicone. This should be advertised as a bra, not inserts. These are hard and small, they add maybe half a cup. Please don&#x27;t confuse these with Original Looks bra inserts, They are not the same. When I received them in my mailbox I knew there was a problem because the package was way too light to have what I was expecting in it, If your looking for smooth backless, strapless bra cups, that look nude under see through clothing and if your skin color happens to match the color, this may be just right for you. They also didn&#x27;t seem sticky enough to stay on for a long period of time when worn alone, which may be why the clips have been removed and they are being marketed as inserts rather than a bra. If you need to increase your bust try \\&quot;Original looks bra inserts\\&quot;. I returned these and the customer service person was very courteous and understanding, she offered a refund, not a credit,I was very pleased about that. Shipping was very fast, they came in about 4 days.</li>
    <li> First off let me point out that there are little snaps (I just learned are for clevage enhancement) and sticky backs to these inserts, obviously not advertised. Second off I expected them to arrive in a box via UPS of FEDEX instead I find them both (I ordered two) crammed into my 6x6 mail box in nothing more than a manila envelope and with nothing but the flimsy plastic crushed into the inserts. Third off I was invited to write a review, which I did, but then I was called by a deals in motion sales somebody who \\&quot;Took it personal\\&quot; that I didnt call and adress the problem before making the review and to please erase it. So let me just say that if I hadnt needed them so bad for my halloween costume I would have sent them back and that the product isnt that bad but a little more effort on packaging and shipping could improve the first impression.</li>
    <li> No information with them as how to make the best utilization of them.&lt;br /&gt;Also they are so sticky. Never having used such before I was a little befuddled, and I don&#x27;t think it is all due to my advanced age.</li>
    <li> this bra insert is not an original invisi.  the original invisi that i&#x27;d seen is a bra like or breastlike  held together as one.  the piece that held it as one was cut -off.</li>
    <li> The product by Invisi, advertised to be \\&quot;a silicone bra insert\\&quot; . . . is NOT. It IS a extremely thin silicone shell with adhesive backing intended to be worn on the breast (with such tiny enhancement it could only be evident on lower elementary children.)  This does me absolutely NO GOOD since I have breast cancer and needed it to fill in my bra cup on the side that was removed! The photo appeared to be what I have bought in the past and I received a cartoon image in comparison. It&#x27;s bad enough to have the physical problem without the insult of bad advertising and photo representation!</li>
    <li> I purchased these inserts for a little lift. I am a C-Cup so I just wanted a little bounce back. The item shipped quite fast but I was very dissapointed when I opened the box. There were no instructions, no title even on the box (just clear plastic wrapped gel inserts). I took the plastic off to insert them into a new bra that I also purchased off amazon and noticed that the gel inserts were covered in some form of sticky adhesive (on both sides). If I put the insert into my bra it would stick perfectly to the bra but it would also adhere itself to my skin which was very uncomfortable. The adhesive wasn&#x27;t even that strong. It felt like taking a raw piece of steak and putting it into your bra. Ladies...beware....Spend your money on something that is not only better quality but more body-friendly!</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very comfortable to wear and the look is very natural.  I was leary about buying them thinking people would notice, but after wearing them for months, even I forget I am wearing them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have used many inserts and for the price, how can you really say anything bad?  No, they are not perfect but they are very good.  I very highly recommend you at least give them a try before you spend more.</li>
    <li> perfect for enhancing a smaller bust</li>
    <li> very happy with these but they are very sticky and hurt a little when I remove them.</li>
    <li> It was a quality product, just not true to size. The C fit more like a B. More like an enhancer...</li>
    <li> Not as large as expected in a size &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;.  They are much smaller than another pair I ordered in the same size from a different company.  They are also not as sturdy-looking and are somewhat disappointing.  I do not recommend these.  I had a lumpectomy several years ago and need some additional support and lift on one side, but these simply do not work in this regard.</li>
    <li> Oh, my goodness...I cought them at about my knees. I had to sit down very quickly,run to the bathroom and take them both off. Good thing it was intermission durring a play and not a party. I followed the instructions.  i will stick duct tape for now.</li>
    <li> ok , so these work , but the stick wears off way too fast.  I am looking for better quality.</li>
    <li> I like said about Item being reviewed   Original Invisi Silicone Bra Inserts ~ Size C ~ NEW  my wife did&#x27;t like look so smale but page look nice thank you</li>
    <li> YOU NEED TO BUY SEVERAL PAIRS TO REALLY FILL OUT A \\&quot;C\\&quot; CUP AND GIVE REALISTIC CLEAVAGE. OTHER THAN THAT THEY AREN&#x27;T TOO BAD AND FEEL PRETTY MUCH LIKE A BREAST BUT NOT TOTALLY. THEY ARE \\&quot;OKAY\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I looked all over to find some inserts that did NOT have raised nipples.  I looked closely at the picture before I ordered them, and yet, when these arrived, they did had the raised nipples.  The website description does not mention the nipples.  I&#x27;m sending them back.  They are different than what is pictured or described.</li>
    <li> Really small to be a size C....</li>
    <li> these r great for cd&#x27;s or trans</li>
    <li> I bouth this for my mom and She said that is ok it fit perfect to her and is ok</li>
    <li> No where in the description does it says the are adhesive to stick to your body and not just be inserted in your bra.  Terrible description and very misleading.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;Does not stay in place&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to say&lt;br /&gt;Would not recom</li>
    <li> fits great, feels great and stays in place. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> not as advertised, the product display does not represent what was sold, I saw same item for 9.99 without postage or handling; this is an over priced rip off</li>
    <li> These are ok they were with a adhesive so I didn&#x27;t like that but they were good for lift. Of good quality</li>
    <li> good product, packaged and shipped properly. I like doing business with this company. I will do it again. yes. yes.</li>
    <li> nice but make sure to always incase in some ziplock are something and keep in cool area the material gets sticky in heat .This looks so real when in inserted inside bra under cloths amazing &#x27;</li>
    <li> love them fit so nice</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected they were like rubber stickers  un useable. I would have returned  it  but I tried to use .AWFUL!</li>
    <li> These are horrible! There is no padding at all so they do nothing for you. One of the previous reviews said they come with clips so you can clip them together for cleavage if you&#x27;re wearing something backless, mine came with no clips but the plastic tabs were still there as if someone just cut the clip part off. Worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made!! I gave it 1 star because no stars wasn&#x27;t an option.</li>
    <li> My lovely new suit had everything I was looking for except a flattering bust line.  These do the trick in making me feel like I wanted to in the suit....SHAPELY!</li>
