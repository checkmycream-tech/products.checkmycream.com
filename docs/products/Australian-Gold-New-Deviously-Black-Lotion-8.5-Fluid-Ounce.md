<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great stuff. Color comes on pretty fast!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion/bronzer. I get great color and coverage with it.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Better results than the &amp;#34;top shelf&amp;#34; brands in my experience. I love the fragance, but its hard to describe. Not the usual fruity fragrance of tanning lotions. Gives a fast, dark, tan!</li>
    <li> Makes you look darker quicker with a nice looking tan!</li>
    <li> Love it great tan, for a great price!</li>
    <li> Good product ... smells nice!</li>
    <li> The product is fine ... But I can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
    <li> Been using these products for years love them all</li>
    <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t morph into the hellish odor of the underworld once you&#x27;ve been in the tanning booth. As far as aiding tanning or even adding a slight bronze -- not so much. You don&#x27;t even have to wash your hands after application so if there&#x27;s bronzer in it, I don&#x27;t see it. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or cause acne if I leave it on after tanning like some products do. Helps with me tan without redness.</li>
    <li> Used it until one I liked better came out!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t smell as fantastic as the other Aus. Gold products, but it isn&#x27;t bad. Probably works the best out of that line that I have tried. Would buy it again. Good price.</li>
    <li> Brilliant product. Bronzers are nice but not too much, never goes streaky</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. I always have to use tingles cause I&#x27;m so fair and freckly. This is the first bronzer I have used and it has given me an amazing tan. It&#x27;s the real thing cause I work at a salon and compared it to the real stuff. Would buy anything and tell anyone don&#x27;t hesitate to buy from this seller..You don&#x27;t have to worry you will be happy with product.</li>
    <li> Have using it for 3 years now an always give me a great looking tan I love it ;)</li>
    <li> Great lotion for the price!  Will definitely purchase it again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! I will get another bottle when Im out!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get me as dark as I thought it would</li>
    <li> Love it for sunbed tanning and better value and price than what the tanning salon charges.... PS I am a member of Palm Beach and their prices are outrageous for product....</li>
    <li> luv the lotion...works and  smells great</li>
    <li> Great tan very quickly!! I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I love Australian Gold products, not very heavy, smells delicious and def does the job! nice &amp; golden :)</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion for inside tanning as well as outside.  Goes on well and absorbs quickly, the fragrance is not overwhelming.  The fragrance reminds me of tropical fruit and flowers.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer for my beautiful bronze body of a god! I love to rub it all over my body yum yum!</li>
    <li> Great product at great price! Will buy it again. Definitely pushed my tan to new standard.</li>
    <li> Awesome, I love it more than my previous brand!</li>
    <li> This is a Good lotion for the price! Leaves no after tan smell and  The smell is great!!  I would definitely purchase this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I got good color with first time use !The tanning salon sells this for 30$ n up ,crazy when you can get it on amazon for less than 20$ ! I bought two and when I run out I will be buying more !!</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and this product is a &amp;#34;bottom shelf&amp;#34; lotion since it has basic skin care. However, this is probably one of my favorites I have tried so far. The smell is pleasant and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> A good starter bronzer, but not for experienced tanners. It works good if you use it in a level 4-5 bed. Deff gotta wash your hands after u tan.</li>
    <li> Throw some on jump in a tanning bed and it&#x27;s like instant darkness, at an unbeatable price</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes that it would help me darken my tan.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t really help.  I&#x27;m not impressed and have definitely tried better tanners.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Good basic lotion, not extremely dark results. Would recommend it it is a good buy for the price I think</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Much better than those greasy tanning oils.  Just remember to be careful because there is absolutely zero sun block protection.  If you wear this in the bright sun for long periods of time without applying a sun block at least part of the day you will be sun burned.  Otherwise it definitely seems to give me a darker tan quicker than usual.</li>
    <li> this is for tanning beds and has worked real well for me.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for getting a solid base or even turning a base into something just a bit darker, but you&#x27;ll probably plateau at that point and need something a bit more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background: I&#x27;m Irish and naturally pale with some freckles. I can tan, but it takes effort. So long as I don&#x27;t overdo it, I won&#x27;t burn. When I started, I used minimal SPF (4-6) then moved to an accelerator with bronzer once I had some color going. I switched to Australian Gold&#x27;s Cheeky Brown, which really helped me get a base tan going. After about 3 weeks I switched to this one, Australian Gold&#x27;s Deviously Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 45x bronzers, Deviously Black was definitely stronger than Cheeky Brown. I noticed that I got darker faster, but after about a week and a half with Deviously Black, I feel like I plateaued. The progress got incredibly slow, so slow that it would take three or four tanning sessions before I&#x27;d notice a color difference. People were telling me I was tan, but after my evening shower when I&#x27;d usually notice the difference from that day&#x27;s session, I wasn&#x27;t seeing any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked Deviously Black as it definitely helped me to establish a base tan. To that end, it was successful. However, this is not the lotion that I would use going forward to go from base to dark tan. In other words, Deviously Black is a great stepping-stone, but it&#x27;s not the final stage of tanning; you&#x27;ll need to find something better to break the plateau after this. I&#x27;m probably being a little generous with 4 stars, but I don&#x27;t feel like 3 is quite high enough. As I said, for about a week or more it worked great, but then it stopped and it was time for something stronger, which is when I moved to Precious Metals.</li>
    <li> works great!  It will get your darker. This is also a much better deal to buy on Amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for 12 years or so. This is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve spent a lot on lotions before that didn&#x27;t work and leave the after tan smell. Deviously black not only works great, it smells very nice and the price is so affordable.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than buying it at a tanning salon.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! love it!</li>
    <li> Best ever tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> Great quick color for bothsexes</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I am a frequent tanner, and have been for years. I normally use nothing other than tingle lotions, but decided I needed a change to help break the plateau. Australian Gold products have always been good for me, but this one surpasses them all. Could tell a difference after the 3rd session, and the smell is awesome - just like the beach. Will def buy again.</li>
    <li> I received the Australian Gold super fast! I have been using this product and like it alot. It does promote a tan quicker than I expected!</li>
    <li> This product does wonders overtime, but I definitely got darker the first few times I used it!!! Its just a great product and brand!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is great! Awesome price and smells good.</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion initially at a Tanning Spa and it gave great results in the spa.  Since I no longer believe in Tanning Beds, they started to really age and ruin my skin, BTW; I started using this outdoors, with limited exposure, as there&#x27;s no sunscreen in it.  That&#x27;s fine if you can limit your time outside and you want to get maximum results for the time you do spend outside.  It has what I would call a &amp;#34;unisex&amp;#34; scent to it, which I like too.  For the price on Amazon, which is less than half of what some &amp;#34;spas&amp;#34; charge, mine was charging $25 for the same size, it&#x27;s a steal and I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have used the Australian Gold Black Dawn and Hardcore Black. I tried this because it is sold in my salon and is a 45x. Got good results with Hardcore 30x so I thought I would bump it up. After a few uses my tan was fading. Put on the Hardcore tonight and I already see better results. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Product matched description - updated delivery status -</li>
    <li> Got it for the beach!  Used it once at home and was amazed at how tan I got! Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> Bought it from my tanning place for double the price on Amazon and it does not even work at all. Do not like it and threw bottle away. I do not recommend</li>
    <li> works great much cheaper then in the tan salons</li>
    <li> Got me a nice color after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;smells nice</li>
    <li> It works as it should.</li>
    <li> This lotion gives your skin a beautiful color and moisturizers as well.</li>
    <li> Did not really get any darker using this</li>
    <li> Works great as expected</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff. Works great and the smell is just fine for me.</li>
    <li> It was awesome. Worked really well and the smell is fantastic. Loved it</li>
    <li> Works great. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Price was better than buying at the tanning salon</li>
    <li> Rich, dark color for indoor tanning. Goes on nicely &amp; smells good</li>
    <li> Alright lotion. Got tan but not dark dark tan</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product. I love it. Boost my tan and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. Will order again before I run out!</li>
    <li> Great lotion; works well and is quite affordable.</li>
    <li> Smells good and feels good!</li>
    <li> love it and the smell it great, i got a great tan from it !!!!</li>
    <li> Scent--It&#x27;s alright, nothing special, but it&#x27;s not bad. In my opinion it smells kind of minty.&lt;br /&gt;Results--It was just ok, didn&#x27;t notice much of any color. I&#x27;m already pretty tan, so maybe that&#x27;s the reason. Either way I won&#x27;t be using this lotion again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the 30x tanner before and got good results, this one seems to make the tan come on just a little quicker compared to the 30x one. All in all, smells good, spreads evenly and easily, and it gives a good tan, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love Australian Gold products for tanning at the salon or beach.  I&#x27;ve tried the Sinfully Black (15x) which has a light berry-ish smell, &amp; the Hardcore Black (30x) with a nice more typical &amp;#34;tanning lotion&amp;#34; smell...they both are great, leave your skin feeling good, &amp; give you a deep tan quickly.  Now this time I bought this new Deviously Black lotion (45x).  I think it does give you a darker tan a little quicker than the others.  It is a thick lotion &amp; goes on easily, soaks in quickly, smells great, leaves your skin silky smooth &amp; really does give you a great deep tan fast.  Even when I hit the beach, I put this on 1st &amp; cook for an hour or more, then put on some sunscreen so I don&#x27;t burn under the Florida sun.  That combo gives you an amazingly dark tan too.  I definitely do recommend this Deviously Black.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always trying new indoor tanning lotions. I love this stuff. Smells amazing before AND after tanning. People say I smell like the beach. Just a nice light coconut/flowery sweet smell. No nasty tanning smell. It is thick and creamy and just the right amount of bronzer. Not LOADED with bronzer, but just that perfect amount. This is my second time ordering it and it&#x27;s my go to lotion now.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  For two years I used a much more expensive product when I decided to try this one. First, I want to say that I received this so quickly, I was so surprised. Second, this has really given me the darkest tan I have ever had. Such warm even tan</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
    <li> My Boyfriend really likes the lotion and it bronzes really well.  He thinks it smells to girly for him.</li>
    <li> I only use Australian gold. It gives a nice tan fast. Would highly recommend. It also makes you skin so soft</li>
    <li> Got this super fast was so excited thanks</li>
    <li> A decent lotion from Australian Gold. Not one of my favorites. Will pass it on to someone else.</li>
    <li> I actually really liked it for the money.  Not too perfumey and for a dude the case and smell seemed pretty cool and a very decent tan for the money.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion in the past and had good results. This is a great bronzing lotion and it is half the price from purchasing at the tanning place. So this is a fantastic value!</li>
    <li> Smells good.  Great price.  Provides excellent bronzing.  Good go-to lotion.</li>
    <li> Awesome! !!.....will definitely be a returning customer</li>
    <li> Love the smell and this stuff really works.  It gives me a dark tan in half the time!</li>
    <li> Good product. It took a while for it to be delivered. It was delivered a day after the latest expected date.</li>
    <li> I love it! It is not a bronzer. But it is very effective. I used this lotion for my first time tanning and I am really, really tan.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Leaves skin feeling great and turns you a lovely colour. So much cheaper buying it this way I got 3 bottles for the same price I was paying for one at the salon</li>
    <li> great deal good stuff!</li>
    <li> It works but it seems to leave my skin a little orangish color looking. I don&#x27;t like the smell of it too much.</li>
    <li> Smells great i looove the tropical smell, which suks because it doesnt tan me well at ALL even after 3 weeks! went back to Solid Black lotion and now im dark</li>
    <li> nice lotion but i prefer the australian gold cheeky brown one better</li>
