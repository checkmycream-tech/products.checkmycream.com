      <li>This is an amazing deal.</li>

      <li>Great price, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen smell can be overwhelming at times.  </li>
      <li>Phew, glad me and my friend didn&#x27;t put sunscreen in our hair that night.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>
      <li>My husband, as you might say, is hair challenged on the top of his head.  </li>
      <li>I might use it for sunscreen one day though, since it&#x27;s more that than anything.</li>
      <li>Easy to work with and spread throughout hair and scalp.  </li>
      <li>I keep my hair real short, and ride a motorcycle, and this stuff is great for providing some hold while also protecting my scalp from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AXE</li>
      <li>This is a great product for those that wear their hair very short.</li>
      <li>As a mom of a Italian boy this is great BUT VERY high in price!!</li>
      <li>use it daily, has a nice light smell.  </li>
      <li>I just use it more for weekends or going out not everyday use, lotion is still cheaper!</li>
      <li>Axe is the best and why should i spend $50 and smell like a mature man when i can get this stuff for $4 or less and get the fun girls.</li>
      <li>I like the more natural feeling.</li>
      <li>it rinses right out of hair and scalp</li>
      <li>My hair is cut in a girly long on top and shorter on one side more than the other - kind of like Emelie Sunde of England, but I&#x27;ve had this style for nearly 10 years.</li>
      <li>I am not a &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; guy, or I wasn&#x27;t until I got a big boy job and had to look more presentable - that included using hair product.</li>
      <li>and it looks just like sunscreen, i take some and put it in my hair and it feel exactly as if i&#x27;m putting lotion on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Smells good, girls just compliment me and want me so much i am turning down numbers.</li>
      <li>Since I got it for free definitely 5 star product.</li>
      <li>I really thought Axe started making sunscreen and that i put sunscreen in my hair.  </li>
      <li>It was real slimy when washing it out of my hair.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t really know where to start with hair products.</li>
      <li>keeping it soft and unkinked in hot weather.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to buy a 2 pack for less than that.</li>
      <li>I thought since this was for hair it would have a better smell &amp; different consistency than regular sunscreen, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores lately, so I&#x27;m glad I can stock up via Amazon.</li>
      <li>He spends a lot of time outside in the summer months doing many different activities.  </li>
      <li>Love that I can wash hair, put in the cream, brush down until smooth, then use rake it up and it stays that way, while allowing my short sides stay smoothly laid down.  </li>
      <li>He has thick curly hair and after his shower he put a small amount in and it made it much softer and it smelled good!!</li>
      <li>Well, I have tried a lot of different ones, expensive and cheap; creams, paste, glue.. and by far the Axe Styling Cream (yellow - Buzz Cut) is by far the best.</li>
      <li>A LITTLE LONGER ON TOP...</li>
      <li>I find that its much more useful in created different hair styles, I usually spike, faux hawk, or just a whatever look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a softer hair creme with SPF 15 sunscreen included, which is great for those of us with shortly cut and thin or balding hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not much into the overly powerful deodorants that Unilever puts out under the Axe brand, but this is the one product of theirs I really like.</li>
      <li>I got a free sample of this in an Axe container identical to the one shown above, but just smaller.  </li>
      <li>I really like the way this particular cream smells and the fact that is made especially for guys with buzz cuts.</li>
      <li>the cream is not to heavy not to light and lasts all day</li>
      <li>tell my 11 year old son looked it up...</li>
      <li>NOT HEAVY WASHES OUT</li>
      <li>This one is sticky, and to have it penetrate and protect the scalp (that was the main reason why I bought it for), you need to apply a larger amount, making it even stickier.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for those with short buzzed hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need a heavy hold and it&#x27;s nice to put on if I think I&#x27;ll be outside during of the day since I&#x27;m not much of a hat wearer.</li>
      <li>It is good if you want a styling product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stiff or hard.  </li>
      <li>and I would buy all the time but not worth the High Price!!    </li>
      <li>Soft cream goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Dries dry and flexible, not stiff.</li>

<li> Soft cream goes a long way.  </li>
<li> Dries dry and flexible, not stiff.</li>
<li> Very greasy &amp; white &amp; no particular scent other than chemicals.</li>
<li> but i go on an average on 1 date daily with a new girl every time.</li>
<li> There are other scalp sunscreen products out there that seem to have been developed for hair and scalp protection.</li>
<li> If you have short hair don&#x27;t waste your time with it unless you just like the smell and how soft your hair is.</li>
<li> Went for a walk without anything and ended up with a minor sunburn on my scalp.  </li>
<li> Works for short hair pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Smells weird</li>
<li> WORKS OUTSIDE EVERYDAY, HAS A BRUSH CUT WITH</li>
<li> when wet</li>
<li> I have tried all the other Axe products but nothing comes close to this.</li>
<li> I put a small amount on in the morning and it last all day.</li>
<li> I usually like to keep my haircuts short</li>
<li> Like the other Axe hair products, this is anywhere from half to one third the price of comparable hair gels and cremes, so I&#x27;m not sure where where other reviewers are complaining about price (this is also a two pack as well).</li>
<li> Nothing like saying \\&quot;hey your not worth a $50 cologne\\&quot; then spending $4 on a can of spray.</li>
<li> Holds hair without the sticky mess.</li>
<li> Not sure why other people were saying it didn&#x27;t have a smell or smells like chemicals.</li>
<li> Sits heavy on your hair.</li>
<li> I got a free sample from the gym I go to here on base</li>
<li> Not sure why, but AXE stopped making this product.  </li>
<li> can apply a very small amount rub it through</li>
<li> Nonetheless, it is a very confusing product, Axe is getting too fancy with their mens hair products, we&#x27;re men not women.</li>
<li> I was confused by the product</li>
<li> Not waterproof so the SPF factor is meaningless if you use this as hair and scalp protection at the beach.  </li>
<li> I have wavy hair and it gets freaking crazy after I wash it</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> WORKS OUTSIDE EVERYDAY, HAS A BRUSH CUT WITH A LITTLE LONGER ON TOP...NO ONGER FOUND IN RETAIL STORES (DONT KNOW WHY)  BUT WORKS GREAT TO PROTECT HAIR AND SCALP...NOT HEAVY WASHES OUT</li>
    <li> I had already used this hair product, so I already knew I liked it.  It is good if you want a styling product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stiff or hard.  Each package of styling cream also came with a bonus sample of Axe Shampoo.  Bonus!</li>
    <li> Great products and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this in an Axe container identical to the one shown above, but just smaller.  It says on the front Axe Crew Cut, buzzed look cream with sunscreen.  I opened it up and it looks just like sunscreen, i take some and put it in my hair and it feel exactly as if i&#x27;m putting lotion on my hair.  I never used it after that because i thought i mistakenly put sun screen in my hair.  It was not until now that i googled the axe product and it linked me to this amazon.com page with it saying that it is ment for hair.  Phew, glad me and my friend didn&#x27;t put sunscreen in our hair that night.  Nonetheless, it is a very confusing product, Axe is getting too fancy with their mens hair products, we&#x27;re men not women. If its hair gel/cream say it on the front.  I really thought Axe started making sunscreen and that i put sunscreen in my hair.  Avoid this product, even as hair cream it sucked. I might use it for sunscreen one day though, since it&#x27;s more that than anything.</li>
    <li> My husband, as you might say, is hair challenged on the top of his head.  He spends a lot of time outside in the summer months doing many different activities.  He noticed traditional suntan lotion would wash off when he would perspire or when in the ocean.  This stuff works wonders for those with not a lot of hair, having a head that tends to burn, and doesn&#x27;t sweat off.  He read this idea in Mens Health and it works wonders for keeping the head from peeling after being in the sun.  I can&#x27;t speak for the benefits of styling hair only as a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended for those with short buzzed hair.  Went for a walk without anything and ended up with a minor sunburn on my scalp.  Looked into hair cream/gel with SPF.  This is what I found and I would say it&#x27;s a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily, has a nice light smell.  Easy to work with and spread throughout hair and scalp.  Haven&#x27;t had any sunburn since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Works for short hair pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Smells weird I have to say.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample from the gym I go to here on base and I was not sure what it was at first. I have wavy hair and it gets freaking crazy after I wash it so I already put lotion in my hair afterwards. The axe product is basically the same idea I actually like it a lot but gave it 3 1/2 stars because of the price. Since I got it for free definitely 5 star product. The idea is for people with dyed hair or people with frizzy hair (like me after washing) can apply a very small amount rub it through and it let&#x27;s your hair fall the way it is supposed to. If you have short hair don&#x27;t waste your time with it unless you just like the smell and how soft your hair is. Not sure why other people were saying it didn&#x27;t have a smell or smells like chemicals. I don&#x27;t use anything with sent ie deo, collogn, etc and when I put this on I definitely noticed and \\&quot;man sent\\&quot; was added and can resurface if my wife runs her hand through my hair. All in all I like the smell I just use it more for weekends or going out not everyday use, lotion is still cheaper!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
    <li> Smells good, girls just compliment me and want me so much i am turning down numbers. I get maybe 3-10 numbers daily and only take about 4. I have had 3 dates in one night before but i go on an average on 1 date daily with a new girl every time. Got my barb wire tattoo around my bicep and my ed hardy tshirt on while i cruise the avenue in my hummer. Pop the collar up on my polo shirt and spike my hair blasting my music yo girls just cant resist. Axe is the best and why should i spend $50 and smell like a mature man when i can get this stuff for $4 or less and get the fun girls. Nothing like saying \\&quot;hey your not worth a $50 cologne\\&quot; then spending $4 on a can of spray. Anyway buy this yo and say \\&quot;girl are you looking for douches, cause they are in aisle me! \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I really like the way this particular cream smells and the fact that is made especially for guys with buzz cuts. The sunscreen that’s mixed in to the cream keeps my head from sunburning when I’m out during the day.</li>
    <li> I thought since this was for hair it would have a better smell &amp; different consistency than regular sunscreen, but it doesn&#x27;t.  Very greasy &amp; white &amp; no particular scent other than chemicals.</li>
    <li> .Glad to find this here .. Cant find in stores anymore. Hope it is not discontinued,  Don&#x27;t like the greasy stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those that wear their hair very short. I have a flattop and this is the best product I have found.</li>
    <li> Not for me. I like the more natural feeling. This one is sticky, and to have it penetrate and protect the scalp (that was the main reason why I bought it for), you need to apply a larger amount, making it even stickier.</li>
    <li> Great price, fast delivery. Love that it has sunscreen right in the product; great for all my family guys that have buzz cuts and fair skin. Sun protection &amp; style all in one.</li>
    <li> I got this in a sample form with some gift baskets I ordered for my girls bday from walmart. I was confused by the product tell my 11 year old son looked it up...He has thick curly hair and after his shower he put a small amount in and it made it much softer and it smelled good!! As a mom of a Italian boy this is great BUT VERY high in price!! My husband shaves his head might try it when we go out on the lake to see if the sunblock works...let you know....hope this helps.... lower price and I would buy all the time but not worth the High Price!!    Jenn Mike&#x27;s Wife..</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. The product should work as advertised. I am beginning to think that it was all just an marketing scheme gone wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, it did its job. It was real slimy when washing it out of my hair.</li>
    <li> This works well and as intended. It&#x27;s a softer hair creme with SPF 15 sunscreen included, which is great for those of us with shortly cut and thin or balding hair. I don&#x27;t need a heavy hold and it&#x27;s nice to put on if I think I&#x27;ll be outside during of the day since I&#x27;m not much of a hat wearer. Like the other Axe hair products, this is anywhere from half to one third the price of comparable hair gels and cremes, so I&#x27;m not sure where where other reviewers are complaining about price (this is also a two pack as well). I&#x27;m not much into the overly powerful deodorants that Unilever puts out under the Axe brand, but this is the one product of theirs I really like.</li>
    <li> Product is very similar to regular sunscreen lotion. Sits heavy on your hair. There are other scalp sunscreen products out there that seem to have been developed for hair and scalp protection.</li>
    <li> I am not a &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; guy, or I wasn&#x27;t until I got a big boy job and had to look more presentable - that included using hair product. Well, I have tried a lot of different ones, expensive and cheap; creams, paste, glue.. and by far the Axe Styling Cream (yellow - Buzz Cut) is by far the best. I put a small amount on in the morning and it last all day. I have tried all the other Axe products but nothing comes close to this. Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores lately, so I&#x27;m glad I can stock up via Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since the day I saw it in the stores. I usually like to keep my haircuts short and I thought why not try this product out. It turns out to be the best styling product I have ever tried. Then my store stopped selling it so I resorted to purchasing online. I find that its much more useful in created different hair styles, I usually spike, faux hawk, or just a whatever look. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t really know where to start with hair products. (Most people already know what they want)</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but AXE stopped making this product.  I keep my hair real short, and ride a motorcycle, and this stuff is great for providing some hold while also protecting my scalp from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AXE, if you&#x27;re listening, please bring this product back!</li>
    <li> The sunscreen smell can be overwhelming at times.  Surrounding people will smell it.</li>
    <li> As advertised and a great price.  Soft cream goes a long way.  Not waterproof so the SPF factor is meaningless if you use this as hair and scalp protection at the beach.  when wet it rinses right out of hair and scalp</li>
    <li> This is an amazing deal. The local stores sell this hair cream for $9-10 a jar and I was able to buy a 2 pack for less than that. Awesome, shipping it in the mail does not affect the quality at all. Just buy it, great add on</li>
    <li> Great hair gel plus it has sunscreen spf 15 protection for my balding melon!</li>
    <li> Holds hair without the sticky mess. Dries dry and flexible, not stiff. SPF too.</li>
    <li> keeping it soft and unkinked in hot weather.  I got scared for a minute not being able to find this kind of AXE.  Love, love, love it.  Will buy a couple of jars at a time from here on out.  Once you go AXE you can&#x27;t go back!  My hair is cut in a girly long on top and shorter on one side more than the other - kind of like Emelie Sunde of England, but I&#x27;ve had this style for nearly 10 years.Love that I can wash hair, put in the cream, brush down until smooth, then use rake it up and it stays that way, while allowing my short sides stay smoothly laid down.  Guess you might say it&#x27;s not just for men any more!</li>
    <li> axe always comes up with great products, never disappointed with them. the cream is not to heavy not to light and lasts all day</li>
