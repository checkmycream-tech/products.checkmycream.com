      <li>These really are the best eyeliners out there.</li>

      <li>and the fact is it keeps me from being able to see well.</li>

      <li>The color selection is fantastic too!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite eye liner EVER.</li>
      <li>overall though I think this is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>The color I bought is a lovely plum (empire) in the 24/7 glide-on eye pencil.</li>
      <li>For most people I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, but I was very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product, very pigmented &amp; glides on smooth.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly but whatever toxic chemicals they are using in it to make it glide on so smoothly made my eyelids swell up drastically</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I still like it because it really looks good on the eyes</li>
      <li>24/7 is so easy to apply, it glides across both the lid and waterline.  </li>
      <li>This product goes on extremely easily but doesn&#x27;t smudge once it is on.  </li>
      <li>black perversion is the best.</li>
      <li>It glides on so smoothly and covers easily.  </li>
      <li>My cheap eyeliner kept drifting around</li>
      <li>They glide on smoothly and stay on all day.</li>
      <li>it was as described, and the buyer was friendly too .</li>
      <li>and when i take them out to clean it i can see the eyeliner on it.  </li>
      <li>Love the eyeliner so much.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super pigmented and creamy.</li>
      <li>They glide on incredibly smooth and leave a dramatic and perfect line.  </li>
      <li>This applies easily and has a soft texture.</li>
      <li>love urban decay products!  </li>
      <li>Favorite eyeliner, so easy to glide on stays nice and dark black.</li>
      <li>so I put new contacts in &amp; sure enuf the next day</li>
      <li>It went on pretty clumpy for me and trying to clean it up with my fingers just left me with eyeliner smear all over my hands and face.</li>
      <li>it can be kinda hard to remove unless you have a good eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>thanks a lot</li>
      <li>The color effect is very vivid--close to that of a cream based liner.</li>
      <li>This is the absolute blackest and smoothest eye pencil I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>the line does not come straight on the eyes.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Perversion is my favorite shade; it&#x27;s a super jet-black that is creamy and rich and leaves a really dramatic line.  </li>
      <li>Soft, super black and not come out easily.</li>
      <li>and i havent&#x27; found a pencil that can be so bold as the urban decays.</li>
      <li>Now i try to put them in after i have applied the eyeliner, and has been a little bit better.  </li>
      <li>but if you DO cry and don&#x27;t touch, it looks pretty much the same as when you applied it.</li>
      <li>I thought it was just normal allergies, so I took Claritin</li>
      <li>So I finally Googled this &amp; saw many people who wear contacts &amp; use this specific color have had the same problem.</li>
      <li>&amp; I recommend this color for any other contact wearers who have had this same issue but still want a good black eyeliner.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive eyes, stay away.</li>
      <li>I complete my workout without getting panda eyes, and that&#x27;s after a 8 hour work day.  </li>
      <li>I have allergies and am sensitive to makeup- had this stuff on all day and no reaction at all, not even putting it on.</li>
      <li>Super deep black eyeliner glides on with ease.</li>
      <li>really upset that I spent $19 on an eyeliner</li>
      <li>I recommend it for anyone looking for a deep black that is long lasting but silky smooth to apply.</li>
      <li>Super black and very long lasting.</li>
      <li>The dark color really made eyes pop.</li>

<li> Super black and very long lasting.</li>
<li> The dark color really made eyes pop.</li>
<li> It is much blacker and creamier than Zero, which I also love and use on days when I want something less dark and dramatic.  </li>
<li> These pencils are well-worth the cost, and will last a long time.  </li>
<li> The other problem is they dull quickly.  </li>
<li> I use it on my water line, and it lasts a really long time without running underneath my eyes.</li>
<li> it does dry within 30 seconds</li>
<li> glides on and stays on - dark and mysterious!  </li>
<li> Not really a fan of having to sharpen a pencil liner</li>
<li> , the pros of it is how dark it comes out and how it stays on for a long time and still looks fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I found you have to keep sharpening and have a sharp tip or else</li>
<li> Well I didn&#x27;t know the blurry spots were due to the eyeliner</li>
<li> its 10 dollars cheaper in sephora and other beauty stores.</li>
<li> I refuse to use any other brand.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sad because I really want to like this product.</li>
<li> The eyeliner goes on beautifully, no tugging, but my eyelids are now red and swollen, although I remove the eyeliner at night, my eyes stream tears steadily when I&#x27;m outside working out, my contacts are unwearable, and I had to wear sunglasses in the office all day when meeting clients because of the scary redness.</li>
<li> I wear contacts &amp; I&#x27;ve been using this brand of eyeliner for years in the color zero which is just another form of black &amp; never had a problem.</li>
<li> I can go about 6 hours before I see a little smudge from the waterline.  </li>
<li> I use mine everyday</li>
<li> It is also a very dark black!</li>
<li> The color lasts all-day and requires no more applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> What a waste of money!</li>
<li> On days that I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face before a workout or Zumba, it survives.  </li>
<li> what I&#x27;ve ever paid for eyeliner in the past, but I did it because I needed an eyeliner that would stay put.</li>
<li> He arrived at my house a few days!</li>
<li> A tip for applying do not push hard when applying you don&#x27;t need to and if you do it will smudge and cause clumps on your eyelid</li>
<li> That&#x27;s at least three times</li>
<li> I seriously would recommend it to every one I know.</li>
<li> If you are going to use eyeliner I seriously recommend this brand.</li>
<li> not sure why its being sold so expensive on amazon.</li>
<li> I found that irritating after a while and decided to give the 24/7 a try.  </li>

    <li> I bought this for my wife and she like it. it was as described, and the buyer was friendly too . thanks a lot</li>
    <li> Great product, very pigmented &amp; glides on smooth. I wear contacts &amp; I&#x27;ve been using this brand of eyeliner for years in the color zero which is just another form of black &amp; never had a problem. I got perversion for Christmas &amp; just started using it &amp; noticed the 30 minutes or so after applying it that both my contacts had blurry spots. I tried cleaning them with contact solution &amp; soaking them over night &amp; the smudges were permanent so I had to throw the contacts out &amp; I noticed my eyes have been watering &amp; red. Well I didn&#x27;t know the blurry spots were due to the eyeliner so I put new contacts in &amp; sure enuf the next day I got more spots on both eyes after applying the eyeliner. So I finally Googled this &amp; saw many people who wear contacts &amp; use this specific color have had the same problem. So this product cost me 2 pairs of contacts. I am going to go back to using the color zero &amp; I recommend this color for any other contact wearers who have had this same issue but still want a good black eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Love the eyeliner so much. It&#x27;s so easy on it truly is amazing. I have allergies and am sensitive to makeup- had this stuff on all day and no reaction at all, not even putting it on. Am planning on buying some more!</li>
    <li> These are hands-down my favorite eye pencils ever!  They glide on incredibly smooth and leave a dramatic and perfect line.  You can use your finger or a blending sponge to blend them into your lash line, and then they stick.  The color lasts all-day and requires no more applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perversion is my favorite shade; it&#x27;s a super jet-black that is creamy and rich and leaves a really dramatic line.  It is much blacker and creamier than Zero, which I also love and use on days when I want something less dark and dramatic.  These pencils are well-worth the cost, and will last a long time.  I use mine everyday and I have had it for well over a year already.  Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Allergic.  Tried two different occasions months apart.  Sanatized.  Allergic. What&#x27;s in it?</li>
    <li> I have heard nothing but rave reviews about this product, so for the sake of being fair and balanced I thought I should share my experience. For most people I&#x27;m sure this is a great product, but I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy mine at Amazon, I bought it at a beauty store and paid $19. That&#x27;s at least three times what I&#x27;ve ever paid for eyeliner in the past, but I did it because I needed an eyeliner that would stay put. My cheap eyeliner kept drifting around and I would have really ugly smudges under my eyes within minutes. Everyone said Urban Decay would last all day, so I paid the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, it does stay on well. That is, unless you have a constant stream of tears running over it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had an allergic reaction to a makeup before, but this eyeliner caused my eyes to water non-stop. I thought it was just normal allergies, so I took Claritin and I bought some antihistamine eye drops, but nothing worked until I stopped wearing the eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really upset that I spent $19 on an eyeliner I can&#x27;t wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t feel like it went on as nicely as everyone else says it does. It went on pretty clumpy for me and trying to clean it up with my fingers just left me with eyeliner smear all over my hands and face. Putting this stuff on was a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did look really good once I had it on though. The dark color really made eyes pop. I liked the way it looked, I just didn&#x27;t like the allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just felt like I should put that out there, so people know this is a possibility. If you have sensitive eyes, stay away.</li>
    <li> Received a sample of this from a makeup club and haven&#x27;t used anything else since! It goes on&lt;br /&gt;with ease,  doesn&#x27;t smudge or smear.. for me it stays on all day even on my waterline. It is also a very dark black!</li>
    <li> they claim that this doesnt crease like the rest of eye liner pencils but it does even if you accidentaly rub your eyes it will come off</li>
    <li> The best eye liner there is. Super black and very long lasting. I just love the 24/7 items form UD</li>
    <li> It goes on very smoothly but whatever toxic chemicals they are using in it to make it glide on so smoothly made my eyelids swell up drastically and I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to make up!</li>
    <li> best eye lining pencil around.  glides on and stays on - dark and mysterious!  love urban decay products!  black perversion is the best.</li>
    <li> Not really a fan of having to sharpen a pencil liner so I wasnt so trill to purchase it, however, I did and I&#x27;m happy with the results so no problem sharpening it.</li>
    <li> I 100% recommend this eyeliner.  It goes on with ease - no pulling on your skin and it stays on well.  I refuse to use any other brand.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I seriously would recommend it to every one I know. Super deep black eyeliner glides on with ease. If you are going to use eyeliner I seriously recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Soft, super black and not come out easily. He arrived at my house a few days! Surely will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute blackest and smoothest eye pencil I have ever used.  I recommend it for anyone looking for a deep black that is long lasting but silky smooth to apply.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite eye liner EVER. For years I had been using eyeliner that would just smudge and smear after a couple hours of wearing it, but not this one! I use it on my water line, and it lasts a really long time without running underneath my eyes. This eyeliner I don&#x27;t have to reapply throughout the day which is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so sad because I really want to like this product. The color is gorgeous but when I put it on i get an allergic reaction. It&#x27;s like nonstop eye buggers that accumulate and the fact is it keeps me from being able to see well. It&#x27;s so horrible. I&#x27;ve never had this happen with any eyeliner before. I can&#x27;t believe I paid about 19 dollars for it at Sephora.</li>
    <li> Favorite eyeliner, so easy to glide on stays nice and dark black.</li>
    <li> I tried the For Ever Makeup Aqua.  It lasted, however, it was a pain to put on.  It would tug at my top lid.  I found that irritating after a while and decided to give the 24/7 a try.  24/7 is so easy to apply, it glides across both the lid and waterline.  I love it!  I can go about 6 hours before I see a little smudge from the waterline.  Hey, no makeup is perfect.  On days that I&#x27;m too lazy to wash my face before a workout or Zumba, it survives.  I complete my workout without getting panda eyes, and that&#x27;s after a 8 hour work day.  I love it.  Won&#x27;t be a switching..</li>
    <li> I like this eyeliner, the pros of it is how dark it comes out and how it stays on for a long time and still looks fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i found is that for some reason when i wear my contacts i find the eyeliner some how gets on them and blurs them and when i take them out to clean it i can see the eyeliner on it.  Now i try to put them in after i have applied the eyeliner, and has been a little bit better.  The other problem is they dull quickly.  I found you have to keep sharpening and have a sharp tip or else the line does not come straight on the eyes.  It almost acts like a liquid liner once its on and its smudged you have to take it all off to apply again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I still like it because it really looks good on the eyes and i havent&#x27; found a pencil that can be so bold as the urban decays. A tip for applying do not push hard when applying you don&#x27;t need to and if you do it will smudge and cause clumps on your eyelid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also its 10 dollars cheaper in sephora and other beauty stores. not sure why its being sold so expensive on amazon.</li>
    <li> I have never been allergic to anything in my life but this eyeliner caused my eye lids to swell up. What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> this stuff stays put. unless you cry and then wipe your eyes. but if you DO cry and don&#x27;t touch, it looks pretty much the same as when you applied it. it&#x27;s super pigmented and creamy. it does dry within 30 seconds so if you&#x27;re gonna use an eyeliner brush, try to do so before that 30 seconds is up. it can be kinda hard to remove unless you have a good eye makeup remover. overall though I think this is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. all others eventually fade as the day goes on, but this stuff is meant for all day. give it a try.</li>
    <li> Easily the best eyeliner I have ever used.  This product goes on extremely easily but doesn&#x27;t smudge once it is on.  It glides on so smoothly and covers easily.  I love the darkness of the color.  It is like using a kohl liner in terms of darkness and ease of use.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner goes on beautifully, no tugging, but my eyelids are now red and swollen, although I remove the eyeliner at night, my eyes stream tears steadily when I&#x27;m outside working out, my contacts are unwearable, and I had to wear sunglasses in the office all day when meeting clients because of the scary redness. I&#x27;m so disappointed! The color I bought is a lovely plum (empire) in the 24/7 glide-on eye pencil.</li>
    <li> These really are the best eyeliners out there. They glide on smoothly and stay on all day. The color selection is fantastic too!</li>
    <li> This applies easily and has a soft texture. The color effect is very vivid--close to that of a cream based liner. Only downside is that this eyeliner will not stay put on waterline or lower lid. It smudges after all day of wear. It also requires oil based makeup remover.</li>
