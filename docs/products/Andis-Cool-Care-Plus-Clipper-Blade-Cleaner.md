<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product....fast shipping!!!</li>
    <li> I use the Andis T-Edger II and it get heated sometimes.  I just use the Cool Care and some Clipper oil and I&#x27;m back in business.  Additionally, it disinfect the blades and keep them cool.  I cut my own hair and this helps me big time!  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Arrived with cap broken. Big problem for me !</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do without it when shaving. Speeds up the process.</li>
    <li> I had never used this product before with my old clipper set, but saw it as a recommended add-on purchase when i got my new Andis clippers. This stuff works great at keeping the blades cool, lubricated, and clean. The smell is a little potent but not unpleasant. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the clean smell and works great</li>
    <li> a must have for your clippers and trimmer</li>
    <li> We are using this to cool down our dog clippers when they get heated from use. Doesn&#x27;t make them cold immediately, but speeds up the cooling nicely. That in turn helps to move things along and keeps the pup happy. Plus it has a really pleasing fragrance. Turns dreary doggy shaving day into a wonderful doggy day at the spa.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully. Our pups are happy; we&#x27;re happy!</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> We used it on our Andis ceramic blade clipper. It cooled the blade as it should. Definitely worth buying if you think about clipping your dog by your own.</li>
    <li> When i got this iteam i loved the smell of it but then i couldn&#x27;t hep to noticed that every time i sprayed it down on my Andis Masters It would make my clipper get all crazy and made y costumers think i was unprofessional but after i tighten up my blades fully and sprayed it down it made my blades perfect and has been like that ever since.. now i can say i cant cut without it.</li>
    <li> We have not used this item yet....but every item I have purchased with Andis on it is great!  We will never purchase any other brand products.</li>
    <li> It is needed to cool off the clippers and avoid burns to the pet. Otherwise, it is great to have hand.</li>
    <li> I use this product with my Andis AGC UntralEdge and it really helps cool down the machine after getting really hot. Helps getting the job done faster!</li>
    <li> This product came in very handy when clipping a large horse to cool my clipper blades and keep them clean.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it to you guys also.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the item.&lt;br /&gt;It helps me shave with no problems at all</li>
    <li> put a lighter in front of this sucker and you&#x27;ve got yourself a friggin blowtorch! absolutely wonderfully and fantastically spectacular!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it does. Not only does it cool the blades down but it cleans and disinfects also. A wonderful and necessary product. I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I purchased on Amazon new Andis Professional Clippers. They do get warm while cutting my poodles fur....probably because I&#x27;m not an experienced professional groomer so it takes me longer to groom her. This spray cools down the blades as advertised. I also wanted something to keep the clippers clean.</li>
    <li> This is just as advertised. It is necessary to keep the blades oiled and it makes clipping much easier. If the clippers slow, just a drop of oil gets them moving again. A must if you are going to clip your own pet&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done as needed.</li>
    <li> WOKS GOOD. GOOD SHIPPER.</li>
    <li> Got to have it! Best clipper lubricant. Andis!!!</li>
    <li> Im happy I bought this with my clippers nd scissors . It has a great smell.</li>
    <li> For the price you won&#x27;t find a better value for clipper blade lubricant.  Simple and easy to use! Just spray on and run the clippers for a couple seconds. This product cleans, disinfects, and lubricates all in one step. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product... keep your clippers SHARP &amp; RUST FREE with this product!!!</li>
    <li> This was awesome! Used on an older model and made it run like new. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Cleans clippers, scissors and nail clippers well and disinfects. Cools blades down immediately.</li>
    <li> Spraying this on clipper blades helps them stay cool while grooming my cocker.  It works as expected.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep the clippers cool.  Doesn&#x27;t cool them down once they are hot.</li>
    <li> Love this spray, will never be without it.</li>
    <li> Use this on all my clippers.</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; fast delivery  !! Perfect for lubing up clippers</li>
    <li> The best clipper cleaner!  Been using this for many years!</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT IS GOOD BUT NO RESTRICTIONS FOR SHIPMENT TO SANTO DOMINGO, REP. DOM. I was unaware of, DANGEROUS GOODS FOR BEING ME AND NEVER CAME.</li>
    <li> like i said only blade cleaner i use. osters is okay but it doesnt oil your blades like andis does. and for some reason i just can&#x27;t stand the smell of the osters blade cleaner. great product</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! delivered on time as well.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and it&#x27;s what my barber uses at the shop. I use it on my Wahl fade clipper before I shave. Just have to dry the blades with a paper towel before I put it to my face.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  It sanitizes and lubricates your blades at the same time.  If you own a clipper you should consider buying this.</li>
    <li> Great for cooling down clippers.</li>
    <li> This aerosol blade coolant and lubricant combined with a set of ceramic blades, makes it possible for me to clip my whole horse in one session. I always have an extra can because I don&#x27;t want to run out in mid-clipping.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Just a couple quick sprays needed to keep blades cool and lubricated. A must have for the Andis Ultra Clip 10 Piece Clipper Kit</li>
    <li> Works as it should...</li>
    <li> Last me almost a year at a time. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works great. I wonder how they really make this stuff. As soon as it is sprayed onto a hot blade, the blade is cool, and allows for the job to continue. Fabulous product. I wouldn&#x27;t groom without it.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for anyone using clippers &amp; Trimmers.  I use my Clippers and Trimmers every week.  It cleans lubricates and sanitize.  What more can you ask for?  Gently spray on like you are spraying paint.  Don&#x27;t go nuts.  The scent was nice like a cologne, it is not unbearable like some reviews stated.</li>
    <li> I ben a barber for over 30 years this cool care plus work so good make life easy less cleaning blades are so much cooler you&lt;br /&gt;cant beat that cooler blades mean less burns and more happy satisfied customers and that&#x27;s what a barber wants so pick up sum&lt;br /&gt;Andis Cool Care !!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much on cooling clippers, but hopefully it will work otherwise on germs and keeping blades sharp.  Have only used for one clipping thus far.</li>
    <li> Works great...a hot blade makes for an unhappy dog.</li>
    <li> strong smell but I like this spray</li>
    <li> Keep your clippers clean and running. Can lasts a long time. Good price</li>
    <li> Works just as advertised. 😁</li>
    <li> Great stuff would recommend! I will be buying this again !</li>
    <li> The Andis Cool Care Plus really makes clipping super quick and easy! I read the reviews on the smell, but it&#x27;s not that bad. Reminds me of some cheap cologne my brother wore as a kid that smelled ok. I think the problem would be if you groomed your pet in the bathroom(like I do), that you forget that I am spraying a chemical so the door/window needs to be open. If not then yea I guess it could smell bad. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this for myself and now grooming is way easier &amp; comfortable for my pets at a lower cost to boot.</li>
    <li> love the smell and cleans my clippers</li>
    <li> I can really feel it cooling down the clipper blades. If I do a fade I go around and make the first line, then I use this to cool blade, switch to liners, go back to this, remove lines from fade, hit with the spray, switch to liners, and boom. Clippers never get &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; but do get warm like normal. I wish I always had this product. Everyone cutting hair from those at home with no real talent (need more time) to those in the shops busting out the cuts.</li>
    <li> This productr works great for quick use while clipping hair and after. Don&#x27;t mind the scent at all. Keeps my gear in top condition and ready for the next cut. Dont&#x27; know why but the product picture is wrong??????</li>
    <li> Great product. Keeps the blades cool.</li>
    <li> Extend the life of your hair clippers with this product. Will last quite a while with this size can.</li>
    <li> I save a lot  of money by clipping my dog myself. And he is  a lot happier having me do it.</li>
    <li> A must have if you have the clippers.</li>
    <li> This spray works as advertised.  I would recommend this product as companion to any clipper. Keeps it cool and lubricated</li>
    <li> I used to use Oster spray, which is a bit more expensive than Cool Care. I find this works at least as well. I spray it on my Braun razor before shaving and it makes the razor run more smoothly and also cooles the blades down a bit. I also like the scent.</li>
    <li> cools down and lubricates</li>
    <li> The foster mom of my dog recommended this and it seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades is great!!  We have used it with our Andis Clipper while cutting our Labbra-doobles for the summer -   it helps keeps things running well and clean!!Much less messy then drippy non-spray oil bottles.</li>
    <li> amazing!!! love this stuff</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased this cooling spray, the clippers get so hot so fast and this helps the blades cool down faster.</li>
    <li> im not using this my husband is but im sure hes gonna like it when he shaves for the cool feeling</li>
    <li> The smell is acceptable for me and it can cool down the blade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;As the blade become heat quickly, it is a must to have the cool down spray.</li>
    <li> Bought this when I bought the clippers, however, the clippers do not get too hot and I can do both dogs without needing the spray.  I would not buy it and had I trimmed the dogs sooner and found that they don&#x27;t get too hot, I would have returned this.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. i wish they were a little cheaper but all in all good product. Will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want to ever clip your pet without this.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothe easy clipping, Nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Works great, literally feels cool upon use (say for longer clipping jobs) and lasts forever for cheap.</li>
    <li> Before I started cutting my own hair, I noticed my barbers would use this product. I decided I&#x27;d try it out for my own clippers. Works really well to clean hair out of the blades. Also has a fresh scent. Be careful when spraying in small, or enclosed spaces (I.E. Bathroom, or in/over the sink). You don&#x27;t want to get this stuff in your eyes. Also highly flammable</li>
    <li> This spray works good on my cat clippers. Only lube I need and also cools blades while working</li>
    <li> Great product! We use this on hair trimmers, personal trimmers and electric shavers! Highly recommend! We have definitely noticed a difference in how smoothly they are running since we started using this to disinfect and lube them up.</li>
    <li> Use this on clippers and edgers/nippers to quickly clean, disinfect and lubricate them.  Works wonderfully and keeps the mechanism running smoothly.</li>
    <li> Very good this stuff does what is says it does</li>
    <li> Good cleaner for clipper. I use it often anytime I shave even for my kids. It cool off hot clipper blade and one feel cool as you shave or barb</li>
    <li> As advertised. packing could have been a little better though. It made it intact but I believe it was more to due with luck.</li>
    <li> Seemed to lube well but didn&#x27;t cool clippers down as much as I would like.</li>
    <li> It definitely keeps the clippers cooler.  Not sure what it&#x27;s made of so my only concern is some of it coming in contact with the dog&#x27;s skin.  We always bath them after they are trimmed anyway, so I guess it is a small concern.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend who is running a barbering shop and he loves this stuff very much. I think this is a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my barber uses this same spray.  Between customers, they&#x27;ll give the clipper blades a squirt of this stuff and shake off any excess.  I figured if it was good enough for the pros that use their clippers for many continuous hours every day, its good enough for me.  So I bought this for my home clippers - mine don&#x27;t get anywhere near the use of my barber.  I use my clippers for beard trimming and occassional haircuts.  Now I&#x27;ll give my clippers a quick squirt before and after each use.  The product indicates it lubricates (true), cools (my clippers never really overheat) and prevents rust (I keep my clippers in the basement where it can get somewhat humit, and they&#x27;re staying shiny and new looking).  I think this spray does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray is large and should last me quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
    <li> this product does exactly what it advertises. I will keep it on hand and recommend it to other groomers TY</li>
    <li> Good stuff. It is what I use on my pet clippers and it cleans and lubes very well.</li>
    <li> I got this with my new clipper.  Works well and keeps the temp down.  I am not a pro or anything, so this can will last quite a while as a few shots is all you need.</li>
    <li> This is a great product help keep my blade clean a feels like i get a better shave with a lot less nicks</li>
    <li> This spray works great, when the kid starts squirming from the blade being too hot, just give it a squirt-</li>
    <li> Well I Have Always Been A Wahl Man And I Just Received The Andis GTX and i Must Say I Was Very Pleased. Im Only Using It To Do Shape Ups, I Always Wanted That Crisp Clean Line Up So Fresh Out The Box It Was Sharp. I Ended Up Zero Gapping The Blade Just A Couple Hours After I Did My First Shape Up And I Must Say It Was A Big Difference.</li>
    <li> A must for anyone clipping their dog.  A shoot on the blades every couple of minutes keeps them cool and sharp.  You use so little each time that a can should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well for the  Wahl Professional 8081 5-star Series Detailer.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps it clean, disinfected and lubricated.&lt;br /&gt;This size can will last quite a while.</li>
    <li> Keeps my T-outliner in good condition. Smells pretty fresh and clean. I like to spray it half-way through doing my head as well as afterwards before putting it away.</li>
    <li> My clippers are clean and have not had to disassemble to remove hair that builds up on top of blades. Also helps them run cooler and extends the life of the blades.</li>
    <li> Good stuff here way better than the spray I got at walmart last time price quantity and quality.  Can go wrong here this stuff is great for your clippers.</li>
    <li> Andis Cool Care + For Clipper Blades  is ideal for keeping your clippers cool and comfortable.  I fully recommend it on all your hair cutting jobs.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with the Andis 21420 clippers. It seems to work as advertised and cools and lubricates the clippers when using them. Will buy again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> It was just what I ordered to make grooming easier. Everything was great. I haven used any other products but, this was what was suggested to me.  much appreciated.</li>
    <li> I still prefer just to oil the blade. Spraying just sends the oil every where. A little messy, I think</li>
    <li> Unsanitary tools are unacceptable, and people like to see first hand the tools that you&#x27;re using on their head are sanitary.  This offers a quick, easy way to sanitize your tools in front of your client.  It takes very little of this product to get the job done, so the can goes a very long way.  The fact that it lubricates your clippers as well is also a very nice feature.  I couldn&#x27;t see using clippers without it!</li>
    <li> This product works great with my clippers. Smells like the barbershop material when I use it. I really works as well. Great price and product. Also with its size, it will last forever</li>
    <li> Big bottle, smells bad. But gets the job done and does as advertised. The nozzle is a bit too powerful.</li>
    <li> does what its suppose to do!</li>
    <li> keep my stuff new and clean got to love this stuff</li>
    <li> I like the fact that I can cool, disinfect, and lubricate the blade with one product. It does all three pretty well.</li>
    <li> Cooled my clippers as I shaved two dogs with thick hair, one after the other.  A bichon mix and a collie mix.</li>
    <li> Works great when using on clippers to cool them down....</li>
    <li> a must have for Andis clipper, it does cool the blades off fairly quickly as it tends to get hot after a period time of running.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product was shipped to me on time, and the product was everything I wanted it to be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great product for lucubrating and disinfecting clippers.</li>
    <li> It works fine I guess.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t magically turn the hot blade cool in a second, but it sure does help cooling faster.  Not too oily either.  But it smells like old grandpa&#x27;s barbershop.  Yuck!  Yuck and yuck and yuck!  Ewwwwwww</li>
    <li> I thought this spray would magically cool down the blades on the clippers and maybe it does some but, I still had to take a break from clipping my dog because the clippers were too hot.  I like that it can also be used like an antiseptic type cleaner, for clipping multiple animals.  Admittedly, I only have one dog with a heavy coat and I am new to clipping.</li>
    <li> This  cleans clippers very well and gives it a nice smell. The prices is reasonable and it is a very large bottle. Must have to maintain clippers.</li>
    <li> If you cut your own hair, you really have to maintain your clippers and blades. Money does not grow on trees. With that said; this product is a must have. You get a lubricant, conditioner, and preservative all in one application. This way, you save money, and you elminate cluttering up your shelf or cabinet. Plus it smells good. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great for clippers, keeps them sharp &amp; oiled.. Nice smell doesn&#x27;t stink at all.. Perfect for clippers that get hot very fast. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> It is just like the first one we go when we purchased our clippers.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great product, does keep blades cool, and them lubricanted.</li>
    <li> works as stated..cools the blades nicely</li>
    <li> Good smelling spray, not as slippery as the 3-in one oil I used to use but I like that it disinfects as I use it. I spray a little before I start trimming\edging my beard then I spray some to store my trimmer.</li>
    <li> i used these on my other andis clippers and all i did was spray the andis cool care plus on my clippers blade and next thing i know after shaking my clippers a bunch of black  chunk of hair balls came out the more i hit the side of my clippers the more came out and it my clippers that i had for more than a year worked better i mean like closer shaking these are really good in keep your clippers in great shape for future uses.</li>
    <li> This spray is very easy to use and keeps you cutting blades working. I wish all products were the same way just aim and spray. It also does everything that you need cools lubes and disinfects.</li>
    <li> This is a TALL can!!! Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, cools and lubricates clippers.</li>
    <li> A must have if you ordered clippers, arrived as scheduled!</li>
    <li> Great product for cleaning and cooling my grooming blades. Even with thick coated dogs. Shipping was prompt and delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep my blades cool when I&#x27;m clipping my schnauzer.  Also I use to clean the blades when I finished.  Great stuff!!</li>
    <li> Good product...cooled the blades awesomely.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this stuff!!! I spray it on 5 minutes before I shave, let it dry, and to work I go!!</li>
    <li> This is the best!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Any one that is clipping needs this.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have.</li>
    <li> Great product that cool&#x27;s your clippers during use, also provides a strong disinfectant and lubricant to protect the life of your blades.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great to use while doing body clipping of horses and dogs.  essential to keeping the blades doing their job.</li>
    <li> A lot bigger than I expected. The can was a bit bigger than a normal shampoo bottle.</li>
    <li> Cools the blade well, Love that it disinfects as well.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Tis was very affordable, one bottle would last me months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had any problems with my clippers while using these.</li>
    <li> Received my package in the estimated time frame. This product works great and there is no substitute.</li>
    <li> 600+ reviews... I don&#x27;t know what I can add.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now (a total of approx 30 dog clippings), and while I don&#x27;t think this is a stellar product, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product either.  I&#x27;m neutral, hence the 3-star rating.  This is a 5-in-1 product, so let&#x27;s just go through the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coolant: I have to admit that it does a pretty good job of this.  There are certainly better coolants out there (just go to any machine shop), but the Cool Care Plus does a decent job for the application at hand.  I&#x27;m not keen on the aerosol delivery--I think a lot of product gets wasted and it goes everywhere--but it&#x27;s a convenient method when you&#x27;re in the middle of a clipping and dealing with anxious pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disinfectant: How would you even determine if it does anything in this category?  Some things you just have to take on faith, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lubricant: I don&#x27;t think this works nearly as well as, say, plain ol&#x27; WD-40; but on the other hand, it smells a lot nicer and doesn&#x27;t leave the dogs with greasy fur.  The clippers definitely run smoother after applying this stuff, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner: Seriously?  Let&#x27;s just say that it doesn&#x27;t repel dog fur and leave it at that, let alone clean anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rust Preventer: I kind of have to laugh at this one... almost as much as the \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; aspect.  Most clipper blades are stainless steel--and now they&#x27;re coming out with titanium blades, ceramic baldes, and other exotic materials too--so they already have anti-corrosive properties to them to begin with, regardless of whether this product is used or not!  So, much like the \\&quot;disinfectant\\&quot; part of the 5-in-1 claims, I have to take it on faith that this product actually does anything for rust prevention.  Regardless, this certainly would _not_ be my first choice for a rust preventive.  There are scads of tool wipes, firearm protectants, auto detailing products, and many other anti-rust products out there that arefar superior as corrosion inhibitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, this product is a pretty good coolant, and average (or unverifiable) in the other categories.  What you&#x27;re paying for here, I think, is convenience... an alleged 5-in-1 product with an easy-to-use (albeit wasteful &amp; messy) aerosol application.  When you get right down to the heart of the matter, though, the clippers _do_ run smoother, cooler, and with higher RPMs after being sprayed with this stuff, so yes the product is beneficial to use, and the dogs don&#x27;t hate the smell.</li>
    <li> It REALLY works! As soon as the clipper gets hot, I spray this on and it cools it in seconds.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product it is my favorite to use. It works great and fast. It really foes its job. Thank you</li>
    <li> Just as described. It cools my clippers so I can continue trimming all my dogs without waiting for the clippers to cool. Amazing! I use it on both my Andis &amp; Oster clippers.</li>
    <li> Very Good the cool care plus very good for clippers fot the maintainence. This also saves a lot of money for me because it prevents my shver from going bad.</li>
    <li> Used this stuff when I was working in a barber shop a few years ago, but since doing hair on the side the past few years, my clippers have gotten pretty jammed up. I thought the generic oil I was using was enough. But once I sprayed this stuff on my clippers, they ran through my clients hair like a hot knife in room temperature butter! I will never go without this stuff again!</li>
    <li> This product is great, will buy more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Regular use of this product, keeps my expensive pet groomer, in good working order.  It lubricates, aids in cleaning and keeps the blades cool, while in use.  I would definately recommend!</li>
    <li> keeps it cool, not greasy</li>
    <li> Great stuff, cleans, lubricates and stops the noise.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping also. I use andis cool care a million times when i cut dogs out in the heat in houston. It works amazing and fairly fast also.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my dog clipper blades get so hot.  It helped a little, but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.  I have a ceramic blade - still gets hot.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I expected. It cleans, and cools both my clippers and trimmers. Definitely worth the price listed.</li>
    <li> smell like the barber shop</li>
    <li> It does what it says, the cool down time of a clipper really decreases with this stuff</li>
    <li> thought this stuff was supposed to keep my blade cool and it still is on fire! i would not recomment</li>
    <li> This spray works as described. It cools down the blades almost instantly and helps me finish grooming my labradoodle in way less time!</li>
    <li> Got the product fast and in a professional manner. I was very pleased with the service. I will shop here again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to make my clippers and beard/mustache trimmer last longer and be sanitary. It seems to lubricate them well and I assume sanitize them, although it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve sent my clippers out to the lab to see if they are sanitary or not. The smell is not unpleasant although at the same time isn&#x27;t entirely pleasant either. This is a large can and I imagine that it will last a very long time (I&#x27;m guessing years with weekly use).</li>
    <li> I bought a new clipper for use on my dogs.  I needed something to clean, disinfect, lubricant, etc.... this product is fantastic! I spray the clipper while in use.  Really cools the blade. No need to buy 3 or more products when this 1 will do!  Saves time and money.</li>
    <li> Works very well with our clippers.</li>
    <li> very good at cleaning and cooling my dog shears</li>
    <li> this is a quality product that works good to disinfect and clean. it also has a nice smell compared to other cleaners.</li>
    <li> Does as expected; believe it will lengthen the life of the blade.</li>
    <li> I purchased this when I purchased my clippers.  The clippers do get HOT and this resolves the problem quickly.. A must have so as not to burn your pets skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> cools off our clippers and its good stuff!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t have clippers or liners without these. Quick and easy to apply. Cleans and lubricates my equipment. Cool Care plus sells itself and I recommend it to anyone with clippers and/or liners.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Good Price.  Excellent service.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for cooling down clippers while grooming the dog. Easy to use and good cost for the large size can.</li>
    <li> The Andis Cool Care Plus product smells really good and seems to work just like the description said it would.</li>
    <li> When I used really cool down the clipper blade&lt;br /&gt;I really pay for the price of the item&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend</li>
    <li> This product does indeed cool the clippers during trimming.  The sanitizer is more for my peace of mind.  At such a low price I recommend it.  Plus it is easier than the oil drops.</li>
    <li> just what i needed, came quickly.</li>
    <li> great product. I used it for my grooming machine for my dog. My grooming machine used to get really hot with put the spray and it was almost impossible to groom my dog at home. Since I got the spray it is an easy job to groom my dog at home.</li>
    <li> Works well with my clippers. I don&#x27;t  have to worry about my clippers messing up or not being clean anymore.</li>
    <li> It makes  my clippers cut easier &amp; smooth</li>
    <li> I ordered the Andis AGC Super 2-Speed Professional Animal Clipper, the comb attachments and this spray. I did need to use this spray on the metal blades so I am glad that I ordered it at the same time. The product is reasonably priced and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> great product, Perfect!!!!</li>
    <li> It is very good and effective. It works well, it disinfect and lubricate at the same time. Good to spray on all hair product</li>
    <li> This product seems to be delivering and working as expected.  I used it just twice and it seems like it will help the blade last longer</li>
    <li> Only used it once. Seems to work good.</li>
    <li> Coolant for my Angis dog clippers I am so happy I ordered this.  It cools off the blades so fast and on top of that my dogs are happy a win win for me and my dogs.  Thanks:).</li>
    <li> Great for our dog and people clippers to clean and cool during use! Worked as expected to both lube and clean.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I cut my hair.  Has kept both my trimmer and clippers in great condition for years.</li>
    <li> not oily and has pleasant smell</li>
    <li> 5 in 1 is the best for clippers and the price was a great find as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Im embarrassed to say I had no idea you needed to disinfect hair clippers and My andis speedmaster II&#x27;s were giving me aids when I shaved no guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I asked around what could be causing the problem this issue came up.  Im pleased to say on my new Wahl 5 Star Seniors that problem is a problem no more thanks to the Andis cool care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it disinfect but it lubricates as well as cools the blade. So far im extremely pleased and the head aids has cleared up since I started using this product. Also my clippers dont burn me no more when doing longer cuts. And the blade doesnt bog down at all when going through longer thicker hair .</li>
    <li> I like this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time on all my clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Smells great. Lasts. Fair price.</li>
    <li> Really keeps my clipper&#x27;s working sense I bought them great price great delivery and keeps clippers working like new every time</li>
    <li> Smells good. It cleanses and lubricates my clippers. It also disinfects the clippers. And it&#x27;s an Andis product. Which Andis carry great products.</li>
    <li> This spray is the best. It dose exactly what it says. My clippers run a lot cooler and smoother. Thanks andis.cooler</li>
    <li> I use this when clipping my doggy which takes some time and of course the blade get pretty warm.  This spray cools and lubricates the blade at the same time.  Not really Cool Cool, if that makes sense, but I guess not as hot (warm).  It&#x27;s a alcohol base, so you smell that when you spray it.  But I find that it makes the job a bit easier.</li>
    <li> Good multi purpose liquid to lube up clean and maintain clippers and trimmers. i would definately recommend to barbers for use.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I spray my clippers while they&#x27;re in the on position for a few seconds after every shave (~1-2 times weekly).  Works well.</li>
    <li> Absolutely necessary with all the blades. It made the difference while trimming my long haired Malamutes and Newfoundland dogs. Important to allow blades to cool as trimming is done. Otherwise, too hot for the dog&#x27;s skin. Patience required, while trimming.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this. Not too strong.</li>
    <li> A good general purpose lubricant disinfectant for shavers and clippers. Good product for its purpose. I recommend it and am pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Keeps my blades cool, can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> big can.  great for cleaning and disinfecting any type of metal.  Keeps clippers running much cooler than regular oil alone.</li>
    <li> I was at a barbershop and saw the barber using this very stuff to clean and lubricate his electric clippers. My hubby has tried baby oil, WD40, and canned air after he ran out of the oil that came with his home clippers. I like this option much better. It sanitizes too. Imagine my surprise when I found it on Amazon. Woo hoo!</li>
    <li> Good for cleaning all clipper in the house. NO problem at all with it ... A MUST HAVE IN THE HOUSE IF YOU CUT HAIR</li>
    <li> The first use of my new clippers was on a cat&#x27;s backside that wasn&#x27;t exactly pristine.  I thought I&#x27;d ruined the clipper head but this cleaner broke it loose and left it shiny and odor free!  Good product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  A bottle of oil/cleaner came with the unit, so I didn&#x27;t need this, but you can&#x27;t see what all is included in the clipper box, so now I can&#x27;t return this because it is flammable.  So how come Amazon can ship flammable to the consumer, but we can&#x27;t ship it back.  Just another rip off!!!</li>
    <li> Sort of expensive, but seems to work well for cleaning and lubricating the clippers. Recommend for professionals or heavy clipper use at home.</li>
    <li> Hubby uses this stuff on the dog trimmer as he takes care of our doggies hair cutting needs. Last a long time.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped quickly! Have used it multiple times while grooming my dog.Works as it states.Would recommend this product highly!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Does exactly what it say...cleans, lubricate, and cools down the clipper blades.  Its 63% ethanol alcohol...Turns those blades ice cold almost instantly.  I use it on my Andis Clipper and trimmer all the time when I cut my hair.  5 star.</li>
    <li> Ending up getting these because the reviews said the Andis Clippers would get too hot after some time.  Actually have not needed to use it because i bought the Andis Clipper Comb (guards).  These don&#x27;t get hot and provide me with a ton of control when cutting my dogs hair.  That being said this spray works just fine.</li>
    <li> Figured I&#x27;d save some money and buy this brand thinking an antiseptic is an antiseptic. That may be true but I only got to use this a hand full of times before the spray cap broke off.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, cools clippers when they get hot but I used it for cleaning clipper blades, which is another use for this product. I like to pour some in the top of the can and put my clipper blade in there and turned on the clippers to shake out the fine hair and then put back the liquid in the can that isn&#x27;t dirty... great product.</li>
    <li> I got the spray only because it was an addon for about five dollars; that being said, this is almost an essential if you are purchasing the T-Outliners. The blades get hot really fast, but the spray will cool them right down.</li>
    <li> no complaints. Happy with the product and the seller</li>
    <li> This does help to cool the clipper blades when they start to get hot!  Still need to use oil to lubricate the blades.</li>
    <li> 5 stars. for anyone who grooms animals , this stuff is great.. cools the blade and sanitzes at the same time&lt;br /&gt;love everything about it including smell&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Prior to using this I was using oils recommended from the manufacturer. Not only did the oils not lubricate my clipper blades enough it lodged in debris and accelerated deterioation of the blades. I went through 3 clippers in the past 2 years because of this. I decided to look for altnerative and came upon this. This spray is easily applied with no mess and extra residue. Now I can feel confident my blades will last me for a few years.</li>
    <li> The product does what they say it will do.  I have found that as I use a detachable blade system and continually change blades they never get anything more than warm.</li>
    <li> We use this spray each time we groom our goldendoodle.  It makes a big difference, instantly cooling the blades and thus making our dog comfortable as we work.  Some have complained about the fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t bother us...  It smells like soap, and the scent disappears completely by the time you&#x27;re finished grooming.</li>
    <li> I will spray it on sometimes even durring a cut. Works good. l l l l l l l l</li>
    <li> I bought this item but haven&#x27;t  had a chance to use it yet, I &#x27;m sure it is as good as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several different clippers and have used the Andis Cool Care Plus on all of them. Love the stuff. If your clippers are loud, or seem to get louder as you use them, it&#x27;s likely they are not lubricated properly. A quick spray of this solves the issue, lubricating and cooling the blades. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with rust on blades I&#x27;ve used this with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much - a little goes a long way (I went through a pair of clippers before I used the first bottle I ever purchased.) I also worked for several years in a pet supply store and sold this to several professional groomers and customers who groomed their own pets. All reported this product worked great and I never had a return of it - except from one customer who realized that her dog was a biter around clippers and she tipped her groomer more as a result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historically I&#x27;ve owned several long haired dogs who required at least some seasonal grooming around their ears &amp; paw areas if not entire haircuts with clippers. In addition to the clippers for my dogs, I have a pair I use for haircuts/trims and a rechargeable trimmer I use on facial hair several times a week - the Andis Cool Care Plus works equally well on them. Blades are cool to the touch after a quick shot, work much quieter and seem to last longer than clippers on which I&#x27;ve used the oil packed in with the clippers. I do one quick spray before use, another midway through (on bigger jobs requiring extended use) and another quick spray just before I&#x27;m done - and I routinely clean the stray hairs out of the clippers before packing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t a favorite of all people, but in many cases I&#x27;ve found if you&#x27;re overwhelmed by the scent you&#x27;re probably using too much.</li>
    <li> Clean your blades after using and spritz with a lube to keep your blades sharp and clean.  I hate finding blades that have been left dirty!</li>
    <li> This works just fine.  it keeps the clippers oiled and I am confident that its cleaning them as well. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to work great. It really does cool the blades instantly and lubricates as expected. Hopefully it will increase the life of the blade.</li>
    <li> This spray keeps your blades nice and cool, well lubed and clean.  I use it every few minutes while clipping (I have a fine textured long haired cat) and it works well.  The &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; leaves a little to be desired but it&#x27;s not terrible - that&#x27;s purely subjective.</li>
    <li> I love this! I will order some more. It smells good too!!!</li>
    <li> Shipped quick and made razor work much better. Really need this for our stiff wire hair german sheppard.</li>
    <li> Absolute must for clippers!  I clip 4 horses and 2 dogs regularly!</li>
    <li> I bought this for when i cut my dog&#x27;s hair. It is supposed to cool the blade of the electrical trimmer (which i feel it does really well). It is also a huge bottle which i think will last a long long time!! For the price, it is a good deal! However, my only dislike is the smell. It doesnt smell bad. But if you want an odorless spray, this is definitely NOT the one to get. I think it is an okay smell, but sometimes it can be a bit much when you are spraying down the blade a lot. Not bad, dont get me wrong. Just wish it came with an odorless smell as an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall thoughts: Get it. It is worth the money and the bottle is huge. It will last you a long time and you can deal with the smell of the spray. It isnt bad. It cools down the blade and also lubricates it so that cutting your pet&#x27;s hair will be easier. Good deal.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Plus it smells great too. Keeps my clipper blades cool, even if I&#x27;m clipping 10 dogs and cats at a time. Blades stay sharp longer too.</li>
    <li> Great product for professional use, keeps my blades sharp and cool. Its also a great size so it will last long</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I am overly sensitive to perfume. But imagine yourself trapped in an elevator with 10 elderly ladies with heavy perfume on. That is how this stuff smells. One whiff and I threw it in the trash can. It is getting harder to find products these days that aren&#x27;t loaded with perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this stuff work? I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
    <li> love it, keeps blade clean and cold</li>
    <li> Used it on the clipper. I hope it disinfects as it claims time will tell .  It does cool the clipper.</li>
    <li> Five Stars Works great!!!</li>
    <li> I use this for both of my clipper sets and it works great!</li>
    <li> A  very good product, and I see it is used in many salons.  Kind of a big can though.  It will probably out last me!&lt;br /&gt;Or my hair, whichever goes first....</li>
    <li> Works well for cooling but don&#x27;t use it as a replacement for oil.</li>
    <li> Great product, does what it says it will do. Applied spray to my clipper blades and it conditions them to excellent condition. Makes clipping easier and cuts hair easily without grabbing or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have for all your clippers. It&#x27;s an all-in-one that makes a huge difference. I will buy more of this when needed. Don&#x27;t pass this up, it works better than just oiling the blades. It cleans the blades and then conditions them just like it was oil!!</li>
    <li> Works well! Be sure to still use clipper oil on the blades as well. This product can only do s much before the blade begins to heat up.</li>
    <li> Like the price is very easy to use the full weight</li>
    <li> I bought Cool Care for my expensive hair clippers, which had begun to rust, and also tried the product on a nose and ear hair trimmer that had frozen up and was headed for the trash - and Cool Care worked. This comes in a big 15.5 oz. can that I expect will last for years - plus I like the clean fragrance (sort of smells like hairspray).</li>
    <li> I am not a barber, but own a pair of Andis T-Outliner clippers for lining up my beard and neck. This product is the most trusted of barbers and will most likely see it in any barber shop you go to. The smell is great too!</li>
    <li> I use it just as it was intended which is to cool the blades off and lubricate the blades also.</li>
    <li> does as advertised. it cools and lubricates the blades on my pet clippers that i use. would buy again.</li>
    <li> Have used this product in the past when I worked in a grooming shop. It really helps when you don&#x27;t have extra blades.</li>
    <li> Way better than cool lube</li>
    <li> Andis 12750 Cool Care Plus certainly helps to cool the clipper blades &amp; keep them from burning the dogs. This helps cool!</li>
    <li> i bring this to my barber every time i go. i also use this for my own clippers at home also. it does everything it advertises and then some. it prevents rust too. thanks to this my andis t outliner blade is on its tenth year and still sharp and accurate.</li>
    <li> You have to order this if your using the Andis for 3 hours like I did, used it about every 10 minutes and kept the blade cool.</li>
    <li> I have been using clipper for a while and have always used the oil tube provided by the manufacture. Using the manufacture provided tube to apply the right amount of oil to the blade is a hassle. With the spray the application is much easier. it&#x27;s not too oily either. Spray after every use and in between the use! Happy with this.</li>
    <li> Cooled the blades down almost immediately enabling us to not wait the recommended 20 minutes cooling down of the clipper.</li>
    <li> If you cut your own hair or cut others it&#x27;s better to subscribe on Amazon the best product to use to clean your clippers before and after a cut</li>
    <li> Arrive pretty fast and really helpful to cool it off</li>
    <li> I have a set of professional clippers and this is great for cleaning and lubing during a cut. Smell brings you back to a barbershop and works great on the fly. I use straight lube for storage and detailed maintenance, but this is great for during the cut. Also cools the blade down and it dries fast.</li>
    <li> This cool care plus spray is a really good product to use on electrical shavers and clippers. It&#x27;s a good spray in disinfecting and lubrication. Many barbers use this spray and suggest using it.</li>
    <li> Exactly like described. Excellent buy, and service!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always seen my barber for the last 10 years use this product in his machines. After trying it I think it&#x27;s great for any electric shaving devices. It helps lubricate and disinfect at the same time. Awesome product will be buying again once I&#x27;m done!</li>
    <li> Seemed to work well, worth the money</li>
    <li> My wife clips our dog every month and this is a must to keep the clippers clean and cool.  We must have gone thru at least 10 cans of this good stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great - cleans the razor blades like wd40, smells nice, and cools the razor before using. Just don&#x27;t get it in your nostrils.</li>
    <li> Great quality and smell</li>
    <li> I use this every time I use my clippers.  It keeps the blade from getting too hot and also keeps the blades clean and oiled.  I believe it has made my clippers last longer and has kept them in better shape.  I would higly recommend this for anyone that does clipping!!</li>
    <li> Price was good , and product works great. A lot easier to use, the squeeze bottles of cleaner and oil are messy .</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should.  I learned about this from a Grooming DVD I purchased.  The blades do tend to get very hot when I am cutting my miniature poodle&#x27;s curly coat and this product cools it down quickly.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> As lubricant it&#x27;s very good, but not this good as blade cooler. Recommend you to have 2 or more blades (same size), so when it get warm, you change it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but from what I&#x27;ve seen so far, it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! 10/10 Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Lubricates the blade, but does not cool down the blade. I wanted something to cool the blade so that I could continue to groom my dog without waiting for the blade to cool.  This product did not do the job. If you are just looking for lubrication, this product will work for that.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product yet. It was recommended in the promotional literature... Maybe I&#x27;ll use it next summer, when the weather is hot and sticky.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> If you own clippers you need this to clean them. Nice clean scent too. It&#x27;s a big can so it should last a while.</li>
    <li> No issues with this product. It cools, cleans, disinfects, prevents rust, and lubricates as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought a can of this after reading the reviews, it works very well. I never bought any other kind to compare it with but I would buy this again. It just makes the blade glide through like butter and it keeps it cool. I thought the price was very reasonable also.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times. I used it on my andis when it was super hot and to my surprise it cooled my clippers down so fast. Not only is it a disinfectant,  but it&#x27;s also a lubracant. I don&#x27;t think it should take the place of oil though. It also has a very good smell. I joked around and said my husband should use this for his cologne.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. Cleans / disinfects / smells good too.</li>
    <li> Great product and does what it supposed to do!</li>
    <li> This product cools the clippers down when you are cutting for a while.  You don&#x27;t want your pet to get uncomfortable. Or worse, get burned.</li>
    <li> Excellent for maintaining germ and bacteria free clippers of all kind. Good for lubrication of clippers as well.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Defiantly will purchase again! Sanitary hospital type of smell. Works just as described! kept blades cool, clean&amp; lubercated  the entire time I trimmed both my cocker spaniel and schnauzer! 👍🐩</li>
    <li> Cools and lubricates as promised.</li>
    <li> Larger can than I was expecting. My previous can was maybe at most 6oz and lasted me several years... I can not even being to think how long this can will last me. I would guess I am set for 6-8 years. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> very Good and Good price</li>
    <li> Great product for all clippers</li>
    <li> If you use clippers and/or an electric shaver, this will help ensure the good maintenance &amp; longevity of their blades &amp; foil. I currently use a Braun electric shaver which has a cleaning base, but my Norelco Body Groomer doesn&#x27;t. Furthermore, I use the Norelco in the shower all the time, as well as for intimate grooming with a shaving gel. The combination of wet-shaving, hot water rinsing &amp; product residue these shavers get leaves me baffled as to why they don&#x27;t come with cleaning stations as well but [[ASIN:B000LNB8HK Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades]] solves the problem. Think of it along the lines of barbicide in a compressed canister with a lubricating oil additive that&#x27;ll clean, disinfect &amp; lubricate the foil and blades on your shaver. Use especially after you rinse your unit. The compressed air is quite strong so be sure you secure any loose blades or parts before you spray it on if you open your shaver. I give a quick spray with the shaver turned on &amp; let it get into the blades for a few seconds. One can should go a long way. I have a Wahl hair clipper set that I use this on as well.    It has a sort of light, \\&quot;old school\\&quot; scent you associate with barber shops &amp; locker rooms. It doesn&#x27;t bother me but bear in mind this is not fragrance-free, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> Lubricates and sanitizes! Only used on clipper used on one dog but it helps keep the clipper head cool and lubricated to extend the life of the head.</li>
    <li> The Andis product caused oxidation on my first set of clippers.  I just purchased a new pair of expensive clippers and the teacher at the barber college told me not to use the Andis product for that reason.  They recommend using Clippercide spray in the orange can.  I read the ingredients listed on the cans and it appears that Andis uses ethanol and Clippercide uses isopropyl.  I would appreciate any comments from others on the oxidation problem.</li>
    <li> Essential for keeping clippers running like new.</li>
    <li> Works as described every time.</li>
    <li> had a bit of rust on my wahl and this spray cleans it right off and leaves it running smooth, my second can actually.</li>
    <li> My fault for not reading the fine print, and just going by what the top of the ad says.  This is a spray can and I was looking for the liquid can.  I can still use it just not how I planned.  The spray tends to get it all over my kitchen table where the liquid I could just dunk the blade without the mess.  My fault for not completely reading all the fine print.</li>
    <li> Cools down the blades, makes the  clippers easier to clean.  Great product, not heavy. container allows just a drop where needed.</li>
    <li> First time grooming my pet, I followed the recommendations of my friend, used it often and we had no problems.  We probably spent almost 2 hours on this first endeavor, getting the hang of it, which is probably a LONG grooming session for the animal and the equipment, but everythihng worked fine.</li>
    <li> The clippers i have are very fast so they get very hot,the cool care plus works as it states.I used it several times during clipping my dog.</li>
    <li> This product does as it states, it cools down the electric razor.  I use my razor on six shaggy dogs and after the first, it begins to heat up.  This product not only wipes off the hair but keeps the razor cool enough that my next dog getting a haircut is a happy one!</li>
    <li> Smells nice and cools/cleans the blades. Does not cool instantly tho, so let blades sit for a few mins after spraying.</li>
    <li> not sure if it works have check with my dogs</li>
    <li> fast shipping work awesome.</li>
    <li> I use a ceramic blade and this product keeps them quiet and clean. .I will definitely keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> This product is an absolute MUST if you are grooming your pet....It instantly cools off an extremely hot blade... Could not groom my dog without it.</li>
    <li> Good product….great price…fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Everyone need to get this asap</li>
    <li> Very happy with the Cool Care. Very happy Very Happy Very Happy 8 more words and we got it made.</li>
    <li> I like it. It met my needs. I would higly recommend your service to anyone in need of your products.</li>
    <li> This product really works. At first upon reading about the product I thought it was used basically to cool down your clipper blades when they get hot while using. But it also creates a oily based film which helps lubricates and protect the blades as well. Great product, worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Much easier to apply oil to my cat&#x27;s Wahl 9590-210 than it is to use the little, tiny bottle of oil that came with the trimmer. AND it disinfects AND prevents rust. If you own any type of a hair trimmer, Andis Cool Care Plus is very good stuff! Has a nice scent (as engine oil goes..) too! Big can! I won&#x27;t have to buy this again for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever invented!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years with my dog grooming clippers. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> It is ok, I have not really used it much.</li>
    <li> This works amazing, this is my second bottle first I bought for me and a friend asked me to get him this one, really helps while buzzing along. As advertised, this is not an oil, but def a lubricant to HELP in between oiling your Andis. Cools the blades nicely and above all smells clean. I highly recommend for the price, it will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> I used to trim my cat&#x27;s coat and he has a very thick undercoat and the trimmers would get so hot that it would burn my hands. I bought this and it even cooled the trimmers down.</li>
    <li> This is so nice! It really does work well in cooling and disinfecting my equipment! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I use this for my Andis T-Outliner Trimmer and there&#x27;s not much to say about it. I spray it on my blades and they stay cool and clean. I typically spray this on my blades about 2 or 3 times during a shave and it does not irritate my skin. It burns very slightly occasionally, but nothing at all like a powerful alcohol burn you would expect from a product like this. If you own clippers, you should use this.</li>
    <li> This can of cooling spray for electric clippers is great! It immediately cools down the hot metal clipper blade. It&#x27;s easy to use and I think one can lasts a long time. The only slightly negative is the scent. It&#x27;s smells good &amp; clean, but is kinda strong and can make me &amp;/or my dogs sneeze.</li>
    <li> still trying to get the hand of the clipper...!</li>
    <li> I always get these for my Clippers but price is a little bit less here then it is in the stores -  great product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped</li>
    <li> Works great.  Definitely helps cool off my Andis clipper after it&#x27;s been running for a while and makes it possible to trim our dog without burning or making him uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good buy.</li>
    <li> These are great for clipping my dogs nails as I&#x27;m embarking on learning how to groom my dog so that I can save $$$$!</li>
    <li> Our dog has sensitive skin and hot clipper blades are a no-no!  Just a quick spray every now and then helps keep the blades cool and  disinfected when going from dog to dog.  No dog lover should trim clip without it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the buzzer definetly works much better, and cooler using this product. I would definitley buy this again. Reccomend.</li>
    <li> Works as described, like how it cleans and cools at the same time, so I know my pup is safe during hair cuts.</li>
    <li> This spray works pretty good. It does what it says it supposed to do. It cools down the blades when they get very hot from trimming. It also helps to lubricate and protect the blades. The only thing I wish is that they would sell medium size bottles for individual pet owners.  I have only one dog and this bottle is quite big and you don&#x27;t use a whole lot each time, so it is lasting me a long time. Perhaps, it is a good thing if it doesn&#x27;t loose its effectiveness with time. Otherwise, I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It actually keeps the blade cool so I can take my time grooming my poodle which is very helpful while I&#x27;m leaning. ..</li>
    <li> Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
    <li> Works great to cool the blade on my Andis blade.  I&#x27;m sure my dog appreciates the special attention I pay to his comfort.  I&#x27;ve given my Golden Retriever two hair cuts this summer.  I believe this can will last at least 3 years.  I spray the blade about 5-8 times per hair cut.</li>
    <li> Great for my clippers!</li>
    <li> This work good so far its an all in one product  that oil lubricates, clean and sanitizes all in one.</li>
    <li> Good price, great value type of product. I just don&#x27;t like the smell of it. Wouldn&#x27;t use it in a small area with minimal ventilation. Other than that, it does what it advertises.</li>
    <li> Does what it suppose to do, cleans and cools all blades fast... Will recommend this product for all serious barbers!</li>
    <li> got this when i got my andis and it was a recommended bundle. first time i got the recommended bundle. really works. bc the non-ceramic blades do heat up and the one i use a lot size 10 is non-ceramic and cuts really close to the skin so can really save fido some pain</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my home clipper blades for a few months.  I definitely don&#x27;t miss using clipper oil.  Just spray on and the blades stay clean and cool.</li>
    <li> A great help for clippers!</li>
    <li> With 3 dogs to shave my blades can get hot and this works really good to cool them off.  Would recommend it for fast cool down.</li>
    <li> Cools,cleans, and helps protect your investment.</li>
    <li> I really like this item... Very handy when everyone wants a haircut very good quality</li>
    <li> Just what I needed at a great price.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of cleaning the blade and cooling it as well. An awesome multipurpose product. Lubricates as well which is a plus. Big can lasts a long time. I enjoy the smell it has as well haha reminds me of a nice clean barbershop  odor.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cool the clippers for very long</li>
    <li> works well but tended to get dirty fast when using so you have to keep spraying so hope that was helpful</li>
    <li> when the clippers started to get hot a little spray &amp; we were ready to cut again...</li>
    <li> Again, I was very dissapointed, wish I could have seen the warnings on the can before I purchased it.  I will not be using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It keeps my clippers clean and cool!! However, i noticed that it has a very strong smell but it smells good anyway. Keeps my clippers running cool longer.</li>
    <li> When i first ordered it, it said it would come by May 30, i came home May 23 to see a box, i thought it was a bomb, i opened it &amp; it was my andis cool care!!!! Packaged perfectly, works great, and cheap, what do you have to lose</li>
    <li> Keeps the clippers clean and sharp.</li>
    <li> Good Product for any clipper!</li>
    <li> Great product use it every time.</li>
    <li> Works great, really cools down the clippers so I can keep cutting?</li>
    <li> Does the job!  Keeps the clippers clean and clear of hair!</li>
    <li> smells good. does a good job of cooling the blades</li>
    <li> Got it today, thank you.</li>
    <li> Worth the Money, works and cools like it should.</li>
    <li> Works well to sterilize and cool down my clippers.</li>
    <li> Simply spray and go. I have to trust that it kills the germs and bacteria that it claims. And it seems to lubricate both pair (Wahl adjustables and Andis T-outliners) just fine.</li>
    <li> This works good to cool hot clipper blades along with keeping them clean!</li>
    <li> Essential spray if you cut hair.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as described.  Delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with my Andis Outliner II and it works just fine. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad (same stuff my long time barber uses so I guess I&#x27;m use to it). It&#x27;s not really a loud smell or anything like that...I believe a lot of folks are exaggeratting on their reviews but to each his own. As far as how I use it I spray some on after I&#x27;m done shaving let my clippers run for a bit and then I hang my clippers with the blads facing downward to let it dry, if I&#x27;m cutting my hair then I spray a little on between sections because my hair cut time is a lot longer than my shave time. Afterwards I spray and hang. Oh one thing...this stuff is flamable so if you&#x27;re going to spray this stuff with your clippers running make sure you&#x27;re holding your clippers downward so the spray doesn&#x27;t drip into the internal section of the clippers (had it ignite on me once) also you don&#x27;t really need a whole bunch. Normal regular use should keep your clippers in great condition for years to come. Does it help keep the blades cool, most definitely. Have at it!!</li>
    <li> purchased to be put into a pet grooming kit for a pet loving friend.  I would recommend this item to consumers.</li>
    <li> excelent quality, and very good service, thanks</li>
    <li> Good product to use if you have multiple dogs to groom as the blades will get hot after awhile and this cools them down and keeps your pet from feeling hot clipper blades.</li>
    <li> This is a rather pricy cleaner/solvent that cleans up your favorite clippers.  Does a great job and keeps the blade from getting hot.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is a requirement to buy this stuff when you are using professional grade clippers. Without them you will most certainly burn your pet from the heat of friction.</li>
    <li> I sprayed a bit of this on my wahl heros and had them running to it&#x27;s full power. Works great on any pair of clippers, but make sure you follow the instructions on how to properly use the spray to keep the blades strong and last longer.</li>
    <li> When it comes to making sure my clippers are clean and kept cool, I look no further than Andis Cool Care. From my experience, it is some of the best preservative for clippers out there. When customers see you using it, they know they are safe from irritation or whatever else may lay on uncleaned clippers. Always use this before and after each haircut.</li>
    <li> My barber uses this stuff on his expensive clippers and says it extends  cutter life and leaves little residue.  He&#x27;s right.</li>
    <li> This a good product and does exactly what it supposed to do.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> Recommend using with any and all clippers. Turn clippers off, spray and wait less then a minute and blades are cool enough to continue clipping</li>
    <li> Great for big and small eclectic razors.  It helped my mustache trimmer run smoother.</li>
    <li> Makes your clippers last longer and kills the bacteria that gives bumps or rashes.  Good to have for any barber.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this often when cutting his hair</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time, not messy like some others</li>
    <li> Great for keeping blades cool</li>
    <li> The Cool Care spray kept my Andis 2 speed trimmer cool and lubricated just as advertised. I made my first trimming experience a pleasure for me and my dog. Thanks Andis</li>
    <li> works great smells wonderful and makes the job a lot easier</li>
    <li> Its oils and disinfects your clippers with ease.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this! It helped so much with my very first grooming session with my 15 lb maltipoo.  I could tell when he was feeling the heat of the blade too much.  When this occurred I stopped immediately, sprayed the cool care, groomed another part of his body with scissors and thengwent back to using the trimmer.  The cooling effect was almost instantaneous.  It was absolutely worth the price. I paid $10.99 + tax at my local pet store. I also found it at a national chain beauty supply store for $8.99.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this to lubricant blades and to keep blades cool!</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and use Andis Envy clippers and trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;I spray this on the blades of the clippers and trimmers and expect it to sanitize, cool down, and lubricate the blades after haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;When I used to go to a barber, all of them had this spray at their shop. I would have to say for the price, it&#x27;s a good warranty for your clippers long term usability. If a million people use this product, you can&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
    <li> works great on cleaning disinfecting and more for all your razors</li>
    <li> Excellent and cheaper than I can get it locally</li>
    <li> Excellent for cleaning clipper blades on all kinds of electric trimmers - from tiny nose hair trimmers to full-sized, professional hair clippers (pet clippers too).  Acts as a coolant, disinfectant, lubricant and cleaner.  I use in between trimming and mainly to keep irritation to a minimum.  Also importantly kills any nasty bugs (viruses, fungi, bacteria).  Makes a huge difference in reducing irritation.  As this spray is not as viscous as regular oil, I additionally add some traditional clipper oil (See Andis Clipper Oil, 4 oz review) to ensure no rust forms after finishing for the day.  Somewhat strong phenol smell requires use in well-ventilated area.</li>
    <li> I like this product, when I am trimming my two schnauzers and the blades start to get warm it helps with the cooling efficiently with oily mess.</li>
    <li> Used this when I gave my german shepherd a trim and it really helped power through that tough coat.  If you&#x27;re having issues this should be on your list to try.</li>
    <li> I bought these with my new Andis clippers and was so happy I did. The clippers (while they worked fantastically) did seem to get warm rather frequently. I just sprayed the Andis Cool Care Plus on the blades and they cooled almost immediately and I was able to get right back to my clip job. I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product along with the grooming tools.  My poodle is much happier now that I grrom her after years of going to a groomer.</li>
    <li> We will only use the Andis brand for our dog clipping needs. So glad we bought this when we bought the clippers. It is needed for the cuts that take a long time (full body cut.) And it has a fresh smell that is pleasing to the nose.</li>
    <li> When the clippers get hot - spray with this stuff.  Spray dries in about 10 seconds.  Clippers probably will be cool enough to use again.  If not, repeat.  Seems to lubricate the clippers well, too.</li>
    <li> Good to keep hair clippers well oiled and sanitized.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it will do</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff!</li>
    <li> First time using it, I knew it was the one.  After cutting my hair, the clippers tend to get hot so I tried this product.  It not only cooled the clippers, but release a pleasant scent.  Satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works great with my Andis clippers.</li>
    <li> Great but it sounds shipping been using for years on on my clippers</li>
    <li> If you have clippers, do yourself a favor and pick some of this up.  It will keep your tools clean and in tip-top shape so that you can be sure that they will perform to their fullest the next time you go to use them.  Simple to use - no excuse not to have some on hand.</li>
    <li> Great product for your Andis clippers. True to it&#x27;s description. A must buy for groomers.</li>
    <li> Really helps to clean your blades when you&#x27;re done clipping. Also helps to lube them as well. I don&#x27;t even use the oil anymore for lubing my blades as it makes things more difficult when trying to clean. Would definitely recommend this to barbers or anyone who cuts hair</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it works how it says it will work! I love it when you buy a product that does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> This stuff just works.  I recommend you spray it in a safe place (maybe outside) because it&#x27;s got kind of an oily consistency, and will probably make a mess if you&#x27;re not super careful.  it really sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a waterproof shaver, and I rinse the blades quickly under running water, then shake it off and spray it with this stuff.  Sometimes I will bust out the shaver brush, but usually the spray does the job of breaking the hair junk down, and it&#x27;s helped to keep my shaver working great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for an awesome product at a pretty decent price.</li>
    <li> I have 2 pom&#x27;s and this really helps cleaning and keeping the clippers cool and helps with static cling shock.</li>
    <li> I have 4 Miniature Schnauzers, so there is always someone that needs clipped.  This cooling / lubricant spray works wonderfully.  I had a set of blades that was about a year old, but they weren&#x27;t cutting well, even with using clipper oil on them.  I thought they were getting dull.  I sprayed this on them, and they instantly started moving (the back and forth motion) faster, and more quietly.  They are cutting like brand new again.  I will be ordering more of this to keep on hand.  Highly recommended !!!</li>
    <li> This product cleans and deodorizes your blades well and it smells sooooo GOOD!  Use it carefully on your blades as it dries them out.  Follow-up with blade oil.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who is a barber who uses this product on the regular.  He loves this product and has been using it for a long time but found that the price through amazon is cheaper than buying it in a store locally.  The shipping was fast and we recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Extend the life of your clippers/body shavers. Nothing else works better.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Nice to have a few products in one. My wife loves the smell of this stuff too. Reminds me of being at my barbers. Excellent stuff</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greasy and not that easy to use.  Gotta spray it and wait a nite before u can use. It doesnt cool down blades instantly.</li>
    <li> great stuff,will buy it again</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because I have been using this product since 2002. It does a really good job on cooling, disinfecting, and keeping the machines running smoothly. Don&#x27;t forget to always oil the blades of your clippers and shavers after every use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as it was recommended by Andis for use on the clippers I purchased.  I guess it works OK, but is very overpriced and has an unpleasant odor.  The clippers, by the way, were a complete disappointment too.&lt;br /&gt;Andis is highly rated in most reviews, but I am certainly not impressed.</li>
    <li> Works great to cool down the blade and lubricate at the same time.</li>
    <li> Great product and I love using it BUT don&#x27;t buy it online. Sally&#x27;s Beauty supplies sells it for less. Will be buying it there from now on. Seller was great in shipping it out as soon as payment cleared.</li>
    <li> Good Product... Don&#x27;t smell bad either</li>
    <li> Always a great product</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this brand yet as I am finishing up  another brand.  Hope this one is just as good.  Have purchased 2 cans of it tho.</li>
    <li> This Cool Care spray is used for my Andis T-Outliner clippers that I use to shave to keep myself clean cut. The spray is to help clean the blade &amp; ultimately allow the clippers to live longer. A worthwhile product to have along with the clippers. For the price I paid, It last a long time. I only use the spray on 1 clipper that I use to shave myself with. I am no barber &amp; I am very satisfied with this product for it&#x27;s longevity with me.</li>
    <li> this product is good to use with any make of hair trimmers or cutters. it lubes, protects against rust and disenfects all in one application.</li>
    <li> Found this item to be useful in prevtenting the dog from feeling the heat from clippers on his skin.  I would recommed it.</li>
    <li> The spray helps to keep the clipper blades cool, lubricated and clean.  I used it before, during and after clipped our border collie.</li>
    <li> Great product cools clippers and sanitizes.</li>
    <li> We were advised by several groomers to purchase this spray along with our new Andis Clipper.  It&#x27;s just great - allows us to spray the blades when they get warm and just keep going.  Never would have thought about this product if groomers had not given use such great advice.</li>
    <li> i love this product. Its very helpful and i love it very much since im an aspiring groomer. Thank you</li>
    <li> The product is very easy to use, very fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I asked for.</li>
    <li> great at keeping the blades cool and clean during groom sessions :)</li>
    <li> Good to cool those hot blades so they don&#x27;t burn your furbaby.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but kinda cheaper in stores</li>
    <li> A must have for any clippers. Cools and makes blades run so smoothly. Instantly!</li>
    <li> I would not have bought Andis Cool Care Plus spray if the ingredients had been listed on Amazon (something I would like to see both Amazon &amp; sellers do on any product used on or around humans or animals).  This spray contains o-PHENYLPHENOL, a chemical that is described on Andis Cool Care Plus&#x27;s can in this way: \\&quot;ATTENTION: This product contains o-phenylphenol, a product known to the State of California to cause cancer in accordance to Proposition 65 (State of California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986)\\&quot;  It seems to me that with regular use of this spray on dog clippers, some amount of this substance would be spread through my dog&#x27;s fur and onto her skin (or in it if she gets nicked), and would sit there between baths (and humans would be exposed when petting dog). My dog needs to be trimmed frequently. I would not feel right about regularly using this around my dog or myself, and I certainly would not want either of us to inhale even the small amount of the spray that would need to be applied so frequently. I would have researched the ingredients before purchase, but it never occurred to me that a spray to which both my dog and I would be exposed would contain an ingredient known to be toxic. Now, I know that this is a widely used chemical, and that it&#x27;s possible that the amount of the ingredient in the spray may not be very high (though I have no way of knowing the amount it contains), but these days we all are exposed to enough toxic substances that I would not knowingly expose my dog or myself to another unnecessarily. I will look for other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the can, I did not use the spray, so I cannot say whether or not it works. I have read, however, that you can also cool your blade by resting it against a small piece of tile or marble, or spraying it with compressed air. I plan to try those methods. UPDATE 7/23/14: After using my clippers on an infected dog, I wanted to disinfect them before using again, and since thisproduct&#x27;s can said it was also a disinfectant, I used it as directed to disinfect the clippers(and noticed that it did indeed seem to cool the blade somewhat; and it smells pleasant). So because it does cool as it says (tho I won&#x27;t be using it for that), and because I was glad to have an easy to use disinfectant on hand, I&#x27;ve raised my rating to 3 stars. But I still will not expose my dogs or others to frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this product is not returnable to amazon for any reason because of the type of material it is. I forget the wording of Amazon&#x27;s statement about this, but I suggest checking into it before purchasing if you&#x27;re concerned.</li>
    <li> this keeps your trimmer humming along fine.  with two dogs with long fur, i have to have a good trimmer and keep it moving along smoothly.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> This helped cool down the blade so much faster than just letting it sit. I sprayed it on the blade, let it evaporate, and then repeated if it still wasn&#x27;t cooled down enough. I am really thankful I bought this at the same time as the clippers!</li>
    <li> What a great price! I use this to keep my blades cool when grooming my mini schnauzers.  This is half the price I pay locally.</li>
    <li> Works well to cool and clean clipper blades during a cut.</li>
    <li> This cools the pet clippers so the clippers don&#x27;t get too hot when clipping my dogs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are other items similar to this one, however, when a product works the way you want it to work, then there is no  reason not to purchase it. Besides that, the seller was accurate about the dates the items would arrive. I recommend this product and purchasing from this seller.</li>
    <li> I keep these as a coolant for my clippers when I&#x27;m cutting hair. Do not use this as a primary lubricant though. You still need oil!</li>
    <li> This is a must if you own an Andis master because of how hot it gets. I love it and a bonus is it smells good.</li>
    <li> Easy use, this is a must have if you have clippers..  Clean easy to use wish I had found this sooner</li>
    <li> FAST DELIVERY. GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> Wow, i didnt realize this was going to be that big but great product nonetheless, is definitely keeping my blades so fresh and so clean!</li>
    <li> I was happy with this product. It worked but since I had 4 dogs to groom consecutively I also used an ice pack out of my freezer to help cool down the blade faster so I could get all my dogs groomed in 1 day. It is a good product and I am happy I had it to help keep the blades cooled down.</li>
    <li> It arrived earlier than expected even though it was delivered to the wrong house.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing the price is good for 15.5 oz.  I bought it as I also bought the clipper set (boyfriend&#x27;s birthday).</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works well on Andis Clippers.  I also use it to keep my shears and combs clean.  I would have given it five stars, but delivered with a broken cap and annoying to not be able to snap it closed in my grooming bag.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Cools my grooming clippers down very quickly so they don&#x27;t burn my baby when I&#x27;m cutting her hair (Labradoodle &#x3D; lots of hair!).  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a spray like this for years but couldn&#x27;t find the brand I&#x27;ve always used and bought this instead. This stuff cools, cleans, lubricates, and sterilizes the blades all at the same time. You don&#x27;t need to remove the blades, just spray with the clippers running and it does it&#x27;s job.  It has a scent added to it that may be a bit perfumy for some people. This large can should last at least a couple of years.</li>
    <li> What the barbers use for cleaning/lubing their clippers.  It works and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
    <li> Low (but proper) maintenance in a can. I use this with my Andis BGRC razor to disinfect, lubricate, and all that good stuff that every electric razor needs for continued usage. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Keeps blades clean and smells Great.</li>
    <li> cools and lubricates well a must for dog grooming  right price lg. can andis is good products fine fine fine</li>
    <li> I got this alongside my Andis Clipper Oil and they work hand in hand for my Andis trimmer. Really helps to have them so my trimmer can run smoothly for a long time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell if this product even lubes.  It does not feel like it has any oil at all.  I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Clipping horses involves clippers being on and working for hours.  With this coolant, I don&#x27;t have to stop and give the clippers a rest.  Not only does it keep them cool, but the blast clears away a lot of hair and dust, keeping them cleaner and therefore giving them longer life.  This product is my clippers best friend!</li>
    <li> This thing is a must buy when you have clippers, as the blades invariably get hot very fast and need to be lubricated. The best product out there.</li>
    <li> Works as promised. I used this on the shaver that I bought and it lubed it up as promised. I also use this on my shaver cartridged.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff, its a good price and does what its suppose to do! i swear it seems to last a really long time if you use it right. great price and great product!</li>
    <li> Cools and stuff, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if I could have bought it at a hair care store instead, but the price here on Amazon was good enough to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy the ceramic blade, you wont need this -as often- but still, good to have as a cleaner/cooler</li>
    <li> This stuff does lubricate the blade, but it didn&#x27;t really cool it down much that I could tell.  I still had to just turn it off and give my dog a break for at least 20-30 min.</li>
    <li> Great tool to maintain your clippers running.</li>
    <li> Keeps the blade cool like it says.</li>
    <li> cools head down keeps it clean</li>
    <li> Great Item. Works well!</li>
    <li> PROPOSITION 65 - WARNING: This product contains o-phenylphenol a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for something else.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years. I cut my son&#x27;s hair. And this product is an essential - it disinfects and lubricates the clippers. Would purchase again. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> hard to rate, spray it on, wipe it off, simple to use. thats it notyhing else to say. the end</li>
    <li> This product works as described:  it cools, cleans and lubricates.  I use it on my personal grooming clippers as well as the dog clippers.  I highly recommend this spray.</li>
    <li> Great value for money and works well.</li>
    <li> I like this all-in-one formula.  After using my clippers, I use this spray to disinfect and oil my blades.  It keeps my blades clean and running smoothly.</li>
    <li> I am a professional groomer.  I like this product very much except for the smell which is very strong, but it does cool down the blades.</li>
    <li> Wish i&#x27;d bought this sooner instead of just using the clipper oil from Wahl. This will keep you running well, clean, safe, and good to go for a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to clean and cool blades while I trimmed the fur of my dog. I think they help with the cleaning product, but the cooling is only superficial--meaning that it only slightly cooled the surface of the blades. There is a lot of heat stored in the metal and ceramic material as the blades heat up and so after spraying them with this spray, they cooled off a couple of degrees, but then got really hot almost immediately once I started to use the trimmer again.</li>
    <li> This lasted us so long and we used it after every use of our clippers.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really have anything special or particular to say about the product. It does what its supposed to, and without issue.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had them all - and this about the best we&#x27;ve used.  Easy on clippers and keeps them running at optimal speed!  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Use this with the clippers we bought. It works as advertized and we love this product. Still using the same can we purchased about 6 months ago.</li>
    <li> Great product! I am very satisfied.  I use it all the time and I am very happy.  I do my dog&#x27;s grooming and could not live without it!</li>
    <li> Quality Oil that Cools and Lubricates and Disinfectant and a cleaner too.</li>
    <li> Keeps the Blades cool and lubricates at the same time.  Couldn&#x27;t groom without it.  Dries quickly but should you have extra blades available for heavy duty grooming tasks.</li>
    <li> There is nothing that matches this product will definitely reorder</li>
    <li> I use this very often does what it says it does</li>
    <li> Order this product but it never was delivered. Will not buy from Andis again. Customer service was no help.</li>
    <li> I bought this to accompany the Andis pet clipper.  As it turned out, I didn&#x27;t really need it.  It doesn&#x27;t cool the blade as I expected, and the clipper never overheats to that point, anyway.  I would save the money and just go with the fact that the Andis pet clipper is a good purchase without this additional spray.</li>
    <li> It works great, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Been using it for years with no problems.</li>
    <li> Did not cool the blades as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I use this as a cooling spray on the clippers and finishing spray before I put them away.  Fasted way to get your dog to jump is to hit them with hot clippers.</li>
    <li> I should have bought this stuff a long time ago.  Keeps clippers quiet, clean and maintained.  Smells good too.  What&#x27;s not to like ?</li>
    <li> Love Andis products.  Works great</li>
    <li> I think the cooling action works, but it doesn&#x27;t lubricate the clippers as it says it does.  Would love another option, this item is overpriced</li>
    <li> This keeps my razor&#x27;s blades in tip top shape, extends the life, and keeps them cool during prolonged use. Still on my first can, and I&#x27;ve had it for 1 year. I cut my own hair once a week. Just a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I was expecting that this would cool the clippers down faster than it does, but you still have to turn them off and let them sit for awhile after spraying.  The smell is nice and it does help lubricate the blades which is helpful especially on wiggly or big dogs that take longer.  Helpful but not necessary in my opinion.</li>
    <li> It works very well with my Andis Super 2 Speed Dog Clippers. Fast shipper and I will order again. I was surprised that it cooled the blades so quickly.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t order this with the kit because if you don&#x27;t like it they won&#x27;t return it due to it being a liquid.</li>
    <li> Helps cool the blades.  It also sanitizes.  The thing i don&#x27;t trust it to do is lubricate as  well as clipper oil. It also has a pleasant sent.</li>
    <li> this product helped disinfect and helped keep my  clippers running quiet and cool. a great product that I would recommend</li>
    <li> I just started using this and for now I haven&#x27;t really decided weather I would continue using it or not. I can say I have nothing negative to say about it so far.</li>
    <li> Works great to trim the fog the kids call the sheep and trust me it&#x27;s an all day deal. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> Spray works as described and does a very good job at cooling and cleaning the clipper blades. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and realize I have to use something other than alcohol to clean my clippers and trimmers. Bought this stuff it works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sanitary issue. Like with restaurants, you must wash hands for everything. When you cut hair you must clean your clippers after every use.. or when they get too hot you can use this to cool them off almost instantly. These also prevent rust. Would you want your hair cut with a rusty clipper? I don&#x27;t think so! And after use of this product your clippers even smell like they belong to a professional barber.. With ANDIS you MUST become the MASTER of your TRADE! this is just the start!</li>
    <li> This is a great product all five things in one can that gives your clippers longevity. I recommended this product to all who want there clippers to last.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to go aling with the Andis clippers and it works great!  After a little bit of grooming I spray some on the clippers and it seems to keep my dog satisfied until I can get finished and she doesn&#x27;t seem to matter as much. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Keeps the horses from feeling the heat of the blade, I think oils and cleans the blade.... Plus smells nice as well. SPend the couple extra bucks and cool your blades.</li>
    <li> Best stuff for cooling and lubing the clippers.  I trim our twos small dogs about every 4 to 5 weeks and it is a four hour session for the two.  I give them breaks when the trimmer gets warm and use the Cool care on the trimmer head.  Cools and lubes the metal workings pretty fast so I can continue with the job.</li>
    <li> Works well smells good and good price</li>
    <li> Item keeps dog clippers running smooth and cool.When blades begin to heat up just spray some on and it cools blades down. Super shipping!!</li>
    <li> This coolant really works on the clipper blades and is worth the money.  If you are thinking of buying something to help with the grooming process consider this as an addition to the blades.</li>
    <li> This product always works for me! I cut my hair once at least every two weeks and it really helps it from overheating and getting dry!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Andis Cool Care Plus. This was money well spent because it did exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> has to be used when cutting dog  hair ceramic blades can get hot and you wanta make sure you use the ceramic blades will cut ever so smooth</li>
    <li> A must use with the Andis Clippers.</li>
    <li> Use this every day at the shop, cleans and cools without issue. Could be a little cheaper but what can you do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again as I run out..</li>
    <li> This cool care really does work to cool down the clipper.  At first, I thought I didnt need it but I think it is actually a must to have around when it does it get.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. It will help cool and clean your clippers so you can finish that big job without a spare set of clippers.</li>
    <li> Used for cooling my poodle-clipper blade... reduces the heat quickly.  Also good for blowing the fine pieces of clipped hair out of the workings of the blade when finished.</li>
    <li> If you buy the Andis 22405 clippers, you will need this to cool the blades! Works quick. I also bought an extra set of blades to switch out after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. It smells good and easy to use when I finish this one I will sure get a few more.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> clipping your pets will be made better with clean clippers.  You can do it the old fashioned way with just clipper oil.  however clippers often become clogged with fine hairs.  This will clean the fine hairs out while at the same time cool the blades to make the animal less sensitive to the heat.  Good product.  Be sure to plan your purchase well so you get free shipping.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I read the reviews on this product. I&#x27;ve been grooming my 2 shih tzu&#x27;s and my sister&#x27;s 2 as well, and this makes it a lot easier to keep the blades cool, then having to switch out blades or wait for the blade to cool down. Great product.</li>
    <li> I like this product, although, if you want to cool your blades down super fast and already have the grease and oil for your clippers (which most likely come with the clippers) just use your computer duster air canister and flip it upside down so it sprays the liquid nitro it has in it, on the blades. Cools them down RIGHT away! Just remember to clean your clippers and spray them every hour with this spray if you don&#x27;t want to use the computer dust canister. I just end up using a little of all of it. Blade oil, spray, and nitro.</li>
    <li> It works exactly as advertised. The spray dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t drip. Don&#x27;t breath it in, it&#x27;ll give you cancer.</li>
    <li> great to clean, lube and keep blades cool, if you use a clipper then you should have this, i am sure that my dog appreciates it as well</li>
    <li> it really cools the blades down fast. the andis clippers I got heat up quick, so I had to use this constantly</li>
    <li> Great product for use with your clipper, helps clean and cool head !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use Oster&#x27;s Cool Lube for 30yrs and decided to try Andis&#x27;s version.  This lube works very well!  Definitely makes a distinct difference on the blades speed and effectively keeps them cool.  Also protects against various types of  virus, bacteria, and fungus.</li>
    <li> Works as it is supposed too. Slightly expensive.</li>
    <li> Really cooled down the blade of my clippers.  Has a pleasant scent as well.  I also like how it is an antimicrobial product, so it lubricates the blades while sanitizing them too!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Does exactly as advertised. Smoothed out my old razors and made them cut like new. Sorry I waited so long to get it.</li>
    <li> Never used this spray before and the clippers do get hot after a while.  It did help cool the clippers down and smells great.</li>
    <li> I used this product to lubricate and cool my blade.  It worked so well to lubricate but it did not keep the blade cool for very long.</li>
    <li> Must have product when cutting your own hair at home. Especially helpful to cool my clippers when cutting cutting my son&#x27;s hair and he complains &amp;#34;it&#x27;s too hot&amp;#34;... The spray works great to cool them off quickly and be able to keep on cutting.</li>
    <li> Good to use to keep clippers cool and working properly</li>
    <li> only used it one time</li>
    <li> Cleans and sterilizes the clippers that I use without the fear of acne/oil related transfer issues. I use this product to keep my cutter clean.</li>
    <li> Great product and shipped fast! i really like this better than the little oils i use to use! two sprays and your done</li>
    <li> Works well. Even with two clippers they tend to get warm when working steadily and this really helps</li>
    <li> Smells like barbershop. I love it!</li>
    <li> Really helps - Cutters get hot quick.</li>
    <li> Cools blades! I oddly enough like the smell</li>
    <li> This is a very nice and cool item.  Really cool as it say.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I was a groomer for five years and this is by far my favorite coolant for my clipper blades. I like that it does not just cool, but also lubricates. It is for sure one I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Good for your trimmer .</li>
    <li> Works good.  Better price than in the pet store.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Good product better than clippeecide i think it last longer than clippercide</li>
    <li> Seems to do what is is meant for. I am not a fan of how it smells, too heavy, too overpowering. I think it stinks but that&#x27;s just me. The packing was poor, the cap was shattered in the box. The can was fine and works.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will.  Cleans, disinfects, cools, and lubricates blades.</li>
    <li> Good for disinfecting and cooling down quickly. Not so great on the lubrication. My clippers actually sounds worse after I&#x27;ve sprayed the blade with this stuff, but it does work to cool the blade down significantly faster than simply laying my blade on tile or metal. Since I&#x27;m on a somewhat short budget, I can&#x27;t afford to be buying repeat blades for a while, and this helps to keep my blades going for a longer time. I&#x27;ll be sticking with this stuff for a while longer.</li>
    <li> I use it for all my shaving products.  To extend the life of my blades and keep my face/body hygiene healthy!</li>
    <li> This spray is great!  It works very well on lubricating clipper blades!  Thank you for a great product!  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> For all you men out there who shave, my husband ordered this and says it works very well for him.</li>
    <li> I bought this when I bought clippers to clip my Airedale and it works great to keep the blades clean.  Lasts a long time too but I don&#x27;t really like the smell so I only use it to clean the blades after I am finished with the clipping. Then I read another review that is has nasty chemicals in it.....</li>
    <li> Bought a Wahl 79300-1001 Home Pro kit to stop wasting money on basic haircuts. This spray has kept the blades running flawlessly with no wear and tear. Works exactly as described (which is pretty unheard of for any product). People are stating it has an odd odor. Personally, I think it smells good. Like a barber shop during clean up.</li>
    <li> Ease of use and price was right, this product helps keep my shaver, blade In great shape. If interested this should work well for you.</li>
    <li> These do what they&#x27;re supposed to. Take care of my blade and also cools the clippers down when needed, the scent is also nice.</li>
    <li> Received. I think I like the old Cool Lube better but this works.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use and it also santizes the blade which is good for all the dogs health</li>
    <li> Good! Does what I expect it to.</li>
    <li> Great product..  Blades are cleaned immediately and ready to use.  A time saver when cleaning blades for the next day.  Spray on both sides and let sit out overnight.</li>
    <li> Expensive but it does the job.  I showed my son the before/after with a UV light and won him over instantly. Sadly he took the can and the UV light and went to his place and did not have similar results to which I can only say different dog and most likely different carpet material. Still in my experience they all claim to do what only this one did for me, so if you want to start with a known winner and then go down hill from there, at least start here, it&#x27;s the one that worked and I tried all the pet store and hardware and big box store products and found them all lacking. There may be (obviously as my son found out) some combination that doesn&#x27;t work, but for me I use this because at least for me it delivered when many didn&#x27;t. I bought a high powered (LUMENS) LED UV so that my gaze into the fibers was well illuminated. I wish they&#x27;d cut the price, the only reason I rate 4 instead of 5, why not sell more charging less and make your profit in volume?</li>
    <li> Great price for the size.  This smells just like getting my hair cut at the salon.  The bottle was a lot bigger than I expected too.  It sprays on well, isn&#x27;t too oily and does a good job to cool down the blades.  I&#x27;m happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After having this for a while, I&#x27;m incredibly happy that I purchased it. I use this on 3 hour dog haircuts to keep my blades cool and quickly clean them out in between blades. I also use it on my electric shaver heads to keep the blades lubricated, sharp, and clean - which is actually more useful for that purpose than with my clippers that I got them for. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: After 2 years I&#x27;m still using the same bottle. Getting close to being finished though. I use this not only on my clippers but on my electric shaver as well.</li>
    <li> I use Andis clippers on my dogs.  After using this product the blades were hot after two minutes.</li>
    <li> Works very well!  Doesn&#x27;t cause hair to accumulate as clipper oil does.  I use it just before putting the clipper away so the clipper is ready for use next time.  There is noticeably less clipper noise - so my poodle is calmer during grooming.  The can is so large that it will last for years grooming one dog.  I don&#x27;t like the fragrance - so I walk outside to spray the clipper.  The odor evaporates in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> Keeps my clipper cool.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell at all.  Wish it had no smell at all.  It seems to work fine otherwise.  Not using it though.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by reviewing the shipping which with Amazon is always great. The product arrived very nicely packed with the actual product wrapped up nicely and tightly in a bag. I think they do this in case it leaks or something but I unwrapped it and no leaks just a pristine bottle. Now on to the product....  I have been cutting my hair for about 8 years now and never really thought about disinfecting my clippers, until I read some pretty nasty stories about people getting lice and other scalp conditions from barbers not disinfecting their clippers. So off I went to do some research and came upon this product. I never use my clippers on anyone else but myself so I never really worried about it. My usual clipper maintenance consisted of oiling and the occasional taking apart of the clippers and cleaning all parts down and re-oiling. But now that my son turned 1, I will be cutting his hair as well. So I&#x27;ve already used the product the first day it got here and I really like it. The smell is wonderful, some reviews said the smell was too strong but I disagree. The lubricating is also as good, if not better than regular clipper oil. So I still haven&#x27;t cut my sons hair yet but when I do I&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s nicely disinfected for his head.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest product. Works so well on cooling off my pet clippers. Wish I had found it years ago.</li>
    <li> We use this at work on our clippers, so I bought a can to use at home. Love it,  keeps clippers cool and lubed for longer duration use.</li>
    <li> Certainly a must have, if you own any kind of clippers. I use them with my andis and wahl. It makes it a lot easier to clean your clippers.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely necessary for any barber, amateur or professional. You have to keep your clippers clean, cool and well lubricated. This product does it all and leave a pleasing, clean scent on your clippers. Your clippers can get hot and when it does this cools them down. I highly recommend getting this product! It is a must have along with clipper oil. Love it!</li>
    <li> Helps cool the clippers great. we have two dogs so using this helps when we do both shaves on the same day to keep the clipper cool and lubricated.</li>
    <li> What a disappointment. Maybe it cools the blade but stinks so bad that it made we physicaly ill. Not only that but I cannot wash that smell of my blade that I sprayed. I used the blade with Andis trimmer on my dog not realizing that dog will not only smell but start to scrach like crazy. I groomed my dog with Andis trimmer and two blades before (without using Cool Care spray) but decided to use one blade and spray to cool it down with this product. What a mistake. I bathed my dog twice after the trim to wash of perfume smell, without much luck. The blade stinks after a few washes and I will not be able to use it again. What a waste of money for both Andis Cool Care and my new blade. I wish Andis mfg reached out and maybe replace my blade, i&#x27;m sure they can sell the ceramic blade to someone who loves perfumes.</li>
    <li> I use this product when using the Oster clippers for trimming my dog. the clippers get so hot that I am unable to cut him unless I spray them with cool care. This spray instantly cools down the clipper head and also lubricates the blades so that they cut nice. I have also used the Oster brand that compares to this product. I like the smell of the Oster but I get better results from Andis brand. overall, this is a good product to have and a must for clippers.</li>
    <li> Keeps blades clean and cool.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this one when I am grooming my dogs and it cools the clipper.</li>
    <li> Good machine lube. This is my favorite cleaner / lube</li>
    <li> Works great cooling the blades of my clippers.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says.</li>
    <li> You have to buy this if you have an Andis.  This stuff pretty much freezes your blades while cutting and directly after.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product for clipping your pet without burns or having to constantly stop &amp; wait for blades to cool.  With this spray I can trim both of my dogs without stopping.  Any time you feel the blades starting to heat up a quick spray cools them &amp; oils the blades.  Makes for a much more enjoyable experience for you and your animal.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job. No issues here.</li>
    <li> Works great for my clippers.....</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Sanitizes my clippers before and after I trim my manhood up.  Prevents rust and smells and feels great.  Lifetime user!!</li>
    <li> Use it on all my clippers and keeps them clean and sharp. Great product by andis.  Always recommend it to every barber</li>
    <li> Best for cleaning and lubricaitng my Andis clipper, works great! I would recommend it to anyone who comes across this great product.</li>
    <li> Performs as it should</li>
    <li> DOES THE JOB, KEEPS MY RAZORS AND CLIPS LIKE NEW</li>
    <li> excelent produts an service</li>
    <li> I use the Andis Cool Care Plus spray to cool down my detacheable cilpper blades.  This product also lubricates and desinfects your clipper blade.  This was an excellent buy.  I will buy this product again once I run out.</li>
    <li> This 5-in-1 coolant cools, lubricates, protects from rust, cleans, and disinfects clipper blades. I also spray my scissors with it. All in one can. I was able to save money purchasing it via amazon versus my grooming supply wholesale catalog. So I loaded up and bought 5 cans in one order.</li>
    <li> This will definitely keep your blades cool. I would recommend this to anyone grooming a pet that wants to keep from burning them.</li>
    <li> You ship fast, I like the product. Thanks</li>
    <li> This did exactly what it was advertised to do. Goes great with the Andis clippers. Love that it Lubs too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 2X and it seems to help keep the clippers cool.  Transparent and not greasy to the touch.</li>
    <li> This worked really great for my dog clippers.  I have 6 malti-poo&#x27;s and I needed this a long time ago.  It cleans, oils, sanitizes and all the good stuff that your clippers need in one nice spray.  I cut 3 of my dogs hair over the weekend and my clippers stayed cool unlike before I would have to stop for a long time to let the blade cool so it didn&#x27;t hurt my doggies sensitive skin.  The smell I remember from taking my boys to the barber shop to get their hair cut.  I always knew what that smell was and now I do.  Brings back pleasant memories along with doing a great job on my clippers.</li>
    <li> I have used other products that did not work as well or as easily as this does. this is the all in one you need.</li>
    <li> This spray is cheap and amazing would recommend to everone who cuts hair. Also cheaper then in store price. 5/5</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned my clippers now for about 24 years and several components have been replaced due to wear and tear. The blades have been my biggest problem due to sanitary and reliability issues, taking these blades apart after every use to clean and maintain their sharpness has always been my biggest hurdle until I discovered Andis Cool Care Plus. Now during and after each use my clippers stay lubricated , sanitized and run cooler than they ever have before and the best part is the sharpness of the blade has been extended</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product.  Previously I have only used an oil. Great suggestion for add-on purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff does the job, but I suggest you do it ina ventilated area otherwise you will gas yourself.....This is what my barber uses, and all other barbers i know because its the best to kill germs and diseases...but for personal use what I got it for, its really not needed I don&#x27;t think...As long as you oil your clippers with Andis Oil every so often and clean your blades your good......However if you are a barber and need this for professional use, this is the BEST that you can buy I think....</li>
    <li> Must have when grooming your own dog.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this cool care along with the Andis clipper, especially if you plan on using the clippers for an extended length of time! Just spray on..wait 20-30 seconds then continue clipping!</li>
    <li> Works great for cooling the hair clippers blade instantly!</li>
    <li> just like my barber has</li>
    <li> Spary I think helps to cool blades as well as protect,clean and prevent rust and lubricate. Well worth buying and smells nice!</li>
    <li> Good product for a good price, saved my trimmer from its chronic jamming problem. Smells pretty good too.</li>
    <li> I got this when I got my Andis Pet clippers. Glad I did!  It works great when you are doing a small  to medium dog and will speed up the cool down time when doing a larger dog. Also helped keep the blades cleansed out. I actually got a discount at Cajunmarket.info for getting the two together.</li>
    <li> After years of worrying about and working around hot clipper blades, I finally had sense enough to try the Andis Cool Care Plus when I ordered the Andis Dog Clipper and assorted blades.  It does make a difference and also aids in cleaning the blades.  It is a large can and I will replace this product before I run out completely.  It was packaged very well (no leaks or mess) and arrived within the promised delivery time.</li>
    <li> I choose 5 stars because it does what its design to do!!! That is cool, clean, oil clippers. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Spray is a little runny but works okay, little more than like to pay but should last a while. Received quickly.</li>
    <li> We bought this product to go with the Andis pet clipper and it does  it&#x27;s job as it states, thanks</li>
    <li> Works well to keep your clippers from overheating</li>
    <li> i dont really have much to say about this product other then it works and is does what its supposed to</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a DIY hair cutter  I&#x27;m so glad I got this I heard of this when I see to go to the barber shop and get my hair done it cleans the buzzer and I feel tht it gives you a nice clean close cut</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. No problems. Helps us get through a long clipping without having to take too many breaks.</li>
    <li> I trim my husbands hair and our mini poodle and this spray works great for both. I trim my husbands hair with the dogs clippers as they work better then the human ones. I have done 7 full hair cuts between both and this spray still as a ton let  so it lasts a while.The smell isn&#x27;t to bad, it is not super in my opinion but it works very well for cooling so smell is not that important. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I could not have asked for a better performing clipper disinfectant and cooling spray! I will buy again whenever this bottle runs out!</li>
    <li> Product received in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to try to clean and oil the clippers after every use separately, just use this, all in one, disinfects, oils and smells good.</li>
    <li> This product is a must for barbers everywhere.  Whether you are a professional or DIYer like me, this product provides welcomed relief to stubborn hair clippers that frequently overheat.  It also lubricates the blades and acts as an antiseptic.  Be that as it may, this product should not act as a stand alone lubricant; for lubrication you should always apply a clipper oil of some sort (Andis makes this as well - surprise! surprise!) after each use.  This will keep the blades running smoother longer.</li>
