### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This Kajal is really great..</li>
      <li>Very nice product.</li>
      <li>Product was delivered within time and in good condition.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never used it before but assumed it would be good based on the ingredients.</li>
      <li>The person I gifted this to just loved the product and they are using it everyday,so it is a good product.</li>
      <li>This is a nice eye liner.  </li>
      <li>It creates a nice look for my eyes.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice smooth eyeliner with rich color.</li>
      <li>I hope they will pay more attention to how they ship their products.  </li>
      <li>5 stars as I&#x27;ve been using this product for 7 years and glad that someone is selling it on Amazon as I can not find it in any US stores.</li>
      <li>Sometimes needs some smudging afterward to even it out, and it always stays put better when I apply powder to the area before or after with a foundation brush.</li>
      <li>I love this kajal.</li>
      <li>I am very light and have light reddish hair.</li>
      <li>so it is not so easy to smear to where it shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This is easy on the skin and can go with any coloring.</li>
      <li>It smears quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>Surely recommended for anyone who is interested in product or seller.</li>
      <li>I was very happy to find it here, for a while it was hard to find.</li>
      <li>Regardless of the fact that Depp uses it (among many other celebs), I was also impressed by the Founder&#x27;s bio on her website and she was actually featured in some magazines.  </li>
      <li>It is perfect for use on the upper lid, but it does smudge if you apply it on the inner part of the eye.</li>
      <li>I took a while to get but the product is worth it.</li>
      <li>I was a little concerned about any possible eye allergies or watering, but this product is perfect!!</li>
      <li>and the product is also a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>This kajal liner has a great moist texture and deep dark color that I was looking for, and while very smudgy I was happy with it and was wearing it for several days in a row, around the  lash line of my upper lid and waterline of lower lid.     </li>
      <li>I love how rich and cooling the kajal is - that said can be a little daunting to apply &amp; some melting off</li>
      <li>Lasts all day and is nice and dark.  </li>
      <li>I really like how it makes my eyes look.  </li>
      <li>The reviews seemed to indicate this was a real kohl eyeliner</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just too intense and smudges during the day.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing to my eyes, and I wear contacts.</li>
      <li>Based on this information I was excited about Biotique as I wanted ONLY an ORGANIC non-Mercury Kajal and ordered it ASAP.  </li>
      <li>If I do touch my lids then I have to make sure I do not have black where it shouldn&#x27;t be.  </li>
      <li>My main concern is not with the product itself as I did hours of research on Kajal eyeliner that has NO Mercury in it.  </li>
      <li>This is the 1st time I have used Kkajal so it is a new experience to me.  </li>
      <li>It works as good as on me as it does on a friend who is very dark and has black hair.</li>
      <li>To my GREAT disappointment-</li>
      <li>I like the product and bought it because of its natural ayurverdic ingredients.</li>
      <li>I also like that it is an all natural, organic product.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend it to those who want to use natural make up</li>
      <li>This product is a natural make up.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for something that I could use for a more subtle effect.</li>
      <li>Many Kajals also have a cooling menthol effect this one does not.. (good because that cooling effect makes my eyes water and itch)</li>
      <li>Its dark.. applies smoothly and stay on for long without smudging.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick like a crayon, but smooth as butter.</li>

<li> I know it&#x27;s not going to cause any health concerns down the road.</li>

<li> I am just not a fan - it goes on very dark (pitch black), very thick, and does not come off!  </li>
<li> Disappointed in this kajal because it just goes on in such a thick line and there is no way in putting it on in a slightly lighter line,  </li>
<li> They lost me as a customer due to this unfortunate incident.</li>
<li> Not good.</li>
<li> However, I am so use to the eyeliner drying and not being afraid to touch my lid during the day.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Disappointed in this kajal because it just goes on in such a thick line and there is no way in putting it on in a slightly lighter line,  It&#x27;s just too intense and smudges during the day.  End up with panda eyeds.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. The reviews seemed to indicate this was a real kohl eyeliner but it is just like any other creme eyeliner you can buy in the drug store. It smears quickly and easily. Not the look anyone is going for!</li>
    <li> My main concern is not with the product itself as I did hours of research on Kajal eyeliner that has NO Mercury in it.  Biotique had several articles that stated that even actors like Johnny Depp use it and the Founder was raised (I think) on her grandpa&#x27;s tea plantation in India so that is how she learned about the value of organic  products and Ayurveda. Regardless of the fact that Depp uses it (among many other celebs), I was also impressed by the Founder&#x27;s bio on her website and she was actually featured in some magazines.  Based on this information I was excited about Biotique as I wanted ONLY an ORGANIC non-Mercury Kajal and ordered it ASAP.  ***To my GREAT disappointment- I got the \\&quot;Biotique Eye Cream Almond\\&quot; product  instead of the \\&quot;Biotique Kajal Eyeliner\\&quot; and returned it promptly.  It is as if the person just dumped anything that said the word \\&quot;eye\\&quot; on the Biotique product and in the future I hope they will pay more attention to how they ship their products.  They lost me as a customer due to this unfortunate incident.</li>
    <li> I am just not a fan - it goes on very dark (pitch black), very thick, and does not come off!  Perhaps that is what you are looking for.  I was hoping for something that I could use for a more subtle effect.</li>
    <li> This kajal liner has a great moist texture and deep dark color that I was looking for, and while very smudgy I was happy with it and was wearing it for several days in a row, around the  lash line of my upper lid and waterline of lower lid.     My lashes/eyelids were starting to feel itchy, then sore, finally I gave in and rubbed my eyes and washed the kajal off. The areas where the product had been were red and raw! The skin was actually coming off in places! I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allergic to something in the kajal or what, but I do not recommend anyone else testing that theory out.</li>
    <li> I love this kajal. I was skeptical after reading all the reviews about it smearing easily. I have had no problems with it smearing. I apply it early in the morning, smudge it a little with an eyeliner smudger to set it, and it&#x27;s there all day. It does sort of tingle on my water line, but it&#x27;s not bothersome to me. It has a bold look with a thick line, so if you aren&#x27;t going for dramatic, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> This product is a natural make up.  I like that and the product is also a very reasonable price.  I would recommend it to those who want to use natural make up</li>
    <li> This Kajal is really great.. Its dark.. applies smoothly and stay on for long without smudging. Many Kajals also have a cooling menthol effect this one does not.. (good because that cooling effect makes my eyes water and itch)</li>
    <li> This is the 1st time I have used Kkajal so it is a new experience to me.  I find that it last a long time &amp; doesn&#x27;t smudge at all.  I really like how it makes my eyes look.  I also like that it is an all natural, organic product.  I know it&#x27;s not going to cause any health concerns down the road.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  I&#x27;ve used kohl and kajal before - some from India and Turkey.  This one - not so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After putting the product in your eye and around, less than 10 minutes later it seemed to run down my face.  Not good.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  However, I am so use to the eyeliner drying and not being afraid to touch my lid during the day.  If I do touch my lids then I have to make sure I do not have black where it shouldn&#x27;t be.  I believe that with use, I will use my finger to smudge it so it is not so easy to smear to where it shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I like the product and bought it because of its natural ayurverdic ingredients. It is perfect for use on the upper lid, but it does smudge if you apply it on the inner part of the eye.</li>
    <li> 5 stars as I&#x27;ve been using this product for 7 years and glad that someone is selling it on Amazon as I can not find it in any US stores. Product was delivered within time and in good condition. Surely recommended for anyone who is interested in product or seller. Cons: Shipping cost can be less.</li>
    <li> I love how rich and cooling the kajal is - that said can be a little daunting to apply &amp; some melting off</li>
    <li> Less smudgy than other Kajals. Sometimes needs some smudging afterward to even it out, and it always stays put better when I apply powder to the area before or after with a foundation brush. Lasts all day and is nice and dark.  Very soothing to my eyes, and I wear contacts.</li>
    <li> This is a nice eye liner.  It doesn&#x27;t smear like others I&#x27;ve tried.  It creates a nice look for my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is easy on the skin and can go with any coloring. I am very light and have light reddish hair. It works as good as on me as it does on a friend who is very dark and has black hair. It is all in how you apply it.  This friend gave me one of these as a gift about 8 years ago and it is the only one I ever use since then. I was very happy to find it here, for a while it was hard to find.</li>
    <li> I took a while to get but the product is worth it. I&#x27;ve never used it before but assumed it would be good based on the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Just as described. This is a very nice smooth eyeliner with rich color. It&#x27;s thick like a crayon, but smooth as butter.</li>
    <li> The person I gifted this to just loved the product and they are using it everyday,so it is a good product. I was a little concerned about any possible eye allergies or watering, but this product is perfect!!</li>
