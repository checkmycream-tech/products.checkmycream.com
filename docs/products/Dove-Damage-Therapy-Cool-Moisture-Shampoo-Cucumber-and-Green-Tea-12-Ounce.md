      <li>This shampoo smells amazing and it shipped so quickly!</li>
      <li>Love DOVE</li>
      <li>I love it on subscription because it&#x27;s one of those things that you forget to buy at the store all the time.  </li>
      <li>the niece will love it since its her &#x27;scent&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Wonderful smell and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair so clean, shiny and takes out the OIL!  </li>
      <li>It smells good and does exactly what you expect shampoo to do... clean your hair.  </li>
      <li>Always seems to leave my hair clean and residue free.</li>
      <li>so I basically have to order another set of products worth $25 to buy this shampoo!</li>
      <li>I doesn&#x27;t damage hairs and has a fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>I thought it would have more of a cooling effect on my head, like head and shoulders similar product.</li>
      <li>Okay shampoo, I will stick to my matrix and will continue looking for a supplemental shampoo to alternate days with.</li>
      <li>Should have looked more closely at the fluid ounces in this bottle.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is gentle and good for everyday use.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product my hair was extremely dry and after using this a coupe of times my hair started to feel softer and it defiantly added the moisture back into it I would recommend it to anyone with dry hair or if you are just wanting to give your hair a boost of moisture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now with a dove conditioner and my hair feels and looks so much healthier.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement.</li>
      <li>my hair feel so soft and shiny and pretty.</li>
      <li>We switched over to Dove again once it was clear that our shampoo was causing my SO allergy problems.</li>
      <li>I have thin, fine hair that&#x27;s easily damaged and after using this once my hair was softer and less frizzy.</li>

    <li> Wonderful product my hair was extremely dry and after using this a coupe of times my hair started to feel softer and it defiantly added the moisture back into it I would recommend it to anyone with dry hair or if you are just wanting to give your hair a boost of moisture.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products out there!  Dove makes awesome products, and I LOVE this one and the scent!  Makes my hair so clean, shiny and takes out the OIL!  It rocks!  Great price, too!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it. When my package arrived, the shampoo was open and it was all over the rest of my order. It was a mess!</li>
    <li> It smells good and does exactly what you expect shampoo to do... clean your hair.  It does not knock my socks off....  but then again in the shower I am not wearing socks...</li>
    <li> Horrible packaging! The entire product spilled inside the box and there was practically no shampoo left in the bottle! Moreover it&#x27;s an add-on item and they will not send another one in exchange for this, so I basically have to order another set of products worth $25 to buy this shampoo! I am majorly disappointed!</li>
    <li> Dove is the best! Always seems to leave my hair clean and residue free. Never had a Dove hair care product that I Didn&#x27;t like. They are just consistently good!</li>
    <li> I received item on time it is just like any store bought shampoo. I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement. It didn&#x27;t make my hair&lt;br /&gt;worse just acted like store shampoo</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo!  Wonderful smell and leaves my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing and it shipped so quickly!</li>
    <li> Should have looked more closely at the fluid ounces in this bottle. I thought it would have more of a cooling effect on my head, like head and shoulders similar product. Using the word &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; in their marketing of this product is misleading.  Okay shampoo, I will stick to my matrix and will continue looking for a supplemental shampoo to alternate days with.</li>
    <li> This shampoo did nothing but dry out my hair and left a really hard to wash of feeling on my skin. I would not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> great  ! good for every day use.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair that&#x27;s easily damaged and after using this once my hair was softer and less frizzy. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now with a dove conditioner and my hair feels and looks so much healthier. I get it through Amazon subscribe and save so the price is really good too.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I have found.</li>
    <li> We switched over to Dove again once it was clear that our shampoo was causing my SO allergy problems. We got this, and POOF, allergies gone.  I love it on subscription because it&#x27;s one of those things that you forget to buy at the store all the time.  Now I have one when I need it.</li>
    <li> Love DOVE NOW!Makes my hair feel so soft and shiny and pretty.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is gentle and good for everyday use. I doesn&#x27;t damage hairs and has a fresh smelling.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, love dove products.</li>
