<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i discovered proraso about a year ago and am addicted to there products. their cost to value in my opinion is outstanding. this is a lighter aftershave lotion that smells great and wont leave you with that greasy lotion feel heavier creams can have</li>
    <li> Use in conjunction with shaving cream.  Goes on smooth and does not leave behind a film. Very soothing and comforting.</li>
    <li> They changed their formula. The old stuff rocks, this stuff does not.</li>
    <li> I like the product and would recommend it. Smell is pleasant and is refreshing. I also have the preshave and they pair well together.</li>
    <li> Bottle is way too small.. you will need a decent amount of lotion to cover your face.  Face will still feel tight if you dont put enough on, so the bottle wont last you very long.  honestly i prefer the cheap alchohol based \\&quot;SkinBracer\\&quot; aftershave over the Proraso.. funny since I have very sensitive skin..</li>
    <li> Awesome after shave, doesn&#x27;t sting but there is a cooling effect. I love that the scent is not heavy and you could easily use cologne if you so choose. It does the job, and it does it well.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells incredible and soothes the burn and leaves the skin ultra smooth after shaving. My only complaint is the high price.</li>
    <li> As advertised...not greasy wont clog the pores and soothes and moisturizes the skin. Proraso makes high quality products at a good price</li>
    <li> Io uso solo questo prodotto cos&amp;igrave; im molto felice che &amp;egrave; disponibile online. ma il prezzo &amp;egrave; un po &#x27;alta. Devo dare il cibo per tre settimane. ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this aftershave wanting something that didn&#x27;t sting, and smelled nice.  That&#x27;s exactly what I got.  It works like it&#x27;s supposed to.  I have read where some people say it made them break out (?), but then again - I&#x27;m an italian using an italian product, so maybe it&#x27;s better suited for me.  I love it and now only use Proraso products (shave soap as well).  Viva Italia!</li>
    <li> Good quality after shave for those with sensitive skin. It is not greasy and it&#x27;s absorbed quickly. It soothes and I like the nice clean scent as opposed to the cheap macho scents you get with cheaper after shaves.    Sure it&#x27;s expensive, but it works.</li>
    <li> Ordered this from reviews and member comments on a shaving forum. Makes you face feel moist and smells great. Recommend this to anyone who shaves. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I hate to rate a product low, but I&#x27;m just not so sure that this helped at all. Maybe a little bit but I didn&#x27;t experience a night and day difference. Maybe because I didn&#x27;t use it every day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back in time, I&#x27;d buy this product again, because there are many people on amazon who have rated it 5 stars. Just maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to a comment, I am adding the following update to share a little more information on my feelings after 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have it, and use it from time to time. I don&#x27;t see or feel any noticeable difference from using it, but I also don&#x27;t see any noticeable differences from taking a multi-vitamin every day either. So there is a chance that there is some value add here that I just am not seeing which is why I use it from time to time. Just not for every shave.</li>
    <li> After upgrading my shaving cream to Proraso, I figured it was time I updated my aftershave too. I was using a Nivea sensitive aftershave, so this was quite the upgrade! This one smells better, absorbs quicker, and works better too. One thin layer is all I need, which is nice when I had to use two for Nivea. The only downside is that this is a lot more expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Started using Proraso products since visiting Italy all their products are used by the majority of barbers in Italy.Prorasos line of shaving supplies are the best in the world as far as quality goes.You get what you pay for.Everytime I shave the Proraso balm or aftershave smell remind me of mornings in Tuscany.</li>
    <li> Of all my purchases of shaving products through Amazon.com, the Proraso after shave balm was one of the best.  I have very sensitive skin and use a Mekur adjustable razor (futur) so I get a very close shave and need this product to clear the redness and razor burn.  It really works well and I would recommend it for anyone but especially for those with sensitive skin.  It tightens your skin and makes it look healthy. The product has no alcohol.</li>
    <li> I use this after every shave and it soothes and moisturizes the skin perfectly.  Just a dime sized dab is all you need, so it will last a good while.  I love the mild clean fragrance of this after shave, leaves your face in good shape after a shave.  I will definetly use this from now on.</li>
    <li> Please beware Proraso lovers:  This scent is radically different from the wonderful Proraso shave cream.  I have been using Proraso shaving cream in the green tube for six years now, and decided to try this product to match.  The scent was noxious to me, even borderline foul.      The product does make your skin feel wonderful, but it is thin and watery to me.  I had to rate it low for the scent alone.  Also note that everyone&#x27;s olfactory senses are entirely different, so to you, this may be a delightful scent.  Just don&#x27;t think that it is in any way the same smell as the Proraso shave cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this aftershave balm after doing a bit of research, and I am very pleased.  This balm seems to do a very good job of keeping the skin on my face moisturized for a longer period of time than most aftershave balms that I have used.  This aftershave balm is relatively thick (compared to some of the others I have used like Nivea, Adidas, Old Spice, and some other miscellaneous P&amp;G products).  The other balms that I have used were good, but I think this Proraso is a cut above the rest.  You definitely pay for that premium, but if you don&#x27;t want your skin to start showing signs of flaky dryness after 4-6 hours, this Proraso balm is your best bet.    As with any Proraso product, I feel like I use less of it per \\&quot;use\\&quot; than comparable products.  100ml of this balm is probably more like 133ml of another brand&#x27;s aftershave balm.    The smell is very calm and soothing.  This won&#x27;t overpower a cologne (which I think is nice), but then again, I rarely wear cologne.  I will probably stick with this for now because it is my favorite aftershave balm to date.</li>
    <li> Since we have recently converted to wet shaving, we were fortunate to receiving the good advice to use Proraso products. This is an excellent product and does the job that you expect from an alcohol free balm.</li>
    <li> Nice, clean and mild scent. Not quite as comforting as Pre de Provence which is my daily ASB, but definitely good stuff and worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is my second consecutive with this Proraso product and I have no desire to change anytime soon.  The feel after a shave is soothing and cooling without having a menthol burning.  The smell is so very clean and crisp.  I would recommend this without hesitation to anyone looking at purchasing.</li>
    <li> Imagine solid bars of sexy being melted down, bottled and sold as aftershave.  Imagine no more.  Based on solid reviews and wanting to try REAL shaving (double-edged razor, shaving soap and courage), I hoped this would round out the experience, if not soften the rookie cuts.  I soon learned that \\&quot;real\\&quot; shaving takes time, patience and practice and I&#x27;m too busy fending off babes to ditch my Mach Turbo no-brainer, even if it&#x27;s the reason behind my ingrown hairs.  1)  This stuff smells legitimately good.  I typically avoid scented products because they&#x27;re too \\&quot;perfumy,\\&quot; for lack of a better term.  The scent  has a sublte, quality element that will never be mistaken for your girlfriend&#x27;s conditioner.  2)  Excellent texture, non-greasy and absorbs beautifully.    3)  My skin stays clear; every product in the universe (I&#x27;m an expert) seems to claim \\&quot;won&#x27;t clog pores,\\&quot; but we know better.  Gentlemen, it&#x27;s worth the money.  A little goes a long ways and you&#x27;ll be happy you tried it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. Even if I had to pay full retail next time, I would still buy it again. This is the best shaving lotion for straight razor or DE razor shaving.</li>
    <li> This aftershave is amazing. It&#x27;s incredibly moisturizing, feels great and keeps my neck from having razor burn. This aftershave works better than for me [[ASIN:B000EO67N6 CLINIQUE by Clinique Skin Supplies For Men:Post Shave Soother Beard Control Formula--/2.5OZ]] for cheaper. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> I have recently been trying out several shaving products and am impressed with many of the Proraso products I have purchased so far. This after shave feels good on the face and smells nice. It is soothing and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> This product is a great follow up after a close shave with a Vision or Futur double edge razor. It is very soothing but does not contain alcohol.</li>
    <li> Here was my experience with this stuff. I shaved with Proraso shave soap and I got an extremely rich lather. I also, shaved with a top of the line electric razor from panasonic. But, it got too close to my face and started ripping off skin, no irritations though, Proraso is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally with alcohol after shave, my skin is hurting from the string and irritated for days. It starts getting irritated after day one. But, I put some of this Proraso Liquid Cream after shave on and it&#x27;s magic. It minimized my razor bumps and irritations and my face felt incredibly smooth and comfortable. This stuff is magic in the fact that it soothes your face and keeps it from getting irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Because it is alcohol free! It contains Witch Hazel, Vitamin E, and other natural elements for those with a sensitive face that gets easily irritated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an after-shave that has done anything to soothe razor burn before I started using Proraso. This stuff is amazing, put it on and the burn and redness go away.    It&#x27;s expensive, for such a small bottle, but a little bit goes a long way. Put it on when your face is still wet and a small drop will cover your whole face.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the old formula.</li>
    <li> Wow, where to start? From a positive standpoint, this lotion smells great and applies easily, evenly, and it isn&#x27;t sticky. The problems lie in that it doesn&#x27;t do much as an aftershave at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this stuff is very greasy, and it made me break out like crazy. I couldn&#x27;t believe how many pimples I would get by mid afternoon when I would use this; I was in disbelief in light of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the glass container it comes in has seriously gotta go. There is no reason why in 2012 we should be bothering to extract a thick lotion like this from a glass bottle, no reason at all. I don&#x27;t care how old-fashioned you liked to think you are, there&#x27;s a point at which outmoded ideas become impractical, and this is a perfect example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, although it&#x27;s a fairly potent lotion, it doesn&#x27;t stick around long enough to moisturize throughout the day. In a nutshell, this product fails at all of the most important aspects of an aftershave balm. It&#x27;s too bad, because although I&#x27;ve finally found an adequate replacement that does everything right that Proraso gets wrong, this stuff STILL has the best fragrance I&#x27;ve used. I hate colognes and aftershaves with strong, overbearing fragrances, and the mild but pleasant scent of this balm is more or less perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Creamy citrus scent when first applied which slowly fades. Scent is clean and masculine. Moisturizes skin and calms irritation. Makes your face soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin.  This is the best aftershave balm I have ever used.  Better than Nivea and Gillette.  Absorbs quickly and has a nice lite barbarshop scent. But it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any cologne I might decide to wear.</li>
    <li> This is actually my second time ordering Proraso Liquid Cream After-Shave Balm through Amazon.  The other order may have been a gift from my brother, but I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how amazing this stuff is.  I&#x27;m always putting all kinds of different lotions on my face due to the fact that I tan almost every day except for about 2 months this year after getting a pretty sizable tattoo, and not wanting it to fade.  I now use a rub-on SPF-50 sunscreen stick on the tattoo while tanning, and I&#x27;m back to a healthy natural-looking glow that seems to please the ladies.  The problem is that I use a facial tanning lotion, after-shave balms, Ponds Skin Cream to keep my face moisturized (because if I use regular after-sun lotion I WILL BREAK OUT LIKE A TEENAGER.)  I&#x27;ve also started using a Panasonic electric shaver this year, (the 8249s.)  Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever use, and I&#x27;ve used a few expensive ones, but I still have to touch up around my sideburns and my adam&#x27;s apple with a regular razor.  I&#x27;m just one of those guys who has horribly stiff facial hair, and to top it off, I have a predisposition to facial infections from using the same razor more than once (especially because I tend to shave in a hurry and get several nicks.)  This after-shave balm has changed all that.  I can shave with my Panasonic Arc Foil, touch up with a Schick Xtreme 3, wash with a facial scrub, and then use this balm, and I end up just having a smooth, clean face that my wife loves. It doesn&#x27;t have any overpowering scent, so it will go with whatever cologne I happen to be wearing at any given time, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to react with any facial tanning lotions I use, (so I don&#x27;t break out if I happen to shave just before going to tan.)  It beats any after shave I can get locally; the closest I&#x27;ve ever purchased was actually a gift from Bath and Body Works which is no longer available, and after doing a little research before my first purchase of this lotion, I found out that either Proraso manufactured that lotion for Bath and Body Works or pretty much everyone that used that after-shave has switched over to Proraso Liquid Cream; I can&#x27;t really tell which.  Either way, if you&#x27;re looking for an effective after-shave that is amazing and lasts a long time (I only have to use a dime-sized portion to cover from below my adam&#x27;s apple almost up to my eyes, so 1 bottle lasts me 3-4 months;) then look no further.  I&#x27;m more than willing to pay $16-17 a bottle for this stuff.  My only regret is that I have to wait for shipping, and that its not available at any local retailers.  I solve that issue by purchasing a new bottle when I get to about 1/3 of the bottle remaining, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another after-shave again (unless I&#x27;m traveling, and I&#x27;ve just happened to be fool enough to leave my after-shave at home &#x3D;p!)</li>
    <li> Typically like Proraso, but this stuff was probably my least favorite.  Perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want a little bit of sting or anyone experiencing extremely dry skin after shaving.  Lightly scented in comparison to their other lines.</li>
    <li> This goes on lightly, isn&#x27;t greasy, and has a very masculine smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. The scent (citrus-y) lasts a while.</li>
    <li> The product is good for after shave.</li>
    <li> Proaso after is a really good aftershave. It dries quickly, no alcohol to dry out the skin. I would have liked a little more of a stronger scent. But overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> I use it every time I shave and it really softens the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a permanent part of my shaving prep. Nothing but superlatives.</li>
    <li> I used Nivea for sensitive skin before I switched to Truefitt and Hill ultimate comfort. truefitt ultimate comfort has been the best aftershave for sensitive skin with no questions. But for warmer days when I need a lighter, but soothing aftershave I use Proraso. Proraso is less dense so I need a couple of coats. The scent is very light and not overpowering. I think this is a good aftershave one step up from Nivea.</li>
    <li> Proraso after-shave cream has been working wonders on my face.  I used to struggle with skin sensitivities and in-grown white hairs fairly often, but not since I started using this a month ago in combination with Proraso&#x27;s shave cream.  My neck/beard area feels smooth and no longer looks red or dried out.  I wish I had known about this years ago.  My only gripes are the bottle comes in only one size (ie no travel friendly option, breakable glass) and the ingredients seem overly complex chemically (vs. their shaving cream).  I recommend trying this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> All jokes aside on the review title this product is great. It has a very light smell which I actually barely could smell in the bottle. Once I got to use the product a few times it was obvious it had a refreshing scent that faded as it dried. This liquid cream goes on extremely easy and dries leaving your skin feeling nice and smooth.. (or as smooth as you shaved it that is)</li>
    <li> I am in my second bottle, and love it.  The lotion is gentle on your skin after you shave.  The smell is very smooth, soft, and clean, while not overwhelming.  The lotion is not greasy.  I actually leave some water on my face when I rinse after shaving and add the lotion to better moist the skin.  I am sure others vary on how they use the lotion.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I find this after shave good...  I have been using a similar Giorgio Armani cream and I dont see much difference in quality except for some nit-picky differences in smell.</li>
    <li> theirs better and cheaper alternatives.  This aftershave feels very good on the face.  It&#x27;s very soothing, especially to new DE shaver&#x27;s like me.  However, I&#x27;ve learned that at-least for my face, the Nivea aftershave for sensitive skin works just as good, if not better, and only costs 1/3 as much.  Also, I can pick the Nivea up at the local Walmart, and don&#x27;t have to pay additional shipping costs for the Proraso aftershave.</li>
    <li> Best shaving accessories ever</li>
    <li> Best smelling aftershave lotion in the market. I only have to use a small amount each time and it leaves my skin moisturized and silky smooth for the entire day.</li>
    <li> Product contains an added \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; yet its labeled as \\&quot;sensitive free\\&quot;. Dermatologists must be scratching their heads because those two quotes should never be printed on the same bottle. Any kind of fragrance increases the potential to irritate sensitive skin. Fragrance is used by companies for the sole purpose of selling their products based on how nice it smells. A products scent has NO correlation with its effectiveness. It&#x27;s kind of scary how many positive reviews on here are based primarily on scent. Point being, this is a very basic and overpriced after shave cream which might not irritate that skin of most people but should not be marketed as \\&quot;sensitive free\\&quot;. If you have sensitive skin go to your local drug store and you&#x27;ll be able to find real sensitive skin products for at least half the price. Keep in mind that the first ingredient on a products label makes up the majority of what&#x27;s in it. The first ingredient on this $16.00+ Proraso liquid cream 3.4 fl oz after-shave is WATER...LOL...enough said</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  Use this with their menthol shaving cream and menthol pre-shave cream and a DE razor with Feather blades and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
    <li> The bottle is extremely poorly constructed, to the point that the bottle cap doesn&#x27;t screw on properly to the bottle.  As a result, cream gets everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it has a rather faint smell that is not particularly pleasant.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and I get razor burns and ingrown hairs very easily. I can&#x27;t stand alcohol-based skin products so I was really happy to discover this after-shave. It feels extremely smooth, smells nice and provides a nice moisturizing feeling. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Smooth ,smooth   we do a lot of shaving &amp; this product works best with the rest of Proraso products .Not pricey at all Unlike the product I was getting at the Art of Shaving  Most reasonable &amp; delightful to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great aftershave, but I kind of miss the zing I would get from the alcoholic after-shaves. I used Aqua Velva before this product, and I found that it would just dry out my skin way too much. So I tried to get a non-alcohol based lubricant in Proraso, but I still get razor bumps. While I feel this product is great in keeping my skin smooth and soft, I would opt for Proraso&#x27;s other after-shave instead because it keeps my skin soft and it eliminates any razor bumps. [[ASIN:B001N9MJX8 Proraso Dioibarba Aftershave Lotion 100ml/3.4oz]]</li>
    <li> I have never been a big fan of using aftershave.  I&#x27;ve switched to this after years of struggling with skin irritation from shaving with Gilette products.  I now use a safety razor and the Proraso shaving soap and this after shave cream.  No more issues with skin irritation.  I&#x27;m shaving more often now with the safety razor and have fewer problems with skin irriation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This after shave cream does a great job of soothing my skin. It does not burn and the scent is very pleasant.  It isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.  One of the main reasons I avoided aftershave for so many years--the burn and the smell--isn&#x27;t a problem with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, feels great, dries quickly and smells good! Really and truly eliminates any razor burn whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I threw out all my other after-shaves! Proraso Liquid Cream Aftershave is all I use, now! It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, that was my number one reason for trying this product, that and my experience with Proraso&#x27;s other products. I wish it were available in a larger bottle, or if Sam&#x27;s club had it in bulk packaging, but of course, they never heard of it! (Not made in China!)</li>
    <li> This is really quality stuff for your face after a shave - the smell is very nice - not over powering.  It leaves your face feeling fresh and is very light not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very elegant too.  Nicely shaped so it fits in the med cabinet without taking up too much room.</li>
    <li> This after shave serves to put a finishing touch on a close, comfortable shave.  I provides a soothing touch with a fresh, pleasant smell.  I give it my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> Started using immediately when I received it. Works wonderfully, cools and soothes. I use all Proraso shave creams and lotions now... highly recommended to anyone using a straight or safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other aftershaves with my safety razor... this one seems to sooth the best of anything I have tried.</li>
    <li> First solution to my burning problems was to start using this shaving cream: http://www.amazon.com/Proraso-Shaving-Soap-Ultra-Sensitive/dp/B001JHEY14/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_26  I added witches hazel post cold rinse, pre-after shave cream.  All in all I like this stuff.</li>
    <li> This liquid-cream aftershave will sooth your skin whenever you get a razor burn. A few minutes after application nearly all of the fragrance is gone, and your skin feels much better. Doesn&#x27;t clash with other aftershave lotions, or colognes.</li>
    <li> I used this product last night for the first time after a good traditional wet shave. It does what you expect every quality after shave to do, moisturize that skin and soothe it. It does EXACTLY that. It is very soothing and it beats any aftershave i have ever tried. It does not contain alcohol, and this is a plus for me because i have very sensitive skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because I enjoy the scent and overall experience of Proraso shaving soap.  While this balm does a great job of moisturizing and soothing my face post-shave, I find the scent to be overpoweringly chemical.  I can&#x27;t describe it any other way but to say that it smells  strongly lotion-esque, almost like sunscreen.  It would be fine if it smelled that way in the bottle alone, but the scent lingers on my face and overpowers the scent of my soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it wasn&#x27;t for the scent, I&#x27;d use this every day because of how well it works.</li>
    <li> I dunno, for $16, imported from Italy, I expected something...special. Its ok, but seems not that much different from local cheaper brands to me. (Maybe I&#x27;m just not sophisticated enough to tell the difference...)</li>
    <li> For aftershave, I generally use a splash Thayer&#x27;s Witchhazel Toner Unscented and a small amount of Nivea for Men&#x27;s Aftershave Balm Sensitive. This is still my main stay approach to aftershaves, but it shares first place with Proraso&#x27;s Balm (Liquid Cream, whatever...) for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s got a better scent, something I relate to a barbershop. Nivea&#x27;s stuff smells fine and all (chamomile, kinda floral, but light), but Proraso has got the better scent. Also, it contains witchhazel already, meaning a separate application of witch water is not necessary. Proraso goes on smooth, leaves a non-greasy feel (your face should be damp with an application), and doesn&#x27;t require much balm. The only reason to dislike this product is you can&#x27;t buy it locally, as it is Italian made. You might find it, but it&#x27;s hard. Your main resource is the internet. So, it takes time to get to you and since it&#x27;s an international product, price goes up. Roughly $16 dollars. I say it&#x27;s worth it. Especially for a good feeling face. And why wouldn&#x27;t you want to give that handsome mug a treat?</li>
    <li> Proraso Liquid Cream was purchased for a socking stuffer, for our son-in-law, cream was spilling out of envelope it was mailed in, looked in side, container is broken and cream all over.  Can I return?  How do I get my money back?!</li>
    <li> Awesome subtle scent.  Soothing to the skin.  Nice moisturizing effect.  Helps alleviate discomfort from shaving.  Italian origin provides a bit of cache.</li>
    <li> but can be way too pricey. i wait to find it for 10 or 11 bucks on prime and order 2-3 bottles. wonderful stuff though.</li>
    <li> This really helps my sensitive skin get over shaving. This bottle lasts for several months, and thanks to Amazon, the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I used this Proraso product for the first time today. It has a cooling, soothing effect but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell-- it&#x27;s like flowers or weeds or cut grass or something.</li>
    <li> I used this product last night for the first time after a good traditional wet shave. It does what you expect every quality after shave to do, moisturize that skin and soothe it. It does EXACTLY that. It is very soothing and it beats any aftershave i have ever tried. It does not contain alcohol, and this is a plus for me because i have very sensitive skin. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very quick dry. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Best aftershave ever!  Goes on creamy, smell is faint and manly, lasts a long time.  Been using it since I first tried it a couple years back.</li>
    <li> This after-shave beats all bar none, difficult to find in local markets, makes all the trouble locating worthwhile, mildly scented liquid cream with just the right thickness, will not clash with most everyday cologne fragrances, categorize brand as Old World machismo with a touch of class, nostalgic barbershop feel for ole &amp; new school males. Highly recommend this after-shave ladies, remember Valentine&#x27;s Day is right around the corner so keep this product in mind!!!</li>
    <li> As with all of the Proraso products I have tried, this one performs well. It goes on creamy but is absorbed quickly and gives instant relief from all of the after effects of a good close shave. It is lightly scented when applying but even that fades quickly, so for all intents and purposes it is unscented. I have had no issues with residue and no ill effects at all with this product. I recommend it without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I am loving it. Because of oatmeal it feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;Bye bye alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I got even their foam shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will keep using until I come across another better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I shave my head and this is good stuff for my scalp as well as my face. Quick drying and nice smelling.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I have always had irritations and they have actually disappeared.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice for my husband. He love it........would love it even more if the container could be non-glass and safer for travel.</li>
    <li> Great aftershave for my sensitive skin. Soothing and calming, the scent doesn&#x27;t hang around forever either. I&#x27;ll be ordering my next bottle shortly.</li>
    <li> As with all Proraso products this is a excellent product and it takes very little to do the job!  No negatives to report. Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this after shave and it makes my skin feel velvety smooth. I have never in the past used after shave, but this product may convert me. I wish the bottle had a rounded shape rather than square, just so it&#x27;d be easier to get the last little bit out.</li>
    <li> As I have read in some other reviews, I found this not to be the original formulation, which I really liked. I would not purchase this again until the formulation reverts back to the original but how does one know when that happens? A conundrum!!! Anyway too bad for me, I really liked the original. I hope some of this feedback gets back to Proraso.</li>
    <li> This stuff as a bit of a funny smell, but natural, and smooth. The smell won&#x27;t last long, but turns into a faint, clean scent after about 15 minutes. I can tell a difference on my face, it does wonders. I usually use the green proraso stuff, which is a liquid aftershave (my favorite smell!), but when I want to use another scent, like a cologne, I use this liquid cream. I ordered from Jet Beauty Supplies and they great. I highly reccomend them.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after-shave after a lot of research.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend mall prices for item&#x27;s like \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot;.  I also have allergies, so I didn&#x27;t want a heavy scented product either.  I was lead to the Proraso Liquid Cream after-shave.  It has a light scent, and coverage is descent.  I did like that my face would dry up within a few minutes and require a second coating of the product to keep it feeling moisturized.  Unfortunately I ended up spending the money on Twinluxe which was a LOT more expensive, however I only have to use a tiny bit and it lasts all day, without a greasy or heavy feel.  Compared to store bought Nivea which was what I used prior, I prefer Proraso.  I is definately and improvement to box store items, but still a ways to go.</li>
    <li> Great product and am completely satisfied. No issues whatsoever. Will recommend to anyone interested in this product. Will do business again with.</li>
    <li> I have tried various aftershaves from inexpensive ones like Nivea and Aqua Velva to expensive products like Aveda Dual Action after shave.  After using the Proraso soap for ultra sensitive skin, I wanted to continue my quest of fighting irritation and razor burn after a shave.  I have always had discomfort when it comes to shaving, and shaving has always been a chore until now.  Since I started using Proraso products, I actually thing it is fun to shave.  I only need to use a small amount to get the effectiveness I need.  The price is not bad and I feel that the bottle with last me a few months at the rate I am going.  With the effectiveness of the this product, and that other Proraso products I have used, I can see why they have been in business for several decades.  I really like how it is bottled in an old fashioned glass bottle.  By using the glass bottle with its product, I feel Proraso properly displaying a classy, effective product.  I would pay $30 for this product if I had to because I like it so much.    If you have sensitive skin and want to join the fight against razor burn and irritation, I suggest using this product.  It is a very light lotion, and will instantly sooth your skin while working for several hours afterward.</li>
    <li> Very mildly scented, fast-absorbing cream. Even though it comes in relatively small bottle I expect that it will go a long way as the cream seems to be of the concentrated variety. A small dab should be enough to cover the entire shaving area. I was also pleased that it is non-greasy as most aftershave lotion/creams leave you with that greasy feel. Another major plus is because this cream has a mild scent (that quickly dissipates) it will not interfere with the wearing of any cologne. This concept seems lost on most other manufacturers and would account for why a significant amount of men walk around smelling like walking department store fragrance counters! Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase of this item and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t tried every aftershave lotion on the market, but I can&#x27;t imagine there is any much better than this for the price. It&#x27;s a great smell, goes on quickly and lasts for a long time! Skin feels very smooth and clean afterwards.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. it smells sooooo good. it absorbs quickly and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> have bought this 2X already - love it. the best after-shave I have ever used. I have sensitive skin and i works wonders. No redness - i sometimes shave every two days (lucky i guess) and still wear it everyday - i have had one ingrown hair in the past year.</li>
    <li> Perfect light aroma and just enough of a sting to let serve to prevent bacteria spread into micro abbrasions</li>
    <li> This product gives your face a really good fresh feeling. I use it every time I shave and it helps prevent bumps form popping up.</li>
    <li> Never been much on after shave due to burning, or to feeling greasy and oily. A dab will do you with this stuff and it does a great job. Just shave, rinse with warm water then cold water (as you should anyway) and then rub a few drops on this into your skin and you&#x27;ll feel exhilarated.</li>
    <li> I love this ,but of course,its from Proraso.The scent is pretty mild,but the scent is nothing like the scent of the green Proraso shave cream and soap,but its a nice clean scent.Doesnt really have much of a menthol kick and didnt leave my face feeling greasy and the added witch hazel and allantoin really help sooth irritation .Non alcohol for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this great balm.</li>
    <li> The product as pictured was the old version, which is what I really wanted. The new reformulated product is what shipped.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on nicely like a lotion and has a different smell than their regular stuff- its ok overall. I have sensitive skin and love Proraso&#x27;s regular line of products but this white label &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; line is too sensitive for me. I&#x27;ll stick to the regular proraso pre/post shave cream which is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower &amp; wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100&#x27;s on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don&#x27;t press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I&#x27;ve tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don&#x27;t want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3&#x27;s are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you&#x27;ll notice a difference overnight.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any allergies but unfortunately I do have a sensitive skin. Which is why I had to stop using multiple-blade razors and shaving foam that comes out of a can (electric shaving, should you be wondering, is something that after a couple of try-outs I suspect inmates at Guantanomo Bay are subjected to). Alcohol-based aftershaves are nice, but there&#x27;s a price to pay: they make even the smallest cut bleed and leave the skin dry and brittle. After a lot of irritation, I finally found the perfect after-shave, presumably based on argan oil, but 1. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not available in the States as it&#x27;s also really difficult to find in Europe and 2. it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive - and they just doubled the price! (the brand is Katima&#x27;a, should you be wondering). This, however, is the next best thing. In fact it is _the_ best thing as it&#x27;s really good value for money and it doesn&#x27;t make you feel unduly sophisticated. It unfailingly prevents irritation, it doesn&#x27;t leave a layer of grease on your skin (and shirt collar) and the discreet and pleasant scent vanishes a couple of minutes after application so you don&#x27;t smell like a baby for the rest of the day. What else could you wish for?  Now I&#x27;m not sure that what works for me works for everybody (I&#x27;m no scientist) but I do know that it&#x27;s cheap enough to take a chance if you think, reading this review, that it might work for you.  I also like the other Proraso products (the shaving cream tube and the pre-shave cream are great) but they just work extremely well. This really solved a problem.</li>
    <li> I heard they reformulated their liquid cream after shave, they missed the mark on the new formula. I liked the old formula better.</li>
    <li> Formula seems to have changed once again (in the last year.) More milky texture and appearance; seems to have more water than my last bottle. Works as its supposed to, though.&lt;br /&gt;Sure wish we could still get the old green top Proraso after shave cream!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably try some other product for my next bottle...</li>
    <li> This cream is quite good. Just a little sting but it goes away. I am using the hot towel method where I do a cold water rinse, dry, add the aftershave, use a hot towel and reply the aftershave. At this point the face is unbelievably smooth. I also use the fantastic Proraso shaviny cream. I just add a moisturaizer and a cologne.</li>
    <li> This s*** is great. Cool and soothing.  A little goes a long way.  Nice temporary citrus scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using my second bottle. I shave with a razor about 1-2 times a week. This is the only product that soothes razor burn and isn&#x27;t oily. I like the odor but it could be less strong.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin to the point that its almost impossible for me to shave without getting terrible razor burn on my face/under my chin area. This certainly helps considering there isn&#x27;t any alcohol, it doesn&#x27;t completely cure my razor burn problem but it helps. I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since I first bought it around a year ago so that speaks for itself.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid user of NIVEA replenishing post shave balm for years.  I pay under $6.00 for a 3.3 fluid ounce bottle.  I decided to give the Proraso after shave a try because of all the reviews.  I tried the Proraso aftershave for a week and I am very disappointed.  First, there is barley any scent to it unlike the scented NIVEA.  Second, the Proraso is more watery than the NIVEA.  Finally, I did not notice any better result or feel using the Proraso.  I did expect that for $17 for 3.4 fluid ounces that I would get a better feel and result from the aftershave.  I am guessing that the reason for the high price is due to the cost of importing it here to the States.  Save your money.  There are better alternatives out there for much less money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Proraso Liquid Cream After-shave for some time now and will recommend it to all.&lt;br /&gt;This aftershave presents a clean and refreshing scent that feels great going on and does not linger. It is not oily of greasy like many other cream based after-shaves - nor does it present an alcohol &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; to your just-shaved face. Frankly, it lives up to it&#x27;s reputation and history as a preferred aftershave by many barbers.  Absolutely work the try.  You won&#x27;t be dis-appointed.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this this after shave cream.  It&#x27;s very soothing as well.  I use this when my skin gets irritated in the dry winter and it helps immensely.  This is great stuff.</li>
    <li> The is not the original Proraso liquid cream aftershave product. This smells like Tea Tree oil and flowers and is in a square bottle, not the flask-shaped bottle. I hate this new smell. Beware!</li>
    <li> I picked this after shave to see how it performed compared to my AOS after shave moisturizer since it cost less.  Proraso does cost less but is not as effective as AOS moisture wise. However it performs well enough for the price and will be great for the humid summer months.  I will purchase then again for $18 rather than spending double ($40) for the same 3.4 ounces.</li>
    <li> IMHO, this lotion has a great smell. No, the best smell. I shave my face and head, and both are smooth and not oily.</li>
    <li> Smells like tulips and does a great job with soothing shaved skin.</li>
    <li> This product has a wonderful smell and doesn&#x27;t give the burn that alcohol based after-shaves have given me in the past. This keeps irritation down while making my face feel soft and supple</li>
    <li> Love this after shave. I had been using store brands over the years, always hating the burning sensation afterward. Only after doing some reading did i realize that non-alcohol after shave lotions/balms were the way to go. After reading positive reviews on Amazon, i ordered one for myself and have been using it since then.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and need an alcohol free aftershave, and luckily found this. The smell is very pleasant and it goes on smooth. It does not leave my face greasy or tight, like other aftershaves have done. A great balm for wet shaving!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with walmart gear for the last 20 years. I finally stepped up, got a good safety razor and learned how to shave the old fashion way. This aftershave is the perfect end to a wonderful shaving experience.</li>
    <li> I use many Proraso products, but this one was a disappointment.  It seems to be the exactly the same product as, \\&quot;Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm, Active Comfort System.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;This aftershave has a very liquid consistency, it looks like milk.  The liquid consistency makes it difficult to coat the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse it irritates my skin after applied, OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;This product does not sting, rather within 3 minuets of applying it the skin turn red and raw.  Also somehow this lotion opens up previous closed nicks, YUK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely amazed how bad this product is, especially considering how great other Proraso products are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes... the Nivea product mention above gets the same review as this Proraso item.</li>
    <li> love the smell. makes my face look/feel very smooth. like it just as much as the clinique men&#x27;s shaving products.</li>
    <li> When I first began DE shaving (about 7 months ago) I read a lot of great things about Proraso&#x27;s products.  I invested the time and research then eventually money into their shaving products.  I loved their shaving cream, soap and after shave (the liquid kind).  So then I wanted something for the winter.  I figured the lotion would be perfect.  I began reading that the company&#x27;s formula changed along with their new packaging.  So I went received the new lotion, \\&quot;Proaso Liquid Cream\\&quot; I was excited.  I opened up the bottle and took a whiff.  Yuck.  This is not the pleasant smell I am used to with this company.  So I&#x27;m not going to use it and most likely return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad too, if their formula&#x27;s changed then there&#x27;s a good chance their products will too.  Im beginning to look elsewhere for my future shaving products.  It&#x27;s a shame, I really liked their other stuff.  Im not the only one who has felt this way about their new products.  Other users have been saying the same.  Just look around.  Hope something changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I should note, the race reviews (if you look at the dates of them) are mostly before the product change.  Just an FYI.</li>
    <li> I do not know what they were thinking with all of these reformulations of what were once excellent products.  I have written about the pre-shave that if you have never used it before you will probably like it, but if you have you will be extremely disappointed with the new formulation.  With the after-shave I do not think anyone could really think this is anything but a disaster for Proraso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance there is not much change.  It is slightly lighter in color and thinner than the original (probably necessary for it to flow out of the new squared-corner, flat-top bottle design--that&#x27;s right no more cool, re-usable flask).  It is slightly more watery and does not feel quite as good to the skin as the original formulation but this is a minor issue.  The real problem is the godawful smell.  It reminds me of my grandma&#x27;s bathroom--not sure if it was the rose toilet water or the Glade air freshener--but it is putrid.  Use it if you want to smell like an old woman all day.  Otherwise, there are plenty of options that not only smell better but also work better than this formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next week I will be opening my new formulation shaving soap.  If the pre-shave and after-shave are any indication, I might as well go back to Barbasol and disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Has replaced all other aftershave.  Will buy again and for gifts.</li>
    <li> It appears that either Proraso has changed their formula or there are 2 different items with similar names. The 1st purchase came in a hip-flask like bottle with a green cap and contained witch hazel (as shown in photo at Amazon). The 2nd order was is a shorter bottle with a black cap and different ingredients, not containing witch hazel. The witch hazel was what I liked about the product helping to close your pores. I will probaly send back this 2nd order and see if I can find the original product. (Unfortunatly the Proraso site is in Italian, so i couldn&#x27;t determine if they changed the formula).&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE; I was able to determine that the Proraso formula has changed. Too bad, I really liked that product. It remains to be seen if the new formula is as good.</li>
    <li> After using this product for several months, I give it 5 stars. My shaving ritual is a little backwards compared to most.&lt;br /&gt;I shave prior to the shower and so when I get out and my facial pores are wide open from the hot water, I dry my face off a little then apply&lt;br /&gt;the cream. It soaks in like crazy and does not leave a oily residue. It has a very pleasant scent but does not linger or compete with&lt;br /&gt;my cologne. On a side note, I am very pleased with all the Proraso products that I have tried and would recommend them without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the purchase.  Used the product for the first time yesterday.  I would highly recommend this product. Enjoy....</li>
    <li> I hate alcohol based after shave, but this liquid cream by Proraso smells great and keeps my face moisturized and protected following my straight razor shaves (also with Proraso shaving soap). It may seem like a high price for so little, but believe me that a little of this goes a long way. You will love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve made multiple purchases of this lotion. It&#x27;s great for after shaving. Has a smooth feel to it. The bottle is glass so this liquid is not very thick but it is thick enough to feel smooth on the face and provide  a nice soothing feeling. Leaves one with a good after shave experience.</li>
    <li> Aftershave is great for irratation and redness. It absorbs quickly and leaves skin silky smooth. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent so you could apply some aftershave cologne if you wanted to. Not much product is necessary to use so this bottle will last me quite a awhile.</li>
    <li> I wanted the old formula because it was the one shown in the picture. However, I received the new formula. It works well on my sensitive skin, though I do prefer the new formula Proraso Green Aftershave. This, however, is better than Geo. F. Trumper&#x27;s Lime Skin Food.</li>
    <li> This after-shave cream is excellent. I generally stay away from scented after-shave lotions, but tried this out after reading some other reviews. The smell is light and refreshing, and the lotion is soothing. I will buy this again for sure!</li>
    <li> I got into the high end shaving stuff I bought this stuff reluctantly and now I will not buy anything else it works great with the same brand of shaving soap and preshaving cream and blades</li>
    <li> This is not the product as pictured. The one pictured is the previous formulation - the one which was delivered is the new formulation (tea trea), which comes in a square bottle. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t like the new formulation nearly as much and the bottle is smaller. Not sure why Proraso changed it, but be aware that you aren&#x27;t ordering what is in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this formulation for a while I really don&#x27;t care for it. Sad because I loved the old version. Buyer be aware!</li>
    <li> Not bad, but a little &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; on your face... particularly if you use a just little too much. I&#x27;ve experimented with lots of options since switching to wet shaving and prefer other brands for an aftershave overall - BUT - I do switch my routine up frequently and I do LOVE the feel of Proraso&#x27;s Pre and Post Shave Cream as an alternative.</li>
    <li> I really like this aftershave.  It&#x27;s not overpowering, cools the skin, and overall feels really nice.  It dries fast, which is a bonus for me since I often fly out the door and put on a motorcycle helmet.</li>
    <li> This product has a nice feel to it after any kind of shave.  It is free of alcohol, hence does not burn.  It leaves&lt;br /&gt;the skin feeling soft and refreshed.  It also has a nice scent.  However, it should have been put into a bottle&lt;br /&gt;with a scent dispenser. As it is, you have to shake the bottle to get the liquid out, and just a few drops come out&lt;br /&gt; and sometimes nothing at all.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I think this is kind of old fashioned and inefficient.&lt;br /&gt;Give this product a try anyway.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> This is definitely NOT the product I have been using, Don&#x27;t like the feel; don&#x27;t like the fragrance; and definitely do NOT like the way my skin feels with this stuff on it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to find an aftershave that did not contain alcohol.  Mary Kay has a real good one I&#x27;ve been trying, but it does contain some alcohol - though not anything like the crummy brands do.  So, I tried this as an alternative.  And it works very well.  I like it better than brands that are primarily Aloe based.  Aloe based aftershaves leave a noticeable &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; feel for me.  They&#x27;re fine - just not my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This aftershave smells fine, is not overpowering, does not sit on you all day long and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; feel.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the Proraso white-line shave soap bowl and preshave.  I have always gotten bad razor burn and switched to a Merkur DE safety razor. I love the blade and it helped with the burn. But, the Proraso line gives me basically the same shave as every other soap I have tried (Art of shaving line, nivea for sensitive skin, gillette gels, etc), I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference except that it smells different. And, honestly, the smell is not that great, kind of sterile and soapy, not refreshing at all.  The Preshave has menthol which gives a cooling sensation during the shave, but as soon as I wash it off I stop feeling it and the red burn pops up.  The only good thing that came of this purchase was that I was given a free sample of Billy Jealousy products which gave me a smooth shave with much less irritation.  The smoothness lasted for a long time and it felt like shaving with WD40, very nice.</li>
    <li> This thing right here can do miracles. No razer bumps or redness after i apply it. I use a straight razer BTW.</li>
    <li> I generally have really expensive tastes when it comes to shaving and I use the Art of Shaving products. But, I heard a lot of great things about Proraso and decided to try it. This stuff is good and costs relatively next to nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth be told, it actually keeps me moisturized after a wet shave longer than the aftershave balm AoS produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Proraso hits another home run with this after shave balm. It is very soothing, contains no alcohol and will moisturize your face and make it look like glass. It has a very minimal light scent which is good and not overpowering. Can be used at night before bed without offending your significant other. This could probably be used as a face moisturizer since it is so soothing.</li>
    <li> I liked the co. Bigelow barber aftershave better. I got this as an alternative not impressed.  I wish i had paid the extra for the bigelow barber.</li>
