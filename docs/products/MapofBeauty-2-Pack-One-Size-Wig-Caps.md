      <li>Good ship time</li>
      <li>Good seller.</li>
      <li>These wig caps fit real good!!!</li>
      <li>A good buy, thank you.</li>
      <li>I should have gotten a darker color (I didn&#x27;t think that one out), and the quality is good.</li>
      <li>Wife is pleased with these.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>but the product seems to work ok for my friend.  </li>
      <li>the circumference fit</li>
      <li>I tried them on and they fit</li>
      <li>I guess I will opt for caps that allow size choices so I won&#x27;t be stuck with caps that don&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>One size does fit all.</li>
      <li>I will have to dye it light brown to use it.</li>
      <li>Color light creamy.</li>
      <li>Great wig caps, holds my long hair into place.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think my wig felt as secure as my other better fitting wig caps provided.</li>
      <li>Seriously, they are really nice and comfortable!</li>
      <li>Overall for how inexpensive they are, I guess they are okay.  </li>
      <li>That being said, I think the wig caps had too much material,</li>
      <li>It is nice that are two of them in the package for such a low price.</li>
      <li>but if I pulled it flat to my skull the edge went well over my brow, when I pulled the brow of the cap to the right spot</li>
      <li>The cap does not fit tightly and has an orange color to it which does not look good with lace front wigs.</li>
      <li>I took the wig caps out and they look like they are years old as well.  </li>
      <li>The packaging looked like it was really old</li>
      <li>Took a little while getting here, but it was worth it!</li>

<li> They hide my dark hair for wearing under a blonde wig.</li>
<li> Sits fine on my head, but after putting on a wig, they slide off like crazy.</li>
<li> Probably because of my long, thick hair, and not actually an issue with the product itself, but it&#x27;s still kind of annoying.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s too loose where the tight band is and over time, starts to move off my head.</li>
<li> It helps her tolerate wigs for a longer time than she could previously.  </li>
<li> This was a gift and delivery was a little slow</li>
<li> too small, and i have a small head too</li>
<li> It is a bit thin and flimsy but can&#x27;t complain due to the price.</li>

    <li> Good seller. Product great, as described. Good ship time</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for me! One size does fit all.</li>
    <li> If you have a big head I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> Color light creamy. I will have to dye it light brown to use it.</li>
    <li> These wig caps fit real good!!!</li>

    <li> Wig caps. They work. They hide my dark hair for wearing under a blonde wig.</li>
    <li> great for wigs of all kinds</li>
    <li> The cap holds all of my hair but it&#x27;s too loose where the tight band is and over time, starts to move off my head.</li>
    <li> You definitely need these to keep your wig from sliding around on your head! A good buy, thank you.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and delivery was a little slow but the product seems to work ok for my friend.  It helps her tolerate wigs for a longer time than she could previously.  Her scalp is tender from hair loss following chemo so having a buffer for those scratchy wigs is helpful.</li>
    <li> The cap does not fit tightly and has an orange color to it which does not look good with lace front wigs.</li>
    <li> Great wig caps, holds my long hair into place.</li>

    <li> I should have gotten a darker color (I didn&#x27;t think that one out), and the quality is good. That being said, I think the wig caps had too much material, the circumference fit but if I pulled it flat to my skull the edge went well over my brow, when I pulled the brow of the cap to the right spot then I had excess room in the cap at the back. I don&#x27;t think my wig felt as secure as my other better fitting wig caps provided. I guess I will opt for caps that allow size choices so I won&#x27;t be stuck with caps that don&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m neutral since I bought this to use with a costume wig. It is a bit thin and flimsy but can&#x27;t complain due to the price. It did take awhile to get to me though.</li>
    <li> Sits fine on my head, but after putting on a wig, they slide off like crazy. Probably because of my long, thick hair, and not actually an issue with the product itself, but it&#x27;s still kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> I finally recieved this package about a month after I ordered it.  I initially didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from overseas.  The packaging looked like it was really old and like it has been sitting in a warehouse for years.  I took the wig caps out and they look like they are years old as well.  I tried them on and they fit okay but they don&#x27;t always stay in place like you would need them to.  Overall for how inexpensive they are, I guess they are okay.  I don&#x27;t wear my wig often so this will do for the times that I do.  It is nice that are two of them in the package for such a low price.</li>
