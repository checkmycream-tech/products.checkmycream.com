    <li> This is a super thick, body butter. I really like it and would buy again</li>
    <li> Love this body butter. It&#x27;s creamy and smells great!</li>
    <li> Very rich and creamy, absorbs well leaving your skin very soft. Many good oils listed in the ingredients, but not quite sure why its called milk and honey. They are not listed... must be the colour?</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product about a year and half ago at a Sam&#x27;s Club road show. I bought it there at a great price however, Amazons price is better. A little of this product goes a long way so use it sparingly. It is a great moisturizer and it smells awesome. Yes, it&#x27;s my favorite body butter!</li>
    <li> These products ARE all they are cracked up to be. This lotion is like silk. And you can stop searching. Everywhere from the mall to other sites online charge up to $50 for the same size jar :o) enjoy</li>
    <li> I was introduced to the Avani Dead Sea Natural Mineral Body Scrub, a companion product to the rich body butter, while visiting Kona, HI.  I was skeptical  but tried the combination of the scrub and butter and it really does work. My feet were so rough and excoriated that I thought nothing would ever soften them but with weekly use of the two my feet are getting in good condition.</li>
    <li> My father in law has a very dry skin problem that he has tried many creams and medicines for Avani body butter is his best friend. Finally something that works</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and makes you feel soft.</li>
    <li> Great texture. Moisturizes without greasy residue or having vapor that stings the eyes. Great for feet to put on during the day to moisturize and take away friction from socks/shoes. Great for massage.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite body butter so far.  Love the fragrance</li>
    <li> Best body butter ever!!!!Its not greasy. It&#x27;s worth the $$$!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Use it after the milk and honey body scrub. You will not be disapointed.  Skin feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product over 4 weeks ago. And still haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use it.  I ordered the scrub and liked how it left my skin.  But till waiting for body butter.  :-(</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the Dead Sea Body Scrub of the same brand for myself for myself for that dry winter skin. They are amazing products that I look forward to using. The body butter is super rich and the scent is soothing. A must have! Would make great gifts too.</li>
    <li> My skin is typical middle aged, dry skin.  This butter is thick, luscious, and goes on heavy.  I normally prefer something lighter, however, it doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb.  I only use it a couple times a week, but it could be used daily.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth and youthful.</li>
    <li> I actually like this product normally.  This particular one was much thicker and kind of dried out.  It&#x27;s usable, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Because it feat my skin type and work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend that to everybody to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my grandma as a birthday gift, and she absolutely loves it! It&#x27;s a beautifully creamy lotion, and smells amazing! I definitely recommend for someone who loves body butter that is not too oily.</li>
    <li> I loved this so much, I ordered additional jars for Christmas presents. Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried for dry skin and I like the fragrance.</li>
    <li> smells really nice and feels nice</li>
    <li> Not only is this body butter wonderful for my skin but the fragrance is awesome! I will buy this again before I run out of it!! I would highly recommend this product to others!!</li>
    <li> Needed some day cream. Thought it would smell more like Milk and Honey, just smells like regular body cream. It is rich and softens my skin tho, am using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so bad, I threw up because of the smell.  I do not recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Love the product but the aroma was not there... that was the reason for that purchase ... wonder where the beautiful smell went ..... was not there.......</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this body butter. It smells great and has a nice consistency, ensuring I&#x27;ll actually use it.</li>
    <li> Smells good but really doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin any better then regular lotion I by.</li>
    <li> The product itself was great as I have used it before and that is why I wanted it again.  What I was unhappy with, was the time it took to get to my house.  I understand when I buy something online it takes sometime (usually 7-10 business days) to get to me through the mail, but this took OVER A MONTH from the time I ordered it to the time it arrived.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I used it on my feet. We have hardwood floors and my feet were so soft that I nearly slipped and fell.</li>
    <li> I just received this and I really don&#x27;t like it because it smells strange and I don&#x27;t like the way it feels. It is thick and goes on white, so you need to really rub it in. My skin did not feel particularly moist afterward. I was hoping that it would be better that the Bath and Body lotions, but it was not. They smell better and feel about the same (after you rub it in).</li>
    <li> I am Disappointed in this product. I smell like vanilla cake after I put it on, and the texture of butter just like Vaseline with some extra ingredients.</li>
    <li> For the girl of the house, she loves it</li>
    <li> It softens my skin, I can actually see the difference....and to know it&#x27;s all natural makes it even better. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a rich body butter that is not greasy or oily.  I have very dry skin, and this product leaves my skin soft and supple.  I thought it was pricy, however when I compare it to my other lotions it is less expensive, because I don&#x27;t have to use much to be effective.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on the milk and honey body butter and I really like it.  I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to different scents but the milk and honey doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It&#x27;s just a beautiful scent.  The body butter just seems so rich.  It&#x27;s cold all winter where I live and your skin can really dry out.  I used the body butter most days, especially on my legs.</li>
    <li> i love this stuff! It really does make a difference on your skin, and it lasts for a long time too. great buy for sure.</li>
    <li> Wish this was available in other scents and on the market.  This item was sold at Sam&#x27;s Club by way of a roadshow which is an in and out item.  Wish I could get it in other places.</li>
    <li> What a bony cream my skin never felt better and looked so young</li>
    <li> Delightful smell!  Very buttery.</li>
    <li> The only body butter I will use!  Great light smell and long lasting moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I like this very much but not quite like what I have purchased from the Avani store.</li>
    <li> Love these! i was introduced to this product by a co-worker and I absolutely love them. Plus it smells great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the greatest for soothing many things.  Never caused me any problem on my problems.  I keep several of these in my home.</li>
    <li> This product definitely gets 5 stars from me.  I love, love this hand cream - the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Product does NOT smell good at all. I have used another brand and the milk and honet scent was divine. I tried this brand as it 1/2 the price....wish I had bought the more expensive product.Huge difference,would not purchase again even to save the&lt;br /&gt;Money.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful body butter,with the best ingre. Does not leave a mess on my skin,but my skin drinks it up.</li>
