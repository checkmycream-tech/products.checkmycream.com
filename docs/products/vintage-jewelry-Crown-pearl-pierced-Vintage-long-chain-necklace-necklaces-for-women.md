<li> I gave it to my 32 year old daughter as a gift</li>
<li> It&#x27;s also bigger than I expected</li>
<li> It came a few days early, but the pearl is actually an inch or so around, the bottom is uneven, and the figures on the sides barely look at all like the picture.</li>
<li> The necklace is a little big, but I adore the look and the color!</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical at first because I was scared the Crown and pearl would be small.</li>
<li> It came broken in half.</li>
<li> Poorly made.</li>
<li> Poor quality.</li>
<li> broken chain, but fixable</li>
<li> This is very poorly made although I figured it would be for the price.</li>
<li> Extremely bad quality.</li>
<li> The dimonds are badly glued and the design imprinted on the metel is nothing like the picture.</li>
<li> Really ugly.</li>
<li> I still like the necklace, but am very disappointed in the company&#x27;s representation of the product.</li>

    <li> It came a few days early, but the pearl is actually an inch or so around, the bottom is uneven, and the figures on the sides barely look at all like the picture. Also, you can see glue in several places.

This product is probably worth a dollar at most.</li>
