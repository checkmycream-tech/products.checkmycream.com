    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE. AND I DO LOVE IT. IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL SO SOFT AND CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;  I WILL CONTINUE USING EB5.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my 81 year old Mom and she looks 70 because she&#x27;s been using it a long time.  I just wish it would be a little cheaper because of her fixed income but I guess you pay to be beautiful.</li>
    <li> My purchase of EB5 was perfect.  I had always ordered this product direct from EB5 Web site, never though I could get it on Amazon.  What a surprise!  I ordered several tubes of the Facial Cleanser, its perfect, what I have always used.  Came shipped to me very quickly and in perfect shape.  I will continue to purchase it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this cream. She used to be able to buy it in Puerto Rico but they no longer sale it over the island. I purchased it here but to my surprise I wasn&#x27;t able to ship from your warehouse to Puerto Rico. I had to have it ship to my house and then re shipped to Puerto Rico. That is just ridiculous so much for buying on line I guess. I had to go to the post office stand in line for two hours to re shipped to my mother.</li>
