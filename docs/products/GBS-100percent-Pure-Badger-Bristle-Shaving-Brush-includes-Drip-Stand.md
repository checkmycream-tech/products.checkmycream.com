      <li>If you are thinking of starting to shave with a badger brush, this would be an excellent choice to see if you like it before investing in a more expensive, high quality, badger brush.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, this was my first brush and didn&#x27;t expect much for the price.</li>
      <li>but I certainly can&#x27;t recommend with the knot coming out.</li>

      <li>Lost a few hairs during the first uses but hasn´t lost any more after that.</li>
      <li>so I have nothing to compare it to, but I highly recommend this brush.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered a highly rated 24mm silvertip (not GBS) and look forward to comparing its lather-making ability to this GBS.</li>

      <li>Pure Badger Black Shaving Brush with Free Stand From GBS.</li>
      <li>Works ok, but has been losing a few hairs with every use since new.  </li>

      <li>My old one is about 50 years old.</li>
      <li>GBS is a sales partner working through Amazon and the product shipped directly through them</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve started to bike commute to work and needed an extra brush to keep in my work locker for getting ready in the morning.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I think I made an investment into the future and hope it lasts me at least a decade!</li>
      <li>This brush is very small and comfortable to hold in your hand</li>

    <li> The stem separated from the brush needs to be reglued!  The brush tends to shed very easily!</li>
    <li> Pure Badger Black Shaving Brush with Free Stand From GBS. For lovers of classic shave, even for those with sensitive skin, this brush is super great at a super price badger, it is a quality brush.</li>
    <li> This is an inexpensive brush.  Very similar to the SimplyBeutiful basic 100% badger (almost identical).  The brush is just a bit prickly on the face, but not bad.  The brush does has a bit of smell to it, but it is bothersome (at least the one I got).  Brush does lose a few hairs, but this is sometimes normal at the beginning.  brush dries well.  For the money it is not a bad deal.</li>
    <li> I used the brush today and it was a huge improvement over my old one. My old one is about 50 years old.</li>
    <li> This is the first brush I have ever bought so I have nothing to compare it to, but I highly recommend this brush.  It&#x27;s affordable, lathers well with Proraso in a tub, comfortable to grip, and again it&#x27;s very affordable!  Give the brush and tub cream a try!!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush &amp; stand.  Good buy for the money.  Much better shave than with the old worn out brush.</li>
    <li> So far it has been working fine, I have had more then 20 shaves and apart from a few drops, it works fine.</li>
    <li> Brush is so small it looks toy, plastic brush holder fits so tight I threw it in the trash. I bought two the other was a gift that I won&#x27;t give.</li>
    <li> This brush is very small and comfortable to hold in your hand I prefer the smaller brushes and this one is very functional and works great. It is not a toy. It provides a great amount of control when building lather in a bowl and works great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good brush for the coin. I use it for travel and it&#x27;s great there.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for 4 months every other day. The knot became loose after 2 months then came out. I must confess I did dry it using an electric hand dryer at the gym. I glued it back in but unfortunately it is a bit crooked - : ). Disappointed in the quality in that the knot fell out and the GBS emblem rubbed off after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this was my first brush and didn&#x27;t expect much for the price. It does create a good amount of lather with creams and is soft. I will continue to use it occasionally. I have ordered a highly rated 24mm silvertip (not GBS) and look forward to comparing its lather-making ability to this GBS. Not a bad brush for a beginner but I certainly can&#x27;t recommend with the knot coming out.</li>
    <li> exlent well made brush it looks nice it looks good i like it yes i do you should bay one forest gump</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a strait razor back in March and got an inexpensive starter kit. The brush started to shed really bad back in November, and wouldn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape. I ordered this one for Christmas and it came in a day early, has some good weight to it, and is an excellent quality brush for anyone who is starting out brush shaving or has been doing it for a while and just needs a good brush. A few dollars more is nothing when it comes to quality and this brush has the quality of a $60 brush or more. Definitely worth the $25 I paid for it after tax and shipping.</li>
    <li> Not a horrible buy, but it&#x27;s cheap and it shows.  Works ok, but has been losing a few hairs with every use since new.  You can purchase an excellent quality boar brush for the price of this cheap badger.</li>
    <li> Rated low because GBS didn&#x27;t send the product I ordered.  I wanted a brush with a stand for proper drying of the brush after use.  Instead of this, GBS substituted a travel brush and no stand.  Amazon quickly refunded my purchase but I had to look elsewhere for a new shaving brush.  GBS is a sales partner working through Amazon and the product shipped directly through them and it wasn&#x27;t a Prime product so there was a cost for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up getting a Badger brush by Escali which was part of Amazon Prime and had no problems with shipment, delivery or the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started to bike commute to work and needed an extra brush to keep in my work locker for getting ready in the morning.  The brush is a little smaller than the one I have at home (The Art of Shaving) but works very well and can&#x27;t be beat at the price.  If you are thinking of starting to shave with a badger brush, this would be an excellent choice to see if you like it before investing in a more expensive, high quality, badger brush.</li>
    <li> For the price, a great brush.  no complaints</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been 3 days since I got my Parker Safety Razor Badger Bristle Brush and its changed the shaving experience for me. It was expensive and I had doubts but I&#x27;m glad I think I made an investment into the future and hope it lasts me at least a decade!</li>
    <li> Fell apart after one week. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my boyfriend and it broke in less than a month</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. Lost a few hairs during the first uses but hasn´t lost any more after that. Smell went off in less than a week and became softer as well. Fits perfect in its stand and dries off properly. I&#x27;ve taken it to a few trips on a zip bag and kept its shape. It works a great lather with just a drop of C.O. Bigelow shaving cream.</li>
