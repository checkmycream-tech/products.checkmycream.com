      <li>/&gt;I am so happy.</li>
      <li>while I &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; it, I wouldn&#x27;t say it was a great purchase.</li>

      <li>Applies very nice.</li>
      <li>Love!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I wear it at night but its kind of oily</li>
      <li>It smells really nice too.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Midnight Recovery is a moisturizer that stands on it own.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the product and how it made my skin feel.</li>
      <li>A very nice light oil.</li>
      <li>It is great, make me handsome and hot</li>
      <li>I love Kiehl products and this is no exception</li>
      <li>but my skin already feels softer and looks better.</li>
      <li>just when I had begun to love the feel of this oil at night and in the morning (just let it sink in a bit if you use it in the morning).  </li>
      <li>and I worry that I may break out more</li>
      <li>I feel like me again! :)</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I see a lot more from Dr Denese and her serum than this.  </li>
      <li>You need to put a lot on just to make sure it covers.</li>
      <li>but I love that smell.  </li>
      <li>Okay okay...</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>(1 forehead, 1 chin, 2 per cheek).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simpler than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and far more effective!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Midnight Recovery for about 2 months now, and I&#x27;m really happy at how soft my skin feels now.  </li>
      <li>As many with combination/sensitive skin are, I&#x27;m fairly rigid with my skin routine because new products tend to stress my skin out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It did not irritate my skin more and when/if you find the ingredient list you&#x27;ll see it does, in fact, contain lots of good natural skin boosters (like squalene and cucumber extract).</li>
      <li>the texture is smooth and it absorbs very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this concentrate in October after being given a sample at Kiehl&#x27;s duty free store in the Hong Kong airport.  </li>
      <li>I hope this product will always be available.</li>
      <li>I hope this product will always be available.</li>
      <li>smooth on your skins.</li>
      <li>know I sound like a Kiehl&#x27;s rep</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>MRC does get decent reviews here as well, but not as amazing as on the Kiehl&#x27;s website.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed significant improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and ability to retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this oil for many years and it really has improved my face skin,and the lines on my face have also diminished!</li>
      <li>When I was given the sample, I was catching the 16 hour flight from Hong Kong to New York.  </li>
      <li>In the winter that is saying something special.  </li>
      <li>I only tried it because it got good reviews.  </li>
      <li>When I wake up in the morning, my face appears brighter and more lively!  </li>
      <li>To be totally honest I have not yet seen a significant change in the smaller lines I get around the eyes and mouth</li>
      <li>This facial oil has a beautiful, calming lavender scent and it makes my skin feel baby soft.  </li>
      <li>i really reccomend it!!</li>
      <li>After one year of fighting acne (from coming off the pill) and trying to find the right products for my skin, I have found and stuck to a skin care regime that works for me.  </li>
      <li>I like it even better than the Bare Minerals Overnight Serum.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>Rub coconut oil into skin, remove with hot wash cloth.</li>
      <li>I no longer felt pretty without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, cleanse with coconut oil.</li>
      <li>Leaves my face so smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I love some of their other products (rare earth, microblur, cr&amp;egrave;me de corps are all tops in my book).</li>
      <li>friend kept telling me over and over again how much she loved it, but we have such different skin types that I neglected to try the sample she gave me for months.</li>
      <li>I have extraordinarily oily, blemish-prone, sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>but more importantly, my dry skin (including lips, under the nose and around the eyes) has disappeared.</li>
      <li>I finished up a sample and decided I needed the whole thing.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I think those who are reviewing it as an oily product are using too much of it.</li>
      <li>I say this reluctantly because I really want to like it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on very oily!&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It does absorb insanely fast into my skin.</li>
      <li>It is quickly absorbed, easily applied without leaving a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; appearance, and definitely makes fine lines less visible!</li>
      <li>Personally I think it is a good alternative to Estee Lauder and all the more expensive products.</li>
      <li>I love Kiehl&#x27;s products, but this Midnight Recovery Concentrate brings my approval to a new level---it surpasses other serums and night repair types.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes but will not be buying this again.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend to anyone.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product: keeps skin near my eyes very soft and smooth in the morning, the only drawback is that it is bit pricey.</li>
      <li>my entire life (I&#x27;m 28 years old now) and have tried tons of products, from Retin-A, Differin gel, and Proactiv to Clean and Clear spot gel and four different birth control pills, and absolutely nothing stopped the consistent breakouts on my chin and jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(my skin always feels super dry after I wash it at night -</li>
      <li>In any case, I won&#x27;t be using their products any more, as the company seems a bit shady to me.</li>
      <li>In the morning, the big, picked at pimple (the kind that usually takes weeks to fully heal) was ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE.</li>
      <li>Apply less if you have a comparatively oily T zone.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft in the morning.</li>
      <li>Also I am always battling large pores and still at 30+ years old get an occasional blemish.  </li>
      <li>This product REALLY has helped balance out my skin, help old breakouts, even out my tone, and even my pores are looking smaller!</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin hydrated and soft.  </li>
      <li>Just to confirm, I used it again for a few days, and sure enough my face got inflamed again</li>
      <li>When I received a bottle of Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery, I was really skeptical on how good it could be.  </li>
      <li>Not sure it helped with fine lines.  </li>
      <li>This goes double for oils (or serums), particularly after my grease-ball adolescence, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product after reading all of the reviews and hearing personal testimonials from some friends.</li>
      <li>There was no initial irritation, likely thanks to its natural and paraben-free ingredient list (according to the Kiehl&#x27;s product description).  </li>
      <li>my friend with less dry skin said she only uses 2 drops) and within a week I noticed my skin had a more even texture and my breakouts were clearing up.</li>
      <li>A little goes a LONG way with this product, so you do feel better about spending the money since the bottle is quite big.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Kiehl&#x27;s products, but this Midnight Recovery Concentrate brings my approval to a new level---it surpasses other serums and night repair types.</li>
    <li> Really perfect! Its perfect for the skin. I like it very much. I can only recommend it. Try it ! Your skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading all of the reviews and hearing personal testimonials from some friends. Although I love the way it feels, it has made my skin break out terribly. I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just a little too oily for my acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for many years and it really has improved my face skin,and the lines on my face have also diminished! i really reccomend it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product due to a recommendation of a friend. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin at all. It does go on oily but seems to soak it. I know some products work for some and not others. I had high hopes but will not be buying this again. Just MY opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin my entire life (I&#x27;m 28 years old now) and have tried tons of products, from Retin-A, Differin gel, and Proactiv to Clean and Clear spot gel and four different birth control pills, and absolutely nothing stopped the consistent breakouts on my chin and jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cue Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Concentrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend kept telling me over and over again how much she loved it, but we have such different skin types that I neglected to try the sample she gave me for months. Finally winter dryness set in and I gave in. I started to use 3 drops every night (my skin always feels super dry after I wash it at night - my friend with less dry skin said she only uses 2 drops) and within a week I noticed my skin had a more even texture and my breakouts were clearing up. I wondered if it was also a new cleanser I was using (noted to be less drying than my previous cleanser) but quickly learned that wasn&#x27;t the case. One night I forgot to use the 3 drops of Kiehl&#x27;s and woke up with a big pimple on my chin. I (grossly...) picked at it that day and cursed myself for the bad habit. That night I washed my face as usual and remembered the Kiehl&#x27;s. In the morning, the big, picked at pimple (the kind that usually takes weeks to fully heal) was ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE. Only a faint red mark reminded me that it had ever been there in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I sound like a Kiehl&#x27;s rep but if you have acne prone skin and have tried everything like me then you know how frustrating it can be to have to suffer through consistent breakouts and then finally FINALLY use a product that actually works. This serum is pricey but I would pay triple the price for these results. No facial, product, or pill has ever come close to helping my skin like this serum has. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t make my skin glow, or reduce the appearance of lines, or anything. It made my face raw, itchy, and irritated. I gave it about a month and a half but had to stop, and my skin is back to normal.  Just to confirm, I used it again for a few days, and sure enough my face got inflamed again (so I stopped). I only tried it because it got good reviews.  But as I have learned the hard way, that may because Kiehls.com censors its reviews and does not let them all go through.  I have tried several times to submit a review, being super-careful to stay within their guidelines.  Every time it is rejected, without explanation. MRC does get decent reviews here as well, but not as amazing as on the Kiehl&#x27;s website. In any case, I won&#x27;t be using their products any more, as the company seems a bit shady to me.</li>
    <li> I had beautiful skin in my teens and twenties. At around age 30 my skin went from \\&quot;normal\\&quot; to \\&quot;combination.\\&quot; I had near-constant breakouts, flaky and oily skin. I no longer felt pretty without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After feeling this way for a couple years and trying products from aveda, sephora, nordsrom and whole foods, I finally found this Holy Grail product (my other one is organic coconut oil). Within a week, my acne is cleared and skin texture and tone improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy. I will never stop buying this. I feel like me again! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;Nightly. First, cleanse with coconut oil. Rub coconut oil into skin, remove with hot wash cloth. Then use 6 drops of Midnight Recovery Concentrate on my face. (1 forehead, 1 chin, 2 per cheek).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simpler than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and far more effective!</li>
    <li> I know people rave about this stuff so I realize it will work for some and not for others. I must be in the category of other. It didn&#x27;t hurt my skin. It helped to give it moisture but beyond that, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try this and don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t let that discourage you though from trying out different Kiehl&#x27;s products. I love some of their other products (rare earth, microblur, cr&amp;egrave;me de corps are all tops in my book).</li>
    <li> I really liked the product and how it made my skin feel. I have used this with kiehls line reducing concentrate so the one star off as I don&#x27;t know how it works by itself.</li>
    <li> Okay okay...I might be the only one reviewing this recently that just was underwhelmed with this product. I say this reluctantly because I really want to like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews that people said they saw an immediate change. For me, no.&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews that people said when they miss a day of using it, they noticed. For me, not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; it, I wouldn&#x27;t say it was a great purchase. It does absorb insanely fast into my skin. And it does smell very nice. So I don&#x27;t know. I just wanted something that made my skin noticeably healthier and less dry. And I can&#x27;t truly say I&#x27;ve achieved either.</li>
    <li> And now I will buy this terrific Recovery Concentrate.  It is quickly absorbed, easily applied without leaving a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; appearance, and definitely makes fine lines less visible! I used it at bedtime, and in the morning before applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;It lasted throughout the day - another great Kiehl&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product: keeps skin near my eyes very soft and smooth in the morning, the only drawback is that it is bit pricey. Personally I think it is a good alternative to Estee Lauder and all the more expensive products.</li>
    <li> Best night serum I have used.  Keeps my skin hydrated and soft.  I would highly recommend to anyone.  I have been using for a few years now.  I can&#x27;t give it up; others do not compare.</li>
    <li> When I received a bottle of Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery, I was really skeptical on how good it could be.  I figured it probably would be like any other serum that you had to use with an additional moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery is a moisturizer that stands on it own.  You only need to use about 2-3 drops to cover your entire face.  It goes on like an oil, but it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, nor does it make you look like a buttery prawn when using it.  I have combination normal/dry skin that tends to not get moisturized enough on the dry spots, and break out on the normal spots on my face when using a new product.  I didn&#x27;t break out as much when I first started, and my dry spots were no longer looking dull.  Within a week of usage, my skin&#x27;s dry spots were gone and I didn&#x27;t have any other breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Midnight Recovery for about 2 months now, and I&#x27;m really happy at how soft my skin feels now.  My husband even noticed it without me asking him!  This is really a great product if you&#x27;re looking to get softer skin.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My skin was patchy, red, and swollen from winter wind. This helped soothe my skin instantly, and reduced redness overnight. It smells really nice too.&lt;br /&gt;It did not irritate my skin more and when/if you find the ingredient list you&#x27;ll see it does, in fact, contain lots of good natural skin boosters (like squalene and cucumber extract).</li>
    <li> Smells great, feels great on my skin.  I have only been using for 4 days but my skin already feels softer and looks better.</li>
    <li> This product made my skin break out.  It goes on very oily!&lt;br /&gt; Not sure it helped with fine lines.  Will not purchase again.  Sorry</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin look and feel great. I can tell when I forget to use it because my skin is a little duller the next day. I hope this product will always be available.</li>
    <li> My girlfriends,I have  four at this moment, say I have a baby skin. My  secret: Kiehl&#x27;s midnight recovery concentrate. It is great, make me handsome and hot</li>
    <li> I think those who are reviewing it as an oily product are using too much of it. You only need a pea size amount. A little of this goes a long way. I put this under my moisturizer and get incredible results. I have a tendency to be on the drier side so I use both. But this product can be used alone.</li>
    <li> A drop on each cheek after cleansing at night smooths over the lines and relaxes your skin for the night. Noticeably great feeling.</li>
    <li> A very nice light oil. Applies very nice. I am waiting to see the results! I use this specific serum when my skin is very dry.</li>
    <li> I wear it at night but its kind of oily and I worry that I may break out more so I only place it around non oily prone areas. Worked well around my eye area and cheeks!</li>
    <li> I purchased this concentrate in October after being given a sample at Kiehl&#x27;s duty free store in the Hong Kong airport.  As many with combination/sensitive skin are, I&#x27;m fairly rigid with my skin routine because new products tend to stress my skin out.  This goes double for oils (or serums), particularly after my grease-ball adolescence, haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this, the Midnight Recovery Concentrate has become a staple in my evening skincare routine.  There was no initial irritation, likely thanks to its natural and paraben-free ingredient list (according to the Kiehl&#x27;s product description).  A little goes a LONG way with this product, so you do feel better about spending the money since the bottle is quite big.  I apply about five drops total to my face, neck and decolletage each evening.  I&#x27;ve noticed significant improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and ability to retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MRC is additional a MUST for flights.  When I was given the sample, I was catching the 16 hour flight from Hong Kong to New York.  I applied twice on the plane and it worked wonders at keeping my skin hydrated against the typical dryness of dreaded airplane air.  Since the bottle is quite clunky for travel, I&#x27;ve subsequently purchased a little dropper (I wish Kiehl&#x27;s would stock some travel-sized packaging for its products!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be happily repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a week ago.  I love it.  I have combination skin that can be very oily and also with patch of rough &amp; dry skin.  Also I am always battling large pores and still at 30+ years old get an occasional blemish.  This product REALLY has helped balance out my skin, help old breakouts, even out my tone, and even my pores are looking smaller! I LOVE IT!  The best skin purchase I have made in years.  To be totally honest I have not yet seen a significant change in the smaller lines I get around the eyes and mouth but I would continue using this product even if I don&#x27;t ever see those results.</li>
    <li> Of course that is not exactly true, but I first found this product at Saks and then my Saks up and moved away....just when I had begun to love the feel of this oil at night and in the morning (just let it sink in a bit if you use it in the morning).  I think my wrinkles are less noticeable...but more importantly, my dry skin (including lips, under the nose and around the eyes) has disappeared. In the winter that is saying something special.  Use with the rosa artica cream for best results.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> I see a lot more from Dr Denese and her serum than this.  You need to put a lot on just to make sure it covers. Not worth the money</li>
    <li> I love Kiehl products and this is no exception the texture is smooth and it absorbs very quickly.  Thank you - five STARS.</li>
    <li> Like the smell. Apply less if you have a comparatively oily T zone.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin smooth and soft in the morning.</li>
    <li> but I love that smell.  Not for everyone but its for me!  smooth on your skins. Not too greasy!  Great as always from Kiehls</li>
    <li> Love!!! Leaves my face so smooth and soft. Although it&#x27;s an oil, it doesn&#x27;t make my face break out. I like it even better than the Bare Minerals Overnight Serum.</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin look and feel great. I can tell when I forget to use it because my skin is a little duller the next day. I hope this product will always be available. But it didn&#x27;t go with a box and I&#x27;m not sure it was sealed before deliver...so a little bit worry about qulity.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I finished up a sample and decided I needed the whole thing.  I have extraordinarily oily, blemish-prone, sensitive skin.  After one year of fighting acne (from coming off the pill) and trying to find the right products for my skin, I have found and stuck to a skin care regime that works for me.  I have tried pure rose hip oil and rms beauty oil, and both products broke me out terribly.  This facial oil has a beautiful, calming lavender scent and it makes my skin feel baby soft.  I use it for two nights in a row, then switch it out for Alpha H Liquid Gold for a night, then back to two nights of Midnight Recovery Concentrate, and so on.  When I wake up in the morning, my face appears brighter and more lively!  Love!</li>
