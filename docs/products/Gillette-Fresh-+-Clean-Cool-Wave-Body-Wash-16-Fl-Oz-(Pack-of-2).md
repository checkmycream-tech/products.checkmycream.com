      <li>It keeps him look and smell clean.</li>
      <li>Great product from Gillette that smells really good with a lasting fragrance and makes you feel so fresh and so clean all day long</li>
      <li>I have the cool wave after shave and deodorant and like them.  </li>
      <li>Visiting a friend in Houston, I was introduced to the Cool Wave Gillette body wash for men.  </li>
      <li>Husband loves the smell and the super clean feeling after a shower.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The subscribe and save price is actually quite a good deal but up until now I have been buying it in the store and using coupons.</li>
      <li>cool wave</li>
      <li>Cheap and worth it.</li>
      <li>So fresh a no so clean feeling</li>
      <li>Luckily, I found it on Amazon which sells 2 bottles packaged together.  </li>
      <li>When you get this stuff you are going to really like the strong clean smell.  </li>
      <li>Does not require more than a size of a quarter to later and finish without requiring more than you needed.</li>
      <li>nothing special but smells good, cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite men&#x27;s soap (not to greasy or hard to wash off &amp; smell is good).</li>
      <li>Builds a nice lather and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you still have soap left on you</li>
      <li>AND YOU SEEM TO STAY FRESH FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find it in the stores right now</li>
      <li>Gillette is always consistent.</li>
      <li>So, you better actually smell it before you buy it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend first applying it to a shower scrub or washcloth before you put it on your body to avoid this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a masculine clean scent but not overpowering or anything that has caused an allergic reaction to anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It becomes old and played out quick.</li>
      <li>This bottle is a pretty decent size and really easy to open in the shower.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my mate and it smells so good it is hard to keep my hands off of him</li>
      <li>It smells too much like a shaving product than a shower gel</li>
      <li>Some times there are local coupons to get this free with Gillette deoderant purchase.</li>
      <li>Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;m very upset that i can&#x27;t buy this product in stores anymore</li>
      <li>In additon the smell is not too loud either, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this .&lt;br</li>
      <li>Plus, the fragrance is very strong and certainly not my favorite.</li>
      <li>All the versions of their bodywash are pretty much the same, but they all work well.  </li>
      <li>I was not sure of other folks reviews raving about how great it smells</li>
      <li>Bottle design is easy to hold on to and durable as well as I knocked it down twice</li>
      <li>I subscribe to this and have used about 7 bottles so far!  </li>
      <li>You just feel clean after using this compared to other body washes.</li>
      <li>Lathers nicely on a loofah and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>axe, dove, and old spice).</li>
      <li>This is body only and doesn&#x27;t create nearly as much suds.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t go as far.</li>
      <li>One problem that I noticed, however, is that when you go to apply the gel to your wet hands or body it has a tendency to slide right off and onto the shower floor.  </li>
      <li>Small amount does the work, I will get some more in near future.</li>
      <li>Gillette Cool Wave drives me so crazy that my boyfriend says its better than giving me two shots of tequila.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> quite a odor blocker and i bought these at an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this .&lt;br /&gt;blocks odor for upto 2-3hrs.</li>
    <li> This has fake smell&amp;coloring,&amp; removes oils, but it does not good job of cleaning. Also the fragrance is very strong. I agree ingredients \\&quot;do not look good. I will worry about the toxicity of the residual detergent on my skin.\\&quot;  Also it it requires you use more of product .</li>
    <li> +Affordable price (with Subscribe and Save)&lt;br /&gt;+Good scent&lt;br /&gt;+Cleans well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through dozens of bodywashes and I always return to Gillette.  All the versions of their bodywash are pretty much the same, but they all work well.  Other bodywashes have had strange smells, left weird residues, or were just overpriced.  Gillette is always consistent.</li>
    <li> this is a great body wash and has a great price for it as you get a pack of 2. I would recommend this anyone.</li>
    <li> THIS BODY WASH IS GREAT FOR MY HUSBAND AND FOR ME.  NOT TOO HARSH FOR WOMEN AND YOU SEEM TO STAY FRESH FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME.  I ROTATE BETWEEN THIS BODY WASH AND DIAL AND LOVE THEM BOTH.....</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job, doesn&#x27;t look cheap, and made by a reputable company.  Not much else to say, other then recommendable if you want a product that seems to work.</li>
    <li> Visiting a friend in Houston, I was introduced to the Cool Wave Gillette body wash for men.  It has a fantastic scent and really lathers up nicely.  I was very disappointed to discover that no pharmacies in New York City carry Cool Wave (they carry other scents).  Luckily, I found it on Amazon which sells 2 bottles packaged together.  Perfect!  A++.</li>
    <li> it was inexpensive, which is why i bought it. i probably got a deal on it or something. i go in the shower smelling like B.O., and i leave not smelling so bad. removes dirt. it&#x27;s body wash, not a cure for male pattern baldness. worked as expected and  did not leave acid scars on my face.</li>
    <li> Husband loves the smell and the super clean feeling after a shower.  He is hooked on Gillette Body Wash for sure.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  It&#x27;s my favorite men&#x27;s soap (not to greasy or hard to wash off &amp; smell is good).</li>
    <li> Does the work that it says.&lt;br /&gt;Value for money&lt;br /&gt;Good foam and fragrance&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a few days now and i like it</li>
    <li> When you get this stuff you are going to really like the strong clean smell.  I was not sure of other folks reviews raving about how great it smells but I have to agree.  I used this at Lake Powell and it is great.  It can be used for an all over wash such as washing hair body etc and not having to take other stuff to the gym.  I subscribe to this and have used about 7 bottles so far!  Love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this on sale here ($4.94/2pack) in need of a good body wash.  This was great.  Makes a nice lather, doesn&#x27;t have any kind of oily feel to it, and smells great.  Bottle design is easy to hold on to and durable as well as I knocked it down twice and it didn&#x27;t crack but almost seemed to bounce.  Def. a great purchase when you can add the P&amp;G coupon.  Local store is running it \\&quot;on sale\\&quot; for $3.99 for 1 bottle.</li>
    <li> Gillette Cool Wave drives me so crazy that my boyfriend says its better than giving me two shots of tequila.  Can&#x27;t find it in the stores right now so had to stock up for the year online. Hope they bring it back!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance so he could have something that doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers or fruit when he visits me.  I LOVE the way it smells and it was a really great value considering you get two in this pack.  I would buy again :)</li>
    <li> Great product from Gillette that smells really good with a lasting fragrance and makes you feel so fresh and so clean all day long</li>
    <li> Awesome body wash, gets you clean, smells good and is cheap.  What more could you want?  I&#x27;d buy it again at the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I love the cool wave scent but this is not it.  My wife says it smells like disinfectant and I was thinking insecticide.  I have the cool wave after shave and deodorant and like them.  I had to throw this away.  The whole bathroom smelled after using it and not in a good way.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, works well and leaves you with a very fresh smell that lasts&lt;br /&gt;Like the fragrance so got the after shave and gel as well</li>
    <li> The smell too strong and cheap, Gillette this is for men and not for animals, smells like a pigs corral disinfectant.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s body wash, so there is not a ton to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice and it keeps you clean.  One problem that I noticed, however, is that when you go to apply the gel to your wet hands or body it has a tendency to slide right off and onto the shower floor.  I&#x27;d recommend first applying it to a shower scrub or washcloth before you put it on your body to avoid this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review was helpful!</li>
    <li> i like smelling nice and the girls that help me get showered every day all agree this smells very nice.</li>
    <li> Smells good &amp; has a great lather.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lasts long, I bought 2 of em, need to smell good. Gonna but more soon. Cheap and worth it.</li>
    <li> Really strong and fresh, but smells very familiar. It becomes old and played out quick. It smells too much like a shaving product than a shower gel</li>
    <li> I am happy using this product. I love the smell of it, it frshes me after each shower. Small amount does the work, I will get some more in near future.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He loves this body wash and I love the scene. It keeps him look and smell clean.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m very upset that i can&#x27;t buy this product in stores anymore and i can&#x27;t buy gillette invisible stick,cool wave either!i think i will look for another brand,not gillette!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bodywash... Too scented for me though.</li>
    <li> Great smelling, cheap and gets me really clean. I feel awake and refreshed every morning. I get so many compliments on the smell, everyone around me enjoys it. Lathers well, no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice and cheap. Smells good and lasts for an hour or so after the shower. Only negative  - leaves the skinny slightly dry - at least for me. But its a good soap to use and go liberal on the amount.</li>
    <li> lived up to expectations. nothing special but smells good, cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Does the job with a good later for scrubbing and a nice scent that is not too overpowering. I subscribe and save to this so it  arrives on my doorstep every couple of months. Pricing is comparable to a store, but this way I don&#x27;t have to remember to buy it.</li>
    <li> Very nice, manly scent, that lasts about 8 hours for me.  Lathers nicely on a loofah and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is a good price on Amazon.  We live in really hot weather so showering a few times a day is typical.  The body wash keeps my skin from drying out and the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.  Would buy again and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great Smell, not overpowering. Leaves no residue and weird after texture. Does not require more than a size of a quarter to later and finish without requiring more than you needed. You just feel clean after using this compared to other body washes.</li>
    <li> This bottle is a pretty decent size and really easy to open in the shower. The body wash smells great and the smell seems to last a bit longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who wants to smell better :)</li>
    <li> What is there to say.  This is soap, it smells good and I like it.  My girlfriend also likes the way it smells too.</li>
    <li> I ordered because I thought it was body and hair wash. Previous order was that and looked exactly the same. This is body only and doesn&#x27;t create nearly as much suds. Doesn&#x27;t go as far.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what is there not to like about these. They smell good, they do what they are advertised to do, cheaper than in store. I like them.</li>
    <li> I buy this regularly for my man and he likes it. The soap is not drying to the skin and works well. He also likes the smell to wake up to in the morning. It is a masculine clean scent but not overpowering or anything that has caused an allergic reaction to anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subscribe and save price is actually quite a good deal but up until now I have been buying it in the store and using coupons.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mate and it smells so good it is hard to keep my hands off of him, this is my perception of the smell, his perception of the effectiveness is also 5 stars, he gets very dirty in his job and is as clean as a baby when he gets out of the shower. I just ordered another package so it will be there when the first one runs out :)....In additon the smell is not too loud either, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> So fresh a no so clean feeling</li>
    <li> I have to say that I personally like this body wash the best from the others I have tried (axe, dove, and old spice). I think it smells great- the wife also likes how I smell after using it too. Builds a nice lather and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you still have soap left on you afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 pack is the best value for this product that I have found online. Some times there are local coupons to get this free with Gillette deoderant purchase.</li>
    <li> This body wash stick to your skin and it is very difficult to rinse it off. If you look at the composition, those chemicals do not look good. I will worry about the toxicity of the residual detergent on my skin. Plus, the fragrance is very strong and certainly not my favorite. To my mind it is good to cover bad bad odor but that is all. Maybe some people like it. So, you better actually smell it before you buy it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product--my husband does not like anything else. We have 2 bottles coming every 3 months so he does not have to run out.</li>
    <li> it will wash dirt off of your body and hands it smell good and doesn&#x27;t make me itchy after I use it</li>
