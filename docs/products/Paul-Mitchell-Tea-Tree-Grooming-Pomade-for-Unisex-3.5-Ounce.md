### Positive Reviews

      <li>It gives excellent shaping and hold but not the glossy shine that some others give that will leave your hair looking like it hasn&#x27;t been washed it 6 days.  </li>
      <li>Very happy with the product</li>
      <li>CT Beauty is awesome</li>
      <li>Non-greasy, smells real nice, and when it dries, it leaves no flakes at all or smudges on your clothes.</li>
      <li>the product is great but the seller posted 3.5 oz and when I received it, the container was 3.0 oz;</li>
      <li>But the product itself is great.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>

      <li>this stuff is cool, I&#x27;m happy i purchased this product, because other things I&#x27;ve used tend to cake up over time and this doesn&#x27;t</li>

      <li>love this product and so sad it isn&#x27;t really available anymore.</li>
      <li>will be buying more, not too oily and it does not make my hair feel hard.</li>
      <li>It was completely liquid as in water consistency.  </li>
      <li>but the current version has very little essence of tea tree more of a plastic smell.  </li>
      <li>Do not buy from this vendor as it is either old, not stored properly, or something else.</li>
      <li>The first one I bought came with a little carrying case.  </li>

    <li> I have been using this exclusively for the last 2-3 years.  It gives excellent shaping and hold but not the glossy shine that some others give that will leave your hair looking like it hasn&#x27;t been washed it 6 days.  It doesn&#x27;t have a smell either.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for more. My first experience was really positive with the product, but my second purchase and experience is just, okay. It could totally be me and my hair too. Give it a try, it may work for you. In a much smaller quantity i might suggest.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now, and I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it in the future. It smells amazing, and provides the necessary hold for styling my hair. I use an old-school barber, so I don&#x27;t ever make it in to the types of hairdressers/salons that carry this sort of product. Very pleased that it is on Amazon from saving me from having to go out of the way to pick it up.</li>
    <li> Love the pomade.  Use it all the time...it can be hard to find in the beauty supply stores, so I was glad to see it was available thru Amazon.  Thank you !!!</li>
    <li> It keeps my hair controlled during humid weather.  I would recommend it . I was disappointed that I did not receive the 3.5 oz. as described, but I did get my refund</li>
    <li> used this a while back but the current version has very little essence of tea tree more of a plastic smell.  i would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really like it! I am from the caribbean with natural hair and this really smoothes my edges. I like it a lot! will be buying more, not too oily and it does not make my hair feel hard.</li>
    <li> CT Beauty is awesome and I&#x27;m very happy with how long this stuff lasts as well as the relative discount you get form CT</li>
    <li> the product is great but the seller posted 3.5 oz and when I received it, the container was 3.0 oz;</li>
    <li> Product was literally soup.  It was completely liquid as in water consistency.  Amazon refunded me for it.  Do not buy from this vendor as it is either old, not stored properly, or something else.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product</li>
    <li> Works great during dry conditions. Has a flexible hold, but I gave it a 4 star rating as for when your hair gets even slightly wet it turns slimy and will lose its hold.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought came with a little carrying case.  I wish this one would have too.  Other than that, great purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used Paul Mitchell Tea tree product before and i was kind of happy. But this time i have tried this Grooming Pomade product and it&#x27;s big time sucks. It doesn&#x27;t smell good and its not even good for shaping my hair. It can&#x27;t hold my hairstyle more than 1 hr, which is really bad. In short i am not going to buy this again and i don&#x27;t recommend  this either to any one.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it&#x27;s sometimes hard to find locally. Thankfully I did find a shop locally that sells it - since this only price is sky high to expensive. But the product itself is great.</li>
    <li> I use this pomade for my beard; and it moisturizes and shapes as well.  It&#x27;s not greasy or oily, but it still manages to moisturize.  I really like the fragrance and the long-lasting (hours later)effects after application.</li>
    <li> been using this stuff for years, hard to find now though. good hold, true pomade soft hold, washes out, smell is great and not perfume-ie.</li>
    <li> I love this pomade. Love it so much I bought two of them at the same time. Non-greasy, smells real nice, and when it dries, it leaves no flakes at all or smudges on your clothes.</li>
    <li> this stuff is cool, I&#x27;m happy i purchased this product, because other things I&#x27;ve used tend to cake up over time and this doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> love this product and so sad it isn&#x27;t really available anymore.</li>
