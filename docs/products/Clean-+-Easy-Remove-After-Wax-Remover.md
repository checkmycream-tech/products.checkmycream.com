      <li>It works better than the stuff that was included in the kit.</li>

      <li>and I am glad I bought it.  </li>
      <li>the whole system is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a lotion..</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Despite it being mostly mineral oil with a fancy name</li>
      <li>Mostly mineral oil</li>
      <li>Safe and easy to use all over your body.</li>
      <li>Works great and makes your skin so soft!</li>
      <li>As far as removing wax residue from skin it works great.</li>
      <li>this works fine</li>
      <li>I just used this (Clean + Easy Remove</li>
      <li>This took the headache away and made clean up easy.</li>
      <li>Granted I don&#x27;t wax all the time, but you don&#x27;t need to apply much for it to be effective.</li>
      <li>so I can keep putting strips on my legs and smoothly ripping them off without getting too sticky.</li>
      <li>Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping!</li>
      <li>to be honest it isn&#x27;t any better than regular baby oil.  </li>
      <li>Right up my alley!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use scented soap right after waxing, it will irritate the pores you just ripped your hairs out of!</li>
      <li>It really cleanses my legs after waxing... &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to remove wax from my skin very well with this product.  </li>
      <li>Like the product name, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.</li>
      <li>It worked easily on the floor and pretty good on the counter, although I did have to use a little more effort on the counter.</li>
      <li>and it worked super well on that.</li>
      <li>It helps very much for what your needs are to get the job done!</li>
      <li>No matter how much I rub it against the area that has wax, it doesn&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
      <li>does the job, just needed more for an old kit</li>
      <li>It is worth the money.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have a big bottle of this.</li>
      <li>However, because it&#x27;s made with oil, it did seem to help calm my skin down after the waxing and make my legs feel very smooth after I washed it off!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Other than being slightly on the oily side, this is the best wax removing product I have found.  </li>
      <li>Gets rid of wax quickly  and is sensitive on my skin.</li>
      <li>I had to use it twice, mainly on my eyebrow area, but I followed another reviewer&#x27;s advice and hopped into the hot shower with it and found that worked well.</li>
      <li>that this remover was available in local shops so that i don&#x27;t have to pay so much for shipping.</li>
      <li>After applying the oil I gently rubbed off the wax with a damp towel.</li>
      <li>Is cheaper use a baby oil,because this product dont do much as baby oil don&#x27;t do.</li>
      <li>Yes, the product worked as it said it would and it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.  </li>
      <li>and you can get that much cheaper at a drugstore.</li>
      <li>i used this with Azulene Cream Rosin wax and it removed it very well.</li>
      <li>This stuff really dose help after waxing in removing the wax.</li>
      <li>I started doing them at home to save money and this stuff really worked.</li>
      <li>I tried it, But it really doesn&#x27;t help to get rid of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably through away that bottle since it really doesnt work as well.</li>
      <li>Perhaps I was expecting too much.</li>
      <li>This works really well to take the wax off.</li>
      <li>I do my own waxing and we all know how messy it can get.</li>
      <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
      <li>It seems  gentle on my sensitive skin,.and rinses off w/warm water.  </li>
      <li>I had completely forgotten that I bought this and kept finding wax pieces</li>
      <li>I simple massage it into my skin after waxing them take a shower and gently wash it off with unscented soap.</li>
      <li>At least with me, it gets better results when used in circular motion.</li>
      <li>Wax is messy and always a pain to clean up.  </li>
      <li>The second time I waxed went much smoother not only because of practice</li>
      <li>I wax my own eyebrows and sometimes (usually) I make a mess.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This smells descent, feels good when you put it on. Removes every bit of wax. Will definitely buy again and again.</li>
    <li> i got this liquid because wax that i had was not water soluble . this wax remover was very effective and removed wax very quickly . i would recommend it to everyone .&lt;br /&gt;i just felt that shipping was very expensive - almost cost of the product.&lt;br /&gt;wished that this remover was available in local shops so that i don&#x27;t have to pay so much for shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 8 years now, and it still works as great as the first day I tried it. I wax at home so it&#x27;s nice to have a big bottle of this. I simple massage it into my skin after waxing them take a shower and gently wash it off with unscented soap. Don&#x27;t use scented soap right after waxing, it will irritate the pores you just ripped your hairs out of! I also use it on my hands a little while I&#x27;m waxing because it helps to keep the wax off my hands so I can keep putting strips on my legs and smoothly ripping them off without getting too sticky.</li>
    <li> Maybe this would work for a soft wax, but it didn&#x27;t work for hard wax at all. It just made everything all oily. I didn&#x27;t like this at all and will be looking for something else.</li>
    <li> Used this after waxing my legs.  Wouldn&#x27;t remove the leftover wax fully.  I had to rub the wax off manually with my hands like you would a sticker stuck on a lighter.</li>
    <li> Despite it being mostly mineral oil with a fancy name it works well and I am glad I bought it.  Wax is messy and always a pain to clean up.  This took the headache away and made clean up easy.</li>
    <li> I needed a refill of this as I had run out. This bottle was so much bigger than I thought and will last me a long time. Very happy with product and price. Gets rid of wax quickly  and is sensitive on my skin. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Works so-so.  Not the best, not the worst.</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
    <li> Despite the mixed reviews, thought I&#x27;d give this a chance.  Its okay for the price, but to be honest it isn&#x27;t any better than regular baby oil.  I&#x27;ll go back to Parissa&#x27;s Azulene Oil.  A much better product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to remove wax from my skin very well with this product.  The blue oil works best for was removal.</li>
    <li> Performed as described.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for an after-waxing wax remover on the skin.  It is somewhat like baby oil and I just rub it on then jump in the shower and it removes all the wax; way better results with this than the wax remover lotion, which smells very nice but does do a very good job.  I will continue to buy and use this product on my legs.</li>
    <li> Other than being slightly on the oily side, this is the best wax removing product I have found.  Like the product name, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.</li>
    <li> This works really well to take the wax off. It is worth the money. It works better than the stuff that was included in the kit.</li>
    <li> Works great to remove the wax. You don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; to remove the wax.  Big bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different wax removers. I studied to do massage about 20 years ago and picked up waxing maybe 15 years later, but I only do it for friends... I seem to have a lot of friends. This is the best wax remover I have found. removes wax from skin and if careful it will remove wax from hair as well.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for men&#x27;s Brazilian waxing! It helps very much for what your needs are to get the job done!</li>

    <li> Works ok getting the wax off. Nothing spectacular.  Perhaps I was expecting too much. However, because it&#x27;s made with oil, it did seem to help calm my skin down after the waxing and make my legs feel very smooth after I washed it off!</li>
    <li> i used this with Azulene Cream Rosin wax and it removed it very well. It turned  what could have been a very sticky messy procedure into one that wasn&#x27;t so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem was lid wasn&#x27;t tight when I received it and it had leaked about a half an inch of it out into the plastic bag it was in.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove wax from skin, let alone surfaces. I let the oil soak on the droplets of wax while I scrubbed my legs raw, ended up using the hair dryer for the wax on the counter. I use honey wax.</li>
    <li> Works just like they say it will! Great for newbies cause wax can get everywhere and on everything.</li>
    <li> I used this product to get rid of the Gigi all purpose Honee Wax left on my skin after waxing. After applying the oil I gently rubbed off the wax with a damp towel. It also got rid of wax dropped on the tiles. It seems to be mineral oil (I&#x27;m not sure).</li>
    <li> It really cleanses my legs after waxing... &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It removes wax but I find coconut oil works better and is more moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Its good one, working and removing is ok. Used one time, so giving good. Will see how it will works.</li>
    <li> Yes, the product worked as it said it would and it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.  I would definitely recommend for others.</li>
    <li> You must have a bottle of this if you wish to maintain your sanity. Start no wax job without it unless you&#x27;re some kind of nut. You can thank me later.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how this helps me remove wax... No matter how much I rub it against the area that has wax, it doesn&#x27;t come off easily. It wipes off of my skin after couple minutes of rubbing, but any wax on my hair...expect it to stay on the hair unless I scrape it off with my finger nails.</li>
    <li> As far as removing wax residue from skin it works great. Haven&#x27;t used it for anything else.</li>
    <li> this stuff works best compatible with GIGI wax. It works the best in removing excess wax residue</li>
    <li> Not a substitute for azulene for wax removal. Mostly mineral oil and you can get that much cheaper at a drugstore.</li>
    <li> Great at removing wax. This is one of the best purchases I made since I went to waxing myself.</li>
    <li> The wax remover does what it should.  I will continue to buy when needed.</li>
    <li> The title says it all. It works, it&#x27;s far less pricey than other name brands. Right up my alley! I&#x27;ve used on hard and soft waxes, no problem.</li>
    <li> I bought a wax warmer/kit and a few extras including this wax remover. The first time I waxed at home was a mess (as to be expected)! I had completely forgotten that I bought this and kept finding wax pieces every where: the bottom of the shower, the bathroom floor, etc. I took this product to week old stuck on wax and it worked brilliantly. The second time I waxed went much smoother not only because of practice but because I remembered I had this stuff. It works great!</li>
    <li> Still takes a bit of scrubbing with the oil, but it does pretty much get the goo off, which really is difficult without it.</li>
    <li> does the job, just needed more for an old kit i was refreshing.  this works fine and I have 3 more words to add.</li>
    <li> This does a great job of removing wax wherever I use it.  It seems  gentle on my sensitive skin,.and rinses off w/warm water.  and you get  a lot for the price.</li>
    <li> I wax my own eyebrows and sometimes (usually) I make a mess. This is just what I needed. It cleans up the leftover wax on my skin and on my machine and sink.</li>
    <li> Is cheaper use a baby oil,because this product dont do much as baby oil don&#x27;t do.Never will buy again.Good luck.</li>
    <li> Love this product for wax removal! Works great and makes your skin so soft!</li>
    <li> This stuff really dose help after waxing in removing the wax. I started doing them at home to save money and this stuff really worked.</li>
    <li> The item is great the seller did a great job thank you</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. At least with me, it gets better results when used in circular motion.</li>
    <li> I do my own waxing and we all know how messy it can get. After my waxing I rub this oil in the sticky areas and scrub.. It effectively removes the wax. After I remove the wax I just wash off with soap and I&#x27;m done. I have the Gigi wax remover also. It&#x27;s more like a lotion.. I&#x27;ll probably through away that bottle since it really doesnt work as well.</li>
    <li> I just used this (Clean + Easy Remove After Wax Remover) after waxing my facial hairs with my GiGi All Purpose Honee wax kit. I must say it works WAY WAY WAY better than the GiGi Wax-Off. I had to use it twice, mainly on my eyebrow area, but I followed another reviewer&#x27;s advice and hopped into the hot shower with it and found that worked well. I also used it on a drip that hit my counter top and then the floor. It worked easily on the floor and pretty good on the counter, although I did have to use a little more effort on the counter. Then I cleaned the wax container and its lid and it worked super well on that. Really glad I tried this!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this stuff. It does a really good job of cleaning up the wax :)</li>
    <li> Product as described and I even use it after hard wax...get&#x27;s the skin-hangers off.</li>
    <li> Best was remover I&#x27;ve ever used.  the whole system is great.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great and easy to swipe on to remove wax.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a ok product, doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought so. 3 star from me</li>
    <li> This wax remover is brilliant. It works better than the wax removal wipes which come in the box with the wax. Safe and easy to use all over your body. I just rub it on, jump in the shower, and all residue is removed. Also this bottle is lasting me a really long time. Granted I don&#x27;t wax all the time, but you don&#x27;t need to apply much for it to be effective. Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Good smell and good results!</li>
    <li> I tried it, But it really doesn&#x27;t help to get rid of wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will try this again</li>
