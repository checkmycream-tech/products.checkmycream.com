<ol>
      <li>I give it five stars because it gets all the hairs (even the ones you can&#x27;t see) and it&#x27;s a great way to save money on trips to the salon for a wax or to pay to get it threaded!</li>

      <li>Sometimes pinches skin, but will not if skin is taut and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love this product so much!</li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to take off completely of my hairs yet</li>

      <li>Some of that is probably me not doing the technique right, but it&#x27;s something you should know.</li>
      <li>It arrived in a decent time frame, great for getting those unwanted hairs off your face and its just a cool little contraption.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the easiest and most convenient way to remove facial hair.</li>

      <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt much but rather wax or pluck.</li>
      <li>At first it hurts, but after going over your hairs a few times its not bad.</li>
      <li>Overall, i really like this!</li>
      <li>Works exactly like how it&#x27;s supposed to, but does not grab very short hairs.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off buying wax, I recommend buying GiGi hard brazilian wax (with its warmer), I have it</li>
      <li>This tool barely pulls anything out.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected.</li>
<li> If hair is too dry, it will break hair.  </li>
<li> I feel maybe the springs are to loose</li>
<li> Got to give it a thumbs down to remove hair above lip.</li>
<li> i tryed it the other day and it did pull out alot of little almost invisible hair off my face which is great because i freakin hate waxing so all in all</li>
<li> Can be hard on palms/wrists if working on a large area or if coil keeps missing hairs.  </li>
<li> It works but not worth it.</li>
<li> I am middle eastern and we have thick hair</li>
<li> I do feel a little pain</li>
<li> Works well, just takes a little practice.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
<li> It does pull facial hair out but some hairs are broken off instead of pulling from the root.</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure I am using correctly.  </li>
<li> I am disappointed at this product, it took very long to be delivered and now that it has finally been delivered, it doesn&#x27;t work .</li>
<li> Its too hard to use</li>
<li> it&#x27;s really painful if you have sensitive skin</li>
<li> It plucks out a few hairs difficult to do hard to reach area like chin.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s hard to maneuver and awkward to hold.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m bored at anytime of the day</li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> no need to buy an expensive one!</li>
<li> You could be turning it the wrong way!</li>
<li> Painful.  </li>
<li> and I just hate it.</li>
<li> works well to remove hair but very painful</li>

<ol>
    <li> It arrived in a decent time frame, great for getting those unwanted hairs off your face and its just a cool little contraption. Works well. I like it!</li>
    <li> Hurts a bit when I started using it, but it&#x27;s better than waxing and way cheaper. Love it! Recommand buying it.</li>
    <li> works well to remove hair but very painful</li>
    <li> Does not work at all I had used other threading tools that were great I feel maybe the springs are to loose</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected. And it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs like I would expect. Maybe I&#x27;m just still learning...???... Idk.</li>
    <li> it does the job kind of. you just have to get used to the motion and the pain. it&#x27;s really painful if you have sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Painful.  Received without instructions or packaging so I&#x27;m not sure I am using correctly.  Got to give it a thumbs down to remove hair above lip.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like how it&#x27;s supposed to, but does not grab very short hairs.  Sometimes pinches skin, but will not if skin is taut and smooth.  If hair is too dry, it will break hair.  Takes practice to pull out hairs in specific spots that coil may miss.  Can be hard on palms/wrists if working on a large area or if coil keeps missing hairs.  Beats using tweezers for individual hairs though.</li>
    <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
    <li> i tryed it the other day and it did pull out alot of little almost invisible hair off my face which is great because i freakin hate waxing so all in all it was a great buy</li>
    <li> I just dont like this item. Its too hard to use and I just hate it. Sorry. It might work better for someone else.</li>
    <li> This product isnt perfect but it does a  good job when used right. It does pull facial hair out but some hairs are broken off instead of pulling from the root. Great product to have on hand. Does a better job than using creams or waxing.</li>
    <li> I like this beauty tool! Though, i&#x27;m still a beginner at using this. I haven&#x27;t been able to take off completely of my hairs yet but it does it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;ll take some practice to get used to. What I don&#x27;t like is the pain of taking the facial hairs off but beauty is pain right? Overall, i really like this! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> It works but not worth it. Removed some hair but it&#x27;s hard to maneuver and awkward to hold. Doesn&#x27;t hurt much but rather wax or pluck.</li>
    <li> works great! no need to buy an expensive one! just need to know how to use it. the coil is way more flexible than i expected :) love this</li>
    <li> Omg I lub dis a lot.  I am a girl wit Potts hair on my upper lip. So dis thing same meh, no one saysheet to me the anymore. it so the good materials.</li>
    <li> They should call this thing a fur ripper.  It does remove hair, but yow!  Plus, it pulls without removing a lot of the time.  Some of that is probably me not doing the technique right, but it&#x27;s something you should know.</li>
    <li> Works well, just takes a little practice.</li>
    <li> This item will cut the hair and not pull it from the root. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed at this product, it took very long to be delivered and now that it has finally been delivered, it doesn&#x27;t work . I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This tool barely pulls anything out. I do feel a little pain so it means it&#x27;s pulling something out, it just doesn&#x27;t even do 50% of its job, because I still see the facial hair. You&#x27;re better off buying wax, I recommend buying GiGi hard brazilian wax (with its warmer), I have it and it works great.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! It&#x27;s the easiest and most convenient way to remove facial hair. I give it five stars because it gets all the hairs (even the ones you can&#x27;t see) and it&#x27;s a great way to save money on trips to the salon for a wax or to pay to get it threaded! At first it hurts, but after going over your hairs a few times its not bad. I definitely recommend this product to everyone who is looking for an easy way to get rid of unwanted hairs at home :)</li>
    <li> I love this so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m bored at anytime of the day and I end up looking at my face, I always use this to get rid of the facial hair I have.</li>
    <li> This does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I had to look up how to properly use it on the internet, but once I did, it was pretty easy. This is meant more for the finer hairs on your face. Not so much eyebrows or anything. I would imagine if you had upper lip hair or along the jaw line this would work well.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it pulls the hair sometimes it cuts</li>
    <li> Did not arrive with instructions.</li>
    <li> Works great! Everyone should have one of these! Tip: If it&#x27;s not working for you, check out some videos on YouTube for assistance. You could be turning it the wrong way!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. It doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!</li>
    <li> This product does not do what it is meant to do. I am middle eastern and we have thick hair so I thought this would work perfect, but it did not. It plucks out a few hairs difficult to do hard to reach area like chin. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice and cheaper than buying wax</li>
