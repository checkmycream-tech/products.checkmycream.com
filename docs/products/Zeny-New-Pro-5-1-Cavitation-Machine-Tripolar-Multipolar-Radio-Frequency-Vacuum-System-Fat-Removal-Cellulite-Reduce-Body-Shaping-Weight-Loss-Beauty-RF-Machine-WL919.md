      <li>This amazing  machine has covered all my expectations and beyond</li>

      <li>I love love love this machine!</li>
      <li>Great Product and very responsible seller.</li>
      <li>so glad I invested in this machine.  </li>
      <li>I want my face &amp; neck better, before I start my arm, legs, or tummy.  </li>
      <li>Not because the machine does not work, but because the skilled technician is still required for the application.  </li>
      <li>Much better than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>and I have recieved nothing more .</li>
      <li>We have been using it only for a month, and see wonderful results.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love the results on my face.  </li>
      <li>(and probably with a better machine.)  </li>
      <li>My neck is looking better.  </li>
      <li>I like it, I love it......</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better to buy it yourself than pay $60-80 per session for 8 sessions or more.  </li>
      <li>Great product, very efective.</li>
      <li>I need a lot more treatments, not were</li>
      <li>Love the machine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The greatest impact to me &amp; where I have spent most time is on my joints; having osteo - on an elbow with tendonitis and on my feet (one having a fallen arch).  </li>
      <li>some of those should be taken with a grain of salt, but there is a lot out there if you want to get more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to use, but I do wish a booklet came with it from the manufacturer, instead of the one that you get.  </li>
      <li>The hook-up was easy because it has number of holes for inserts</li>
      <li>Painless and easy use</li>
      <li>and it works and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The machine seems well made and is easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First of all I would like to mention the amazing customer service I&#x27;ve received from this seller.</li>
      <li>The machine may be fine...</li>
      <li>Now everything is fine.</li>
      <li>I tried to fine some help to my problem , but all I get is it is made in China</li>
      <li>I was very excited to get this product so quickly.</li>
      <li>It says from a USA supplier, but actually the equipment is from China; which I was not too happy about it.</li>
      <li>Being 55, this was important to me.  </li>
      <li>So far, I am very pleased.  </li>
      <li>I love that I am able to do so many different types of treatments with one machine</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>I am trying to use it on an almost daily basis with shorter durations &amp; it is successful.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;polar&amp;#34; heads get really hot, but you can adjust the intensity and/or put on more ultrasound gel.  </li>
      <li>The return process was not painful</li>
      <li>But it requires many treatments as you have to learn how much power to apply.  </li>
      <li>Too strong of setting  and improper use can lead to fat atrophy in the face, something no one wants!.  </li>
      <li>truly feel this was a worthy investment.</li>
      <li>The older you are the more treatments needed.</li>
      <li>Love being able to use the machine though I need proper operating procedures which isnt in the booklet</li>
      <li>This machine is very easy to use and the directions are clear.</li>
      <li>The vacuum is fairly strong and i wonder if it might be more damaging than beneficial.  </li>
      <li>It works but you need to be patient, worth the price.</li>
      <li>With my own machine, I can do as big an area as I want.</li>
      <li>I think I am well on my way to getting my money&#x27;s worth for this machine using this pricing as comparison.  </li>
      <li>I spent a good bit of time trying to research how to use it but still couldn&#x27;t find much instruction.</li>
      <li>The seller quickly replied With respect to the machine: it works very well, the result I noticed the first time on the face and stomach.</li>
      <li>I am willing to try this to reduce fat around my waist, arms and legs.</li>
      <li>and I could &amp;#34;FEEL&amp;#34; the change in the elbow immediately - first time---whoo hoo - Who would have thought?  </li>
      <li>I love that there are hand pieces to tighten the skin not only on my body, but on my face and neck, and around the eyes.  </li>
      <li>First thing -</li>
      <li>It was pretty gratifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;you can use the four-polar handle first to lift skin, then use tripolar handle for skin rejuvenation&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>if you could figure out how to use it properly and safely.  </li>
      <li>It was definitely worth the investment to know and a reasonable alternative to the $4000 real thing at the office.  </li>
      <li>Overall,  it seems to be working fine.</li>
      <li>This machine is so reliable, I have never even so much as had a fuse blow out.</li>
      <li>Clothes are getting much looser.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I see the promising results after using for a week.</li>
      <li>The vacuum unit did not have any more suction and the ultrasound reads made the noise but no other effects.</li>
      <li>So I quite hurting; get more active because no pain plus the weight is dropping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>how vibrant my face was &amp;</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this machine to anyone looking to loss inches off their waist.</li>
      <li>Complete nonsense!!</li>
      <li>The professional told me I should not expect to see any real difference until after about 6-8 sessions.  </li>
      <li>My feeling is that this is a powerful enough of a machine that you need to take measures to protect yourself.  </li>
      <li>It was not hard at all to assemble.  </li>
      <li>Exercising and eating right, will only enhance your results.  </li>
      <li>The sensation from the cavitation was exactly the same.</li>
      <li>A+ professional looking product and seems so well-built.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> simply amazing am still learning all the  aspects of the machine and how to get the best results</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product so quickly. Unfortunately, the instructions aren&#x27;t good. I spent a good bit of time trying to research how to use it but still couldn&#x27;t find much instruction. Also, on the second use, the screen became completely distorted and I can hardly see what buttons I am pushing. It says to call if there is any trouble while useing but there is zero contact information and no return information. I&#x27;m disappointed and am hoping to find a way to get this device replaced or returned.</li>
    <li> I like it, I love it......works great!!</li>
    <li> It came with a very small user&#x27;s giude and after using for a very short time doesn&#x27;t turn on at the fisrt try I have to press the bottom twice or even 3 times to get it to work.</li>
    <li> It works but you need to be patient, worth the price.</li>
    <li> The machine may be fine...if you could figure out how to use it properly and safely.  The instructions for use do not cover enough if formation on the &amp;#34;MODE SETTINGS FOR CAVITATION- AND DO NOT COVER THE PROPER INTENSITY SETTINGS FOR USE WITH ANY OF THE HAND HELD WANDS.  When it comes to your body and face you should not guess if you are using this equipment properly.  I have ask...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.  How do you know what settings to put the machine on to achieve effectiveness and not damage your skin.  Too strong of setting  and improper use can lead to fat atrophy in the face, something no one wants!.  There is no real/proper instructions for the actual control settings for use of any of the 5 hand devices on this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This question (WHAT SETTINGS TO USE)  seems to be inadvertently unanswered when ask.  I receive the same response...&amp;#34;you can use the four-polar handle first to lift skin, then use tripolar handle for skin rejuvenation&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love the machine. I have had it for a few weeks and have used the different components for a number of body parts multiple times. Seeing improvement but I have had treatments done at the spa and they say that it takes a minimum of 10 treatments to see results. The machine is very similar to machines that have been used on me at saloons. My cleaning man thought that I paid thousands of dollars for machine because of the appearance of it</li>
    <li> Great Product and very responsible seller. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> Buy this team for months I recommend 100% had comtratiempo but were solved, their salespeople answered all my questions, thank you very much, my patients are happy with the results and happy about my purchase I am cosmetologa I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> Excelent!!! I received it before to the expectation day.</li>
    <li> A very good machine,working fast if you continue the procedure</li>
    <li> I have been using this for just over a week.  So far, I am very pleased.  The machine seems well made and is easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started doing cavitation with a professional  - so far 4 sessions costing $60 each for 20 minutes.  I think I am well on my way to getting my money&#x27;s worth for this machine using this pricing as comparison.  The cavitaion head gives me about the same sensation as the professional&#x27;s machine.  I am using it for cellulite and it is slow going.  The professional told me I should not expect to see any real difference until after about 6-8 sessions.  Plus she will only do a small area at a time.  With my own machine, I can do as big an area as I want. You should wait at least 3 days in between treatments to let the fat clear and your body recover (drink A LOT of water), so it will still be slow - just not glacial. Plus I don&#x27;t have to drive 25 minutes to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started using the other heads on various areas and so far I saw some immediate results on my face.  It was pretty gratifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people complained that there were no instructions with their machines.  Mine did come with an instruction booklet - albeit badly translated to English, but not so bad that you do not get the idea.  I have also checked out some youtube videos.  Seems like some of those should be taken with a grain of salt, but there is a lot out there if you want to get more comfortable.  My feeling is that this is a powerful enough of a machine that you need to take measures to protect yourself.  The &amp;#34;polar&amp;#34; heads get really hot, but you can adjust the intensity and/or put on more ultrasound gel.  The vacuum is fairly strong and i wonder if it might be more damaging than beneficial.  Seems to me pulling skin so hard is not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I eventually get the results I want for my cellulite, I will give it another star.</li>
    <li> Terrible directions poorly  translated from Chinese.  Not one word about the machine, which came with fuses but I have no idea where they go.</li>
    <li> i just received the Zeny machine yesterday and used it.  It was not hard at all to assemble.  The hook-up was easy because it has number of holes for inserts so you can&#x27;t go wrong.  It&#x27;s just hard to do it yourself for 30 minutes.  I have to get my kids to do my back.  I bought the thersonic blue color gel and it worked well.  I started with low level first to make sure i don&#x27;t burn myself but the rf body is a little hard on the ear but you feel the vibration.  I know ultrasound can also be used for therapeutic on ankle sprain and pain so this Zeny will be used for lots of things.  I just hope it will last longer.  It&#x27;s better to buy it yourself than pay $60-80 per session for 8 sessions or more.  I am willing to try this to reduce fat around my waist, arms and legs.</li>
    <li> They followed up and have me instructions it&#x27;s great now.Love being able to use the machine though I need proper operating procedures which isnt in the booklet and I have recieved nothing more . Giving 1 star because of the lack of directions for usage.. If I had those it would be 5 stars</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month now .dont see any  results .</li>
    <li> Great product, very efective.</li>
    <li> First of all I would like to mention the amazing customer service I&#x27;ve received from this seller. I&#x27;ve used the machine once on the face where I noticed a glowing appearance the following day and once on the upper leg and the verdict is still out on that. I know that is required a few sessions in order to see a change. I don&#x27;t regret buying it and I thing it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I love the results on my face.  My neck is looking better.  I need a lot more treatments, not were I want to be yet.  I want my face &amp; neck better, before I start my arm, legs, or tummy.  The verdict is still out on the body or inches off.  The older you are the more treatments needed.</li>
    <li> I like the product. The machine works as described. I see the promising results after using for a week. However, I found that the Cavitation is little bit noise in the ears.</li>
    <li> Too painful to use vacuum, but except vacuum, it is great</li>
    <li> Did not work correctly.  However the manufacturer did honor the return within reason.</li>
    <li> It stopped working almost immediately so we not evaluate it&#x27;s effectiveness. It is supposed to have a warranty, but it&#x27;s been impossible to get actionable feedback thus far. Company will not fix it. Be wary. Technology questions aside, a machine that can&#x27;t turn on is useless (and yes it was this model).</li>
    <li> I have not seen ANY results after I tried different heads as recommended. The manual is rather poor in details and background. There is no explanation why to use different heads, what the expected effect are etc. After 2 weeks the device stopped functioning. The vacuum unit did not have any more suction and the ultrasound reads made the noise but no other effects. I returned it. The return process was not painful so I am grateful for that</li>
    <li> We have been using it only for a month, and see wonderful results. Highly recommend this machine to anyone looking to loss inches off their waist.</li>
    <li> I have not yet received my machine. I read a lot of reviews where the directions were not included so I emailed to receive my directions before my machine came. There is a website that has a phone number and the guy will tell you everything in detail. It is a Michigan phone number so you can call from the USA. He talked to me in great detail about each of the heads and what to use them for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zeny.us is th website tge phone number ia on there</li>
    <li> I don´t want to give a definitive review,  but I am very happy so far. I have been using it for three weeks so far, have reduced 2 inches in my waist and 1 inch in my hips. The cellulite is slowly but surely dissapearing. I Have been using the Ultracavi on max for 30 min., then the radiofrecuency on max. for 30 min. and then I do  a 30 min. workout. You need to drink a lot of water and you are not supposed to eat fat for a day or two after the treatment.  I will be updating my review. You are supposed to do 8-12 sessions to see good results.</li>
    <li> This machine was a terrible waste of money and time.. After a few uses, the laser went dead, the vacuum stopped working.  The laser would work for 5 seconds, then shut off.  The number started scrambling, it was just a mess.</li>
    <li> It says from a USA supplier, but actually the equipment is from China; which I was not too happy about it. If I knew that, I could have bought the same machine cheaper from EBay.  I thought this machine would have a choice to select on the menu/screen different parts of the body like: abdomen, arms, legs, which it doesn&#x27;t. I saw this feature on other cavitation machines.&lt;br /&gt;The operating manual is poor written, I downloaded info from other sources I&#x27;m order to understand the equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Also there is a lose screw inside of the machine, which I hope its just an extra screw. I see it but I can&#x27;t remove it unless I open the equipment, which would void the warranty. And I don&#x27;t feel returning it to the supplier, going to the hassle of repacking and so on. Overall,  it seems to be working fine.</li>
    <li> I have completed 3 treatments so far and I have noticed a difference especially where my stubborn fat deposits are. You definitely have to drink a lot of water and use a lot of the Ultrasound gel</li>
    <li> I have a problem that it shuts down , before the timer is done .  I tried to fine some help to my problem , but all I get is it is made in China an no one here can help ......  if you can find me a contact to answer my Questions here in the states it would be a BIG help.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been working on this machine , I&#x27;m very happy. I had a problem that I weakly connected the hose, I thought that Vacuum not working .. But when I asked the seller, it explained everything Now everything is fine. The seller quickly replied With respect to the machine: it works very well, the result I noticed the first time on the face and stomach. Painless and easy use</li>
    <li> still in the process to see results will update!</li>
    <li> De cavitacion stopped working after a week...</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying.  First thing - The machine works.  It does.  I agree that the directions are absent.  So to google for what to do.&lt;br /&gt;But it works.  The problem is that it becomes hard to do it yourself because there is no way to know when an area is done.  Picture having the&lt;br /&gt;machine the doctor uses but you do not have the skill to use it effectively.  If you are a medical tech in a dermatology office, then this will work for you.  If you are just someone at home attempting to replicate what was done at the doctor&#x27;s office, then this will not work for you.  Not because the machine does not work, but because the skilled technician is still required for the application.  I coupled this with the &amp;#34;L&#x27;eudine Redugel Excessive Body Fat Burner Reducer&amp;#34; Gel mixed with ultrasonic gel at 5:1 ratio.  It works and smells great with good after effect.  Reduced the cellulite and facial wrinkles well.  But it requires many treatments as you have to learn how much power to apply.  I stay at level 6 at this point and does what I need it to do.  My suggestion if you want this is to pay someone on the side (like a massage therapist) to apply the treatments to you using this machine.  It is the best way to get the results.  People will find great results if they add this to their repertoire of in-home, specialized services (massage, acupuncture, etc).  Absolute best for couples when one of them is in this line of work.  I love it and it works and is easy to use.  It was definitely worth the investment to know and a reasonable alternative to the $4000 real thing at the office.  But it is not as good as the doctor&#x27;s office where a skilled technician applies the procedure. (and probably with a better machine.)  There are other machines out there that tell you when an area is done.  They use heat sensors and lights to tell you when an area is treated.  But that is twice the price.... go figure.....  you gots to pay for the knowledge.  Good luck people.</li>
    <li> The timer occasionally does not work</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but decided to invest in my own machine, instead of going for skin tightening and cavitation treatments at local spas and medical clinics and spending a ton of money.  I figured, I could always send it back, if I didn’t like it.  When it arrived, I was surprised to find that it is as big, and of the same quality, as the machines used at the places I’ve gone for prior treatments.  It is easy to use, but I do wish a booklet came with it from the manufacturer, instead of the one that you get.  I love that I am able to do so many different types of treatments with one machine and I can adjust the level of intensity for my own comfort.  I have been using it for almost two weeks.  Cavitation shouldn’t be done daily on any one body part, as it takes time for the fat cells to be flushed out after a treatment (72 hours), so I do a different part of my body daily, and drink a ton of water!!!  I love that there are hand pieces to tighten the skin not only on my body, but on my face and neck, and around the eyes.  Being 55, this was important to me.  Have I noticed a difference?  Yes.  I can honestly say, I have noticed a difference already.  I’m so glad I invested in this machine.  Just remember, if you are going to invest your money in buying this machine, you must also invest your time and use it.  Exercising and eating right, will only enhance your results.  And don’t forget to order a supply of the ultrasound gel!</li>
    <li> Same machine from the spa I went too after paying for 4 sessions! It&#x27;s bigger in person, you will need a separate table to sit it on. Other than that it works just like theirs did in the salon. The sensation from the cavitation was exactly the same. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Well made and works great.  The instruction manual is entertainment gold but I have been having treatments done at a spa so I know how the heads work.  Much better than I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I love love love this machine! I am a Licensed Cosmetologist in all fields of practice. I use this machine in my salon every single day. My clients are getting great results. This machine is so reliable, I have never even so much as had a fuse blow out. I call her old faithful. I have had other brand machines that I have had break down and had to return. I can always count on this machine when others  higher priced machines have failed me. This machine is very easy to use and the directions are clear. I have had great customer service from this seller and I will continue to use this brand machine and this seller for all of my salon needs. If you are looking for results for yourself or your clients I promise you this is the machine to purchase and put your trust in!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Zeny.  It is difficult to leave a comment in the first two weeks of owning it due to the 72 hr time spans for the body to eliminate wastage.  However, with guidance from the representative and some questions this is what has happened to me.  I am trying to use it on an almost daily basis with shorter durations &amp; it is successful.  I swore within 10 minutes of using it on my face I saw a difference.  I saw an old friend yesterday &amp; she told me several times how vibrant my face was &amp; she could see a difference (to that point &amp; had used 2 times on face/neck.  I have only used it on my abdomen 1 time and found I had expelled a very unexpected 5 pounds.  Granted I am overweight, however, was shocked.  Clothes are getting much looser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest impact to me &amp; where I have spent most time is on my joints; having osteo - on an elbow with tendonitis and on my feet (one having a fallen arch).  It is helping my developing arthritis in my hands/fingers.  On the elbow, I know the nerve runs under the arm (&amp; I was simply trying to get the flapping pits to stop waving - but was running the cavitation head down to elbow and I could &amp;#34;FEEL&amp;#34; the change in the elbow immediately - first time---whoo hoo - Who would have thought?  So of course, instead of contouring (except for double chin, haha) I seem pulled to getting rid of painful areas that normally I would see a masseuse or chiro for if bad enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear that either one of two things are happening:  I believe it is breaking up the fascia w/RF waves &amp; the cavitation OR, because I have had bone spurs &amp; surgeries 3 times for this in shoulder, I think I make calcium and that is part of the osteo in fingers.  Autoimmune &amp; all of that - however those waves &amp; cavitation are emphatically improving that.  My sister had ultrasonic radio waves in water to break up scar tissue from a bad carpal tunnel surgery and this was using sound waves in the same way.  JUST MAKES SENSE.  So I quite hurting; get more active because no pain plus the weight is dropping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly feel this was a worthy investment. and this company really stands behind this product, because I contacted them both by e-mail and phone when I thought something was wrong with the vacuum (it was me), but heck I did learn this would help with tender joints when I spoke with  the company representative.  A+ professional looking product and seems so well-built.  Looks like I should be paying for visits to someone else, but I get the professionalism, privacy and comfort of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I am 66 years old; just retired and I am happy to support an excellent product that is giving me so much.  I receive no more than direction in usage of the equipment from the company.  They seem to have high ideals and integrity from my personal experience.</li>
    <li> Excellent acquisition. This amazing  machine has covered all my expectations and beyond</li>
    <li> There are no instructions on how to actually use the machine. The manual only explains how the machine works on the cells. I did one treatment and the vacuum is very painful! There are no instructions on how to use it so knowing which option you should use first is impossible.  I bought this machine for cellulite problem areas. I see no difference at all! The machine comes with a bunch of part with no explanation of what they are for or where they go! Horrible!! I am waiting on an answer to return the machine! I hope I don&#x27;t have to take this company to court for my return!! Complete nonsense!!</li>
