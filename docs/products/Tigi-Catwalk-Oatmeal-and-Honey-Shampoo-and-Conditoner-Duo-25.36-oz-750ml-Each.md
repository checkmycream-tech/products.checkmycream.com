      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s not my favorite</li>
      <li>but I love this scent more than any of theirs.  </li>
      <li>smell is okay</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always leery about buying product online without being able to see it</li>
      <li>Love the product and the customer service.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff....</li>
      <li>I was very happy when I saw I could buy on-line, however, when I received it and opened it up, the bottles had leaked open and was all over the place!  </li>
      <li>I like the shampoo better than the conditioner</li>
      <li>want more but can&#x27;t find it anywhere...........</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love the product because my sister does</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I could find it on Amazon</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I might try a moisturizer from this brand, which I love.</li>
      <li>I knew that there had to be a better way, so I started searching.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo for a decent price.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very sweet and honey-ish</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product and will be ordering more very soon</li>
      <li>Fortunately they were packaged in a plastic bag so it did not get all over the inside of the box or on the DVD they were packaged with.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells so yummy and leaves your hair soft and smelling good.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair look really good but its not the same shampoo I fell in love with.</li>
      <li>Be aware that this is not the lovely original formula of Oatmeal and Honey.  </li>
      <li>The scent is off and in no way makes my hair smell like delicious oatmeal cookies, like the old blue packaging did.  </li>
      <li>One of the shampoo bottles is also leaking, but I haven&#x27;t removed that from the plastic bag yet to clean it</li>
      <li>my hair and scalp felt so clean after</li>
      <li>It feels great on my dry, curly hair too.</li>
      <li>The smell is AMAZING, definitely the most under rated Tigi product out there</li>
      <li>Other reviewers don&#x27;t like the smell, but honestly it couldn&#x27;t get any better unless it smelled like a pumpkin spice latte.</li>
      <li>My hair was severly damaged by a coloring process, and this is the only product I have found that makes it at all manageable, and leaves it looking shiny and healthy!</li>
      <li>I miss the old formula that left my hair feeling and smelling great...</li>
      <li>Thank goodness I was able to find the product available through a private seller on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This shampoo &amp; conditioner pack is simply divine and smells like fall baked goods, it was so fitting that it arrived on the first day of fall!</li>
      <li>, I can guarantee the top ingredients will me the same.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time in the shower today</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find it any more in stores locally</li>
      <li>So glad they brought this back.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping from this seller!</li>
      <li>/smell it first, but I took a chance.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is what really is helping my fried out hair.</li>
      <li>It works really well for my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I am so pleased with this shampoo and conditioner and the added price (it&#x27;s about double what my old go-tos were)</li>
      <li>Other people have been complimenting my hair more as well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine, long, and curly.</li>
      <li>At first I loved it, but recently my hair had been a bit drier than usual.</li>
      <li>This is a great hair product, always has been, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t packaged very well.</li>
      <li>I would love it even more if it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise I received the product much quicker than expected, it smells FANTASTIC and makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>My hair became less frizzy, more manageable, and much shinier shortly after I switched to this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have really fine but dense hair, so anything weighs it down</li>
      <li>or it was very old.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>It is color safe and I just had my hair done a few days ago and noticed that my color looked brighter!</li>
      <li>works well, but this isn&#x27;t the old formula, and it&#x27;s noticeable.  </li>
      <li>Another thing I am thrilled about is that you can use very, very small amounts with big, big results … lots of lather.  </li>
      <li>My sister in law uses it on hair full, thin, straight hair and loves it.</li>
      <li>and since they were shaken from side to side during delivery the top was being pushed down and a few tablespoons</li>
      <li>Hair becomes soft, no fly aways and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>I got this shampoo hoping it will help with my thick hair, instead made it more frizzy, also the smell is more like a rancid honey, the shampoo is thick but the conditioner isnt and you have to use a lot in order to half work, it was a pure waste of my money!</li>
      <li>Bought these as per my sister&#x27;s recommendation but I paid a WHOLE lot LESS than what she paid at the salon.  </li>
      <li>All of the products were shipped in a large flat box, laying down.  </li>

    <li> I got this shampoo hoping it will help with my thick hair, instead made it more frizzy, also the smell is more like a rancid honey, the shampoo is thick but the conditioner isnt and you have to use a lot in order to half work, it was a pure waste of my money!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year. At first I loved it, but recently my hair had been a bit drier than usual. No changes from my part. I might try a moisturizer from this brand, which I love.</li>
    <li> This is everything I want in a shampoo and conditioner!  The Oatmeal &amp; Honey shampoo and conditioner SMELL GREAT!  It smells like oatmeal &amp; honey WITH CINNAMON to me, and I love it!  Another thing I am thrilled about is that you can use very, very small amounts with big, big results … lots of lather.  This is like the same size Bed Head, which lasted me close to a year…but I love this scent more than any of theirs.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. I find more stores taking it off the shelves because it&#x27;s no longer trendy and I feel bad that I didn&#x27;t review this a long time ago. I have \\&quot;mixed hair\\&quot;. It&#x27;s fine, long, and curly. It can end up either dry or oily. Its got it&#x27;s own personality. My hair gets dry with Aussie and Suave. It gets oily with Pantene. Everything else just cleans it. THIS version of TIGI&#x27;s shampoo/conditioner set puts life back into my hair. My brother uses it on his thick coarse hair and loves it. My sister in law uses it on hair full, thin, straight hair and loves it. Both products condition well and smell great. Get it while it still exists. It&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;ve used it for years, and unfortunately it is discontinued on store shelves and the only way for me to get it is via the internet.  This usually isn&#x27;t a problem, but this last order was an exception.  I bought 4 shampoos and 4 conditioners, along with 4 bottles of a styling product.  All of the products were shipped in a large flat box, laying down.  One of the styling products had a crack in it with the cream seeping out - I cleaned it up, duct taped the crack and will use the remainder.  One of the shampoo bottles is also leaking, but I haven&#x27;t removed that from the plastic bag yet to clean it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why a company (not an Amazon mailing) would package liquid products laying flat in a box with no markings indicating they were fragile.  Any other time I&#x27;ve ordered these products online, they were shipped upright and had no leakage.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells absolutely delicious- my boyfriend can&#x27;t keep his nose out of my hair! It feels great on my dry, curly hair too. I used this years ago, and my main problem with it was the buildup it would leave behind. Hopefully they&#x27;ve corrected that issue, because I love this shamp/cond!</li>
    <li> My hair became less frizzy, more manageable, and much shinier shortly after I switched to this shampoo. Other people have been complimenting my hair more as well. After a couple days, one of my co-workers said my hair looked really nice and was wondering if I&#x27;d changed something. I told her I switched to this shampoo. Ever since then, she calls me &amp;#34;Silky Hair.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner.  Hair becomes soft, no fly aways and easy to manage. Smells Great! Good for adults and kids.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff....my only complaint is it is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair smell great, feel great, and look soft.&lt;br /&gt;I want more but can&#x27;t find it anywhere...........</li>
    <li> I have very thick strawberry blonde hair. It shows frizz like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and it drives me crazy! I asked my stylist which was the best drugstore brand to use and she recommended Pantene which is what I&#x27;ve been using. I was still frizzing though and no matter what after shower product I put in my hair, I was annoyed when I went to dry it! I knew that there had to be a better way, so I started searching. I saw a ton of reviews about Tigi&#x27;s Catwalk Oatmeal &amp; Honey and everyone raved about. I&#x27;m always leery about buying product online without being able to see it/smell it first, but I took a chance. I used it for the first time in the shower today and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is okay, it&#x27;s not my favorite but it&#x27;s very sweet and honey-ish (which makes sense!). The texture is nice and I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot to get an awesomely thick lather. I rinsed and then applied the conditioner. I used about half of what I did with my old conditioner and combed through it. I let it sit for about 5-10 minutes as I finished up with the rest of my shower. I rinsed and threw my hair up in a towel per usual. I usually wait about a half hour to an hour before blow drying because my hair is so thick and otherwise I feel like I have to blow-dry it forever which doesn&#x27;t help the frizz sitch. So anyway, I let it sit for about a half hour, put it some styling serum (I use It&#x27;s a 10!) and then let it sit for another twenty minutes or so. I literally had to blowdry it for less than ten minutes before I felt like everything was soft and dry. I combed through it, arranged my bangs, and just stared into the mirror. I have never seen my hair look this good before. It&#x27;s soft, it&#x27;s shiny, it&#x27;s NOT FRIZZY, and its laying so perfectly! It is just beyond anything I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased with this shampoo and conditioner and the added price (it&#x27;s about double what my old go-tos were) doesn&#x27;t even bother me because I used about half of the product I usually do! Can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
    <li> Be aware that this is not the lovely original formula of Oatmeal and Honey.  Completely different scent, ingredients, and hydration properties.  I got stringy, waxy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for the original in the bright blue-green bottles!  It is amazing in every way!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!</li>
    <li> works well, but this isn&#x27;t the old formula, and it&#x27;s noticeable.  The scent is off and in no way makes my hair smell like delicious oatmeal cookies, like the old blue packaging did.  Instead, it smells like oatmeal and weird slightly unpleasant chemicals.  If you don&#x27;t care how your hair smells, go for it... my hair looks shiny and much less frizzy.  If you want people to ask you why you smell so yummy, purchase the blue packaged version of this instead.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Makes my hair very soft. Great shampoo for a decent price. I like the shampoo better than the conditioner but I bought as a pair. So glad they brought this back.</li>
    <li> Love the product and the customer service.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair look really good but its not the same shampoo I fell in love with. Look for the green bottles if you want the yummy oatmeal cookie shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner pack is simply divine and smells like fall baked goods, it was so fitting that it arrived on the first day of fall! I admit, I&#x27;m a sucker for anything that smells like my grandma made it and this product is just like that. Other reviewers don&#x27;t like the smell, but honestly it couldn&#x27;t get any better unless it smelled like a pumpkin spice latte. It is color safe and I just had my hair done a few days ago and noticed that my color looked brighter! I have really fine but dense hair, so anything weighs it down but i found that there&#x27;s no sticky residue and my hair and scalp felt so clean after, I&#x27;m definitely buying this again!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Definitely buy it on Amazon as a set as I saw it in another beauty supply store for $25 each bottle!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for permed hair and they stopped selling it in the stores!!! I&#x27;m glad I could find it on Amazon</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible. I&#x27;ve used it for years and can&#x27;t find it in stores so I was so happy when I saw it online and it was cheaper than the salon prices I was used to paying! Never had a problem with this shampoo or conditioner. So to the person who wrote the review saying it was bad and the conditioner was thin it sounds like you got a bad batch or it was very old. It isn&#x27;t soposed to be that way. Hope you got some kind of a refund. Wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner...leaves my thick, somewhat difficult hair soft and shiny.  The smell is AMAZING, definitely the most under rated Tigi product out there</li>
    <li> It smells great and rinses clean, but it leaves my hair more tangled than before I washed it.</li>
    <li> This is a new cruddy formula. You might as well march down to your grocery store and buy Suave, I can guarantee the top ingredients will me the same. Gone are the quality ingredients and extracts. As of 10-13-14 the ingredients on the listing are not correct. I miss the old formula that left my hair feeling and smelling great...</li>
    <li> This is a great hair product, always has been, but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t packaged very well. The tops were not taped down so the conditioner had come undone and since they were shaken from side to side during delivery the top was being pushed down and a few tablespoons or so had squirted out. Fortunately they were packaged in a plastic bag so it did not get all over the inside of the box or on the DVD they were packaged with. BUT unfortunately I lost a few uses out of the conditioner bottle. I will still continue to shop at Amazon since this is the only negative that has ever happened in ALL the orders I have made. However, I hope you guys will consider taping down bottle tops in the future.</li>
    <li> It is very good, it smells good, but I know there is better ones out there</li>
    <li> Bought these as per my sister&#x27;s recommendation but I paid a WHOLE lot LESS than what she paid at the salon.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet….still waiting for my shampoo to run out but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love the product because my sister does and she and I have very similar tastes.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say that I use to buy this product in stores.  I was very happy when I saw I could buy on-line, however, when I received it and opened it up, the bottles had leaked open and was all over the place!  So, I had lost some of the product.  I probably will not order anything like this on-line again.</li>
    <li> I must I have never purchased anything online before.  I reviewed this product for a few weeks since I noticed my hair was dull and I couldnt find anything that would bring it back to life.  Much to my surprise I received the product much quicker than expected, it smells FANTASTIC and makes my hair soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t have the stray, frizzy hairs anymore and it&#x27;s gentle enough to use everyday. I am very pleased with this product and will be ordering more very soon</li>
    <li> Only shampoo I can used.  I even have a sister-in-law now hooked as it has no phospherics in it causing allergic reactions.  These guys have the best pricing also.  Can&#x27;t find it any more in stores locally but know I can always can&#x27;t on purchasing it here.</li>
    <li> I have only recently been introduced to these products, only to find out that TIGI has discontinued them. Thank goodness I was able to find the product available through a private seller on Amazon. My hair was severly damaged by a coloring process, and this is the only product I have found that makes it at all manageable, and leaves it looking shiny and healthy! The conditioner is what really is helping my fried out hair. Fast shipping from this seller! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner.  It works really well for my hair.  I would love it even more if it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells so yummy and leaves your hair soft and smelling good.</li>
