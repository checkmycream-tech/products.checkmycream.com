<li> They only had 2 Redken Extreme, so I picked this as the third item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have thick, curly, color-treated hair that needs a ton of intense conditioner.  </li>
<li> Dentagles well enough but doesn&#x27;t provide a super-soft coating that hydrates all day, which a lot of other Redken conditioners do.</li>
<li> Leaves your frizzy dry hair manageable!</li>
<li> Makes my thick hair feel soft and manageable!</li>
<li> I actually only need to use a little less of this than I do Redken</li>
<li> Extreme though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I use Redken Extreme Shampoo with this conditioner.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t buy any other brand, and this 33.8 oz.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is not too heavy on the hair, does not buildup or weigh the hair down.</li>
<li> The Extreme conditioner isn&#x27;t deep enough for my crazy hair.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> Just hard to find in salons.</li>

    <li> I have fine, thin straight hair.  Due to sun damage the hair on the top of my head has been thinning a bit.  I use Kerastase shampoo, then use the Redken conditioner and my hair is very well moisturized and very light.  I love the conditioner and I buy both on Amazon and they are best price.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I don&#x27;t buy any other brand, and this 33.8 oz. size is much more economical than the smaller sizes available locally.</li>
    <li> Works good. Better than paul mitchells tea tree line that i had been using</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel wonderful. I love using all Redken products as they make my hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to condition as well as it does. I figured it was more for control, to help tame your hair, since it is called Real Control. I actually only bought it because it was on the buy one get two free rack at a local salon. They only had 2 Redken Extreme, so I picked this as the third item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I tried it, I was in love. I had been using Redken Extreme for so long and thought nothing else would be as great, but this one really works well for me. My hair absorbs it right up and it smooths, conditions and detangles almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not too heavy on the hair, does not buildup or weigh the hair down. It rinses easily and you only need a little bit, so I expect this bottle to last me a long time. My hair is really long, to my waist, so I tend to go through conditioner super fast. I actually only need to use a little less of this than I do Redken Extreme though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very nice as well. Almost a floral scent, but not overpowering,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair loves this stuff and it styles so much better too. I have less fly aways and frizz. My layered curls/waves look great and feel softer.</li>
    <li> All appears to be as promised with this conditioner. It arrived in perfect condition no damage or leaking. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner... it really gets the tangles out and leaves hair controlled but not flat or wimpy.</li>
    <li> best product around for curly, thick or frizzy hair</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found to date. I love it!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> Again this is a product I ordered for my mother. This is the second bottle for her so she seems to be very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Quick, efficient arrived undamaged.</li>
    <li> Leaves your frizzy dry hair manageable! Salons are always trying to get me on a different shampoo but I refuse, I&#x27;ve used this for years and I love it!! Just hard to find in salons. Amazon and eBay are the cheapest.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner keeps it nourished and actually keeps the &amp;#34;fluffiness&amp;#34; of my hair under control.  Works great and conditions my hair very wll.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, color-treated hair that needs a ton of intense conditioner.  Most conditioners don&#x27;t even begin to quench my hair&#x27;s thirst.  This stuff does.

I use Redken Extreme Shampoo with this conditioner.  The Extreme conditioner isn&#x27;t deep enough for my crazy hair.  Real Control is fantastic though.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells wonderful. Makes my thick hair feel soft and manageable! Much better than the straightening conditioner I bought through Redkin.</li>
    <li> The best for curly hair.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the old-school drugstore shampoo and conditioner, Finesse. Don&#x27;t waste your money. There are far better products out there for this price.</li>
    <li> Nice smell, pretty good conditioning properties. Dentagles well enough but doesn&#x27;t provide a super-soft coating that hydrates all day, which a lot of other Redken conditioners do. Pretty good but not as rich as the Redken All Soft I used previously.</li>
