<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Brushes seem okay. I was expecting directions for face brushing to come with the order (implies that in the title). After not receiving that in my order today, I did find the fine print in the description that it was part of a download. I intentionally bought this higher-priced product so I could get something in print. Sorry now that I didn&#x27;t just get the other set I had seen somewhere else. Just a warning to read all the fine print and not just the super-long title all in bold print.</li>
    <li> Item as described, prompt shipment.</li>
    <li> I have always love Sublime Beauty products, their serums, lotion, creams and any other beauty products are on the top of my list. But this one, I was surprised when I got the package. It still comes nicely packed with their special nice pouch, but when I opened the pouch and saw these two brushes, wow, they are hard. They definitely are not soft like my facial wash machine. It is more like loofah. These bristles they claim to be natural made are really tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scared to use it on my face but it says it is for dry use or wet. So I tried it on dry face, well, very very very gently. My face is not sensitive to stuff but I don&#x27;t think that I can handle this kind of bristles. Hmm..  after scrubbing in circles, face did feel exfoliated, soft and smooth. I am going to just use it once a week. It works, but I don&#x27;t think that I can use it often. I also went on their site to see if there is instruction for using this facial brush. Well, I can&#x27;t find it. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it at discount in exchange for my honest review. It works but they are not soft at all.</li>
    <li> I have used the clarisonic, for years. If you would of told me that these facial brushes would replace my deep and enduring love for said clarisonic, I would of laughed at you. Your order comes with 2 brushes. I use one for dry facial brushing and the second I wet with a cleanser. My routine is as follows- The first few uses, I&#x27;m not going to lie, the face brush is stiff, so no heavy hands.....To clean/dry face, brush under chin, up and then outside of face, in. If this makes no sense, it didn&#x27;t to me at first either, they send you instructions. Your face is going to be red, don&#x27;t be worried. I wet my face/brush and apply Ceraveve foaming cleaner (use whatever cleanser you normally do), to the brush itself. I use circular motions and then rinse everything off. While skin is still damp, I apply rose hip oil. I do this 3 x&#x27;s a week, I think any more, your face would fall off.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love dry skin brushing and believe that it offers many health benefits.  I brush my body twice a day and my skin has never looked better and I feel so relaxed afterwards.  I wanted to dry brush my face as well but its hard to find a small brush and I don&#x27;t want to use the same brush that I use on my body for hygiene reasons.  I found Sublime Beauty and their face brushes and knew I HAD to have them!!&lt;br /&gt;I love them!!  Now my face is receiving the same benefits as my body.  My skin is less greasy, smoother and exfoliated without irritation.  I brush three times a week and absolutely love every moment of it, it feels so good!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend dry brushing for anyone who hasn&#x27;t had the chance to try it.  It is awesome, its great for your body and it feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted cost, in exchange for my true and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> even with soft touch, my face became red after using it.  I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Way too scrubby and hard.  Tried to condition my skin to get used to the extra hard bristles, but just couldn&#x27;t handle it and gave up after a few tries.  Not even sure if my feet could handle that much scrub.  OUCH.</li>
    <li> awesome brushes. my first time using any and they work great!</li>
    <li> I grew weary of my $$ electronic face cleaner. It worked fine, but the battery didn&#x27;t last for many uses and it took a long time to charge. Decided to simplify &amp; purchased these brushes. They are nice quality just firm enough and never need charging. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> These are a little bit rough on the face, but maybe they need to be.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt so good.</li>
    <li> Great brush, well made. Some of the brush fibers (is that what they&#x27;re called?) come out.</li>
    <li> The product is very poor quality. The bristles started falling off once I touched it. I have to return it.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Would not expect anything less with this brand. Their dry body brushes are top notch as well! Nothing has amped up my detox protocol more :-).</li>
    <li> This company is AMAZING. A couple of weeks after I made my purchase, I received a follow-up email asking how I liked my new facial brushes. I responded in to this email that I had watched the video--as suggested--on how to use the facial brush, but found the brush too stiff, especially when I brushed around my eyes, as per the instructions on the video.&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of hours, I had a response from the owner of the company. She explained that there were two brushes, one firmer than the other; I must have been sent a set of firm brushes. She sent me--at no cost to me--a set of softer brushes. These brushes arrived today. Although I have not used them yet, I can feel the difference and am looking forward to using them soon. She also included lots of samples for me to try.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally IMPRESSED with this company. I recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> These brushes are rather stiff and hard for facial brushes. My body brush is way softer than these. I will find another use for them though. They are good quality. Just not for my face.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product! The quality is excellent as well as the results! Customer service is great! I totally advise women to try this. My skin is looking beautiful, bright and tight. I am gonna continue with this beauty routine.</li>
    <li> The instructions for these brushes say to microwave the brushes to kill bacteria. DO NOT DO THIS! The brushes started melting &amp; flaming within seconds of being in the microwave.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this brush.  I bought the body brush and this one and love both of them.  I am a 60 year old woman and my face was looking my age.  After using this brush several time my face has a glow to it again.  And I love using the brush.  It feels so good!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy an electric face brush, buy this instead and get better results. If I only knew about it before I bought Olay Pro-X brush which I gave to away after buying this.</li>
    <li> The bristles are quite stiff and almost painful.  I&#x27;ve been using dry brushes for years, this brush is just a little too rough.</li>
    <li> Was a present for teen daughter. Bristles fell out during first use. Daughter not interested in continuing to use.</li>
    <li> Never used a facial brush before. First day of use I thought they were unusually rough, but you learn to work with them and after a week I enjoyed using them. Great for cleaning oily parts of your face and they also even skin tone by acting as a mild exfoliant. Do not press down hard but just let them glide across your skin. Takes a bit to get used to, but I found the results worth it. Though I use a Clairsonic pretty regularly, this is a good substitute when I don&#x27;t have a lot of time. Received for discounted price in exchange of honest review.</li>
    <li> Works great to shape my beard.</li>
    <li> Excellent item,thanks.A+++</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this! Am currently using  this in conjunction with the body brush sold by the same vender.  My face has such a healthy glow!</li>
    <li> This brush is way way too hard for facial skin....it even scratches your legs or arms...where the skin is not as tender.</li>
    <li> Good quality brushes! not to hard and not to soft!</li>
    <li> These brushes seem well made (no bristle shedding so far), but they are a lot stiffer than I&#x27;d hoped.  My skin can sometimes be sensitive, and I feel like I need to use these brushes very very carefully to avoid irritating my skin.  The also didn&#x27;t come with instructions.  It&#x27;s easy enough to find the instructions on the company website, but given that &amp;#34;How To Guide Sent With Purchase&amp;#34; is part of the product name, I expected printed instructions.</li>
    <li> My brushes arrived promptly and I received follow up emails with complete instructions on how to use them.  After just the first use, my skin felt soft and smooth!  Great product!  Wonderful customer service!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this facial brush.  I have been using it for quite awhile now and I love it.  I can really see a difference in my skin.  Not only that, I honestly look forward to washing my face at night.  I used to dread it and, as I&#x27;ve gotten older have foolishly neglected washing my face nightly more times than I care to admit.  I&#x27;m a skincare product freak...love to try new things....but sometimes my laziness gets the best of me.  Since receiving this brush I have been so much better about washing my face nightly because it just feels so darn good.  Plus, I have seen the difference in how clean my skin has been getting and how much smoother it looks.  I also use the Sublime body brush and highly recommend both products to anyone!  You will not only feel a difference in your skin but you will see a difference as well.  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed smoother skin after brushing my face, I  just wish the brushes were a bit softer, as I find them pretty firm. They do provide great exfoliation though,  which is the main goal. I will continue to dry brush both face and body for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Use this brush every day . I am a avid skin brusher and this is great for your face. Don&#x27;t bother with creams till you start skin brushing as it&#x27;s the best way to exfoliate your skin.</li>
    <li> Description was exact, no issues.</li>
    <li> I have normal to dry skin which is usually not sensitive in the least bit and I have a hard time with these face brushes because they are just way too rough and scratchy feeling. I have used many other of Sublime Beauty&#x27;s products and loved them so I was kind of disappointed here. I do like the fact that they are smaller and the perfect size for traveling. I also like that they came with a cloth drawstring bag to store them in. When I first received them the bristles on both brushes were a little flattened or smooshed but that&#x27;s not a huge deal breaker for me. I tried to like these a lot but every time I place the bristles on my face it hurts. I would honestly compare it to rubbing my skin on a pricker bush or porcupine. I have read other reviews which say the brushes just need time to soften up although I&#x27;ve been trying for a month and they haven&#x27;t become any softer. Even though I am not able to comfortably use these just yet I can say that they are made well and sturdy at least. The wooden handles are very nice and the bristles, while rough, do not fall off and seem to hold shape very well. Hopefully my set will indeed soften up and I will be able to use them in the future. In that case I would be able to rate much higher but as for now I don&#x27;t see much use for these. I did receive this product at no cost to myself for testing purposes. Regardless, my opinions remain completely my own and unbiased.</li>
    <li> I love this cute facial brush, it is comfortable to hold in my palm as I have issue of gripping.  The bristles are just right in height, and soft/firm enough for brushing my face.  Thank you Sublime Beauty!!</li>
    <li> I titled my original review as &amp;#34;Happy Skin, Happy Me&amp;#34;, and that is still the fact. It has been several weeks since my purchases of the Original Body Brush, the Face Brushes by Sublime Beauty along with the Travel size Skin Brush. I use all the brushes on a daily basis. I actually look forward to my shower because I know I get to Skin Brush my body and face before showering. I find the Travel size Skin Brush the most useful, which is great for everyday, not just for travel, with the Original Body Brush perfect for my back. The Sublime Face Brush is the ideal size for facial contours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow the skin brushing as set out in the brochures sent by Sublime Beauty. I am thrilled to report that I no longer have dry, flaky, sometimes referred to as ashy, skin on my legs and arms. I was tired of throwing money away on creams and lotions. I actually went one day without lotions and creams after Skin Brushing and showering. I never thought it would be possible, but Sublime Beauty Brushes have cured my dry skin by eliminating that layer of dead skin cells that attached to my pants, my slippers, my socks, and my tops. I am 62 years old, and with age comes thinner, drier, and more delicate skin. I can&#x27;t sing the praises of these brushes without sounding gushy, but when a simple idea, perfect brushes solve my dry skin problem there are not enough words.</li>
    <li> I am starting to body brush and I thought why not try on my face. These brushes are the perfect size and work well to dry brush your face.</li>
    <li> My skin feels amazing after I use it....the bristles are hard, so keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> I just received these today.  The bristles on the brush began to fall off immediately upon using the brush on my face.  I am going to return.</li>
    <li> This should only be used once or, at most, twice a week. It is softer than the body brush, but it&#x27;s still pretty rough. However, after every time I use it, my skin is much smoother. It&#x27;s a great physical exfoliant; I use a &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; exfoliant (Philosophy) when I want to add some treatment.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  At first it seemed that when I brushed my skin would break out so I didn&#x27;t use them as much.  Then I figured out that the impurities were being drawn to the surface so I started brushing daily.  My skin is softer now and the  break outs have stopped.  I now brush twice a day!</li>
    <li> It is a good brush but needs to be &amp;#34;broke in&amp;#34; as it was to rough for my face. After awhile it softened up.</li>
    <li> This was a great value and I do love the brushes. They are a good quality product and work as expected.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes.  I use one for cleansing and the other as a dry brush.  You can also share one with family or a friend.  Great product.</li>
    <li> They are great! Perfect softness/harness and durable, even through weekly washes. And there are two of them!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome. I keep one in the shower and one at my sink. I wet the bristles with hot water and then add my face wash to it. I have no discomfort, use it often, and have just as good of results as other methods of exfoliating. I am 60 and it&#x27;s a staple in my face maintenance regiment.</li>
    <li> i was not sure i would like these....  but i love them.  I have my teenage son using one and I am using the other.  be gentle....</li>
    <li> Bristles shed a bit at first use.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sublime beauty facial dry brush. I love it! I use it along with Sublimes facial serums and the Face Whisperer facial cream. I love it, you can see the results almost overnight. I was using another very well known skin care line for  couple of years. After using these products, I cancelled my account. I am all for results and Sublime delivers!</li>
    <li> Great brushes - not too hard, not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> I love all my Sublime Beauty Brushes! I have the face and body brushes and they are absolutely fantastic. My complexion has cleared up considerably since I started the facial brushing which I do 2 to 3 times a week. As for the body brushes - I have the long handled brush and the handheld one and wow! talk about feeling invigorated! I&#x27;ve ordered more for my husband and daughter and they are hooked now too. And the online instructions from Sublime are wonderful also.</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome! I had dry skin that no amount of moisturizer could penetrate, mostly on my cheeks and forehead. After I started using these brushes, that problem is entirely in the past!</li>
    <li> Who knew???  I love these wee brushes and I can&#x27;t believe how great they make my skin look.  I used a Clarisonic brush but I kept breaking out with it and couldn&#x27;t change the brushes often enough to stop it from happening.  I even soaked the brushes in peroxide but still had issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These handy little guys feel great!  They smooth my skin and I even notice that some brown spots are fading... I also bought the body brush and travel brush and they are all just amazing!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, I love the brushes and can see a difference already in my skin. Doesn&#x27;t look dry.</li>
    <li> Sublime Beauty FACE BRUSHES with Pouch, 2 Pack works fantastic on my face. My pores have never been so clear. This is a must have for any woman. Would be perfect for a gift. Since they come in a small little bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;Any skin type; skin brushing improves skin quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Natural Wood, Natural bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I thought that brushing my body sounded cray but I tried it out and it was great. I have been doing it for a months now. It has improved my skin drastically. So, when I found these face brushes I was all in. If it improved the rest of my body that much I thought trying out my face was a wonderful idea. It is just as amazing as I had hoped. I have used several product from Sublime Beauty and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet. Make sure you follow the directions if you use a body brush because there are a couple of differences. The brushes are very nice though and come in a pouch to keep them clean.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free or a reduced price in exchange for  my honest opinion as seen above.</li>
    <li> Bristles started falling out at first use but probably just breaking itin. We&#x27;ll see</li>
    <li> These brushes seem to work well and makes your skin feel clean.</li>
    <li> Requires a break in period to smooth out the bristles. I did notice an improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> Bristles too harsh for face. Works well on legs, arms, etc.</li>
    <li> Love these little brushes!  Before, my skin was dull and I would get a lot of break outs.  Now my skin seems much clearer and healthier.  Would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I received this in the mail and washed my face immediately.  This face brush is soft enough to really exfoliate and not abrasives at all.  I really love the size of this brush as well.  I can work it all of my neck and face very easily.  I am a true believer of skin brushing because of my results from doing this on going for a while in my regimen but this is going to be a great addition to my face as well.  Love it and as usual,  thank you Sublime Beauty.</li>
    <li> While I am a huge fan of dry brushing as a way to improve circulation, exfoliate dry skin, etc. these brushes are entirely too hard for sensitive facial skin.  There was no technique I could use that made these brushes NOT feel as if I was rubbing a porcupine against my face.  Would not buy again.  Will be pursuing the refund.</li>
    <li> They do a nice job cleaning the pores and stimulating facial circulation. Good to use after full face makeup</li>
    <li> Glowing, disappearing blemishes, better absorption of my creams, clear, lighter (skin color), refreshed, tighter (alot)... to break it in I rubbed it on my forearm in the shower /.....1000 times better than my 200 dollar clarisonic...</li>
    <li> I use this product three times a week and it has helped reduce my dry skin on my face!</li>
    <li> Bristles are a bit too stiff for me, but I have fairly sensitive skin...</li>
    <li> The Sublime Beauty Face Brush is seriously the best thing that has happened to my skin. My skin has been very dry and flaking and no typical exfoliator has been helpful. With the Face Brush my skin feels polished and smooth and has seriously been glowing. Thank you Sublime Beauty!</li>
    <li> Love them! Noticed a huge difference just after one use. Prefer the brushes to my clarsonic.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! They make my skin feel so soft! I love dry brushing my body, but the body brushes are much too rough for your face. These face brushes are perfect! I love them!</li>
    <li> Love the face brushes. Instruction video was not provided in the package but the founder, Kathy, emailed me following up on the order and was courteous enough to provide the video. The strength of the brushes just right for my skin, even though I have sensitive skin. Follow the instructions and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Perfect brush.  The brush from top to bottom is close to 6\\&quot; and at first appears small until you use it and realize it&#x27;s the perfect size.  If fits very comfortably in your hand.  The handles are wooden.  The brush head is about 1 1/2\\&quot; and is just the right softness/hardness to appropriately be used as a facial brush without damaging your skin in any way.  It is compact and comes with 2 brushes and a little sack along with directions from their website on dry brushing. With two brushes, one can be used for dry brushing and the other with your favorite cleanser.  The handle is close to 1/4\\&quot; at widest point at base and tapers to 3/8\\&quot; in center where your index finger and thumb would rest as you&#x27;re holding it and this small difference is subtle but helpful and ensures a more comfortable hold for your hand.  I think these can be hard to find as they go out of stock quickly.  Five stars!</li>
    <li> I had heard about skin brushing for quite awhile, but dismissed the effusive reviews as group-hype responses to the latest health craze.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.  I was assigned two weeks of dry skin brushing in a college health class, and after reading reviews until my eyes nearly bled, I settled on these face brushes and the body brush also made and sold by Sublime Beauty.  After my first use, I&#x27;m a believer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are of very high quality.  The handles are sleek and sturdy, clearly made to last for years, and the bristles are soft enough not to scratch, while being firm enough to exfoliate and stimulate blood flow.  After just one week my skin is already more clear and feels softer than it has in years.  I look forward to seeing the difference skin brushing makes after an extended period of time.  Using the brush is easy and the seller has a website with instructions on face brushing for those, like me, that appreciate a visual example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner of the company contacted me the day after delivery to ensure that I&#x27;d received the product and to answer any questions I might have.  That&#x27;s the kind of customer service that ensures my loyalty and future purchases.</li>
    <li> this brush is to stiff for my face.  I would not recommend this item to anyone</li>
    <li> I love the feel of my face after using this brush. Using the brush is a firm sensation but not scratchy.  My skin felt velvety and glowed after the first use.  The brushes are well-made and since I don&#x27;t intend to get them wet, I am hopeful that they will be long lasting.  I have recommended this product to friends and co-workers.  Excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I feel some huge difference in my skin but I will say that I just like this brush.  It feels good when I&#x27;m doing the brushing (according to the guide this company provides) and I think my skin may feel a little softer right after.  I like all the information they provide about skin brushing &amp; I just like the company as they really seem to believe in their product and provide lots of good info on the website.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Like the brush a little stiff  maybe after more use it will get softer.</li>
    <li> These little brushes are great! I had not dry brushed before and these are easy to use with very helpful instructions (in the form of a PDF). Dry brushing your face is not quite the same as dry brushing the rest of your body. The key is to use a light touch and there are very specific strokes for different areas. Don&#x27;t press too hard or it will hurt. I no longer use anything else to exfoliate my skin except dry brushes. These are well made and shed very little. I&#x27;ve been using the same brush for months and I think they&#x27;ll last a pretty long time before needing to be replaced. Would give five stars if made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I will use this to clean tile grout. It is WAY too stiff and harsh to use on skin. I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just starting out with the face brushing. Only doing it every 3 days as my skin seems sensitive. I love the clean feeling after brushing and washing.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I purchased the entire brush set after my physical therapist said dry brushing would be good for lymph issues I have from breast cancer. I can already see an improvement in my swelling and the softness of my skin. I would recommend this to friends. Arrived on time and just as described online.</li>
