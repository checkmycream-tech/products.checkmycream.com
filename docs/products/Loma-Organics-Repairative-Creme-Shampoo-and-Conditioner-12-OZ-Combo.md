    <li> I have fine, dry hair, which is just curly enough to frizz. I was hoping to like Loma Organics Repairative Creme Shampoo and Conditioner, but in the past I&#x27;ve found some organic hair products to be sticky or otherwise unpleasant for one reason or another. Not these! My hair feels so soft and manageable after using these Loma products, with no dry or frizzy feel to the ends anymore. I love it! I am also using Loma Maximum Volumizing Solution and Fortifying Repairative Tonic, which I also love. I bought them locally at full price, but they&#x27;re available on Amazon at a discount.

    <li> I have naturally curly hair that likes to frizz.  Recently, while visiting my sister, I used her shampoo and conditioner.  I can not tell you the difference it makes.  My hair is soft and holds up through out the day without becoming a big ball of frizz.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments.  My hair curls better.  I don&#x27;t know how to explain that.  It just does.  It also smell so nice.  I use this in conjunction with One and Only Curl Creme and Love Potion #9 Wearable Treatment.  I towel dry my hair then apply these.  I scrunch my hair and let it air dry.  I&#x27;ve worn my hair short for years because the longer it gets the harder it is to manage.  My hair is now longer than it has been in a decade, and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love most of their products, figured I&#x27;d give this a try. Shampoo/conditioner- not their strongest suit. Hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after 2 shampooings, conditioner doesn&#x27;t feel like it does anything that a good conditioner should do.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product - this is the only product my hairdresser will use.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, I especially like the scent, its fruity but not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but overpriced</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have used others but keep coming back to this one. Highly recommend giving this hair product a try.</li>
    <li> High quality product....my hair is shinier and healthier looking.</li>
    <li> Both these items create a clean soft texture to my hair</li>
    <li> Would recommend this to anyone that colors their hair.  This leaves the hair shinny and so soft.  My hairdresser recommended it and I&#x27;m so glad she did</li>
    <li> Love it! Have been using for about a month and can notice a visible difference in my hair it is much healthier. I have fine hair that usually gets oily within a day if I don&#x27;t wash it, with this I can go two days.</li>
    <li> Great product. For long straight hair, ease up on the treatment amount if planning to curl or style in any manner other than straight or result will be too &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;. Lifesaver in winter months.</li>
