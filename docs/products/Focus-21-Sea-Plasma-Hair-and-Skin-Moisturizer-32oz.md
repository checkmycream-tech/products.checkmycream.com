<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great stuff!  It used to be available at local drug stores and I always bought it!  Great for hair, scalp, and, sunburn!  I always make sure I spray it down my back, over my shoulders,  when I have been in the sun, burned or not- It is so refreshing!  Your skin and scalp will love it!  Leave it in after a shampoo, or spray your hair at night and sleep with it moisturizing- there is no wrong time to apply it!  Try it!  It also helps detangle, too!</li>
    <li> I used to use this stuff a looooong time ago and totally forgot about it, when I received my package I could smell it through the packaging, just what I remembered!!! This stuff is so great and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Quality cosmetic for hair and skin freshness, particularly during drying home heating of winter; 30+ years of tradition in our house.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product with a lovely scent.  I was first exposed to this at my Colorado hairdresser and she told me what it was in her spray bottle.  I&#x27;m delighted I asked her as I have enjoyed using this.</li>
    <li> Sea Plasma is wonderful! I have been using it for 10+ years.  I spray it on after a shower and it smells so fresh.  It keeps my skin soft and moisturized.  It&#x27;s like wearing lotion only a lot lighter on the skin.  Not at all greasy.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> This product is great moisture for your hair.  Both my husband and I use it and love it.  It used to be available in the stores, but we can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore.  We&#x27;ve been using it for years.  Good to see it available online!</li>
    <li> This is the best product at the best price. Really makes your hair soft and shiny! Works great as a detangler, smells awesome! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Makes my hair and skin soft!</li>
    <li> feels very good on the hair and say on the hair I used it all most every day I will buy again...</li>
    <li> This is an excellent leave-in product for detangling and moisturizing hair.  It&#x27;s very lightly scented, water-based and non-sticky when it dries.  Overall, it leaves hair softer and more manageable, and an extra spritz more on the ends helps to alleviate some of the dryness.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost seven years and when my local drugstore stopped carrying it, you could tell by the looks and feel of my hair.  I&#x27;m really thankful to have found it through Amazon.  BTW, Deals on Demand shipped the product one day ahead of schedule, carefully taped, sealed and packaged with no leakage or breakage.  A great product at a great price from a company that seems to care about customer satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Great product - a classic</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 15 years (it used to come in a black spray bottle).  I have mostly used it after sunbathing to soften and smooth my skin.  It seems to keep you from peeling after a sunburn when used after the bath each day and several times daily.  It feels wonderful and is the best product I have EVER used for sunburn.  Makes the skin silky, not tight and dry after sunbathing.  It also reduces sun damage to the hair and makes it feel great!</li>
    <li> I live in a dry climate and my very long, fine hair suffers from a lack of moisture.  Long hair gets old and ratty on the ends if not taken care of properly - the ends of my hair are several years old and need to be babied.  I like to use lots of olive oil, conditioner and moisturizer to prevent damage to the ends.  This product is a must have to keep my hair in tip-top shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredient is a form of salt that retains moisture on any surface it is applied to -whether it is skin, hair, or nails.  This is not table salt (sodium chloride), but a moisture binder called Na-PCA.  It coats my hair shaft with a thin layer of moisture rich conditioner and stays there until it is washed out.  I like this protective coating, but I have to be careful not to use too much or it will weigh my hair down.  Just a light spritzing will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my face as a last step after applying makeup.  It gives my skin a moist, healthy glow and causes my makeup to look more natural and less \\&quot;painted on\\&quot;.  I use it throughout the day to refresh my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives are that it can get too heavy for hair if not applied sparingly.  And it can give hair a slightly stiff feel when too much is used.  But used lightly, it gives a much needed moisture boost to parched hair, and that is very valuable to someone like me who has long hair in an arid environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other versions of this product (different brands) that I find at the health food store, but those other brands are too heavy.  I like Focus 21 because it is light, nicely scented (some people think it is too fragrant), and has other ingredients besides the Na-PCA, such as aloe, silicones, etc that add to it&#x27;s conditioning properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Focus 21 is difficult to find on store shelves, and I am glad to find it on Amazon.com.  At the time of my purchase, I was able to get free shipping, which saves me the time and gas it would have taken to find it locally.  This is a product I don&#x27;t like to do without.product I don&#x27;t like to do without.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 10 years.  I spray it on my hair before blow drying and my hair stays wonderfully soft and silky.  I also color my hair regularly and another customer at my hairdresser told me last week she couldn&#x27;t get over how healthy my hair looks even after coloring it so often! &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never tried it for sunburn but I definitely will this summer.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you try this fabulous product!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for the mother-in-law who simply raves about it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Focus 21 Sea Plasma for years, mainly as an aid when shaving my legs - either in the shower or as a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shave.  Just spray this on your legs in the bathroom and shave, rinsing your razor under the sink - great for a quick shave!  I also use it to spray my back in the dead of winter.  It&#x27;s hard to get skin back there moisturized, sea plasma is a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using it for other purposes (in my hair, on my skin in place of lotion, as a facial toner, etc., but it didn&#x27;t stick as a go-to product in any of those situations - hence, four stars.</li>
    <li> Makes hard water &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; feel like it is washed in soft mountain water. Just a couple of spritzes is all that is needed - too much and it will flatten even the fleeciest hair.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Seaplasma by a beautician about 20 years ago and I have been using it ever since.  I have short, curly hair and I was it every day.  When I pat it dry, I put just a little of the moisturizer (about four spritzes) on the palm of my hand and rub it on my hair.  It gives it a shine and it acts a conditioner.  I also use it on my face under a cream moisturizer.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the only product of it&#x27;s kind that my daughter will use. This is not her first order and I know that it won&#x27;t be her last.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 30 years.</li>
    <li> I have used this product to control static electricity in my long hair for at least 8-9 years. I have also used it in all of my sons hair in the morning to comb out tangles and flatten out bed head for them. I don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on their skin. Just rub it in! I love the mild fragrance as I find so many sprays are so heavy in these days. I just have trouble finding it local stores these days. I hope it is just because they are switching the design &amp; not because they won&#x27;t carry it any more. It is good to see I can always order online!</li>
    <li> Love it and so hard to find in stores now!  Thank you, fast shipping and saved money even if I could find it.  I&#x27;ll be back for more soon :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I&#x27;ve been using bit for 20+ years!!!  I was so happy to find it here!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair &amp; it&#x27;s murder to comb through but this makes it like butter! It smells so good too! I love it when people tell me my hair smells good! Wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. Too bad, can No longer purchase at local store.</li>
    <li> This Focus 21 Sea Plasma moisturizer is the best thing for sunburn; keep spraying it on every time your burn begins to hurt, and if you peel at all, it will be VERY little, and you&#x27;ll keep the tan.  It feels great, isn&#x27;t greasy, doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor, and is so-o-o-o cooling and soothing.</li>
    <li> I just love the smell of this and the way it makes me think of the beach.  I use it in my hair and on my body, even on my dog.  Makes her smell good and her coat is shiney.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have a Maine Coon Cat by the name of Churchill.  He is handsome and substanstial at 22 pounds. He goes to work with me as a pet therapy cat and he needs to be well groomed and relatively allergy free.  Churchill gets brushed with Sea Plasma to control his long fur, eliminate odor and make him ready to WOW the residents while wearing hats, sun glasses and just hanging out to offer purrfect moments every day.  He loves Sea Plasma and it has been a part of our grooming routine since he was a kitten.  Of course I use it too.  Linda</li>
    <li> Smells SOOOO GOOOD! Like sun-warmed skin and fresh air...also, moisturizes and lasts all day. Not particularly expensive either. Good for men or women.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over thirty years.  I spray it on my hair before I use my hot rollers, I&#x27;m 68 years old, and my hair holds its style for four or five days. The ultra store where I have been purchasing this product stopped carrying it and was I glad I could order it on Amazon. Thank you</li>
    <li> Great seller, have done business with them several times and will continue to do so. Gray product, have used it for years on my fine flyaway static hair. Simply love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This is a must have!  It has a great scent of the surf from the ocean and a hint of sunshine while on a beach in Florida.  I use this in my hair and skin in place of perfume since I work in a hospital.  No offensive smell here.  When you need a pick me up in the afternoon...spritz and little over your face and skin and maybe spritz a coworker or two for an overall mood lifter!</li>
    <li> If i use enough to do anything.  I do like the smell, but I probably won&#x27;t bu this again.  The large container will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and when I found it on Amazon I was very Happy.  The price was excellent and the fragrance was great.  I will order again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and love it! It works great on sunburns, as a foot soak and now I use it for my 6yr olds curly hair. Living in Houston brings out the frizz in his curls but when I spray this in, it defines his curls and he gets tons of compliments. It also leaves his hair so soft.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this is a great product to tame it down in the am, adds moisture and no weight, plus it smells nice.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!!  I have used it for many years.  I have very long hair, and there is NO BETTER WAY to remove tangles than to spray it with this product.  It&#x27;s great for first thing in the morning or upon removing hair accessories.  And I always spritz it on my face at the same time -- it feels soooo soothing and refreshing!!  I just love this product - can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!  I would recommend it to everybody, but especially to anyone with long hair and to parents of little girls:  believe me, a few sprays of this will help you avoid a lot of frustration and tears when brushing hair!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product.  She uses it on her hair and she loves it.  The scent is very pleasant and she doesn&#x27;t have to use perfume.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this product as it smells like the fresh sea to me. I did not notice that no spray nozzle came with it. I don&#x27;t wish to pour it all over me either. Just a heads up to make sure you buy a spray nozzle that will fit in this bottle to use all over your body and hair. Delivered fine and no leaking. Arrived on time. I think the smaller bottles do have a spray top already. Wish I&#x27;d paid closer attention. WOW such a nice clean scent !! Best stuff around. Thanks again Amazon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not easy to find Sea Plasma, and when I find it, the price is often off the charts.  It was a treat to find my favorite hydrator at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This leaves your skin so soft and smooth after a shower.  A must buy if you have dry skin!</li>
    <li> Great product for frequent swimmers.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 6-7 years now. It&#x27;s my \\&quot;secret\\&quot; for softer skin and hair. I mist my face with it before applying moisturizer and must again to set my make-up. I mist my hair with it before styling too. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this.  It does calm the frizzies.  I wish I could find the shampoo somewhere.  I have the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for 30+ years and always spray my hair to comb it out. Spray on your face and body for the softest skin. When your hot a quick spritz and instant cool.</li>
    <li> I totally love this product :)  my daughter has used a face spray moisturizer for several years and talked me into trying it! It feels wonderful and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Have been using this product for years. I use it on hair and skin and it does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d see this product again until I ran across it here on Amazon - what a great find!  Sea Plasma is an unbeatable light-weight hair detangler and makes my currently over-treated hair shiny and soft.  A friend said yesterday, &amp;#34;your hair is so shiny - I hate you...&amp;#34; which I take to mean, it&#x27;s not just me - it really *works*!  It&#x27;s great for skin as well - I basically mist myself all over after a shower, with extra throughout my hair.  I also mist it over my makeup, since I use powder-based foundation blush, etc., and it &#x27;sets&#x27; the makeup perfectly.  The scent is light, and the mister that comes with the smaller spray bottle (I have my original bottle from a previous purchase) delivers exactly the right amount of product - true mist, not blobs and splatters.  I&#x27;m so glad to have Sea Plasma again!</li>
    <li> this is wonderful stuff. love it</li>
    <li> I used to get this at a beauty salon years ago but since they changed hands I&#x27;ve been searching for years to find it.  Now that I&#x27;ve found it here, I&#x27;ll be back again for more. Refreshing on the face for a pick up, it also keeps my hair so soft and much less dry from a/c areas &amp; dry heat during winter.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It is light in feel and the smell it leaves on your hair.  I also squirt a little on my face and neck on hot days.  The scent is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years and wouldn&#x27;t switch!</li>
    <li> I have used this product on my skin and hair every day, religiously, for over 20 years.   I use nothing else but soap and water to clean.  I constantly get comments about how youthful and healthy my skin is.  But, also, my husband and I both use it on burns and cuts and we have found it helps heal in half the time.  It is very effective in taking the sting out of burns and sunburns.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff on my hair for many years, ever since discovering it in my local drug store in New York City.  I have long, wavy hair, and nothing prevents dryness or frizziness like this lovely-smelling, light spray.  I spray it on when my hair has air-dried just a little.  I&#x27;m so glad I can buy it online, because I really couldn&#x27;t do without it!</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from really dry skin and he uses Sea Plasma everyday along with Eucerin Aquaphor. Unfortunately, Rite Aid had stopped carrying it. We were glad to find it here in Amazon... and in a bigger size! Minus 1 star because the bottle has no seal. Anybody could open it and put some other stuff in there. Hopefully the manufacturer, Focus21, would do something about this.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, fresh light fragrance and smooths &amp; refreshes dry hair.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful for your hair or skin, I have used it for a long time and I love it.</li>
    <li> This is completely multipurpose. I use this as a leave-in conditioner prior to combing through towel dried wet hair. Works fantastic!  I even use it on the kids and use it as</li>
    <li> All time favorite.  Have ordered for years and will continue to  do so.  Light, refreshing for all day use..</li>
    <li> did not smell good.....i could not get past that</li>
    <li> Smells divine and is wonderful to keep my hair from getting too dry during the day. It&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer for my face because stuff is either too dry or too greasy for my face. This is just perfect. Absorbs very well, leaving skin and hair soft and nourished. I put it in my hair after shampooing as a leave it and it sets my curls perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years to mist on my face and hair.  H2O has a similar product that costs 3 times as much.  I hope they never stop making this.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, use it as spray conditioner, second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I use it to refresh my hair and to help me blow out my hair the day after I have washed it.  It works very well!!</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, light leave in conditioner? Great for any hair type. Great seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years on both my face and hair.  A light fregranced mist moistens your skin to prep it for your moisturizer.  It also dampens hair for easiest styling.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I use this throughout the day in the hot desert climate of southern California over my skin lotion. It works wonders for my dry skin. Refreshing and love the scent.</li>
    <li> love this perfect for moisturizing skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. I use it before styling and during the day to perk up my do. So there</li>
    <li> Besides the obvious uses described in previous reviews, whenever I feel tired, I close my eyes and spritz a little Focus 21 Sea Plasma on my face.  It rejuvenates me.</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for many years.  Works really well on dry skin and especially well on a sun or wind burn to sooth and help heal.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday........</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years!  My grandchildren love it when I use it on their hair...no tangles!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I ran across this product years ago when I was looking for leave in conditioner on a camping trip around 2006 or so.  This was the closest thing to help with wet hair tangles.  I spray on my hair after shower and I can put a comb through my hair without ripping at tangles. I use it on my granddaughters hair when wet as well. Works better than no more tangles!</li>
    <li> Product was shipped and received as ordered. I am satisfied with the service of the seller as well as the product. I have used Sea Plasma for years since living in California and cannot seem to find it in stores on the East Coast so I appreciate being able to get it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love the product. Love the service. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Lovely product that  glad to have invested. Spray in hair to detangle and moisturize. Non greasy and smells lite and fresh. Seller shipped fast and package very nicely with no leakage.</li>
    <li> Have loved this product for over 30 years.  I use it to get tangles out of my fine, long hair.</li>
    <li> Great product for skin and hair</li>
    <li> I love Focus 21 Sea Plasma Hair and Skin Moisturizer!!  It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I rarely use any other styling product because it adds volume and shine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this stopped being a staple on shelves around the country because it&#x27;s a really great product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 20 years to set my makeup and to refresh my skin after a long day.  The spray also is a great hair moistener for refreshing my &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34; after a long day.  I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ll survive if they ever stop producing this - or - if Amazon stops carrying it.</li>
    <li> First of all, before this product even arrived, the company started emailing me asking me to review it IF I liked it.  Two more such requests came by email during the following two weeks, during which time the product arrived.  What an atrocious practice that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this now for six months or more, and there is no improvement to my dry hair at all.  As far as a facial spray, it&#x27;s pleasant enough to use and provides a little dewiness for a short time.  I do not live in a dry climate at all - just the opposite.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough NaPCA in it to do any good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a waste of money, the company was obnoxious, and I would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome for your skin &amp; hair !! Love it ! Thank You !!</li>
    <li> My husbands must have product</li>
    <li> Great price and drlivered faster than promised</li>
    <li> This product is #1. For many years my family has used it and lately it was not available at the stores in our area. I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon. If you never used it, you should try it. Keeps the skin young looking and hair too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 25 years.  I use it primarily on my hair.  It&#x27;s great to use after a shower to moisturize and help in styling.  I also frequently use it to restyle my hair throughout the day.  I few sprays, a fluff and I am ready to go.  It is also good on the skin.</li>
    <li> Best stuff in the world!  I have 3 bottles in constant rotation:  The purse, the car, the house.  The scent is so fresh and clean, I can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
    <li> This is a hard to find and inexpensive product that is excellent for giving hair body, shine and reducing static &amp; tangles for blow drying. You can also spray it on your body for moisture. Natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> Love this product and use it daily. Also spray on my dogs coat and it makes her shine!</li>
    <li> Anyone who uses a blow dryer, curling iron, or hot rollers should have this wonderful stuff on hand. It adds electrolytes to hair and skin, moisturizes without being oily, and adds a lovely scent without smelling like chemicals. On those days when I&#x27;m feeling irritably dry, I just mist this on and ahhh, feel so much better. The smaller size has a great pump, too, that sends out a fine, barely-there mist. It&#x27;s perfect for spraying on your face to set your makeup.</li>
