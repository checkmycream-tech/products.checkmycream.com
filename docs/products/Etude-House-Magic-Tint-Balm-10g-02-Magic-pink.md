      <li>Container was a fairly good size.</li>
      <li>:) would buy again!</li>
      <li>It is smooth on the lips and is a beautiful color on the lips.</li>
      <li>I love the color and all but the product does not satisfy my hopes!</li>
      <li>I wish I had ordered more than just one!</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Love the color! ,</li>
      <li>This is my favorite lip gloss!</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
      <li>The color is so good on my lips :)</li>
      <li>I was kind of expecting it to be thicker like that Rosebud balm in the tin...</li>
      <li>it gives u a nice color to your lips</li>
      <li>But it gives a nice color to my lips.</li>
      <li>This is a good tinted balm if you want a very fresh and slightly more noticeable color to your lips.</li>
      <li>very light product.</li>
      <li>But this is very smooth and not like a balm...more like a lip gloss...</li>
      <li>&amp;#62;_&amp;#60; I dont regret buying it at all. :3</li>
      <li>I love that I can put this on and look finished but</li>
      <li>I rated it 4 stars because i wished it lasted more than 2 hours.</li>
      <li>I love the way it looks on my lips.</li>
      <li>I love this alone or over lipstick.  </li>
      <li>love love love</li>
      <li>Etude House is one of my favorite Korean brands.</li>
      <li>In fact, I love everything I&#x27;ve ordered by Etude House.</li>
      <li>I hope there&#x27;s more colors out there because I would love to experiment and try them all!lol</li>
      <li>smell well...and look so cute....</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I got this.</li>
      <li>This a pretty good tinted lip balm.</li>
      <li>Adds easy polish to even the most relaxed looks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product for a price that is very affordable.</li>
      <li>They really have good quality products.</li>
      <li>Too easily softened by heat</li>
      <li>smells so good and lips get so soft after wearing it!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recommend putting on more than a swipe or two because this isn&#x27;t a balm, its more of a gloss gel (in my opinion) that does get sticky after a certain point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>It has a nice color to it and hydrates really well.</li>
      <li>Nothing special here.</li>
      <li>Etude House gives you a lot of product that is good quality for a low price.</li>
      <li>so it should last you a good while.</li>
      <li>The only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is that the beautiful cursive font on the top rubs off the lid after a while.</li>
      <li>This is more of a sheer tint, or a lip gloss, this doesn&#x27;t change how much I love it.</li>
      <li>when I don&#x27;t use a moisturizing balm over this the color is a lot more vibrant and gradually fades</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the strong cherry sent but the color is very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>a pretty doll-y pink- not too bright or light.</li>
      <li>if you like pink, this is a good product for your face&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;</li>
      <li>Oh my god this was such a nice lip balm tint</li>
      <li>my lips are so soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>It was better than I expected and came early, If you are looking for a product with good consistency, color, price, and moisturizing effects get this product.</li>
      <li>I left mine on the counter for a day , and it pretty much softened to the consistency of warm butter .</li>
      <li>My favorite color is magic pink by far</li>
      <li>I love how moisturizing this product is and the pigmentation is very nice; it is subtle but definitely there.</li>
      <li>Very creamy and moisturizing and a pretty color.</li>
      <li>It is a very smooth pink color when I put on my lips.</li>
      <li>for whatever reason, this product gave me a HUGE pimple on my upper lip which took 2 weeks to go away, and it scarred afterwards.</li>
      <li>Rubs off fast.</li>
      <li>I have more products from Etude House than any from any other Korean brand.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super pigmented, but applies sheer.</li>
      <li>So you get a high shine burst of color.</li>
      <li>It stays on far longer than I thought it would and really moisturizers</li>
      <li>is nearly all gone since I hold so much stuff in my purse.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit thick, almost like warm Vaseline</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for casual days, or anytime you want a hint of lip color without the intensity of a lipstick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Oh and by the way I live in Minnesota</li>
      <li>Keeps lips very soft.</li>
      <li>It smells a little strong, and tastes almost rubbery.</li>
      <li>it really is a mix between a balm and a gloss which works really well with my 24/7 dry lips.</li>
      <li>so you end up with the prettiest natural lips ever.</li>
      <li>I generally apply this product before applying a lip tint.</li>
      <li>Pink and red tint, but both are similar, and again VERY vibrant .</li>
      <li>This balm has a soft texture and a pretty, subtle popsicle pout effect.</li>

<li> just not what I thought a &#x27;balm&#x27; would be.&lt;br /&gt;That said, the color is really pretty and blends down to suit a wide range of skintones.  </li>
<li> This tint is VERY vibrant, and a little goes A LONG WAY.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s just very goopy and thick and can obviously cause skin problems.</li>

<li> It almost has a neon pink tone to it.</li>
<li> So a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Not worth a purchase.</li>
<li> I was afraid this color would end up being a hot pink of sorts</li>
<li> It&#x27;s probably the size if a half dollar and it lasts a while.</li>
<li> a few dabs from the pot and tap it onto your lips</li>
<li> dunno, I usually like their products</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this if you want a very subtle amount of color.</li>

<li> but i&#x27;m too scared to use it again :(</li>
<li> but this was a :(</li>
<li> the worst was that it was embarrassing and looked like a herpes sore :(</li>

    <li> This tint is VERY vibrant, and a little goes A LONG WAY. It doesn&#x27;t taste or smell very good but its great quality. I have two of these in different colors. Pink and red tint, but both are similar, and again VERY vibrant .</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip gloss! smells so good and lips get so soft after wearing it! definitely buying it again!</li>
    <li> I love this! Etude House is one of my favorite Korean brands. I have more products from Etude House than any from any other Korean brand. They really have good quality products. I love how moisturizing this product is and the pigmentation is very nice; it is subtle but definitely there. I generally apply this product before applying a lip tint. Very nice and it is very big so it should last you a good while. Etude House gives you a lot of product that is good quality for a low price. Awesome!</li>
    <li> Container was a fairly good size. It has a nice color to it and hydrates really well. :) would buy again!</li>
    <li> This balm has a soft texture and a pretty, subtle popsicle pout effect. Would buy again! Adds easy polish to even the most relaxed looks. Keeps lips very soft.</li>
    <li> When I wear it on my lips it can&#x27;t help but be noticed by people. I always get compliment whenever I have it. It&#x27;s a good product for a price that is very affordable.</li>
    <li> very light product. Not too sticky. Rubs off fast. does not leave lips chapped.</li>
    <li> I love this alone or over lipstick.  It is glossy, not sticky and makes my lips feel hydrated.  I wish I had ordered more than just one!</li>
    <li> The color is so good on my lips :) It last like 2 or 3 hours, i wish it lasted longer but it&#x27;s great..my lips are so soft and smooth! &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; I dont regret buying it at all. :3</li>
    <li> Oh my god this was such a nice lip balm tint it gives u a nice color to your lips</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t nourish my lips. I like bright lips but this was a garish color, something about the transluscentsy. I dunno, I usually like their products but this was a :(</li>
    <li> Very creamy and moisturizing and a pretty color. It smells a little strong, and tastes almost rubbery. But it gives a nice color to my lips.</li>
    <li> it really is a mix between a balm and a gloss which works really well with my 24/7 dry lips. when I don&#x27;t use a moisturizing balm over this the color is a lot more vibrant and gradually fades so you end up with the prettiest natural lips ever. I was afraid this color would end up being a hot pink of sorts but I&#x27;m so glad I got this. a few dabs from the pot and tap it onto your lips and you&#x27;re set for the day. I use a lip balm throughout the day but I&#x27;m used to it anyways because of my dry lips. this product will last you forever!! love love love</li>
    <li> Love the color! ,&lt;br /&gt;like cherry pop color!&lt;br /&gt;gives it fullll shine and moistrizes your lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order it again!</li>
    <li> I was kind of expecting it to be thicker like that Rosebud balm in the tin... But this is very smooth and not like a balm...more like a lip gloss...does that make sense?  I guess I just wasn&#x27;t expecting this texture, not that it&#x27;s bad, just not what I thought a &#x27;balm&#x27; would be.&lt;br /&gt;That said, the color is really pretty and blends down to suit a wide range of skintones.  I love that I can put this on and look finished but not overdone like a lipstick would be.  It&#x27;s great for casual days, or anytime you want a hint of lip color without the intensity of a lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product in a great package.  I hope there&#x27;s more colors out there because I would love to experiment and try them all!lol</li>
    <li> This is not a balm (in my opinion) as the description states. This is more of a sheer tint, or a lip gloss, this doesn&#x27;t change how much I love it. I love the way it looks on my lips. It&#x27;s a bit thick, almost like warm Vaseline I would say. It&#x27;s probably the size if a half dollar and it lasts a while. The only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is that the beautiful cursive font on the top rubs off the lid after a while. My favorite color is magic pink by far it just looks so beautiful on my lips, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d regret this purchase,</li>
    <li> This lip gloss is awesome! It&#x27;s super pigmented, but applies sheer. So you get a high shine burst of color. The tint hangs around after the gloss is gone and it&#x27;s not sticky. I love it!! In fact, I love everything I&#x27;ve ordered by Etude House. They don&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> Nothing special here. Not worth a purchase. I bought it because I&#x27;ve had good luck with Korean cosmetics, but I rate this a &#x27;pass&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It is smooth on the lips and is a beautiful color on the lips. It was better than I expected and came early, If you are looking for a product with good consistency, color, price, and moisturizing effects get this product.</li>
    <li> This a pretty good tinted lip balm. when i put it on, my lips are a pretty doll-y pink- not too bright or light. This is a good tinted balm if you want a very fresh and slightly more noticeable color to your lips. It was supposed to arrive 3-4 weeks after i ordered it but it came in about 10 days. I rated it 4 stars because i wished it lasted more than 2 hours.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is great. It stays on far longer than I thought it would and really moisturizers well. It is pinker than I thought it would be. It almost has a neon pink tone to it. So a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I received the item on time, I use it every day when stay in home........It is a very smooth pink color when I put on my lips.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the strong cherry sent but the color is very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this if you want a very subtle amount of color. I don&#x27;t recommend putting on more than a swipe or two because this isn&#x27;t a balm, its more of a gloss gel (in my opinion) that does get sticky after a certain point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect the holographic design on the lid to stay -mine is nearly all gone since I hold so much stuff in my purse.</li>
    <li> for whatever reason, this product gave me a HUGE pimple on my upper lip which took 2 weeks to go away, and it scarred afterwards. the worst was that it was embarrassing and looked like a herpes sore :( if you have any clogged pores around your mouth, do NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. it&#x27;s just very goopy and thick and can obviously cause skin problems. maybe that was just a fluke but i&#x27;m too scared to use it again :( i would definitely not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Too easily softened by heat I left mine on the counter for a day , and it pretty much softened to the consistency of warm butter . I love the color and all but the product does not satisfy my hopes! Oh and by the way I live in Minnesota so leaving it Sealed on the counter should not have been an issue.</li>
    <li> this product is so good. smell well...and look so cute....if you like pink, this is a good product for your face&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;</li>
