      <li>It goes on like silk, works well and smells so nice.  </li>
      <li>I am thrilled to have found this product (thanks to my friend Kelly)!!&lt;br /&gt;IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!</li>

      <li>and this is my favorite night moisturizer.  </li>

      <li>if so, I will buy more.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Then I found &amp;#34;When Hope is Not Enough&amp;#34; and fell in love.  </li>
      <li>This is really lovely stuff.  </li>
      <li>but otherwise I do love it and havent had any adverse reactions.</li>
      <li>I love this cream for that at night.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I use the Hope in a Jar, which I love, I tried this</li>
      <li>Usually I love the smell of Philosophy products but</li>
      <li>I love this face cream.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for several years now and it is the best.</li>
      <li>This product is heavier than Hope in a Jar which I seem to like just a bit more than this one.  </li>
      <li>Now, I love it.  </li>
      <li>My skin never looked better.</li>
      <li>I simply love this product.  </li>
      <li>I suppose any moiturizing product is better than none but would not buy it again.</li>
      <li>e able to see it anymore</li>
      <li>I am 41yrs old, and this is the most amazing moisturizer I have ever used, I love it!</li>
      <li>It applies easy and is not greasy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d much rather put EVOO on my face than the ingredients that are contained in most moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Like with most other things from Philosophy, you have to rub it between your fingers to warm it up before applying.</li>
      <li>You might be better off waiting to place your order til the new year.  </li>
      <li>You might be better off waiting to place your order til the new year.  </li>
      <li>I question whether this cream is safe to apply to my skin, when it has such a strong fragrance.</li>
      <li>It really helps with dryness, fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this product was ever right....</li>
      <li>It has a silky feel, it moisturizes amazingly well, it penetrates into your skin, and one jar lasts a long time</li>
      <li>The combination of the two has worked better than any other name brand out there; I have gotten real results, making my wrinkles more diminished than ever before.  </li>
      <li>that tells how safe various products are.  </li>
      <li>it was thicker, to be sure, but I felt like it just sat on my skin and didn&#x27;t actually penetrate.  </li>
      <li>I tried out the moisturizer the first day I got it.  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>I love this entire line from Philosophy.  </li>
      <li>To be more specific, if I would scratch my face, skin would flake off.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great for my dry skin especially for this winter weather.</li>
      <li>This cream really moisturizes and restores my skin to soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>After reading the positive reviews on Amazon, I decided to try this cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure others do not keep price in mind as long as the product works for them, but I do.</li>
      <li>Clean your face with purity made simple by philosophy first.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 27, so I can&#x27;t really comment on this product&#x27;s skin-firming/anti-aging capabilities, but even simply as a moisturizer this stuff is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>, I have found a product that has been moisturizing my skin very well:  </li>
      <li>She normally uses Olay, but this product really knocked her socks off!</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t bother me nearly as much.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to emphasize that you really don&#x27;t need to use much at all at one time - abide by the saying, &amp;#34;a</li>
      <li>I was very hopeful that \\&quot;When Hope is Not Enough\\</li>
      <li>If you massage it into your skin too much, it does &amp;#34;ball</li>
      <li>Really soaks in without leaving it greasy.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
      <li>I read other reviews that said that the scent is overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>After you do this, it goes on smooth and silky and moisturizes all night long.</li>
      <li>Its wayyyy more moisturizing than Hope in a Jar and less greasy than the Miracle Worker line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Plus, it seemed like my skin looked older when I was using this product, which I did not like.  </li>
      <li>I mostly use this in the cooler months because my combination skin gets dry and needs the extra moisture.</li>
      <li>I had been using plain Hope in a jar and just loved it, but with dry winter skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, it works that&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>I live in Colorado.</li>
      <li>This was supposed to be new but was not sealed and had hardened.  </li>
      <li>I was &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with adult-onset acne and thus have to be very, very careful with what I put on my skin (because nothing says &amp;#34;successful young professional&amp;#34; like a face full of pimples!).  </li>
      <li>I decided that while Hope in a Jar is a great moisturizer, I needed something with some extra moisturizing qualities behind it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Put help me on first, then when hope is not enough.  </li>
      <li>I tried the regular &amp;#34;Hope in a Jar&amp;#34; back in college, and while it was silky and felt nice, it wasn&#x27;t nearly moisturizing enough to use as the kind of serious, nighttime, major-skin-repair product I needed to face the blistering icy windstorms of Rochester, NY</li>
      <li>In the morning, my face is still soft and not dried out from over night.</li>
      <li>Always a dependable product, no matter how old you are.  </li>
      <li>Maybe too old?  </li>
      <li>and I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>This cream goes on very light and silky but I have dry skin and have to apply it two to three times just so my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight.</li>
      <li>The first time I put it on, it was a little too much, but it worked so well that I tried it again</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a new night treatment that WORKS, get hope is not enough combined with help me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product isn&#x27;t what I expected, the smell is what I don&#x27;t like. Usually I love the smell of Philosophy products but Hope Is Not Enough doesn&#x27;t appeal to my sense of smell.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and dry. It gets even worse in the winter. I am happy I found this product. It does it&#x27;s job perfectly &amp; smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this moisturizer did not work well for me.  I suffered from extremely dry skin on my face.  To be more specific, if I would scratch my face, skin would flake off.  After washing my face or applying make-up, I would have flakes of skin in my hairline because my skin was so dry.  I was very hopeful that \\&quot;When Hope is Not Enough\\&quot; would help.  I tried out the moisturizer the first day I got it.  I actually put it on two different times that evening.  The following morning, I did not see any improvement in my dryness.  My skin was still flaky.  I didn&#x27;t give up, though.  I thought that it might take some time to heal.  I continued to use the moisturizer each evening for at least a week.  My skin was still not moisturized the way I had hoped it would be.  Plus, it seemed like my skin looked older when I was using this product, which I did not like.  Unfortunately, I had to pay a hefty price for a moisturizer that did not work for me.  I also found out that this product does not contain the best ingredients.  My brother told me about a website ([...]) that tells how safe various products are.  This moisturizer did not rate too highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, thanks to a suggestion from my little brother, I have found a product that has been moisturizing my skin very well:  Extra Virgin Olive Oil!  I&#x27;ve been washing my face with EVOO and then applying it after removing my make-up.  So far, the results have been very, very good.  My face is finally moisturized.  I can scratch my face and there aren&#x27;t any flakes of skin that are left behind.  My skin looks really good too.  I suffer from acne and it has actually improved this condition since I began using EVOO.  I&#x27;d much rather put EVOO on my face than the ingredients that are contained in most moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This was not the same as it has been!  Different color -different odor!  Maybe too old?  or a knockoff?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27, so I can&#x27;t really comment on this product&#x27;s skin-firming/anti-aging capabilities, but even simply as a moisturizer this stuff is fantastic.  I was &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with adult-onset acne and thus have to be very, very careful with what I put on my skin (because nothing says &amp;#34;successful young professional&amp;#34; like a face full of pimples!).  Practically everything makes me break out, and the things that don&#x27;t aren&#x27;t very good at moisturizing.  I tried the regular &amp;#34;Hope in a Jar&amp;#34; back in college, and while it was silky and felt nice, it wasn&#x27;t nearly moisturizing enough to use as the kind of serious, nighttime, major-skin-repair product I needed to face the blistering icy windstorms of Rochester, NY (I went through an entire 2-oz jar in like a week and a half).  Then I tried &amp;#34;Hope in a Jar&amp;#34; for dry skin and hated it - it was thicker, to be sure, but I felt like it just sat on my skin and didn&#x27;t actually penetrate.  Then I found &amp;#34;When Hope is Not Enough&amp;#34; and fell in love.  It has a silky feel, it moisturizes amazingly well, it penetrates into your skin, and one jar lasts a long time (thank goodness).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this as a daytime moisturizer.  If you massage it into your skin too much, it does &amp;#34;ball up&amp;#34; a little bit (not as much as some other products I&#x27;ve tried, but yes it still does ball somewhat), so I don&#x27;t think this would be good for underneath makeup.  Also, it&#x27;s heavy and can look slightly greasy - so again, not good for daytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to emphasize that you really don&#x27;t need to use much at all at one time - abide by the saying, &amp;#34;a little dab&#x27;ll do ya&amp;#34; - so if you object to the heaviness/slight greasiness, you might be using too much.  Use less of this product than you&#x27;re used to using with other products.  Yes, the texture is slightly waxy/buttery, and you will have to rub it between your fingers for a few seconds -- as you do this, the cream &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; and you might not be able to see it anymore (but don&#x27;t despair - it&#x27;s still there!) -- and then apply to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final comment about the listing - good grief, it&#x27;s up to $50.00 now?  Philosophy may have discontinued this item (I may be wrong about that, and I hope I am) because it&#x27;s getting fairly difficult to find.  However, I purchased this just a few months ago on Amazon for about $38.00, so be aware that the $50.00 price tag may simply be a pre-holiday inflated price bump.  You might be better off waiting to place your order til the new year.  Or maybe the price has gone up because supply is dwindling and Philosophy isn&#x27;t making it anymore, in which case yikes, maybe I ought to stock up...e able to see it anymore (but don&#x27;t despair - it&#x27;s still there!) -- and then apply to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A final comment about the listing - good grief, it&#x27;s up to $50.00 now?

    <li> I simply love this product.  It goes on like silk, works well and smells so nice.  I read other reviews that said that the scent is overwhelming.  The first time I put it on, it was a little too much, but it worked so well that I tried it again and it didn&#x27;t bother me nearly as much.  Now, I love it.  This is the first year that my skin is holding up in the cold weather.  I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
    <li> I use this every night,along with philosophy&#x27;s product \\&quot;help me.\\&quot;  The combination of the two has worked better than any other name brand out there; I have gotten real results, making my wrinkles more diminished than ever before.  If you are looking for a new night treatment that WORKS, get hope is not enough combined with help me. Put help me on first, then when hope is not enough.  Clean your face with purity made simple by philosophy first.</li>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews on Amazon, I decided to try this cream. Unfortunately the fragrance is so overwhelming that I developed a minor headache the three times I wore the cream. My husband also commented that he thought the scent was overwhelming. I question whether this cream is safe to apply to my skin, when it has such a strong fragrance.</li>
    <li> This product is heavier than Hope in a Jar which I seem to like just a bit more than this one.  Overall, I have still noticed that my lines are diminishing.</li>
    <li> I do not live near a store that sells Philosophy skin care. My order arrived quickly and was a great price. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> this cream is old and has a stale smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since it came out a few years ago. I really miss it when I run out because my face becomes very dry. It really helps with dryness, fine lines and wrinkles. It&#x27;s worth the price. Also, I always order via Amazon and whether it comes through Philosophy or Sephora, it&#x27;s always here within a few days. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I am 41yrs old, and this is the most amazing moisturizer I have ever used, I love it! After reading some of the negative reviews I was hesitant because its not cheap and I have fairly sensitive skin but I haven&#x27;t had ANY issues and I use it twice a day. I had only been using it for one week when I started getting compliments on my complexion. By the way, it does have a slight chemical smell but nothing TOO horrible, I&#x27;m ok with the smell it fades pretty quickly. I am thrilled to have found this product (thanks to my friend Kelly)!!&lt;br /&gt;IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great for my dry skin especially for this winter weather. Really soaks in without leaving it greasy. Although it does have an odd smell to it but I am not super sensitive to it so I deal with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product was ever right....maybe it was just mine but it was the weirdest texture</li>
    <li> Although this product is super moisturizing, there are better products out there for me that are far less expensive. I&#x27;m sure others do not keep price in mind as long as the product works for them, but I do. I expected this product to in turn, enhance the texture of my dry skin and it did not.</li>
    <li> Everything I have gotten from philosophy has been sealed.  This was supposed to be new but was not sealed and had hardened.  Not worth spending the money and time to send it back so it  went  in the trash.</li>
    <li> Feels so good on my skin, the peeling has subsided. Skin feels great. And look great too, I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years now and it is the best. I use it at night for my deep moisturizing cream. In the morning, my face is still soft and not dried out from over night.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews regarding this product and even though some said that they didn&#x27;t care for it because it was difficult to apply I bought it anyway.  I&#x27;m very pleased I did.  I love it.  It applies easy and is not greasy.  Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  The best night cream I&#x27;ve purchased and will buy agian.[[ASIN:B0007UNGFY Philosophy When Hope is Not Enough Replenishing Cream, 2 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I love this replenishing cream from Philosophy! I&#x27;ve been using it for about10 yrs  along with Phil Hope in a Jar cream. My skin never looked better. I mostly use this in the cooler months because my combination skin gets dry and needs the extra moisture. I really don&#x27;t mind the smell. I know it&#x27;s an issue for some people. It eventually goes away.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin. You won&#x27;t be disappointed at all.</li>
    <li> I had been using plain Hope in a jar and just loved it, but with dry winter skin I thought I would move it up a notch and go with When Hope is not Enough. I did not like the texure _ a bit greasy for me and the smell was like motor oil. My skin took awhile to even absorb it.  I went back to regular Hope in a jar.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I live in Colorado. It is a semi-arid climate. Good moisturizer is very important here. I use this in the morning mixing it with the 3-6-9 oil. It is amazing! Thank you Philosophy.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on very light and silky but I have dry skin and have to apply it two to three times just so my face doesn&#x27;t feel tight.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream. It works on my superdry skin. It&#x27;s like a daily spa treatment. I&#x27;m hooked on all the philosophy products. It&#x27;s the only thing that nevers irritates my skin and I see visibe results. I won&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Out of all the philosophy products Ive tried this is the only one that I still use. Its wayyyy more moisturizing than Hope in a Jar and less greasy than the Miracle Worker line.&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily, night and day.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a lemony- lime kind of smell that takes some getting used to but otherwise I do love it and havent had any adverse reactions. Im on my 2nd month using it.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck if you decide to purchase this!</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, absorbs and works well, great product!  Have middle-aged skin and this is my favorite night moisturizer.  I love this entire line from Philosophy.  Noticeable improvement over other night moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I just turned 40 last year. I decided that while Hope in a Jar is a great moisturizer, I needed something with some extra moisturizing qualities behind it. I love this cream for that at night. It seems very thick, but a little goes a long way. Like with most other things from Philosophy, you have to rub it between your fingers to warm it up before applying. After you do this, it goes on smooth and silky and moisturizes all night long. I&#x27;ve worn it once under makeup and it was to heavy, but as a night time moisturizer you cant go wrong with this product unless you apply it wrong.</li>
    <li> This is really lovely stuff.  I have dry and sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m in my early forties.  This cream really moisturizes and restores my skin to soft and smooth.  I am big fan!</li>
    <li> I have used Hope In A Jar for years and switched to Hope Is Not Enough as I have aged!  It does the job.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas present for my 71-year-old mother.  She loves this stuff!  She normally uses Olay, but this product really knocked her socks off!</li>
    <li> I bought the product thinking it was the same as Hope in a Jar.  I suppose any moiturizing product is better than none but would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Leaves skin feeling soft.  Product is a little thick but not too much.  Necessary for over 40 skin.</li>
    <li> I use the Hope in a Jar, which I love, I tried this and I would not purchase it again, I will stay with Hope in a Jar.  This one has a smell that I do not like, and it is thick, and I do not think it does as well a job as my other one.</li>
    <li> It made my skin red and irritated. Really disappointed since I tried it a few years ago and it worked well then, so maybe they changed their formula?</li>
    <li> I use it every night.&lt;br /&gt;we&#x27;ll see if I look younger when its all gone. if so, I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Great product. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It is very effective, especialy on the neck area. I have been using this produce for about a year and in that time I saw definate diminished lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Always a dependable product, no matter how old you are.  Also, it does last a long time.  Will keep on using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, it works that&#x27;s why I can&#x27;t live without it, skin feels so good and it does take years off your face!</li>
