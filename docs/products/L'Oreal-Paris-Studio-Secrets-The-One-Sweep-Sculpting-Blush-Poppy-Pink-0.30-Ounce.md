    <li> So I got this expecting to like, I liked the brush but the blush had no.Color at all and the sculp side came out like a white powder. It was also very chalky.</li>
    <li> great product, just to light for my skin</li>
    <li> How does it look on black skin?</li>
    <li> Love this makeup! I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> This blush is amazing! I am so in love with it! So easy to use, and looks flawless. I had my doubts. But I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the worst beauty product I have ever received. This crap is so chalky and barely pigmented. It feels gross and heavy on my skin. I would never purchase this again, nor would I recommend this product to anyone. The brush doesn&#x27;t even work that comes with it... not that I expected it to but I am highly unsatisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Today I receive the order item. When I open that, I found surprise that the cap of the item was broken. Then I found the brush was used with black ink released. The brush head turned harden and never can be used again........</li>
    <li> it was larger than i thought it would be, and it comes with a sculpting brush, but i dont like it, i just use my own brush and it works grate. it was my color, but everyone is different, so you can make up your own mind. i would buy it again, mayhaps when i run out</li>
    <li> Will not buy again, product seems too dried out or something, i used to buy it in the stores and it was good, but they dont sell it anymore. I had to switch to Revlon.</li>
    <li> a gift for friend but the color is darker than expected</li>
    <li> It is a perfect color</li>
    <li> Penelope D.&lt;br /&gt;I really Love the product, I&#x27;d buy again. Thanks..</li>
    <li> LOVED THE PRODUCT BUT THE LID BROKE RIGHT AWAY.</li>
    <li> I usually use the brand and like  it , Good quality , and I usually order for family and friends too</li>
    <li> I did not see  this product when it was sold in stores. After I missed out on Rihanna&#x27;s MAC collection, I saw that this was a dupe for her blush and contour set. It works well. One side is a blush and one side is a contour. While the contour shade is too light for my skin shade ( dark) I blend both together and use the &#x27;blush as a contour&#x27; method. I purchased it knowing that the contour shade would be too light for me to contour with, I actually do like the product,</li>
    <li> Complete crap, waste of money! It&#x27;s chalky and doesn&#x27;t even work!</li>
    <li> Takes the effort out of shaping and coloring.  Love this!</li>
    <li> love this bronzer and blush-looks great</li>
    <li> Love this blush. Shipped out so fast, I was amazed. And a fraction of the local store price!</li>
