      <li>I love these wipes.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and feel of this wipe</li>
      <li>She does not use a lot of makeup but was glad to get these to remove what she does use.</li>
      <li>I also love these for traveling when I want to have a washed face but it isn&#x27;t convenient to locate a restroom.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of almost everything Olay makes for many years.  </li>
      <li>For this reason I will probably stick with the target store brand I currently use that costs about 4 cents per sheet with excellent results.</li>
      <li>My granddaughters favorite thing to do is play spa.</li>
      <li>So, they offer better value than their price might suggest.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love using these types of make up removers while I travel and at the gym.  </li>
      <li>With one cloth I was able to wipe it all off.  </li>
      <li>I am genuinely pleased.</li>
      <li>I love not having to wash my face in the winter.</li>
      <li>My partner and soul mate has tried a good number of make-up removal products in all categories (liquids / lotions / wipes) and the Fresh Effects</li>
      <li>and this got more after that</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I like these cloths and would recommend them :)</li>
      <li>think for the price and how well these works I have to suggest them to anyone looking for a more affordable make-up removal cloths.</li>
      <li>I love Olay</li>
      <li>There is an ingredient that is not skin safe and needs to be off the market.</li>
      <li>They have a wonderful scented smell and they actually get the eyeliner and mascara off easily.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave me oily like Almay brands do and also leaves me skin feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>It also did a pretty good job on removing my waterproof mascara.</li>
      <li>My use of these wipes may not be what Olay intended, but they&#x27;ll have a repeat customer for the long term with how I intend to use these...and isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about? :D</li>
      <li>They are a good size, and there is a decent amount of wetness to them, although there could be just a tad more moisture in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Breaking my own rules, I took a chance with these Olay Fresh Effects make up removal wipes.</li>
      <li>To test these out I put on a full face of makeup!  </li>
      <li>I am a skin buff along with being a makeup artist when sometimes a makeup wipe is an easy to cleanup.</li>
      <li>Her comments were that these are very soft and have a light scent which is pleasant.</li>
      <li>It has a nice light fresh  scent that dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>The smell is wonderful and the moisturizer is kind to my skin without irritating it.</li>
      <li>I use a oil free moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>So far, these wipes have done a good job of removing a mineral foundation, light blush and powder.</li>
      <li>For no makeup, or just light makeup, one wipe will effectively clean your face.</li>
      <li>pretty sure it was a fluke thing.</li>
      <li>and I still don&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
      <li>We used these wipes to clean it all up.</li>
      <li>They have just the right amount of moisture and the resealable bag makes it easy to keep them on me when I travel.</li>
      <li>They are not heavily scented although they have a nice clean scent to them.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a very light scent that is ambiguous \\&quot;floral\\&quot;; since I work with plants all day long, it absolutely does NOT smell like jasmine, but it does have a pleasant odor.</li>
      <li>Wish I could say Fresh Effects did better, but sadly, no.</li>
      <li>Perfect solution for 1) late at night when you don&#x27;t feel like washing your face 2) traveling and 3) not wanting to get lipstick or mascara on your towels.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands of wet facial cloths and like these the best of any I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
      <li>Only pro - it smells good...</li>
      <li>/&gt;These clothes are pretty good at removing foundation (I use liquid foundation since they are more acne-friendly than heavy powder, with a concealer on top of the spots to finish the job).</li>
      <li>The lotion is clean and leaves no residue, and they smell fresh and clean.  </li>
      <li>These are essentially the same price, work great on sensitive skin, and have a great smell.</li>
      <li>Other than that, they are a great product for the job they are intended for.</li>
      <li>I am falling in love with their whole Fresh Effects line.</li>
      <li>I love these and find them to be so convenient, for times when I simply want to grab a cloth and get my makeup off as easily and quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If you have acne and your face feels super dry, it can overstimulate the sebum glands to make more oil, so be sure to use a moisturizer when you&#x27;re done.  </li>
      <li>but the after effects are not fresh but more like a disaster!!</li>
      <li>I even used a second one to see if would pick up any more makeup and nothing was there!  </li>
      <li>Thanks again Oil of Olay!!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s important to note that I wear very light makeup (no foundation, little powder) and my mascara is not waterproof - so my face is easy to wipe clean.</li>
      <li>The Olay cloths still don&#x27;t completely remove my mascara with one or two swipes, but they get most of it off.</li>
      <li>wipes are her favorite so far.</li>
      <li>Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects</li>
      <li>My \\&quot;other\\&quot; self is complete \\&quot;Girly-Girl\\&quot;, which I&#x27;m sure</li>
      <li>I can remove a face full of makeup (including mascara) with one large cloth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the wipes to be very effective at removing grime from the horse barn after my usual morning routine of cleaning stalls, feeding six horses and riding - my face ends up with a layer of dust, hay partical dirt, horse dirt and sweat.</li>
      <li>Works better then my store brand removal cloths plus it is the same price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That may just be personal preference, but I feel as though fragrance-free is better for skin</li>
      <li>Have tried many others and these actually do take off all makeup and does not irritate my eyes or skin like others.</li>
      <li>By the time she is finished, I am slathered in much more face product then you would ever wear on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>I like to feel clean facial skin, and these make it fast and easy to have that feeling without water and cleanser.  </li>
      <li>I use both drugstore (NYX, Covergirl) as well as higher end stuff</li>
      <li>/&gt;She says they&#x27;re more durable than any other pad she&#x27;s used, and seem to be more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;: she only needs to use on pad to completely clean her face (in fairness</li>
      <li>Olay in general has great products, but this one is a lot like all the other make-up remover cloths I have used -</li>
      <li>Fresh Effects works well for other things like eye shadow and liner and eyebrow filler, however, and the scent is light and clean.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these wipes. Have tried many others and these actually do take off all makeup and does not irritate my eyes or skin like others. Thanks again Oil of Olay!! Would like for Amazon to add a larger quantity as a subscribe and save option.</li>
    <li> Perfect solution for 1) late at night when you don&#x27;t feel like washing your face 2) traveling and 3) not wanting to get lipstick or mascara on your towels.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Gave these to my wife. She does not use a lot of makeup but was glad to get these to remove what she does use. Her comments were that these are very soft and have a light scent which is pleasant. They do an excellent job of cleaning and do not irritate the skin. She said that she had used Olay products when they were called Oil of Olay. She plans on purchasing refills when this package runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Waterproof mascara is notoriously difficult to remove. I&#x27;ve tried several different products, and even baby oil followed by a soap and water rinse, but nothing did the trick. Wish I could say Fresh Effects did better, but sadly, no. When I woke up, there was the same gray shadow under my eyes that the other products all left. Fresh Effects works well for other things like eye shadow and liner and eyebrow filler, however, and the scent is light and clean. Maybe I should just try a different mascara....</li>
    <li> They seem like something good as a temporary fix. Like, I don&#x27;t have time to wash my face (such as going to the gym, or while traveling)--so I can quickly wipe stuff off. It is also nice to use for the eye make up that is hard to get off. They weren&#x27;t perfect for getting say, mascara off--but they do help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like how they left my skin feeling though, slightly sticky.</li>
    <li> After trying the Olay Fresh Effects Make-up Removal Wet Cloths I have mixed feelings. I typically use Clinque make remover to clean my face, but am open to trying new things. The Olay wipes do a good job of cleaning your face at the end of the day and did not break my skin out in anyway. It also did a pretty good job on removing my waterproof mascara. The packaging makes it handy for travel however my concern is that unless you travel often they will dry out before you are able to use them. The sticker closure didn&#x27;t seem to close very tight after 4 days of use.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Olay products, but I&#x27;ve always used Neutrogena&#x27;s make-up removal wipes. These are essentially the same price, work great on sensitive skin, and have a great smell. I am genuinely pleased. If you&#x27;ve been hesitant to try them because of sensitive skin issues, have no fear. If I don&#x27;t get a rash from them, I doubt anyone could.</li>
    <li> I normally use only fragrance free skin care products, but I am a sucker for anything with the scent of honey suckle. Breaking my own rules, I took a chance with these Olay Fresh Effects make up removal wipes. So far, so good. Three days of twice a day use and I haven&#x27;t had any break outs or skin irritation. The wipes are really soft and feel nice against the skin and that honey suckle smell is a soft, fairly subtle scent. The package is small and would easily fit in a handbag or your travel kit, but the actual wipes generously unfold to almost half the size of a paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the wipes to be very effective at removing grime from the horse barn after my usual morning routine of cleaning stalls, feeding six horses and riding - my face ends up with a layer of dust, hay partical dirt, horse dirt and sweat. I do light make up later depending on what I have on my schedule. So far, these wipes have done a good job of removing a mineral foundation, light blush and powder.</li>
    <li> The Olay makeup removal cloths work well enough but do require some effort to remove mascara. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and had to vigorously rub my face to get all the makeup removed, but the Olay cloths do a better job than others I&#x27;ve tried. The Olay cloths still don&#x27;t completely remove my mascara with one or two swipes, but they get most of it off. The smell is wonderful and the moisturizer is kind to my skin without irritating it.</li>
    <li> It seems to take my makeup off, but then I don&#x27;t wear theater grade makeup, just powder, eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara. My biggest problem was mascara. Even after washing my face with a gel cleaner or Noxema, I would get mascara all over the towel. These cloths almost work as a wet towel and your face dries so quickly, you don&#x27;t need to towel off. What worries me is if I don&#x27;t seal it back tightly, the cloths will dry out and become useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later: Since I wrote this review, I have become addicted to these things and reordered them four times and added more stars. I love not having to wash my face in the winter. The faucet water takes too long to warm up, I inevitably get some on my pajamas, and the mascara never completely comes off. These solve all those problems. Just reseal the package carefully because the last few wipes will be dried out, although I revived them with a little water.</li>
    <li> These make up remover cloths really work well. They are soft and just moist enough to thoroughly remove all your makeup. They really take off eye makeup and mascara well.</li>
    <li> These make-up remover wet cloths are just ok in my book.  I use make-up remover towellettes every single night.  I have used all major brands, as well as drugstore brands as well.  While these smell really nice, I find the fragrance to be quite overwhelming, as well as the fact that when I removed my eye makeup, i felt my eyes slightly burning from these wet cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That may just be personal preference, but I feel as though fragrance-free is better for skin overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found these to be very thin and my face did not feel 100% clean as it usually does after using other brands of make-up remover wipes.</li>
    <li> These are the best of this type of product I have ever tried.  The lotion is clean and leaves no residue, and they smell fresh and clean.  All makeup is removed with one towelette, as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works better then my store brand removal cloths plus it is the same price. Very easy to remove almost all eye make-up as well as moisturizing my skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave me oily like Almay brands do and also leaves me skin feeling very clean. This cloth reminds me of the neutrogena cloths but at half the price. I have very sensitive skin and can get picky when it comes to removers because some can be too oily and others dry out your skin. Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects Everything Off Deluxe Make-Up Removal Wet Cloths does the job it was made for while be gentle on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for the price and how well these works I have to suggest them to anyone looking for a more affordable make-up removal cloths.</li>
    <li> I have a dual life-style: During the day, I run a landscape company and am \\&quot;One of the Boys.\\&quot; I wear NO make-up or scent, as the sheer amount of dirt and debris that coats me at the end of the day, makes any attempt to be feminine a lost cause. My \\&quot;other\\&quot; self is complete \\&quot;Girly-Girl\\&quot;, which I&#x27;m sure is a reaction to dressing as and working with men all day long. So, that part of me is completely into the \\&quot;whole package\\&quot; of full make-up and whatever scent I&#x27;m in the mood to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although these wipes are designed for taking off make-up, I plan on using them to TAKE OFF FILTH! The package pictured is not what was sent to me: mine is almost identical to a 50 count package of Kraft Singles Cheese, which I like as it&#x27;s much smaller and can tuck into my work bag easier than a rectangle. As a consequence of my filthy job, I end up washing my face 5-20 times per day (depending upon temp and dirt), so by the end of the day, my face is chapped and dried out. I began using this wipe after my LAST job-related face washing of the day and \\&quot;Oh, What a difference a little care will do for the soul!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light scent that is ambiguous \\&quot;floral\\&quot;; since I work with plants all day long, it absolutely does NOT smell like jasmine, but it does have a pleasant odor. As to \\&quot;white tea\\&quot;...I&#x27;m clueless as to WHAT that is supposed to smell like. The wipes themselves are very, very strong and they last an extreme amount of time: I was able to completely wipe off my face, behind my ears, my entire neck from front to back AND my hands...and that darn wipe STILL had moisture in it! I finally offered it to one of my more progressive male employees to use up and he also got a full wipe&#x27;s worth of use from ONE towel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a softness to my skin that it was applied to, as if there was a lotion in the wipe. Nice touch. The scent dies down to almost nothing after a couple of minutes but again, I never found it bad to begin with. At .02 cents per wipe, I can absolutely afford this indulgence at the end of a long, dirty day and plan on keeping these in my truck all the time. My use of these wipes may not be what Olay intended, but they&#x27;ll have a repeat customer for the long term with how I intend to use these...and isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about? :Dbsolutely afford this indulgence at the end of a long, dirty day and plan on keeping these in my truck all the time. My use of these wipes may not be what Olay intended, but they&#x27;ll have a repeat customer for the long term with how I intend to use these...and isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about? :D</li>
    <li> As a makeup remover, this is amazing. I washed my face with my usual Novema before bed and in the morning, used one of these wipes and it took makeup off my eyes that I didn&#x27;t even realize was still there. So thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell and feel is nice. The cloths are adequately moisturized--not too wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging in my case was a tad flawed. It seemed the first cloth was stuck in the &amp;#34;seam&amp;#34; at the end that keeps the package closed. I had to really tear it to get the cloth out and then had to put packing tape on the rip to keep the cloths from drying out. Never had that happen with these packaged face towels before and pretty sure it was a fluke thing.</li>
    <li> These wipes are for geared for makeup removal, and they work fairly well for that purpose. They are a good size, and there is a decent amount of wetness to them, although there could be just a tad more moisture in my opinion. For no makeup, or just light makeup, one wipe will effectively clean your face. For full makeup (foundation, eye-shadow, etc), it will definitely take two wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends toward dryness, and these wipes leave my face a bit sticky, as well as somewhat drier than with my regular face cleanser. I find I need an extra bit a moisturizer afterwards. They have a light pleasant scent but do smell a bit like alcohol, even though I could not find the word &#x27;alcohol&#x27; in the ingredients. Also, I&#x27;m not excited about the propylene glycol in the ingredients; but since these are not an everyday face cleanser for me I can use them one in awhile without worrying about it too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, although these do not perform as well as water &amp; a good face cleanser, they do serve my purposes....an occasional convenience when needing a face cleaning substitute.</li>
    <li> I just wasn&#x27;t blown away by this product.  Olay in general has great products, but this one is a lot like all the other make-up remover cloths I have used - yes, it takes SOME of the makeup off, but not all.  And because I have sensitive skin, this one (like so many others) is just too harsh for me - makes my skin red and burning after... and I still don&#x27;t feel clean.  Even the mascara only came half-way off.. so this is just a fail for me.  Only pro - it smells good... but I will be sticking to eye makeup remover for my mascara and good &#x27;ole soap and water for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used the Olay Fresh Effects oil-free lotion in the past and thought it was good - lightweight and not too heavy. These wipes are only OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do remove all makeup, including waterproof mascara, with no issue. However, they are very irritating to my eyes as they do so, and I did have to scrub pretty hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that I&#x27;m lazy about makeup removal at night, though I do generally only wear mascara and powder. I was hoping these would be an easy solution to that laziness - swipe and take care of it better than I usually do. But the stinging sensation they produce make it so that I don&#x27;t want to use them at all. They are very smooth, so I don&#x27;t get the feeling that I do with other wipes of actually cleansing my pores. Add that to the irritation, and that&#x27;s it for me. I would rather lather up and not have my eyes hurt, with the benefit of actually feeling clean overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend these.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and have no bad reaction to these wipes.  I am loving them.  They are pre-moistened and have honeysuckle and white tea in them.  Usually scents will bother me as well, but not these!  I am seriously amazed.  The wipes work great to get off all of my makeup making it easier to cleanse my face afterwards.  My waterproof mascara even comes off with these wipes, no more raccoon eyes!</li>
    <li> I like these wipes. Usually wipes don&#x27;t remove my makeup well enough, but these do. They remove waterproof mascara too, which is what I always need. My only critique is that they are too small and there are only 25 in a pack. Not a good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of almost everything Olay makes for many years.  These do take off every bit of stubborn eye makeup along with my foundation and blush.  They leave my face feeling clean and soft, without leaving behind any trace of a film as some facial cleansers do.  I love these and find them to be so convenient, for times when I simply want to grab a cloth and get my makeup off as easily and quickly as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t leave my makeup on when I come home at all.  I like to feel clean facial skin, and these make it fast and easy to have that feeling without water and cleanser.  I also love these for traveling when I want to have a washed face but it isn&#x27;t convenient to locate a restroom.  Also after exercise these are nice to have.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands of wet facial cloths and like these the best of any I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of make-up removal wipes, and these are by far the best that I have come across! I am falling in love with their whole Fresh Effects line. I was starting to have really bad adult acne problems, which was really frustrating since I had never had issues with acne before, so I was trying everything! For some reason, using these make-up removers helps with keeping my acne under control. Along with a regiment that I have put together, I fee like my old self again. I still get some flare ups every now and then, but they are the deep painful ones anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I have with them is that because I have slightly sensitive skin, I noticed that some areas of my face would be a little more tender after using the wipes, so I just wouldn&#x27;t go over those areas too much with them. I have also had problems finding them in the store as well. Either the store doesn&#x27;t sell them, or they are just out of stock.</li>
    <li> LOVE these Make-Up Removal Cloths! They have a wonderful scented smell and they actually get the eyeliner and mascara off easily.  The only thing that should be fixed is the price.  I think for only 25 wipes, the price should be a little lower.  If they want to keep this price, I do think they need to boost it to at least 50 wipes per pack. Otherwise this is a great make-up removal solution!</li>
    <li> These are great for cleaning off makeup at the end of the day.  They are not heavily scented although they have a nice clean scent to them.  They removed a substantial amount of makeup without drying out my face.  I even washed my face with a cleanser and this got more after that so I would say they work very well.  My only complaint is the packaging.  I&#x27;m afraid they will all dry out before I use the whole package.  These would be great for travel or times you don&#x27;t have want to mess with soap and water. Overall, these are highly recommended.</li>
    <li> To test these out I put on a full face of makeup!  I used liquid foundation, powder, blush, eyeliner, eye shadow, mascara, lip liner and lipstick.  With one cloth I was able to wipe it all off.  Yes it took a few wipes and I used every inch of the cloth but it did remove it all.  I even used a second one to see if would pick up any more makeup and nothing was there!  I love using these types of make up removers while I travel and at the gym.  I didn&#x27;t experience any break outs or other side effects (like dry skin) after I used these.  The only thing that would probably make these better is if they were unscented and for people with sensitive skin. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These wet cloths left my face clean and smooth, feeling similar to a fresh wash. I think it&#x27;s important to note that I wear very light makeup (no foundation, little powder) and my mascara is not waterproof - so my face is easy to wipe clean. My skin is nice and matte (not oily at all) after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great to have on hand.</li>
    <li> The small removal cloths do an okay job for what they are, but do not expect miracles. The packing is rather flimsy and the reseal function only works marginally well. Once upon a time Olay was a premium brand, but today they are in every big box discount store.</li>
    <li> Horrible experience with these wipes. I am a skin buff along with being a makeup artist when sometimes a makeup wipe is an easy to cleanup. I love the smell and feel of this wipe but the after effects are not fresh but more like a disaster!! I do not have acne, but I woke up with inside zits that were the size of quarters! Very painful and 3 days to go away. I also shared some with a fellow employee who had even a worse reaction. There is an ingredient that is not skin safe and needs to be off the market. I love Olay so I&#x27;m extremely upset!! I have never written a review is any sort till now. I live my skin and to have this reaction and to try and find ways to cover it at work is ridiculous! This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve a 1!!</li>
    <li> My partner and soul mate has tried a good number of make-up removal products in all categories (liquids / lotions / wipes) and the Fresh Effects Everything Off wipes are her favorite so far. She even likes the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; scent (she generally prefers unscented products.) Also, just as reviewer Vawfeona said, she&#x27;s replaced a couple other cosmetic products with those from the Fresh Effects family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says they&#x27;re more durable than any other pad she&#x27;s used, and seem to be more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;: she only needs to use on pad to completely clean her face (in fairness, she&#x27;s not a heavy maker-upper!)  So, they offer better value than their price might suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great product from the folks at Olay!</li>
    <li> I have cystic hormonal acne which I am very embarrassed, and have to be really careful about. Anything flares up my face, and I do use heavy foundation to cover it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloths are pre-moistened and come in a resealable pack- the first cloth is a bit dry but the middle cloths are really pre-moistened while the last cloths are a bit dry again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clothes are pretty good at removing foundation (I use liquid foundation since they are more acne-friendly than heavy powder, with a concealer on top of the spots to finish the job). It removes foundation and concealers very well. Mascara is a bit of a problem but it does remove it. I use both drugstore (NYX, Covergirl) as well as higher end stuff (Bobbi Brown, Urban Decay), and these cloths are pretty good for basic &amp;#34;natural makeup faces&amp;#34; (foundation, concealer, brush, a bit of eyeshadadow), though you need 2 cloths to remove &amp;#34;glamorous&amp;#34; makeup looks (especially if you have a smokey eye and you used a primer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne has NOT increased because of these cloths which I am happy about :) If you suffer from acne or just have sensitive skin, my technique is to to dampen your face with the cloths, as opposed to rubbing. Rubbing can irritate the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can leave your face feeling dry though. If you have acne and your face feels super dry, it can overstimulate the sebum glands to make more oil, so be sure to use a moisturizer when you&#x27;re done.  Especially in the winter, when skin can dry out really easily. I use a oil free moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like these cloths and would recommend them :)</li>
    <li> My granddaughters favorite thing to do is play spa. She applies under eye cover-up for the blue , some green stick product to hide the numerous brown spots on my face, a yellow cream to hide the redden tip of my nose and then every sort of sparkle eye shadow and cheek highlighter. By the time she is finished, I am slathered in much more face product then you would ever wear on a daily basis. We used these wipes to clean it all up. They work just fine on all of the above. We did not apply mascara. I like that my sensitive, dry skin is not worsened by the ingredients in the wet cloths. I also have a full cabinet of Olay lotions and they are all wonderful. Keeps my bathroom hand towels from being ruined on our once a week spa treatment days.</li>
    <li> These Olay make-up remover cloths are a great way to ge rid of all your make up quickly and easily. I can remove a face full of makeup (including mascara) with one large cloth. They have just the right amount of moisture and the resealable bag makes it easy to keep them on me when I travel. I do still like to use my regular cleanser afterwards, though. While these are great for removing makeup, they aren&#x27;t going to give me any skin care benefits that my cleanser does. My only other &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is that they are scented and I don&#x27;t like using anything with fragrance on my face. Other than that, they are a great product for the job they are intended for.</li>
    <li> I like cleansing towels as I am often too lazy to get up and wash my face. This one is effective at makeup removal and cleansing. It has a nice light fresh  scent that dissipates quickly. I find it a little drying for my combination skin,though.&lt;br /&gt;It is not cost efficient at about  20 cents per sheet.  For this reason I will probably stick with the target store brand I currently use that costs about 4 cents per sheet with excellent results.</li>
