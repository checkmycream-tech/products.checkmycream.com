### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>With this wig I&#x27;m using it for a shiro cosplay from deadman wonderland and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>Excellent value!</li>
      <li>The length is perfect, and the fiber is great.</li>
      <li>Wig was perfect to handle and I loved how it came with a wig cap.</li>
      <li>Feels amazing and it fits perfect.</li>
      <li>It comes in very nice, but tangles as soon as you try to put it on.</li>
      <li>This is easily the best wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased online.</li>
      <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t say you can use heat products with it, I found that a hair dryer kept at a fair distance as I styled it</li>
      <li>Very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a spectacular wig for the price.</li>
      <li>Tangles easily, take good care of it.</li>
      <li>It does tangle easily though so you&#x27;ll need to use some wig detangle and you will need to take good care of it.</li>
      <li>I love mapofbeauty wigs because they are really cheap and are good quality</li>
      <li>Soooo glad I got it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>I would buy it again though, but this time I would be better prepared to take care of it.</li>
      <li>All in all though for the price I paid for it I am pleased with it.</li>
      <li>It came in well before the original estimated arrival time too!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re fun to style and fitsb nice and snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product gets tangled way too easy.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s what I love about ordering things from this site, most all of them come in super early and super good quality.</li>
      <li>I love this wig and HIGHLY suggest it!!!</li>
      <li>Accurate color, accurate length.</li>
      <li>Very long and beautiful wig.</li>
      <li>Basically it works nicely for derping around, find another wig if you&#x27;re going for realistic cosplay.</li>
      <li>Not disappointed, AT all.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my female Kaneki Cosplay and it&#x27;s perfect and super soft too.</li>
      <li>If it was thicker, it would look even more real.</li>
      <li>The person who was wearing it for a convention costume actually liked the fit of the single wig and we didn&#x27;t have to sew them.</li>
      <li>the tracks are not straight or in any good arrangement.</li>
      <li>Long, beautiful, incredibly soft.</li>
      <li>The fibers are indeed very soft and easy to brush.</li>
      <li>Hair knots up very easy ..couldn&#x27;t use it on second day.</li>
      <li>The wig is exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>Item arrived exactly as it was described.</li>
      <li>the only reason i give it a second star is because the fibers are of good quality, though the fringe/bangs are shorter than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wig looked exactly as it did in the picture, SUPER soft too.</li>
      <li>Warning, if you&#x27;re going to get this product, have a bottle of wig spray and a wig stand ready for the moment you get it out.</li>
      <li>What I received was actually better than expected.</li>
      <li>I soaked the whole wig in a water/fabric softener mix overnight to soften it up and take some of the sheen out, and also make it easier to comb out the tangles.</li>
      <li>the wig doesn&#x27;t even fit on a generic wig head.</li>
      <li>It feels like real hair.</li>
      <li>the moment I put it on it tangled so much</li>
      <li>Like jeez, I felt it and couldn&#x27;t stop petting my own head with it on for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>my first serious cosplaying wig (I was Hatsune Miku c:) as always, the price is reasonable and good with tight budgets.</li>
      <li>, it was just too thin, if it was thicker it would have been better and it tangles really easily,</li>
      <li>This wig is decent.</li>
      <li>it is very soft.</li>
      <li>The quality is very good, but as usual, straight wigs are difficult to keep from tangling, so we carried a brush to work on it during the day and keep the tangles out.</li>
      <li>The color is true, the strands of hair are thick and don&#x27;t tangle much, and the netting doesn&#x27;t show when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
      <li>I love the brand because their wigs are always so soft and don&#x27;t shine like those cheap ugly ones people get from target.</li>
      <li>It came way earlier than expected, and was exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>but I just wish the longer wigs were more fuller instead of thin.</li>

<li> The wig is a little thin at the top</li>
<li> It is quite thin, but that&#x27;s to be expected with a cheap wig.</li>
<li> So I recommend as soon as you open up your wig, hang it somewhere and spray it with hair oil/anti frizz oil and comb it in weigh a wide tooth comb.</li>
<li> It is a little on the thin side, but as I am going to use this for a cosplay, I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s not too thick or heavy.</li>
<li> but it wasn&#x27;t as I expected it to be</li>
<li> but the main problem is that it&#x27;s way too thin</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re going to wear this for anything other than goofing around I suggest a skin-tone wig cap, otherwise your hair WILL show.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I had to trim it since the ends were very frizzy, although once you cut off the ends</li>
<li> But I was using this in combination with another wig to make a long thin white wizard beard.</li>
<li> I am 5&#x27; and this wig falls midway down my thighs.</li>
<li> It comes down to my Waist, and comes with a wig Cap as pictured.</li>
<li> It was a little thin, but that is to be expected for a wig that isn&#x27;t front laced and that is so long.</li>
<li> only concern is that their wigs (including this one) are a little thin and require lots of maintenance.</li>
<li> the fiber is amazing quality, but the wig is TERRIBLE.</li>
<li> I took this wig out of the bag and in 5 minutes it was a mess of knots that I had to end up throwing it away because I got the wig spray when it was too late.</li>
<li> /&gt;The wefts were thin, I expected that.</li>
<li> or else it would be hard to salvage.</li>
<li> , it was really hard to untangle it, I have another wig which has like a comb in the front so that the wig stays in place while this wig didn&#x27;t have anything to make it stay in place</li>
<li> As I read, the wig was a little thin, I&#x27;d recommend buying two and splicing them together.</li>
<li> May be a bit thin in some parts.</li>
<li> I bought two of these wigs after reading that they were rather thin and planned to splice them together.</li>
<li> it is a sloppy job.</li>
<li> so it was constantly slipping :( ,</li>
<li> Sorry to say this</li>
<li> /&gt;i included pictures to show the missing temple and terrible track arrangement.</li>
<li> This will prevent it from getting tangled and all that annoying stuff.</li>
<li> very disappointed</li>

    <li> This is easily the best wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased online. The color is true, the strands of hair are thick and don&#x27;t tangle much, and the netting doesn&#x27;t show when I&#x27;m wearing it. I love this wig and HIGHLY suggest it!!!</li>
    <li> Map of beauty was where I go it my first serious cosplaying wig (I was Hatsune Miku c:) as always, the price is reasonable and good with tight budgets. I love the brand because their wigs are always so soft and don&#x27;t shine like those cheap ugly ones people get from target. They&#x27;re fun to style and fitsb nice and snug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that their wigs (including this one) are a little thin and require lots of maintenance. The longer do anyway!! So I recommend as soon as you open up your wig, hang it somewhere and spray it with hair oil/anti frizz oil and comb it in weigh a wide tooth comb. Uh, like the ones people use after they shower. This will prevent it from getting tangled and all that annoying stuff.</li>
    <li> the fiber is amazing quality, but the wig is TERRIBLE. It is made of a mesh cap. the tracks are not straight or in any good arrangement. the wig doesn&#x27;t even fit on a generic wig head. some parts of the track are not sewn in. it is a sloppy job. there are no temple areas. its just a tiny circle that does not stretch. the only reason i give it a second star is because the fibers are of good quality, though the fringe/bangs are shorter than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i included pictures to show the missing temple and terrible track arrangement.</li>

    <li> Very long and beautiful wig. I can do a lot with it! It does tangle easily though so you&#x27;ll need to use some wig detangle and you will need to take good care of it.</li>
    <li> Long, beautiful, incredibly soft. May be a bit thin in some parts. If it was thicker, it would look even more real. It feels like real hair. Tangles easily, take good care of it. Don&#x27;t let tangles progress or else it would be hard to salvage. Accurate color, accurate length.</li>
    <li> It came way earlier than expected, and was exactly like the picture. Very pleased with it.</li>

    <li> Hair knots up very easy ..couldn&#x27;t use it on second day. very disappointed</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a spectacular wig for the price. What I received was actually better than expected. Yes, it shed hair fiber, but I also was modding it a bit. I soaked the whole wig in a water/fabric softener mix overnight to soften it up and take some of the sheen out, and also make it easier to comb out the tangles. I recommend storing it  braided. Even though it doesn&#x27;t say you can use heat products with it, I found that a hair dryer kept at a fair distance as I styled it help keep the style trained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wefts were thin, I expected that. But I was using this in combination with another wig to make a long thin white wizard beard.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say this but it wasn&#x27;t as I expected it to be, it was just too thin, if it was thicker it would have been better and it tangles really easily, the moment I put it on it tangled so much, it was really hard to untangle it, I have another wig which has like a comb in the front so that the wig stays in place while this wig didn&#x27;t have anything to make it stay in place so it was constantly slipping :( , but the main problem is that it&#x27;s way too thin</li>

Feels amazing and it fits perfect. Soooo glad I got it. It came in well before the original estimated arrival time too! That&#x27;s what I love about ordering things from this site, most all of them come in super early and super good quality. Not disappointed, AT all.</li>
    <li> This product gets tangled way too easy.</li>
    <li> As I read, the wig was a little thin, I&#x27;d recommend buying two and splicing them together. Either I have a really big head, or this is a pretty small wig net, as at the largest setting all around the edges you can see my wig cap and hair. All in all though for the price I paid for it I am pleased with it. The fibers are indeed very soft and easy to brush.</li>
    <li> The wig is exactly as pictured. It is a little on the thin side, but as I am going to use this for a cosplay, I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s not too thick or heavy. It comes down to my Waist, and comes with a wig Cap as pictured.</li>
    <li> Item arrived exactly as it was described. Wig was perfect to handle and I loved how it came with a wig cap.</li>
