      <li>They are so comfortable, you will not know they&#x27;re in place and your hair will look great in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I can probably make this my own.</li>
      <li>It works for my hair and it very easy to use.</li>
      <li>They do curl, and are very comfortable to sleep in</li>
      <li>And very comfortable to sleep in.</li>
      <li>These rollers are okay.</li>
      <li>but I am sure I will find the way.</li>
      <li>Love the concept.  </li>
      <li>The concept was great the execution not so much.</li>
      <li>I may not find them again when I need more.</li>
      <li>hen I just bought more, so I can throw the messed up ones out.</li>
      <li>After all, most of us sleep in satin caps to prevent our hair from drying.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and easy to sleep in.  </li>
      <li>In the morning I have a head full of curls and can style in so many ways.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work well for styling fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Really cheap construction.  </li>
      <li>The satin is too smooth and they did not stay in after curling.</li>
      <li>They are also super comfortable to sleep with..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a full week</li>
      <li>Even after exercising one evening, I simply rolled and prayed it would look good in the morning.  </li>
      <li>I guess that one way to do business is to make these so cheap that you can throw them out regularly and buy more.</li>
      <li>I could make my own satin covered rollers but, as with most things, I would much rather buy them due to convenience.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s very easy to push back into the satin covering.  </li>
      <li>Giving them four stars because I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product, because I have only used them twice, but so far, so good.</li>
      <li>I continue to use these curlers only because I haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
      <li>The first time I used these curlers, the stitching on the ends broke and the wires came out of the satin.</li>
      <li>I bought two orders of these (at different times) and I love the curls and body they give my hair.</li>
      <li>The manufacturers could have easily used a different type of stitching to prevent this.</li>
      <li>Not made real well.</li>
      <li>I guess I expected more.</li>
      <li>you can sleep comfortable, and next day your hair looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Would definitely buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>Although I can get a &#x27;few&#x27; uses out of them, these rollers are very cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>It is the most flimsiest thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased for like 10$. What a waste.</li>
      <li>After opening the bag, noticed right off the seams weren&#x27;t sewn properly and the wires were already poking out of the ends.  </li>
      <li>These curlers work great, but as others have stated, the wire after a few uses pop out of the material and some of the wires have broken.</li>
      <li>and it came out with a much tighter curl than expected.</li>
      <li>I use them when I have to awake extra early for work.</li>
      <li>Also if the wire sticks out a little, looks like it could be easily repaired with some black needle and thread from the dollar store, and you can stitch up the sides in under 5 minutes.</li>

    <li> Although I can get a &#x27;few&#x27; uses out of them, these rollers are very cheaply made.  After opening the bag, noticed right off the seams weren&#x27;t sewn properly and the wires were already poking out of the ends.  Choose a different brand other than these to try.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love the concept.  A little on the cheep side, though.  Some seems coming loose.</li>
    <li> The first time I used these curlers, the stitching on the ends broke and the wires came out of the satin. I didn&#x27;t even get one use out of these because the wires got caught in my hair and the curls were pulled flat when I tried to get them out the next morning. Even if the stitching had not come apart, the foam center of the curlers was completely compressed after one use and has yet to regain its shape. I do not recommend this product. This type of curler has always worked well for me in the past, but these curlers were horrible.</li>
    <li> is a great hair shape tool. you can sleep comfortable, and next day your hair looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to use it, I do not know how!  but I am sure I will find the way.</li>
    <li> I used to hate rollers.  They dry out my hair and made it look horrible.  Whenever I&#x27;d get a curly do from the salon I would have to flat iron it out within 2 days.  I saw these in Walgreen&#x27;s and decided to try them since they were inexpensive.  After all, most of us sleep in satin caps to prevent our hair from drying.  It&#x27;s been a full week and I am still getting compliments on my hair.  Even after exercising one evening, I simply rolled and prayed it would look good in the morning.  It did.  I agree with other comments about the wire coming through.  However, it&#x27;s very easy to push back into the satin covering.  I bend the ends so that they do not poke through again or pull my hair.  I also like these over the traditional rollers with the clip/fastener to hold it in place.  Those rollers leave an indentation in the hair and this product does not.  I was surprised to see the negative reviews.  I find this is a great product.  I took off a star because you do have to manipulate the wires to keep them inside the satin.  I roll each night and cover with my satin cap.  They are so comfortable, you will not know they&#x27;re in place and your hair will look great in the morning.  I&#x27;m buying another pack just because I&#x27;m afraid with the negative reviews I may not find them again when I need more.</li>
    <li> way too tiny for my hair.</li>
    <li> These curlers work great, but as others have stated, the wire after a few uses pop out of the material and some of the wires have broken. I use the curlers every night, so they see very heavy use and the thin wire just can take only so much twisting, which I understand that you probably  need a thin wire for comfort, however the stitching could be better, no problem, I know how to sew and will just stitch it back together.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and easy to sleep in.  Nice curl at a great price.  Would definitely buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great product. It does a very good job with my hair. I bought two packs in order to have enough..I like alot of curls. I part my hair in small sections and add the rollers at night. They are also super comfortable to sleep with..no issues there. In the morning I have a head full of curls and can style in so many ways.</li>
    <li> I continue to use these curlers only because I haven&#x27;t found anything better.  The wires stuck through the fabric cover and tore the fabric open after a couple of nights wearing the rollers.  Really cheap construction.  However, they aren&#x27;t bad to sleep in, which I why I keep them. I&#x27;ve sewed the ends of them all once, but hen I just bought more, so I can throw the messed up ones out. I guess that one way to do business is to make these so cheap that you can throw them out regularly and buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with pillow curlers have used them every night for 10-15 years . My complaint is with the sewing the ends work their way out too soon like in days and the wires will pull your hair. I used to buy goody brand at a local store and they quit stocking them .</li>
    <li> These rollers are okay. I guess I expected more. They do curl, and are very comfortable to sleep in and no there are no marks in the hair. I use them when I have to awake extra early for work. They get the job done. There is one thing I don&#x27;t like is that the fabric appears to be poorly sewn because one of the rollers has a slight tear. I hope that no more are like this, yes I believe in wishful thinking.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product does what it says it will do and that simply curl hair. No miracles here.</li>
    <li> I bought a few soft curlers for natural hair curls, but this is just disappointing. It is the most flimsiest thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased for like 10$. What a waste. This thing will probably only last you several time of uses before it breaks. The display picture is misleading. It looks nothing like it besides the fact that it&#x27;s black. Inside is a small block of foam with a piece of plastic bending stick. I can probably make this my own.</li>
    <li> Great for curly look. And very comfortable to sleep in.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about purchasing these due to the number of negative reviews, but once I went to my local CVS and saw similar rollers for twice the price (and they were in white, which get dirty way too quickly for my liking), I decided to give them a shot. Yes, they do seem a little flimsy, but I think the one and two star ratings are going a little bit overboard; they were under five bucks. Also if the wire sticks out a little, looks like it could be easily repaired with some black needle and thread from the dollar store, and you can stitch up the sides in under 5 minutes. Overall the rollers do what they say and even work on my short hair (my hair comes to my chin). I can see them working for a variety of hair lengths, because the inside of the roller is spongy, allowing you to tightly roll your hair (short hair) or loosely wrap your hair around it (longer hair). Giving them four stars because I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product, because I have only used them twice, but so far, so good.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for styling fine hair.  The satin is too smooth and they did not stay in after curling.</li>
    <li> I bought two orders of these (at different times) and I love the curls and body they give my hair. My only problem is after one of two times used, the wires start poking through the satin seam. The manufacturers could have easily used a different type of stitching to prevent this. I hope they read their Amazon reviews and improve on the seams. I could make my own satin covered rollers but, as with most things, I would much rather buy them due to convenience.</li>
    <li> I used them on wet hair and it came out with a much tighter curl than expected. They are soft though, but I still had a difficult time sleeping in them.</li>
    <li> These rollers work amazingly! I was so happy with the price as well as the product. I had no problem recieveing the product and it was in perfect condition. It is so nice to be able to get the perfect curls without having to use and heat or product in my hair at all!</li>
    <li> They work but, unfortunately, they don&#x27;t last long due to the quality of the materials used, and the poor workmanship.</li>
    <li> Not made real well. The concept was great the execution not so much. These would be awesome item to any girls beauty supplies if the came in more sizes and were sewn better.</li>
    <li> These rollers are a great way to protect and style the hair. I have chemically relaxed medium/fine hair. It works for my hair and it very easy to use. I&#x27;ve seen it for $2 or $3 after i purchased for $8.</li>
    <li> Curlers just slid out of hair. The wire inside the curlers poked thru the silk fabric while twisting them into hair.</li>
