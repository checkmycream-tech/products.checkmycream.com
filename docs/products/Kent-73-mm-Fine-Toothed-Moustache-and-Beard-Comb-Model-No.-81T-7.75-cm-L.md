<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this comb on my last deployment while I grew an absurdly out-of-regulations moustache. I had been using a cheap plastic molded moustache comb, but it was quite painful on the upper lip. I had my reservations about the wonders this comb would do for me, but since it was only a few bucks, I took the chance. I&#x27;m glad I did. The teeth are both fine and soft, so it grooms neatly while also giving your upper lip the direct skin contact it needs without the sharp clawing sensation of a cheap comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re even considering buying a moustache comb, look no further. If you&#x27;re reading this review, you must be considering buying a moustache comb. What are you waiting for? Buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out Firehouse Moustache Wax while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
    <li> Well made and purpose suited.</li>
    <li> My husband might like this BUT it is an absolute waste of 6.99! It is the size of your thumb. I thought 73mm was some beard lingo for something. But I wouldn&#x27;t have cared about the size if it wasn&#x27;t 6.99. Thank god for free prime shipping. Should be like 3 bucks. Or please write in the title in inches or something.  Very deceiving</li>
    <li> Great little comb. It is very small, but that is not necessarily a problem. It works very well for my beard, and coupled with a little oil does a great job.</li>
    <li> This is nothing like other combs.. just as soon as you hold it in your hand you can tell it is of great quality.. some people complain about the size.. to me it&#x27;s perfect it goes in my pocket and I use it when I need it.. I just use it for my moustache so it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> This Comb is a good size for a mustache, helps with applying wax and reshaping to your style.</li>
    <li> as expected, good value</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beefy enough to handle combing in the stiffest wax.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought a beard/moustache comb would elicit a Wow??? This comb is so smooth at the ends of the teeth, it feels like a fingertip against your face. This is so worth the money...no more scratching combs for my beard and moustache, I am a Kent fan for life!</li>
    <li> Who would of thought this little guy would make such a difference. You ordered a comb? Well get ready for the smoothest rake of pleasure dividing your beard hairs like a stick through sand. Heard it even fits in your wallet. Haven&#x27;t tried it for the fear of breaking my glorious comb. Cheers.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really no reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5/5 stars, but whatever. This comb is pretty awesome. It&#x27;s not made of cheap quality, it doesn&#x27;t get caught, scratch or pull like some I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s durable and well crafted. I once lost one, so I ordered two more. I would order again, and I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> If all you want to do is comb your mustache, this is a great comb. However, if you want to use it for a beard of any real length, it is inadequately small.</li>
    <li> I thought that this might be an item for my travel kit, but this comb is too small for grooming.  It is strictly a novelty item.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a smurf or dwarf.  Way smaller than I thought it would be. My mistake for not paying attention to the size in the details.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend of mine.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> The comb works. It does exactly what you would expect a comb to do, and it does it well enough.</li>
    <li> bought this for my beard. small enough to fit in your pocket and sturdy enough to fit in your wallet.</li>
    <li> Great mustache comb!!  It is too small to be a full beard comb, but works very nicely for my mustache.  I think I will probably end up going to a longer fold up one as this is just too small for my beard. It is very slightly finer than a regular ace hard rubber comb and much smoother, better quality.  Probably worth the money, but it is very small, almost doll comb size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to break it by leaving it in my pocket, it seems very sturdy and is hardly noticeable when I pull it out to straighten out my mustache as it is so small in the hand.</li>
    <li> Wonderful small comb.  Yes, its tiny but functions as designed to comb my beard and mustache.  I would highly recommend this for someone growing out a beard that needs it to still look &amp;#34;kept&amp;#34; for a professional work environment.</li>
    <li> Fits in my wallet. Solid build and feel. Never snags. Manly men don&#x27;t need long reviews and if you have enough beard to shop for a beard comb you&#x27;re a manly man. Buy this if you&#x27;re man enough.</li>
    <li> Read the description carefully. This thing is so small you can barely comb a mustache.</li>
    <li> Great size comb, perfect for the mustache.</li>
    <li> This thing is the Ferrari of facial care. If I lose it, I will immediately replace it.</li>
    <li> good comb, but much smaller than I expected. I get the fact that a beard/mustache comb should be smaller than its head hair counterpart, but this is a little extreme IMO.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get this out of the way: This is a small comb, suited for a groomed beard or mustache. If you&#x27;re part-way to being an extra on Duck Dynasty, this will not be big enough. In fact, if you have daughters, they may mistake it for a Barbie comb and begin using it as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 5 stars? It is compact enough to fit in a wallet or EDC case, which means I can quickly set my whiskers straight. If you have a well-groomed beard (and would like to keep it that way), this is the portable tool for you.</li>
    <li> It is ideally suited for combing mustaches.</li>
    <li> This is a nice sturdy mustache comb.  It is a little on the thick side so it would be better for an established beard/mustache.</li>
    <li> When I open the package I just laughted. I felt like Norm MacDonald&#x27;s Burt Reynolds &amp;#34;big hat&amp;#34; character from SNL&#x27;s Celebrity Jeopardy. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s funny because it&#x27;s ah, smaller than, ah.. [ clears throat ] ..you know, a normal comb.&amp;#34; Not nearly as useful as I had expected based on other reviews. I have a full, lucious beard and was really hoping for something substantial being called a beard comb and all. I get it; the description clearly states 73mm but it&#x27;s a beard comb. I expect it to work on a beard, not some pre-teen stubble.</li>
    <li> This thing is tiny I thought it was going to be bigger. Does a great job with a mustache, not so much on a full on grizzly beast of a beard.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like it but its not the comb&#x27;s fault. My husband decided to grow a beard out of spite and now has this huge thick beard that normally he wouldve shaved but everyone compliments him on it so it seems to be staying. He really likes the comb and uses it so I guess the comb is good. Also surprised the comb is still around since my husband is kinda like a gnarly giant oaf that breaks everything and I do mean EVERYTHING! He has broken my Lexus smart key probably a good 10-12 times so now he isnt even allowed to drive my car. He broke our daughter&#x27;s Leappad trying to charge it. Dude is a demolisher but this tiny comb seems to have withstood him so far.</li>
    <li> This was part of a slew of many moustache/beard gifts for a budding beard/handlebar grower. I was a little surprised at the size of this when it came, it looks like something a squirrel would use, but Hubs says it is supposed to be that size and he loves it. He used to use those small cheap black plastic 2/$1 drugstore combs and he confirms this way, way better and even fits in his wallet so he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about breaking it. Thumbs up to the fancy little comb, you are Superbeast approved.</li>
    <li> Great idea and it makes you feel like a giant !</li>
    <li> This thing is 100% worthless. I bet It couldn&#x27;t even comb my back hair never mind my facial hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great mustache comb for the average &#x27;stache but might be a bit too small and fine in the tooth for an extra large one. The quality is top notch.</li>
    <li> Got the comb and I stroke my beard daily!!!!! Or even hourly!!!  Great comb, perfect size and price.  Get one too!!</li>
    <li> Gift-recipient was very happy with product</li>
    <li> It has a nice, solid feel to it. It&#x27;s what I expected, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it, but $7 for a tiny comb still feels a bit steep.</li>
    <li> Loved this little comb, i kept it on the change pocket in my levis. Thing is that its so small like a thumb that i lost it within avweek. Great comb thoe, its fine toothed so it worked great with my beard and mustache.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a fun little gift for my husband. I&#x27;d give it five stars if it didn&#x27;t have gold printing all over one side. I&#x27;m not fond of that aspect, but the comb itself does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> The only thing against this comb is it is too easy to loose.  Finally figured out a way to keep track of it.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I think this is over-priced but my son recently grew a beard and loves this little comb!</li>
    <li> This was BS I don&#x27;t recall seeing that it was only a inch and a half long. If it where a 6 inch comb it would be perfect but this was definitely not worth the $8 :(</li>
    <li> For the depth of my beard, this comb falls very short of satisfaction. It&#x27;s smaller than I had thought and the depth of the teeth do very little justice combing through the forest on my face. Maybe for some smaller, daintier mustachios this might do the trick - but men of flannel and the forest take heed.</li>
    <li> It was my fault for not looking at the dimensions. But for $12 i was expecting it to be bigger. Its tiny!! My husband is 6&#x27;8 so even holding the tiny comb is awkward. Its supposed to be for a beard, not a toy doll. Not pleased.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and very good.  Price was right too!</li>
    <li> I am writing a review for a comb. Seems silly, right? All combs are the same, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a Kent Comb is like the difference between using a Bic Ballpoint Pen and a Mont Blanc Fountain pen. They will both get the job done, but they are not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First you pull it out of the package and the weight surprises you, it&#x27;s not heavy but it has a heft to it that you didn&#x27;t expect. You admire the quality of materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you look at it, you can tell it is hand made and hand finished, only not in a bad way. The lack of injection molded burrs and total lack of a seam make you smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you run the comb through your beard and mustache, the feeling is akin to a hot butter-knife through butter. It doesn&#x27;t scratch or bite at your skin, more of a massage than a combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You slip the comb in your pocket, proud of yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, you walk to the bedside table and pick up the two cheap Ace combs you picked up at the local big box store before you knew better and you throw them in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are now a Kent Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You order two more, just because.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this comb, but i lost mine so im gonna have to get another one soon.</li>
    <li> The size of this thing is obnoxiously small.  I gave it 2 stars for the quality of the comb.  I bought the larger one and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> It does its job and fits in my wallet</li>
    <li> Very nice and thick hearty comb. Little pricey but when received the price does not seem to bother. Would suggest for a NICE comb this is it. I will suggest if you are looking for a more moderately priced comb that desighn aids in styling a bit more than this is the \\&quot;Colonel Ichabod\\&quot; comb. Dont be fooled by the price on this one either![[ASIN:B000KP5IT8 Colonel Ichabod Conk Mini Moustache Comb]]</li>
    <li> What is this, a comb for a Ken doll? This thing is the size of a silver dollar. Get the one that flips like a folding knife. This is so tiny you&#x27;ll lose it after combing one beard hair at a time.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly love this</li>
    <li> Great little mustache comb. I grew out my beard for over a year, and this little guy was a life saver. The only thing I would suggest thinking about is having it on your key chain. Mine came with a little key chain hole on the bottom of the handle. Comb is a great size, as big as a key. Good quality, I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year, and its still going strong. I actually have two of them. The one on my key chain, and the other one that came without the hole in it I keep in the bathroom at home. IF you have a mustache that is in need of combing, I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Quality product great for use in trimming</li>
    <li> GOT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND HIS BEARD IS SO WIREY. I JUST WISH HE WOULD USE IT MORE.</li>
    <li> Without fear of hyperbole I can say that this is the best mustache comb I have ever owned.It is small, but not so tiny that it is difficult to control and the teeth are cut, not molded and that makes a huge difference in terms of how it handles the hair. I got this one to put in my wallet, but I&#x27;ll soon be ordering another for home.&lt;br /&gt;Hey Amazon! I wish I could add a photo of my mustache!</li>
    <li> My husband ADORES this comb. He carries it around with him everywhere. He will even bring it on car rides and comb his beard as we are driving!! It is very tiny so make so you keep track of it. Great beard comb though, makes my husbands beard soft and fluffy....although I am not sure if he would agree with me using those terms :-)</li>
    <li> I knew it was gonna be small, I just didn&#x27;t realize it was gonna be this small.... There should be hand holding it to show the size difference. It&#x27;s more of a mustache comb than a beard comb</li>
    <li> a little small, but not surprised, works great on my mustache/beard.</li>
    <li> Very well made comb for mustache of all size.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my mustache and beard grooming. I carry it every day in my pocket. It is truly tiny... so small that it was a shock to me when I opened it up. But it&#x27;s perfect for getting to the mustache right up under my nose without interfering with the rest of the hair growing on my face. I used it on my beard as well, before I bought the Slim Jim comb, also made by Kent. The teeth on both combs are about the same length, but the Slim Jim is straight and the length of a normal pocket comb. I ended up buying it because this comb was just a little too short to make it easy to comb through my entire beard. I now carry both with me every day and haven&#x27;t looked back. High quality all the way. The cost put me off at first, but I won&#x27;t buy another one of these unless I lose mine, so it ends up being cheap in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful! It&#x27;s very easy to lose this. I pulled it out of my pocket along with my keys one day and thought it was long gone. By sheer luck, I found it in the grass the next day outside my daughter&#x27;s daycare, unharmed. Still, I have to be extra careful now not to lose it. They make an all-black version (called the Movember) that looks the same, except it has a hole in the handle. I assume this is for attaching to a keyring or something similar. This is a good idea, and I may end up drilling a small hole in mine for this purpose at some point. The Movember is available on the Kent Brushes website, but I haven&#x27;t seen it for sale on Amazon. It&#x27;s priced quite a bit higher because they donate a portion of the purchase to a charity.</li>
    <li> Awesome little comb. I carry it around everyday. Brushing you&#x27;re beard is very important and so does looking good. Buy this item, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Bought it as part of a gift. He was very happy with the comb.</li>
    <li> My husband likes the comb but it&#x27;s a bit small for him</li>
    <li> This thing is PERFECT for grooming your mustache and sideburns. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good choice for a beard, but I&#x27;d definitely go with Kent for any comb!</li>
    <li> Might be a bit too small - but perfect for &#x27;short&#x27; beard use</li>
    <li> So little you&#x27;ll have to put it somewhere safe so you don&#x27;t lose it!</li>
    <li> Small little beard comb perfect to keep in back pocket. 2nd one purchased lost first one had to get it again. Fast shipping by seller</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected....look at a tape measure to see just how small 73mm is....still, it works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Nice comb it is small but useful.</li>
    <li> Excellent comb, helps make trimming my goatee much easier.  Kent is a world leader in combs and brushes, this item is highly indicative of this quality. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Handy dandy beard make fancy</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy well designed compact comb. Works very well.</li>
    <li> My mustache looks immaculate thanks to this perfectly crafted tiny comb.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really small, we should have paid attention and see the size before order. Looks like a Barbie comb, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a handsome, durable little comb that&#x27;s done a fantastic job keeping my stache and soup catcher in order.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very small.  Read the dimensions.</li>
    <li> Small but sturdy moustache comb. It&#x27;s small enough to fit inside the key pocket on a pair of jeans, and yet durable enough to withstand constant use. The fine toothed design allows for even distribution of wax through my moustache, and is sturdy enough to work even the firmest wax through without bending at all. All in all, this is the best moustache comb I have owned.</li>
    <li> Great little Beard comb! Very nice quality (I think it&#x27;s tortoise shell). Very small and convenient. I use it to comb my chops too. And my regular hair cause it&#x27;s so handy.</li>
    <li> This.is seriously  the worst f n beard comb I&#x27;ve bought thus far . I&#x27;m too embarrassed to take a pic of it. I should have read the reviews lol this looks like a mustache comb . So freak in tiny bro lol so sad. 5  months into my grow. What am I going to to WITH THISSSSS BRUHHHH!!!! Lol 1 star for beard comb. 4 stars for mustache comb. I&#x27;m about to give this away on Craig&#x27;s list ctfu. Didn&#x27;t sleep for 2 days waiting for this (prime) lol never again!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these things, but they are so small I keep losing &#x27;em! My only criticism is that they slip out of my wallet and I have to rebuy. :p</li>
    <li> All around great mustache comb!</li>
    <li> Strong comb! I keep it in my back pocket with a hair comb, and they&#x27;ve withstood a lot of pressure from sitting. Obviously, it&#x27;s sometimes easy to misplace, but that goes without saying.</li>
    <li> Great Quality moustache comb. Well worth the cost compared to cheaper combs</li>
    <li> Perfect for beards. Buying one for every man in my life for No-Shave-November.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used cheap little combs from the local drug store. But I figured what the hey...if I don&#x27;t like it, my kid can use it as a comb for her little ponies. Now we fight to see who gets to use it. Works really well on my beard; works really well on my toddler&#x27;s little ponies. I should probably just order another one for her.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this product. He doesn&#x27;t experience many tangles when using this compared to the little pocket comb he used to use.</li>
    <li> almost too small to really use, prefer a regular sized comb</li>
    <li> I bought the coarse and fine toothed comb as well as this fine toothed comb.  If you have never used a handmade, sawn comb, you are in for a treat!  It glides through hair.  It is the perfect size and shape for a moustache comb.  The quality is exceptional.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a little surprise for my husband. He loves it! The comb is tiny- the perfect size for a mustache. It looks more expensive than it was.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to review...its a beard comb</li>
    <li> Keep in mind, this is a very small comb.  I&#x27;d prefer if it were just a bit larger, but it works great as a beard and mustache comb.  I&#x27;ve only have it for a few weeks and the gold print is starting to wear off.  But this obviously doesn&#x27;t affect usage.  I&#x27;d say this is probably best for people who want to perform beard grooming on the go and want something small to keep in their pocket.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a few inches long.  It doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on my beard or stache at all.  Good novelty for the kids though.</li>
    <li> This Kent comb is very nicely made and high-quality, but way too small to work as a beard comb.  It&#x27;s really a bit too small to be a moustache comb, even.</li>
    <li> Great comb! very happy.</li>
    <li> Love this comb the only one my son let&#x27;s me use on his head</li>
    <li> Very good comb, but very small and easy to lose.</li>
    <li> Great comb just wish it was not so thick, doesn&#x27;t really get under the hairs closest to the skin. Maybe I ordered the wrong size or shape but saw no other options. Oh well. Does fair</li>
    <li> well made but much smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> Good strong brush but could be a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality comb, feels very sturdy and classically masculine. A wonderful accessory for your morning beard / mustache grooming regimen. Works well and looks great on the shelf. Also easy to carry around on your person for touch ups throughout the day!</li>
    <li> Handmade, perfect carry size (small), saw cut to prevent hair pulling so its gentle to use (especially when one has some thick wax in their handlebar mustache, which is what I use it for)... So what&#x27;s not to like? I&#x27;m probably nitpicking here, but for starters, the teeth do not go all the way to the edge so you have to really use it square with your mustache. Not a big deal, but it has a small learning curve. Also, because of the near bilateral symmetry of it, I often grab the wrong end and begin combing my &#x27;stache with the handle. Mind you, these are those rare times I&#x27;m not actually at home in front of the mirror, but using it on the go (which, again, its perfect for due to its concealable size), so not a big deal. Overall, I would not switch to anything else or go back to cheaper combs such as the ones that come with electric shaving kits because I can really feel a difference with this. I also don&#x27;t know if my recommendations would ruin the product, so I would hesitate for Kent to make any changes to it. One star removed for the above-mentioned things, and it&#x27;s probably undeserving on Kent&#x27;s part.</li>
    <li> This is bad for beards but great for your mustache. It is also very, very small and you could lose it easily, as I have several times.</li>
    <li> No returns..... So you should know it&#x27;s made for a Barbie doll size wise. And did I mention no returns for a 10 buck mini comb...it surely doesn&#x27;t need the word beard on it.  EDIT TO ADD AND UPDATE  I was quickly contacted by the seller, who issued a full refund without returning the product. Seems health and beauty aids are non returnable. The did not leave me hanging, and by doing so went from one start to 5.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great comb and perfect for most any pocket. ;-)</li>
    <li> This is a great comb.  But as small as it is, its easy to loose.  I&#x27;m on my second one!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this as much as I should, but this thing is awesome. I leave it out and I get a good laugh everytime I see it. It&#x27;s so tiny, and looks like a moustache. Quality construction as well.</li>
    <li> Not happy..... This comb is smaller than the comb my daughter use in her dolls hair, WT* I have a beard, what am I suppose to do with this garbage. DONT LIKE.</li>
    <li> Always great mustache combs!!</li>
    <li> Super tiny, high quality!</li>
    <li> I received excellent product and fast</li>
    <li> It is smaller than I expected, my fault.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mustache and beard comb.  The teeth are solid, evenly spaced, and do not bend; but the tips are very smooth on the skin.  I have several mustache combs, this is very different and the BEST.  Easy to carry, but also easy to lose.  I generally buy 2-3 when I order, as I seem to lose one every couple of months and do not like having to use another comb...it has spoiled me!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it. You&#x27;re not going to be able to comb your mustache effectively with a standard sized comb, particularly if you&#x27;re using beard balm or mustache wax. This is the perfect sized comb to not only train your lip hair, but distribute balm or wax evenly throughout (I use it on my entire Van Dyke). Now if I can just stop losing them since they are so small.</li>
    <li> Great sturdy comb for beards and mustaches.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a comb for your mustache.</li>
    <li> Great quality comb.  Smaller than I imagined it would be.  About 2 inches total length.  More of a mustache only comb.</li>
    <li> This brush is highly portable. It&#x27;s only a few inches long so it fits easily in your pocket. It&#x27;s sturdy and fits in your hand in such a way that a few easy strokes gets that beard nice and groomed.</li>
    <li> The curve to it is great when combing, however not helpful when trying to trim mustache.</li>
    <li> Love it makes my mustache look superb</li>
    <li> This is great for my medium sized mustache. Does ok with beard but I found this to be a bit small. Go with the 113 mm for medium-sized beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handmade and the quality shows. It&#x27;s strong (not that it needs to be for a mustache), and more important does not have sharp teeth.</li>
    <li> I honesty didn&#x27;t expect the comb to work as well as it did.  Especially with it&#x27;s size.  I am an African-American male with very course and kinky hair.  Combing my beard out with this comb is the easiest it&#x27;s ever been.  Best comb ever.</li>
    <li> My beard was itching so bad before I got this. Now I can scratch it with fury and reckless abandon. Bristle tips were more round than I had anticipated too, so I haven&#x27;t scratched myself too bad YET. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Make note, this comb is only about an inch long for the teeth, and a total of about two inches overall. Perfect for the pocket to comb your boss &#x27;stache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really only had this comb for a short time, but if have no issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are probably buying this for a good sized mustache that you are going to style or just need combed well. We&#x27;ll let me tell you, this thing will not snag your carefully grown face fur. This comb is of a very high quality and is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality. Using it for brushing horse hair when rehiring violin and cello bows.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day for a beard he was working on.  Still has the beard but the comb was a bit small for him he said.  He&#x27;s a guy so ..... you know ~</li>
    <li> Nice thick comb.  Very sturdy.  Bristles are nice and close.  Small, but easy to handle.  I&#x27;m glad I settled on this comb over the other few I was looking at.</li>
    <li> I bought this small comb so I could keep it in my back pocket and use when my beard got unruly. Unfortunately, the comb/teeth are just way too small. If you have a light or thin beard, maybe, but full thick beards stay way!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, but the comb is smaller than my pinky finger. It looks cool, but it pretty useless. He just uses a 25cent comb.</li>
    <li> works great and slips into top pocket without seeing it.</li>
    <li> Great little pocket comb good for on the go or anytime beard and mustache fixin. Wish they disgned a case for the comb though</li>
    <li> Bought it as something to complement the mustache wax I bought for my husband. His new favorite tool. Super durable and does a great job on his beard and mustache.</li>
    <li> I wish the handle was a tad larger and the teeth were a bit finer. That being said, the comb does its job and will fit into any pocket. The writing rubbed off pretty quickly, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the operation.</li>
    <li> This Is a joke. It&#x27;s literally smaller than a baby comb.</li>
    <li> This is a great little mustache comb for evenly distributing mustache wax</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, fit and finish.  Substantially better than the cheap plastic ones that come with dis-functional scissors. Really wish it was sold as a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> Great comb to keep in your wallet for who-know when you&#x27;ll need it!</li>
    <li> Like others have mentioned, it is small but that makes it perfect for reaching under your nose easily to comb your mustache. Perfect size for staching on your person when out and about as well. Very smooth and high quality!</li>
    <li> Great product and exactly what I was looking for. Probably the last mustache comb I&#x27;ll ever need. Great quality at a great value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of combs that were cheap and scratched the crap out of my face. This is a well made and well finished comb that is comfortable to use and hardly takes up any pocket real estate. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> When this comb arrived I was shocked at how small it was. I didn&#x27;t realize it was a pocket comb. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it until I tried it. Immediately my beard felt well-shaped and more comfortable to manage. I will be keeping this comb in my medicine cabinet ready for daily use.</li>
    <li> Beautiful for such a small comb . Love this comb. Would recommend it to any man with a beard or mustache.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see this being useful unless you have a beard that&#x27;s longer than 2&amp;#34; and even then this is way too small. I have a feeling it was meant for nose and ear hair.</li>
    <li> The picture made this comb look bigger than it, really is. If you have a mustache or goatee then this comb is for you. This is a nice comb but i have a beard and it is to small. I should of got a bigger one and that is my fault for not looking at a tape measure. Looking at the picture I thought it was safe to buy, boy was I wrong.</li>
    <li> Nice pocket size comb that combs my mustache great!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I anticipated, but works well overall.</li>
    <li> Works great. Perfect little comb to keep my beard looking sharp. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected. Nice small comb for the stach&#x27;. Works well with mustache wax.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband first time mustache and beard grower, cool little comb and fits his wallet but really more just for a short mustache or short facial hair he&#x27;s only been growing it out for a few months and it&#x27;s pretty much too long on the goatee beard end to use</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think this comb would make a difference over the free one that came with a beard trimmer.  I was wrong.  This comb is great.  My &#x27;stache hair from my handlebar doesn&#x27;t get caught or tangled in the teeth, it is the perfect size for my breast pocket, perfect width for combing, and is very sturdy.  Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Loved it so much I bought another to keep in the car. Great!!!</li>
    <li> Small, but effective. Cute, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this little comb for around a week now and it does about what you&#x27;d expect a comb to do. It&#x27;s nice looking, isn&#x27;t flimsy like some others I&#x27;ve had, and hasn&#x27;t broken yet despite my day one attempts to (gently) do so. It combs smoothly and works well evenly distributing waxes but I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars for one reason and one reason above all else...&lt;br /&gt;It is officially the very first comb that I&#x27;ve been able to use that hasn&#x27;t stabbed, scratched, or sliced my upper lip whilst using it so that&#x27;s an A+ in my book.</li>
    <li> This comb is too small for pretty much anything, even for combing your mustache. I recommend using the Kent Hand-Made 143mm All Fine Pocket Comb -7T instead.</li>
    <li> I like the size and shape of the comb, but I thought it was going to be finer toothed than your standard cheapo comb.</li>
    <li> I really do like this comb. It&#x27;s better than a cheap comb from the pharmacy or a comb for your hair. I notice a difference when I use it. It works great on my mustache, but when I use it on my beard, I feel like I&#x27;m using the comb my wife uses to comb our kid&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s smaller than I expected, even though I looked at other user photos. It feels nice and smooth while combing. It doesn&#x27;t feel prickly. It&#x27;s a solid comb for your mustache, but maybe too small if you have a big beard.</li>
    <li> Man, I didn&#x27;t think I would notice a difference from a cheap plastic comb but I do. I love this thing. Feels so good in the beard and on my skin. I wish it was a bit bigger but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. Have one everywhere (the office, the car, home, etc). LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Loved this comb, but my husbands beard was too thick to use it. Ended up giving it to my brother as a birthday gift and he loved it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this comb has good reviews. It&#x27;s really thick which would be a great feature if it wasn&#x27;t so small. Because of how small and thick it is, it&#x27;s not effective at combing anything. I can&#x27;t get into my beard with it. I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of beard combs and this is the worst one I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who is trying to get used to his handlebar mustache.  It seem to do the trick without pulling or tugging or otherwise making his lip uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my 81T for over 6 months now on my beard and mustache.  It is very handy - about 2.75\\&quot; long - and easily fits in the small watch-pocket on my blue jeans.  The teeth, which span about 1.5\\&quot;, are very soft and gentle.  I use this comb to style my mustache either with or without wax, and to comb through my beard.</li>
    <li> Great quality comb for a beard of mustache. Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Love this little comb.</li>
    <li> Always satisfied with Kent Handmade combs. This one in particular is really good for helping to tame my wild moustache.</li>
    <li> The comb is small (can store in wallet) but don&#x27;t let that stop you from purchasing it. It works well. It was for my dh, not me, but he is pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I had the same experience that other reviewers had it seems in that I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and durability of the comb. A small (about the length of your thumb) but thick comb this is perfect for my mustache and beard. The teeth are close together so it is great for detangling. Just a few passes with the comb and a little bit mustache wax made me look so much more presentable.</li>
    <li> I like comb that came with theTweezerman G.E.A.R. Moustache Scissors with Comb. I never use this comb because it&#x27;s to small for my average hands.</li>
    <li> This comb is for a Barbie doll or something. My daughter wants to use it for her american doll. This is not a six inch beard comb as described. It is less than three inches long.</li>
    <li> This comb works well for my mustache and looks pretty cool as well.  Easy to carry around and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Great little comb.  Fits in my wallet and feels really good running through my stash!</li>
    <li> Very small but works good.</li>
    <li> I like this this comb. Well made and sturdy</li>
    <li> Overall I think I my have spent too much money on this comb. It&#x27;s a fine sturdy comb, but for seven dollars I think I could have gotten the same or similar product for less.</li>
    <li> Was not what I expected</li>
    <li> Good size, value and performance.  No pokes or scratches from this comb and feels solid and expensive (even though it is not!)</li>
    <li> This was a lesson learned for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb. $10 can fit in the palm of your hand... not something of any use for the beard I once had.</li>
    <li> Excellent little comb, it was exactly what I was looking for to use on my beard.  I didn&#x27;t like the idea of using my hair comb as it probably had gel residue on it that I didn&#x27;t want to put on my face.  I agree with all the other reviewers as to how nicely the teeth run through your hair (I have a kent regular comb as well that I use on my head)...all of their combs are great.  This beard one is especially small, the pictures don&#x27;t do it justice, but that&#x27;s one of the reasons I like it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that after only 1 week of use, the gold writing on the comb has almost completely come off.  I think it&#x27;s due to the beard oil I am using in my beard that &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; off the lettering, but I would expect better from a high quality product like this.  Obviously this minor detail doesn&#x27;t compromise the actual functionality of the product in the slightest, but it looked a lot cooler with the writing that said &amp;#34;kent&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;handmade&amp;#34;, etc.</li>
    <li> Small comb, small package, but big results! Craftsmanship is noticeable and ease of use is apparent. Great item and a must if you have any facial hair that needs to be maintained!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a well-made comb, but it&#x27;s super teensy. My husband&#x27;s beard is pretty robust and it&#x27;s hard for him to use this comb since it&#x27;s so little, his hands are so big, and his beard is so awesome. The comb is nice. Just maybe better for less hirsute gents.</li>
    <li> A must have if one plans to grow and maintain a fine stash!</li>
    <li> This thing is small.  I have a large beard and only use this for the Mustache portion.  It is too small to have any effect on my beard.  I use the Kent Hand-Made 113mm All Fine Pocket Comb for my beard.  Together they are a perfect combination for any Mustache and Beard.</li>
    <li> My beard appreciates it. But keep an eye on it because it&#x27;s so small it&#x27;s easy to lose.</li>
    <li> So tiny and that&#x27;s what she said really</li>
    <li> Great price and does what it is supposed to do.  What more could you ask for? Possibly a few more teeth for us guys with bushy beards.</li>
    <li> A nice, small mustache comb; however, I would say it&#x27;s a bit ambitious to call it a beard comb as well. It will do in a pinch, but if you have any length to a beard, it&#x27;s almost comical to imagine taming down a beard.</li>
    <li> This is a tiny comb, much smaller than I anticipated. This is by no means a beard comb, but will be good for mustaches. Its about the size of my pinky finger.</li>
    <li> i should have bought more than one.  great quality comb for my mustache and beard- it does not scratch my face when i comb it.</li>
    <li> small, well made comb, perfect for my moustache.</li>
    <li> Strong compact comb, perfect to fit in your pocket and on the go maybe in your car!</li>
    <li> Very small comb not really for a beard more for a mustache</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son at his request.  He absolutely loves it for his wild beard.  I thought it was too small but he says not.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the size of this comb but it&#x27;s actually the perfect size for a mustache and very pretty to look at.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who has always had a beard. I haven&#x27;t seen him without one in 5 years! When this product came in the mail it was a lot smaller than I expected. But he carries it around in his wallet. If you need a quick beard comb, or want to put a smile of peoples faces, than this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Great little comb! Always have it in my pocket.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice comb, excellently designed...and small.  Too small for my mustache.  Maybe if you had a Hitler mustache it would work well...or if you wanted a comb for a Barbie doll&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me and my &#x27;stache and goatee, it wasn&#x27;t big enough.  However, the 113mm Fine toothed pocket comb from Kent was perfect...not for my hair, but for my mustache and goatee!  And since the 113mm wasn&#x27;t big enough for my hair, I had to get the 192mm comb for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t matter, they&#x27;re Kent combs and they are fantastic quality!  I enjoy them greatly!</li>
    <li> Works exactly how you would expect a beard comb would. Excellent quality and gives my beard a more respectable appearance.</li>
    <li> Nice &#x27;Stache comb. Probably a little over priced but I would rather that than be disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> A well made comb and fits my larger hands well. Also, it works better than the brush/comb that comes with the mustache wax.</li>
    <li> this can only be used for a mustache but, ok quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I SAID THIS COMB IS MICRO SIZE!</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it would be a standard size comb. However, this is way too small to use. This would be the comb Ken would use to comb his beard, if he could grow one. Such a let down - the picture makes this thing look huge. 73mm seems like the size of a regular tooth, but it&#x27;s the size overall. May work if you have tiny hands, but real men, be wary.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and the shipping was on time. The comb is only around two inches so keep that in mind. An inch of that is the actual teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a great comb.  It is very small, but easy to keep in your pocket.  It is a high quality item, but it does look like a doll comb.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband. Not only do I see the difference when he uses it on his beard, he actually loves it! win, win.</li>
    <li> The comb is very smooth, and easy to bring in any pocket. It met all my expectations. It&#x27;s now part of my everyday carry.</li>
    <li> These combs were very easy on your face and moved the hair week. I was so impress that I bought 3. The comb is about 3 inches long and I did lose a couple. I for got where I put them. The fit in a pocket well.</li>
    <li> A moustache needs love and attention.  You know that.  That is why you are looking at a comb for your unruly &#x27;stache.  This tool will tame that lip caterpillar and turn it into a luxurious mark of manliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you really think Tom Selleck could have survived all those hijinks without a handmade moustache comb?  I think not.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my moustache.</li>
    <li> Worth the price. Better than combs made by machines.</li>
    <li> Handmade, Instant Classic. Most Excellent!!! Suave, Tortoiseshell-Like Material&lt;br /&gt;Comb arrived safely and as described. My girlfriend loves a combed moustache!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers England!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first moustache/beard comb that I have purchased. I have had it for a couple of days now and I can tell you that I take it everywhere with me.  It&#x27;s a good, durable comb and I would recommend it to my friends and family.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality product. I wish I would&#x27;ve read the description better, this thing is tiny.</li>
    <li> Really small I was expecting a lot bigger Comb, it was about 2&amp;#34; long</li>
    <li> A little to small to be useful. Kent makes a fine comb, but I suggest buying a regular comb by them, and using that instead. The handle is almost useless. It is about the size of a Doll comb......</li>
    <li> If you have a styled mustache this is a must!  I keep one in my wallet!</li>
    <li> Good quality, but I wish I had bought a larger one.</li>
    <li> This comb works great. I don&#x27;t only use it for my mustache but for my beard as well.</li>
    <li> very nice high quality</li>
    <li> Great for my curly beard</li>
    <li> You might think a comb is just is just a comb however, that&#x27;s because you have not tried a Kent comb. This little comb is just the right size for my stache and doesn&#x27;t pull out hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb, a really really nice comb.</li>
    <li> A fine handmade object. Perfect in size to fit in my watch pocket and great for a moustache or small beard.</li>
    <li> The paint wore off within the first week, but, other than that I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I picked this comb up for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. He has a beard and I thought it&#x27;d be a clever little comb for him to carry around with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s of nice quality and the price can&#x27;t be beat! I like how the design is compact but not effeminate in appearance - it made explaining to him why this was a useful gift easier, haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is made of a tortoiseshell plastic embossed with gold letters, with nice, strong tines. Overall, a great value and a smart gift idea for the man who has everything (or needs nothing)!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  He uses it every day and hasn&#x27;t had any negative comments about it; however, I thought that it looked very small.</li>
    <li> The one all others are measured against. Sturdy, fits in coin pocket, but don&#x27;t try combing more than you mustache &amp; beard, LoL.</li>
    <li> Tiny and well made.  I use this to groom my mustache and straighten hairs for trimming with scissors (also relatively tiny).  If you&#x27;re the type that builds duck calls and/or grows facial hair to your solar plexus, this comb is probably not big enough to be practical.  If you&#x27;ve got a Tom Selleck or aspirations as such, go for it.  This is the comb for you!</li>
    <li> The teeth are very short so I cannot get deep into my mustache. I have better luck using a lice comb with long metal tines.</li>
    <li> This is a great mustache grooming comb; sturdy but lightweight.  It&#x27;s always in my pocket since purchasing it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Nice comb for beard and stache! Only one I found small enough to carry around in your pocket, yet strong enough to survive my unruly stache and beard.</li>
    <li> Been using this little guy every day for over a year. It&#x27;s smooth, robust, and dependable - who could ask for anything more. Feels and brushes much smoother than plastic.</li>
    <li> This is just right for styling my mustache.  I use it every day when applying mustache wax and for the occasional run through during the day .  It easily fits in the 5th pocket of my jeans.  It is relatively small, so it won&#x27;t work on longer beards, but it is for than sufficient to comb shorter beards.</li>
    <li> This is a really sturdy little comb but pretty small.  Well made.  I bought two of them.  One for work and one for home.</li>
    <li> Tough little guy for keeping all those pesky mustache hairs in line.</li>
    <li> Nice little comb. Fits in the watch pocket on my jeans. Works well</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this comb. The edges are smooth, but fine, well made, I am so glad that I got this and not one of those cheap plastic ones.</li>
    <li> Was looking for something portable to keep my curly goatee in check. This thing is small (about the size of my thumb), but sturdy and clearly made of solid material. The bristles are strong but soft on the skin. A fine product - would recommend.</li>
    <li> The size is about like my pinky finger, but that is perfect for a pocket or my car ashtray. It is made very solid, not soft plastic that will break easy and it does the job well.</li>
    <li> AWESOME COMB I USE EVERYDAY.</li>
    <li> I carry this comb in my pocket when I&#x27;m at work so I can tidy up an unruly mustache.  I have the longer Swissco I use at home, but I wanted something smaller for work - this is the ticket.  The tines are actually finer (closer together) than the Swissco and I ended up using this at home too.  It&#x27;s little, so if you&#x27;re a beast who can&#x27;t control his hands well enough to hold on to a small comb, then you&#x27;re probably also the type that shouldn&#x27;t be curling the ends of a mustache, and thus, the type that wouldn&#x27;t enjoy using a dainty little comb to comb it out.  I&#x27;m jesting of course, but I can&#x27;t understand how you can be upset at the size - it&#x27;s perfect for a) being small, and b) combing mustaches.</li>
    <li> This thing although small, is awesome.  I keep it in my wallet and pull out when I need to use.</li>
    <li> This little comb is so handly and helps me not have a bad beard day too.&lt;br /&gt;Good for both moustache and beard, beardmen&#x27;s must have.</li>
    <li> Very tiny! Handle and all is the size of my index finger, so obviously the comb is half that. Not what I was expecting, no use for me.</li>
    <li> THIS WOULD GET A &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; BUT IT IS SO SMALL.  I HAD READ OTHER REVIEWS BUT DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY ANYWAY.  I&#x27;M NOT A BIG GUY NOR IS MY MOUSTACHE/BEARD A MONSTER.  OKAY FOR ME BUT A BIGGER GUY WITH BIG HANDS AND  ROBUST FACIAL HAIR PROBABLY NEEDS SOMETHING BIGGER LIKE THE FOT KENT POCKET COMB WHICH I ALSO WILL REVIEW.  HOWEVER, THIS LITTLE FELLOW HAS A GOOD FEEL AND SEEMS TO BE WELL MADE.  THE CURVED GRIP  FITS A THUMB PERFECTLY. IF SPACE IS AN ISSUE (WALLET OR CAR CONSOLE) AND YOU DON&#x27;T MIND THE SIZE, THIS IS A GOOD CHOICE...AND I JUST LIKE THE LOOK.  CUTE LITTLE GUY.</li>
    <li> This comb is great for my handlebar mustache! Definitely feels amazing, and looks classy!</li>
    <li> After I convinced my wonderful boyfriend to grow out his magnificent red beard, I thought I would buy him some nice grooming tools for it as well. I purchased this comb not quite knowing what to expect, I did not expect it to be so small! He tried to use it at first, and it it very good at gently getting out rats and tangles but hard for him to handle in all his manly-ness. He has switched to a regular black comb that many people use in their hair and that works just as good and is easier for him to handle. I would recommended this comb for a moustache or even a sporting pair of mutton chops, but when it comes to a manly full beard, you need a manly full size comb.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product, its going to be part of my boyfriends Christmas present..but it looks like its a good quality product. The comb is A LOT smaller than I had expected..probably about the length of a finger. Hopefully it works as good as the other reviews claim!</li>
    <li> still using it today! great for long or short haired beards.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb.  It makes your mustache not look stupid.  Buy this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several types of moustache combs with varying degrees of satisfaction. This is the one your looking for. It separates the hairs uniformly and they lie just right.</li>
    <li> Excellent strength, unlikely to break, incredibly small.</li>
    <li> This might be a good moustache comb, but I bought it for my beard and this thing is ridiculously tiny. I have smaller hands for a man, in fact my hands are the same size as my wife&#x27;s and I find this comb hard to hold onto for combing out my beard. They either need to make it 50% or more bigger, or take &#x27;beard comb&#x27; out of the description. I pretty much don&#x27;t use this at all. I just threw it in my car&#x27;s middle console storage in-case I need an emergency beard combing for some reason. Maybe I will give it to my daughter for her Rapunzel doll.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for moustache comb!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it. He has had a mustache for nearly 30 years now. He made himself a small comb out of a regular sized comb years back, cut it down to size to fit in his wallet. This comb is perfect. It goes through is mustache very easily. His mustache is very thick too and the comb still works well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a large beard, but I wanted a comb that I could use that was specifically for this application.  It does work, but it is TINY and the teeth are VERY fine.  The quality of the comb is great.  Solid &amp; well made, but even for my little beard, it really isn&#x27;t that functional.  Maybe I&#x27;ll keep it in the car for &#x27;emergencies&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Superb.  Use for goatee.  Works well,</li>
    <li> Item is exactly as described, and is very good quality. I would recommend to my man mane friends! Oh man...</li>
    <li> Very high quality comb.  As soon as you touch it, you can tell that Kent uses a quality material and the teeth are indeed &amp;#34;saw cut&amp;#34;.  My only complaint is the handle is a tad small and difficult to hold if you have larger hands like I do but overall you can&#x27;t go wrong with this mustache comb; I recommend it!</li>
    <li> go ahead and laugh... it might be small but it still works.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and it&#x27;s still great to me. It helps keep the beard looking smooth.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for combing out my mustache! Will get one for the office and one for the car so I can always look my best!</li>
    <li> not as big as expected. very small the size or pinky or smaller</li>
    <li> The quality of the product is great and the size is as described BUT the teeth are too far apart for it to really be effective.</li>
    <li> I should have paid attention to the other reviews on the size before I bought this.  This is entirely to small to be used as a beard comb, and I find it to small to even use on my mustache.  I am giving this 3 stars only because it is so well made, but honestly I am giving this to my friends daughter for play with her barbies.</li>
    <li> The teeth on this comb are polished or rounded on the ends so that they don&#x27;t poke you the way standard fine-tooth combs do. Overall length is about the same as my index finger and it is tough enough that I can carry it in my pocket with my keys every day without damaging it.</li>
    <li> Solid but a little smaller than I thought it would be but overall I think it is more than adequate.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good, durable mustache comb. My boyfriend really liked it as a gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day. I am also glad that it was so inexpensive!</li>
    <li> Always in my pocket to keep my mustache and goatee in check. Not very cheap for a comb, but when you consider that they are hand made and imported, it&#x27;s understandable.</li>
    <li> love this little comb!!! works great on my short beard well worth it</li>
    <li> What a ripoff. This thing is the length of my ring finger, INCLUDING THE HANDLE, and the teeth are no finer than the fine end of a $0.49 ACE comb (and are shorter besides).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of, save your money, and go get an ACE comb at the grocery store for a few quarters.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a handmade come. High quality. That simple. It does the job and def small enough to carry.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve purchased a couple of these and the only reason that we need to keep buying more is because my husband loses them. :)</li>
    <li> Almost comical how small it is, but it a perfect beard/mustache comb. Great for us in the shower or after a shower.</li>
    <li> I ordered this not really reading any of the size specs. I was a little shocked when I received the comb. It&#x27;s the tiniest comb I&#x27;ve ever seen. It works amazing as a mustache comb but if you&#x27;ve got a beard this isn&#x27;t really the most efficient comb. But, it&#x27;s a good backup to leave in your wallet just in case you lose/forget your primary man hair comb.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the description a little bit better. It is a very tiny comb. I would have been happier and better off going to a dollar store for a comb. that is my fault tho.</li>
    <li> A bit smaller than I expected, boyfriend was a little apprehensive at first thinking it wouldnt get through his massive beard that has been in progress for a while now. It is definitely made well, you can tell as soon as you take it out of the package that its high quality and he is extremely happy with it!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really read the description for the length of this so I was quite surprised to receive a comb that was only a few inches long. The blown up picture makes it look big. That being said, it really is the perfect size for facial hair and I really like it. There is no need for a 4&amp;#34; comb to manage your beard.</li>
    <li> This comb Fits into my small wallet!  I could not be happier with this product.  Great price and great product.</li>
    <li> Very cute and smaller than I expected, what is good because I need this comb for my mustache. Feel good in hands and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect mustache comb.  It&#x27;s tiny toothed and can separate those waxed moustache hairs with with ease.  Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> What a fantastic little comb! If you have a &#x27;stache or beard, THIS is the comb for it. Fits easily in your front pocket, carry it with you for a quick touch-up, when needed. When combined with properly applied mustache wax, this comb provides a well-maintained look to your hairy mug. You will no longer be asked if you are homeless or looking for work. Women will smile at you. Buy it! You will be glad you did. You may end up getting a second one for back-up.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift, great online purchase, arrived on time. Item was just what the person wanted and used it immediately !</li>
    <li> quick shipping. nice product</li>
    <li> Perfect to keep in you pocket. Well Made.</li>
    <li> Very high quality, fine tooth, nice and small. Bought a second one for travel, just to be sure I wouldn&#x27;t misplace it.</li>
    <li> Comb arrived as described and on time. When you feel it in your hand you can instantly tell the high quality if this product. The teeth are much finer than any of my regular hair combs, making it much better suited for use on my facial hair. The teeth also feel much more comfortable on the skin of my face. This is the only way to go for a facial hair grooming comb.</li>
    <li> I have got two of these combs for him in case he misplaces one as they are pretty dang small.  He absolutely loves this comb and since he has had it, several of his co-workers have also bought one.  The men all say that it makes the beard/mustache a bit softer and when used in combination with beard oil, the softness becomes even more apparent.  Ladies, get one for your fella if his beard is a bit scratchy to you (don&#x27;t forget the beard oil).  The men have also said that they enjoy combing with it because it feels good.  These handmade combs are far better than the plastic ones, you cannot know until you see and try it.  I tried one of the larger ones on my long hair.  The saw cut teeth kind of clean and smooth the beard hairs in much the same way that a boars hair brush does to my own hair.  The difference here in the cheap plastic combs is that they are molded and as such the fine mold lines in the teeth of cheap combs catch, stretch, and break hairs.  You don&#x27;t know any different until you have a real comb. The men say that the points and teeth of this comb feel so much better than cheapy plastic combs and I see them combing their beards a lot these days.  Men like to groom too and this comb fits nicely in the small pocket of the jeans or in the back pocket is it not very noticeable (the men say).  I have also not heard of one of them breaking, they are very well made.  My hubby has grown quite a beard now and uses a larger Kent comb on it but he still carries and uses this small one on his mustache and whole beard too.  For a large beard or one who changes beard style a bit, I would recommend the three pack of combs that comes with this one in it.  It gives him more options and allows you to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; one of the larger ones for smoothing your own hair.  I have every intention of getting more Kent combs/brushes for myself, they appear to be well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than expected.  It does feel nicer than the little plastic comb I&#x27;ve been using on my beard.  Seems to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; hair and put it in place better than a standard plastic comb.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought</li>
    <li> TINY comb! It&#x27;s maybe 4 inches long including the handle, almost comically small.</li>
    <li> Amazing how well this comb does on a beard or mustache. I was hesitant to buy but glad I did</li>
    <li> Nice moustache comb but lost in beard with thick growth.  Comb is a precision work of art, extra fine teeth very appreciated. And yet though, this little item is easily lost except in a beltline watch pocket.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve grown a respectable moustache, I&#x27;ve occasionally needed to keep it in line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb goes with me easily in the watch pocket of my jeans, and is the absolute perfect size for the moustache.</li>
    <li> I actually own a few different beard/mustache combs and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever handled, hands down. It has the feel of a keepsake item, something I&#x27;ll have for years to come. If you or anyone you know has a beard and wants to treat it right, you cannot go wrong with this little guy!</li>
    <li> Perfect way to evenly distribute wax through the &#x27;stache. Very well made and I have no doubt will be very durable</li>
    <li> Tame that &#x27;stache.  I carry one of these with me at all times.  Bought 6 because I keep losing them but that&#x27;s not the comb&#x27;s fault ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> Such a handy little comb to always carry with me to keep my stache in order!  As others have said, it&#x27;s certainly small. Perfect size for pocket or wallet. Quality made product at a great price!</li>
    <li> Simply the best comb for your mustache. Don&#x27;t question, just buy it.  It&#x27;s durable and pocket-sized.  I carried mine around for a year and a half every day with loose change and it never became damaged. I only had to buy another because I lost the first one!</li>
    <li> I keep it in my wallet and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a really great comb. I&#x27;ve never had a handmade comb before. There is a world of difference between a nice, handmade comb and something that was mass-produced. The beard combs that come with grooming kits are flimsy, and the teeth are so sharp they can irritate your face, which is probably already being irritated by the beard you are trying to grow. But this little Kent, while tiny, seems to be built like a tank. The teeth are so nicely shaped they will easily go through the coarsest beard, yet the tips will be smooth against your skin. I actually use mine, not only for grooming, but to relieve itchiness of new beard growth. Combing my face with this is pure joy.</li>
    <li> Once, many years ago, I purchased a bear trimmer. It came with a free, plastic beard comb.  Since then, I&#x27;ve not come across a better beard comb.  Well, I lost it.  I was sad.  Then, I found this product.  It&#x27;s truly an excellent comb. I have a thick beard and long mustache.  This comb doesn&#x27;t snag and it is the ideal size. Really gets the job done well.  I ordered another one for myself and one for my roommate.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Delivery and price good, it&#x27;s really little!  Certainly fits a pocket,  combs well, but big hands will find it hard to hold.</li>
    <li> This is a great little comb. It is very well made.  I expected this to be a fragile piece, but I was way wrong.  I keep this in my wallet for when my facial hair needs to get under control.  Works for a beard in a pinch, but excels at the mustache.  A great little comb to keep on your person!</li>
    <li> The knives are awesome&lt;br /&gt;I bought these knives to try my dart-throwing skills with knives. This is a reasonably priced set of knives that helped me to develop my knife throwing skills. The knives are awesome, indestructible and well balanced as well as a great product for starters who are learning how to throw.  I plan to purchase another and a sheath this time.</li>
    <li> Great quality and price! I highly recommend this comb if you&#x27;re grooming or waxing a handlebar mustache...</li>
    <li> This comb is the perfect size for travel and, being well made, does an excellent job taming the beast that is my beard.</li>
    <li> This mustache comb is pretty small but works really well. Fits nicely into your pocket and your forget about it.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for mustaches! About the size of your thumb, unless you are Jeremy Lin, then it is half the size. Teeth are close together which help to shape your mustache exactly how you want. Points of teeth are rounded, so they don&#x27;t dig into your flesh. Very, very satisfied with this comb..</li>
    <li> This little comb is exactly the right size and the teeth are at the perfect pitch to groom your mustache to exacting standards. Works very well with mustache wax, and is indispensable if you wish to have any kind of grooming other than a &#x27;straight brush&#x27; mustache.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  The teeth are not sharp, and not irritate my skin.  But it&#x27;s small enough to work with my mustache.</li>
    <li> Purchased this comb for my father with a epic mustache, and he absolutely loves it. He says it feels so smooth and gentle with his mustache, plus it is small enough to just put in his back pocket.</li>
    <li> Pocket sized and portable, my husband LOVES it.</li>
    <li> when i got this comb i was speechless because of the size. it&#x27;s smaller than your smallest finger.&lt;br /&gt;Advice: if you are looking for a comb that does what a comb should do then don&#x27;t get this one, BUT if you&#x27;re bored and you feel like you want to buy something silly that you would laugh every time you look into it, then go for it. lool</li>
    <li> small comb, starts more conversations laying around then i actually comb my mustache with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the Kent &amp;#34;slim jim.&amp;#34; They both have the same teeth, but the slim jim is better.  Get the slim jim.  It is easier to use by being a bit longer and works well for beard, stache, and thin or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Worth It.  Awesome moustache comb...</li>
    <li> Great, high quality handmade comb for your moustache.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This come is only like an 1inch and a half, to two inches long.. My beard was a size 15. This come is only useful for the mustache and other things small. Great quality, doesn&#x27;t hurt pull or scratch but it wasn&#x27;t was i was looking for :[ So i waisted my money kindof. So if you are growing your bread out and want a comb, buy something bigger. This comb was as long as my thumb.</li>
    <li> I thinks that this one is the best moustache comb on the market.</li>
    <li> I nearly wept when I lost my first comb. After enjoying my comb for years I simply couldn&#x27;t live without it.  Of course, I ordered another and love my new one just as much.</li>
    <li> I hate combing my hair but I love combing my beard.  Weird right?  Anyway, this is a nice little comb, worth the money.</li>
    <li> I keep mine in my wallet.  It has bent a little from all the time it has been in there, but works fine.  A true gentleman&#x27;s accessory.</li>
    <li> Very small.  Like smaller than you think it is small.  It&#x27;s good for a mustache but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> While the tiny comb performs its function, it&#x27;s just a little too small for me.  Would prefer a comb about twice the size.</li>
    <li> LOVE this little comb. Smoothest glide through my wiry, wiry beard. I want to get a larger one in the future. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t imagine not having one after I&#x27;ve had one. Specially to spread the wax evenly on your mustache. It&#x27;s really that good.</li>
    <li> I used to use a regular comb for my beard &amp; mustache. Did it work? Yeah,  but this little guy feels better, looks cooler and is easier to fit in all the right spots when perfecting your beards shape.</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer for my bearded man.</li>
    <li> A gift for my son - was surprised by the small size of the comb! But he liked it a lot. Happy with the fast delivery ;)</li>
    <li> I know, its just a comb - who needs a review?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a pretty legit little comb. It is much smaller than I expected, but that&#x27;s because I didnt read the description closely. It is sturdy and strong. The thing just oozes quality. Also somehow it feels amazing running this little guy through your beard. I&#x27;ll be sitting at my desk at home and find myself just combing my beard because it feels so nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> A mighty fine little comb.</li>
    <li> I knew it would be a small handheld comb but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be the size of a barbie comb. Ver very small. Also, very well built. Strong little comb. I love it, and its sure to get attention from my buddies.</li>
    <li> First off let me say that this is a very useful little tool to have in your facial hair arsenal. It is perfect for combing in beard balm, and it makes styling a moustache a breeze. I have a pretty short goatee so it works reasonably well for my beard, but I imagine if you had a substantial, bushy, or Gandalf level beard, this comb simply would not cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, Kent combs are of exceptional quality and design. I was very impressed when this little guy arrived in the mail, so much so that I actually ordered a few larger ones and another little one to carry in my wallet. The design of every comb is strong and built to last, and if I ever buy another one it will likely be because I lost them, not due to product failure. If you have a big beard, I highly recommend one of their folding comb brands to tame your wild mane.</li>
    <li> Great beard brush!  Helps rid beards of knots and food!  Great man-gift!  I bought a beard conditioner and beard wash with this comb and it made a great set!</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a real fine piece.  The quality shows, and looks like something I&#x27;ll be able to use for the rest of my life, as long as I don&#x27;t ever lose it.</li>
    <li> It was smaller thane I expected</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how much I actually needed the comb until my stache was about two months along, and then I became obsessed with the comb. I spent more time combing my stache than any other single event in my day. I can&#x27;t wait for Movember this year to start it all over again and get my comb out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s funny how much I like this product having not known of its existence prior. The quality is excellent and contributes to its ease of use. It is a fine, durable tool for your stache.</li>
    <li> Super high quality, no mold seams. This comb is smooth and lives up to its reputation of snaggle-free grooming. Thank you!</li>
    <li> No complaints about this comb. It&#x27;s small and well-made, the teeth seem to be sturdy and a good distance apart. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great nifty lil comb, fits easily into your pocket</li>
    <li> When I bought this comb I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so tiny. I bought it for my boyfriend&#x27;s unruly beard and expected it to be a little larger. The comb is smaller than the palm of my hand, and I think it&#x27;s cute.  Anyway the comb works great regardless of the size. My boyfriend uses it everyday and has no problems with it. It&#x27;s sturdy and manages to keep his beard neat. Just make sure you know where you layed it down. He keeps his in the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> this comb is comically tiny. How is this recommended as a beard comb?? i would say it&#x27;s only for mustaches, long stubble, and eyebrows. all that said, i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a fantastic-quality brush.</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this and loves it. Fits well in his pocket and he uses it all the time. Great buy and perfect for what he was looking for.</li>
    <li> seems to be a great quality comb. I am currently growing my moustache out but I cant wait to use it. great fit and finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I would Highly recommend this comb or Kent combs in general and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This comb is incredibly small. It caught my off guard how small it is, and I literally laughed out loud when I opened it. If you&#x27;re thinking of growing any beard with any real length, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for you. This was probably about the size of my pinky - perhaps a bit smaller. Needless to say, I immediately ordered a different one immediately after receiving this one. This would be great for perhaps a short mustache.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for combing the old &#x27;stache.  Rounded polished teeth.  Top quality.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this top notch comb.</li>
    <li> If you respect your &#x27;stache then you NEED this..</li>
    <li> This looks like a Barbie comb.  It&#x27;s really small... But my boyfriend seems to be ok with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty damn small, but it does it&#x27;s job admirably. Wish it was slightly bigger, but other than that, no complaints!</li>
    <li> Only useful for moustache but does a good job of that</li>
    <li> Great quality as you would expect from Kent. But a little small for my preference. If you have large hands and THICK facial hair you might want something a little larger.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but works</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do as everyone else stated I didn&#x27;t realize how small it would be but it is definitely a quality made product</li>
    <li> Perfect comb! Beautifully made, I love it</li>
    <li> Love it, very well made and best price I have found. Bought a second to have one with me at all times and one to keep in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> There is only one reason this product did not receive five stars, and that is because it is not a true beard comb (per the product&#x27;s name).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is actually about the length of an average thumb, and a little thinner. It fits comfortably into my wallet. I carry it with me wherever I go, and in a pinch it works on a beard. However, it is a great mustache comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you grab it, although it is somewhat small, you cannot help but feel you are holding something that was made with quality. It has not been designed to quickly snap and be replaced, or to wear fast. I believe this comb was hand made in England with the intention to become a mainstay to meet your grooming needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would but more Kent products without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;-Quality Product&lt;br /&gt;-Compact&lt;br /&gt;-Deep comb (for size)&lt;br /&gt;-Cool Factor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;-Ships from UK and purchase not fulfilled quickly&lt;br /&gt;-Not an actual beard comb (unless you have a dainty beard)&lt;br /&gt;-**Amazon Add On item. I would rather buy two for $10 than one for $6 as an Add On. Add On is one of the worst changes do Amazon IMO in the past 5 years.</li>
    <li> perfect size for keeping the the back pocket of jeans for times when you might want to regroom the stache</li>
    <li> This is a well designed and crafted comb, perfect for combing mustaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally believed that it would be big enough to comb my beard, but I didn&#x27;t notice how small it was when I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been keeping this one in my travel bag, and it has served me well.</li>
    <li> this little comb fits nicely inside my Hazard 4 Badger, at the ready when the beard must be tamed. Yes, it is very small, but that&#x27;s exactly what someone like myself needs and wants. Too often, &amp;#34;pocket combs&amp;#34; are anything but. This comb is very well made, extremely sturdy, comfortable to use and just the right size for knocking down the fluff/tangle and for staying tucked away without impeding access to anything else or sticking out obtrusively. What else can I say? it&#x27;s perfect for what I need.</li>
    <li> Comb is small but sturdy.  It works well on shorter moustaches but is not functional a beard comb.  A $.98 barber&#x27;s comb from the local gas station works much better.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for the unused &amp;#34;fifth pocket&amp;#34; on your jeans (who carries a pocket watch, anyway?) so you can stay well-groomed all day.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect comb! Fits right in credit card slot of wallet, so it&#x27;s always with me. I use this several times a day and damn, do I look good! All kidding aside, great product!</li>
    <li> My husband loved this product and it really helped get his beard under control. Also useful for evenly applying and combing beard wax into the beard.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Very sturdy.  It combs my beard and mustache.  I&#x27;ve owned a Tweezerman one before which the tines broke very quickly.  This one is much stronger and I believe will not have the same problem.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I was expecting, I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description or what ever but I just thought for the price it would be a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Well made definitely matches the price i paid</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this tiny, tiny, tiny comb unless you want to give it to your daughter to comb Barbie&#x27;s hair. What a joke, what a ripoff.</li>
    <li> This is probably the highest quality comb I have ever used but it certainly wasn&#x27;t designed for men with large hands.</li>
    <li> Nice and compact. Very solid feel, not flimsy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been needing a moustache comb for a while now.  I was using just a regular pocket comb.  This comb works perfectly.  It&#x27;s small, but it&#x27;s made just for the stach.  Great little comb.</li>
    <li> Small comb, I&#x27;m new to growing my beard long. I should have read the detail better, this is a super small comb for mustache only.</li>
    <li> Fantastic comb! Unbelievable price! Very speedy delivery! I would definitely recommend this product and seller!</li>
    <li> Too easy to lose. Great comb nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Works perfectly. A small high quality comb for my moustache. A pleasure to use. Good comfort product.</li>
    <li> Awesome comb for my beard and moustache.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these so far; one to replace one that was mislaid (AKA- girlfriend put &amp;#34;somewhere&amp;#34; because she was tired of seeing it on the dining room table). The combs are about 3 inches long so they fit nicely in pants pockets. After finding the mislaid one, I noticed the two combs are definitely not identical. I assume this is because they are handmade.&lt;br /&gt;Utility is very good. My beard isn&#x27;t very long so I don&#x27;t know how well it work for really long face pubes, but it works well with 1-2 inch beard lengths.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend with a rather large beard, so it may have been a bit tiny for his beard. He has not told me much about it, but I am thinking about getting one for my husband. It is adorable and very tiny!</li>
    <li> Plain and simple: it is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Well made and works great.  This is a high quality product.  I have a very coarse beard and this product does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> It is a teensy weensy comb. It does the job.</li>
    <li> Nice mustache comb. Realize it&#x27;s like two inches in length. Very small.</li>
    <li> Perfect for combing the mustache.</li>
    <li> Nice little comb fits in the pocket and keeps the beard looking good at all times</li>
    <li> This is a perfect gift for a mustache-aficionado :)</li>
    <li> not only is this awesome for man grooming a mustache or beard, but the looks and questions i get about it made it worth it! smooth trough facial hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a number of these things... but this is by far the best quality one I have purchased... should last a while.  Would definitely recommend; it&#x27;s worth the extra few bucks.</li>
    <li> Nano size. Can&#x27;t do much with it. Its too small.</li>
    <li> Got this for my dog&#x27;s facial fur.  Works better than dog grooming tools.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  The comb is well made, durable, and quite comfortable to use.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Perfect little comb for the stache</li>
    <li> It may look like a doll comb, but it&#x27;s very strong and works well, a must if applying beard wax.</li>
    <li> great product as advertised.  quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This was a novelty gift, which is all that it is good for. It is the second worst comb I&#x27;ve ever come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle part of this comb is about 1\\&quot; long and the toothed area is about 1 inch long. You can fit your thumb on one side and barely two fingers in the other of the handle and then vainly try to run the teeth through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, although it no good as a comb, it is sturdy. The thickness of the comb makes it sturdier but the teeth will still be prone to breaking if you carry it around in you pants pocket. Best to just chuck it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezeman comb, although it comes with a pair of ridiculously mediocre (i.e., cheap) scissors, is longer and therefore easier to handle and so more useful than Kent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a child with pretend a beard, mustache, or both to comb, then the Kent might work for you. If you are a child, or an adult, with a beard, mustache, or both, then the Kent won&#x27;t work for you. Shop around and be sure to get the length before you buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember, if some of those 5 star reviews read just like ad copy, that&#x27;s probably because that&#x27;s what they are.</li>
    <li> The comb doesn&#x27;t go through his moustache, so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying it.  It is way too small too.  We bought the other Kent comb and he is using that instead.</li>
    <li> Perfect comb for taming your moutache. One smal problem. Mine are cursed and go missing whenever I put them in my pocket. However I keep finding them days later. Better keep an eye on them. Also my 9 year old son likes combing his hair with them!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve experienced those little grey or green mustache combs that come with a pair of useless scissors or a tube of useless goop, then you are in for a treat...if you buy this comb, that is.  No pulling on the hair, no scratching your skin, no bent teeth...using this comb shouldn&#x27;t even really be compared to those other things.  Do yourself a favor and buy this comb.  I&#x27;m so satisfied, I&#x27;m going to buy a few more...</li>
    <li> Just right for your Mustache. The ends of this comb are rounded off so it fills good up agents your skin. Goes thru a long Mustache very well.</li>
    <li> Solid construction. Compact design make it easy for pocket use for using with a shaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;A must for the man concerned looking his best.</li>
    <li> I use this comb for taking the goop from the bottom of the dog&#x27;s eyes. The size is easy to handle while doing this and doesn&#x27;t intimate the dog.</li>
    <li> It keeps my beard under control but everytime i take it out around my friends they always make fun of me telling me I´m a hispter wannabe and then they poke me with sticks</li>
    <li> Great compact mustache comb. Small enough to put in your wallet. Sturdy and the teeth in the comb do not snag even mu wiry hair.</li>
    <li> Not paying attention to the size listed and was expecting a larger comb.  This one is of very high quality, but could be finer.  Works great for mustache and would be fine for a smaller beard, but it&#x27;s not the greatest for a larger beard.</li>
    <li> Seriously the cutest thing I have ever seen.  Highly practical for men with beards.</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband, he has a thick coarse beard, he loves the comb and carries it in his wallet!</li>
    <li> Just what the title says, this is a good little comb. It might not be suitable for a large beard, but it is great for a mustache.</li>
    <li> Small, sturdy, and does what I need it to do!</li>
    <li> Ummm, my bad for not realizing this thing is barbie doll sized. The dimension shown on Amazon is 6 inches -- which I assume is the size of the package?? The comb itself is only 2.75&amp;#34; long. You have to hold it like you&#x27;re sipping tea from a little girl&#x27;s tea set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PASS ON THIS. GIVE ME A MAN-SIZED COMB!!!</li>
    <li> this thing is tiny!  I never use it.</li>
    <li> If you got a stache you need a few of these.</li>
    <li> Love using this on my beard. Feels so good! It&#x27;s so handy as well. So small. Exactly how I want it!</li>
    <li> Too small for anything other than a doll or a My Little Pony.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim for my mustache and I feel like they could get away with charging a lot more than their asking for. Bought a couple more of their other combs because this one is just incredible. Highly recommend buying this if you need a comb for your beard/mustache or like combing your hair with a small comb.</li>
    <li> On time.  As expected.  Would recommend.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> I should have looked at the size. Got this for my beard, but it&#x27;s a little too small, better for a doll. My son now uses it to comb his non-existent mustache.</li>
    <li> It fits just right under the nose and over the sideburns. My husband loves it and I love his well groomed beard.</li>
    <li> Good brush! Husband loves it. Small enough to fit in wallet or pocket. Good quality and very well made. Good product</li>
    <li> Over the winter, I let my beard grow out to 2\\&quot;+. In the mornings, I&#x27;d use [[ASIN:B000TUOXCC Diane Double-Sided Men&#x27;s Club Brush, 100% Boar Bristles]] and [[ASIN:B0062K33CE Botanical Skin Works Men&#x27;s Bay Lime Beard Conditioning Oil]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, sometimes, my beard would start looking unruly and some hairs would wander out of place before the end of the work day. That&#x27;s where this comb came in handy. It&#x27;s great for mid-day beard maintenance, so that your beard still fits in well in a professional environment. It is very small/portable and fits perfectly in my front pants pocket, with a lot of room to spare. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is much better than those hair pulling metal combs they sell in drug stores. It helps me style my handlebar quite well and it&#x27;s made of sturdy plastic!</li>
    <li> This comb is very small, it is great quality but maybe not worth the price. If you are looking for a comb the size of a pinky finger this is your comb.</li>
    <li> This little comb is such an awesome accessory for that &#x27;stache! I can&#x27;t help but laugh every time I comb mine.</li>
    <li> Perfect to keep your moustache looking well groomed and not like your nose hair has attacked your face. Yes there are cheaper combs out there, but this one is thick and you can feel the quality.</li>
    <li> I have a full beard and long mustache. I thought that this comb might be of value in grooming it. I was wrong. The comb is so small that I had difficulty holding it. It was also too small to run effectively through my hair. After spending three weeks fuming over what seemed like product mislabeling, I returned the comb to Amazon and replaced it with a double-sided Diane boar hair brush which was both more effective and less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a short beard, this comb might have some slight value. However, Amazon has better alternatives, both combs and brushes, which will cost you less. Don&#x27;t be misled by this item&#x27;s bestseller status.</li>
    <li> Purchased comb for mustache and it works great.  Small enough, yet big enough to comb through hairs.  Sturdy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Full disclosure, I wasn&#x27;t thinking about how small 73mm was when I ordered this. However, it is made for moustaches and it does a wonderful job combing that out so that I can easily keep it trimmed. So, not what I thought I was getting but it is extremely useful</li>
    <li> Nice little comb that I can keep in my back pocket and pull it out whenever my mustache needs tamed. Definitely better quality than other combs that I have used. The teeth don&#x27;t bend or mishape.</li>
    <li> I wish my husband had viewed the customer images. This was a lot smaller than expected and he has a rather robust beard :) I guess it would work well for a short beard or mustache though!</li>
    <li> This little comb works great, and it was cheap.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> The right size and shape to get a handlebar in shape</li>
    <li> very very small comb. I had to return it.  I originally got for my husband&#x27;s beard but there&#x27;s no way this would comb it. it would have gotten lost.  I think the comb is maybe an inch big.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. Tiny, but awesome. Great for my beard, fits neatly in my wallet. High quality comb.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small, read the print before you order so your not surprised. The comb is just wanted and expected, a small comb to use at home on my mustache and goatee style beard. If you have a mountain man bush of a beard this is not for you. I will be ordering the Kent folding version to carry around in my pocket later today.</li>
    <li> This is a well made comb, good for both stache and beard.  It&#x27;s size fits well in the 5th pocket of my jeans.  I felt it was a bit pricey, but it is quality has made up for it.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, given as a gift and well received!</li>
    <li> My husband say&#x27;s he loves it. Hand made! Easy to stash in his wallet. Best gift ever.</li>
    <li> This guy is a bit pricey, but I discovered long ago that good brushes and combs simply cost more. I recently became a full beard and mustache kinda guy, and I took some advice and got a good comb for my mustache. I really love this thing and how it helps me tame my hairy beast. I highly recommend this comb.</li>
    <li> Kent provides a number of quality products. Their mustache comb is just another example. Well priced and does its job well.</li>
    <li> Very very small, must been made for a doll.</li>
    <li> A little small for beard. Great quality. Good for mustache</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband and he was very pleased. Its the perfect size to fit in his pocket. Shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to make a another purchase for my father(:</li>
    <li> Great Comb, does the job!</li>
    <li> Perfect size.  It fits in my wallet.</li>
    <li> This is a great little fine toothed comb for my mustache and goatee.  I had been keeping it very short to avoid the &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; look of hairs going their own way and looking shabby.  This little comb helps straighten every hair and makes my goatee look groomed and quite nice.</li>
    <li> It works well on my mustache. It is a little smaller than I expected although I am not disappointed in the size.</li>
    <li> If you want a mustache comb you want this one. There are cheaper plastic ones, don&#x27;t waste your money you will end up buying this one. Just get it already. What are you doing? Go!</li>
    <li> This comb is comically small. It would be nice if the comb was viewed with a quarter or something to show scale, because it is miniscule. I had no idea I was buying a comb this small, and &amp;#34;handmade&amp;#34; is a stretch because it is obviously cast plastic. There is no way this is handmade. I suppose it might be designed by a human, but 100% machine made, period. It is so small I can&#x27;t even hold it with my hands. Stewart Little might be able to use it, but it will get lost in my Paul Bunyan forest of a beard. Thanks for nothing.</li>
    <li> Beautifully made comb!  The teeth are nice and smooth unlike a lot of cheaper combs.  It&#x27;s relatively small, but nice for a mustache!</li>
    <li> Works great for the mustache,  yeah it&#x27;s small but I wouldn&#x27;t want it any other way.</li>
    <li> Good Product, would love it if the handle was a touch larger I have Large hands and its difficult to hold.  Great Quality though!</li>
    <li> The quality seems pretty good on this comb, but I had no idea how small it is.  Literally like a doll brush.  It&#x27;s actually funny.  That being said it does comb my mustache and beard well.  I prefer my boar bristle brush.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought, but it was just the right size for my beard and mustache.  I&#x27;m going to buy another one for my travel bag.</li>
    <li> The best mustache comb.. If you&#x27;re thinking about growing it out... Order this now- it will make the process easier... Don&#x27;t wait till you&#x27;re eating it.</li>
    <li> This comb is the perfect size for moustaches, although it is too small to be useful as a beard comb (or my beard is too long, but thats surely not right.) This comb is well made, durable, and will have your moustache looking dapper in no time at all. The comb is small, only a couple inches long total, but its a great size to use with a surgeon&#x27;s precision on your upper lip. If this comb doesn&#x27;t have you getting all the ladies in no time, then you obviously aren&#x27;t using it right. Consider yourself warned though, if this works for you as a beard comb, then your beard needs some improvement.</li>
    <li> My husband could not find this in New York.  He searched high and low.  So, when I saw this on Al-Rehab&#x27;s product line, I bought three (1 for his car, 1 for the house, and 1 for him to leave at work).</li>
    <li> I personally think mustaches are gross but my spouse is going for a Sam Elliot.  So this definitely helps</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine, well-made mustache comb, and it works really well...&lt;br /&gt;but don&#x27;t fool yourself - the toothed section is 1-3/8&amp;#34; long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagining you can use this as a beard comb, too, means you have a really tiny beard,&lt;br /&gt;so use it on your eyebrows, too.  Get your money&#x27;s worth...</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY COMB... I WISH IT WAS A LITTLE BIGGER. IT FITS PERFECTLY INSIDE YOUR WALLET OR POCKET. GOOD JOB!</li>
    <li> The comb works just like a comb should. It has some substance to it and the teeth are spaced correctly.</li>
    <li> I really like this comb. The teeth are well cut and very smooth. If the handle were slightly longer this would be a perfect comb.</li>
    <li> all i can say it&#x27;s a top notch quality,very,very well handmade,&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to all who&#x27;s have a moustache and want to keep it at it&#x27;s best!</li>
    <li> This comb is only about three inches long TOTAL - it&#x27;s a mustache comb.</li>
    <li> I made the mistake of thinking it was a large comb for my beard but its actually a tiny one for your mustache. It still works great and looks amazing. Its a great conversation starter when you pull it out of your pocket and comb your stache!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different mustache/beard combs. None were exceptional, some were practically unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moment I touched this thing to my facial hair, I knew this was different. It feels amazing. It&#x27;s a sensation I have no prior experience with. I fell in love instantly. I will never use another comb on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a fine/coarse pocket comb from Kent. Same experience, but on my head.</li>
    <li> Great comb. Does the job amazing. Its tiny - looks more like a doll comb than an actual comb, but this tiny comb packs a big punch. Just have to keep a close eye on it - its easy to lose.</li>
    <li> Because I&#x27;m American and I don&#x27;t Metric, i got a chuckle at how tiny this thing is.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting full-size but... what is this, a comb for ants?!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But actually it&#x27;s perfect and does the job of keepin&#x27; my beard untangled because sometimes you don&#x27;t want to look like a Viking and this is for those times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*Zoolander; never gets old.)</li>
    <li> THIS COMB IS VERY STURDY AND IT WORKS FINE IT COMBS THE MOUSTACHE &amp; BEARD FINE THANKS VERY NICE I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TO OTHERS THANKS...</li>
    <li> Websters define&#x27;s \\&quot;Awesome Beard\\&quot; as a condition in which facial hair grows in excess creating a majestic beard. This beard then commands the attention of the room and is a magnet for eyes and attention of all around you.&lt;br /&gt; The Kent Handmade Comb is the perfect tool to keep an \\&quot;awesome beard\\&quot; straight and neat throughout the day. Small enough to be concealed in a wallet but powerful enough to tame my own beard (about 4 inches in length) this comb is a master piece. This essential item works wonders and for the price of the comb itself it is well worth the value.</li>
    <li> pretty good but very very small very easy to loose if you carry it with you as I found out.</li>
    <li> Love this little comb. My beard can get a little crazy throughout the day so having this comb handy really makes the difference  between a wild mess and looking good. It&#x27;s really small and perfect for carrying in that little pocket on your jeans.</li>
    <li> A great comb. I dunno about beards, but there&#x27;s nothing better for your moustache. Only downside is that maybe it&#x27;s a bit easy to lose if you carry it around all the time; I think mine fell out of my pocket or something. So I&#x27;m here to buy another.</li>
    <li> Very small. lol. The kids laughed hysterically when I opened the package to find this comb about the size of a half dollar. lol. But, my husband says it is perfect for his mustache...so that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> This comb is very small, I guess its made for mustaches, but even for a beard it is too small IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that it is a very nice comb but I disagree with the reviews that you will never go back to cheap combs, I don&#x27;t quite see the value.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in perfect condition.  Smaller than I expected, but nice.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend to put in his Christmas stocking. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Comes in very handy to brush my mustache.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;If wax gets stuck in the comb, just clean it with soap and warm water.</li>
    <li> Great &#x27;stache comb. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> tiny comb. can literally hide it inside my beard. makes me feel like a giant though, which is like...  ahh yeaaa. it&#x27;s like tiny expensive food at a fancy restaurant... you don&#x27;t know if you got ripped off, but you feel ritzy.</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot that can be said here. If you have ever seen a mustache comb you know pretty much all you need to know about the size of this thing, it is a little comb. Mostly I always got mustache combs with a trimmer kit, they were cheap, very inexpensive plastic combs the moment you hold this little bugger in your hand you can tell the difference. Kent has produced a very nice high quality comb made out of a nice solid material. They really put a lot into their combs. Each comb is hand made out of a solid blank of faux tortoise material for a nice strong comb with a nice classic look. The blanks are then cut to shape, the tines are then cut by saw creating a tough durable tine that is then hand buffed and polished to prevent damage to your hair. The effort that Kent puts in to these little beauties in just wonderful you can&#x27;t go wrong with Kent combs.</li>
    <li> This thing is tiny but does the job. My wife loves that it tames my beard and I love that it fits in my wallet.</li>
    <li> Nice to toss in the pocket for grooming the beard. I will buy another as I tend to misplace small things like this.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with mustache and wax. But I like the product so far.&lt;br /&gt;Learning how (much) to use.  So far so good.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly strong, wonderful little fine tooth comb. A little overpriced IMHO but it works well on my barely manageable beard. Very good product.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little pocket beard comb.  The wife thought I was silly for buying it, but I use it all the time, and carry it with me almost everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> Maybe I missed or misunderstood something in the product description, but I didn&#x27;t realize how tiny this comb would be. Tiny, not just small. The whole comb w/ handle is maybe 2 inches long. Might be fine for a mustache but it&#x27;s too small for a full beard.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like brushing my stache with this guy after a shower or when I&#x27;m laying in bed reading. It&#x27;s just so soothing, much better than the cheaper ones with thinner plastic bristles I&#x27;ve had in the past (which were probably more for applying things than a good comb).</li>
    <li> I like this comb a lot.  Was worried by the picture that it was going to be a little large.  But it was a perfect size.  I&#x27;d like to see the fine comb teeth extend all the way to the tip to better separate those stubborn middle mustache hairs.  But this could cause the teeth to break off.  I still like and have bought a couple that way I always have one handy.</li>
    <li> This works great with short hair but once the beard gets long enough, convert over to a comb or you will be brushing all day.</li>
    <li> Too small to be of use even as a mustache comb. I should have read the description closer. I regret purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Read closely (pull out your ruler), this thing is TINY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;What is this!? A comb for ants?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift for my bf. It was tiny, so we got him a more appropriate sized one for his grown man self. I ended up getting him the Chicago Comb Company Model No. 2 and my bf LOVES it. He often calls it his \\&quot;favorite gift\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GTTGVAE?psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy it direct from Chicago Comb and they will engrave it for you (fancy). Also, if you live in Chicagoland, they will hand deliver them to you (or meet you while you finish the rest of your last-minute Christmas shopping at another store :P )</li>
    <li> But that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a great handmade comb.  I have a long beard so I don&#x27;t use it on my beard, but I do use it occasionally on my mustache.  I carry it in my wallet because it is very small.</li>
    <li> Great comb, great quality, will last for years.  Now if I can use it long enough to tame this facial hair it will be an even better product.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with others that this is NOT a beard comb.  But it is a nearly perfect moustache comb: small enough to stash in any pocket, and indestructible (you&#x27;ll lose the little guy before that happens).  I would have given five stars if it was twice as long.  Perhaps then it could be used on the rest of my face.  Very well made comb, though.  Kent combs aren&#x27;t cheap, but they certainly are quality.</li>
    <li> Maybe excellent for moustache, if your moustache is thick and needs to be combed. Excellent quality, nevertheless. I instantly ordered a bigger comb by the same brand after receiving this tiny one.</li>
    <li> Perfect comb for my stache!  Fits great in my front little jeans pocket for quick touchup.</li>
    <li> My husband is not fond of this purchase. He says it is too small. I looked bigger in the picture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what could be expected out of this comb, but it works great. I mean it combs my mustache when I comb it, so unless your a giant with huge sausage fingers, this should work well for you.</li>
    <li> Awesome for the stash</li>
    <li> I know it is my fault for not reading the description in detail, but WOW. This brush is so darn small. It is literally the size of a &amp;#34;My Little Pony&amp;#34; comb or a Barbie comb. I have a very difficult time holding this thing and getting it through my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard Brush I think not.&lt;br /&gt;Toy brush sure....</li>
    <li> Nice little product.  I have to admit i thought it would have been a little bigger since i didn&#x27;t look at the dimensions but after using it for over a month i&#x27;m def. impressed and like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full beard that I like to keep around 1/2&amp;#34; to 3/4&amp;#34; long.  Any longer and it starts to curl more then i care for and it gets to be a bit shaggy.  This comb works well fluffing it out when i&#x27;m going to trim it and then to style it down after i get out of the shower or add some beard oil to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the size, its basically held with ur thumb and forefinger as youre not going to get much more on it.  The plastic is good quality and does scrape or scratch up much.  I normally keep it on my dresser next to my beard oil but have also kept it in my pocket at a wedding a few weeks ago with my keys and it didn&#x27;t mark it up at all either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your one of those guys with a big biker beard or working to be competetive and the World Beard Championships, i&#x27;d consider a bigger comb as this is just too small/fine to be efficient.  Otherwise if you like to keep a smaller and well kept beard, this is a great, inexpensive comb for you.</li>
    <li> Guess it&#x27;s my fault for not reading the size specs. But serious...this comb is for a child. Way too small for a man to use for his beard or mustache.</li>
    <li> Comb is extremely short and un-returtbable</li>
    <li> You can tell this is very well made just by holding it. It was a bit smaller than I expected but that was my fault for not reading the details. Make sure to check the sizes before buying! They have other sizes available if its too small for what you need.</li>
    <li> I bought this little guy after leaving my Kent 113mm Fine Pocket Comb in another state. Being without that for a couple weeks clearly made me realize how much I needed a mustache comb. The stache was just unmanageable without it. I stumbled across this little comb and just like it&#x27;s big brother, this comb is great. Perfect for my mustache and is very sturdy and well made. Not much else to say about it. You will understand when you try it!</li>
    <li> The damn thing is about as big as my thumb</li>
    <li> I keep loosing these, and buying more. That has to say something about the quality of these little combs.  I need to better organize myself, and put this little comb in a special pocket or something, every time I take something else out of my pocket, I must accidentally pull the comb out too, and it falls away.  If you want to try on e of these combs for free, just follow me around for a few days, and I&#x27;ll probably drop one.  They are of such high quality that you could boil it in alcohol after you pick it up off the sidewalk behind me, and use it for yourself.  I use Stache Wax, and these combs are great for combing it out and making it even, then I put it under hot water to wash out the wax.  I think I have bought a dozen of these so far, because I keep losing them, and cannot groom myself without them.</li>
    <li> Well made.  Larger than the moustache comb that I was using, but perfect for beards and thicker moustaches.</li>
    <li> very nice tiny sturdy comb. hard to hold but easy to carry.</li>
    <li> This comb is just okay, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for a bigger thick beard, it looks like a barbie comb.</li>
    <li> This is just silly to have.</li>
    <li> It is a great small mustache and small bread comb. Now... where the hell did I leave it? Guess I&#x27;ll have to order another one.</li>
    <li> Great little beard brush...well-made, no issues...does the job well.</li>
    <li> Do you need a moustache brush? Yes you do. For simple grooming or for what I use it for - to evenly distribute moustache wax. A comb just don&#x27;t cut it. If using it for wax invest in a cheap tooth brush to clean it daily.</li>
    <li> Small compact. Maybe too small. But it works, when I can find it.</li>
    <li> I had a regular kent pocket comb and it is so soft and polished, so I thought i would give this a try for fun.  Its quality was on par with my other combs.  This comb was more of a novelty for me but if you have legit facial hair this is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem came when I spilt alcohol based aftershave on it in my luggage and the plastic deformed and the teeth swelled together and made the thing unusable.</li>
    <li> Great little comb. Definitely a mustache comb, not a beard comb. Well made, works nicely. I bought a second one so I could have one for the washroom and for my pocket.</li>
    <li> First saw these combs on several beard-related YouTube channels I subscribe to and decided to give them a try and they don&#x27;t disappoint! Sturdy construction and smoother than any other comb I&#x27;ve ever used as well as perfectly sized to throw in your pocket and carry throughout your day. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These combs have been known to return to their homeland at will, which happens to be the space between the car seat and the center console.</li>
    <li> The comb is tiny. Not even big enough to comb a beard or even a thick mustache.</li>
    <li> Any man with facial hair should own this comb.  If your only experience with combing your facial hair comes from those flimsey little plasctic combs that ship with beard trimmers, you do not know what you are missing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb goes a long way towards grooming and softening your facial hair and removing tangles.  I now use mine daily, and I love how it makes me feel.</li>
    <li> Pretty much the only viable option out there for a good moustache comb.  I&#x27;ve actually taken a look at the teeth under a 20x microscope, and they are quite smooth.  Makes for a great snag free comb that I use to help style my stache when I feel like putting some wax in it.</li>
    <li> Decent comb but not made for a thicker beard. After the delivery window passed I had to call about the order and then it finally came. They responded quickly but wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the product.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Most beard and mustage combs will bend and break easily. This one doesn&#x27;t bend by normal use and is great for cleaning and maintaining your beard.</li>
    <li> So yeah, good enough for 007, good enough for me. But seriously, the Only way to comb one&#x27;s stache is with a Kent comb.</li>
    <li> Amazing little comb. It definitely seems sturdy enough to last a long while and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as I comb my beard. Definitely recommend this comb to all the bearded kin out there. If you feel it may be to small for your liking, Kent makes combs in different sizes as well.</li>
    <li> it is a nice little comb. i gave it to a buddy who grew out his mousestash and he liked it</li>
    <li> Man this thing&#x27;s tiny.  It would be good for a mustache but for beard...it&#x27;s too small.  For my beard, it would be nicer if the teeth were closer together.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush it just does little for my latte large beard. Smaller than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to fit in my trifold wallet.</li>
    <li> My bf loves this. Coming his beard is almost therapeutic, and this is perfect.</li>
    <li> What more can you ask for? It is what it is.</li>
    <li> I like this comb. It does a really great job. I have used it for a year now and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> A PERFECT mustache comb!</li>
    <li> i use this everyday and couldn&#x27;t imagine life without now. i can&#x27;t believe i wouldn&#x27;t comb my beard ever! if you&#x27;re thinking about getting this, get it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this comb a while back when I was growing my handlebar mustache.  Prior to getting this Kent comb, I was literally using a tiny comb that belonged to one of may daughter&#x27;s dolls.  It was a purple comb.  And it pulled my lip hairs.  It hurt.  A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no lip-hair-comb expert, but I can tell you this works way better than a purple, doll comb.  The teeth of the Kent comb are stiff and don&#x27;t bend like a plastic comb.  The teeth stay straight to muscle their way through wirey (in my case) mustache growth.  The teeth are machined from a solid piece of resin using the same technology used to produce parts for the International Space Station and nuclear ballistic submarines.  It&#x27;s also rumored that before each comb leaves the factory, they are rubbed on the bare thighs of swimsuit models to polish them and provide that &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; shine.  Sam Elliott himself is in charge of quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small comb.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be big.  If this comb is too small for your mustache, then you&#x27;re not growing a mustache anymore, you&#x27;re growing hemp to make rope.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to fit in that small pocket of your jeans that you haven&#x27;t had a use for...until now.</li>
    <li> Small, but not as thin as I wanted. I&#x27;m looking for a thin mustache comb, but this one didn&#x27;t fit the bill.</li>
    <li> I should have looked more closely at the description before I bought this.  The comb is very small and reminds me of a toy doll&#x27;s comb.</li>
    <li> Need to order these in bulk, the beard oil I use washes right off and keeps clean!!!! Great size too</li>
    <li> Bought one and sadly lost it within a week.  Was such a luxurious experience on my skin I ordered a second one!  Excellent combs...there&#x27;s no going back once you get yourself a Kent comb.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the diminutive size fool you-I have a fairly long beard and it works great. It&#x27;s easy to keep in your pocket and not notice it until you need it. This isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;novelty&amp;#34; comb, it&#x27;s a great item made by someone who knows beards.</li>
    <li> This is a tiny tiny comb. Probably the smallest one I have ever seen.</li>
    <li> This is a great little comb.  Easy to store in your pocket and doesn&#x27;t scratch up your face.  Only down side is that it si kind of easy to misplace, so better be prepared to buy two in case you lose one.</li>
    <li> Too small to be of value. I mean really small.</li>
    <li> This comb is for the mustache and it is perfect!  I love the way my mustache looks after using this comb.  I highly recommend for those that are growing out their epic mustaches.</li>
    <li> Handy pocket comb for me.  It&#x27;s small size works well, and it is a finely made comb.</li>
    <li> Great Quality, Glides through Mustache and Beard. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a well made beard comb. It&#x27;s easy to use and combs my beard to a smooth look</li>
    <li> Read some reviews that said it was too small.  Of course I thought people were just nit picking.  This comb is good for nothing but a short mustache.  Still gave three stars due to no false advertising.  HOWEVER, SELLER SHOULD PUT A QUARTER NEXT TO ONE IN THE PICTURE.....ITS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE.</li>
    <li> This is good for combing and applying wax to &#x27;staches and not much else. They are too small to get a decent grip on enough to run through a manly beard, which was my intention in buying it. I lost this thing and I do not plan to replace it. NOT recommended for beards!</li>
    <li> It works great for cleaning our Yorke&#x27;s eye goop.</li>
    <li> ITS SMALL I LOST IT IN MY BEARD ON THE 1ST USE</li>
    <li> Bought as gift he loves it and uses it many times a day.</li>
    <li> Tames the mane and fits in my coin pocket!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  For the price, it is TINY! My thumb is bigger..  I&#x27;m sure it said the size in the description but I was really shocked.  It ended up being more of a joke than a real gift.  He keeps it in the cabinet but continues to use a regular comb for his beard.</li>
    <li> Hello Gents, if you have a beard like I do than i would reccomend this comb. Im not sure why i wanted one to begin with, but once the idea of on-the-go grooming got into my head, i knew i had to have one. I had seen large Kent brushes in the past so i was already aware of their simple style and quality. I have been very happy with this purchase. So seldom does something so inexpensive make such a difference. This thing has been in my pocket since it arrived. its the perfect everyday carry size, and its easy to hold. My fiancee loves my beard already, but being able to give it a quick comb thru before we meet for dinner after a long day is a nice touch. Not gonna lie- makes me feel like a Dapper Dan Man ( but with a beard ).</li>
    <li> Hard to find a nice quality comb for mustache. Little small for the beard but very happy over all.</li>
    <li> Perfect pocket comb. It&#x27;s just about exactly the size of my tin of mustache wax.</li>
    <li> The teeth of the comb are so close together that it&#x27;s impossible to comb my mustache or beard, I&#x27;d just glides over them, even if I hold the hairs with my fingers and press the comb it hardly goes through, and when it does it just pulls out my hair. Complete waiste of money, I once made a bet for $10 that my hand was bigger than someone&#x27;s else&#x27;s and lost, and I didn&#x27;t consider that a waiste of money, so saying I waisted $4 on this comb is really saying something. Considering this thing gets great reviews either my brush in particular is crap or my hair is too thick (though I can use a steel flea comb with our any issues) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this comb</li>
    <li> This comb is a must-have for anyone wanting to tame their unruly moustache. Hercule Poirot would have become one of his own adversaries for one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my doubts, as I&#x27;ve never bought a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; comb, but the Kent 81T works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using (reluctantly) a green, plastic piece of injection molded crap that came with a tube of cheap moustache wax. The teeth, if you want to call them that, were thin, mostly bent, too close together and pulled the hairs of my impressive soup strainer so much that I rarely used it. The handle is also so small, it WAS difficult to hold. (I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo showing both combs, if you would like to compare the two.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That has all changed with the Kent 81T!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered three from a seller in Jolly Old England, of all places, and I keep one at my desk at home, one on my desk at work, and one in the watch pocket of my jeans (which is perfect for this diminutive comb).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is a little small, but not TOO small. After all, you&#x27;re combing a moustache, not a sheepdog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is adequately large, I am able to easily grip it even with my large manly fingers (those of you of the feminine persuasion may find it a delightful fit), and using it to comb my &#x27;stache is like a dream: There is NO hair pulling with this hand-made, sawcut comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought three tins of Burts Bees Miracle Salve and I am using the two together on a daily basis to train my rather anarchistic lip-follicle-extrusions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use the comb on your beard, in a pinch, but this comb really does its best work on a moostache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never owned a \\&quot;premium\\&quot; comb before, but am so impressed with my Kent 81T, that I just ordered a Kent Rake Comb to use on my head hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These combs are a little more expensive, but I think they&#x27;re worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pamper yourself today!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let its little size fool you, this comb is solid and feels significant in your hand. Does a good job at brushing my bushy &#x27;stache.</li>
    <li> This little comb has more teeth than my old girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;She had six last time I saw her. I remember it was at the county fair and her and another girl was getting on the Tilt-A-Whirl.</li>
    <li> Really expensive for what it is. Use a dolls comb and you&#x27;ll save money.</li>
    <li> Bought this comb to replace one I&#x27;ve had for years. It&#x27;s a nifty little replacement, and I emphasize &amp;#34;little.&amp;#34; I often have to sift through my drawer to find it hidden among the tweezers, brushes, and normal size combs. The smallish size makes it perfect for stuffing into a pants pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good solid feel to it, though.</li>
    <li> Evenly distributes moustache wax, which is impossible to do with a normal comb, and fits perfectly in my wallet. Works great for my entire full beard, so I no longer have to carry a larger comb around with me during the day.</li>
