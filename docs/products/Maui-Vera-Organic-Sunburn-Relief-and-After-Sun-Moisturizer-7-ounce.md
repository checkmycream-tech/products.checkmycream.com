      <li>guy&#x27;s for making this fantastic product. ~Laurie</li>
      <li>Never sticky or greasy, it makes your skin just silky smooth.</li>
      <li>it made my skin so velvety smooth.</li>
      <li>Also now available on internet.</li>
      <li>Good product, absorbs completely yet moisturizes.</li>
      <li>It is far superior to any other sunburn product I have used, and I am very fair skinned where sunburn is an ongoing problem.</li>
      <li>I was so glad to find this product to take away the heat and pain from the first application.  </li>
      <li>Soaks I to your skin and leaves skin feeling clean and moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I am actually going to contact the company and tell them how great this is for pregnancy itching because it would provide so much relief to pregnant women everywhere!  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a fantastic product that&#x27;s not a mix of toxic chemicals!  </li>
      <li>I am surprised they do not recommend this more often for pregnant women!  </li>
      <li>it is a godsend since you have to worry about what you put on your pregnant body.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absorbs too quickly.</li>
      <li>Love the scent and leaves your skin silky soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m healing quickly, it helps with the pain, and it moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I ordered this on a whim and it helped me keep my color and heal my skin.</li>
      <li>Worked great for a week in Jamaica - slight burns turned to tan overnight.</li>
      <li>Great to use everyday as a moisturizer, not just for after the sun.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for after-sun care or for those times you&#x27;ve spent a bit too much time soaking up the rays - it literally decreases sunburn, burn symptoms and sun rash in 24 hours and eliminates with continued used (no peeling, itching, scalyness).</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used t yet but love the texture so far.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Maui Vera is a very refined product, feels and smells great, lasts longer than the other products I have tried, and is not sticky at all.</li>
      <li>It feels good on your skin too, not all gooey like the other aloe Vera products.</li>
      <li>I had no idea the sun was frying me right through the clouds on Maui.  </li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>aloe is like that we had a very large one years ago.</li>
      <li>Vera works great as a moisturizer too, especially after swimming.&lt;br /&gt;There will always be a constant supply of Maui Vera in my house.</li>
      <li>On top of that you get a big tube and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Keeps skin soft &amp; smooth.  </li>
      <li>I wish I had found it much sooner, but it took my husband going to Maui to discover it!  </li>
      <li>My whole family used it after having a bit too much fun in the sun.</li>
      <li>It worked very well for my son&#x27;s eczema!  </li>
      <li>We first bought this while on island.  </li>
      <li>my sunscreen evidently didn&#x27;t work and I burned;</li>
      <li>first day in the ocean and poolside I got borderline burnt...</li>
      <li>I first encountered Maui Vera when vacationing on Maui.</li>
      <li>The hot arizona sun can burn within 10 mins, and IT DOES.&lt;br /&gt;Maui</li>
      <li>My feet were burnt and I was able to don flippers later in the evening without issue.</li>
      <li>LOVE it so much I could write a commercial!!!!</li>
      <li>I like it as both a more natural alternative for a general moisturizer after a shower as well as it&#x27;s intended use after being in the sun.</li>
      <li>I had tried pure aloe vera from a plant and Boericke &amp; Tafel Florasone Cardiospermum Cream which is homeopathic and was trying to avoid the cortisone creams.  </li>
      <li>Really helps attenuate the pain.</li>
      <li>Tried it after a sunburn in a sunbed, getting ready for my vacation in two weeks to Dominican Republic.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t really help with the burn.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>i was pink, but not terribly so, however I knew I needed to get the heat out of it</li>
      <li>Not only is it highly effective cooling a burn and keeping from peeling but aIso at home in our dry climate, it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this</li>
      <li>evening I applied a normal amount to my skin, I wouldn&#x27;t call it a liberal coating at all.  </li>
      <li>wow did it do the job!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought some of this in Maui after a pretty bad sunburn. It has been the best stuff I have used for a sunburn. I&#x27;m healing quickly, it helps with the pain, and it moisturizers. It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I&#x27;m glad to see I can order it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I was afraid the scent would be strong or too feminine and that my two son&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t like it but that was not the case! I&#x27;m a total FAN of this stuff! I like it as both a more natural alternative for a general moisturizer after a shower as well as it&#x27;s intended use after being in the sun. We aim to avoid burns at all costs however it works well for even a tinge of pinkness to keep the skin hydrated and healing. Thanks for a fantastic product that&#x27;s not a mix of toxic chemicals!  I will definitely repurchase this product!</li>
    <li> I picked this up for my family since we are all on the fair side. I especially LOVE the fragrance. It&#x27;s like aromatherapy. But imagine my delight when,in desperation,I used it on my face to combat itchy skin (caused by extremely dry, aging skin) and it solved the problem. Great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I used this after laser hair removal and IPL. Soothes, cools and moisturizes. Love the scent and leaves your skin silky soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Smells great works better</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Fast shipping.  This stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> Update: Back again to Maui. Got a very bad sinus head cold. Was taking alot of vitamin C for 2 days, but got a very stiff neck from plugged up sinuses + a very bad running nose. I put on back of neck and forhead every 2hrs with 4 applications since I had nothing else. Also I put it under my nose very lightly.  WOW, WOW, Wow sinus congestion for me is now gone. NO STIFF NECK. PLEASE let me know if this works for you. Cough also gone. Original reply 2 yrs ago: The best sun relief organic product I have ever used. We were there 7 weeks and I used it every evening and never was pink the next day. It really feels very good if you keep it in the refrig. What a nice cool  moisturizer. Brings your body temperature down. Sometimes on Maui it is hard to find, but I got mind at an ABC store. Also now available on internet.</li>
    <li> I had no idea the sun was frying me right through the clouds on Maui.  I was so glad to find this product to take away the heat and pain from the first application.  Not only does it have a delightful smell of lavender, but it has quality ingredients like Hawaiian noni, arnica, peppermint and of course aloe, all great healers for the skin.  Plus it feels so soothing when applied, and dries non-sticky.  My burn was no longer an issue after one day of use, but I kept using it because my skin felt so great.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> My husband just brought back a tube of this from Maui.  He saw it and said he couldn&#x27;t resist asking about it because it had my name on it.  He told me the lady he purchased it from highly recommended it for any skin irritation and it was not only exclusively for sunburn.  He used it on some mosquito bites and he said it relieved it instantly.  I am experiencing some severe itching and rashes from my pregnancy and was desperately looking for relief.  I was beginning to scratch myself raw!!!  I had tried pure aloe vera from a plant and Boericke &amp; Tafel Florasone Cardiospermum Cream which is homeopathic and was trying to avoid the cortisone creams.  They both worked okay but never really stopped the constant nagging feeling need to scratch.  I applied this and immediately the gel cooled down the area and stopped the itchy feeling INSTANTLY.  I thought the peppermint in the list of ingredients would irritate my skin but it cooled the area instantly.  I am surprised they do not recommend this more often for pregnant women!  Being organic and 100% natural it is a godsend since you have to worry about what you put on your pregnant body.  On top of that you get a big tube and the price is very reasonable.  Any \\&quot;maternity\\&quot; type products usually costs more and doesn&#x27;t necessarily deliver on their promise.  I am so glad I found this product by accident.  I wish I had found it much sooner, but it took my husband going to Maui to discover it!  I am actually going to contact the company and tell them how great this is for pregnancy itching because it would provide so much relief to pregnant women everywhere!  I just ordered a tube for someone&#x27;s baby shower and I know they will be thanking me when they use it...</li>
    <li> good product, but leaves a sticky film residue</li>
    <li> Worked great for a week in Jamaica - slight burns turned to tan overnight. It also helped keep away bugs in the evening with the peppermint scent!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It is great for sunburns and helps irritated skin. I prefer it over regular aloe vera.</li>
    <li> After sampling Maui Vera during a trip to Maui last year, it has become a staple in our summer skincare routine! Every time we&#x27;re on the islands or back on the mainland, we look to restock. It&#x27;s great for after-sun care or for those times you&#x27;ve spent a bit too much time soaking up the rays - it literally decreases sunburn, burn symptoms and sun rash in 24 hours and eliminates with continued used (no peeling, itching, scalyness). Simply cannot live without MV and we now use year round! Only con would be that it needs to reach the mainland - thank goodness Amazon now sells!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. It&#x27;s absorbs too quickly. Overall it&#x27;s a 4 star.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to everyone. I&#x27;m a red headed Brit and I burn bad. My husband has dark skin, but gets a burn when he first goes into the sun. This stuff is amazing we both love how quick it heals our skin. It feels good on your skin too, not all gooey like the other aloe Vera products. I tried it in Maui, but I use it year round in Canada to help with my dry skin in our cold Canadian winters. I use it every day. Be careful if you buy it because its hard to find, and you will never want anything on your skin other then this.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really help with the burn. Feels good putting on &amp; smells good but that&#x27;s about it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again :(</li>
    <li> Tried it after a sunburn in a sunbed, getting ready for my vacation in two weeks to Dominican Republic. Takes itchiness away instantly, very pleasant, NOT greasy. Beware that the peppermint smell is very strong at FIRST, but goes away very quickly. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and cooling feeling.  Keeps skin soft &amp; smooth.  Great to use everyday as a moisturizer, not just for after the sun.</li>
    <li> Good product, absorbs completely yet moisturizes.</li>
    <li> It worked very well for my son&#x27;s eczema!  It is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Used it for sun relief, and am using daily as a wonderful smelling moisturizer. Never sticky or greasy, it makes your skin just silky smooth. Heck, I even use it to shave with. If they make a sun block, I&#x27;m buying it by the car load.&lt;br /&gt;Try it once and you&#x27;ll be hooked, too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is Aaahmazing. Soothing, healing can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Soaks I to your skin and leaves skin feeling clean and moisturizer. Definitely alleviates sunburn pain.</li>
    <li> This is amazing for sunburns. I won&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
    <li> Best after sun product I have ever used</li>
    <li> Got a tube at the Kona Boys shack near the Ironman start line in Kona. Works as advertised. My whole family used it after having a bit too much fun in the sun. Really helps attenuate the pain. My feet were burnt and I was able to don flippers later in the evening without issue.</li>
    <li> My husband and I recently discovered Maui Vera on our recent trip to...Maui.  I am fair skinned and burn very easily. My husband ha s native blood in him, so he gets a dark golden brown, and hardly ever burns.&lt;br /&gt;Our first day in the ocean and poolside I got borderline burnt...i was pink, but not terribly so, however I knew I needed to get the heat out of it right away.&lt;br /&gt;In the gift shop of our resort we found Maui Vera.  I constantly use aloe, and lavender at home to soothe sunburns, so this seemed a perfect fit. What it is, is miraculous!!&lt;br /&gt;That evening I applied a normal amount to my skin, I wouldn&#x27;t call it a liberal coating at all.  By the morning the heat, and pain were gone, just the pink skin remained.  This continued to be the same outcome everyday we got a little too much sun.&lt;br /&gt;After an evening application, by the morning the heat and pain were gone, and only the pink remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remain very, very impressed. I was also impressed by the &amp;#34;non&amp;#34; sticky feeling.  Usually aloe products leave a sticky after effect. But not Maui Vera.&lt;br /&gt;After returning to the desert of Arizona I continue to use Maui Vera.  The hot arizona sun can burn within 10 mins, and IT DOES.&lt;br /&gt;Maui Vera works great as a moisturizer too, especially after swimming.&lt;br /&gt;There will always be a constant supply of Maui Vera in my house.</li>
    <li> After letting the fun in the sun get away from me, I had a pretty good burn in Maui. Bought Maui Vera and 2 applications later no more burn!! I&#x27;m AMAZED at this wonderful product. When I got home (Oregon) I ordered 4 more bottles for my family. LOVE it so much I could write a commercial!!!! Thanks guy&#x27;s for making this fantastic product. ~Laurie A forever Customer/Fan</li>
    <li> THIS SAVED ME! During my vacation to the Caribbean mid winter, I was white as could be. Luckily, I ordered this on a whim and it helped me keep my color and heal my skin. I applied every night after spending the day on the beach and it felt amazing. It&#x27;s soothing, smells great, and kept my burn away.</li>
    <li> it goes on a little sticky at first... but just give it a minute and OMG! it made my skin so velvety smooth. I took it to Costa Rica with me on a girls trip and I didn&#x27;t burn, but a girlfriend of mine got scorched! I gave her some of my Maui Vera and she was hooked... said NOTHING in the past has taken care of her sunburns like this did! a couple applications and by the end of the day... she was practically back to normal. she says she&#x27;ll never, ever travel without Maui Vera again! lol.</li>
    <li> I first encountered Maui Vera when vacationing on Maui. I took surfing lessons on my first day and managed to get a truly impressive sunburn on my backside and thighs which my bathing suit did not cover, so bad I could barely sit for days. I picked up the usual solarcaine gel and struggled by with that, until I was recommended Maui Vera by a local. It is far superior to any other sunburn product I have used, and I am very fair skinned where sunburn is an ongoing problem. Maui Vera is a very refined product, feels and smells great, lasts longer than the other products I have tried, and is not sticky at all. I am very impressed, will never be using anything else.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  So soothing.  I feel good about the ingredients for my family.</li>
    <li> We first bought this while on island.  Not only is it highly effective cooling a burn and keeping from peeling but aIso at home in our dry climate, it&#x27;s very moisturizing. Highly recommend this and so glad we can reorder on Amazon!</li>
    <li> my sunscreen evidently didn&#x27;t work and I burned; found this on the internet and ......wow did it do the job! Kind of sticky but aloe is like that we had a very large one years ago.</li>
    <li> Great after sun moisturizer...or great any time</li>
    <li> I ordered this for our trip to Costa Rica and Summer plans. Usually, I wear 30-50 sunscreen but spend a lot of time outdoors so wanted something for my skin. Haven&#x27;t used t yet but love the texture so far. I also use this after hair removal with my HPL.</li>
