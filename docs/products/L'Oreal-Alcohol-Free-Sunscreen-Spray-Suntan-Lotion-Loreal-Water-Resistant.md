      <li>EASY WASH OFF.  </li>
      <li>EASY ON SKIN.  </li>
      <li>Or...  &amp;#34;It takes too long&amp;#34;  (so does skin cancer) &amp;#34;It has a strong scent &amp;#34;</li>
      <li>/&gt;In sum, I am a huge fan of this product.  </li>
      <li>I do not like the lightly tinted, foundation- type version of this product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too light for my skin</li>
      <li>and this together makes my skin look FABULOUS.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and light, not greasy</li>
      <li>Way, way to light tinted for my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>If your skin is oily, choose an oil free SPF product, otherwise you&#x27;ll look like you dipped your face in baby oil.</li>
      <li>It is not oily and goes on smooth on the skin.</li>
      <li>And this BB lotion is fantastic.  </li>

      <li>I was so excited when I saw this.</li>
      <li>and this was true for my skin type.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t someone make a good sunscreen that does not make your face white, greasy, or flammable?</li>
      <li>On other days when I want more polish, I use a lightweight foundation on top for more coverage.  </li>
      <li>As for the tint in this particular product, it&#x27;s very light, and didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference to my skin tone whatsoever.</li>
      <li>and I was delighted as I love a BB cream, especially one with a high</li>
      <li>it absorbs quickly into my skin but that covergare issue, is just a deal breaker for me.</li>
      <li>This stuff goes on so smooth and light, does not make me break out, and really truly protects your skin.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly into the skin with no greasy sweaty feeling.</li>
      <li>I also love the light tint which is fine for my medium/tan complexion and just helps enough to cover imperfections.</li>
      <li>It looks like a light neutral shade when it comes out of the bottle, but I have found that it doesn&#x27;t give me too much color.  </li>
      <li>I use a light foundation over it on the days that I really want even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With nearly every lotion that has more than 40 SPF, my skin reacts.  </li>
      <li>very similar to products I already own.</li>
      <li>Steer clear of this at all costs, even if its free!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before and really like it; have used the regular &#x27;untinted&#x27; version of this product.  The ease of ordering thru Amazon was attractive.  However, the product I received is the tinted version  and is labeled such on the bottle.  The image shown here indicates the product is not tinted which is what I wanted and was expecting to receive. I will try it as it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to send back a small product like this one, but probably will not order this product again via Amazon unless it&#x27;s clearly indicated which product is offered for sale.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I saw this. What drew me in was the high SPF count and that it was also a BB. When I tried it on I was so surprised at how moisturizing it is ( I have extremely dry skin) I didn&#x27;t use moisturizer with it, wanted to get a feel for it on it&#x27;s own. However you can, but put the moisturizer on first. The consistency is smooth, silky and lightweight.The coverage is&amp;#34;buildable&amp;#34;. I applied it with my beauty blender. I only gave it 4 because the tint is too dark for my fair skin. I gave it to my friend. Was soo bummed because I do love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for my BF&#x27;s gift,so i don&#x27;t see them by myself,i think it fits well for her</li>
    <li> I liked the feel of the lotion and it had nice coverage, unfortunately, it made me break out!  I heard this was common with BB creams and this was true for my skin type.</li>
    <li> I wear this daily as my foundation and I absolutely love it. It gives great sheer coverage and conditions &amp; protects my skin.</li>
    <li> I live in Hawaii so SPF is really important for me to wear every single day. This is my GO-TO product. I have tried many other BB creams with SPF50 and they are all either too heavy, make me break out, or do not provide true sun protection. The &amp;#34;kiss my face&amp;#34; brand is more natural but always has my face burnt from not enough coverage. This stuff goes on so smooth and light, does not make me break out, and really truly protects your skin. Oh, and I have extremely oily/greasy skin but this has been the only formula light enough not to make my shine any worse! I also love the light tint which is fine for my medium/tan complexion and just helps enough to cover imperfections. A GOD SEND!</li>
    <li> I never use to wear sunscreen on my face as it leaves the face oily n shiny. But this loreal sunscreen is amazing its soo light, non greasy n airy. U don&#x27;t feel like wearing anything at all. My skin looks amazing. It has a lil tint, which makes u feel u r wearing makeup on.. Love it. Blends so nicely on the skin</li>
    <li> Very silky and smooth to put on--tinted, but not too much. Very light weight.</li>
    <li> We like the tint, no more white spots</li>
    <li> Not sure how much it protects from the sun, really, but covers well</li>
    <li> I used to put on expensive sunblock and then a light BB cream. Now i have 2 in 1 and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> Great product with 50 sun screen, but too expensive to use every day.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few sunscreens I will actually use daily.  Much to the dismay of my derm, I don&#x27;t like using sunscreen, which with squamous and acktinic issues and a family plagued with all kinds of skin cancers, I should really grow up.  Daily, I argue with myself, particularly during the short summer months: (whining)  &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t have time, I&#x27;m already  late&amp;#34;. Holly, do you have time for skin cancer operations ?  Or...  &amp;#34;It takes too long&amp;#34;  (so does skin cancer) &amp;#34;It has a strong scent &amp;#34; (so does skin cancer) ,&amp;#34;It gets into my eyes&amp;#34; (slow down, use the mirror !)  &amp;#34;It stains my clothing it  makes it greasy, dirty&amp;#34;  (so does skin cancer) ,&amp;#34; It burns&amp;#34; (so does skin cancer).  Seriously folks,  I like this product. Unlike most facial sunscreens it applies easily, absorbs quickly and has a less obvious scent than most other face creams.  I wish L&#x27;Oreal made a similar product for the entire body -  a non-oil based,  body lotion with the same amount of viscosity as this line of  facial lotions. Extra Note: I do not like the lightly tinted, foundation- type version of this product, I prefer only the sheer version (less whining)</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and burn really easily.  I have been in the hunt for a product that will give me more than 30 SPF for the summertime.  And this BB lotion is fantastic.  Here are the reasons I like it --&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) EASY ON SKIN.  With nearly every lotion that has more than 40 SPF, my skin reacts.  I have been using this lotion for a couple of weeks now, and have not had any skin irritation.  It feels as lightweight as the Olay 25 SPF that I normally use in the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) FINISH.  I was surprised at how smoothly this goes onto my skin, and how it feels.  It is a thin lotion -- not goopy like some other BB creams -- and it goes on very easily.  And after a few seconds, it gets such a smooth finish that it feels like a dusted a light coat of powder on top.  I really, really like this aspect.  The BB creams that used to be my favorite, from Dr. Jart, would leave my skin feeling a little bit sticky, especially on humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3)  TINTING.  This is a tinted lotion.  It looks like a light neutral shade when it comes out of the bottle, but I have found that it doesn&#x27;t give me too much color.  (I am very fair and always use the lightest shades of foundation.)  If anything, this cream doesn&#x27;t give me enough tint.  I use a light foundation over it on the days that I really want even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4)  EASY WASH OFF.  This lotion removes completely with facewash.  Some other BB creams have required more exfoliation, and if I used Clinique clarifying lotion after washing my face, I could see on the cotton swab how much makeup was left on my face.  This lotion totally passed that test -- no remaining makeup to remove after washing.  I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I am a huge fan of this product.  I have it on Subscribe and Save and will continue using this product in the sunnier parts of the year.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s the perfect face lotion/sunscreen for daytime, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  It goes on a little bit shiny, but gets matte-er as it dries.  It&#x27;s also worth noting that I have dry skin that thinks oil-free moisturizers are child&#x27;s play, so this is on the thicker/oilier end of the spectrum, but I like that.  It is tinted, but not noticeably so once it&#x27;s on - my boyfriend uses it in a pinch without complaint ;)  I hope L&#x27;Oreal keeps making this!!</li>
    <li> Good But the color I choose is deep for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that goes on light and is not greasy.  The formula is lightly tinted which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I saw the product. High SPF, and a BB. I sometimes mix my primer with my sunscreen for the protection plus to acheive a mat/poreless/oil control apperance.  So this product combines all you need.  The only issue I have is the tint.  It is clearly not designed for olive or brown skin tones.  I am brown and love to sit in the sun. It&#x27;s too light for my skin but since I purchased it I am going to try and make it work.</li>
    <li> I hoped that this was at last it, the sunscreen I&#x27;d been looking for. Until I opened it; it smelled like lighter fluid.  I spread it on my face anyway, and my eyes began to water; I looked at the box and was surprised to see a warning--flammable until dry!  Can&#x27;t someone make a good sunscreen that does not make your face white, greasy, or flammable?</li>
    <li> Was trying to find a replacement for the discontinued Neutrogena liquid moisturizer SPF 50 that I have used for over five years. Saw that this was tinted so I figured why not try it. It seems to work, but the tinted part could potentially be a problem for some if you don&#x27;t have yellow undertones in your skin. It could make you look orange. So, the tinted part that was a plus for me turned out to be a non-factor.  This formula is described as a matte finish (I agree), but when you put it on it feels a bit greasy and takes a while to dry down to the matte finish.  The biggest problem for me is the horrible smell of this product. It is a chemical smell that takes a long time to go away. As for the sun protection aspect, I haven&#x27;t gotten burned using it, but then again, I&#x27;m not in the sun for long periods of time. Will I buy this again once I&#x27;ve used it up, nope. The smell is just too off-putting. My search continues...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s surprising difficult to find a high quality SPF that doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on your face without spending tons of money. This is my third bottle, and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how much I still love this. Haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts, sunburns, or skin allergies, and my skin is oily, which says a lot. Love that it has SPF 50, and though the bottle is small, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Did you read the part that says &amp;#34;Flammable until dry?&amp;#34;  FLAMMABLE!  Keep away from heat.  What the heck?  What if you sweat?  Can your face go up in flames if someone lights a cigarette?  Could a blow dryer set you on fire?  There is no way this is going on my face.  I&#x27;m not taking any chances.  Flammable?  What chemical in this does that?&lt;br /&gt;No Way! No way. That is crazy.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  I wear it everyday, sometimes under foundation and sometimes on its own.  It provides a bit of coverage, mattifies.  I love it!  I am so happy to have come across it on Amazon... Haven&#x27;t seen it in stores in CA yet.</li>
    <li> I have now tried this product and its relatively similar sister product the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Sublime Sun Advanced Sunscreen SPF 50+ Liquid Silk Sunshield For Face. Both of them have the same very slippery, liquidy feel, and both left a remarkably greasy sheen to my face after application. The other key issue with both was their strong petroleum smell - as a consumer who is pretty concerned with the chemicals in my beauty products, I was left seriously wondering what could be in this stuff to cause it to smell like gasoline! As for the tint in this particular product, it&#x27;s very light, and didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference to my skin tone whatsoever. Overall I was dissatisfied with both of these new entries to the sunscreen market, and will be returning.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, super lightweight and gives skin nice color</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t break me out for a long time. I did a lot of research and purchased this a few months ago. I absolutely love it. It has a slight tint and makes my skin glow. It has really high spf and great for every day use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting for an SPF 50 for my face that will not cause a reaction on my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m happy I gave this a try - no burning, itching, redness - it just feels soft, clean, and now protected.  There is no greasy after feel that you get with many moisturizers that SPF 50.  It&#x27;s actually a very thin and watery formula and I did have to get use the the consistency.  The tint is very, very, very sheer.  On days I am feeling lazy, this is all I use with some bronzer and lipstick.  On other days when I want more polish, I use a lightweight foundation on top for more coverage.  I&#x27;ve tried other BB creams from the drugstore and department stores, this one suits my skin the best.  Love this stuff and hope they never stop making this product!</li>
    <li> This product is too lightweight in coverage for my taste. I was expecting to have a bit more coverage since it does have a tint and when I poured it on my fingertips, it looks like it will hold up. But when I smooth it onto my face, the color is totally non-existant. It is smooth to the touch and does not feel greasy. I like that it absorbs quickly into my skin but that covergare issue, is just a deal breaker for me. If coverage is not an issue for you and you just need something that has spf + bb cream function, than this will be perfect for you.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth.  If you want something for the summer that will not run in the heat, this is great.  Usually can&#x27;t go wrong with L:Oreal.</li>
    <li> I got this free at the beach from the L&#x27;oreal girls and I was delighted as I love a BB cream, especially one with a high factor.&lt;br /&gt;First impression wasn&#x27;t great as it went on with a very greasy finish and instead of looking dewy, I looked sweaty and like I needed to wipe my face. Second realisation was that this stuff is painfully sore if it gets anywhere near or around the eyes so be careful if you are out in the sun, getting into water or perspiring as all three of these things happened to me over the two days I was using this product and my eyes were red and stingy for the most part. Third and final straw for me was noticing that I had started to get all these little angry whitehead pimples all over my face in areas I didn&#x27;t even know you could get spots. I even got one lump come up on my face that had three different whiteheads on it!!!! Chemical content is insanely high...Steer clear of this at all costs, even if its free!</li>
    <li> smooth consistency; easy to apply and looks great</li>
    <li> I have used the regular sunscreen version of this for over a year and when I stumbled on the BB tinted version I wanted to give it a try. Why not eliminate some steps in the summer time getting ready routine? The coverage is very sheer, not your typical BB, even less than that, but does make your skin look more even. However, when you&#x27;re at the beach or at the pool who wants full coverage anyway? I&#x27;m quite oily and it dries to a nice dewy semi matte finish. Hasn&#x27;t made me break out or any other skin irritations. I am actually buying a second bottle to keep in my travel bag!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen so I took a risk and ordered it online.  The packaging had a second label over the original label on the box, the sunscreen was tinted, which is not how the large picture represented the item, and the bottle had a weird plastic cover over it.  My original purchase, from the store, has a bottle with the print directly on it.  I&#x27;m not sure that I received the actual product.  SO disappointed!</li>
    <li> The BEST tinted sunscreen EVER for OILY skin!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It feels so silky in the skin and DOES NOT leave it shine!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product! My latest &amp;#34;addiction&amp;#34; for sunscreen protection.&lt;br /&gt;Way to go L&#x27;Oreal!</li>
    <li> Really liking this!  Goes on smooth and light, not greasy AT ALL.  Perfect minimal coverage for summer months with excellent sunscreen.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Liquid Silk BB Sunshield takes the place of foundation makeup for me. For me, the color matches my skin tone perfectly. The coverage is sheer, evens out my skin tone and dries to a light matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite summer makeup because it does not feel greasy and it stands up to heat and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as its sunscreen properties, I don&#x27;t know enough about these chemicals to say whether they are effective or not. It seems to prevent sun burn. I use this BB sunscreen just on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen. Feels smooth going on, has no distinctive smell, and provides great protection!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my vacation to lake Powell. I wanted a high SPF, some color to it and water resistant. It worked great! I&#x27;m very pale and I didn&#x27;t get burned! It was not greasy, very light coverage so it didn&#x27;t cover the breakout I was having, but would definitely recommend for a day at the beach or vacation!</li>
    <li> Great! Amazing texture, really quick absorption. I wish could have find a cc version.</li>
    <li> Skin feels so soft after love this stuff</li>
    <li> I want a transparent sunscreen but this is &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, lightly colored, great product.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to find in the stores. I have looked. It is not oily and goes on smooth on the skin. It has a beige tint and no oily issues or break outs. The sun protection is 50 which is really great for the face. Most are 15 or 30- great BB lotion.</li>
    <li> Works well under make-up and very light!</li>
    <li> I love this tinted sunblock. It goes on silky-smooth and lasts a long time.  The reason I&#x27;ve only given it three stars is that a friend looked up its ingredients  and many are on the list of causing cancer.  I&#x27;m now looking for a safer tinted sunblock.</li>
    <li> I looked like a mime with this lotion.  Way, way to light tinted for my skin tone.  Wonderfully light feeling and seemed to do a good job of sun protection.</li>
    <li> Replaced my foundation. Amazing silky smooth feeling. Looks flawless and natural. Perfect summer SPF/light makeup coverage. I have red undertones on fair skin, so I mix a little bit of a green primer with this (I use the green L&#x27;oreal Magic Anti-redness correcting primer) and this together makes my skin look FABULOUS. My boyfriend even told me &amp;#34;whatever makeup you&#x27;re wearing, keep wearing it&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly into the skin with no greasy sweaty feeling. The lotion has a slight tinted quality, but actually provides very little in the way of covering up blemishes or dark spots.  It does not feel heavy like a lot of sunscreens do. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I prefer to wear this product in the winter/colder months versus the summer. During the summer this product makes my skin extremely oily (I have combination skin). I went through 2-3 oil absorbing sheets per day. I&#x27;m saving it for winter. If your skin is oily, choose an oil free SPF product, otherwise you&#x27;ll look like you dipped your face in baby oil. I&#x27;m giving it three stars since I like the idea of a BB cream with SPF 50 in one.</li>
    <li> Thus stuff goes on easily, not sticky or gooey, and absorbs instantly. No breakout issues and it does not feel like I am wearing anything. I also use the spray on my body and it is excellent!!!!!</li>
    <li> very similar to products I already own.</li>
    <li> OK product for the price. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product for your skin.</li>
    <li> I cannot get this around my eyes because it stings! very uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of sunscreens for my face including products that cost $25 or more (Clarins, La Roche-Posay). This is absolutely the best. It&#x27;s light and fluid and easily applied. It has a light tint that evens out my skin tone nicely, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I highly recommend buying and trying.</li>
