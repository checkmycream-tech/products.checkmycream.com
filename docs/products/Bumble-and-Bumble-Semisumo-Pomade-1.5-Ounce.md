<li> Just remember to only a small amout of the product at a time.</li>
<li> It still tends to weigh my hair down.  </li>
<li> This product is a little on the greasy side.</li>
<li> Need a little product just to give it some texture and definition.  </li>
<li> It is a little lighter and has some shine to it.  </li>
<li> and I was looking for a product to just add a little something and keep it in place.</li>
<li> Applied to just-dried hair, yields sheen &amp; control with precision - but very little hold.  </li>
<li> Seems a bit lighter, at least on my hair.</li>
<li> This is hard wax and very hard to get into fingers or palm.</li>
<li> I like my hair to look a little dirty and tousled, and this works well.</li>
<li> I was on vacation and having a terrible time with my hair in a high humidity climate.</li>

    <li> This stuff is great.  My hair is fine, dense and straight.  Need a little product just to give it some texture and definition.  Most waxes have too much hold, and other pomades I&#x27;ve tried look terrible and weigh my hair down.  This stuff gives my hair the perfect amount of hold and texture, and it is very light.  Looks very natural in your hair too... I&#x27;ve found some pomades/waxes make your hair look loaded with product.  This stuff really is the best product I&#x27;ve found for my hair.  The Sumowax is grew too, I use it when my hair is short enough for wax.  I&#x27;ve tried American Crew, Suavecito pomade, Layrite pomade, and none of them are as good as Semisumo.  American Crew Forming Cream is decent, but a little too sticky.  But just a heads up, if you are looking for a pomade like Suavecito and Layrite to slick your hair back like you&#x27;re auditioning for Jersey Boys, Semisumo  is not for you.</li>
    <li> Excellent light hold with a wonderful scent. I truly enjoy this pomade!</li>
    <li> Gave this a great review because as a man with curly hair, it was hard for me to find a shiny hair pomade that is durable and long-lasting.  I got the semisumo as a recommendation by my stylist and have never used this before.  It smells great and keeps my hair molded and shined for the entire work day and into the evening!</li>
    <li> Perfect tamer and finisher.  Applied to just-dried hair, yields sheen &amp; control with precision - but very little hold.  Worked into no-shine/hi-hold B&amp;B SumoTech is great for instant &amp;#34;washed yesterday hair&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great quality product at a fair price. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. Arrived as stated.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that it was more of a jell.  This is hard wax and very hard to get into fingers or palm.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Paul Mitchell the Tea Tree product.  Seems a bit lighter, at least on my hair.</li>
    <li> works well unless your hair is longer</li>
    <li> I had already gotten this from the hair stylist so know that it&#x27;s a really nice product:  lots of shine without a lot of heavy hold, and a delightful smell.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of hold to keep my hair in line, and unlike other products the smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have short, fine hair and I was looking for a product to just add a little something and keep it in place. I like my hair to look a little dirty and tousled, and this works well. The shine keeps it from looking genuinely dirty, and the hold is just strong enough to keep my tousling from turning into craziness throughout the day. It smells really good, too, and you only need a tiny bit so the jar should last quite awhile.  This isn&#x27;t really a product for your spikes, mohawks or fauxhawks, but I imagine it could be useful for almost anything else.</li>
    <li> I was on vacation and having a terrible time with my hair in a high humidity climate. Nothing I brought helped. I went into a store with a lot of high end products and threw myself at the mercy of the salespeople. I have waist length straight fine hair, decent volume, no processing. One of the sales people recommended this. I tried it, loved it and have continued using it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a wax that adds shine to my hair unlike anything else. It tamps down frizz and also helps with winter static. I carry it with me for touch ups throughout the day. I really love the scent too. I don&#x27;t know what the fragrance is but it is delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 6 months I am only half way through this jar so it goes a very long way. I don&#x27;t set my hair or ask the product to hold a curl but I do use it to smooth out updos. I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is a little on the greasy side. I do like that it does give your hair some shine. Just remember to only a small amout of the product at a time.</li>
    <li> I keep buying it, works on my hair, smells good. The price is a little high, but the product last long if you have short hair. Cant tell for long but it does the job on short frizzy hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent Pomade, no other way to put it.  High shine but a light hold, perfect for thicker hair like mine.  The best part of this stuff is the smell, girls will be flocking to you in droves.  Already purchased my second jar.</li>
    <li> I like this better that the matte sumotec.  It is a little lighter and has some shine to it.  It smells pretty nice.  It still tends to weigh my hair down.  It also feels sort of sticky.  It is a very fine balance between too much and too little.  The jar will last forever.  My hair dresser loves this so maybe it is just me...  If it seems like it is drying out, zap it with your hair dryer,  it will loosen up!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price. This stuff is super expensive, so the only saving grace to that is you do not need much so it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair products, and this is my favorite.</li>
