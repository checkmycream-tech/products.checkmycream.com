<li> I would need 1/4 bottle of typical conditioners to do the same job.  </li>
<li> It was delivered to me on time as expected.</li>
<li> I use a little bit of this with a little bit of the Brazilian Blow Out Conditioner, and it goes a LONG way...a lot further than with the conditioner or Masque alone.  </li>
<li> I usually purchase the smaller bottle</li>
<li> After having a Brazilian Blowout it is helpful to use this at least weekly.</li>
<li> Felt like a expensive conditioner.</li>
<li> Obsessed!</li>
<li> Thinking it might be FAKE!!!!!</li>

    <li> I love this conditioner. I usually purchase the smaller bottle but it was nearly a $10 savings to go big. It was delivered to me on time as expected.</li>
    <li> Best Conditioner!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner out there!</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner out there. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Everything. I have thick/curly hair, and my daughter has very fine hair that gets knotted up easily, and this gets any tangles out of both of our hair without weighing it down too much.</li>
    <li> Oh my WOW recommend it Big Time Love it</li>
    <li> Great deal very pleased</li>
    <li> Smells citrusy n makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I use this as a leave-in conditioner because I have extremely coarse and kinky hair.  It&#x27;s great - I only need 1 1/2 pumps for hair that is shoulder length when wet.  I would need 1/4 bottle of typical conditioners to do the same job.  The moisture and strength in my hair lasts 2 days (brush it in on the 1st day, light rinse on the 2nd day).  My hair is much healthier since I started using this stuff almost a year ago.  Plus, it smells great - who doesn&#x27;t like that!</li>
    <li> My favorite!&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a conditioner, great product!</li>
    <li> This was the best price I have ever found! Great product. Makes your hair smoother and softer with every use.</li>
    <li> love the larger size great value! I would buy this again. the product seems to work the way it needs to.</li>
    <li> There is nothing that competes with this conditioner. It is AMAZING for your hair. Leaves my hair silky.</li>
    <li> I have alot of fine hair in various textures (dry, frizzy, wavy, curly, straight).  I love the subtle citrusy fragance and thick consistency of this mask that I plan to use as my regular conditioner. It makes my hair more managable and soft.</li>

    <li> The Brazilian Blowout Acai Deep conditioning masque works great! I have used it for 2-3 years and am very pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;The pump dispenser is also very convenient.</li>
    <li> After having a Brazilian Blowout it is helpful to use this at least weekly. Makes hair very soft and silky. Many other deep conditioning products are difficult to remove and as a result the Blowout does not last as long. I would highly recommend this product as a compliment to their daily shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I use a little bit of this with a little bit of the Brazilian Blow Out Conditioner, and it goes a LONG way...a lot further than with the conditioner or Masque alone.  Plus it is a stand up bottle with a pump....so much easier to access while in the shower!</li>
    <li> I love it.  The professional at hair salon try this on my hair, since then i get hook</li>
    <li> I have really damage hair from coloring way to much.  Thought it would help with that. Felt like a expensive conditioner. Was expecting more from it. I have been using for 3 months.</li>
    <li> This is the third time I have purchased this product and it works great for my hair.  I have long, coarse and curly hair; this product helps to keep it in line.  The true test was with the outdoor humidity, my kids laugh when my hair frizzes, but when I use this product it helped keep the frizz contained. :)</li>
    <li> Works great and so much cheaper than buying it in the hair salon</li>
    <li> I personally love the Acai brand and i usually get the anti-frizz conditioner (which I love). I tried this masque for a more deep conditioner and it&#x27;s a bit too thick, in my honest opinion. I&#x27;m going to go back to the anti-frizz conditioner by Acai. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Right product every time. I week order again.</li>
    <li> Obsessed! I can&#x27;t live without this mask. I use it as a regular conditioner.</li>
    <li> I receive the Brazillin Blowout service on my hair and wanted to use the entire line to make the results last longer.  I used these products 3 months after my last Brazillian Blowout service.  I usually would have the service redone by this time but with these products, I was able to extend my blowout another month! The conditioner made my hair very soft, moisturized and manageable.</li>
    <li> Perfect product...great larger size...live the pump!</li>
    <li> The product I bought from salon says to leave it in for 10-20 minutes.... This one says 1 minute.... Thinking it might be FAKE!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great &amp; I&#x27;m saving so much money buying it here.</li>
    <li> Yes good deal, i receive my order very soon,👍</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite hair conditioner.  There is nothing like it for curly dry hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is very course &amp; sometimes can be curly, in a weird way but more wavy then curly.  I now get quarterly Brazilian Blowouts &amp; this product helps to assist in keeping the chemicals from losing their effects of having straighter hair.</li>
