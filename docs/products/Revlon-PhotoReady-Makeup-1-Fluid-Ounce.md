      <li>love, love, love it.</li>
      <li>It gives a pretty good coverage too as I have acne scars.</li>
      <li>Love it, it apply so easily and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>i enjoy using very easy to blend and building it up isn&#x27;t a problem light weight foundaion</li>
      <li>this is a lil lite for my complexion but works great as a highlighter with foundation or good for dark undereye circles.</li>
      <li>But it is still a great product that smooths on nicely and gives you nice coverage and a little glow too!</li>
      <li>the term &#x27;photo ready&#x27; really appealed to me because that means it will give you great skin from ANY view</li>
      <li>The pros: Goes on smoothly ,Smells fine,Gives you a glow.</li>
      <li>i end up looking like supper orange after wearing it for a whole day!!!</li>
      <li>have to use the matching powder to get the full coverage that I need.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this Photo ready makeup and love this Revlon product I have used this color for about five years</li>
      <li>Use Q-Tips to get your money&#x27;s worth and recap the bottle until all the makeup is used up.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, and does the job well for a decent price.</li>
      <li>With first application, I got a near full coverage look and it stays on longer too (or maybe it just takes better with my smashbox primer than the thicker foundation)</li>
      <li>Normally I use Kat Von D Lock it Tattoo foundation, which as some of you probably know is very thick and provides flawless full coverage!</li>
      <li>i really like revlon foundations and their colorstay line alot!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to make the color just right since Revlon started changing foundation colors.  </li>
      <li>gorgeous color and its has tiny tiny gold flecks in it</li>
      <li>Pretty much stays on all day.</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon Revlon Photo Ready Foundation and also the powder.</li>
      <li>Love it and it&#x27;s not as smudgy as a lot of other foundations.</li>
      <li>This is hands down my favorite foundation.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>I feel like the product really smoothed over my face and it didn&#x27;t go into the few &#x27;fine lines&#x27; that I have.</li>
      <li>I was in need of new foundation</li>
      <li>that it doesn&#x27;t give COMPLETE coverage!</li>
      <li>that I&#x27;m a tad bit self conscious about.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this because I feel that it would give enough coverage to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like to wear that much makeup.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 32 with very few lines on my face, but the lines I do have also seemed much more obvious to me with this foundation.</li>
      <li>I have a few acne scars on my forehead and this product covered it right up!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it did a pretty good job, but it didn&#x27;t completely cover the black heads on my nose.</li>
      <li>I hate that I can&#x27;t find it in the local drug stores any more!!!</li>
      <li>The cons:  Not enough complete coverage.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m a longtime ColorStay user, but can&#x27;t find a color match this summer, so I decided to give this PhotoReady a try instead.  This was not a good foundation for my combination skin.  Even when paired with a primer, this foundation sunk into my skin and seemed to make every single pore on my face larger.  I&#x27;m 32 with very few lines on my face, but the lines I do have also seemed much more obvious to me with this foundation.</li>
    <li> Once Amazon intervened with the pricing ,as for some reason it was firstly over priced...:(...compared to the other shades...I used the product and it&#x27;s fantastic...great with my skin tone and looks great under studio lighting for modeling.</li>
    <li> Love it and it&#x27;s not as smudgy as a lot of other foundations. Pretty much stays on all day. A perfect color for me.</li>
    <li> Love it, it apply so easily and stays on all day. Unfortunately it is discontinued. Don&#x27;t know what I will be using next.</li>
    <li> Matched my skintone perfectly. Easy to apply, and does the job well for a decent price. Will definitely buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> i really like revlon foundations and their colorstay line alot! this is a lil lite for my complexion but works great as a highlighter with foundation or good for dark undereye circles. i enjoy using very easy to blend and building it up isn&#x27;t a problem light weight foundaion</li>
    <li> This product works well with mty skin tone, no grease. 24 hrs coverage. Beautiful...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love it. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice....</li>
    <li> I am totally pleased with the product ordered. The discontinued product by Revlon prompted my ordering and I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I love this make up. It&#x27;s Perfect for my skin tone. I hate that I can&#x27;t find it in the local drug stores any more!!!</li>
    <li> perfectly covers blemishes, acne spots and leaves your skin soft to the touch! excellent product! the tone is perfect for women of color!</li>
    <li> Apparently Revlon feels that dark skin women(not necessarily black)  aren&#x27;t who they want as their clientele, so i had to order from amazon. it was my perfect shade .. not complaints</li>
    <li> WHEN IM TAKING A PHOTO IT JUST LOOKS PERFECT</li>
    <li> I like the feel to this but I have to mix it with something lighter or else it looks dark &amp; orange on my skin. It gives a pretty good coverage too as I have acne scars.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this Photo ready makeup and love this Revlon product I have used this color for about five years</li>
    <li> PhotoReady makes my skin look flawless. This is hands down my favorite foundation. I love the consitency, the pump, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts!</li>
    <li> gorgeous color and its has tiny tiny gold flecks in it so when you take pictures you look illuminated.&lt;br /&gt;love, love,love</li>
    <li> this has too much of a red tone to it! i end up looking like supper orange after wearing it for a whole day!!!</li>
    <li> Can I just say that this makeup is the bomb? I got it for $10-12 from my local Ulta. Normally I use Kat Von D Lock it Tattoo foundation, which as some of you probably know is very thick and provides flawless full coverage! But, I tried this Revlon Photoready makeup on a whim and it works just as great as my $34 foundation. With first application, I got a near full coverage look and it stays on longer too (or maybe it just takes better with my smashbox primer than the thicker foundation) EITHER WAY I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I ordered cappuccino color, which matches my skin tone instead i got a nude color, too bad. Will not recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> This makeup is a nice addition to the REVLON COLORSTAY CAPPUCINO foundation.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to make the color just right since Revlon started changing foundation colors.  The bottle is not designed to be unscrewed or un-capped.  I pry it open with a can opener because just when you think you&#x27;re running out of makeup - there&#x27;s a LOT of foundation in the bottom of the bottle.  Use Q-Tips to get your money&#x27;s worth and recap the bottle until all the makeup is used up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the pros and cons in this. The pros: Goes on smoothly ,Smells fine,Gives you a glow. A little goes a long way.The cons:  Not enough complete coverage. Have to use the matching powder with it . I would recommend this because I feel that it would give enough coverage to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like to wear that much makeup. It has hardly any flaws.I was in need of new foundation so I decided to hit up Amazon and just try out some brands. I stumbled upon Revlon Photo Ready Foundation and also the powder. It looked like a quality product and the term &#x27;photo ready&#x27; really appealed to me because that means it will give you great skin from ANY view (weather it be photography). I tried it the next day and was really impressed! The smell wasn&#x27;t terrible like some foundations that I&#x27;ve tried and a little amount went a long way. I feel like the product really smoothed over my face and it didn&#x27;t go into the few &#x27;fine lines&#x27; that I have. I have a few acne scars on my forehead and this product covered it right up! I love that it covered those and my freckles that I&#x27;m a tad bit self conscious about. The thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is 1. that it doesn&#x27;t give COMPLETE coverage! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it did a pretty good job, but it didn&#x27;t completely cover the black heads on my nose. 2. I don&#x27;t like how I feel like have to use the matching powder to get the full coverage that I need. If I buy a product I like it to be COVERAGE COVERAGE COVERAGE and this didn&#x27;t give me all 3 of them! But it is still a great product that smooths on nicely and gives you nice coverage and a little glow too!</li>
