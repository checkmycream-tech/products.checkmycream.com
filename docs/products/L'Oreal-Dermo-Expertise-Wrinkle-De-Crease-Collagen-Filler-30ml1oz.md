    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and when I&#x27;m low, I go online to find it. I will continue to use it while it&#x27;s still available online.</li>
    <li> It seemed  rancid, which I denied to myself until I couldn&#x27;t any longer, and had to throw it out. I&#x27;d used this product for two year, and never before had it smelled like this.</li>
    <li> i got it and i love it , thanks</li>
    <li> The tube that I received was bad. The product smelled and was runny. I had used this product before and loved it because it worked. what I got sent this time must have been an expired batch.</li>
    <li> The product is not available in stores and now i know why. The tubes that we received are bad. The product smells.&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been using this product since many years and so we know that what we got shipped all the way to ondia was bad product</li>
    <li> Although I have tried multiple products, this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that has a visible affect on reducing my wrinkles.  Not only that, but it softens my skin and prepares it for smooth make up application. I love it :)</li>
    <li> I found this product to do what it says.  I add it after my makeup, too.  It does not show at all, but works all day.</li>
    <li> this does what it says difficult to find in stores though but really works well</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before in local stores and I have been happy with product purchase. But apparently, the product I bought from you must have been on stock for awhile. It smelled bad and texture was not consistent as when I purchased it from local stores.</li>
    <li> reduces appearance of wrinkles</li>
