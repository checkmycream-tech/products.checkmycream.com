      <li>I thought this would be a good product.</li>
      <li>I allowed it to absorb into my skin (which it does fairly</li>
      <li>it was so good</li>
      <li>If you want to put this on before you put on your work clothes, good luck because it&#x27;s oily and takes hours to absorb.</li>
      <li>Good luck if you try it.</li>
      <li>After I read good reviews about this product, I decided to try it.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and Amazon as well.</li>
      <li>An amazing online Store.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t think it fair of them to ask more of me when they wouldn&#x27;t even admit the possibility of a mistake.</li>

      <li>Will tell more in a couple more weeks.</li>
      <li>i will keep buying because i know it works :-)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this on Amazon and will be telling everyone I know about this product.</li>
      <li>but then again, I&#x27;ve come to realize that many of the products from fair&amp;white works.</li>
      <li>I love it and will continue to use when needed.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what ingredient causes it to work that fast, but I am happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>so no sealed top, and no protective cap over the pump.</li>
      <li>They felt in love with this one for years</li>
      <li>and I believe they will disappear after 2 more weeks if I keep up the routine.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t tell you how many times a day to use it.  </li>
      <li>yet i think maybe i should used it more longer</li>
      <li>I ordered two more bottles.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;ll probably buy more as soon</li>
      <li>I am glad that I went ahead and bought this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try something else to see if it does any better.</li>
      <li>to be consistent but there is good,</li>
      <li>It worked great on my chest and hands it got rid of them completely.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is the only place I have been able to find a great price for the product.  </li>
      <li>YOU WANNA GET UR BEAUTIFUL FACE BACK</li>
      <li>I used acnescription because I also get fine bumps from time to time that just wont go</li>
      <li>No way could I use it on my face unless I want huge pores which always seem to expand and get clogged when I feed them oily substances like this.</li>
      <li>You can have the product from Amazon for free Shipping too.</li>
      <li>Now I am proud of myself because my beauty face is back again..   </li>
      <li>I am of Afican descent with light skin</li>
      <li>Thanks for an effective product.</li>
      <li>And if you do it right, I&#x27;m sure you will get results (AND NO I do not work nor am I getting any commissions or incentives for writing this testimonial).</li>
      <li>So excited...</li>
      <li>I recieved this product, without it&#x27;s original box.</li>
      <li>I have resolved that my goal is to get those dark spots fade or gone ideally, why not stick to the product it works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After I read these reviews, I was excited to try this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered products from fair &amp; white before</li>
      <li>so I think it will take a couple more of this product to really see result.  </li>
      <li>I think it is a good product but was not necessary for me.  </li>
      <li>I suspect the people who write those good reviews above are somehow related to the company of this product, and they want to increase the sales to make more  money out of the innocent customers.</li>
      <li>I went through this rather quickly in a matter of weeks too.</li>
      <li>, i used it for a week and saw a diffences in skin all the dark marks was getting lighter great product.</li>
      <li>Packaging though is pleasant, but I would not really recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This product works fast!!  </li>
      <li>I will be repurchasing AND the best part is that this product does not contain the harmful ingredient of HQ (hydroquinone) that many other lightening products have (HQ is known to cause cancer and banned in other countries).  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works!!</li>
      <li>As of now I am trying to find more natural products and before I buy anything I read the ingredients!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Now if I could only find an effective treatment for undereye puffiness.</li>
      <li>its worth giving it a try.</li>
      <li>/&gt;P.S.:  If anyone would be kind enough to reply to this post with something that they have tried...and WORKED...</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll try their cream or see if they have a gel instead which gets absorbed easier.</li>
      <li>I will say I had some success but not a lot.  </li>
      <li>I would put the Q-tip right up to the sprayer and then apply it to my cheek.</li>
      <li>I received it in good time, however, there were no instructions either on the container nor anything written from the supplier, other than to use a cotton ball!  </li>
      <li>but so far it has not really made me happy.</li>
      <li>I am placing a second order right now just to be sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
      <li>Also as far as the SPF, any SPF that is 30 and is not oily (I dont like oily) should be fine.</li>
      <li>I used it in combination with the Fair and White strong bleaching treatment every other night.</li>
      <li>when it comes to this kind of product you need to be aware that everyone its different and because it worked for me does not mean it will work for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and can&#x27;t wait to purchase my next bottle.</li>
      <li>It will most likely seep through your clothes.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for more than ten year</li>
      <li>Um first off, this has the same ingredients as the fair &amp; white serum, or so they claim..</li>
      <li>So far so good, except the contents had leaked snd the bubble pack was dripping and the envelope was wet.</li>
      <li>story short, part of the product line in the regimen was Fair &amp; White.</li>
      <li>I was influenced by the positive reviews for this product</li>
      <li>Using in addition with other lotion from fair &amp; white and the result is super.</li>
      <li>I have very light sunspots that I wanted to cut off at the pass, and this has worked fine as long as I use it regularly.</li>
      <li>i couldn&#x27;t believe,   it would work that fast.  </li>
      <li>but at this price you don&#x27;t have much to lose.  </li>
      <li>Oh, thanks so much.  </li>
      <li>Since the container is tin there is no way to know how much was lost, or when you are running out.</li>
      <li>Thanks again.    </li>
      <li>Some products I used were very expensives...</li>
      <li>Sometimes I used it once a day, some times twice a day depending on how much it irritated my face.  </li>
      <li>It is fast.</li>
      <li>and it did absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>but the cost was reasonable.  </li>
      <li>I was also using obagi clear 3 for more than a year prescribed by a doctor and Later found out</li>
      <li>I bought this as it appeared in a package and seemed a fair deal, but had to give it away as I found the other two items were sufficient for my needs and did the same thing this product would have done.  </li>
      <li>I am glad that this product worked for other people (according to the reviews here), but it DID NOT work for me.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m scared to use it. I regret buying it.😫</li>
    <li> Purchased this product, it does in fact work, however that is mostly due to the fact that it DOES contain Hydronoquinone. I discontinued use immediately. If you want the proof go to the company&#x27;s direct website and find the product there. It list the ingredient. www.fairandwhite.com.</li>
    <li> i got this product to lighten up my dark freckeles, and after  a couple times using it, it left marks on my face so you can see where its been!! it took 4 weeks to fade it away! would not reoommend for freckles!!!</li>
    <li> I have had brown spots on my face from too much sun when I was younger. Over the years I have tried prescription strength hydroquinone, had them frozen off maybe 12 times, and had laser treatment three times. It all worked out the same, after the treated skin healed the brown spots were right back again as before. I have been using this product twice a day (am &amp; pm) for about two weeks, and am amazed that my brown spots seem to be slowly disappearing. I am placing a second order right now just to be sure I don&#x27;t run out. My only complaint was that the little container has a pump top that is neither sealed, caped, nor protected in any way. As a result some of the product leaked out into the bubble wrap used to ship it. Since the container is tin there is no way to know how much was lost, or when you are running out. I just shake it to see if I can detect any fluid left. The seller advises that is the way they are shipped to them...so no sealed top, and no protective cap over the pump. But bottom line, it does seem to work so it&#x27;s works the few bucks to keep at it (compared to all of the money I have laid out (wasted) on dermatologist, and their creams, etc.</li>
    <li> this product does work! i couldn&#x27;t believe,   it would work that fast.  i used it for two to three days, and i could see my   dark spot fading away.i think everybody need   to buy this product! trust me, i have had dark spot  for almost nine years, and i&#x27;d bought some products   that didn&#x27;t work. but this product is a must buy   for everyone.</li>
    <li> My skin has suffered from moderate melasma from birth control for the past 2 years- it go so bad I tried just about everything, even prescription creams. After I read good reviews about this product, I decided to try it. I used it in combination with the Fair and White strong bleaching treatment every other night. I saw results immediately! It does leave your skin red for a day or so on the places you put the cream, but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s work for me!! I used the Fair &amp; White Dark Spot Remover twice a day. It&#x27;s took about a month to make my uneven skin tone barely to see!! I&#x27;m sure this product can solve some recent problems about dark spot and uneven skin tone but I cannot say about long time problems!!</li>
    <li> So yes, it smells great. However, it&#x27;s like Bio Oil in a bottle. I never expected it to spray clear oil, which is very weird. There were no instructions and it had no cap on the metal bottle either. I did notice it lightened some marks around my ankles, but I didn&#x27;t use it just by itself.  No way could I use it on my face unless I want huge pores which always seem to expand and get clogged when I feed them oily substances like this. I went through this rather quickly in a matter of weeks too. If you want to put this on before you put on your work clothes, good luck because it&#x27;s oily and takes hours to absorb. It will most likely seep through your clothes.  I think I&#x27;ll try their cream or see if they have a gel instead which gets absorbed easier.</li>
    <li> First of all I received my order sooner than expected. Been using fair &amp; white dark spot remover for two weeks now and have started noticing my dark spots are not as dark as they were. I also use it on my knee and heels, so yes it appears to be working! Am happy with the product!</li>
    <li> the container leaked &amp; the package was wet.  I e-mailed the seller about this ^ they wannted a picture.  I do not have a camera &amp; my phone is not capble of loading apicture.  The container was not DAMAGED it LEAKED</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one month, twice a day, morning and night, and sadly the spots on my face have gotten darker.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> How can i use this product? does anyone knows? it has no instruction or something like this, please help me. i&#x27;ve get my product yesterday and i don&#x27;t understand how to use.</li>
    <li> Some years back, I consulted a skin solutions center, who actually had/has (last I checked) clientele from famous actors concerning skin discolorations, hyper-pigmentation, back and body acne. This place prescribed a regimen of products and it worked wonders. I couldn&#x27;t keep it up, so I had to discontinue, but the results did not reverse itself (they maintained as long as I maintained them).&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, part of the product line in the regimen was Fair &amp; White. Now I just recently tried the dark spot remover and tried it&lt;br /&gt;consistently for a month. Here are my results and this is also to help others out who are looking for results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. With any fade/lightening product you need a scrub to prep your skin and remove the dead skin cells. I used \\&quot;Acnescription(tm) Exfoliating Acne Cleanser - Patricia Wexler M.D\\&quot; plus a scrub glove to work the scrub beads into my skin. I used acnescription because I also get fine bumps from time to time that just wont go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I used the liquid at night after cleansing my skin with the product above and buffing with the scrub glove. I allowed it to absorb into my skin (which it does fairly quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. With every lightening/fade product you MUST *MUST* use a sunscreen during the day to prevent further darkening, reversals or other sun damage. I used Skin Brightening Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 - Patricia Wexler M.D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing this regimen, my skin looked brighter, clearer, hyper-pigmentation that NO OTHER product got rid of(except for the lightner that was provided in the kit by the skin center (which they put in a no-named bottle :-( so I dont know what it was) was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe. No other product has worked this well. I will be repurchasing AND the best part is that this product does not contain the harmful ingredient of HQ (hydroquinone) that many other lightening products have (HQ is known to cause cancer and banned in other countries).  I hope this help. And if you do it right, I&#x27;m sure you will get results (AND NO I do not work nor am I getting any commissions or incentives for writing this testimonial). As a matter of fact, I rarely write testimonials but after coming back to repurchase and seeing the negative comments, I assumed that those individuals probably left out or were unaware of the 3 steps necessary that I wrote above for them to see optimal results.  HOPE THIS HELPS! Also as far as the SPF, any SPF that is 30 and is not oily (I dont like oily) should be fine. I understand Pat Wexler line may be expensive...</li>
    <li> I have very, very fair skin with freckles and symmetrical brown patches on both sides of my face...  Apparently these spots are due to prolonged use of birth control, and are very unattractive.  So I have been using all kinds of cremes and lotions on my face to get rid of the patches...and nothing seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I read these reviews, I was excited to try this product.  Well, when I received the product (promptly), I noticed that there did not seem to be any type of ingredients listed that are associated with &#x27;skin lightening&#x27;.  Odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short...I applied it daily to the patchy areas, and nothing happened except it really dried my skin out in those areas.  So now I have brown AND scaly patches on my face.  Wonderful.  I am glad that this product worked for other people (according to the reviews here), but it DID NOT work for me.  So, the search goes on.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.:  If anyone would be kind enough to reply to this post with something that they have tried...and WORKED...I&#x27;m all ears!!! Thank you!  ~C</li>
    <li> I just dont see any benefits to this product.&lt;br /&gt; It hasnt help remove any old age/liver spot.&lt;br /&gt;Ive used it for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I had a bit of pigmentation in a scar and I used it on that and in less than a week I was able to see results, the part became lighter and sometimes I still apply a little be. I read some reviews about some of the products I was using and unfortunately I found out some of them have hydroquinone and this is one of then. I was also using obagi clear 3 for more than a year prescribed by a doctor and Later found out it has 4% of this carcinogen :( As of now I am trying to find more natural products and before I buy anything I read the ingredients! LIVE AND LEARN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin depigmentation&lt;br /&gt;In human medicine, hydroquinone is used as a topical application in skin whitening to reduce the color of skin as it does not have the same predisposition to cause dermatitis as metol does. This use is banned in some countries, including the member states of the European Union under Directive 76/768/EEC:1976.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations. The FDA stated that hydroquinone cannot be ruled out as a potential carcinogen.This conclusion was reached based to the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis, mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell ademonas. Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin</li>
    <li> when it comes to this kind of product you need to be aware that everyone its different and because it worked for me does not mean it will work for you. It work great for me. It is fast. I used it to remove dark spots on my underarms and I saw results in 1 week!! I cant warranty this will work for you but its worth giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I have never used a spot remover that was not overdrying.  This goes on smooth, and a couple of days later you notice slight peeling of the affected area.  Only a small amount is necessary, and this will last for awhile.  Very happy with this purchase, and shipping was super fast.  This was the first item to arrive from an order that contained 4 other products.</li>
    <li> I got this to lighten some freckles on my face.  I will say I had some success but not a lot.  First off, I&#x27;m not thrilled by the directions, or lack there of.  It doesn&#x27;t tell you how many times a day to use it.  I like my directions to be explicit.  Sometimes I used it once a day, some times twice a day depending on how much it irritated my face.  It did make my face red and some days it seemed to be worse than others but was bareable.  This is supposed to be a spot treatment but I used it all over my face so it didnt last as long as it would have normally so that could have affected my result. I&#x27;m going to try something else to see if it does any better.</li>
    <li> I had originally been using Clinique dark spot corrector and was ecstatic when I saw some improvements after 2-3 weeks that I purchased another one for a hefty $40 for the small bottle.  Days later, I saw reviews for Fair &amp; White and for half the price of Clinique&#x27;s I decided to try it out.  Have never heard of the brand but the cost was reasonable.  To my amazement, improvements were showing up after 3-4 days!!!! I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and live in year-round sunny AZ.  I have maybe 5-6 spots on my right cheek and a few on my left side. I would say they are about 90% gone after 4 weeks now!! Hardly visible - even without makeup. During the day, I do wear a moisturizer with SPF because I know the dark spots will come right back if I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m so glad I found this on Amazon and will be telling everyone I know about this product. The product came without a box or direction but I was applying it in the morning and evening before bed. I would put the Q-tip right up to the sprayer and then apply it to my cheek. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so it didn&#x27;t sting me as some reviewers say but my cheek did get flushed (pinkish) after applying it.</li>
    <li> Great and immediate results.  Exellent product for discoloring skins.  Totally satified with this soap and highly recommend it. A must purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this as it appeared in a package and seemed a fair deal, but had to give it away as I found the other two items were sufficient for my needs and did the same thing this product would have done.  I think it is a good product but was not necessary for me.  It does work but was an unnecessary purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I tried a lot of products to treat the dark spots on my face specially in vain FOR 8 YEARS. I was ugly, ashamed of myself at my Work Place , hiding from cameras because no Make Up was able to cover my large spots. Some products I used were very expensives... Then I decided to see a Dermatologist... She prescribed the hydroquinone 4% to treat what she called the Melasma.   I didn&#x27;t have money to buy my prescription at my Pharmacy. Very expensive...  So, I went Online, looking for the products who content the Hydroquinone 4%. I chose to try this product because of the Reviews some Ladies rode for it.   I bought Online two from BEAUTY4FAMILY. An amazing online Store. No problem  with the shipping and the billing...You can have the product from Amazon for free Shipping too. I got my third one from Amazon with no problem with the Shipping and the billing to continue to treat my elbows and others dark spots on my body.  BELIEVE ME, IT WORKS !!! Now I am proud of myself because my beauty face is back again..   I am a black woman with light skin : the Sun, the abrasion or any cut let the dark spots on my skin... But I can handle this problem now with FAIR &amp; WHITE DARK SPOT REMOVER.  BUY IT WITHOUT HESITATION !!!</li>
    <li> It has taken me some time to write this however it has been on my to do list. When I received this it had no lid. I corresponded with the company and they insisted they would never mail out anything without a lid, despite the fact that I had received it without a lid and was telling them so. In order to recieve a refund, I was told I had to fill out a form, I dont have extra time and I didn&#x27;t think it fair of them to ask more of me when they wouldn&#x27;t even admit the possibility of a mistake. Thanfully Amozon interceded and returned my money. I would not do business with this company ever!!</li>
    <li> Hi! I&#x27;m Unhappy with that order,because they are so bad it&#x27;s without the lid and they&#x27;re west so I thruway.so bad</li>
    <li> At this point it is an okay product.  It does have a slight sting when applied for a few seconds. I am of Afican descent with light skin so I think it will take a couple more of this product to really see result.  Some of the spots on my face are fading a little. I use it on my arm as well.  Will tell more in a couple more weeks.</li>
    <li> I am using two products for age spots. I think this product does work though not sure. It is hard to spray on your face accurately and it ends up running down your face. It stings a little but not badly, except on my arm, the skin got irritated, but oddly, not on my face. It has taken a month but there has been a diminishing of the dark color but it has not disappeared. Still, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work at all.</li>
    <li> this is a fast acting product. I started to see results in two days it was so good I ordered two more bottles. it even dried my acne out. it actually works overnight, in the morning I was amazed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this (based on reviews) for undereye darkness and it did absolutely nothing.  Don&#x27;t wast your money on this!</li>
    <li> I bought this expecting I was going to be wasting my money yet again.  I was very pleasantly surprised this was the ONLY product to fade my freckles and get rid of dark spots on my face.  It worked great on my chest and hands it got rid of them completely.  My face looks great and I love the results of this product.  Amazon is the only place I have been able to find a great price for the product.  I know not all products work for everyone but at this price you don&#x27;t have much to lose.  I love it and will continue to use when needed.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed, not only with this product, but also with the supplier.  I received it in good time, however, there were no instructions either on the container nor anything written from the supplier, other than to use a cotton ball!  Oh, thanks so much.  Two emails were sent to supplier, one through Amazone and one myself, but I never received a response from them.  Thanks again.    As a result, I would not recommend this product to anyone, nor would I advise anyone to purchase from this supplier. Also, I didn&#x27;t want to rate this product at all, but it bounced back to me so I only gave them one star.  They don&#x27;t deserve it tho.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to get rid of a brown spot I was getting on my forehead, and now a week of use only at night it&#x27;s already lighter my skin feels very smooth it also shrunk my pores I Wasn&#x27;t expecting for this product to work so well and it does better than any other product i have used i will keep buying because i know it works :-)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it. A huge disappointment and waste of money. I used it for two months and saw absolutely no results.</li>
    <li> i have been using this spray for awhile now and see no result yet i think maybe i should used it more longer</li>
    <li> Irritated my skin, did not see any changes. Luck of the draw i suppose. Good luck if you try it.</li>
    <li> People think this stuff causes cancer.  Even so called experts say so.  I did my research and a leading dermatologist explains that it does not.  It is the same stuff Michael Jackson used only the active ingredient goes by a different name and he used a prescription which is twice as strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a skin bleach.  It tells the dark skin cells to come back lighter, over time, as your skin dies and regenerates.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!! I&#x27;ve had embarrassing acne scars on my back and chest since I was 14 yrs old. And I have tried everything.. Been using it for a month now and some spots have faded away altogether, others are fading slowly but surely. So excited...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and Amazon as well. I received the product within two days after making my purchase and promptly began using the product. I Immediate began to notice a difference in my skin within the first few days. I am pleased to report to (you) the reader, that this product (Dark Spot Remover) really works but then again, I&#x27;ve come to realize that many of the products from fair&amp;white works. I&#x27;ve finally found a skin care line that works for my skin. I have combination skin that scars very easily so to have discovered a skin care line that works was to say the least, a revelation of sorts. I&#x27;m satisfied and can&#x27;t wait to purchase my next bottle.</li>
    <li> I bought 10 of this one and gave to my mom, my auties and my mom&#x27;s friend. They felt in love with this one for years</li>
    <li> Awsome product!!! It really helped me fade my dark spots on my face. I am glad that I went ahead and bought this product.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about 1 week and already many of my dark spots are gone and the others have substantially faded.  This product works fast!!  I don&#x27;t know what ingredient causes it to work that fast, but I am happy with the results.  Thanks for an effective product.</li>
    <li> this product did not do anything for me, it had no change on my legs if not for palmers my leg wont look better dont waste ur money.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
    <li> I thought this cream was going to work well for me, but after using it for quite a while, there was no difference to my dark scars. I&#x27;m sure it is working for a lot other people, but I&#x27;m afraid not for me!</li>
    <li> this product didnt work at all on my dark spots, i wasted my money! i do not recommend it at all</li>
    <li> I have used this product religiously teice a day for the past 2 1/2 weeks as I have purchased this product twice but so far I have not noticed any big difference. A minor fading but not what I expected. I will continue to use until my 2 cannisters are empty and see if using it longer might help but so far it has not really made me happy.</li>
    <li> Using this product daily, not sure how effective it is. Giving it a little more time. Only started using it a month ago</li>
    <li> Um first off, this has the same ingredients as the fair &amp; white serum, or so they claim.. I bought the item, been using it haven&#x27;t seen any results, besides making my skin extra dry. I&#x27;m trying to understand how it has been working for other people? Its just scented oil...</li>
    <li> Using in addition with other lotion from fair &amp; white and the result is super. Love it. Dark spot started fading away.</li>
    <li> I brought this product based on the good reviews, but as always it is a disappointment.   I have two sun damaged spots on my face. I was hoping this product could fade the brown color a little bit. I would never imagine that this product could actually completely remove the brown spots, because it is not a prescription from a doctor. To my disappointment, after using two weeks and followed the instruction strictly, I have not seen any changes at all. I will not buy this product again or recommend any other people to buy this product in the future.  I suspect the people who write those good reviews above are somehow related to the company of this product, and they want to increase the sales to make more  money out of the innocent customers.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. I was influenced by the positive reviews for this product but now I can only believe that they were fake.  This product does nothing! I have used it for the last 4 or 5 weeks with absolutely no change to the dark spots on my face. I will never buy it again and  I will also be skeptical of a few positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fair &amp; White Dark Spot Remover twice daily for 2 weeks.  My dark spots are beginning to fade and I believe they will disappear after 2 more weeks if I keep up the routine.  I&#x27;ve tried several other products and have been hugely disappointed so I am relieved that this might be working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if I could only find an effective treatment for undereye puffiness.</li>
    <li> This dark spot remover did not work for me.  I might not have used it correctly or long enough.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product, without it&#x27;s original box. It came in a bubble mailing envelope, with tape wrapped around the nozzle instead of a cap.  The tape tape was wet, as if the contents had leaked out! I haven&#x27;t used the prodcut yet, I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> Not really practical for use on the face as it looks like an oil slick. Packaging though is pleasant, but I would not really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tend to try new things. I thought this would be a good product. I received the product with out a cap. So I was not happy about that. I did not get any instructions on how to use the product.</li>
    <li> This is a very bad product it does not work at all and it is a big time waste of money please do not buy this</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me and I used it two and three times a day.</li>
    <li> Because it really works , I starting seeing result  in 3 days. Dark spots are lighter and I would recommend it  to a friend .</li>
    <li> It does not work for what is intended, although the pores are very nice now. The spray bottle ensures you are going to waste product because the las part wont come out</li>
    <li> This seems to work if I were able to use it every day, but I have oily skin and when I put it on my dark spot on my cheek, eventually I break out there.  It has lightened but it&#x27;s not  gone.  If your skin is dry, this is certainly worth a try.</li>
    <li> THAT PRODUCT, OH MY GOODNESS MY FACE WAS DARK I HAVE USED THAT PRODUCT FOR ONLY ONE WEEK. THAT PRODUCT WILL HELP YOU WITH UR SKIN GUYS.IF YOU WANNA GET UR BEAUTIFUL FACE BACK GET THAT PRODUCT.THAT PRODUCT FADE ALL MY DARK SPOTS.[[ASIN:B00174LGSI Fair &amp; White Dark Spot Remover]]</li>
    <li> This product did not even come in a box or packaged. The packaging it arrived in was wet in the insides from this product leaking. It did not look sanitary and immediately threw it in the garbage. I would never order from this seller again! I&#x27;ve ordered products from fair &amp; white before and i&#x27;ve all came packaged with a quailty logo attached.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in an brown envelope with the product wrapped in bubble pack. So far so good, except the contents had leaked snd the bubble pack was dripping and the envelope was wet. I dumped the bubble pack and envelope, stupid me, because the company wanted visual proof of the problem before doing what? When some unknown chemical leaks you don&#x27;t let it sit around and wait to take pictures, nor do I know what would show up except a stain on the envelope. My suggestion to all future buyers: if the company doesn&#x27;t know how to ship a product, don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;(There was no protective cap on the bottle).</li>
    <li> to be consistent but there is good,</li>
    <li> Really works well and in just a week my dark spots on my face are disappearing like magic. Even the people around me are noticing the changes in my face. I can recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> had high hopes and it didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> It actually works. My dark spots actually seem to be fading. I have been using this product for 1 month.</li>
    <li> Shipment was open  and drop the fluid</li>
    <li> this bottle is so small please read the oz on the bottle but it works  100%  does what it say, i used it for a week and saw a diffences in skin all the dark marks was getting lighter great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the lower reviews. I have used many \\&quot;dark spot removers\\&quot; expensive and cheaper products. I saw a difference within in one week on two dark pigmented spots on my hand that were approximately 1/4 inch. Extremely satisfied, be sure and add a good sun screen. Update 9-9-2013 need to constantly apply or spots come back quickly!</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money it didnt work at all</li>
    <li> I try this product for maybe about two weeks and didn&#x27;t see any difference on my sun spots.  I did follow the instructions and apply it twice a day. the skin does pill a little.  I hate pressing it and it squirts out which I think the amount is too much for little spots of sun marks.</li>
    <li> still using it but it is slowing working on my dark spots and i&#x27;ll probably buy more as soon i run out</li>
    <li> This stuff really gets rid of dark spots, like the pimple scars or sun spots. I had dark spots because of the acne I used to have and it really took them off. I put it on every night on every spot. And after about five days they disappeared.</li>
    <li> Didnt notice any real significant chage with the spots on my face. Some of them dimmed down a bit but they did not completly disappear like I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all, don&#x27;t buy it. Came with no instructions. I read prior reviews to learn application issues.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my black spots using small amounts every day for a few weeks; a bigger size would be nice</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than ten year it&#x27;s great for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have very light sunspots that I wanted to cut off at the pass, and this has worked fine as long as I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a bit of a difference at all, still have massive black spots and it&#x27;s been well over 4 months.</li>
    <li> did nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product 3 times and finally realized it did work, though it took some time. After tired of buying and trying many different dark spot remover, I bought this one after reading the good reviews. I tried it for two weeks and didn&#x27;t see the results, I threw it away. A few weeks later, I thought that I should have given it more time, so I bought it again. I used it twice per day with Q-tip for about a month and noticed that my dark spot faded, though not totally gone. Then, I read a review saying this product contains HQ that could cause skin cancer. Guess what, I tossed the bottle again and starting my searching among those high end products of dark spot remover. After searching and trying with no luck, I bought this one again knowing it actually worked before. I have resolved that my goal is to get those dark spots fade or gone ideally, why not stick to the product it works. I actually used up the third bottle, one spot is gone and another is faded. I have to say, it works faster if the acne scar is new, sun spot takes longer time. 4 stars means that I am not sure if it works on age spots or not. It did takes patience and time to do it and time to see the result. Hope this helps, bottom line is everyone is different and this is my experience.</li>
