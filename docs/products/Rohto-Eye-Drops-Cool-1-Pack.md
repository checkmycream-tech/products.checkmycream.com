      <li>Cooling feeling is interesting.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of eyedrops over the years, and I&#x27;ve always felt that I might as well just build an eyewash station and pour water on my eyes.</li>
      <li>These eye drops worked better then</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>And yes, your eyes can feel energetic-</li>
      <li>Glad I found on the internet.</li>
      <li>Eyes are too precious to play around with.</li>
      <li>On a hot or windy day, these really are the best and just make your eyes feel so refreshed!</li>
      <li>and he used alcohol drops to wipe away the top part of somebody&#x27;s eyeball first!</li>
      <li>But this I took a huge chance</li>
      <li>I enthusiastically recommend this product and it&#x27;s more than worth the five dollars and forty-nine cents</li>
      <li>Firstly, I like that the menthol is not too strong so it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, and it is refreshing to the eyes.</li>
      <li>Five stars for  Rohto Cool Eye Drops, Lubricant, Redness Relief - MENTHOLATUM INC .  </li>
      <li>Great eye drops, original found green bottle at Walmart, but can no longer find.  </li>
      <li>If you need powerful redness relief, you need Rohto.</li>
      <li>This little bottle of goodness works amazing !</li>
      <li>This is replacing your eyes with those of some kind of polar bear / falcon hybrid.</li>
      <li>Do your research first, folks.</li>
      <li>wear strong glasses, I use computers all through the night, and I have to sleep with a mask most nights because otherwise my eyes just feel dead in the morning.</li>
      <li>I actually enjoy the sudden burst of freshness in my eyes and it wakes me right up.</li>
      <li>Based on the positive reviews for this product, I decided to order one to try.</li>
      <li>Since I go to uni, I stare at computers pretty much every day.</li>
      <li>Not sure if its the menthol factor that does that, but it does feel good after the sting.</li>
      <li>These drops works so much better than other eye drops, while it feels like dropping acid in your eyes the first time you use them, you&#x27;ll get use to it.</li>
      <li>One day I got a free sample of Rohto V, and I&#x27;ve never looked back.</li>
      <li>#1 thanks.</li>
      <li>some Rohto V. This is not just putting water on your eyes, this is shoving an industrial freezer into your eye sockets and setting it to absolute zero.</li>
      <li>My eyes get a lot of use and strain and these eyedrops really relieve and refresh them.</li>
      <li>haha  </li>
      <li>Ever wake up with really tired/red eyes?</li>
      <li>Unless there&#x27;s no such thing as completely removing the redness, but I wish that this could do a bit more.</li>
      <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve come across that truly refreshes my eyes and gets rid of 90% - 100% of all the red in my eyes within less than four minutes and they STAY that way for a good 12 to 15 to hours.  </li>
      <li>Turns out alcohol (the main ingredient in these drops) actually disintegrates the top layer of your eye, exposing your cornea and setting you up for possible corneal damage.</li>
      <li>clear out my sinuses too!!</li>
      <li>They feel great after a long hard look at a computer monitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only thing you have to get used to is the &#x27;minty fresh&#x27; feeling they have.</li>
      <li>That minty feeling does not bother me, but for more sensitive eyes, it might take a few times to get used to the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>&amp; it really has a cooling affect to it, and it takes away all reddness &amp; brightens the white of your eye, really makes your eyes brighter.</li>
      <li>Not to mention boys who are a bit straining on the old peepers!</li>
      <li>These eye drops are nothing short of intense!</li>
      <li>it feels like someone took your eyes, and gave it a nice clean cold water bath.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s helpful for people trying to wake themselves up, clear up bloodshot eyes from those nights</li>
      <li>The redness was gone and my eyes did in fact feel clear and alert.</li>
      <li>you can really feel this stuff working, instantly, and</li>
      <li>A warning for those of you who have never used it before: the first few times you use it is really stings.</li>
      <li>Overall I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>O_O &lt;--</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive at the grocery store, but on amazon it&#x27;s priced well as long as you get 4 or more of them in one order.</li>
      <li>Want to take your eyes from tired and red, to alive and energetic?</li>
      <li>Also, some reviews mentioned that your eyes could get used to this and may become worse in terms of redness when you stop using the product, thus you find the need to use it more often.</li>
      <li>This is apparently a well known medical fact, and doctors have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>I also wear eye makeup pretty much everyday, as well as my contact lenses.</li>

<li> Unlike other eyedrops, these really seem to help with dryness, any sort of pain, or other discomfort.</li>
<li> After using, there&#x27;s a period of time where I can&#x27;t see, but once vision clears, I usually feel much</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years for my dry and red eyes.</li>
<li> I had lasik surgery five years ago, and my eyes are always dry and red.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been a contact lens wearer for 20+ years and have constantly struggled with dry and reddish eyes...</li>
<li> I work in front of a computer and under harsh office lighting, to the point that I frequently have to take breaks to rest my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Needless to say, it&#x27;s always in that tiny pocket on the right side of my jeans</li>
<li> I am afraid that I could be experiencing that right now so thinking to just visit a proper eye doctor and get prescription eye drops.</li>
<li> so I do not know the long term effects of everyday use.</li>
<li> This is extreme redness relief- the sort of extreme you see in energy drink commercials.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried Visine and other over-the-counter eye lubricants/redness-reliever products and none have come close to the results of Rohto-V.</li>
<li> You might want to bring something to bite down</li>
<li> I really need to stay up late on a project, or when I&#x27;ve just had it with tired eyes, I pop</li>
<li> curse at nothing for another half a minute and the feeling begins to subside.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m disappointed that it does not really take the red out completely.</li>
<li> He handed me a little bottle of Rohto.</li>
<li> I did a little research on eye redness.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it EVERYDAY because this product works by constricting the blood vessels in the eye</li>
<li> so my eyes always end up looking tired and red.</li>
<li> even if this did get rid of my redness (which it did NOT), I still wouldn&#x27;t use it, at least not more than twice a year.</li>
<li> and you can&#x27;t see for at least 10-20 seconds maybe longer.</li>
<li> I can never use plain eye drops again!!  </li>
<li> , i use it also while i study sometimes when my eyes get tired</li>
<li> Not perfect, but they do help.</li>
<li> I tried the Rohto Ice and that is the worse feeling EVER!!!</li>

    <li> I tried the Rohto Ice and that is the worse feeling EVER!!! But this I took a huge chance and I love it. It works and feels good to the eyes. The ICE burns like hell and you can&#x27;t see for at least 10-20 seconds maybe longer. It feels like longer. This \\&quot;COOL\\&quot; is soothing and is like a eye drop should be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing, don&#x27;t ever give the ICE to a friend to put in without a warning. You can&#x27;t imagine the re-action.</li>
    <li> Since I go to uni, I stare at computers pretty much every day. I also wear eye makeup pretty much everyday, as well as my contact lenses. Not to mention boys who are a bit straining on the old peepers! Haha..jk. My eyes get a lot of use and strain and these eyedrops really relieve and refresh them. Unlike other eyedrops, these really seem to help with dryness, any sort of pain, or other discomfort. They feel great after a long hard look at a computer monitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you have to get used to is the &#x27;minty fresh&#x27; feeling they have. That minty feeling does not bother me, but for more sensitive eyes, it might take a few times to get used to the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that putting these eyedrops in once or twice a day is sufficient, as these eyedrops do have a bit of HCl in them. So don&#x27;t overdose, it might not be good for the chemistry of your eyes. But I would still definitely recommend these to any computer users out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Want to take your eyes from tired and red, to alive and energetic? You need Rohto V. And yes, your eyes can feel energetic- I never thought that was possible, before now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear strong glasses, I use computers all through the night, and I have to sleep with a mask most nights because otherwise my eyes just feel dead in the morning. I work in front of a computer and under harsh office lighting, to the point that I frequently have to take breaks to rest my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I really need to stay up late on a project, or when I&#x27;ve just had it with tired eyes, I pop some Rohto V. This is not just putting water on your eyes, this is shoving an industrial freezer into your eye sockets and setting it to absolute zero. This is replacing your eyes with those of some kind of polar bear / falcon hybrid. This is extreme redness relief- the sort of extreme you see in energy drink commercials. You might want to bring something to bite down on- you can really feel this stuff working, instantly, and the effect lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of eyedrops over the years, and I&#x27;ve always felt that I might as well just build an eyewash station and pour water on my eyes. My eyes stayed red, I never felt any relief. One day I got a free sample of Rohto V, and I&#x27;ve never looked back. If you need powerful redness relief, you need Rohto.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a contact lens wearer for 20+ years and have constantly struggled with dry and reddish eyes...ugh.  This is the first product I&#x27;ve come across that truly refreshes my eyes and gets rid of 90% - 100% of all the red in my eyes within less than four minutes and they STAY that way for a good 12 to 15 to hours.  I enthusiastically recommend this product and it&#x27;s more than worth the five dollars and forty-nine cents I paid for it...love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried Visine and other over-the-counter eye lubricants/redness-reliever products and none have come close to the results of Rohto-V.</li>
    <li> For all those people out there that need lubricant for their eyes then go with ROHTO, Bc it the only way to go! #1 thanks.</li>
    <li> This little bottle of goodness works amazing ! Ever wake up with really tired/red eyes? Well this is your one &amp; only solution. Use 1-2 drops per eye &amp; it really has a cooling affect to it, and it takes away all reddness &amp; brightens the white of your eye, really makes your eyes brighter. Overall I highly recommend it. I wouldn&#x27;t use it EVERYDAY because this product works by constricting the blood vessels in the eye so I do not know the long term effects of everyday use. A++</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time in front of the computer so my eyes always end up looking tired and red. Based on the positive reviews for this product, I decided to order one to try. Firstly, I like that the menthol is not too strong so it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, and it is refreshing to the eyes. I do notice that it improves the redness but I&#x27;m disappointed that it does not really take the red out completely. Unless there&#x27;s no such thing as completely removing the redness, but I wish that this could do a bit more. Also, some reviews mentioned that your eyes could get used to this and may become worse in terms of redness when you stop using the product, thus you find the need to use it more often. I am afraid that I could be experiencing that right now so thinking to just visit a proper eye doctor and get prescription eye drops.</li>
    <li> These eye drops are made in Japan and I have used for years.  They make your eyes feel fantastic! Very refreshing!</li>
    <li> feel the burn and the tingly sensation as rohtos clears your eyes of irritations and red eyes. it feels like someone took your eyes, and gave it a nice clean cold water bath. feels great, i use it also while i study sometimes when my eyes get tired or i feel sleepy. definitely would recommend</li>
    <li> These drops works so much better than other eye drops, while it feels like dropping acid in your eyes the first time you use them, you&#x27;ll get use to it. It&#x27;s helpful for people trying to wake themselves up, clear up bloodshot eyes from those nights you just need to forget and irritation.</li>
    <li> I had lasik surgery five years ago, and my eyes are always dry and red.  These eye drops worked better then any I have bought over the counter.  They feel good going in, and do releive alot of redness.  Not perfect, but they do help.</li>
    <li> These drops are not for everyone.  I put it in a friends eye and he thought I was trying to kill him.  haha  I actually enjoy the sudden burst of freshness in my eyes and it wakes me right up.</li>
    <li> Not only did these drops not work for me, about 6 months after I bought them I did a little research on eye redness. Turns out alcohol (the main ingredient in these drops) actually disintegrates the top layer of your eye, exposing your cornea and setting you up for possible corneal damage. This is apparently a well known medical fact, and doctors have been using it for years. O_O &lt;-- my actual face after seeing a video of an eye doctor doing surgery and he used alcohol drops to wipe away the top part of somebody&#x27;s eyeball first! That&#x27;s probably why they say not to use Rohto drops with contacts; because it will literally melt through the plastic/silicone! So yeah... even if this did get rid of my redness (which it did NOT), I still wouldn&#x27;t use it, at least not more than twice a year. Do your research first, folks. Eyes are too precious to play around with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years for my dry and red eyes. I used to use visine redness reliever, but my friend introduced me to these eye drops and I haven&#x27;t turned back. Not only does it get the red out of your eyes, it also gets rid of droopiness. Needless to say, it&#x27;s always in that tiny pocket on the right side of my jeans (I think that was designed for coins). It&#x27;s pretty expensive at the grocery store, but on amazon it&#x27;s priced well as long as you get 4 or more of them in one order. A warning for those of you who have never used it before: the first few times you use it is really stings. Not sure if its the menthol factor that does that, but it does feel good after the sting. After using it for a while you won&#x27;t feel that anymore.</li>
    <li> These eye drops are nothing short of intense! After using, there&#x27;s a period of time where I can&#x27;t see, but once vision clears, I usually feel much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They clear out my sinuses too!!</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Do you have any visine?\\&quot; Is the question I asked my room mate. He handed me a little bottle of Rohto. I&#x27;ve never tried this before. He said it would sting a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drop them in and my eyes feel lighting they&#x27;re melting underneath acid. Is this supposed to happen? I keel over and wimper in a corner for a minute or two with my hands pressed against my face. I look into the mirror and my eyes are twice as red as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I curse at nothing for another half a minute and the feeling begins to subside. The redness was gone and my eyes did in fact feel clear and alert. But that&#x27;s kind of like being punched in the face. Anything would feel good after that.</li>
    <li> Great eye drops, original found green bottle at Walmart, but can no longer find.  Glad I found on the internet.</li>
    <li> I can never use plain eye drops again!!  On a hot or windy day, these really are the best and just make your eyes feel so refreshed!</li>
    <li> Five stars for  Rohto Cool Eye Drops, Lubricant, Redness Relief - MENTHOLATUM INC .  Great eye relief and also use the anti itching one for allergies so you don&#x27;t have to take mind boggling antihistamines!</li>
    <li> Product came timely. Got all three.  Makes eyes white.  Cooling feeling is interesting.  I use it daily.  I&#x27;m not a contact wearer.</li>
