      <li>Good price for the contents though.</li>
      <li>it all works great but the coil looked burnt when i got it but after cleaning it it all worked fantastic awsome for beginer artist it could use a book of how to set up</li>

      <li>I guess am going to try and find some better ink maybe</li>
      <li>it is okay for a starter kit.</li>
      <li>I love this item</li>
      <li>It is a good starter kit, but over heats with bigger tattoos, power box shorted out but they mailed me a nee one with no problems, very nice people, i would recomend this kit</li>
      <li>A warning to first time tattooer&#x27;s this machine comes with no directions of any kind so you will need to figure out how to set it up on your own.</li>
      <li>everythinv else is fine as well</li>
      <li>it is smooth</li>
      <li>Also please for my own sake don&#x27;t use the tattoo ink that comes with the machine on yourself it is perfect for praticeing (on fake skin or fruit)</li>
      <li>so far I highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos .</li>
      <li>I really like my gun.</li>
      <li>The reason I gave three is if u r going to buy this spit the extra money out to but a diff foot switch mine does not work its not a bad kit for price but foot switch</li>
      <li>This kit is good but they sent me orange ink instead of black kinda hard to tattoo with just orange ink</li>

    <li> The machine came within 4 days of me buying it. But the foot petal is very small and over heats very easyily. A warning to first time tattooer&#x27;s this machine comes with no directions of any kind so you will need to figure out how to set it up on your own. Also please for my own sake don&#x27;t use the tattoo ink that comes with the machine on yourself it is perfect for praticeing (on fake skin or fruit) but i&#x27;ve never heard of the brand and something tells me it&#x27;s bad ink. Other wise it&#x27;s a perfect machine for beginners.</li>
    <li> Its doing good so far I highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos . I love this item</li>
    <li> Does what is intended.</li>
    <li> When i got this it had a few problems. Including screws being stripped and i was not able to use it.</li>
    <li> excellent just got it and is nice five star well packaged also</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to function out of the box. Good price for the contents though.</li>
