### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>, it&#x27;s the best price I&#x27;ve found-I&#x27;m ordering another 1.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this mirror.</li>
      <li>I received this mirror as gift and it was the best gift that I received for Christmas.</li>
      <li>EXCELLENT customer service.</li>
      <li>This is a good travel size compact mirror.</li>
      <li>Some good quality glue took care of that.</li>
      <li>I ordered 2, figuring if it was good I would save one for a emergency gift for someone.</li>
      <li>after researching all products like this, i came to the conclusion that if you want a really good one you have to bump up to the 60 dollar price range.  </li>
      <li>again, probably as good as you can do for the $$$.</li>
      <li>It might be a good travel mirror.</li>
      <li>Either way, it does the job for \\&quot;us oldsters\\&quot; to see sometimes more than we want!</li>
      <li>The light work, the magnifying side is great.</li>
      <li>Good thing!-it uses AAA batteries, not those hard-to-find button type, as most lighted mirrors have.</li>
      <li>Girlfriend liked the flashlight feature too.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this company for their excellent customer service.</li>
      <li>Price good &amp; with free Amazon shipping</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great and you can really see up close with the magnified side for plucking and tweezing!</li>
      <li>and the led lights are a bit underpowered, but should be OK for travel.</li>
      <li>This mirror seems much more bulky than I had anticipated.  </li>
      <li>Plus three more words.</li>
      <li>great price  fast delivery</li>
      <li>I have a lighted mirror that my grand mother gave me from 1978 and it kicks ass</li>
      <li>Additionally, the mirror itself is just fine and served the purpose on the trip just as was needed.    </li>
      <li>the light is a joke.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this for travel because it had a light to apply make-up and tweezing.  </li>
      <li>This is a great mirror compact but nothing more due to the light kit being so pitiful.</li>
      <li>Original mirror arrived with a mfg. defect--magnifying mirror</li>
      <li>I whip this out wherever I am and am able to see clearly again.</li>
      <li>The item is all flimsy plastic and didnt even light up when I inserted new batteries.</li>
      <li>I thought it was pretty tacky to have to give someone something as a gift that you had already opened.     </li>
      <li>The light helps in dim rooms.</li>
      <li>Both had glue or some other kind of residue all over them, including on the mirrors, so I cleaned them up.     </li>
      <li>this is an ok mirror, handy and does what it says but is somewhat poorly built.  </li>
      <li>I pretty much take this everywhere.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes and always seem to have something in them.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t clearly stated in the description.</li>
      <li>no need to return old mirror, etc.    </li>
      <li>I bought this for my wife for xmas and it was a complete bust.  </li>
      <li>You could buy a compact mirror without a light for less money in a smaller size.</li>
      <li>The second light will not stay lit, no matter how long I hold the button down.  </li>
      <li>This product arrived with a weak light and a mirror that had already come away from the container.  </li>
      <li>The light is so weak it has no effect.</li>
      <li>I finally decided on this one, still not sure if it was the right thing or not.    </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t stop to consider that with the lighted feature, it would be heavy and not fit easily in my purse.  </li>

    <li> This is a good travel size compact mirror.</li>
    <li> Small but does the job</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for xmas and it was a complete bust.  The item is all flimsy plastic and didnt even light up when I inserted new batteries. I would avoid this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for travel because it had a light to apply make-up and tweezing.  The light is so weak it has no effect. You could buy a compact mirror without a light for less money in a smaller size.</li>
    <li> after researching all products like this, i came to the conclusion that if you want a really good one you have to bump up to the 60 dollar price range.  this is an ok mirror, handy and does what it says but is somewhat poorly built.  the light is a joke.  again, probably as good as you can do for the $$$.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror compact but nothing more due to the light kit being so pitiful. I have a lighted mirror that my grand mother gave me from 1978 and it kicks ass (sadly enough the battery for it is no longer manufactured) I bought this mirror in hopes that it would work the same but I was mistaken.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT customer service. Original mirror arrived with a mfg. defect--magnifying mirror double sticky failed and mirror chipped.    I wrote the company of the problem and told them I was planning to take the mirror on a trip.    They shipped one the very next day and it arrived 2 days later--no hassle, no need to return old mirror, etc.    Additionally, the mirror itself is just fine and served the purpose on the trip just as was needed.    I highly recommend this company for their excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> This product arrived with a weak light and a mirror that had already come away from the container.  After inserting batteries, one of the lights died completely and the other was so weak as to be unusable.  The mirrors themselves are poor and the construction felt and was cheap.  This item received almost no use before being discarded.</li>
    <li> great price  fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have had 1 for about 3 years now. The description shows \\&quot;10X\\&quot; in 1 place &amp; \\&quot;7X\\&quot; in another. Either way, it does the job for \\&quot;us oldsters\\&quot; to see sometimes more than we want! Good thing!-it uses AAA batteries, not those hard-to-find button type, as most lighted mirrors have. Bad thing!-I wish the magnifying mirror was the 1 illuminated- it&#x27;s the regular that is lit or I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. Price good &amp; with free Amazon shipping, it&#x27;s the best price I&#x27;ve found-I&#x27;m ordering another 1.</li>
    <li> I received this mirror as gift and it was the best gift that I received for Christmas. I have very sensitive eyes and always seem to have something in them. I whip this out wherever I am and am able to see clearly again. The light work, the magnifying side is great. I am very happy with this mirror.</li>
    <li> The only part that is lighted is the 1X side - not the 10X side.  Wasn&#x27;t clearly stated in the description.</li>
    <li> I have no use for this item. It is not illuminated on the magnification side and is therefore useless for tweezing your eyebrows...which is the purpose I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> I pretty much take this everywhere. It&#x27;s great and you can really see up close with the magnified side for plucking and tweezing! The light helps in dim rooms.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend noticed a girl using one of these when we were out to eat one night. As a surprise, I decided to buy one for her. I never knew how hard it would be to track one of these things down. I finally decided on this one, still not sure if it was the right thing or not.    I ordered 2, figuring if it was good I would save one for a emergency gift for someone. They both arrived in aged packaging, like something 10 or 15 years old, and the mirrors on the doors (magnifying ones,not the ones on the base) had both fallen off. I couldn&#x27;t give them away like that, so I had to take them out of the packaging and glue the mirrors back on. Some good quality glue took care of that. Both had glue or some other kind of residue all over them, including on the mirrors, so I cleaned them up.     Bottom line, I had to repair them before I could give them away. This meant opening the packaging. I thought it was pretty tacky to have to give someone something as a gift that you had already opened.     Poor manufacturing/assembly, cool product. Girlfriend liked the flashlight feature too.</li>
    <li> The second light will not stay lit, no matter how long I hold the button down.  Then it fell apart the 3rd time I used it.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected and the led lights are a bit underpowered, but should be OK for travel. Plus three more words.</li>
    <li> I guess I am use to having a larger area to view.  Not made well.  Would have it as a spare in a desk or junk drawer when in a pinch.  Wouldn&#x27;t carry it in your purse.</li>
    <li> This mirror seems much more bulky than I had anticipated.  I didn&#x27;t stop to consider that with the lighted feature, it would be heavy and not fit easily in my purse.  It might be a good travel mirror.</li>
