### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It perfectly working.</li>
      <li>The serum itself is very pleasant.</li>
      <li>In addition, it dries nicely and one bottle lasts for months!</li>
      <li>Customer service is good, so don&#x27;t worry.</li>
      <li>This is one of the good ones.</li>
      <li>I can say the purple color has been greatly reduced and the puffiness is much better.</li>
      <li>Excellent purchase ,fast delivery.</li>
      <li>I got this eye serum in a timely manner,although i was kind of concerned about the watery consistency of the \\&quot;serum\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>I have tried several under eye creams etc and this one works the best for under eye puffiness.</li>
      <li>but it has done a better job than anything else to address the issue.</li>
      <li>the serum is more watery than what I&#x27;m used to with a serum</li>
      <li>I love using it.</li>
      <li>Always love this stuff ...</li>
      <li>Okay I waited for a month.</li>
      <li>so I can say that it works &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I am assuming that if your problem is more of a skin pigmented issue, this may not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However once you get the feel of it, it works much better than a jar or bottle would.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>so I am pleased with it.</li>
      <li>This product works okay</li>
      <li>Since alot isn&#x27;t needed it would be better if there was more control over the despensing.  </li>
      <li>I could not believe how much more refreshed and well rested</li>
      <li>I am a skeptic for many beauty product claims.  </li>
      <li>It does not flake or come off, as it is more than just a surface</li>
      <li>OK-</li>
      <li>am definitely happy now that I have gone through 2 bottles of this produce and have seen CONSIDERABLE difference in the puffy eyes.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, what I did get was a noticeable tightening effect, so that my concealer now goes on much more smoothly.  </li>
      <li>nothing is perfect: I am a 66 year-old woman with dark circles and \\&quot;bags\\&quot; under eyes for many years.  </li>
      <li>It makes me feel refreshed and easy to use while in the shower.</li>
      <li>It goes on like a serum/liquid which is fine.</li>
      <li>then if I want to put a cream or gel for fine lines or whatever, I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have noticed about a 50% reduction in puffiness, and it also takes care of fine lines.</li>
      <li>but I think it makes your skin smooth and feel well.</li>
      <li>The product came fast and was nicely wrapped.</li>
      <li>Was pleasantly surprised at the good customer service.</li>
      <li>I have seen a significant difference</li>
      <li>The ingredients are good and many are listed in other products but not in this combination.  </li>
      <li>The push top bottle has a tendency to despense too much.</li>
      <li>serum is almost as light as water - after it settles in and your skin has absorbed it you can layer another product over if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The packaging and shipping were well done and have had NO problems whatsoever with getting the order quickly and well wrapped.  </li>
      <li>prefer to layer my own products due to skin sensitivity and because simply stated they are more effective that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, my eyes almost instantly looked better!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fairly young-looking 52-year-old who originally purchased this serum hoping it would diminish my long-term dark circles and undereye puffiness.  </li>
      <li>I have tried MANY products and spent much more and haven&#x27;t gotten the results that I have with this product.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>the results are well worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products, from Garnier to Lancome, and none will completely deflate my puffy eyes.</li>
      <li>using another of the Excel products for the face and am pleased with it as well so far.  </li>
      <li>As the other reviews say the more you use it the better the results.  </li>
      <li>This goes into the skin right away and soaks in so it can do</li>
      <li>I have tried many products but nothing thus far has really worked until I bought this a couple of weeks ago.</li>
      <li>Still on the first bottle.  </li>
      <li>And the product does make your eyes look better (younger, fresher).</li>
      <li>I can actually hide them much better now with makeup.</li>
      <li>On days that I don&#x27;t go anywhere, I try to remember to use in several more times during the day.</li>
      <li>Obviously, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>This serum aborb pretty fast after applying</li>
      <li>I chose this serum because it had all of the ingredients in it that had been proven to help with the kind of dark circles that I have.</li>
      <li>Plus side a little goes a long way and has a pleasant light fragrance.</li>
      <li>If I have as much improvement in the next 6 months as I&#x27;ve had in the previous 6 months, I&#x27;ll be very pleased!  </li>
      <li>(Lancome works wonderfully too, but this is less than half the price!)</li>
      <li>Yes this stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very silky.</li>
      <li>The product works very well  </li>
      <li>not see any improvement i really thought from the advertisement it would help</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s fine, as long as it&#x27;s working!</li>
      <li>You need very little, it goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and then I can put on my moisturizer and/or makeup.</li>
      <li>This seem&#x27;s a bit runny, so you wind up using more, so it won&#x27;t last as long.</li>
      <li>I first started using an equate brand roll-on that contains Haloxy that I picked up at the local store.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have super sensitive or dry skin.</li>
      <li>This was done in combination of more water, less tv/comp, and same amt of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Last time it seemed to work a bit more noticable but my puffiness is definitely less when I use this both morning and evening.  </li>
      <li>I even went as far to spend the money on the Genucel product with no luck.  </li>
      <li>But then I wasn&#x27;t even hoping for the circle to have completely diminished.</li>
      <li>I have natural &amp;#34;Raccoon Eye&#x27;s and have tried simillar products.</li>
      <li>so far after one week i do.</li>
      <li>That would be the kind that have tiny particles of blood and fluid trapped in the cells and capillaries under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend it but not sure if using the same product somehow isn&#x27;t as effective without changing to something different and then going back to it since I haven&#x27;t had as much success</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is one of the few products that I can actually use around my eyes without them becoming irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You also need to be careful when dispensing as the pump is a bit tricky and you get more than necessary if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
      <li>I have tried several other eye products without much success.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product long enough now to know that I really like it and will definitley order it again.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any clear results from this problem outside of the irritation it caused underneath my eye.</li>
      <li>I have a very mild dark circles under my eyes, After applying this product twice a day for 4 weeks there was no visible improvement in the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and I wake up without having those really dark circles which I&#x27;ve had my whole life (hereditary).</li>
      <li>It works to make my dark circles much lighter and I no longer look like a raccoon.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for almost a year now, and it really does tighten up tissue under eyes, and lightens the dark circles.</li>
      <li>I still have dark circles and I was really hoping this was the&lt;br /&gt;remedy.  </li>

<li> Finally one of my co-workers (who is also a new mom) took pity on me and dragged me into the bathroom for a little mini-make over.</li>
<li> I was so amazed that it helped the puffiness in such a short time that it gave me a little hope, so I started doing research on products that might actually make a noticeable difference.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t tried it for a long time</li>
<li> Its effect, however, is yet to be determined, since I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long period of time.</li>
<li> This product is not a complete 100% fix</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve had moon circles under my eyes since I was a teen that have slowly become purplish tone and puffy now that I am 50 yrs old.</li>
<li> This is my second purchase of Excel Dark Circles Under eye serum.</li>
<li> This is my third bottle of Excel Dark Circle Under-eye Serum.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent purchase ,fast delivery.It perfectly working.I recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it contains proven ingredients for reducing puffiness and circles - Haloxyl, Regu-Age  and Eyeliss - WITHOUT a heavy cream base or irritating gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And without caffeine either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the few products that I can actually use around my eyes without them becoming irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then if I want to put a cream or gel for fine lines or whatever, I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they mix these ingredients in a heavier cream then their efficacy is reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is almost as light as water - after it settles in and your skin has absorbed it you can layer another product over if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to layer my own products due to skin sensitivity and because simply stated they are more effective that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a winner .</li>
    <li> I got this eye serum in a timely manner,although i was kind of concerned about the watery consistency of the \\&quot;serum\\&quot;. I use it in the AM and PM, and it gets rid of puffiness in like 30 seconds. Aside from the watery consistency that i don&#x27;t like, it does work.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 1.0 oz size, but was sent the o.5 size, so I contacted the seller and they sent me the 1.0 oz size at no cost to me. I received it in two days. Was pleasantly surprised at the good customer service. I have used this product long enough now to know that I really like it and will definitley order it again. It&#x27;s one of the few products I have used that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> Second time ordering this product.  Last time it seemed to work a bit more noticable but my puffiness is definitely less when I use this both morning and evening.  The ingredients are good and many are listed in other products but not in this combination.  Would definitely recommend it but not sure if using the same product somehow isn&#x27;t as effective without changing to something different and then going back to it since I haven&#x27;t had as much success this time.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use and determine when the container is empty.  You also need to be careful when dispensing as the pump is a bit tricky and you get more than necessary if you aren&#x27;t careful.  However once you get the feel of it, it works much better than a jar or bottle would.&lt;br /&gt;You get a cleaner product with the pump.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely happy now that I have gone through 2 bottles of this produce and have seen CONSIDERABLE difference in the puffy eyes.  Also switched to another product that I ordered and now am back to using Excel.  I have tried MANY products and spent much more and haven&#x27;t gotten the results that I have with this product.  Hardily endorse it and will continue to order.&lt;br /&gt;Also using another of the Excel products for the face and am pleased with it as well so far.  The packaging and shipping were well done and have had NO problems whatsoever with getting the order quickly and well wrapped.  If you have baggy eyes, it works!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of Excel Dark Circles Under eye serum. I used it twice a day (AM &amp; PM) and saw a noticeable difference in about a week. I wish the consistency of the product was a bit thicker and creamy (it is a liquid) but the results speak for themselves!</li>
    <li> I am a male, over 50, with dark circles under my eyes. I have been using this product for almost a year now, and it really does tighten up tissue under eyes, and lightens the dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have natural &amp;#34;Raccoon Eye&#x27;s and have tried simillar products. This seem&#x27;s a bit runny, so you wind up using more, so it won&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> OK- nothing is perfect: I am a 66 year-old woman with dark circles and \\&quot;bags\\&quot; under eyes for many years.  This product has improved my under-eye appearance in a few weeks of use.  You need very little, it goes on smoothly, dries quickly, and then I can put on my moisturizer and/or makeup. It does not flake or come off, as it is more than just a surface treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning and before bed-time.  DO NOT expect \\&quot;plastic surgery\\&quot; type results - but I saw an improvement.  I am a skeptic for many beauty product claims.  However, I ordered a second bottle of Excel and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The product came fast and was nicely wrapped. Its effect, however, is yet to be determined, since I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long period of time. Having said that, from a month of use, I can see some slight changes in my dark circles, which look a little bit better. I will carry on using it and see what is going to happen.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing, was very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products, from Garnier to Lancome, and none will completely deflate my puffy eyes. However, this is the closest it will get for me. Some of it&#x27;s genetic, but what isn&#x27;t, Excel&#x27;s Under Eye Serum takes care of for me. I have noticed about a 50% reduction in puffiness, and it also takes care of fine lines. (Lancome works wonderfully too, but this is less than half the price!) In addition, it dries nicely and one bottle lasts for months! Obviously, I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I used it for a month and did not see any improvement on my dark circle under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see result, use clinic brand</li>
    <li> Works well as a moisturizer. Slightly lightened darkness. Plus side a little goes a long way and has a pleasant light fragrance. Dries sticky though. I perfer my EyeXcellece from PCA.</li>
    <li> This product does help with the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  I will be  buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Normally if they say it&#x27;s a serum, it&#x27;s a thin lotion, not a serum.  A serum should be a liquid without an oil base so it can absorb into the skin .  This goes into the skin right away and soaks in so it can do it&#x27;s job.  Then add your moisturizer.    It does what it says it does!  Try it.    My only recommendation to the manufacturer is to put this into a eyedropper bottle.  Since alot isn&#x27;t needed it would be better if there was more control over the despensing.  The push top bottle has a tendency to despense too much.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other eye products without much success.  I even went as far to spend the money on the Genucel product with no luck.  This product is not a complete 100% fix but it has improved the puffiness under my eyes a lot.  I would say they reduce the puffiness probably 70 to 75%.  As the other reviews say the more you use it the better the results.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used it twice daily as directed for the past three weeks. There is absolutely no change in appearance of puffiness or dark circles. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product works okay</li>
    <li> I have trouble with eye products causing irritation and this one has not done that so I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any clear results from this problem outside of the irritation it caused underneath my eye. It tends to dry out the skin, especially if you use any facial scrubs. If you&#x27;re trying to buy the one-fix treatment, this is definitely not it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fairly young-looking 52-year-old who originally purchased this serum hoping it would diminish my long-term dark circles and undereye puffiness.  I used the product morning and night faithfully for at least a month, but I really didn&#x27;t see any change in my dark circles or puffiness.  HOWEVER, what I did get was a noticeable tightening effect, so that my concealer now goes on much more smoothly.  Anyone over the age of 50 who uses undereye concealer will appreciate the value of this!  I&#x27;m still dissapointed that the serum didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on my dark circles or puffiness, but the smoothing effect is enough to motivate me to keep using the product and give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> so far after one week i do. not see any improvement i really thought from the advertisement it would help</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a while now.  Still on the first bottle.  I still have dark circles and I was really hoping this was the&lt;br /&gt;remedy.  It&#x27;s not but it may be making them a little lighter.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months, I use it before bed and sometimes in the morning. I have seen a significant difference so I can say that it works &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Okay I waited for a month. This has done NOTHING for my under eye circles and bags. It goes on like a serum/liquid which is fine. But it simply didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Always love this stuff ... yes, I know it isn&#x27;t as thick as some would like but it does the job for me so I will reorder.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price. Works on an Asian that had thinning skin near eyes that results in dark eye circles. Used this for less then a week everyday pm/am and i can see my under eye skin flattened out to rest of face and the dark eye circle disappearing. This was done in combination of more water, less tv/comp, and same amt of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did cuase a minor irritation to skin but its not that bad bc the results are well worth it.</li>
    <li> This did not do anything at all for me but at least it wasn&#x27;t very expensive compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I had a nasty allergic reaction to this stuff. I got itchy, blotchy, dry red marks under my eyes. Went down to using it just once a day and still had the same problem. Even tried mixing it with my facial moisturizer to alleviate the dryness. So grumpy I spent $30 on a tube of this stuff so I could toss it. Never even got to see if it made a difference to my dark under-eyes. I don&#x27;t have super sensitive or dry skin. Wish I knew what ingredient caused the problem so I could look for other products.</li>
    <li> I have a very mild dark circles under my eyes, After applying this product twice a day for 4 weeks there was no visible improvement in the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. Iam still searching for an under eye cream/serum that will get rid of my dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have spent time and money looking for a product that would work to lighten my extremely dark circles. A dermatologist office suggested a product costing $100.00 and it did nothing.  This is my third bottle of Excel Dark Circle Under-eye Serum. It works to make my dark circles much lighter and I no longer look like a raccoon. I would have rated it 5 stars if the serum was thicker.</li>
    <li> Yes this stuff really works.  Mark circles are gone and puffiness disappears.  This is one of the good ones.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products but nothing thus far has really worked until I bought this a couple of weeks ago. I use morning and night and I wake up without having those really dark circles which I&#x27;ve had my whole life (hereditary). I also notice throughout the day around and under my eye area is lighter and the dark circles are not deep like they&#x27;ve always been. the serum is more watery than what I&#x27;m used to with a serum but that&#x27;s fine, as long as it&#x27;s working! I will def. be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple of years. Seems to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a million things to help with my dark eye circles. This product is not the \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for my problem but it has done a better job than anything else to address the issue. The under-eye darkness has decreased to a certain degree and I&#x27;m hoping with continued use, I will see continued improvement. The serum itself is very pleasant. It didn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all. It&#x27;s very silky. The bottle has lasted months (and I use a lot everyday). And the product does make your eyes look better (younger, fresher). I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for 6 months. I am med/light Caucasian and I&#x27;ve had moon circles under my eyes since I was a teen that have slowly become purplish tone and puffy now that I am 50 yrs old. I first started using an equate brand roll-on that contains Haloxy that I picked up at the local store. I was so amazed that it helped the puffiness in such a short time that it gave me a little hope, so I started doing research on products that might actually make a noticeable difference. I chose this serum because it had all of the ingredients in it that had been proven to help with the kind of dark circles that I have. That would be the kind that have tiny particles of blood and fluid trapped in the cells and capillaries under my eyes. I am assuming that if your problem is more of a skin pigmented issue, this may not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this, without makeup on, I looked like I had small bruising under my eyes. I wish I could say that the circles have disappeared, but they have not. But then I wasn&#x27;t even hoping for the circle to have completely diminished. I can say the purple color has been greatly reduced and the puffiness is much better. I can actually hide them much better now with makeup. I plan to continue using this product, after all, my circles didn&#x27;t appear in just a few weeks or even months. I am hoping that over time it will continue to improve. If I have as much improvement in the next 6 months as I&#x27;ve had in the previous 6 months, I&#x27;ll be very pleased!  I&#x27;m not considering plastic surgery or cosmetic type of injections, so time and patience is all I&#x27;ve got. I use this morning and night. On days that I don&#x27;t go anywhere, I try to remember to use in several more times during the day. It only take a drop on a finger tip.</li>
    <li> This serum aborb pretty fast after applying and you don&#x27;t feel oily at all. I haven&#x27;t tried it for a long time but I think it makes your skin smooth and feel well. The circle takes time to dissappear I think. Customer service is good, so don&#x27;t worry. They have registered delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the product works. It seems like water to me. I don&#x27;t see any change.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using an undereye cream that I got at the mall for a while now. I’m a new mom, so I tend to have a lot of sleepless nights, which means I have a lot of dark circles. Finally one of my co-workers (who is also a new mom) took pity on me and dragged me into the bathroom for a little mini-make over. She told me she was sick of hearing from everyone how tired and run down I looked. She applied some of this to me, and told me where to get it, and I kid you not ladies, my eyes almost instantly looked better! I could not believe how much more refreshed and well rested I looked. You’ve got to try it!</li>
    <li> The product works very well  I love using it. It makes me feel refreshed and easy to use while in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have tried several under eye creams etc and this one works the best for under eye puffiness.</li>
