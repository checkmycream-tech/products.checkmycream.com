<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My new favorites. I don&#x27;t wear lashes often bur bought these for a special occasion because everyone raves about them, and now I see why... They feel great on, very light and look perfect on the eyes. I wore them all day, forgot I even had them on, until I looked at myself in the mirror to get ready for bed, they are that comfortable.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a lash maniac like me, you&#x27;re probably familiar with brands like Kiss, Ardell, or Andrea lashes. These are the exact same with the exception of them being a tad longer, which is actually kinda nice since you can cut them to size anyways! Seller was as prompt as prompt can get, excellent transaction!</li>
    <li> Horrible!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;I know how to apply lashes and these are just horrible&lt;br /&gt;Sharp edges that dig on eye lid&lt;br /&gt;But Kiss brand instead! They rock!!</li>
    <li> redcherry lashes are my favorite</li>
    <li> My all time favorite lashes! I get lots of good uses out of one pair!</li>
    <li> Looks very natural but it&#x27;s too long for my eyes. Overall I love it.</li>
    <li> These are great quality as are all of Red Cherrys. They are, however, EXTREMELY long. They have to be trimmed to make them wearable. They&#x27;re less full/dense than I thought but they are still fun to switch it up. EVERY single time I order from these guys they ship INSANELY fast and it&#x27;s packaged pristinely. Happy yet again and will absolutely order from them every single time!</li>
    <li> They look so nice in the pack. But do not look very well on the eyes. I was looking for a natural effect, in order to obtain that i had to cut lashes a bit on the sides close to inner corner of the eyes.</li>
    <li> The best eyelashes ever</li>
    <li> Feathery, dramatic yet natural, gorgeous pair of lashes. Good quality, you can barely see the band and it feels so lightweight. You get a good five wears out of one, just as long as you take great care in removing and cleaning them.</li>
    <li> I love Red Cherry lashes and this is a great value.  The WSPs are dramatic yet still have a natural look!</li>
    <li> These lashes are so pretty! They&#x27;re great for day and night. They can be used multiple times. Will repurchase again after I go through the ones I bought!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these lashes. They are long, yes, but because they&#x27;re wispies it doesn&#x27;t look completely unnatural. I used black eyelash glue, and most people really couldn&#x27;t tell that I had them on. They just said my eyes looked nice :)</li>
    <li> I love these lashes very natural looking,long lasting,and cheap.Shipping was very fast i had no problems at all,will buy again</li>
    <li> These are just simply beautiful! The best you can find for the price.  I got so many compliments while wearing them.  People thought I just had naturally long lashes.  They shipped fast and I found I could reuse them multiple times were I careful removing them.  Would definitely buy these again!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Always my go to lashes on myself and my clients.</li>
    <li> My favorite Red Cherry lashes. These looks so natural. They are staggered lengths just like natural lashes are. All Red Cherry brand lashes are wonderful and I have never had to trim any of them at the sides.</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite everyday do to lashes!!! Obsessed!!! They look natural and you don&#x27;t feel then even if they&#x27;re on all day!</li>
    <li> I love these lashes for the price they&#x27;re awesome</li>
    <li> I finally found my lashes . I have been wearing them from Sally&#x27;s and then I just tried these and WHOW!! They look so natural no one can tell at all. I put mascara on these but they are just so natural and I have ordered so many now . I don&#x27;t want to run out . Lol  you must try these!</li>
    <li> loooooveeee it ❤️ it&#x27;s very glamour</li>
    <li> Love them! They look very real and no mascara needed. I do trim them just a tad to fit my eyes. I&#x27;ll continue to order.</li>
    <li> These look unnatural and extremely long but once I applied them, they looked natural! Got so many compliments on these and everyone asked if they were my real lashes.</li>
    <li> These are really good lashes they give a natural look long in length and fit my eye well I see people complain about how they have to cut them down to fit them but they have to make the lashes long to fit bigger eyes also the packing and delivery was great came a day early and they were rapped and pack very nicely</li>
    <li> Theses lashes were good, but quite long and still slightly uncomfortable! I probably would splurge on a nicer pair next time</li>
    <li> I hate the big butterfly lashes but these look so natural. If I want a more dramatic look I just stack them. i invest in a good eyelash adhesive and I get multiple uses from these lashes. I wish they cost a little less but honestly I don&#x27;t mind compared to other lash prices and you get 3 sets. To me these are better then the ardell wispies. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was looking for false lashes that were natural and these Red Cherry Wispies are great. They Are very pretty and look best with Natural makeup. I dont recomend them with dark or dramatic makeup because they dont really stand out, but thats my opinion:) defently will order more :)</li>
    <li> I like it a lot.  I needed fake lashes here and there and these were WOWZAAA.. Love them for the drama they give. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> easy to apply and look natural</li>
    <li> I absolutely love them. I&#x27;m going to reorder tons of them because they are a absolute must have!!!! Best lashes ever. They look like eyelash extensions, they are perfect!</li>
    <li> I am so in love with these lashes, I would always wear Ardell&#x27;s demi whispies and i really loved those but these are so much more natural and comfortable and less expensive. I really recommend them, especially this style if you love fake lashes. I&#x27;m regretting not ordering more but i will definitely be repurchasing these again. Also i received my lashes 3 days after purchase. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great quality, but for some reason they just look very unnatural on me, they different little wispies going in different directions looked odd on my eyes, I did use they for a fairy look and they were great, just not something to wear when you don&#x27;t want people to know your wearing false lashes.</li>
    <li> best eyelashes used ever</li>
    <li> These are sooo perfect they give a natural look and kind of a dramatic look at the same time perfect for everyday wear I will be purchasing more from this seller!!!!</li>
    <li> The best cheap lashes ever!!!</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying red cherry lashes and all I can say now is that they are my go to brand</li>
    <li> I had to cut them down, too long for me, but nice looking on. I would recommend them to all</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these!! I always get compliments on them and love how they look natural. I love the product and have fast they get to me after i order them. I just cant get enough of these!! Would definitely recommend and have to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Red cherry lashes are really great for the price. It doesn&#x27;t have a thick band like some other lashes which makes it look damn near natural. I love these lashes. A perfect everyday natural wear. Dozens of compliments every wear. I always get people mistaken them for my real lashes</li>
    <li> Natural looking lashes.</li>
    <li> A lot longer and fuller than I expected.  I thought they would look more natural with the varying lengths in the picture,  but they are more dramatic than I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> Great item, super fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have purchased lashes before from Amazon.com, and have to say this are one of my favorite, though they are a bit long, I cut them down a bit, they look natural and extremely sexy...</li>
    <li> These are beautiful long lashes that are super light weight. Would definitely recommend :)</li>
    <li> I wish they were more full.  They were super long but very dense.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re pretty but not my style I thought they were gona look different.  I like dramatic looks n these r more on the natural look. Good lashes though</li>
    <li> I love these lashes so much! They are so light weight and look stunning ☺️ got so many compliments on them</li>
    <li> I love these lashes for a natural but LONG look. It&#x27;s enough to be noticeable and dramatic without looking overdone. Every time I&#x27;ve worn them I received a ton of compliment.s</li>
    <li> These false lashes from Red Cherry are dramatic without being heavy. They are quite long and wispy, and you can go with or without an additional coat of mascara on your own lashes (assuming that your lashes are naturally dark).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear them for photo shoots and special occasions. It makes all the difference!</li>
    <li> This is my first set of falsies, and I wore them for a birthday party. They are absolutely stunning on the eyes and look really natural. The band is thin and invisible, so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about other people noticing. The quality is superb, especially for the price. I was planning on buying Velour eyelashes, but I am now thinking why bother. These are cheap enough that I can dump them after one use. I also don&#x27;t plan on wearing falsies other than for glamorous going out occasions. Spectacular!</li>
    <li> These are by far my most favorite natural looking lashes.  The give a great daytime look that really open your eyes.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t pick these for a night time look. I&#x27;ve had many compliments with these and have fooled manay people thinking they were real.  And what I really love is that the band is thin so it gives it even more of a realistic look.  I&#x27;m not a fan of lashes with thick bands.</li>
    <li> The layers of the lashes are great. Love that they&#x27;re different. The band itself is a tiny tiny bit noticeable but manageable. I get compliments wear it. And it doesn&#x27;t look tacky, the way some false lashes appear.</li>
    <li> Love the length and natural look. Easier to apply if you cut them into four pieces. Use them over and over by merely removing glue each night when you take them off.</li>
    <li> best eyelashes!! I wore these in Vegas for a night out and I can wear them for a day to day look!</li>
    <li> I got the 3 pack of these aand they look amazing!  I had to trim them fit my eyelids but they worked great!  They are a little long for daily wear according to my taste, but looked amazing for evening out!  Very light and realisitc looking!</li>
    <li> I love the these lashes. I don&#x27;t usually wear false lashes, but these don&#x27;t look fake. They truly give you that wispy look. If that is what you&#x27;re looking for, then order these.</li>
    <li> Nice lashes. A bit too long for my taste, thought they would be more natural looking since they are wispies.</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more of these. Not a drastic look.  I love them</li>
    <li> Little longer than expected but very natural looking</li>
    <li> Pretty Wispy and dramatic.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great lashes, gives you a natural look. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Very nice lashes, but way too long.</li>
    <li> these are pretty lashes. I liked them. They didn&#x27;t look how I thought they would look, but they are pretty.</li>
    <li> beautiful lashes. So lightweight</li>
    <li> a bit longer than I expected, but still beautiful</li>
    <li> I LOVE these lashes. They are what they&#x27;re called whispy! I have long lashes and these are a bit long for me. No worries tho i just trimmed them a bit :) quick shipping and great price!</li>
    <li> I totally hate these I have the ardell wispies and those are100 Times better these are not my kind of lashes don&#x27;t recommend for those who like fuller noticeable lashes !!!!!!! Waste of my money</li>
    <li> Love these lashes😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 but that price needs to decrease 😩😩😩</li>
    <li> They look and feel real</li>
