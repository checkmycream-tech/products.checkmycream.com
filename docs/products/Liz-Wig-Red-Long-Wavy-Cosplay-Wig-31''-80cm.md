      <li>Hair comes out easily.</li>
      <li>This wig is FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>Absolutely gorgeous and soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived two days after I ordered it, which was perfect since I was ordering it last minute for a cosplay I&#x27;m doing (if anyone else is looking at it for cosplay, I&#x27;m using it for Poison Ivy if that helps), and the curls are very bouncy and stay in place.</li>
      <li>In fact, the bangs are super easy to style, all I had to do was comb it through with my fingers and it&#x27;ll stay in whatever position I want, whether I wanted it to curl in or out, or be pushed to one side or another</li>
      <li>The shade of red isn&#x27;t too bright.</li>
      <li>Truly in love with this wig, using it for a Poison Ivy Lolita cosplay, it&#x27;s so full and bouncy and the curls have stayed in place so far with me twirling in it</li>
      <li>It looks exactly as pictured!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it on early</li>
      <li>Several people stopped to ask me what kind of products</li>
      <li>ordered this kind of last minute for Halloween and still got it in time.</li>
      <li>Looks and feels close to real hair, got many compliments and a LOT of people asking if it was my real</li>
      <li>Super fast and weekend delivery!</li>
      <li>,the price is right and arrive on time.</li>
      <li>Overall, a nice wig and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>It will be pretty fun to wear for any even that encourages character dress up.</li>
      <li>It is great quality compare to a lot of the eigs I have bought online in the past.</li>
      <li>This is such a beautiful wig, the other reviews of it being darker is true.</li>
      <li>It is soft and easy to comb.</li>
      <li>The synthetic hair is soft yet strong.</li>
      <li>Pretty color.  </li>
      <li>I love wearing it whenever there&#x27;s an accessory with everything and people compliment it and say I should have it as an actual hair style.</li>
      <li>This is the first of two wigs I have gotten for Cosplay</li>
      <li>I was glad that it didn&#x27;t have any hints of orange and was a legitimate red.</li>
      <li>Not super realistic, but definitely good for costume wear or dress up.</li>
      <li>The color is bright and the wig is thick, totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>Color is a rich red - not fake looking at all.</li>
      <li>The wig is very high quality.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it for a poison ivy costume and it looks just like real hair.</li>
      <li>and it looks like real hair.</li>
      <li>I was reluctant to buy any because I kept thinking back to the really cheap Halloween wigs I wore as a kid, but I was amazed at the quality of these wigs.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much.</li>
      <li>However, do not buy it if you are looking for realistic.</li>
      <li>It looks very natural!</li>
      <li>So full and long.</li>
      <li>The hair is soft and the color is vibrant.</li>
      <li>Complete coverage,</li>
      <li>People actually thought it was my real hair at the Halloween party.</li>
      <li>I am always a bit skeptical ordering wigs, however, this is a lovely wig!</li>
      <li>The wig looks almost exactly like the picture, excluding two minor factors, none of which were unexpected: Firstly, the red is slightly different (not a major change, probably due to lighting).</li>
      <li>The red is a darker more serious red, so not as playful as I wanted.</li>
      <li>Secondly, the bangs are different, but it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed with some styling.</li>
      <li>but now I want to order a few different just for fun.</li>
      <li>Wig was nice and thick, ended up having to trim it up a few inches.  </li>
      <li>I lost a little bit when I first took it out of the package.</li>

    <li> This wig is FANTASTIC. I would pay a lot more money for a wig of this quality. Complete coverage, and it looks like real hair.

    <li> The wig is a great bright red color... like the little mermaid but less orange. The hair is long and curly. I lost a little bit when I first took it out of the package. Not super realistic, but definitely good for costume wear or dress up. Glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> This company came through for me when I was in a wig bind. BEAUTIFUL product, too. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister and she wears it all the time!!!!!! It is great quality compare to a lot of the eigs I have bought online in the past. And the color is GORGEOUS!</li>

    <li> This is a great wig for Cosplay. I am not used to having bangs that long, so I&#x27;ll need to figure that one out, maybe I can clip them. I tried this on and my husband loved it! Even though the bangs were a little silly long. It&#x27;s the look I want, so I&#x27;m not complaining. I&#x27;m glad I tried it on early so I can learn how to see through them. This is the first of two wigs I have gotten for Cosplay and I love it. I was reluctant to buy any because I kept thinking back to the really cheap Halloween wigs I wore as a kid, but I was amazed at the quality of these wigs. The hair is soft and the color is vibrant. It will be pretty fun to wear for any even that encourages character dress up.</li>
