      <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>It came to me to try this product since it is made of all great ingredients and was sulfur free.  </li>
      <li>I am sure this Eufora line is really good, but just not for me.</li>
      <li>Clearly my hair isn&#x27;t in the best condition.</li>
      <li>Eufora was recommended to me since I have very fine hair.</li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo for fine hair; not thin, but very fine.</li>
      <li>Have been using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>I have bought this product from a salon many times.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of it and the way this product preforms on my hair.  </li>
      <li>and I love the results.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is all organic, and safe for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo, I have frizzy hair, really moisturizes and tames the frizz, the smoothing balm is also great really defines my curls</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>to be able to get the knots out of my hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is in better condition now too, and falls out</li>
      <li>Smells lovely.</li>
      <li>I love all of them.</li>
      <li>Works fantastic and has a nice fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Easy on colored hair .  </li>
      <li>I have fine, shoulder-length hair.</li>
      <li>I have all but discontinued ordering shampoo on-line even though the brands I want aren&#x27;t available in my area.</li>
      <li>I now use Eufora Hair Spray and Fixation.&lt;br /&gt;Really good product, wish it was sold more locally.</li>
      <li>Rich lather and silky hair.</li>
      <li>Been using product for many years and really like it.</li>
      <li>Makes your hair shiny and full of body.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Eufora products to anyone who wants better looking/feeling hair. :)</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful, and a little bit will create a decent lather.</li>
      <li>Leaves my very fine hair soft and manageable, while still giving it body.</li>
      <li>This leaves my hair clean, and crisp.</li>
      <li>I had some WEN shampoo that I used right away</li>
      <li>and she said it was exactly what she wanted.</li>
      <li>I like to mix up my shampoos periodically and have enjoyed the smell and lather this provides; my hair tends to be dry</li>
      <li>Shampoo made my hair dry like cotton candy and the conditioner didn&#x27;t make it better.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Very satisified with the product and the provider.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and works very well.  </li>
      <li>9 times out of 10 I get a bottle that has a lot of the contents missing as if someone who is packing this stuff brings their own bottles in and helps themselves to ordered products.</li>
      <li>This must have been an old shampoo on the shelf b/c it didn&#x27;t smell right and did not do its job...  </li>
      <li>I have dry, fine hair and this shampoo keeps it from getting damaged and crunchy feeling.  </li>
      <li>From the first time I used Eufora shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s felt alive and is bouncy when I style it.  </li>
      <li>This bottle was only about 3/4 full.</li>
      <li>It gives your hair a healthy shine and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>Honestly if you&#x27;re like me and wash your hair every other day, this shampoo will last you 5 months.</li>
      <li>Only need less than a pea-size amount of shampoo and lathers up nicely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 52 year old woman with shoulder length, straight hair, so you can imagine that at this point in the game, my hair isn&#x27;t what it used to be, but this shampoo has brought back a wonderful softness and shine that I haven&#x27;t had in a long time.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s quite a bit more than I will usually spend for the amount of product you get.</li>
      <li>It helped my hair get back to original luster, shine,and overall health.  </li>
      <li>I changed shampoos and had half a bottle left that I held on to and am glad I did.</li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has thinned and feels flat.</li>
      <li>I have, in the past, gone from one shampoo to another trying to find something that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals but worked well.  </li>
      <li>It is naturally thick, but now it feels super soft again.</li>
      <li>The product is very nice - not a heavy scent, and provides additional hydration to my hair in these very cold and winter conditions on the East Coast.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the extravagant price.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair, but use a little over a quarter size drop of this, and it really lathers all my hair and feels so clean.</li>

    <li> Makes your hair shiny and full of body.</li>
    <li> I have thrown this shampoo away!  I have medium length hair, and when I&#x27;m done shampooing, my hair is a tangled mess!  Even after using the conditioner, I have to use to shine spray (about 13-15 pumps of it!) to be able to get the knots out of my hair.  I have never had dry ends, but after a month of using this, my ends were all dried up and frizzed. I don&#x27;t recommend this or any other product in this line.</li>
    <li> Eufora Hydrating Shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Unfortunately, the shipper, Michael Steffen, sent the bottles without a box.  While the shipper taped the bottle tops, the bottles were obviously crushed and leaked shampoo.  I&#x27;ll buy the product any time, but not from this shipper.</li>
    <li> Use it every day.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The lady at the salon recommended this shampoo.  I bought it from the salon.  I love the smell of it and the way this product preforms on my hair.  So being able to get it as a reduce price is a win, win for me.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this product online since my salon was out and they didn&#x27;t know when their order was coming in.  Very satisified with the product and the provider.  thanks</li>
    <li> This shampoo and my color treated hair seem to mix. It keeps my &#x27;red&#x27; from fading from one salon vist to the next about 8-9 weeks and my hair doesn&#x27;t look over processed either. I now use Eufora Hair Spray and Fixation.&lt;br /&gt;Really good product, wish it was sold more locally.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about buying this shampoo online but I&#x27;m very happy with the product I got! Totally recommend this seller. The shampoo works perfectly and makes my ends look so much better!</li>
    <li> I have dry, fine hair and this shampoo keeps it from getting damaged and crunchy feeling.  A tiny amount goes a long way, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but this is the best stuff I have ever used.  I have, in the past, gone from one shampoo to another trying to find something that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals but worked well.  It seemed that every &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo I used made my hair feel like straw.  I&#x27;m a 52 year old woman with shoulder length, straight hair, so you can imagine that at this point in the game, my hair isn&#x27;t what it used to be, but this shampoo has brought back a wonderful softness and shine that I haven&#x27;t had in a long time.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it and I can&#x27;t wait to try the conditioner.  And, I&#x27;m so happy that this shampoo was recommended to me.</li>
    <li> I love Eufora products and happy to find on amazon!</li>
    <li> The product smells nothing like what I received at the actual salon. It dries out my hair each time I wash it, and I wash my hair about twice a week. I have to use a handful of the shampoo. I have fine, shoulder-length hair.</li>
    <li> I was talking with a hairdresser who had a great reputation and he said anything Eufora was great.  I bought the shampoo and moisturizer conditioner and tried it out.  I have waist-length curly thick hair.  It was a total disaster.  Shampoo made my hair dry like cotton candy and the conditioner didn&#x27;t make it better.  I ended up using almost half the bottle of the conditioner, and after I did my final rinse, I still couldn&#x27;t get the wide-tooth comb past an inch off my scalp - it was one big cotton-candy tangle-head mess!  I had some WEN shampoo that I used right away and I could then get my comb thru my hair and had minimal tangles.  I am sure this Eufora line is really good, but just not for me.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for many years.</li>
    <li> I like to mix up my shampoos periodically and have enjoyed the smell and lather this provides; my hair tends to be dry but this shampoo feels slightly conditioning. I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great quality, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the extravagant price. It&#x27;s cheaper online than buying retail though.</li>
    <li> Been using product for many years and really like it.</li>
    <li> I have really dry hair from going to the pool 4/5 days a week.  I need a shampoo like this to help make my hair from so frizzy and dry.  My daughter loves it too.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Leaves my very fine hair soft and manageable, while still giving it body. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. It gives your hair a healthy shine and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy. I have been using it awhile now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I could feel the difference in the texture of my hair when I used it. I like it.</li>
    <li> I have all but discontinued ordering shampoo on-line even though the brands I want aren&#x27;t available in my area. 9 times out of 10 I get a bottle that has a lot of the contents missing as if someone who is packing this stuff brings their own bottles in and helps themselves to ordered products. This bottle was only about 3/4 full. The product works great though. Rich lather and silky hair. Smells lovely.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for fine hair; not thin, but very fine. I&#x27;ve used it for years&lt;br /&gt;and recommend it to anyone with my type hair.</li>
    <li> My mom wanted this as a gift and she said it was exactly what she wanted. No issues with this product</li>
    <li> I used this prodct along with the conditioner after a brazillian straightning gone wrong.  It helped my hair get back to original luster, shine,and overall health.  I changed shampoos and had half a bottle left that I held on to and am glad I did. My 5 yr old was having problems with baby shampoo and cobitioner making her hair weighed down and greesey.  It came to me to try this product since it is made of all great ingredients and was sulfur free.  It worked immediately!  She is no longer self concious.  Thank goodness for this product!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this shampoo and has been using it for several years.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, I have frizzy hair, really moisturizes and tames the frizz, the smoothing balm is also great really defines my curls</li>
    <li> awsome stuff...it worked great for me...my only gripe...it is pricy....</li>
    <li> This a staple shampoo that I use with two other shampoos.  I have used Eufora products and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I color my hair from time to time, and blowdry and straighten it a lot. Clearly my hair isn&#x27;t in the best condition. I started using this shampoo ever since I worked in a salon that carries the Eufora line of products. Ever since using this shampoo, my hair feels amazing! It is naturally thick, but now it feels super soft again. The shampoo is all organic, and safe for color treated hair. It smells wonderful, and a little bit will create a decent lather. Honestly if you&#x27;re like me and wash your hair every other day, this shampoo will last you 5 months. (The 2oz bottles lasted me a month.) I have thick hair, but use a little over a quarter size drop of this, and it really lathers all my hair and feels so clean. My hair is in better condition now too, and falls out/breaks off a lot less, and is so shiny, considering I&#x27;m styling it with heat a lot. I highly recommend Eufora products to anyone who wants better looking/feeling hair. :)</li>
    <li> Eufora was recommended to me since I have very fine hair. The product is very nice - not a heavy scent, and provides additional hydration to my hair in these very cold and winter conditions on the East Coast.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It smells good and does a great job!  I bought it with the Daily Balance Conditioner and I was disappointed with that conditioner because it was not hydrating enough.</li>
    <li> Easy on colored hair .  Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and works very well.  I would highly recommend it.  Shipped immediately.</li>
    <li> Been using it since 2007. This must have been an old shampoo on the shelf b/c it didn&#x27;t smell right and did not do its job...  since 07 this is my first bad expierence</li>
    <li> I have bought this product from a salon many times.  After I moved, I had trouble finding a salon in my area that sold it.  I decided to take a chance and order it online.  The shampoo I received is not clear, as it should be, and the smell is off.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo EVER!! Perfect for mist hair types. But maybe not so good for peeps w/ greasy hair.</li>
    <li> Only need less than a pea-size amount of shampoo and lathers up nicely. Works fantastic and has a nice fresh scent. Highly recommend!  Came shrink wrapped and packaged well.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser selected this line for me. I use about 5 different products. I love all of them. This leaves my hair clean, and crisp. I like the smell and like that I am not using harsh products on my hair anymore. The bottle lasts quite awhile and I use it with the hydrating shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product works so well on my thin hair, it hydrates the hair, without a heavy greasy feeling. My hair styles easier and I love the results. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Great item.  as described.  fast shipping.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has thinned and feels flat. From the first time I used Eufora shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s felt alive and is bouncy when I style it.  I can go an extra day between washes also.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative for me is the price, it&#x27;s quite a bit more than I will usually spend for the amount of product you get.</li>
