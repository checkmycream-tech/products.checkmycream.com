    <li> I like to spike the top of my hair. I add the gel to wet hair and let it dry. Boom. Later in the day I will brush it out and get rid of the spike look. But my hair still stays upright, soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy, it works, and only thing I use</li>
    <li> Someone gave me an older Jason gel and ingredients did not contain alcohol. I brought this product thinking it would be the same formula. Apparently the product formula has changed and they added alcohol. I would expect a product like this not to contain alcohol since I paid a premium for it.</li>
    <li> Controls fly aways and adds body without being too sticky!  This is the best gel, I love it!  For some reason the only place I can find it is Amazon (I&#x27;ve checked Whole Foods, Earth Fare, and the organic aisle at Kroger)... I&#x27;m so glad they are offering \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; shipping on it now.  I ran out and I have been using Nexxus instead and I am dying, I need my gel... a girl&#x27;s gotta have good hair ;)</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I&#x27;ve been using it a long time. It tames my curly hair and makes it shiny. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks for carrying it.</li>
    <li> I love this gel....it leaves my hair shiny and it holds my hair in place perfectly. I wasnt too sure about the fact that alcohol is one of its indgredients but for now it is alot better than the stuffy i was using before and its NATURAL!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  A little goes a long way.  Good deal from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Package received on time.  I have purchased several tubes of this gel.  It works very well at styling and holding the style all day long!  It gives it a nice shine.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I was loving this product and bought 3 more, however when I saw that &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; was the third ingredient I am now&lt;br /&gt;suspicious that it might be what has caused my hair to dry out, as alcohol is known to do that when it is in hair products. bo ho, as I thought&lt;br /&gt;I had found something I would use forever!!!!...just a caution for anyone with sensitive hair. Otherwise I love it.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this for my 3-year-old daughter, because her hair hasn&#x27;t yet decided if it wants to be curly or straight.

    <li> I bought Jason Hi-Shine Styling Gel hoping for a better performer than NEXXUS Extral Hold styling gel. JASON&#x27;s is NOT that.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair out of my eyes and when I actually cut it, hold it together nicely.  I hope Natural and Organic products continue to push companies towards what is right instead of what is profitable.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> A little pricey but anything that uses organic materials is probably going to be.  Regardless it holds through out the day and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
