      <li>Super convenient as a wipe!</li>
      <li>It takes too much pressure to get makeup removed, and they don&#x27;t feel nice.</li>
      <li>These facial cleaning towelettes work great.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a great value on Amazon as a similar store brand costs me $4.99 for 30.</li>
      <li>I tried the 15 count package and liked it so much I decided to buy this towelette in bulk.</li>
      <li>Feels soft and the cleans the makeup good.</li>
      <li>nice odor and clean all my make up thanks</li>
      <li>Afterwards I wash my face with another product to clean my pores.</li>
      <li>The quality of the Equate line can range from one end of the spectrum to the other, with most I&#x27;ve tried being of good quality.</li>
      <li>I think they would work better on those who don&#x27;t wear that much makeup.</li>
      <li>I love this product and I find it very comparable to the Ponds product.</li>
      <li>Also, they are a great value compared to other brands.</li>
      <li>like to start with a fresh clean face before I put makeup on.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re just looking for a quick way to remove your makeup, these are the way to go.</li>
      <li>They just don&#x27;t seem to be as strong or have as much cleanser.</li>
      <li>These clothes remove make-up easily and they are gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>Great item, I can slip a few out and put in a Zip-Lock if I travel.  </li>
      <li>Cheap and dries out fast</li>
      <li>They are cheap but really don&#x27;t remove the make-up.  </li>
      <li>and they dont cause me to breakout which is a rare find for anything that touches my skin</li>
      <li>I run though these pretty quickly</li>
      <li>and they clean your face very well.</li>
      <li>They are gentle and clean off all of my makeup.</li>
      <li>Just like bigger name brands, at better price (and I&#x27;m a bit of a product snob).</li>
      <li>I ordered these last week and am so glad I got them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought the same exact brand in store and they are MUCH better.</li>
      <li>I buy this at Walmart for $5, I wonder why it is more than double that here.</li>
      <li>So, this wasn&#x27;t much of a buy since I threw them right in the wastebasket.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a cheaper option too the facial cleanser cloths than I was originally buying!  </li>
      <li>I have combination sensitive skin and have been exclusively using these wipes to clean my face morning and night.</li>
      <li>I love the double pack and find them very convenient if I am in a hurry or traveling.  </li>
      <li>I will skip this in the future and spend a little more for better quality.</li>
      <li>even wetting them with water did not seem to help much.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have much to take off my face at that time but</li>
      <li>Gentle.  </li>
      <li>Very moist towels.  </li>
      <li>Really like them.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have as much liquid/wetness as Neutrogena</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Other brands do OK that way, but could be a bit moister for this process.  </li>
      <li>(why I first bought them - so I didn&#x27;t have to bring travel size containers of my face wash and use up precious space in my 3-1-1 baggie), but I now use them for everyday makeup removal too.</li>
      <li>They are not hard on my sensitive skin and the price is right for the quantity.</li>
      <li>I have combination sensitive skin and absolutely LOOOVE this product, but this same 2 pack of wipes is $ 5.97 at Walmart with free shipping.</li>
      <li>The price point was significantly less than the more prestigious brands, but the product was practically unusable.</li>
      <li>These have MORE than enough moisture to get everything off - I actually have to go over and over my face to feel that I am using all the product off the towel.  </li>
      <li>but this most recent pack that I bought has been different.</li>
      <li>After I use these my skin feels clean, refreshed and not too dry.</li>
      <li>I purchased these to save money on my normal Oil of Olay face wipes.</li>
      <li>Very soft and durable.</li>
      <li>Buyer beware, NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper option too the facial cleanser cloths than I was originally buying!  Well my search is no more, I&#x27;ve found them. These cloths work just as well or if not better than the names brand ones at half the price for the volume you get here. I will definitely purchase these again and again!</li>
    <li> Nice way to get off all the makeup, then my cleanser seems to be more effective. These are as good as Ponds and Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> Dont pay for name brand make up wipes. These work just as well for half the price. Really great for washing away make up at the end of the day or for a quick cleaning in the morning. After I use these my skin feels clean, refreshed and not too dry. Very soft and durable.</li>
    <li> These arrived basically all dried out and barely remove any makeup at all. I&#x27;ve bought the same exact brand in store and they are MUCH better. You&#x27;d be better off buying in store, even if they&#x27;re a tiny bit more expensive, if you want them to actually work and not just be dry paper towels</li>
    <li> The towels are cheap(cost-wise), and while they do work, they&#x27;re rough on your face. I use them to wipe off waterproof mascara and it&#x27;s unfortunately way too rough for the skin around my eyes :&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> I use these to remove my makeup every day. They are large so I typically rip them in half, which doubles the quantity!</li>
    <li> Love these cloths.  Great for removing waterproof mascara after a shower.  Gentle.  Nice smell.  Does not sting.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little rough on your skin and I find the formula of it stings my eyes a bit. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it after a long day or using it in the morning.</li>
    <li> Just as good as Neutrogena.  They stay damp, I don&#x27;t have to put them in a tub.  They don&#x27;t have as much liquid/wetness as Neutrogena so they take a little longer to get off eye makeup, but I like them for the price, and they do work well.</li>
    <li> the texture of the whips help get dirt and makeup off. The smell reminds me of baby whips though  and I don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> Great price and these are just as nice as the more well-known brands.  I run though these pretty quickly so I was a fan of the amount you get for the price.</li>
    <li> These facial cloths say they are similar to Ponds, and they are. They are not hard on my sensitive skin and the price is right for the quantity. I will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> The towelettes do look different than this picture but I was glad because they fit in my travel bag.  They stay moist which is not always the case with otherd</li>
    <li> Great! I like the nubby texture side.</li>
    <li> I buy this at Walmart for $5, I wonder why it is more than double that here. I love this product and I find it very comparable to the Ponds product.</li>
    <li> I love these! They are gentle and clean off all of my makeup. Super convenient as a wipe!</li>
    <li> They do the job for removing makeup, but are a little more dry than other wipes. They do the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these wipes for MANY years...but this most recent pack that I bought has been different. It smells really strong and it burns. Neither of those have EVER happened before. I&#x27;m not sure if I got a dud or what.</li>
    <li> Hardly any moisture.  Need 3 everytime I use it , wasteful</li>
    <li> Was disappointed when I used these.  Were not as moist as the Neutrogena ones I has previously ordered. Will not reorder this brand.</li>
    <li> Very moist towels.  I use the towel in the morning - don&#x27;t have much to take off my face at that time but like to start with a fresh clean face before I put makeup on.  Then I save that towel in a small jar to keep moist and use it again at night to get all the make up off.  Other brands do OK that way, but could be a bit moister for this process.  These have MORE than enough moisture to get everything off - I actually have to go over and over my face to feel that I am using all the product off the towel.  Which is very good for my face because I feel it is extremely clear of all makeup before going to bed. Will continue to buy these</li>
    <li> These work great. Remove face crud. Even gets mascara off. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the seal doesn&#x27;t stay closed so the towels dry up faster.</li>
    <li> Perfect cleansing cloth. One cloth takes off makeup totally, including mascara/eye makeup, and leaves skin feeling great with no rinsing needed, honest! Pleasant smell too, but it doesn&#x27;t linger in an annoying way. Will definitely keep these in stock always.</li>
    <li> Would not buy them again they are to dry!</li>
    <li> I love these wipes but they&#x27;re 5.97 in the stores!  What a ripoff!  Someone needs to do some better research :(</li>
    <li> These are cheaper than the ones you get a Walmart and they clean your face very well. I like them a lot!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes.  Just like bigger name brands, at better price (and I&#x27;m a bit of a product snob). Great for travel (why I first bought them - so I didn&#x27;t have to bring travel size containers of my face wash and use up precious space in my 3-1-1 baggie), but I now use them for everyday makeup removal too.</li>
    <li> nice odor and clean all my make up thanks</li>
    <li> Feels soft and the cleans the makeup good.</li>
    <li> I have combination sensitive skin and absolutely LOOOVE this product, but this same 2 pack of wipes is $ 5.97 at Walmart with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for several months now. Although they are a little lower quality than some of the other brands on the market, they&#x27;re much cheaper. I use them to remove my makeup and eyeliner. Afterwards I wash my face with another product to clean my pores. If you&#x27;re just looking for a quick way to remove your makeup, these are the way to go.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  I don&#x27;t think there is much difference in the more expensive&lt;br /&gt;brands, we all want to cut corners when possible. Price wise they are an excellent buy.  You get  twice as&lt;br /&gt;many as the other brands.</li>
    <li> I buy makeup removing wipes as a luxury, a convenience over washing my face before bed. This brand does not compare to Ponds, and I don&#x27;t like them. It takes too much pressure to get makeup removed, and they don&#x27;t feel nice.</li>
    <li> very good cleaner, will buy again</li>
    <li> I have used these face wipes religiously for 5+ years. I always pick them up at my local walmart. I get the TWO pack for $5 and some change. Don&#x27;t fall into this trap. $15 is outrageous!&lt;br /&gt;Now the product itself, I absolutely love. It comes with 120 wipes so they last a while. They effectively get all my makeup off of my face. I prefer these over the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I noticed someone said they had to wet theirs with water? I have never in 5+ years pulled out a dry wipe. The only reason I can see this happening is if the package was left open..&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, great wipes. Buy from walmart for $10 less.</li>
    <li> I always go for this brand of makeup remover. Works better than any name brand that I&#x27;ve used and you don&#x27;t have to scrub eye makeup off ( which is a no no. ) and the amount given alwys lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> These work as well as all the big name brands and at about a quarter of the price!!!</li>
    <li> Works great to&lt;br /&gt;Remove makeup</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffers!!! good price</li>
    <li> These were too dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.  I prefer the Meijer store brand- much more moist.</li>
    <li> These were hardly moist at all.  I have used others that I bought direct from the store that were sufficiently moist, but not this batch.  Won&#x27;t be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> Takes of my makeup, but burns my eyelids :-(</li>
    <li> Very effective on dirt and oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have combination sensitive skin and have been exclusively using these wipes to clean my face morning and night. They work great and help keep my break outs in check. There are two sides to each wipe; one smooth side and the other with little dots throughout. The dotted side is great if you want to gently exfoliate. I don&#x27;t have any issues with the wipes being too dry until maybe the last 3 or so. You can combat the issue by pouring a tiny bit of water into the package when the wipes get low. I would recommend storing these with the opening face down. I&#x27;ve found that this helps keep the wipe you&#x27;re about to use moist. Otherwise the top wipe tends to be dryer than I&#x27;d like. They&#x27;re a great value on Amazon as a similar store brand costs me $4.99 for 30.</li>
    <li> These Facial Cleansing Towelettes were &#x27;dry&#x27; when I opened them. So, this wasn&#x27;t much of a buy since I threw them right in the wastebasket.</li>
    <li> I tried the 15 count package and liked it so much I decided to buy this towelette in bulk. Unfortunately, this bigger package differ in 2 ways. The towelettes are slightly smaller in size. Plus, there&#x27;s not enough cleanser in the package. The towelettes are not moist enough and feel a little too dry to wipe with. I had to moisten them a bit with water.</li>
    <li> Barely moist towelettes. They are basically useless. I use them in the place of a washcloth for my face. I do add soap and water because they are very dry. What a waste of money</li>
    <li> The quality of the Equate line can range from one end of the spectrum to the other, with most I&#x27;ve tried being of good quality. This was not the case with this product. The price point was significantly less than the more prestigious brands, but the product was practically unusable. Nearly all of the towelettes in both packages were too dry to use and even wetting them with water did not seem to help much. If I wanted to do that, I&#x27;d just use a washcloth. I will skip this in the future and spend a little more for better quality. It hasn&#x27;t changed my mind on Equate products in general, but it has made me a little more leery about trying some of their other beauty items.</li>
    <li> Not Bad, These do what they say, seem to be a little less moist than the Neutrogena  wipes but these are less expensive and do work.  So yes I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> The two pack I received held wipes that seemed dry, with very little moisture.  The packages appeared sealed so I don&#x27;t think that was the problem.  Most towels like this make your face feel clean afterwards, these felt like there was a film left behind, like I needed to rinse my face off.  I won&#x27;t be orderinng these again.</li>
    <li> These clothes remove make-up easily and they are gentle on my skin. Also, they are a great value compared to other brands.</li>
    <li> I love these they remove all of my makeup including layers of mascara and they dont cause me to breakout which is a rare find for anything that touches my skin lol i would buy these from wally world though bc you can get this same twin pack for $5 - $6. Everyone who wears a little to a lot of makeup should purchase these wipe because they will leave your face completely clean. I also would recommend to anyone who acts in plays bc they actually remove horrible oily stage makeup, i actually had to buy another pack because everyone used them lol</li>
    <li> Were a little dry when opened package, but added a little water and are good for removing makeup.  Cheaper than other make up remover pads.</li>
    <li> These wipes are so dry I have use at least 6 or 7 to take off my makeup. I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> Great for the price, take my make up off ever night with them!</li>
    <li> Great bargain, very effective product!</li>
    <li> These two not remove waterproof mascara, as promised.  I will use them until they run out, but would not purchase again.  The packaging is not great, either.  I MUCH prefer the Neutrogena wipes, these have a texture that is a little rough for my skin.  Buyer beware, NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!</li>
    <li> i regret purchasing this product. I bought the 5 pack kirkland brand from costco and those were heavy duty and removed eye-makeup easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes were too dry. They were average size but not as big as the Neutrogena wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to dump liquid makeup remover to maintain moistness.</li>
    <li> I bought these hoping they would work as well as the other brands sold at Target.  They are cheap but really don&#x27;t remove the make-up.  I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> These facial cleaning towelettes work great. They got here so---fast!</li>
    <li> Gets the job done...removes almost all of my make up. I say almost only because -  after wiping with the towelettes and washing my face -  I also use Tend Skin on my chin and that has alcohol in it which gets EVERY dirt on the skin off. Another bonus of this items on Amazon and at Wal-Mart is that you get a lot for your money and the product does a great job at remove make up.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Good product.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to save money on my normal Oil of Olay face wipes. These are ok but not as good and I&#x27;ll continue to purchase the others in the future.  They just don&#x27;t seem to be as strong or have as much cleanser. The package was also a bit hard to open so it ripped and has been hard to keep them from not drying out.</li>
    <li> I love the double pack and find them very convenient if I am in a hurry or traveling.  Just enough texture to ensure cleaning but I would like a bit more moisture.  Over all a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these Equate Clean Facial Cleansing Towelettes.  I haven&#x27;t found anything that worked as well.  They effectively remove makeup and grime and have a clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Plus they have an affordable price!  I&#x27;ll be ordering more for sure.</li>
    <li> Great item, I can slip a few out and put in a Zip-Lock if I travel.  I use at least two a day.  Really like them.</li>
    <li> a little thin but good</li>
    <li> I ordered these last week and am so glad I got them. They are just like the store product and work great. Perfect after a long day of work to easily remove makeup</li>
    <li> Really thin wipes, but still get the job done.</li>
    <li> These wipes are a great deal.  Personally, I didn&#x27;t care for them. I didn&#x27;t like the texture, and they were not moist enough. However, I do wear long-lasting liquid foundation, and these wipes didn&#x27;t work well for removing my makeup at the end of the day. I think they would work better on those who don&#x27;t wear that much makeup.</li>
    <li> Cheap and dries out fast</li>
