    <li> This shampoo is very rich.  I have noticed a difference with the first washing of my hair, as being more manageable.  I didn&#x27;t even have the matching conditioner yet, which I will be receiving soon.  Its a blue color, but not on your hair.</li>
    <li> This really dried out my hair. I have very thick rather course hair, it is long, almost to my butt. I would not recommend this product, it&#x27;s too drying for me.</li>
    <li> Same as conditioner. I have used it before and like the way it makes my hair shine. I would encourage anyone with silvery white hair to use it. It gives your hair highlights.</li>

    <li> I cannot find Silver Expressions on any store shelves, so I am very glad that Amazon has it.  My hair is brown, gray and silver.  Before I started using this, the silver appeared a bit yellow.  The shampoo brings out the silver highlights. After the first couple of times that I used it I got compliments on the difference.  I also like the fact that it is not necessary to use it every day.  I will continue to use this shampoo as long as it is available.</li>

    <li> I have a mix of gray and black hair. My gray has grown in streaks, using Pantene shampoo for silver gray hair gives my hair shine and makes the gray pop. The gray now looks like silver with a shimmer. I get compliments on my hair color which is my natural hair color on a consistent basis. Excellent product. I am happy this product is available for people who has hair that dye does not adhere to. So I go natural and my silver gray hair glows and shines beautifully. My hair is exceptionally soft too, Thank you Pantene!!! I have recommended this product to others who now love it too,</li>
