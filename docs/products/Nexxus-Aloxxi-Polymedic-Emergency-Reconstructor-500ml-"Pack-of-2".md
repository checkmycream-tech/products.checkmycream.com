      <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer of this product</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s better to use an app of this product &amp;#34;weekly&amp;#34; until your hair is strong enough to be shampoo&#x27;d, than to try and rush things through.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>Apply the Nexxus Emergency (or Emergenee), and use a WIDE tooth comb to comb it through IF your hair is in good condition.</li>
      <li>I left this in overnight as I slept and rinsed it out with warm water in the morning.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super gentle!</li>
      <li>right before applying your heat-protectant product.</li>
      <li>It gives you brand new hair each time!!!</li>
      <li>My hair is SOFT, SMOOTH, SILKY, SHINY and hasincredible movement and bounce.  </li>
      <li>Nexxus Aloxxi Polymeric Emergency Reconstructor really works well for my hair!</li>
      <li>I first used it when it was under the Nexxus Emergencee label (vs the pro label of Aloxxi Polymedic Emergency....).</li>
      <li>U see results within the first two uses</li>
      <li>If you do not use a superb &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;, and then some type of &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; (or silicone serum, but I prefer coconut oil) to SEAL your hair&#x27;s cuticle layer, your protein treatment will be a fail.</li>
      <li>This can be expensive at the beauty suppliers, I was very happy to have found them.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for maintaining healthy hair as an occasional treatment for heat damage, added softness/sheen, also helps curls maintain strength &amp; shape.</li>
      <li>It would get tangled easily and break a lot when I brushed or even ran my fingers</li>
      <li>This product really works ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;After you rinse your hair, gently blot it to the damp stage.</li>
      <li>It works really well too.</li>
      <li>Their prices are reasonable.  </li>
      <li>, use a gentle clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>it was recommended to me for my damage hair and it is working very well, strengthening and helping with the breaking of my hair.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s very damaged, just work product through with</li>
      <li>Just make sure you have the moisturizer and all of the other products on hand BEFORE you begin the protein treatment.</li>
      <li>highly recommended to use</li>
      <li>Go buy this product today if your hair damaged from over processing with chemicals and high heat.</li>
      <li>Most clarifying shampoos are harsh.</li>
      <li>I did my shampoo &amp; condition as normal, then applied this evenly throughout my hair and combed it through.  </li>
      <li>I also began coloring my hair around age 23, taking it from dark chocolate brown, to light golden almost blonde.  </li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>ONLY other protein reconstructor that I have found to be AS EFFECTIVE as Emergencee/Emergency, is APHOGEE 2 Step Treatment (found only at Sally&#x27;s, I believe?).</li>
      <li>hair got SUPER STRETCHY while it was wet.</li>
      <li>This is another heavy duty serious protein reconstructor, -- actually it might be even a bit more effective, BUT it&#x27;s smelly</li>
      <li>I use this a couple times a month and it keeps my hair soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>My natural curl turned into wave and wouldn&#x27;t hold curl at all near the front.  </li>
      <li>I did the complete Aphogee Treatement, rinsed, and then did the Emergencee treatment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Leave it on for at least 10 minutes, though I leave it on for 30 min or more.</li>
      <li>When I straightened it,it stopped feeling smooth and sleek and felt brittle, damaged and stiff.  </li>
      <li>a dime size for long hair is good enough for this final step), and slick hair back into apony tail and let air-dry, if you can.</li>
      <li>The only negative is that it makes ur scalp kind of dry..just use as the bottle recommends every two weeks and a deep conditioner on alternate weeks.</li>
      <li>tried a few other inexpensive treatments available at Target, CVS, etc.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The salon gave me several of these &amp;#34;Emergencee&amp;#34; treatments over the next several weeks, and my hair was actually saved from breaking off completely.</li>

<li> I began flat ironing my hair on a regular basis when I was about 17, I am 27 now.  </li>
<li> It SNAPPED back when stretched, and then got squiggly</li>
<li> I use it faithfully every 8 weeks, as I bleach/highlight my hair, blowdry, and sometimes flat iron.</li>
<li> It feels soft and less breakage too.</li>
<li> I ended up buying it far less than I would have bought it at my salon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 16 years or more now. Probably more. I first used it when it was under the Nexxus Emergencee label (vs the pro label of Aloxxi Polymedic Emergency....). They are the same product, in terms of results, though I think label ingredients may be listed as being a bit different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you:&lt;br /&gt;-color your hair&lt;br /&gt;-BLEACH your hair&lt;br /&gt;-perm or chemically relax your hair&lt;br /&gt;-and/or blow dry and/or flat iron the heck out of your hair....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And:&lt;br /&gt;-your hair feels dry&lt;br /&gt;-looks like straw&lt;br /&gt;-STRETCHES when wet, due to OVER-bleaching or other chemical processing&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t seem to get better despite conditioners and/or hot oil treatments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY!&lt;br /&gt;GET IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;__________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product saved my hair years ago when a salon FRIED my hair during a highlight session. :(&lt;br /&gt;My hair got SUPER STRETCHY while it was wet. It SNAPPED back when stretched, and then got squiggly and ....OH MY G*D. Let&#x27;s just say it was horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salon gave me several of these &amp;#34;Emergencee&amp;#34; treatments over the next several weeks, and my hair was actually saved from breaking off completely. I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer of this product ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first had my hair bleaching disaster, I actually began using 2 different protein reconstructors one after the other in the same treatment (see below: Aphogee), but after the initial few treatments, I used mainly only the Emergency product for ease. Both are fabulous products, though!&lt;br /&gt;____&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use:&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is in pretty good condition (ie, NOT falling apart!), use a gentle clarifying shampoo. I love KENDRA&#x27;s. It&#x27;s super gentle! Most clarifying shampoos are harsh. However ,if your hair is at the &amp;#34;TOXIC and breaking off stage&amp;#34;, forget the clarifying formula! Use the gentlest shampoo you can, or just omit shampoo and wet your hair and apply. When your hair is THAT fragile, you have to take baby steps. It&#x27;s better to use an app of this product &amp;#34;weekly&amp;#34; until your hair is strong enough to be shampoo&#x27;d, than to try and rush things through. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so after you shampoo, towel try your hair. Do NOT apply conditoner...unless your hair is at that &amp;#34;toxic and breaking off stage&amp;#34;. Conditioner will lessen the effect of this protein treatment, however, when your hair is MELTING, you do what you have to do to create some &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; when the hair is wet...so if you need to use conditioner, use it. Just know you will need several protein treatments in the next few days or weeks. It&#x27;s worth it to go slow, and while this product is NOT cheap, you definitely get what you pay for. It&#x27;s woth the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you rinse your hair, gently blot it to the damp stage. Apply the Nexxus Emergency (or Emergenee), and use a WIDE tooth comb to comb it through IF your hair is in good condition. If it&#x27;s very damaged, just work product through with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on for at least 10 minutes, though I leave it on for 30 min or more. That is how it works best for me, so....?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a good quality &amp;#34;moisturizing conditioner&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t skimp on this if your hair is super damaged. I love Paul Mitchell Super Charged Moisturizer. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it. If you can&#x27;t splurge, use Tresemme Platinum Strength Conditioner (or try Loreal&#x27;s Nature&#x27;s Therapy Mega Moisture&amp;#34; conditioner. Leave on at least 20 min or longer. The longer, the better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse conditioner out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply some coconut oil on your hair. Leave on as long as you can before you rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing coconut oil out, style as usual. IF your hair is fried, I would advise against blow drying. You&#x27;re better off to just add in more coconut oil (a dime size for long hair is good enough for this final step), and slick hair back into apony tail and let air-dry, if you can. If you can&#x27;t, then consider rolling hair in curlers and letting air dry. Do whatever you can to avoid using &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; for a while IF your hair is at the breaking off stage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, just writing that procedure brings me back to those days when I had to deal with the over bleaching tragedy. NOT a fun time. But, thankfully, I had Emergency to help me through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer suffer &amp;#34;salon mishaps&amp;#34; as I learned to do my own highlights. But I ALWAYS have Emergency in my closet. I use it faithfully every 8 weeks, as I bleach/highlight my hair, blowdry, and sometimes flat iron. They say that you can never truly &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; hair damage, but this product gets you as close to &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; as you could ever hope to! it WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:&lt;br /&gt;Use Redken Anti Snap as a final step right before applying your heat-protectant product. Anti Snap is another must-have for those who chemically damage and/or heat damage their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY other protein reconstructor that I have found to be AS EFFECTIVE as Emergencee/Emergency, is APHOGEE 2 Step Treatment (found only at Sally&#x27;s, I believe?). This is another heavy duty serious protein reconstructor, -- actually it might be even a bit more effective, BUT it&#x27;s smelly (peeee-ewwwww! lol), and it&#x27;s VERY time consuming (must be dried-into the hair until your hair is stiff, and don&#x27;t dare manipulate hair while it&#x27;s in that stage or it can break off!). Emergency smells nice, takes a much shorter time to use, and is easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:&lt;br /&gt;Initially, because my hair was fried so bad from the salon bleaching service, I began to use both the Aphogee and the Emergencee treatments (in that order). I did the complete Aphogee Treatement, rinsed, and then did the Emergencee treatment. Then, I followed with the &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;, and then the coconut oil, Anti Snap, etc. This may seem like overkill to some, but when you see your hair literally MELTING off before your eyes, you wouldn&#x27;t think it was overkill. If your hair is not as damaged as that, then using either the Emergencee or the Aphogee will suffice. But if you are at that end-stage of hair disaster, you may want to consider doing one treatment after the other. Just make sure you have the moisturizer and all of the other products on hand BEFORE you begin the protein treatment. If you do not use a superb &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;, and then some type of &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; (or silicone serum, but I prefer coconut oil) to SEAL your hair&#x27;s cuticle layer, your protein treatment will be a fail.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the name.  I usually order this through a local distributor.  If you research this product there are people who charge triple for what this company does.  Their prices are reasonable.  We all need to make a living.  Their shipping is fast, and they have a great selection of products.  In addition, there are always sales, so if you are looking for a great deal, keep checking back.  I like this place and continue to order, which isn&#x27;t simply for me, I have clients so I know I can trust them as in the years I have ordered from them, they haven&#x27;t let me down.  They also toss in extra samples which is not necessary, but shows they care.  I will repurchase as well as recommend this store.</li>
    <li> I saw this product at my salon. I almost bought it and then I decided to check Amazon. I ended up buying it far less than I would have bought it at my salon. It works really well too. I could see the difference in my hair already. It feels soft and less breakage too. Awesome, awesome that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
    <li> excelent service, and fast delivery, the product was great, I am very happy I purchased the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nexxus Aloxxi Emergency works well on your hair</li>
    <li> Excellent product . I always used this product for my relaxed and dye hair, helps reconstruct my hair structure.</li>
    <li> This product really works ... The only negative is that it makes ur scalp kind of dry..just use as the bottle recommends every two weeks and a deep conditioner on alternate weeks. U see results within the first two uses</li>
    <li> Nexxus Aloxxi Polymeric Emergency Reconstructor really works well for my hair! Go buy this product today if your hair damaged from over processing with chemicals and high heat.</li>
    <li> This is my fav product to make my hair curly. This can be expensive at the beauty suppliers, I was very happy to have found them.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair Emergency Reconstructor saved  my hair when I put color and had terrible breakage. I used this product religiously every other week and my hair was restored in a few months. It is best to apply and sit under the dryer for 10 minutes. It will harden on your hair so you will need to wash it out. After washing it I recommend using a rinse to comb through your hair. I still use this product even after my hair is back to it&#x27;s glory. I use it once a month as part of my deep conditioning treatments.</li>
    <li> The product came on time.  I love it.  I have ordered from this vendor before and was not disappointed.  I have used this product for at least three years.  It&#x27;s a good conditioner and hair Reconstructor.</li>
    <li> Some of the best stuff on Earth for deep treatment/conditioning. Try it over night...results &#x3D; amazeballs!</li>
    <li> Great product expecially for the price.  Delivered on time as expected.</li>
    <li> Its great. It strengthens the hair. It hardens when it dries so i use it like gel although the instructions say to rinse it out. Its great for tightly curled hair or hair that has been heat damaged.</li>
    <li> My daughter over-bleached her hair to the point it felt like cotton and was falling out!  This turned her hair back into hair again!  It&#x27;s the most amazing thing for hair repair I&#x27;ve ever used or heard of.  I have thick, course, wavy hair that I have colored/highlighted/straightened all the time.  I use this a couple times a month and it keeps my hair soft and silky.  It&#x27;s amazing.  Simply amazing!</li>
    <li> Only in a larger bottle. Purchased numerous times and will purchase many more. Highly recommended for maintaining healthy hair as an occasional treatment for heat damage, added softness/sheen, also helps curls maintain strength &amp; shape. I always follow with a super moisturizing conditioner as using this alone can make hair feel dry, hard and crunchy.</li>
    <li> Great product to buy. Give your thick heathy look w/ body.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible!  If you are looking for a solution for dry, damaged, over-styled or colored hair, this is it!  I have naturally long, thick, curly hair- it was always a love it or hate it for me when it came to styling.  I began flat ironing my hair on a regular basis when I was about 17, I am 27 now.  I also began coloring my hair around age 23, taking it from dark chocolate brown, to light golden almost blonde.  Needless to say, between the color and the heat, my hair took a beating.  My natural curl turned into wave and wouldn&#x27;t hold curl at all near the front.  When I straightened it,it stopped feeling smooth and sleek and felt brittle, damaged and stiff.  It would get tangled easily and break a lot when I brushed or even ran my fingers through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few other inexpensive treatments available at Target, CVS, etc.  They were OK in making my hair feel better immediately following my shower, but that&#x27;s where the results stopped.  My mom used Nexxus Emergencee years ago to bring bounce back to her curls and it worked wonders.  My sister also used it for an entire summer, using a small amount mixed with water to style her curls instead of using a gel or mousse.  She grew her hair from mid back length to her butt in just over 3 months.  I grew up using Nexxus products, so I decided to give this a go again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say- WOW!  100% difference.  I did my shampoo &amp; condition as normal, then applied this evenly throughout my hair and combed it through.  I put my hair in a low, slicked pony and let it air dry.  I left this in overnight as I slept and rinsed it out with warm water in the morning.  Then I followed with a 2 hour application of Nexxus Emergencee (Which I also ordered).  I did not apply heat, instead let my curls air dry with the product in.  Immediately I noticed that my curls were already back.  I decided to straighten my hair for the ultimate test.  I could not be happier!  My hair is SOFT, SMOOTH, SILKY, SHINY and hasincredible movement and bounce.  Even my boyfriend noticed.  I keep touching my hair in disbelief and joy!  It&#x27;s like night and day.  I wish I could upload a photo to show how incredibly healthy my hair looks after just one treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue this routine every two weeks to get my hair in the best condition and health possible.  This is a miracle product.  If you are thinking about buying it, do it!!!</li>
    <li> This is a reconstructor and does softener your hair. There are other reconstructor on the market as well that are just as good, like those made my Frederic Fekkai.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product I highly recommend if you have processed hair,  for me is the best product for fine and processed hair, you need to read the recommendation how to use it, but is a quality product.</li>
    <li> Excellent, excellent, excellent! I swear by it!!! When my clients &amp;#34;wander&amp;#34; off (lol) and try at home styling for their hair and they come back to me to repair, this product literally saves the day!!! I use it on my own hair as well. It gives you brand new hair each time!!!</li>
    <li> IVe been using this product for YEARS and iot has never ever failed me. i have not found anything one bit close to this reconstructor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is fantastic!!! Its like a 2 for 1 combo. the price i pay for these two is the price i pay for one buying it at a local store.</li>
    <li> Nothing beats emergency for curl activation and hold, I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years and I still can&#x27;t find anything that does a better job</li>
    <li> it was recommended to me for my damage hair and it is working very well, strengthening and helping with the breaking of my hair.  I recommend it for us who relax our hair</li>
    <li> Is the best product I have been using it for more than 15 years. My girls use it I would not change this product for anything else I try other products but don&#x27;t leave my nexus emergency is the Best !!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product intact</li>
