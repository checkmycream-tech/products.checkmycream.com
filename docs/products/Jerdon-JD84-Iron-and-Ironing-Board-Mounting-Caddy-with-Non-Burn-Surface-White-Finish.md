      <li>Recommended for sure!!!!</li>
      <li>and it makes me happy!</li>
      <li>Perfect and well designed and manufactured.  </li>
      <li>Very good for the price!</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, it is excellent for mounting on a wall.  </li>
      <li>One thing to keep in mind about the board mount is that it is probably best used with a board that has a T shape on the end of the leg.</li>
      <li>But considering the price, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>This is just perfect for what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>This caddy is great for storing the iron out of the way in tidy fashion.</li>
      <li>I also like the cord holder because it does a good job of keeping it in place.</li>
      <li>Separating the board hooks and the iron holder is a brilliant idea--a one-piece unit (as most are) wouldn&#x27;t have worked in my space.  </li>

      <li>I already have a very secure metal ironing board holder</li>
      <li>BUT...while the description say &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; finish, it is more of a beige or crepe color.  </li>
      <li>Household Essentials 144211 Over-the-Door Ironing Board with Steel Mesh Top]]</li>
      <li>I like the fact that the board and iron mounts are separate pieces, because it gives you a lot more flexibility about where you locate things.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s when I was glad this product gave me the option to choose.  </li>
      <li>It is sturdy and durable, so I am now satisfied.</li>
      <li>It worked great and holds the iron and the cord very well.  </li>
      <li>Sure the cheese would get stuck to the holder</li>
      <li>so I was able to mount separately.</li>
      <li>-- yes, I may be more paranoid than some.</li>
      <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>I wanted to like this iron caddy because the price is excellent and the plastic feels solid and durable.  </li>
      <li>It looks nice and is exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>It is not the most exciting purchase, but we use it every day!</li>
      <li>This organizer is so easy to install</li>
      <li>The products are sturdy and were easy to install.  </li>
      <li>The iron will set in the holder but can easily fall out.  </li>
      <li>Space saving and easy to install.  </li>
      <li>Mounting was easy.</li>
      <li>This unit is easy to install and fits both my iron and ironing board without a problem.</li>
      <li>The wire used in the hook is about 1/8\\&quot; in diameter, and works best if the load is directly down, as opposed to a leg with a Y shape to it.</li>
      <li>But, for my cheep ironing board its fine.</li>
      <li>just fine.  </li>
      <li>Ironing caddy surface is plastic and my iron doesn&#x27;t fit, it&#x27;s still stored on a shelf.</li>
      <li>the detachable ironing board caddy was great for us since we only needed the iron holder.</li>
      <li>but it blended in well and didn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
      <li>Well worth the cost and plan on purchasing more for our clients.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great finally having someplace to put my iron and ironing board so that they are out of the way.  </li>
      <li>The picture  side clips that hold the iron in securely.</li>
      <li>If you have a regular, older or \\&quot;college dorm\\&quot; size iron this will work perfectly.  </li>
      <li>The \\&quot;side car\\&quot; on the main unit held the cord nicely.</li>
      <li>this makes it very sturdy and safe.</li>
      <li>Also, Amazon states this is a non-burn, non-scorch surface, but the instructions say to let the iron cool before storing.</li>
      <li>Iron caddies are super convenient...</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Luckily, that still worked with our color scheme, but &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; it is not.  </li>
      <li>Very sturdy and easy to put up.</li>
      <li>I will check out amazon for another but read the reviews first!</li>
      <li>(as far as I can tell, most of these are plastic)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>So I bought this several years ago and never planned on writing a review about, but here I came across this again and considering how well it has held up the last couple of years, it deserved a good review!  </li>
      <li>my iron fell right off of the unit.</li>
      <li>(you can see it placed on the right of the caddy in this photo).</li>
      <li>It works, but again, shame on you Amazon for allowing more communist Chinese items in my shopping cart...let me have the info!</li>
      <li>I will updated the review once I know that no damage occurs with hot iron.</li>
      <li>I have not tried to store the iron hot yet but that is my plan.</li>
      <li>I stayed at the Howard Johnson Hotel, and in there closet saw for the first time the Iron &amp; Ironing Board Caddy, by Jerdon.</li>
      <li>Since I first wrote this review, I kept the caddy and am using it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve put my hot iron away with no problems.  </li>
      <li>Can put in a hot iron without worry.  </li>
      <li>I can set the hot iron on it without any problem.</li>
      <li>It is pretty sturdy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally did!  </li>
      <li>I was looking for one which I could immediately place my piping hot iron after I used to make grilled cheese.</li>
      <li>You cannot put a hot iron in this.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what we were looking for.</li>
      <li>The hooks hold both types of ironing board legs, which was nice because we got a new board that had different legs after we had already bought and hung this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The manufacturer was smart to make it a separate piece</li>
      <li>The plastic seems to be good quality, with a hard matte finish toward the iron -</li>
      <li>It is very well made.  </li>
      <li>The plastic used is very sturdy and except for the fact it doesn&#x27;t work I really like the product.</li>
      <li>The picture shows it as being white, but it&#x27;s a light tan.  </li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>Though it&#x27;s plastic, it&#x27;s very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works as described. My only critique would be that the hangers for the board itself seem a little feeble. But, for my cheep ironing board its fine. Recommended for sure!!!!</li>
    <li> This organizer is so easy to install and it is a nice addition to the closet</li>
    <li> I live in a tiny apartment, and wanted to purchase something like this for a long time.  I&#x27;m so glad I finally did!  It&#x27;s great finally having someplace to put my iron and ironing board so that they are out of the way.  The products are sturdy and were easy to install.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The product is fine, except all the pictures show that it has little arms that hold the iron on the caddy and when I took the product out of the box, it did not have those arms.  It would work, except I don&#x27;t want it to fall out accidentally on my kids (Ouch).  So I rated it low soley on that reason.</li>
    <li> It perfectly accommodated my iron for a neat storage and also heatprrof and can be used to store a hot iron...no waiting for it to cool down.</li>
    <li> Received the unit without arms shown in the picture. The plastic sides are tapered inward but without those little arms in the front my iron fell right off of the unit. I have a regular size iron. The plastic used is very sturdy and except for the fact it doesn&#x27;t work I really like the product. I&#x27;m going to the hardware store to see if I can buy something that will act like the little arms that are shown in the picture. I bought this item even though there was one review that said the unit that the reviewer purchased did not come with arms. It was the only review of that nature so I thought the reviewer received a defective unit and decided to gamble. Obviously I lost. So if you iron is just the right size,not to big or small, the product will work great.&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;I went to the hardware store and bought plastic shims and drilled a hole in them and through the side where the arms are suppose to be. I did both sides and attached them with screws and now the iron stays in the holder.</li>
    <li> I bought this and installed on a over-the-door ironing board.  It worked great and holds the iron and the cord very well.  Had to get different mounting hardware for my application because produce only comes with wall mounting hardware.  This is the only iron holder that I have seen that will mount on an over-the-door ironing board.[[ASIN:B002SJL3ZC Household Essentials 144211 Over-the-Door Ironing Board with Steel Mesh Top]]</li>
    <li> Ironing shirts is not a favorite task, but knowing I can immediately put the still-hot iron away when I am finished really helps in getting the job done.  The price on this item was so reasonable and we had looked everywhere for something similar.  It is not the most exciting purchase, but we use it every day!</li>
    <li> Bought the Jerdon Ironing Board Caddy for a rental so price was very important. This unit is easy to install and fits both my iron and ironing board without a problem. Didn&#x27;t like the placement of the cord caddy--it was difficult to stuff the cord into the tiny box that they provide (you can see it placed on the right of the caddy in this photo). Plus, there isn&#x27;t a spot for the water cup. But considering the price, I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Great to organize closet or were ever you keep your iron/board. I installed iron holder and board hooks separately which works great.</li>
    <li> On my trip to San Juan, P.R., this January of 2010. I stayed at the Howard Johnson Hotel, and in there closet saw for the first time the Iron &amp; Ironing Board Caddy, by Jerdon. The only exception was that the one they had was truly first class. It was made of cast aluminium and not plastic like the one I got from Amazon. It probably should cost only $5.00 and not 9.99, but it does keep your Iron &amp; Ironing Board organized.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for storing an iron and ironing board.  It works very well.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time in hotels on business and I see these iron caddys in all the major chains. But I searched all the department stores for one I could purchase for home and I finally gave up! Don&#x27;t waste your time looking, just go online and buy! I am a very tidy person and I love everything in it&#x27;s place.. This caddy is great for storing the iron out of the way in tidy fashion. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I am sure this would work for some irons, but it was too small for mine.  I measured before ordering, but was unable to tell exactly how big the caddy would be and my iron did not fit.  I would say &amp;#34;buyer beware&amp;#34; if you have a largish iron.  The worst thing was that it cost me the price of the purchase to return the thing!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It holds the Iron snug and has a strap to hold it in also...this makes it very sturdy and safe. It looks nice and is exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> were not let down by quality of product.  the detachable ironing board caddy was great for us since we only needed the iron holder.</li>
    <li> Now my iron has its own place on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic is sturdy and seems heat resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds my iron.</li>
    <li> Meets requirements.  Dismayed that this had to be made in China (amazon, hint hint, country of origin isn&#x27;t difficult to provide).  Typically Chinese authored instructions didn&#x27;t explain the purpose of some extra washers included, but the install was straightforward. This is the same iron holder found in almost every Hilton or Marriott hotel built in the last 20 years. It works, but again, shame on you Amazon for allowing more communist Chinese items in my shopping cart...let me have the info!</li>
    <li> I attached this holder in my Master walk-in closet up on the side of my cabinet and on the adjacent.  I had intended to put it up as one unit but then decided to put the iron holder and the board holder up separately due to space constraints and ease of reach issues.  That&#x27;s when I was glad this product gave me the option to choose.  I also liked the quality and look. Nothing fancy but it blended in well and didn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
    <li> All pictures show this product with retainer elbows to secure the iron in place, especially when mounting on the back of a door. Fact is, there are NO RETAINER ELBOWS AT ALL. Poor rating for false advertising.</li>
    <li> Very nice that you can separate the ironing board holder from the iron holder.  Holds cord well too.  Mounting was easy.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this iron caddy because the price is excellent and the plastic feels solid and durable.  The problem is that my iron does not fit inside.  Many newer irons these days have larger bases and wider plates for convenience and safety, so they will not fit in the Jerdon caddy.  If you have a regular, older or \\&quot;college dorm\\&quot; size iron this will work perfectly.  If you have something that&#x27;s larger like my T-Fal Ultraglide or any of the irons that have retractable cords, this won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> a great addition to my laundry room. this item was easy to install.it takes up a small area of this room.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and product was what I expected. Only used to hold iron and cord, not ironing board. Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Ironing caddy surface is plastic and my iron doesn&#x27;t fit, it&#x27;s still stored on a shelf. Too inexpensive to bother with returning.</li>
    <li> As noted by a few of the other low-star reviews, there are no side arms or clips to keep the iron in place. I live in earthquake country and I have a toddler -- yes, I may be more paranoid than some. But the iron holder sits nearly parallel to the wall in this holder, so it would not take much to get a top-heavy iron to fall out of this. I&#x27;m tossing this in the garbage, sadly.</li>
    <li> Its been working as designed for about a month and complaints. Iron caddies are super convenient...go for it, get one.</li>
    <li> Though it&#x27;s plastic, it&#x27;s very sturdy.  I installed it on wall in my laundry room and was afraid that the iron would fall off as it didn&#x27;t seem to have much support but amazingly, my iron does stay put.  I already have a very secure metal ironing board holder so I didn&#x27;t need that hook.  The manufacturer was smart to make it a separate piece so I could just leave it off.</li>
    <li> Same iron holder as in hotels.  Good quality.  Can put in a hot iron without worry.  Comes with mounting hardware.</li>
    <li> Clearly the product is not white, even though the manufacturer&#x27;s box/packaging label shows as white. I have had to return two of these to Amazon because of this problem.</li>
    <li> My JD84 is installed and worked out great. I like the fact that the board and iron mounts are separate pieces, because it gives you a lot more flexibility about where you locate things. I also like the cord holder because it does a good job of keeping it in place. One thing to keep in mind about the board mount is that it is probably best used with a board that has a T shape on the end of the leg. The wire used in the hook is about 1/8\\&quot; in diameter, and works best if the load is directly down, as opposed to a leg with a Y shape to it. The Y shape tends to distort the hook outward. Mine is Y shaped, and here is how I dealt with it: I drilled a hole in each leg about 10 inches from the end near the floor and then added a #6 1.5\\&quot; threaded bolt with two capture nuts in each hole. When I put the board into the mount, the bolt catches on the wire and hold at roughly the same width as it is without a board in the mount. A recommendation to Jerdon: weld a cross brace horizonally between the two hooks, and it will handle all types of board legs.</li>
    <li> I like that is comes in two pieces so I was able to mount separately. It seems nice and study when I hung with a few anchors. The \\&quot;side car\\&quot; on the main unit held the cord nicely. The hooks hold both types of ironing board legs, which was nice because we got a new board that had different legs after we had already bought and hung this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only dislike it plastic is hard but feels like it could crack when hit hard, but it hasn&#x27;t been an issue yet. I only bring it up because we hung it behind a door and the door opens into it.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what we were looking for. We installed this on the back of our laundry door, and it totally got our iron and ironing board organized and out of the way nicely.</li>
    <li> I like the separate board hook. I hang the ironing board behind my laundry room door and the iron above the washing machine. Keeps them both completely out of the way without wasting space.</li>
    <li> At the time I purchased this there are no warnings on the description. You cannot put a hot iron in this. You have to wait until the iron cools. I was looking for one which I could immediately place my piping hot iron after I used to make grilled cheese. Sure the cheese would get stuck to the holder but I just leave it there for a few months to let it age. Then sell it at the local farmers market claiming its exotic aged cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the description had warned me I could not do what I wanted with it I would have never have purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it loses rating for someone being too lazy to type a little extra.</li>
    <li> Separating the board hooks and the iron holder is a brilliant idea--a one-piece unit (as most are) wouldn&#x27;t have worked in my space.  My only complaint: the cord caddy fits onto the right side of the iron holder only.  It would have been simple to design the unit so the cord holder could be attached to either side.</li>
    <li> This holder is a very tight fit for my Rowenta Steam Iron</li>
    <li> So I bought this several years ago and never planned on writing a review about, but here I came across this again and considering how well it has held up the last couple of years, it deserved a good review!  It is pretty sturdy, I put it behind the closet hallway door so it can be hidden away.  Very good for the price!</li>
    <li> It is very well made.  BUT...while the description say &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; finish, it is more of a beige or crepe color.  Luckily, that still worked with our color scheme, but &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; it is not.  That&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give a &amp;#34;five star&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This caddy is not designed to be mounted on a door.  The reason being that there is no strap to hold the iron in place.  When the door moves, the iron will fall out.    HOWEVER, it is excellent for mounting on a wall.  I have that 1500 watt Hamilton Beach iron and it sits in there just fine.  The base of my iron doesn&#x27;t sit in the \\&quot;cup\\&quot; of the caddy, but it leans forward against the wall perfectly anyway.  I&#x27;d have to slam into my iron in order to dislodge it when mounted.  The cable stay is also a really nice feature to have.  It means I&#x27;m not gonna trip over it and pull the iron off the caddy.    You can mount the ironing board hanger under the caddy or seperately.  I chose seperately and put both of them inconspicuously in my walk-in closet.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use this item.  The picture shows it as being white, but it&#x27;s a light tan.  Too bad they didn&#x27;t list that in the description.</li>
    <li> I purchased this ironing board wall caddy after being so frustrated yanking out my ironing board with other items spilling out and having to leave my hot iron out and then put it up later.  Boy am I happy with my purchase!  It is an expensive fix to store your hot iron and hang your ironing board out of the way.  The caddy can be separated and you are able to mount the iron and ironing board attachments on separate walls, which worked out best for our storage area.  I&#x27;ve put my hot iron away with no problems.  There is also a slot to put the wrapped cord in so that it isn&#x27;t messy looking.  Think of when you&#x27;ve been to a hotel and the iron is nicely tucked away?...that&#x27;s what I come home to and it makes me happy!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. Arrived quickly. Worth the money. Excellent product. Just like in the hotels. Very sturdy and easy to put up.</li>
    <li> Got this installed in about 10 minutes, nothing complicated at all.  It&#x27;s a little large for my iron, but it still works since the base slants back to the wall a bit so i know it won&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> Finally, the ironing board is no longer behind the bedroom door, and no more hot iron sitting on the ironing board waiting for me to bump into it and drop it on my toe!</li>
    <li> This looked like the perfect storage solution for my iron. It&#x27;s well designed and it is very nice that the iron and ironing board can be mounted separately. Unfortunately the metal bracket that is supposed to fit behind the plastic mount for the board does not fit. The \\&quot;U\\&quot; shaped metal hanger is too short to span the screw holes. Hopefully this is just a defective one and yours will not be. I will return this one. Also, Amazon states this is a non-burn, non-scorch surface, but the instructions say to let the iron cool before storing. The entire unit is plastic, so placing a hot iron in it doesn&#x27;t seem sensible. Maybe letting the iron cool slightly is the answer. The plastic seems to be good quality, with a hard matte finish toward the iron - so maybe it is heat resistant. But non-burn and non-scorch? Not so sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 2013 - Since I first wrote this review, I kept the caddy and am using it. I finally got the metal bracket to fit - I forced it and voila - it bent and snapped into place. It is sturdy and durable, so I am now satisfied.</li>
    <li> Listed as being WHITE.  It is NOT.  It is ALMOND in color.  If you want white, this item is not for you.</li>
    <li> The package arrived as expected however as others have mentioned the strap shown in the pictures is not included. I have not tried to store the iron hot yet but that is my plan. I will updated the review once I know that no damage occurs with hot iron.</li>
    <li> Returned this, it did not come like the picture.</li>
    <li> Its plastic, its not beautiful, but its nicely designed and really does the job.  I have it mounted on the wall next to my wall mounted fold down ironing board, and it doesn&#x27;t get any more convenient than that.  I can set the hot iron on it without any problem.</li>
    <li> How often do you iron?  If its not much, then why pay a lot for an iron caddy?  I&#x27;m not pulling this thing on and off the wall daily, or even weekly.  (We dry clean a lot of husband&#x27;s shirts, etc).  So, I didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for something like this.  This is just perfect for what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I purchased this instead of another, more expensive option?&lt;br /&gt;1) I just wanted to get organized, but didn&#x27;t want to pay too much for a few pieces of plastic (as far as I can tell, most of these are plastic)&lt;br /&gt;2) It comes with both iron and board caddies.  Both pieces are plenty sturdy, I anchored one of the screws on a stud for both pieces.&lt;br /&gt;3) The iron caddy comes with a cord holder, which makes a big difference to me as wrapping the cord around the iron never seems to stay.&lt;br /&gt;4) Looks nice on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no complaints!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t get hot, easy to install, looks and feels like is made of good quality.For the price you can go wrong.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of iron holder and board holder are separate.  Unfortunaly, the base of my Rowenta Iron does not fit (too wide for holder) and I returned the item.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews on this iron holder before i ordered it. The picture  side clips that hold the iron in securely. The iron will set in the holder but can easily fall out.  I had planned to mount mine on the back of the laundry room door, but am returning it instead.  I will check out amazon for another but read the reviews first!</li>
    <li> Perfect and well designed and manufactured.  Space saving and easy to install.  Well worth the cost and plan on purchasing more for our clients.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviewers noted, ours did not come with the strap shown in the picture. Though it seems like the iron will not fall out, we have put a string around it to tie the iron into place for extra security. Other than that flaw, it seems to be doing the job.</li>
    <li> Very easy directions to follow. Finally have a place to store my iron and ironing board. You can install them in different places if you need to. My iron is in the laundry room with my washer/dryer, but there was no room there for the board so it is out in the garage.</li>
