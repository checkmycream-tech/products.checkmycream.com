      <li>Unless you are Rapunzel, your hair should fit.</li>

      <li>Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, this great shower cap is a big help for a quick shower before I go out.</li>
      <li>Works great Love how it is tight fitted.</li>
      <li>Just your standard shower cap with good, comfortable elastic.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Many hotesl no longer provide a shower cap in their bathrooms, do having these is a real necessity for me.  </li>
      <li>Good quality...fit that big hairdo of my wife&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Good enough shower cap for the money.</li>
      <li>At last a good quality shower cap that fits snugly over my head and keeps the water out.</li>
      <li>Yes, you can get fancier, and yes, you can pay a whole lot more.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery</li>
      <li>Plus, it is very pretty.</li>
      <li>Awesome and long lasting.</li>
      <li>I could easily fit twice as much in there and have some room to spare.</li>
      <li>They are made well and offered at a very reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my wife and she loves it, and plans to buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>It is really cute, the material is okay, but is way to small to cover my hair up.</li>
      <li>And that is exactly what it is.  </li>
      <li>tea Large won&#x27;t order any thing from this misleading co.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really well made</li>
      <li>this cap is able to still encompass my whole head and keep my hair from getting wet.</li>
      <li>great shower cap , i have long hair and it really helps in keeping it completely except the tips of the hair which sometime come in contact with the ends of the cap and get wet</li>
      <li>They are snug around the face and full enough that hair is not pushed out of its styling.  </li>
      <li>Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to search for a particular size.  </li>
      <li>Had a hard time finding a nice shower cap.</li>
      <li>I could tell it would fit much closer, than the much larger Blue Dot shower cap.  </li>
      <li>Nice and big to cover my whole head/hair when my hair is up in a messy bun!</li>
      <li>I have used it maybe 8 times now, which I know isn&#x27;t a lot, but it is still as if it were brand new.  </li>
      <li>However, the package states X-Large size, but it seems to be more on the small side.</li>
      <li>Otherwise a pretty cap for simple purposes like hot oil treatments or deep conditioning sessions.</li>
      <li>so i expected the bag part to be a little larger, but other than that it works great and is a thicker cap!</li>
      <li>I have really long hair, so when I&#x27;d pin it up a regular shower cap wouldn&#x27;t quite fit over my head.</li>
      <li>The extra large blue dot shower cap is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I guess that can be considered a win, but I was kind of looking for something a little thicker, because my hair is extremely long and thick and is too heavy for these flimsy disposable ones.</li>
      <li>Instead I got a pack of 30 clear, disposable ones.</li>
      <li>Cap is as described but know that the plastic is clear and see/through not opaque as depicted in the picture.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair dry and it serves its purpose pretty well</li>
      <li>All in all, not nearly as good as the Betty Dain shower cap that I had purchased last year,  and wasn&#x27;t able to find this year.</li>
      <li>Seems like it will last me for some time, as long as I treat it properly and don&#x27;t take a scissors to it or anything!  ;-)</li>
      <li>The lacy elastic band keeps my hair snugly in place and dry, which is really its only job in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a nice, large shower cap (for those of us with big heads and/or lots of thick, long hair; or, in my case, both), which I had trouble finding locally in stores.</li>
      <li>I have been through quite a few caps that are cheaply made with elastic that doesn&#x27;t hold its shape, and have always ended up with damp or wet hair.</li>
      <li>Very affordable, and works extremely well at keeping your hair dry....</li>

<li> Very affordable, and works extremely well at keeping your hair dry....</li>
<li> I have long hair, there is enough room and the elastic is snug enough not to let in water.  </li>
<li> when I want to preserve a hairdo, and use the other smaller (solid color different brand) one in case</li>
<li> also sent both shower caps to my daughter and granddaughter, the larger Blue Dot one for my adult daughter who has long hair and the smaller solid one to my little toddler granddaughter, knowing of course it would be a game of trading shower caps (which I used to play with my daughter) but both are very servicable..</li>
<li> My hair go wet very shortly afterwards.</li>
<li> Not too big and looks like the design won&#x27;t come off like what happens with other shower caps.</li>
<li> Great shower cap, big enough to cover all your hair area, plastic material is thick and durable, unlike other brands that are very thin and very small in size.</li>
<li> The elastic is too loose, which defeats the purpose of the cap altogether.  </li>
<li> Use it for after GYM showers , when i not wanna wash my hair or get them wet !</li>
<li> I have long thick hair</li>
<li> This one was a waste of my money.</li>
<li> There is no better shower cap.  </li>
<li> IT was a big disappointment.</li>
<li> Loses it shape when the bathroom steams up.</li>
<li> I mean, after all it&#x27;s just a Shower Cap.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have very thick shoulder-length hair and can get it all in the cap.</li>
<li> I do have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s very thick</li>
<li> Not happy with this product.  </li>

    <li> Simple shower cap. Not too big and looks like the design won&#x27;t come off like what happens with other shower caps.</li>
    <li> Loses it shape when the bathroom steams up. My hair go wet very shortly afterwards. Otherwise a pretty cap for simple purposes like hot oil treatments or deep conditioning sessions.</li>
    <li> cap is sturdy and elastic is very good, I would prefer if the cap part was a little softer plastic, but this is fine</li>
    <li> This is great for medium to short hair.</li>

    <li> This is a nice, large shower cap (for those of us with big heads and/or lots of thick, long hair; or, in my case, both), which I had trouble finding locally in stores. The lacy elastic band keeps my hair snugly in place and dry, which is really its only job in life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: the blue dot pattern cap is not as opaque as pictured. It appears to be white, but it&#x27;s actually somewhat translucent with the blue dots. Almost like a frosty shower curtain liner. That&#x27;s not an issue for me, but just something to note. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great cap for the money.</li>
    <li> Good enough shower cap for the money. However, the package states X-Large size, but it seems to be more on the small side. Works well if you have short hair.</li>
    <li> Many hotesl no longer provide a shower cap in their bathrooms, do having these is a real necessity for me.  They are snug around the face and full enough that hair is not pushed out of its styling.  They are made well and offered at a very reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> This shower cap fits my big head with room to spare. I have very thick shoulder-length hair and can get it all in the cap. I could easily fit twice as much in there and have some room to spare. Unless you are Rapunzel, your hair should fit.</li>
    <li> This was meant for kid. It was not a L or XL as described. IT was a big disappointment. I will never&lt;br /&gt;buy anything from this site again.</li>
    <li> It is really cute, the material is okay, but is way to small to cover my hair up. I use it anyway, but I would have rather a bigger cap.</li>
    <li> This shower cap with blue pattern--- I like it. It&#x27;s cheerful looking,  and it does the job!  Quick delivery also!&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another shower cap on the same day I ordered this one,  in the same order, but a totally  different one, smaller and solid color. I could tell it would fit much closer, than the much larger Blue Dot shower cap.  I use it (Blue Dot one) when I want to preserve a hairdo, and use the other smaller (solid color different brand) one in case I decide mid-shower to pull it off last minute to shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also sent both shower caps to my daughter and granddaughter, the larger Blue Dot one for my adult daughter who has long hair and the smaller solid one to my little toddler granddaughter, knowing of course it would be a game of trading shower caps (which I used to play with my daughter) but both are very servicable.. However the Blue Dot one is MUCH larger.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair dry and it serves its purpose pretty well</li>
    <li> I have long hair, there is enough room and the elastic is snug enough not to let in water.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> great shower cap , i have long hair and it really helps in keeping it completely except the tips of the hair which sometime come in contact with the ends of the cap and get wet</li>
    <li> There is no better shower cap.  This Annie line is the only line I purchase.  And it shrinks and expands to smaller or larger heads and hair.  You don&#x27;t have to search for a particular size.  Everyone can spend their shower cap dollar on the same Annie product.</li>
    <li> Nice size and works well forms.  Had a hard time finding a nice shower cap.</li>
    <li> At last a good quality shower cap that fits snugly over my head and keeps the water out. I have been through quite a few caps that are cheaply made with elastic that doesn&#x27;t hold its shape, and have always ended up with damp or wet hair. This one feels to be of a high quality, and the fit is great. Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, this great shower cap is a big help for a quick shower before I go out. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I shower with my hair up, and there is enough space in that cap for any hair style. My best shower cap ever.</li>
    <li> (using my husband&#x27;s account on here) Does what it is supposed to do. Use it for after GYM showers , when i not wanna wash my hair or get them wet !</li>
    <li> This is the only shower cap you&#x27;ll ever need.  Yes, you can get fancier, and yes, you can pay a whole lot more.  The size is ample, the tightness is perfect, and there&#x27;s lace around the edge.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome and long lasting. Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> I mean, after all it&#x27;s just a Shower Cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adjust perfectly to my head and no water gets in my hair.</li>
    <li> Nice and big to cover my whole head/hair when my hair is up in a messy bun!</li>
    <li> Good product. Very comfortable and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I am in a talent show. I am singing &amp;#34;Splish Splash&amp;#34; and will use the shower cap in my act. It is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Good quality...fit that big hairdo of my wife&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Great shower cap, big enough to cover all your hair area, plastic material is thick and durable, unlike other brands that are very thin and very small in size. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product.  The elastic is too loose, which defeats the purpose of the cap altogether.  The vinyl seems to be fair, which is why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1. All in all, not nearly as good as the Betty Dain shower cap that I had purchased last year,  and wasn&#x27;t able to find this year. I purchased this one as a substitute for,  and found the product to not be comparable. . This one was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Just your standard shower cap with good, comfortable elastic. Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
    <li> Very affordable, and works extremely well at keeping your hair dry.... the only thing a shower cap is required to do!</li>
    <li> The cap was for my elderly mother, and it is perfect. It fits well and protects her hair from the shower. Plus, it is very pretty.</li>
    <li> This shower cap is just what I needed. It&#x27;s really well made and it keeps my hair securely in place when I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair, so when I&#x27;d pin it up a regular shower cap wouldn&#x27;t quite fit over my head. This one&#x27;s great - it has plenty of room, a good elastic, and none of that terry lining, which i just think is pointless.</li>
    <li> Unless I misread the product details, I was supposed to be getting a blue polka dot shower cap. Instead I got a pack of 30 clear, disposable ones. I guess that can be considered a win, but I was kind of looking for something a little thicker, because my hair is extremely long and thick and is too heavy for these flimsy disposable ones.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and she loves it, and plans to buy more in the future. It works fine.</li>
    <li> The extra large blue dot shower cap is exactly what I needed. I have long thick hair and when I put it in a bun this cap is able to still encompass my whole head and keep my hair from getting wet.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time. It is as described in the website. The product is ideal for showers. The material is durable and does not wear out easily when used. I like it !</li>
    <li> Works great Love how it is tight fitted. I do have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s very thick so i expected the bag part to be a little larger, but other than that it works great and is a thicker cap!</li>
    <li> Everything you need in a shower cap including a great fit.</li>
    <li> This arrived i never opened it especially since it was x tea Large won&#x27;t order any thing from this misleading co.</li>
    <li> Cap is as described but know that the plastic is clear and see/through not opaque as depicted in the picture.</li>
