<li> I bought this for my wife (who has very course and dry african hair) and decided to try it myself.</li>
<li> I was really going crazy, to the point that I pretty much bought a different variation of product every time I went to the store.</li>
<li> after the first use i had much less dry scalp than usual, and after the second use my scalp has no flakes at all.</li>
<li> , does not leave my hair dry or frizzy, doesn&#x27;t affect my hair color, and it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t say that this product makes my hair grow faster than any other shampoo or conditioner that I have used on a regular basis.  </li>
<li> I have had dry flaky scalp for years and no shampoo i have ever tried worked.</li>
<li> I am white so this is not just for black people.</li>
<li> Also, this product has a menthol scent that reminds me of cough drops and chest rub, but the scent only lasts for a few minutes after the product has been rinsed out of the hair.</li>
<li> I washed my hair a few weeks after the perm as I usually do and my hair got completely tangled up.</li>
<li> This new formula is weak and did not tingle.  </li>
<li> It used to work wonders on my hair and now its just like any other shampoo I&#x27;ve been trying, IDK if its my hair or what</li>
<li> The quantity is too little compared to the one that I usually bought  in store at the same price.</li>
<li> It was a mess.</li>
<li> Then after using this stuff for a few days..</li>
<li> Does this mean it&#x27;s really not working?  </li>
<li> I was at my wits&#x27; end, having tried product after product, from drugstore, organic, and salon treatments and shampoos to EXPENSIVE prescription steroids and shampoos, etc., over several years!</li>
<li> It was hard to comb and hard to rinse out.</li>
<li> And I do mean..</li>
<li> Either it would just help get rid of the itch or it would make the flaking worse.</li>
<li> I have tried a lot of dandruff shampoo with disappointing results.</li>
<li> even worse!!</li>
<li> but it leaves this weird texture that I truly hate.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s a very expensive  dandruff shampoo.</li>
<li> The shampoo is also drying which is bad news for my hair but may work well for people with finer tresses.</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>

    <li> The makers of this shampoo/conditioner market it as a product that will make hair grow faster.  I can&#x27;t say that this product makes my hair grow faster than any other shampoo or conditioner that I have used on a regular basis.  However, this is a great shampoo if you suffer from dandruff or dry scalp. I generally wash my hair daily, but if I go a couple of days without washing my hair, I tend to get dry scalp in which case the tingling sensation feels very good.  Also, this product has a menthol scent that reminds me of cough drops and chest rub, but the scent only lasts for a few minutes after the product has been rinsed out of the hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Love love love love love love it. I can not seem to stop washing my hair, and the appearance of my hair after I apply the conditioner is superb.</li>
    <li> This 2 in 1 smells wonderful though the size is small and I don&#x27;t notice the tingling sensation.  The shampoo is also drying which is bad news for my hair but may work well for people with finer tresses.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo as a hair grower. It has a strong smell but it gets the job done for hair growth.</li>
    <li> I always had severe dandruff problem every since I was a child so severe that I had scabs of dandruff in my scalp. I&#x27;M now in my 40&#x27;s. I have tried a lot of dandruff shampoo with disappointing results.I saw this shampoo on the shelf, after looking at the price I was like that&#x27;s a very expensive  dandruff shampoo. Guess what? It really works. I can go 8 days straight without a itch or a flake. Spend the money you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> The product was ok. I didn&#x27;t feel the tingle it claimed I was gonna fill but it did the job. It was ok.</li>
    <li> It works better than anything I&#x27;ve tired for dandruff.  Nice clean minty scent &amp; my scalp feels clean--no more itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> I bought this from online because I couldn&#x27;t find the original version in the stores near me. The product is good, however I went to another area and found the original (not the dandruff version) in a local beauty store. I feel the original version helps my hair grow better than the dandruff one. But overall it&#x27;s still good.</li>
    <li> Cleans good smell good</li>
    <li> I have purchased Dr. Miracles&#x27;s shampoo with tingle for the last 4 or more years and it has really helped in times past.  This new formula is weak and did not tingle.  I shampooed with it 3 times and not a tingle at all.  Does this mean it&#x27;s really not working?  After use I had bumps in my head as though I have allergy to it.  Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> It used to work wonders on my hair and now its just like any other shampoo I&#x27;ve been trying, IDK if its my hair or what but it leaves this weird texture that I truly hate. It doesn&#x27;t even tingle after the 2nd use. I will not buy this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I have Seborrheic Dermatitis and have used just about EVERY product that is out there, including prescribed shampoos, to help get rid of the severe itch and flaking I get. Nothing worked! Either it would just help get rid of the itch or it would make the flaking worse. I actually stumbled upon this stuff on accident and I tell you what....I REGRET NOTHING! The first time I used this it felt soooo good. It tingled and was cool on my scalp, which was great because it relieved the itching. The smell was fantastic and is surprisingly relaxing. I noticed that the flaking was much better. Then after using this stuff for a few days..THE FLAKING WAS GONE!! The itch was gone, the flaking was gone and my hair felt and smelled fantastic. I HIGHLY recommend this tuff to anyone who has itch or flaking problems. This is the only shampoo I will ever use from here on out.</li>
    <li> I was at my wits&#x27; end, having tried product after product, from drugstore, organic, and salon treatments and shampoos to EXPENSIVE prescription steroids and shampoos, etc., over several years! I was really going crazy, to the point that I pretty much bought a different variation of product every time I went to the store. THIS is the ONLY product that has made my itching, flaking, embarrassing dandruff/seborrhea/whatever go away. And I do mean..IT IS GONE. Just amazing. Tears of joy. Besides that, it smells good, lathers really well, does not leave my hair dry or frizzy, doesn&#x27;t affect my hair color, and it lasts a long time. If I could kiss Dr. Miracle, I would.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the smell and it really does tingle. Leaves my hair smelling good and feeling great!</li>
    <li> I totally don&#x27;t feel the tingling in this dandruff shampoo its just OK for me</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the Gro Oil and Super Relaxer. The relaxer worked wonderfully and the Gro Oil leaves my hair so soft - so I couldn&#x60;t wait to try the shampoo and conditioner. It was a mess. My hair was completely soft and shiny. I washed my hair a few weeks after the perm as I usually do and my hair got completely tangled up. It was hard to comb and hard to rinse out. I had to go back over my hair with my normal shampoo and conditioner. I wish I could get my money back. Do not buy this stuff. I love the Dr Miracles brand so far - but NOT this item.</li>
    <li> I have had dry flaky scalp for years and no shampoo i have ever tried worked. I am white so this is not just for black people. I bought this for my wife (who has very course and dry african hair) and decided to try it myself. after the first use i had much less dry scalp than usual, and after the second use my scalp has no flakes at all. after years of wasting money on all kinds of different kinds of shampoo (anti-dandruff, organic, shampoo bars, conditioners, etc.) I can happily say I found one that works.</li>
    <li> The quantity is too little compared to the one that I usually bought  in store at the same price. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this product online. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> this is good shampoo. my hair is total clear. i just need routine use it every 2 days. i will recomended for scalp hair this is will be good choice.</li>
    <li> It seems to do all they claim it does. I will probably buy more of their products. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I will update my post in a month. However, there is significant difference with my scalp. I can now go a week without washing hair. Huge improvement!</li>
    <li> this was the wrong product i wanted the hair growth product from doctor miracles, but this product smells good and is soft on my hair swell.</li>
    <li> As an AA female, I have long ,course hair, which is also very dry/itchy!! I recently had my hair dyed, now it&lt;br /&gt;itches even worse!! I purchased more of this shampoo and mixed it w/some peppermint/tea tree oil...what can&lt;br /&gt;I say, \\&quot;ah relief\\&quot;!! I pray, they never stop selling this product!! Note: I also LOVE Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;products, it makes the hair soft/silky!!</li>
    <li> I am currently stretching my relaxer, so I needed a shampoo/conditioner that would get my hair clean. This works wonders!!!!! I have mild dandruff from dry scalp. So, this product got my hair CLEAN!!!!! I also purchased the Dr. Miracles follicle healer deep conditioning treatment in the orange and tan colored packet. This system worked wonders on my hair!! Loveee it!! I also love the peppermint smell too!</li>
    <li> I Love the dr. Miracle products, they seem to work just the way they say they do. I  loved the fast shipping, really great product</li>
