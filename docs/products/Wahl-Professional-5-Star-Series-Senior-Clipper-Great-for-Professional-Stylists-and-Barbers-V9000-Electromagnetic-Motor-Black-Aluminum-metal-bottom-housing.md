<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these clippers. This was my first set of clippers that I bought and If something bad ever happens I&#x27;ll come back and by another set. I cut my hair with these every week. I love the sound of em, the weight, the looks and the cut. I recommend these to everyone cutting hair. I cant think of one thing negative to say about them. Wahl keep doing your thing.</li>
    <li> Need this as I&#x27;m a busy hairstylist.  Close and clean haircuts.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers, use them with andis T outliner, the fades come out sharp!</li>
    <li> The efficiency of these clippers make for a fast, and detailed cut.  They put my $30 old ones to shame. They get a little warm after 20 minutes, but not enough that it outweighs the benefits of it&#x27;s performance capabilities.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers are a long debate. I wanted to cut my own hair, but didn&#x27;t know what clippers I should buy. These clippers cut very well, and cut like a charm. I&#x27;m happy I bought them and I always get good results.</li>
    <li> HI JUST BOUGHT THIS CLIPPER ON E BAY UNFORTUNATELY YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USED OUTSIDE OF USA:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST HAVE A LOW TRANSFORMER AS THE CLIPPER USED ONLY 12 WATS AND ALSO THE FREQUENCY IN USA IS 60MZ IN EUROPE IS 50MZ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STANDARD TRANSFORMER WORK AT 45 WATTS UPWARDS YOU CAN FIND A LOWER ONE MAYBE BUT IT WILL COST YOU 10 TIMES MORE THAN WHAT YOU PAY FOR THE CLIPPER ALSO THE FREQUENCY WILL HAVE TO BE CONVERTER TOO OTHERWISE YOUR CLIPPER WILL GO TOO FAST AND TOO NOISY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CLIPPER IS NICE ONE BUT DESIGNED JUST FOR USA</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the difference from this and the Desinger clipper besides the color. I have yet to use them, but I&#x27;m sure they will work just fine.</li>
    <li> I already own the Whal Seniors so I wanted to see the Difference between the whal seniors and the Whal Five Star seniors. Ther both great Clippers Only difference I found was that the five stars blades are thiner that the regualr seniors. but both great clippers which ever you decided to get.</li>
    <li> Wahl is an outstanding trimmer if you get a Wahl Pro or better. The ones in Target and Walmart are a joke compared to this unit.</li>
    <li> I have 4 boys +my hubby and these are great. They do not get hot easily, a real plus. Make sure you oil them often, or they get dull and sticky. Very happy after 10 months and approximately. 20+ hair cuts😄</li>
    <li> Clippers came in box but appeared to be used once or more before. Blade was not straight and slightly crooked. Metal piece also had some slight damage to it with some dents on it. Then metal also had a bunch of finger prints. This was definitely not new and when I ordered it, it stated it was new. I am returning this and ordering another one. Hopefully this time it is new.</li>
    <li> Love it, smooth motor</li>
    <li> very good product &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; shipping was good! can&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> I have tried the other brands. They simply do not work very well. This is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> did a very diligent survey on which clipperss to buy, these were the best rated by barbers! I am very happy and satisfied with my choice! i am a barber and i do a lot of close fades and bald fades, these clippers are great for fading. they will cut the clients head if you are not careful!! howerver the blades were screwed on &amp;#34;very crooked&amp;#34; stright out of the box, i got a good friend to take them off aand put them back on straight.</li>
    <li> You must know a little about barbering when getting this, the blade is extreamly flat and sharp. It does tend to heat up but only if you are taking 30 min + with no pauses.</li>
    <li> This cliper get hot  after two hair cut!</li>
    <li> Excellent clipper.  Nice sharp, crisp cut.  My 2nd Wahl - 1st one is about 10 years old and still works.  Only reason I bought this one was I dropped the old Wahl for about the 10th time and the side adjuster broke.  I fully expect this one to last just as long, if not longer.  Does run warm but nothing that&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Great...shipped as promised.arrived ahead of time in perfect condition.. great product. great cuts.</li>
    <li> i made a mistake when i bought these because i looked at the reviews and not the description. in the reviews people talk about the v9000 and so i bought it. when i went to track my package i came back and looked and the description said v5000 and i was so pissed cuz i wanted the v9000. then i read threw the reviews and someone said the description was wrong and sure enough he was right! i just recieved them 10 minutes ago and sure enough its the v9000 model it says so right on the box :) so i just want to confirm this for anyone looking to buy these or already has bought these and is now freaking out like i was lol. sleep easy it is the v9000</li>
    <li> 1) if the description was correct, I would have purchased this clipper from the seller above -- this clipper is the v9000 shunt motor, not v5000.  below is the review of this clipper from a different seller (still on amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these clippers because I started cutting my kids hair -- i have an older pair of wahl clippers that were good for me, not for my kids.  my kids move around a lot and also have more hair then their bald father -- the old clippers seemed to pull their hair and we had to go over the same spot multiple times.  so, i bought these clippers to shave my head but also cut my kids hair too.  i did a lot of research and ultimately did not want to spend $120 on the oster 76. i also did not want to get a balding clipper -- i wanted something to do both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these clippers went through my kids hair with ease.  powerful, pretty quite  and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i purchased the Wahl Professional 2 Hole Balding Clipper Blade 2105 from amazon -- i put these on the clippers and, after a little bit of calibrating -- gave myself the closest buzz of my life -- of course, i&#x27;m not sure if they were intended to go on the clippers, but for $10, the attachment was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have only given myself and kids 1 haircut each.  at this point, i am very please with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Not many frills to this , just a great, quiet, powerful clipper that cuts like crazy. Lots of oil to last years. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a barber for over 19 years now and these are excellent clippers.  Yes they do get warm, but only if you are taking forever on a particular cut.  I use them over and over all day long and never have a problem.  Very strong durable clippers.  I&#x27;ve owned 3 pairs over the years and never had a problem.  You can adjust the blade depending on how close you want the cut.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> These clippers came to me in a well packaged box and everything looked great upon arrival. I bought these for cutting hair at home and after cutting my brothers hair I was incredibly impressed. We usually use the $20 at home clipper kits from Wal-Mart and although they got the job done, this clipper really was fantastic for the fade he was looking for. The blades are incredibly sharp and the prescision is on point. You can get so close to the skin, way better then anything I have used before. These were recommended to me by a professional barber. They are no joke. These clippers are wonderful.</li>
    <li> i have not tried the clipper yet, and it arrived quick, but please fix the description for newer buyers. this is in fact the v9000 and comes with 3 clips. because of this i double checked and come to find out description says its the older model, I ordered a separate clipper thinking it was a mistake. but it arrives and its actually the newer model. so now i have to spend all this extra time trying to fix things out with a seller through amazon.</li>
    <li> I actually bought it to buzz my beard. I&#x27;ve been using it for that this whole time and it works great. No pain, buzzes the hair right off. I had folks go cheapo on me and buy pieces of crap which ripped my hair and hurt. This one was definitely not a cheap piece of crap</li>
    <li> These clippers are great for a do it at home haircut or for an expierenced  stylist  it doesn&#x27;t  get any better. I also baught the Wahl 8-pack color coded cutting guides with organizer so I&#x27;m set</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance for Valentine&#x27;s Day he loved it he&#x27;s a barber he jumped for joy practically throwing me in the air like a kid great product</li>
    <li> The best pair of clippers i&#x27;ve owned so far</li>
    <li> I am not a Barber, I have been cutting my own hair for years now and this clipper does great with Balding and Fading. I use this with my other clippers to give myself a quality cut that others will be envious of.</li>
    <li> As I write this review I have blood dripping off the side of my head from using this clipper.  The ends of the blades are extremely sharp so when they encounter a bump on your head they just shear it off.  This is the third time I have shaved off bumps from my head using this shear.  Never had this problem before with other shears.  Wife not happy throwing away blood stained pillow cases as well...</li>
    <li> one of the best electric razors yet.</li>
    <li> this thing is a beast the only problems are that its the vibrations pretty heavy and that you have to keep it away from water and you have to clean it often which wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal if cleaning didn&#x27;t require taking the blade off.  the issue is that you can&#x27;t get the blades straight just by screwing them back on because the holes on the blade are larger than they need to be. this allows you to make the blades flush but takes lots of time making sure they are straight.  this is the number one flaw in my  non expert opinion. however I&#x27;m sure they make a blade or some type of metal ring that could fix this problem so i am looking for that and i will update i find anything</li>
    <li> This clipper is by most the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever own. I would fully recommend this clipper to your clipper arsenals. Mines has da v9000 and dat sucka runs cherry n no ova heat.</li>
    <li> the clipper when received you can feel the quality in this clipper but its cons over rule its pros&lt;br /&gt;pros: cuts fast&lt;br /&gt;  okay blend&lt;br /&gt;cons: heats up fast&lt;br /&gt;  heavy ( but not as heavy as the masters)&lt;br /&gt;  blend is OKAY</li>
    <li> IVE BEEN CUTTING HAIR AND MY OWN HAIR FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS NOW AND BY FAR THESE ARE THE BEST CLIPPERS IVE EVER USED. ALONG WITH THE 5 STAR RAZOR/EDGE THATS ALL I NEED FOR ALL MY FADES AND LINE UPS . HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO BUY.</li>
    <li> I already have a Wahl Senior, but wanted to try the v9000 motor so I ordered these.&lt;br /&gt;The power is amazing. It also \\&quot;opens\\&quot; much more than any other Whal. The fade blade was kinda pulling on my beard area, so I took it out and put a regular blade in.&lt;br /&gt;Im now selling my grey Senior. All Wahl has to do now is fix their attachments.</li>
    <li> Impressive machine but you need to buy guards for it</li>
    <li> This is a quality clipper, and will undoubtedly provide lots of &amp;#34;miles&amp;#34; for the haircuts at our house.  It has sturdy construction and well-fitting variety of hair length attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have paid an extra $10 for a sturdy case with it (as it comes only in a cardboard box).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair since 13 and I have to say, these are the smoothest cutting clippers I&#x27;ve ever had.  Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just list some basics:&lt;br /&gt;Quality...Professional. Anyone who cuts hair knows wahl.  Good cord too.&lt;br /&gt;Sharpness...Very sharp. Adjust blade. Take your time for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Weight ..Average to any other&lt;br /&gt;Heat...It did get hot after about an hour of use.  But I believe anything would after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping...I received it in new condition and secure.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about these clippers! They are powerful and sharp. That being said these clippers are not for a novice. They will draw blood and cause razor burn</li>
    <li> This unit is awesome. It gives me the cuts I love and is very easy to use. The name says it all 5 Star.</li>
    <li> Still heavier than the Andis, but a great fell while holding. I&#x27;f you Zero Gap the blades it will NOT leave and lines in your fades or tapers. And for a metal casing, it doesnt get as hot as the Andis does when cutting for long periods of times.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts hair 20yrs now she said best in the biz for this app.</li>
    <li> I just bought one of these clippers.  It gets very HOT.  The \\&quot;cool running\\&quot; description is wrong.  This isn&#x27;t any better than the cheaper Wahl adjustable clippers.  I paid too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve tried other clipper brands over the years. Wahl clippers are the only clippers I use.  They are the best.  But this one being advertised as cool running is false advertisement.</li>
    <li> Got my clipper on time, but when opening the package I discovered that it was missing the 3 combs that come included :/ ...  It&#x27;s a very powerful product and would recommend it. The description says it&#x27;s the V-5000 but it&#x27;s actually the V-9000, just like the rest of the comments below. Overall it&#x27;s a great clipper and very satisfied with the product but it lost my 5 star rating due to the missing combs..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay successful my people!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months now and I love it. I bought this clipper because I wanted to start cutting my own hair. Very strong motor clipper that never catches my hair and it&#x27;s very easy to do my tapers with. Anybody looking for some good quality clippers I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The best pair of clippers i have ever owned. I love the way it comes with a 1.5 blade, which makes my blend from a 2 to 1 almost too easy! I recommend adding the Wahl 8-pack color coded cutting guides with organizer as well!</li>
    <li> Came on time blades where not aligned straight but adjusting them is easy it&#x27;s not loud but it does get hot pretty fast and it cuts really good</li>
    <li> I love my Wahl Seniors... they&#x27;re very powerful and precise and they dont get as hot as the Andis Master.</li>
    <li> Good clippers. They run a little hot to me but good otherwise. They cut through thick hair like hot knife through butter</li>
    <li> I have a masters but needed a second one because sometimes my andis gets too hot. Great clipper although I had to zero gap it as there was a huge gap from factory</li>
    <li> Love this clipper i have 4 pair 2 at my station and 2 foe my Mobil set up these are top of the line must have</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE  MUY  BUENA  ATENCI&amp;Oacute;N  Y  EL ARTICULO DE BUENA CALIDAD LOS RECOMIENDO :D PUNTUAL TODO BIEN RESPONSABLE  Y Y Y</li>
    <li> very smooth cutting, not too noisy, love the color. totally a good buy for my money!!!!!! I am totally in love with it!!</li>
    <li> I cut my brothers hair with this machine it works well! I love it</li>
    <li> First time cutting my own head ever and these were great. Accompanied by a mirror. I was able to taper my hair with these.. I&#x27;m african american lol, So I don&#x27;t know if you know what a taper is... but basically it&#x27;s a fade.. to the sideburns and back of your head. and these worked great for that. The whole set that came with these clippers were all you need.</li>
    <li> Bought these because I got tired of not having strong enough clippers to cut my hair because old clippers used to tug on my hair.These clippers are strong enough and EXTREMELY SHARP I tried to shave my chest with them and cut myself to the white meat these things cut real close so be careful.Im glad I purchased them though they seem sturdy and well made also</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper under the impression that it was a new product. but it has CLEARLY been used. It&#x27;s covered in finger smudges, oil, and hair.  This was not advertised as a used product. Will be returning ASAP.</li>
    <li> Do NOT Buy.  I repeat Do NOT buy!!  This product is not new.  Once you get the product you will either find oil already on the blade.  And when you unscrew the blades to adjust them you will find hair underneath.  Absolutely disgusting.  Someone in quality control needs to be fired.</li>
    <li> Let me start here. If you&#x27;re a barber / cosmetologist &amp; you only trust your local beauty store. This is when to stop. I only trusted the stores and not online. But Once I ordered this machine it came in very quick. In 3 days. It is brand new and very good machine for fades &amp; to take down bulkiness. You will NOT regret buying this machine</li>
    <li> I needed a second pair I already own the sterling reflections which are my favorite and these are the same in black btw you need to adjust the blades no matter how they come watch YouTube how to i swear if you dont know clippers dont be posting negative comments your . opinion doesnt matter</li>
    <li> very nice clippers best out there</li>
    <li> Every barber should have one oc these</li>
    <li> I love this adjustable clipper! They do get hot after a while. I wish they made the grip for a left handed person.  Overall I love these great for tapering and fading</li>
    <li> Hi, I have a question,  I bought this clipper but came with a different color in the image published</li>
    <li> I ordered with the expectations of being new as advertised. They were used. Blades were not aligned and had paint missing on the body. Lots of scratches as well. Sent a replacement with same issue. I kept them since I needed clippers right away. Worked fine at first. Then I started having issues. They lasted about 2 months. I will buy from a supply store or dealer from now on.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> When i received it the blade was not adjusted it was crooked so when i adjusted it the blade was too far to the left and it did not work properly. Also, it gets hot super fast this is the second item that i buy from Amazon that i get defective that&#x27;s why now i hesitate before buying something here</li>
    <li> I have a pair of wahl seniors that have been with me for 13 years, they have been great and are still going strong. I decided to get these 5 star seniors because of the fading blade and the upgraded motor they have. I hope I can get the same service out of these as I have with my original seniors.</li>
    <li> Great clippers but didn&#x27;t last no more than a month. It got very hot fast within 30 minutes. I stopped using them and purchased the andis master clippers.</li>
    <li> Have used the regular wahl for years but I could see and feel the difference in this pro version. Smooth shave and cut. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Received my clippers with hair still stuck inside of them, missing a lot of items that were supposed to be in box. Clippers we&#x27;re just thrown in box with nothing holding them inside. Clippers had scratches all over them aswell.</li>
    <li> At first I did not know what to expect with the Wahl clippers since my last one was an Andis brand clipper, but after I tested them out I felt that they were simply great. If your wondering how well they fade I would give them a 10 out of 10. They come with everything it says and are brand new. The price was very satisfying in comparison to that of the beauty supplies places. Overall great item recommended to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I hope this is the beginning of a long term relationship!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only note I would make is that it only comes with very short clipper comb attachments.  Because I had not purchased an additional kit of combs I had to buzz my hair super short instead of just short.</li>
    <li> The receiver of this gift said it was the best clipper he had ever used! use on his short hair and beard.</li>
    <li> Heavy. Clips close enough to cut your scalp. Can&#x27;t use it to shave my head or beard. Don&#x27;t get one if you use anticoagulants, not kidding.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Use it in a high volume professional salon and it cuts beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not come with a complete guard set, fyi.</li>
    <li> Purchased for My Son who is a Master Barber and swears by this product</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s hair is slightly coarser than mine, at least at this age, so getting a powerful set of clippers beyond my normal Wahl home clippers was a must and I remember the first time I used them.  Went through his hair like butta.  So happy.</li>
    <li> Love this thing. I bought it as a beard trimmer as I have really corse facial hair and the standard house trimmers just wouldn&#x27;t cut it, literally. I would recommended for facial or haircut use.</li>
    <li> My clippers arrived with misaligned blades and the sharpening of the blades doesn&#x27;t seem to be even. I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s at fault the company I got it from or the shipping company. If you read this review and could help me out with the two problems I mentioned above. I&#x27;d appreciate it.</li>
    <li> Wahl 5star clippers work great! Their perfect for taper cuts. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am a barber and I use a pair of these every day that I work. They are great. Heavy-duty, and reliable.</li>
    <li> too hot just for one hair cut. now i&#x27;m going exchange another one, let&#x27;s see what happen.</li>
    <li> Great clippers for the price</li>
    <li> It is my first set of Clippers and I have even though I dont know much about what I am doing. They are working very well and will continue enjoy learning as I go. Great clippers. They do warm up pretty quickly and as I mentioned I wouldnt know if this is bad, but I do stop and wait a little for them to cool down.</li>
    <li> send a return label im used to shopping on ebay i tried to make a change but i am offended by your returns. i will have to pay for a return label because i was sent the wrong old used thing? this would never go with ebay i guess it was my mistake for changing</li>
    <li> I think these are the best fading clippers out on the market after, of course, the Andis Master.  However, the Andis Master costs a fortune, and they get hot very quickly.  The 5-Star Senior does not get hot fast, and the fade blade cuts excellently!  I will only buy Wahl clippers now because they run coolly, cut fades extremely well, and are the most reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl really hit it out of the park with these.  They are very durable clippers, and the V9000 motor is very powerful, yet cool.  These are hands down the best Wahl clippers at this point in time.</li>
    <li> good machine for the price</li>
    <li> I bought these because I wanted them with the v9000 motor. Definitely a noticeable upgrade from v5000. Clippers do not get hot. Normally I use 2 to 3 pairs of clippers when cutting my hair. It is not necessary with these. I have the Seniors with the v5000 and they get hot after 30min of operation. The guards included are an upgrade over the previous versions. The 1/2 guard is perfect. Good decent clipper worth the money.....</li>
    <li> Foremost, I am not a barber.  I bought this product for my use but by someone else,  the barber. My barber finds himself spoiled by using this machine and rates it as &amp;#34;great great. It is fantastic man&amp;#34;.  I bought this machine with the intent of taking with me for my personal use when traveling abroad.  In my professional life I have been exposed to some cases from abroad that still make me squint.  So trying to minimize opportunities of exposure to some of those situations,  I bought my own clipper and attachments.  I am not a barber but I have cleaned up my sideburns to at least hold until time permits to get on the chair. I have tried other machines and this one by the feel of it performes pretty smoothly,  powerful.  From my homework before buying and my limited experience, I would buy it again should need be.</li>
    <li> Cuts like butter compared to my Designers. I will say that these clippers might but too much for someone new to cutting hair professionally. I work at SportClips and run my clippers all day. It survived a busy shift. My cuts were great and my clients noticed the difference!!</li>
    <li> I had previously owned a couple pairs of Oster clippers, and these Wahl clippers were a HUGE step up from those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty thick hair, and these clippers do not have any problems at all cutting it.  This is great because with other clippers, I would have to go over my head 7 or 8 times to make sure I did not miss any hairs, but these Wahl clippers do no have any of those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT clippers.</li>
    <li> Best clippers period!!</li>
    <li> Everything was in good shape and works properly.</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my hair for over 10 years.  I have the Oster 76 Classic and wanted to try these Seniors.  These clippers are different than my Osters but they have now been my Go To clippers.  I feel like they were able to cut hair that the Osters were not able to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good purchase if you have been cutting your hair for a while.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> i have been a barber for over 15 years and have worked with many adjustable clippers.  the one thing i love about the wahl 5 star is the fading or tapering ability of the clipper. its smooth and powerfull ,and it does pull the scalp of the client like the andis fade master.  truly a 5 star clipper.</li>
    <li> I received the 5Star Wahl Seniors v9000 Jan. 4, 2012, which was 2 days earlier than estimated. The clipper has a great sound to it, and the weight feels really good in the hand. I&#x27;m really satisfied with the product and service I&#x27;ve received. I highly recommend seller.</li>
    <li> Clipper is an excellent machine. However when I received clipper it was far from zero gapped. Blade was completely misaligned. Had to remove blade and zero gap myself.</li>
    <li> Nice set of clippers. Well built, not noisy and easy to operate.</li>
    <li> Great pair of clippers. Gets the job done on my short, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Best pair of blending clippers I own (and yes I have the Andis masters)  highly recommend these to anyone who wants to cut hair</li>
    <li> heavy duty well balanced clippers with various attachments , nice metal case long cord , that is thick , nice carry bag</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. These clipper cut so smooth and they have made my fades look even better. I highly suggest getting them. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a much better product than the Wahl 79524-2501 Chrome Pro 24-Piece Haircut Kit and the&lt;br /&gt;Wahl 84900 Icon Clipper. I only have two issues. First, it only comes with three guides, which is clearly stated in the product description. However, every other clipper I&#x27;ve purchased in the past came with 8-10 guides. The second issue I have is it doesn&#x27;t come with a case/bag, which must be purchased separately. It comes in a cardboard box which I simply discarded.</li>
    <li> Not sure how the product is. I received a used or repackaged shipment, not new. Returned!</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed to groom my pups. I am please with the safe of this product as well</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome product, highly recomend it .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like Wahl put a team of mechanical engineers on the clipper design and then had the intern design the guards.  There clippers catch hair between the stationary blade teeth and the plastic guards.  I might be able to modify them a little, but damn it hurts when they catch!  I paid good money so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to fix this.. The clippers themselves do look and feel very solid, like they will last a long time though.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product and the incorrect product arrived I was extremely upset due that it&#x27;s the first time it happened and I was put in a jam due to it. It shows as a wahl 5 star equipped with the v9000 motor and that&#x27;s not what came In The box. Horrible. look at the picture of the item i purchased, and look at the picture of the item i received. Definitely not the same someone is scamming customers. I don&#x27;t recommend that anyone purchases this product.</li>
    <li> We had a pair of the Wahl trimmers that were around $25 bucks at Walmart. Every time I cut my husband&#x27;s hair, I had to go over and over it numerous times or there would be lots of stray hairs that didn&#x27;t get cut. These are a real improvement. It gets all the hairs the first time over, and it doesn&#x27;t leave those weird lines that you can get with the cheaper ones if you aren&#x27;t careful. Worth the extra money!</li>
    <li> I wanted a set of clipper that was reliable and could do the job of cutting hair. This is it they work well and do a fantastic job. Cutting this hair isn&#x27;t easy, but no problem with these clippers . I love them an d the price was reasonable also. Love them</li>
    <li> Ended up paying for a new one but got mine in the mail and it had a few scratches and I checked the outlet and saw that it was already scratched from use. Also saw black smudges which could be hair. Also I believe they had sent me a returned one because my clippers had the issues of pulling hair with the first use. Whether trying to cut fast or slow it kept pulling.</li>
    <li> Thank you very good vendor and product.</li>
    <li> I talked to few barbers before deciding on this clipper.  I&#x27;m an african-american male.. and its important that these clippers are made to cut my hair type and are able to bald my head without overheating or damaging my bare skin.  Every barber recommended these.. and considered them their bread &amp; butter clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought plenty of Wahls from Target &amp; Walmart before.  They are not in the same league as this one.  This clipper feels like a tool and makes those clippers seem like toys.  Chances are I&#x27;ll be using this clipper (or a model just like it) for the rest of my life.  It cuts quick, cool and doesnt make too much noise.  The blade is also angled so that cutting motion is smoother and you dont end up nicking yourself.</li>
    <li> These are decent clippers but do not give me a super clean cut... I find myself having to go back over heads with my masters to get a nice finish. Spend another 20 and get masters!</li>
    <li> Very sharp and powerful clippers. Vibrates too much and too loud but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I got these clippers because I was tired of the Andis Fade Masters pulling and biting my scalp. These were among the recommendations for fading hair. I do not have these blades zero gapped but they do create nice fades. Since I don&#x27;t have these zero gapped I use my line up trimmers to take out the bottom line when doing bald fades. I am not a barber and only cut my hair so I wanted something that would be comfortable in the hand, especially when doing my neck tapers--and these clippers are very comfortable in the hand. The clippers start to heat up after about 20-30 minutes but not to the point they&#x27;re burning up and you have to put them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only grip about these clippers are that while they are not super loud they are loud enough where I can&#x27;t really hear the hair being cut. Overall though, I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> Just got mine in and they look great thnaks love the v9000 motor and does not get heat up fast love it tho</li>
    <li> The go-to clipper for experienced barbers. Don&#x27;t start off with this clipper! Buy the standard Senior with the taper blade if you are just starting out. You WILL cut a client with this blade if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing. I prefer Seniors over Andis Masters any day off the week.</li>
    <li> Get the job done,  nothing flashy.</li>
    <li> A very good clippers i bought one and is very faster to cut!! Satisfied!</li>
    <li> These are the truth. Nice for blending. Get a little warm after repetitive use in the shop,  but they are definitely a great addition to the arsenal.</li>
    <li> It was shipped to me unoperational.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after using it for 1 month. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Received the Wahl 5-Star clippers super fast and wrapped securely. It was a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it. They&#x27;re a currently transforming his clients! Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> broke shortly after first few uses</li>
    <li> Great secondary clipper ! I use an Andis Fade Master as my main clipper and this one as my fillers to go in between guards. Works great and makes my cuts easier and faster !!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer hair, use primarily to shave all body hair and pubic hair, I recommend it for men and women, leave the extremely short hair, almost looks like you waxed (is not the same, but almost), but without side effects of redness, itching, etc. The price is expensive, but for what you pay is what you get.</li>
    <li> Great clipper the only thing that bothers me though is that the 1/16 guard tends to pull hair,other than that it cuts hair really smooth and it&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
    <li> very bad, it is just too hot while a cut is not supported on hand because you burn.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper - if and only if the blades do not rust.  Used the clipper only 2 times.  Washed and rinsed with water each time after cut, oiled.  The 3rd time rust developed on the blades.  Time in between cuts is about 3 weeks average</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Have been cutting my own hair for about 10 years now and this is the best clipper I&#x27;ve had. I cut my friends hair now too! No problems with this at all. Already paid itself off in 2 months.</li>
    <li> you rock...thanks alot pleasure doing business with you..:D I couln&#x27;t get my clippers any faster and they work great..I&#x27;m not a barber I just cut hair for fun as a hobby but clippers  like this one will make my learning expiriense way better... its sharp and haircut come out clean and best thing its not really that loud...one of the best clippers I&#x27;ve gotten so far..</li>
    <li> Excellent cutting ability for professional use! Named 5 star rated 5 star!</li>
    <li> Read a lot of reviews, settled on this Wahl believing it would be a high quality, easy to use clipper at a good price. I must say after 3 haircuts, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied. It is very solid, having heft, balance and an ergonomic shape. With the cutting guide attached, I gave myself a nearly perfect buzz the first time, only needing my daughter for a couple of spots in the back. (My wife balked at being my barber, but she&#x27;ll come around). It&#x27;s easy getting great results-just like mowing the grass. It&#x27;s powerful but not loud, the switch has very positive actuation, and the cord&#x27;s long enough at about 8 feet. The taper feature works very well, allowing closer trimming (up to zero overlap) around my ears and neck. The Wahl 5-Star Senior enables me to maintain my buzz-cut properly and is paying for itself quickly. Thanks, Wahl and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Work great..cut better than expected.</li>
    <li> Blades came out of line and over oiled. I aligned and cleaned them to manufacturers specs and they are snagging skin and cutting my head. Worst purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon thus far. Wish I still had the box so I could return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the guards you&#x27;ll be fine. If you want a buzz cut. Buy the cheaper version, they&#x27;ve worked fine for me for years. I thought when you spend more you get better quality. Guess not...</li>
    <li> Great clippers. I have had no problems with them. My hair is pretty thick and these cut right through it.</li>
    <li> I cut hair all day everyday and these make the cut. I use to use Andis improved master but they have become finicky and stop performing up to par easily. I also use Wahl super taper</li>
    <li> As I came to find out, if you want hair clipped, these models are too big, and smaller units does just as good a job and weight much less. It might be good for a professional hair cutter, but for personal use, it&#x27;s just too large.</li>
    <li> As far as the company who shipped it out.. id give 5 stars. Came before expected delivery date with everything it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself... not impressed at all. I have to work twice as hard to give  a great haircut. ..time is money. Unfortunately my company required Wahl.</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot different than the $13.00 Wahl you would pick up at Wal-Mart. I really can&#x27;t say this cuts any better. It also has a really loud clicking noise when it starts up, which my cheaper one does not have. Save your money and just get the cheapo one.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best bang for your buck in terms of clippers. This thing is a power-house and I would recommend it to anyone. Very nice clippers, they are not in the super-professional league but they will sure do for my own cuts as well as other family members. I had another pair of Wahl clippers which lasted about 10 years until I dropped them and the things wouldn&#x27;t turn back on. I know I could have fixed them but I choose to buy a new set. I am glad I did. In the ad it says this has a V5000 but is has a V9000 which is a lot better.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this! He has no complaints about it. In the beginning it was very loud but he figured out why and now it is a gentle buzz.</li>
    <li> After over a year of weekly use, the 5-Star Senior Clipper is still going...It was a big improvement over the budget Wahl clipper I got from Walmart; which by the way broke and were tossed in the trash long a go.  Without a guide on it, the Senior gives a very close shave without cutting your skulp.  When I&#x27;m in a hurry, I even use it to shave my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of cons.  The first is the plastic comb guides.  The quality just isn&#x27;t there and they will break after while.  And the replacement guides (which can be purchased on Amazon) are over priced, but the price is still cheaper than anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you should be aware that it does get HOT, to the point that you have to turn it off for a minute so it&#x27;ll cool down. The overheating issue is a problem if it&#x27;s on for longer than 5 minutes.  I use the Senior to cut my own hair every weak, so I&#x27;ve gotten used to the heat and can ignore it for the most part.  But it is still uncomfortable. For someone who isn&#x27;t use to the heat, I&#x27;d imagine it would be unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m  probably making the heating issue sound worse than it is.  You won&#x27;t go wrong spending the $$ on this high quality clipper.</li>
    <li> Solid build but the branding rubs off after only 3 uses, included oil is tiny not as pictured, it does not bald but it cuts a lot closer than the $20 model. If you are just using it to trim hair or just cut to a buzz, then save your money and get $20 Wahl sets sold at WM or Costco, etc.If you are interested in shaping or professional job, then this will do just fine, but like I said I wish it cut even closer. Even with the course cut it manages to catch and nick skin around ears or other imperfections. I wonder if the blade can be adjusted to cut closer because my barber uses exact same one yet his cut is a lot closer.</li>
    <li> Cuts like butter but gets HOT, really really hot very fast.  So far used it on myself and it&#x27;s sharp, great cut.  Once I use it more on my family then i&#x27;ll have a better sense for this machine.  Look forward to updates!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite clippers. Sturdy good weight. These are the same clippers you could get at Sallys or another beauty supply for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I have now used them 3 times.  I have purchased other Wahl clippers in the past and these are the best ones I have ever used.  I agree with the comment that the zero cut is not set to be exactly zero, but a little adjustment can correct it.  I am leaving mine alone because it cuts my beard to the correct length as is.  I will eventually use these clippers to cut my hair since my haircuts are very standard.  I purchased the hair clipper guide comb set and will use the set to cut my hair (once I get my spouse to do it).</li>
    <li> Perfecto !! Best investment  I&#x27;ve made in a while .. Great deal  &amp; Fast shipping, THANKS !!!</li>
    <li> Good clippers. Strong motor. Wahl clipper attachment could use some heating to bend plastic ends to stay on better. Stays fairly cool, cuts through thick hair great</li>
    <li> Nice clippers, with powerful motor, I gave it a 4star because I thought it would have had better cutting blades. I have nice texture hair , but at times feel a slight  pull while cutting with oily blades.Overall these are some solid, durable,premium clippers!! Not bad for the Buck...</li>
    <li> These are the first quality clippers I have ever bought.  Having used many home kits we decided to step up to a nicer set of clippers.  These are great.  Very quiet, easy to use, and for one hair cut they stay nice and cool.</li>
    <li> Amazing pair of clippers! Whisper quiet get very powerful. I have two as my daily work horses. I&#x27;ve only been a professional barber for 2 years but I&#x27;ve tried quite a few clippers and these are by far my favorite pair. I only wish silver senior word didn&#x27;t rub off with time.</li>
    <li> Bought the cheapest ones I could find up to now.  These Wahl 5-star are great.  And the attachments have a wide range of sizes.</li>
    <li> Got this clipper in december but never used it coz it is more louder than my old wahl clippers and i noticed that the blade is not straight. I believed it is defective and i cannot return it anymore. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> These clippers got her on time but had a major problem when I opened the package. The blade on these clippers were misaligned or crooked. The moving blade was way off. Also it came with black lint or something on the back of the blade. This clipper also came pre oiled wich ment this was a used returned clipper.  My guess is probably someone tried to zero gap these and messed up. Therefore returning them to the sellers and sellers selling them to me. Overall these clippers would be perfect if they were new and blades were alligned correct</li>
    <li> I am a student stylist. And i was really exicited when i usdd them the first time. They work so good.</li>
    <li> very professional not a cheapcutter</li>
    <li> I have bought a number of clippers over the years, Wahl, Conair, etc. Most suffered from ridiculously weak motors. The Wahl Designer was the best of the previous bunch. The magnetic motor had good torque, but my ex roommate walked off with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a new purchase so I cannot speak to longevity but I am happy with the Senior 9000. They make a 5000 too. This one is listed as the 5000 but I checked before purchase and it is the 9000 (stronger motor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my boy&#x27;s hair (12 and 13 years) once a month with clippers. Their hair is normal, not especially thick or thin but it clogged most of the previous clippers badly. I would go over and over the same spot to get a clean cut. Sometimes their hair would stop the clippers (not battery powered).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Senior cut beautifully.</li>
    <li> From the beginning, I believed in these clippers, using them in a proffesional capacity.  But it wasn&#x27;t until I changed the original cutting blades with new replacements that I started to see solid production, enabling me to compete with the barbers around me.  So the bottom line is, the stock blades may need replacment and or adjustment when first purchased.  When the blades are properly adjusted these clippers are 5 star and a dream to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Senior Clipper for the past couple of years to cut my sons&#x27; hair. It has held up great but I do want to warn about the heating up point. It takes about 20 minutes for it to heat up and the boys claim they can feel it. I have two boys, so when I&#x27;m done with the older one&#x27;s fade, I do a buzz for the little one. Comes with plastic the standard Wahl plastic guards. I haven&#x27;t looked into buying another one but I&#x27;ll probably stick with Wahl.</li>
    <li> Been cutting my own hair since I was in the army and these are by far the best clippers I have ever had. Powerful, cuts through my course hair with ease. Much better than buying the cheap 20 dollar wahls from walmart. Shouldve saved my money long ago and invested it in these. After about a year still have had no issues.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t own this particular set, but the clippers do get hot IF you do not apply the oil properly. I thought the oil was to simply keep the blades sharp but it is not. Think about it, it&#x27;s metal on metal friction for 20 minutes to a hour of use if you&#x27;re using them at home. You wouldn&#x27;t run your car without oil in the engine would you? No. Use the oil every time and it will significantly lower the amount of heat you&#x27;re getting while you&#x27;re cutting your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this set soon. I had an issue with the Deluxe Pro set, but will be ordering these to replace them.</li>
    <li> Gets too hot too fast</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on suggestions from fellow barbers. I went through 3 pair in 6 months, sending them back for the same reason every time; pulling hair.  When you&#x27;re working fast, pulling can cause injury to the client.  Also, the lettering on top started rubbing off in the 1st week. After the 3rd one started pulling hair, I was done.  I went back to my Wahl Sterling 4. Despite the raving of my co-workers, this machine is definitely not for me and my clients.  Amazon was amazing with exchanges/returns though! They sent my replacement BEFORE I returned the bad one, and gave me a PAID return address label so I had no out of pocket expense to return.</li>
    <li> I love these Clippers! Had to adjust the blades (because I like a closer cut) but most Clippers come like that. Best machine I&#x27;ve ever owned by far.</li>
    <li> The best clippers ever for the price.,fades well you see no lines in your cuts.,I will definitely buy a second pair, they don&#x27;t get hot .A Barber&#x27;s Dream</li>
