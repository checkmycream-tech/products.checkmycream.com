    <li> Disappointing!  Saw no difference.</li>
    <li> This Copper Peptide is wonderful for helping wrinkles and brown spots on my hands.</li>
    <li> I added this into my night cream.  It works great.  My skin looks brighter and smoother.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better for erasing/unperceptible scars.  I have all the expensive creams and lotions: Isomers, Signature A, Strivectin, etc.  None of them worked.  I fell and hit my forehead against my bedroom dresser leaving a large gash on my forehead.  I started using this product straight up as soon as a scab formed, and now the scar is completely invisible.  I don&#x27;t know about anything else it may do, but I would promise complete success for scar eraser.</li>
    <li> crap i swear it was just water in the bottle</li>
    <li> Excellent products highly recommended it</li>
    <li> I had ordered the DIY (do it yourself) Argeline oil to add to my skin car regimen. But they shipped by mistake this Copper Peptide, well I was going to return and re order the argeline but after reading what it does and knowing that you need peptides especially around jawls and sagging necks who that no I do not have,and will prevent with my regimen I&#x27;m going to be 52 &amp; look in my early thirties!!  so I&#x27;m intrigued to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First note: THIS IS NOT TAP WATER!!  as some have described you can actually feel the texture it feels like a serum, just because its colerless which most or a lot of different serumscare clear, just cause its called copper Dont mean its copper colored, would you want that on your skin? So I&#x27;d ignore those reviews.. But all I do is add a drop in my palm to my hyaluronic acid, or any other one of god knows different organic serums even Emu oil or jojobar oil I.e.  note: (not vitamin C they will interact with each other and do nothing) even if you use a store face cream instead of using chart just add a drop to the amount of creams or organic serums not made to just apply to face.. They all have a sheet (DIY products) that tell u how many drops or teaspoon or half to your existing creams or serums. All are same chart.I just cheat to get a little bit more in my morning routine and then I added to my &amp;#34;Joyal&amp;#34; Hyaluronic Acid that already has Vitamin E and other goodies for the skin (a must buy serum works great).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave it 4 stars and after a couple weeks will update my review. I am an all natural organic no dyes, perfumes, or useless ingredients that are in most of the store brand $100+ creams in other words JUNK..that people waste there money on. Just look at your skin cream Ingredients, if you see that the list is over10 plus long ingredients,and u can&#x27;t even pronounce most like gums, its useless properties to fill your jar and can cause damage to you skin than repair or do nothing  not to mention that they are also most likely tested on animals,and if u seen what they do to them..put were we would like in eyes or make the animal Injest its sickening!!

    <li> Four stars for not breaking me out when mixed with my creams.  Can&#x27;t say that it is working because I really do not have any wrinkles but this is a preventive measure for me.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product for over 30 days, and I can see that my skin is not as moist as  it was when using it. I use it along with my face cream, but I do not follow the product instructions. I just put a drop directly into the face cream, every other day. It did no harm, and it made my skin look better, and feel better (softer). I am re-ordering this product again.  Really like it. Brenda P</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I can control the concentration of copper peptides as my face can adjust. Gives very specific instructions about how to use it with the dropper.</li>
    <li> It is like water actually think it is water, has no smell, no taste. Not sure how you even put it on because it&#x27;s water. Thought it was serum</li>
    <li> You have to use this item long term before you can see a difference so I really have no opinion at this point. it arrived and I am using it.....</li>
    <li> Saw this item promoted as a necessary ingredient with any skin moisturizer.  Also saw it as part of a shampoo ingredient to stimulate hair growth.  So I bought it and added it to my shampoo and facial moisurizer and skin seems to look better and i&#x27;m hoping it helps my hair.  I always like finding something that can add to the effectiveness of something I already am using.</li>
    <li> I have been using this with the copper cream. Not sure how well it works yet since I am not finished with it.</li>
    <li> THEY DID NOT PROVIDE CLEAR INSTRUCTION HOW TO USE IT.  THEY DO NOT MENTION THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT I N THE INSTRUCTIONS SO I AM NOT SURE IF THEY SENT THE WRONG INSTRUCTIONS.  I AM NOT PLEASED AT ALL!</li>
    <li> HAVN&#x27;T SEEN ANY RESULTS YET.</li>
    <li> I didnt expect miracles but hoped for some help. It did nothing. I dont mind not looking 21 but resent spending money for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;It was money thrown away! Did nothing for my skin.</li>
    <li> This was the worst product I have ever bought. First of all, when I opened up the little bottle that it comes in it looks like tap water straight from the sink. I have never felt so ripped off before until now.  I felt like they added water to the bottle and just shipped it out to me. I have shipped this product back to the consumer, and they have agreed to refund my money, and have also sent me samples of moisturizer cream.  Personally, I don&#x27;t know how there could be any copper anything inside that bottle when it looks like tap water straight from the sink and I will never order anything from this company again. I felt like I was ripped off and taken for my money for a bottle of tap water that cost me $34.00. However, they did agree to refund my money, and I was very thankful for that, but I will never order from this company again. Please be aware when ordering products off the internet, you really don&#x27;t know what your getting until you get it in the mail and have already paid for it and you find that the product is no good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now in my moisturizer and with my sensitive, acne prone skin, I&#x27;m very surprised that it hasn&#x27;t irritated me.  I heard on Dr. Oz that copper is good for your skin so I decided to give it a try and I can honestly say that I believe I see a difference in my skin.  It hasn&#x27;t broken me out or irritated me and there&#x27;s not many products I can say that about.  I would say I would buy again but since you only have to use a small amount in your moisturizer and mix it, it seems that this small bottle will lasts years.</li>
    <li> is this product fantastic, or is it ? I have seen a difference in my skin that has left me speechless, and that is hard to do. Love this product.</li>
    <li> It might take a little bit of time, but this actually seems to work.</li>
    <li> Only been using it for over a week and I can notice a difference already. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product is great. I added it to emu oil very sparingly. I am loving the results...its been approx 4 weeks</li>
    <li> This is a great deal on a good product.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  It went beyond my expectations!!! Love this stuff My skin has cleared of all flaws</li>
    <li> I have used copper peptides off and on for many years.  I love the products but dang, most are very expensive.  I found this product and decided to try and it.  I think it&#x27;s exceptional.  I still get breakouts and for me, this is truly amazing at wound healing.  I do mix one drop of this product with my regular skincare twice a day, morning and night.  So while you can put the formula into your serums or whatever, and I&#x27;m certain that&#x27;s effective, doing what I just described has proven to be great.  Smaller pores, clearer skin, glowy skin, etc....will be the benefits of adding this product to your skincare.  Be careful with using vitamin C products at the same time.  Copper and vitamin C can effect one another.  You can use one at night and the other in the morning or visa versa.</li>
    <li> Order this now!  I know I sound like someone paid to say this but I am not.  I mixed this with my arbonne face and eye cream.  Just one drop.  You dont apply directly to your skin.  You will not believe your eyes!  In less than a week my skin looks smooth and without pores.  I can&#x27;t even believe it myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help the skin on my arms to grow thicker. I have used other brands and had better results. I did follow the instructions to mix in advised amounts with and oil but with poor results.  Every body is different and it could work for you</li>
    <li> This is perfect for adding to you lotions and other products for the extra benefit of copper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll give it a 5, but I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m looking for. I am using this with other products that I have bought for the rash on my arm from my chemo therapy. Seems to be working.</li>
