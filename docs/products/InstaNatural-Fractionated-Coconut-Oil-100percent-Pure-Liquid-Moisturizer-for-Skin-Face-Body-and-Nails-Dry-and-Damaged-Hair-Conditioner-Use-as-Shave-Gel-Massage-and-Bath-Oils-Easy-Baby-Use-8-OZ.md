<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing product. I&#x27;m in love with fractionated coconut oil, I have used it for many years, since my first DIY recipes. It&#x27;s amazing in skin, hair and nail care. I&#x27;m allergic to strong smells, and harsh chemicals; so I also use it with my natural essential oil dilution to prepare facial masks, stress relief, joint pain relief, headache, body massage, exfoliation, soap, natural perfumes, home fragrance, sprays, and bug killers. ( for recipes just google under &amp;#34;fractionated coconut oil recipes/uses&amp;#34;. Fractionated Coconut Oil is also abbreviated to FCO; so be sure to understand it when reading recipes. I couldn&#x27;t say enough about the multiple uses of fco, but if you are developing a healthy, natural, chemical free environment for you, and your family; you couldn&#x27;t go wrong with this excellent quality, quantity, and great price. Thanks InstaNaturals for this wonderful oil, please keep the excellent work! I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not the coconut oil that I&#x27;m used to - I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; (the oil that is also all natural, but has a butter-like consistency until warmed). I was very surprised at how much oil is in the bottle! It&#x27;s liquid, and doesn&#x27;t have that thick greasy feel - I LOVE applying this!  I use it all the time, hair, body, face. For some reason my legs were getting irritated (sensitive skin, may have been the new laundry detergent), it hurt to shave them, I had red bumps all over them, they were rough and dry - even with lotion.  I knew from using &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; coconut oil that this wouldn&#x27;t hurt and I was hoping it may help soothe the skin.  Yes!  I put it on liberally right out of the shower - legs were on fire, sore, tender - but this gave immediate relief!  And, an hour later the redness was gone, skin felt great. I don&#x27;t have a lingering oily feel with this.  I also don&#x27;t notice a scent, which is nice when I don&#x27;t want to smell like food. Word of warning: The bottle is filled to the rim, so don&#x27;t put the pump into the bottle until you&#x27;ve used a bit.  I was so excited to use it that I immediate put the pump in and quite a bit of oil spilled out *sad face*.... then with slippery hands I picked it up and apparently held it too tight because oil shot out of the pump! *another sad face* It&#x27;s great to have the pump feature, just be careful not to squeeze the bottle! (I still gave it 5 stars because the oil is absolutely amazing - I&#x27;ll deal with the whacky pump, the oil is too good to pass up) Definitely a thumbs up product!</li>
    <li> I really like it so far, but the package is poor. the seal was popped off in the box before it came to my house, so when I got the box, it was leaking and messy. I did not return it b/c I like it, but they really should improve the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has a hole or some sort of loose made. the oil constantly comes out, and I keep this on a tray.</li>
    <li> Coconut always been ones of the best product for hair &amp; skin this oil without smell its the perfect coconut oil for all that mentioned, leave you skin looking shine &amp; also smooth</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil. You can use it for many of things. I use it on my hair at night and rub it on my skin.LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Great product.  No bad smell.  The only problem is it had leaked during shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My daughter and I use it all over. We remove make up, moisturize our skin before applying lotion, use it on our hair, feet and cuticles. I also have used it for cleansing a rash on my collar bone.  The skin is too irritated and dry for soap. Wonderful product. Now if we could just get the dog not to try and lick our skin. I guess she likes it also.</li>
    <li> I just love Instanatural. I have sensitive skin but did not get any allergy reaction from many of&#x27;th production&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Use this every night after bath, an  on mg cuticle before bed time. Skin is so so soft, and no more dry cuticle. Very happy.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered  a chance to try this with discount, but my opinion is all mine, and unbiased.</li>
    <li> This product is not all natural. Also when using this product it makes my skin smell like a moldy musty rag. Very gross!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started using this in place of my traditional shaving cream and it works so much better! It stays on, provides a close shave, and leaves my legs feeling much more moisturized than any other shaving cream I&#x27;ve tried. Be careful though, it can make your shower slippery.</li>
    <li> Great for eczema, almost as good as prescription medication</li>
    <li> I like this coconut oil. It removes make up well and leaves my skin moisturized and supple so two thumbs up for that! Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t like it more than the versatile food grade coconut oil I get in a giant tub at Sam&#x27;s. I will definitely recommend to someone who&#x27;s just looking for a nice bath oil.</li>
    <li> Very messy.  Also, this ISNT for food.  I use to moisturize if I don&#x27;t have anywhere to go b/c I will leave a trail of greese</li>
    <li> The product is great. I am using as a makeup remover, body moisturizer, hair conditioner etc. definitely a multi-use product and well worth the money. It is not as moisturizing as regular coconut oil in my opinion but is a lighter less greasy option that does well under makeup. The packaging was dissapointing. The bottle had leaked prior to arrival and I lost 1/4 of the oil which was frustrating. I will purchase again but will find a different maker if packaging leaks again.</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil, i use the oil for many things.I have never tried Fractionation coconut oil ,thus was my first time,so I was a little skeptical,but I must say my hair,skin loved it,my hair was very soft,moisturized,my skin very,very soft moisturized,I have always loved coconut oil,this I s my go to oil,now that I gave discovered this brand I am sold,it also comes with a pump,which makes it so much easy to distribute.Good for making your own DIY Hair and skin products.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my massage oil and it&#x27;s perfect! It absorbs in your skin fast and I love that it&#x27;s unscented. Some people like the coconut smell but as for me this is an awesome product! I recommend buying this</li>
    <li> Really moisturizes my dry, flaky skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> this product is very good i like the fact that it is an oil form and comes with the pump. there is no smells/odors. its goes on silky smooth and does not leave greasy residue it absorbs into the skin and hair very well i will be buying this product again when i am out but i know its going to be a while because the size is very generous</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at a greatly reduced price because I was willing to give my honest opinion about it. I have used this on my skin after my shower and it makes your skin very hydrated and feel so soft. I have also used it as a conditioner in my hair and it has brightened my hair and made it feel soft. This is a super great product that has many uses.</li>
    <li> half of the oil had spilled by the time I received it and extra greasy then others that I&#x27;ve used before</li>
    <li> I love this oil in liquid form. I have used it as a skin moisturizer. I also put it on my hair daily as a sealer after I moisturize. It is very light and I love the pump option.</li>
    <li> I really like this Fractionated Coconut Oil so far, and I&#x27;m super excited to use this FCO to make some roller bottles with my essential oils!</li>
    <li> This is a nice coconut oil that absorbs quickly. I love using it on my skin, but I didn&#x27;t particularly enjoy it in my hair...I didn&#x27;t use that much, and my hair still looked and felt super greasy. The oil has almost no smell at all. That might be a pro for most people, but I enjoy the natural smell of coconut oil, and would have liked this product a little more if it had retained some of the natural coconut aroma. All in all, I do like this oil, and will probably purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Great for my skin! I use it first thing in the morning and after showers</li>
    <li> Great product! The oil absorbs very quickly into my skin and does not leave a greasy feeling. No perfumes or dyes which is  best . I also use it as a hair conditioner, I apply it to the ends and leave it on 15 or 20 minutes before washing it. My hair looks beautiful and shiny after.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I put it on when I come out of the shower and it keeps my skin soft &amp; hydrated without being greasy. Also the company shot me an email on all the uses of the product after I made the purchase. That was a nice personal touch. I am definitely purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great coconut oil.  I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  Also use it as moisturizer.  Wonderful.</li>
    <li> one of the bottles LEAKed (the box came stained and a little bit messy.)</li>
    <li> Awesome coconut oil! Once you rub it in it&#x27;s not greasy at all. It hasn&#x27;t stained my clothes or anything. It&#x27;s also completely odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks and feels great! It&#x27;s smooth without being greasy.  The oil also works well as a makeup remover. I&#x27;m going to try using it on my hair soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  customer service was phenomenal as well! I had a slight issue with the way it was packed (it leaked a little) so they sent me another one no questions asked! They were incredibly polite and responded quickly. They also checked in to make sure I liked it and offered a complementary refill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a great product and a great company. And it&#x27;s the lowest price I could find too! I will definitely continue to buy from them. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Nice product leaves skin feeling nice and soft it has no smell to it. I bought it to treat my KP so I will leave another reviews in a few weeks to see if I had any results!</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel really soft. I have t be careful what I use so it won&#x27;t break me out. I really like this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my face or hair. Weighs down my hair for sure.Good for the body and feet!</li>
    <li> comes with a spray, very nice product.</li>
    <li> Love using this with my essential oils on myself and for my kids!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Product works well but was very unhappy when I unpacked it. The oil was all over the side of the packaging so it felt messy. That aside the oil is a great moisturizer and what I expected.</li>
    <li> Loss some of my contents..packaged poorly.spilled on other items</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product including the big bottle (nice bang for the buck) and the pump that comes with it.  It absorbs quickly leaving my skin so soft without feeling greasy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> GREAT! Fast absorbing and no scent at all.</li>
    <li> AMMMMAAZZINGG!. My boyfriend uses it and and i use it in my kids hair!!!!!!!! I love this</li>
    <li> I had never heard of fractionated coconut oil until I started making my own deodorant, which calls for coconut oil that has to be warmed up when mixing.  Then I noticed that some of the recipes called for fractionated coconut oil.  So, I ordered this and found that it is much easier to use in deodorant making.  I’ve also used it as a carrier oil with my essential oils and have noticed that it absorbs easily.  I decided to use it to condition my hair, and it did a better job than any hair conditioner that I have ever purchased.  It is a great product, and it’s organic which is important to me.</li>
    <li> I have long wanted an essential oil carrier.  Even though I wear oils that can be worn un-diluted, I liked the idea of spreading out the scent (like when you used to be able to mix your own lotion at The Body Shop.  Fractionated coconut oil is a GREAT carrier of oils because it has no smell and is amazing for your skin, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put two pumps of oil into my palm, and dripped in one drop of patchouli (a small drop, from the end of a stick, not from a dropper), and covered my arm.  I now have this overall patchouli scent, with no added anything (except moisturization).  I received a discount for reviewing this product honestly, and I only accepted it because I knew I would love it.  And, I do.  Happiness is the smell of a diffuser walking around with you all day (because it&#x27;s you!).  I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought Instanatural&#x27;s 100% Fractionated Coconut Oil.  Upon opening my package, I was surprised to see how huge the bottle was.  I included an image of it with a tube of lipstick for a size reference.  Plus it came with a pump, which is a preferred method for me when using beauty products.  I love coconut oil and regularly buy it, but usually get it in a jar from my local health food store - so again, the pump really helps instead of spooning it out.  When this arrived, my curiosity was piqued.  I was bracing myself for that &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; smell when opening the bottle, but it was odorless.  This is a huge plus for me because my husband doesn&#x27;t like it when coconut smells very strong and when I showed him this, he was surprised as well.  One of the things I like to do is put coconut oil in my hair, so now I don&#x27;t have to worry about the coconut aroma being so strong.  It absorbs really well into the skin, e.g. using it to moisturize my hands in the morning, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, and by the end of the day, holds up well.  I did not know about fractionated coconut oil and all of its uses - so many!  I tried out a few - does a lovely job as a makeup remover, added some sugar to it for a scrub, added peppermint oil for a massage oil for my heels.  By the way, usually essential oils come in small bottles - so this coconut oil helps to &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; a drop of essential oil.  Excited to try out more things with this - I love products that are &amp;#34;jack of all trades&amp;#34;.  This is a new staple in my beauty cabinet!  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
    <li> It absorbs easily into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy at all!  I&#x27;m telling all my friends how great this stuff is...**smile**  BUT the bottle wasn&#x27;t fully closed and all the packaging was rather oily when I opened the box....Still, I&#x27;d order it again....</li>
    <li> Products was great. But i click subscribe by misstake. Now i return second button that no longer need. And amazon such a great website that easy to buy and retrun item even refound.&lt;br /&gt;I still need to buy more of this oil when i run out. Cuz no allergy to it. And smoot nice feel great for massage.</li>
    <li> We have been using coconut oil for a few years now.  Use it as a general moisturizer for entire body, i put it on my hair, use it as a component in homemade deodorant and i even use it for oil-pulling (rinsing my mouth and teeth).  The problem with traditional oil is it gets VERY hard in colder temperatures - this problem goes away with using fractionated oil as it is always liquid.  Now I am able to use this as a carrier oil for homeopathic mixes (which I put in a roller ball).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is quite large and will last me a long time!  It comes with a pump which helps to not spill it if you had to pour it instead.  I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Will purchase it again!</li>
    <li> So far, I am not too impressed with this coconut oil as a makeup remover. That is why I purchased it.  When it arrived, there was oil all over the bottle, the box, and all of the contents inside. It was a mess! My skin doesn&#x27;t seem to like this product too well.  I&#x27;ve gotten a few breakouts since using it a few days ago. I want to like it, as I love other products by InstaNatural.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, feels great on my skin and hair. The product actually leaked a little in the package but when I emailed them about this issue, they were very nice about it and let me know they r working on that problem. They even offered to do a refund (which i didn&#x27;t want since the product itself was amazing). Thanks for being so professional and kind! I would give you more than five star if I could!!</li>
    <li> Hmmmm....coconut oil!</li>
    <li> I have used coconut oil in the past but I love the InstaNatural coconut oil. I like that it comes with a pump for easy application. It is an unbelievable moisturizer! It has so many uses. I&#x27;ve seen 101 uses online. The product is light. When you first use it, realize it is a little greasy at first but it very quickly is soaked into your skin. I love that is a natural moisturizer, rather than full of chemicals in store bought products. You will not be disappointed! I was able to get this at a reduced price to give my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Four stars, because it did leak a little. Not by much, but I noticed that the seal on top was slightly lifted. When you put the pump in the bottle it is really full so some will leak out as well if you are not careful. As far as the quality of the coconut oil-it&#x27;s great. For the price you can&#x27;t beat it and a little goes a long way. Happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Oh my stars! This is like no other coconut oil I have ever tried! It is fast absorbing, and so easy to apply. No more waiting for the oil to melt on the skin. It is such a smooth and healing oil. I use it as a oil body wash in shower, makeup remover (which by the way has now helped u eye lashes grow and stay healthy)BONUS!!! I use it as moisturizer, over night hair treatment,  and mix it with either lemon or lavender essential oil (from InstaNatural) as a foot massage ...my feet love it. No more aching or sandle heal feet :). I highly, highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cocnut oil. it has an easy squirt top that dispenses so nice. I use this oil for so many uses, make up remover, add some sugar for a wonderful scrub, a pre-shampoo hair treatment, body oil, and on my cuticles. Wonderful product from instanatural. Was so lucky I got to try for a small fee and my honest opinion. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I use coconut oil on everything, it&#x27;s nice to have it be convenient!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality!  I just ordered another one!  Very happy with the purchase,</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have always used coconut oil on my kids instead of moisturizer. This product is fantastic because it comes in a liquid form. Think about it moms and dads, kids put their hands in their mouths all the time. Make it something non- toxic.</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed that it does not smell like coconut, but it does work well for moisturizing the skin. It showed up quickly, wrapped in a plastic; however, a little bit had leaked into the plastic cover. I do like that it came with a pump, as that makes it easier to apply.</li>
    <li> This product is a great product. Coconut Oil is the best thing out there and this bottle gives you the opportunity to pour from spout or to pump in hand. I love that feature becuase you can wash your hair with it easily and your on your skin without spilling it. This leaves your skin moist and shiny all day long. It also helps with split ends and makes your hair feel like it was just deep conditioned from the salon.&lt;br /&gt;The directions are clear and useful and the list of other uses is a brilliant concept for people like me who love to use one item univserally.</li>
    <li> Great quality product - I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils and its great.&lt;br /&gt;Could use better packing for shipping - the bottle leaked everywhere.</li>
    <li> I use the coconut oil daily. For skin and hair. it&#x27;s not to oily.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were just a tad bit thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I like it and will buy again</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;Great for the body</li>
    <li> “It works fantastic! It smooth your skin beautifully! Highly recommend it! Great seller, thank you! ”</li>
    <li> The best so far. Works well for me :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even review whether or not this is a good product because it came like this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also shipped with a clothing item that was ruined by the oil</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! I use it on my lips at night and they have not been chapped at all. My daughter puts a little on her hair. I love using it before going on the pool, no more tight, itchy skin. A little bit goes a long long way. It absorbs quickly and last all day.</li>
    <li> First time trying this product.  Rubs on skin feeling like silk and absorbs quickly so you don&#x27;t stay &#x27;greasy&#x27; like when using regular coconut oil.  Love the fact that there are no other ingredients in this product!  I have not tried it as a conditioner for my hair but plan to do so soon.</li>
    <li> I use this as a moisturizer for my body and for my hair when it&#x27;s wet. I also used it for cooking, using the included pump is convenient than cap.&lt;br /&gt;One of my friend is crazy about this oil and told me about all the benefits, I know she takes it a teaspoonful a couple of times a day.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried that way yet, but one day I might try since her skin looks always amazing, this oil is good stuff to use so many ways!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I use it daily as a body and hand moisturizer.  So much more effective than a lotion.</li>
    <li> I just got my in the mail today. I just have to say that this stuff is great!!!! I thought was going to be oily but no is smooth and absorbs into the skin like a charm. I  mixed with a few drops of my essential oil and I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I had been reading about all the positive uses/benefits of coconut oil so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have been using it on my skin, in my biracial daughter&#x27;s hair before straightening it, oil pulling before brushing my teeth and even for moisturizer after being out in the sun.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and mess-free.  I will definitely be reordering again very soon when this bottle is empty!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, soaks right in, very little scent.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how big this bottle was when it arrived &amp; the pump was a nice bonus, makes it so much easier. I use a lot of coconut oil for my homemade products, normally it comes in solid form, but it&#x27;s nice to have it in liquid form also. I can pump it in my hand &amp; apply it directly where I want it, I use it as a carrier oil or sometimes just as it was a body lotion, but w/ no toxins like over the counter lotions contain. It does not leave a greasy feeling once it dries and you can apply make up over it, keeps your skin nice and moisturized. Also since its in liquid form it makes it easier to add to roller balls if you like to mix your oils like I do. This particular bottle had no scent, which depending on your preference could be a good or bad thing; didn&#x27;t matter to me cause i usually mix it anyways. I really like it &amp; would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Have found that coconut oil has so many uses especially for my dry skin and hair but have never been in love with the coconut smell so this product completely fits the bill as it is unscented and I can use it with my regular fragrance.  It&#x27;s a winner for me and I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> its a really large bottle . it did spill a bit during shipment</li>
    <li> Although it spilled during the transit, I love coconut oil.  It has so many uses so it is well worth your money.</li>
    <li> Just like all the other items from instanatural this one works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my hair, skin. Love it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product- truly moisturizing!  Great product for those with really dry skin.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great, the bottle had leaked in shipping</li>
    <li> Being a California girl, we can all agree this summer heat is nasty. With that being said, it&#x27;s you can&#x27;t use a lot of products on the hair due to the humidity. However, this coconut oil does the trick! I love the fact that is fractionated. You get the same great benefits of coconut oil without the smell. Not that I don&#x27;t appreciate the coconut smell but the heat makes it smell nastier than it should. In addition, I work in an office that forbids scented products so this is a big plus for me. Also, I really love the application! This is the first coconut oil product I see that offers a pump! I&#x27;ve been using a spoon to scoop it out of the container and at times like this, it becomes really liquidy. This makes application easy and mess free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do think can improve is the packaging. When I received the product, it leaked a bit.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff! and love the bottle it comes in - so handy and mess free</li>
    <li> Mixed with Shea Butter makes a great moisturizing lotion.</li>
    <li> I love coconut oil as a beauty product!  I use it for makeup remover, skin moisturizer, &amp; hair treatments.  This was the first time trying out fractionated oil. Since this is always liquid regardless of the temperature, it was much easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it only 4 stars because of the pump.  You have to be careful when using it or it will pump oil right past your hand. Once you know what to expect, you are prepared the next time.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> So far I have enjoy using this, my skin is very soft. However, it leaked all over the box and my other products, also the pump does not work.</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this oil. Not too greasy.</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is made in USA.  The package including a pump and in a nice size.  I use it on my dry skin and sometimes massage into scalp,</li>
    <li> using this now on my pregnant belly</li>
    <li> The coconut oil is great, but it leaked all over the package. It was a mess!</li>
    <li> Nice, lightweight oil that does a great job moisturizing.  I love that this is a pure product.  Ordered 3 bottles, one of them opened in transit (the little foil cover under the cap that protects the bottle was open when it arrived so it leaked a bit), but that is probably a fluke that may have been caused by the shipper.</li>
    <li> Love thus coconut oil not greasy makes my hands and neck feel smooth.. I love what it does for my hair I don&#x27;t put a lot on but I rinse multiple times..</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it on my damp hair together with ISO Bouncy Creme, and they both add definition and shine to my curls. I also use the coconut oil as a skin moisturizer. It is wonderful on my elbows, the heels of my feet, and on my legs after shaving. Although the oil is runny, once you get used to the pump and how much it squirts out, there&#x27;s not a problem. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!!This hydrates my skin all day!!! Cocoa butter doesn&#x27;t even do that! I also use this on the tips of my hair as its the driest past of my hair. I also use this on my 7 month old on her skin and hair. It doesn&#x27;t have much of an scent which I appreciate. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I will definitely be buying this sad long as its made!!!</li>
    <li> love this oil and easier to use than the hard one</li>
