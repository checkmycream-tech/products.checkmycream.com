    <li> Ordered these clippers because I wanted something that could cut very sharp without having to use a razor (and these do just that). This product is small, and compact. Runs on 1 AA Battery. Once the battery starts to die out, the clippers obviously don&#x27;t work as well. But the money you&#x27;ll constantly spend on batteries (and replacement blades like a lot of people do) you would be better for spending $50 in the Andis T Outliner clippers and saving money that way in the long run.</li>
    <li> this is not a trimmer, just a mini clipper</li>
    <li> Great clipper,I love them for the reason of getting those tricky angles on my beard that I usually can&#x27;t get with my Andis T-Wide. It cuts the hair very smoothly, I can really get my beard to the shape of my desire with this clipper......</li>
    <li> Zero gap da blades and get to work, I love them!!!!</li>
    <li> These are good trimmers, but I though they might be a little more fine toothed than my cheap Conair beard trimmer.  Nope... about the same.  These are wider and more comfortable.  I don&#x27;t like the small single battery design.  The motor bogs down unless you keep a relatively new battery in it.</li>
    <li> make sure to oil your clippers! very good, precise, feel like a barber using this thing.</li>
    <li> These things are frigen amazing. Doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s battery powered these things cut. I got about 9 months of all the time use out of these things. Great especially when you&#x27;re overseas and can&#x27;t get the voltage right for the other edgers.</li>
    <li> Great product and more powerful than I thought. I also like how it handles rough and wet hair so well. Not to mention it takes Double(AA) batteries</li>
    <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, THIS THING IS HORRIBLE, YOU ARE BETTER OFF BUYING A BEARD TRIMMER FOR 15-20 BUCKS</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great it&#x27;s small it doesn&#x27;t get hot and it has a great price to guality ratio and while it doesn&#x27;t get as close as other trimmers on the market do I personally love it and would 100% recommend someone to buy it</li>
