      <li>Wonderful stuff</li>
      <li>great delivery, great quality</li>
      <li>Always smells great.</li>
      <li>This is our favorite bay rum cologne, it&#x27;s the best that we have tried.</li>
      <li>Which may be good if you&#x27;re going for that.</li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly and we are very happy.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Bay Rum is one of the best natural smelling colognes.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful, masculine scent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this cologne for more than 5 years and always get compliments.  </li>
      <li>and I want it all for myself :)</li>
      <li>Smells more Christmasy than beachy to me</li>
      <li>One more word.</li>
      <li>A favorite of his, so glad Iwas able to find.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find it from an Amazon retailer, now I might be able to enjoy using it another year or two.</li>
      <li>Has a strong odor of cloves or something.  </li>
      <li>Never too strong, smells fresh and spicy, like an island breeze...</li>
      <li>Before the Bay Rum I bought the Natural BB cologne which was really nice.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s not necessarily bad.</li>
      <li>So if you get a fresh product it needs to be used fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>not as good as the other Burt&#x27;s Bees cologne</li>
      <li>Thank you for helping me make Christmas a little more special for my parents!</li>
      <li>I was able to find this for the second time on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It seems to have more of a Pine smell than other bay rums but that&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>the scent is very distinctive.  </li>
      <li>The first bottle was good,but didn&#x27;t like as much as the Natural BBs.  </li>
      <li>This is a classic.</li>
      <li>Just a little more earthy than spicy.</li>
      <li>The second bottle was okay, but halfway into it there was a strange smell.  </li>
      <li>He was pretty surprised to open it up as it is discontinued in many other stores.  </li>
      <li>We love this product and appreciate that Amazon offers it online because it is not easy to find.</li>
      <li>Either many sample &amp;#34;sprits&amp;#34; had been used from this bottle or the product had evaporated over time (hard to believe in a sealed bottle).</li>
      <li>Been through a few different brands, and while I like Burt&#x27;s, this is just a bit too light of a scent.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no other than Burt&#x27;s Bees for Bay Rum after shave cologne.</li>
      <li>In my opinion this is not typical of a traditional bay rum.</li>

<li> I have used many Burt&#x27;s Bees products through years and it is a simple fact that they will go bad.  </li>
<li> Finally found it, expensive, but worth it.</li>
<li> It has an overpowering pine scent that takes away from the spicy notes and musky overtones that would be expected.</li>
<li> Anyway, the bottle arrived here partially emptied.</li>
<li> Fortunately it was only the cologne, but disappointed we had to throw it out (literally).  </li>
<li> It is not like every other mens cologne out there.</li>
<li> Disappointing - although placing the bottle in your clothes closet as an air freshener works pretty well</li>
<li> It is a subtle fragrance that lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> IMO a few of the ingredients had exceeded their shelf lives and altered the scent to a degree.</li>
<li> My husband who has a weak sense of smell noticed it.  </li>
<li> and it was bad from the beginning.  </li>

    <li> Wish Burts Bees still made this.  Wonderful stuff</li>
    <li> not as good as the other Burt&#x27;s Bees cologne I&#x27;d had which was a different, discontinued scent.  Just wasn&#x27;t for me.  Maybe some patchouli stink in it?  Not a fan of smelling like I&#x27;m covering up pot stink.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Bay Rum is one of the best natural smelling colognes. We love this product and appreciate that Amazon offers it online because it is not easy to find. The product arrived quickly and we are very happy.</li>
    <li> My dad likes obscure colognes.  I was able to find this for the second time on Amazon.  He was pretty surprised to open it up as it is discontinued in many other stores.  Thank you for helping me make Christmas a little more special for my parents!</li>
    <li> This product had obviously been on the shelf for quite a while. Either many sample &amp;#34;sprits&amp;#34; had been used from this bottle or the product had evaporated over time (hard to believe in a sealed bottle). Anyway, the bottle arrived here partially emptied. IMO a few of the ingredients had exceeded their shelf lives and altered the scent to a degree. I won&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
    <li> Before the Bay Rum I bought the Natural BB cologne which was really nice.  When I could no longer find that I bought the Bay Rum.  The first bottle was good,but didn&#x27;t like as much as the Natural BBs.  The second bottle was okay, but halfway into it there was a strange smell.  My husband who has a weak sense of smell noticed it.  When my son took it out to put on a rancid smell permeated throughout the house a bit like an electrical socket burning.  Fortunately it was only the cologne, but disappointed we had to throw it out (literally).  I bought another and it was bad from the beginning.  Maybe this is the reason that Bay Rum was discontinued.  I have used many Burt&#x27;s Bees products through years and it is a simple fact that they will go bad.  So if you get a fresh product it needs to be used fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Got for my son, who tells me that Burt&#x27; Bees no longer makes.  A favorite of his, so glad Iwas able to find.</li>
    <li> I like bay rum. Been through a few different brands, and while I like Burt&#x27;s, this is just a bit too light of a scent. Which may be good if you&#x27;re going for that. You&#x27;ll spray it on, and forget it was ever there until you smell it in your sweat.</li>
    <li> In my opinion this is not typical of a traditional bay rum. It has an overpowering pine scent that takes away from the spicy notes and musky overtones that would be expected. Disappointing - although placing the bottle in your clothes closet as an air freshener works pretty well</li>
    <li> much worse than the BB Original.  Has a strong odor of cloves or something.  threw it out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely a Bay Rum. It seems to have more of a Pine smell than other bay rums but that&#x27;s not bad. Just a little more earthy than spicy. Smells more Christmasy than beachy to me but that&#x27;s not necessarily bad. Lasts longer than any bay rum I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is a classic. Always smells great. I buy it for my father whenever I can find it. I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, masculine scent.  He loves it and so do I when he wears it.  Never too strong, smells fresh and spicy, like an island breeze...</li>
    <li> This is our favorite bay rum cologne, it&#x27;s the best that we have tried.</li>
    <li> Nobody else buy this. They stopped making it and I want it all for myself :) Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for more than 5 years and always get compliments.  It is a subtle fragrance that lasts a long time.  I was glad to find it from an Amazon retailer, now I might be able to enjoy using it another year or two.</li>
    <li> great delivery, great quality</li>
    <li> the scent is very distinctive.  It is not overpowering but does last all day.  It is not like every other mens cologne out there.</li>
    <li> Finally found it, expensive, but worth it. There&#x27;s no other than Burt&#x27;s Bees for Bay Rum after shave cologne. One more word.</li>
