    <li> Helps tame hair frizzies!</li>
    <li> I first discovered Sebastian Defrizz-Polishing Drops at my beaut salon. When they stopped carrying it, I found it on Amazon. I&#x27;ve reordered it several times. My hair isn&#x27;t normally shiny, but it is when I use the Drops!</li>
    <li> My friend works for a chemical company that tests various products and told me that it was found that this product actually repairs split ends if applied at the bottom of the hair.  Prior to that (and currently) I use this product as a finishing step after blow-drying my hair and I love the way my hair feels when I smooth the bottoms over with this. It really keeps the frizzies down!</li>
    <li> Wish I could give a no star review....I&#x27;ve purchased this product from a salon before, what was shipped to me is not that product.... doesn&#x27;t smell like the real one or have the consistency..... it&#x27;s more like mineral oil...... so not happy......</li>
    <li> Good drops for hair but not amazing, the smell is good and gives shine to my hair, Just fine for me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for my hair. I thought since I use Sebastian shampoo and conditioner, (which i am very satisfied with) this defrizzer would work very well, but I was mistaken. However, I also have extremely thick, coarse hair, so it may work better for different hair types. Currently using chi and am happier with that although I&#x27;m itching to try argan oil.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it everday to keep my hair looking shiny.  Great buy and a great price.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, but Sebastian is the king of ani friz.</li>
