    <li> It is a telescoping mirror, it does have a light.  My husband could only use it to inspect the sole of his foot.  Since it does not angle in all directions it is hard to inspect the top of the foot or the lower leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the bottom of the foot, good device</li>
    <li> good price and works great</li>
    <li> For the people who has diabetes or like to be checking his foot, this is an excellent tool, I definitely recomend it.</li>
    <li> Being a diabetic, I know how important it is to check my feet daily.  Before, I had a telescoping food mirrow without any illumination.  This VAS telescoping mirrow, lighted, is perfect.  It shows up better any area I wish to see.  By being able to cut on and off the light is also a big plus.  When I wear this one out, I plan to order another one.  I have already ordered one to be sent as a gift to someone else.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet.  My mother has and she likes it</li>
    <li> I am a diabetic and need to keep close inspection and track of my feet. unfortunately, I am not as limber as I use to be and This handy inspection mirror fulfills my needs perfectly. It is well made and promises to last.</li>
    <li> The lights on the mirror are very bright but at the angle it is set at, it shines directly into my eyes, making it difficult to see.  But if I direct the angle of the mirror a little up or down, then that makes it useable.</li>
    <li> superb, more than what I expected</li>
    <li> Way too small for doing an inspection. Also they could use some serious magnification&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> This Item is very well built an makes it a lot easier to inspect your feet, product came on time, was well packaged and a very good price.</li>
    <li> I have Diabetes and after a foot infection, my shoe salesman recommended I get a foot inspection mirror.&lt;br /&gt;At first I had difficulty finding one, but remembered Amazon. This mirror is perfect for examining my foot&lt;br /&gt;especially on the bottom. It also is a lighted mirror. This serves the purpose for me</li>
    <li> Lighted makes it even better.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my diabetic father after he had some problems with his feet. He&#x27;s 6 foot 4 and it works great for him!!</li>
    <li> Mirror too narrow and small</li>
    <li> This is a clever tool that will be very helpful.  It telescopes nicely and has a light to help with viewing.  I do wish the mirror was a little bigger. The size listed actually includes the frame.  The mirror itself is 1 1/2\\&quot; x 2 5/8\\&quot;.  Also it needs to be angled so the (very bright) light does not shine in the user&#x27;s eyes.  My husband has neuropathy and is using this to keep ahead of any foot sores.</li>
    <li> It be great if it wasn&#x27;t full of latex</li>
