      <li>I love the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure but decided to try and no regret.</li>
      <li>I love my Clarisonic.  </li>

      <li>For the price, these are great, and fit perfectly with my Clarisonic Mia (not sure why people said they didn&#x27;t fit?)  </li>
      <li>More ruff than the genuine brushes but they work.</li>
      <li>I bought the sensitive one and its great.</li>
      <li>It fits in my Mia 2, but not cleaning and vibrating as original, not as effective as original.</li>
      <li>They fit just fine.</li>
      <li>These seem to fit the Clairsonic MIA2</li>
      <li>I had to return the brush heads as they wouldn&#x27;t fit my clarisonic although it was advertised that they would work it.</li>
      <li>Did not fit perfectly either.</li>
      <li>My daughter has a Clarisonic Mia and it didn&#x27;t fit that either.  </li>
      <li>cause I&#x27;m cheap I might buy these again when I need to.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>But they fit my Clarisonic Mia just fine, and seemed to clean my skin just as well.  </li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t clean as well.</li>
      <li>I would rather pay a bit more and get the real ones.</li>
      <li>Bristles are too soft to be effective.</li>
      <li>These, the sensitive kind, felt like they scraped away a lot of skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Price is good and not much difference in the quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t afford the actual Clarisonic heads</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about ordering them for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>still trying to decide if it&#x27;s worth the price difference, gut instinct says yes.</li>
      <li>Well... at first the brush head was soft and lovely, but</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than buying the actual Clarisonic ones, and just as effective.  </li>
      <li>I bought the sensitive head, and i am totally fine with it.</li>
      <li>and they work just the same :)</li>
      <li>These work okay for them being a generic brand.</li>
      <li>Love these generic brand replacement heads for my clarsonic.  </li>
      <li>Since there were a lot of mixed reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
      <li>This product looks and feels exactly like the clairsonic.</li>
      <li>I always rinse the brush to make sure I get as much soap out of the product as possible.</li>
      <li>We purchased 6 brush heads in order to have a good stock of them, and the same thing is happening with all 6 brush heads on two different clairsonic mia2&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>It is much more dense in feeling as far as volume goes, and much more harsh on my face.</li>
      <li>At first when I got these generic sensitive bristle heads I was pleased.</li>
      <li>I threw them out and ordered Clarisonic brush heads from Nordstrom&#x27;s, they at least have free shipping. :)</li>
      <li>I would not recommend these replacement brush heads as they are very course feeling.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ll go pay for the real thing.  </li>
      <li>Just buy straight from the brand.</li>
      <li>I really wanted these to work</li>
      <li>I tried one brush head and found it to feel a bit like a brillo pad, didn&#x27;t move as much sonically - feel</li>
      <li>The fit and quality is just the same.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t notice a difference between these and the &#x27;real&#x27; ones.</li>
      <li>The price and the delivery was very satisfactory but the product itself is just too abrasive to use.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the future.</li>
      <li>We think the generic brush hairs must be flat, more blunt.</li>
      <li>Great alternative to the expensive brush heads.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend said it was even rougher than the Clarisonic brand Normal brush heads.</li>
      <li>and my face cleanser didn&#x27;t lather like normal.  </li>
      <li>Go get the real thing, this brush just pulls against your face and doesn&#x27;t get you that deep clean you&#x27;re obviously looking for because you got a face brush</li>
      <li>I use Clarisonic&#x27;s Sensitive brush head, my boyfriend uses the Normal.</li>
      <li>it quickly because rough.</li>
      <li>I will use them to clean as they are not worth the cost of returning.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really tell any difference from &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; and generic.  </li>
      <li>Next time I will buy the real ones but</li>
      <li>They really are the same.  </li>
      <li>Too soft.</li>
      <li>Kept using it a few more times, but then all the white bristles were coming out too, so chucked the thing.  </li>
      <li>This seller has better generic brushes than others I have gotten in the past.</li>
      <li>They are still a little rough but not horrible.</li>
      <li>They seem a little more rough than the brand name heads</li>
      <li>but they are little bit more rough than a Clarisonic brand head.  </li>
      <li>the rate these brush heads would need to be replaced, they are less economical than the brand name.</li>
      <li>The only big thing I noticed is that is doesn&#x27;t feel like the head moves as much as the regular ones do.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised, actually!  </li>
      <li>Only one of the two brush heads are for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Thrilled to have found an option which works but isn&#x27;t as expensive as the regulation Clarisonic brand heads.</li>
      <li>The replacement heads are a little stiffer than I think a Sensitive brush should be but it really cleans and exfoliates well.</li>
      <li>Amazing, that people write bad reviews on this, really?</li>
      <li>I recommend you go back to the drawing broad and &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; make them for &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Sounds like these should be taken off the market due to a manufacturing defect - I highly doubt I would have received 6 independent anomalies.</li>

<li> All the mixed reviews, I figured maybe people were a little picky.</li>
<li> I expected a softer brush...</li>
<li> It did not fit or work properly on my standard Clarisonic.</li>
<li> They are a bit rough on the face, but not too bothersome when used once a week.</li>
<li> You have to force them one and the vibration is not right.</li>
<li> I do feel like they aren&#x27;t as soft as clarisonic&#x27;s brushes, but my skin hasn&#x27;t reacted poorly (or at all for that matter).</li>
<li> Scared me when some of the black bristles came off on my face.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to attach the head properly&lt;br /&gt;When it clicks on to the Mia and is turned on&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t vibrate..</li>
    <li> These seem to fit the Clairsonic MIA2 but they do not actually spin when the device is turned on. Something isn&#x27;t clicking into place with these generic brush heads. We purchased 6 brush heads in order to have a good stock of them, and the same thing is happening with all 6 brush heads on two different clairsonic mia2&#x27;s. Sounds like these should be taken off the market due to a manufacturing defect - I highly doubt I would have received 6 independent anomalies.</li>
    <li> I gave this a try-- but they are garbage,  nothing like actual Clarisonic bristles.  These, the sensitive kind, felt like they scraped away a lot of skin.  Just buy straight from the brand.</li>
    <li> Since there were a lot of mixed reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised, actually!  The bristles didn&#x27;t feel that much different.  A reviewer said that the bristles &amp;#34;scraped&amp;#34; her skin but that didn&#x27;t not happen to me at all.  I would definitely buy more of these...especially since they are much less expensive.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell any difference from &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; and generic.  I will purchase again, the price is great.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that while the replacement brush fit, the bristles didn&#x27;t rotate like on the name brand brush so it doesn&#x27;t clean as well.</li>
    <li> We decided to try these out because there was a steep discount compared to the Clairsonic brand. The quality does not stack up and we ended up throwing them and buying the name brand anyway.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t notice a difference between these and the &#x27;real&#x27; ones. I will definitely buy these again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been in the skincare profession for the past 7 years and been using a Clarisonic for the past two years. I use Clarisonic&#x27;s Sensitive brush head, my boyfriend uses the Normal. I took a chance and bought one pack. It is completely different than Clarisonic. It is much more dense in feeling as far as volume goes, and much more harsh on my face. My boyfriend said it was even rougher than the Clarisonic brand Normal brush heads. I talked to a Clarisonic rep I know and the only thing we could think of is that in Clarisonic brushes, each individual brush hair is rounded. We think the generic brush hairs must be flat, more blunt. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bristles are too soft to be effective. Not even close to brand name brush heads.</li>
    <li> They really are the same.  If I mix them up with the brand name version, I can&#x27;t tell a difference.</li>
    <li> Thrilled to have found an option which works but isn&#x27;t as expensive as the regulation Clarisonic brand heads. Many thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> One of the brush heads was defective so I basically paid for two but only received one that was working</li>
    <li> I would not recommend these replacement brush heads as they are very course feeling.  The price and the delivery was very satisfactory but the product itself is just too abrasive to use.</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference these and Clarisonic brush heads.  I&#x27;ll save my money and always purchase these brushes.</li>
    <li> I ordered the replacement brush heads for my clarisonic after discovering this bargain on Amazon. The brush heads that came were actually in a clarisonic box! The fit and quality is just the same. I will definitely order these again!</li>
    <li> I like these as well as the name brand.  The only thing I noticed about these was that on the first few uses,(maybe 3 or 4) a few bristles flew out.  After about 3 times, no more of that and it works just like the others in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The package is generic, but that&#x27;s not the issue - it&#x27;s that the brushes do not circulate/vibrate as they should as a &#x27;regular&#x27; Clarisonic brush. I understand it&#x27;s not from the brand, but I&#x27;ve ordered generic before and never had an issue. These just vibrate in place and the bristles don&#x27;t move. I&#x27;m returning.</li>
    <li> I was shipped two toothbrush replacement heads instead of the clarisonic generic replacement brush heads that were described and shown in the picture!</li>
    <li> I eventually got them screwed in, but it wouldn&#x27;t work.  In this case, knockoffs don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the price, but was disappointed in that it fits oddly and does not rotate properly.  I tried taking it off and putting it back on several times, but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly on my Clarisonic and demonstrated longevity too.</li>
    <li> These work okay for them being a generic brand. After reading reviews on how stiff the bristles are I decided to buy the sensitive ones. They are still a little rough but not horrible. The only big thing I noticed is that is doesn&#x27;t feel like the head moves as much as the regular ones do. Next time I will buy the real ones but cause I&#x27;m cheap I might buy these again when I need to.</li>
    <li> The replacement heads are a little stiffer than I think a Sensitive brush should be but it really cleans and exfoliates well. I just can&#x27;t use it but twice a week.</li>
    <li> The bad reviews were probably paid for!  These fit perfectly on my Clarisonic, the sensitive seems soft to the touch, but perfect on my face.  Amazing, that people write bad reviews on this, really?</li>
    <li> Go get the real thing, this brush just pulls against your face and doesn&#x27;t get you that deep clean you&#x27;re obviously looking for because you got a face brush</li>
    <li> At first when I got these generic sensitive bristle heads I was pleased. All the mixed reviews, I figured maybe people were a little picky. Well... at first the brush head was soft and lovely, but it quickly because rough. It&#x27;s as if the ends of the bristles were splitting. I always rinse the brush to make sure I get as much soap out of the product as possible. I&#x27;ve also washed it a couple of times to ensure the roughness wasn&#x27;t coming from buildup. It&#x27;s still rough and unpleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the rate these brush heads would need to be replaced, they are less economical than the brand name.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to save money by using these generic brush heads for my Clarisonic, but they&#x27;re not even close.  I tried one brush head and found it to feel a bit like a brillo pad, didn&#x27;t move as much sonically - feel and my face cleanser didn&#x27;t lather like normal.  Even tried the second one, and it was the same.  I threw them out and ordered Clarisonic brush heads from Nordstrom&#x27;s, they at least have free shipping. :)</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t afford the actual Clarisonic heads so I get these. They do the trick and are reliable and best of all- affordable.&lt;br /&gt;I buy enough to last me a year so I don&#x27;t have to worry about ordering them for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying. I do feel like they aren&#x27;t as soft as clarisonic&#x27;s brushes, but my skin hasn&#x27;t reacted poorly (or at all for that matter).</li>
    <li> Only one of the two brush heads are for sensitive skin.  Disappointing because I couldn&#x27;t use the other brush head.</li>
    <li> I really wanted these to work but the heads would not seat properly on my Clarisonic. I tried and had the same problem with both. They were hard to line up with the notches to screw on, and no matter how hard I worked at it, they wouldn&#x27;t make that second &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; to lock in so they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;rattle&amp;#34; during use... indicating that they cannot work as intended. Removal was difficult and I was concerned that I might harm my Clarisonic by forcing them out. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic.  However, these heads did not fit!  My daughter has a Clarisonic Mia and it didn&#x27;t fit that either.  I was trying to cut a corner and well, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I had to return the brush heads as they wouldn&#x27;t fit my clarisonic although it was advertised that they would work it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this purchase. Thank goodness for Amazon...I had my return postage and refund promptly managed.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my Clarisonic. Piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Scared me when some of the black bristles came off on my face.  I had only used it maybe... 5x when it started.  Thought I had a big black bug with wings stuck in the soap on me.  Kept using it a few more times, but then all the white bristles were coming out too, so chucked the thing.  Won&#x27;t buy them again, I&#x27;ll go pay for the real thing.  Anybody know where I can get a deal on the brand name stuff?</li>
    <li> One of the brushes was badly damaged.  Could I get a replacement?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> More ruff than the genuine brushes but they work.</li>
    <li> THese work just like the name brand ones! I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the future. Such a money saver and they work just the same :)</li>
    <li> but not that bad either. . . still trying to decide if it&#x27;s worth the price difference, gut instinct says yes.</li>
    <li> For the price, these are great, and fit perfectly with my Clarisonic Mia (not sure why people said they didn&#x27;t fit?)  but they are little bit more rough than a Clarisonic brand head.  I bought the sensitive head, and i am totally fine with it.</li>
    <li> these are not the same, you get what you pay for here. I won&#x27;t buy them aging. You have to force them one and the vibration is not right.</li>
    <li> Just as good as my old clarisonic brush, but a MUCH better price! This seller has better generic brushes than others I have gotten in the past.</li>
    <li> What am I to do, make up night, nails, facials and all these things with the girly stuff, my daughter loves it....</li>
    <li> I love the price. I love a good deal. They fit just fine. But there is something about the texture that&#x27;s different from the overpriced ones. It&#x27;s a little rough, and I have sensitive skin, so I probably won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these by accident.  It wasn&#x27;t until they arrived that I realized they weren&#x27;t the Clarisonic brand.  But they fit my Clarisonic Mia just fine, and seemed to clean my skin just as well.  They seemed to last just as long (about three months) as the Clarisonic ones too.  Much cheaper than buying the actual Clarisonic ones, and just as effective.  A smart purchase and great value for sure.</li>
    <li> These did not work with my clarisonic... They would connect but brushes did not move.</li>
    <li> They are a bit rough on the face, but not too bothersome when used once a week.</li>
    <li> Love these generic brand replacement heads for my clarsonic.  They work perfectly and you would never know they are name brand.</li>
    <li> The middle part of the brush piece does not move. They seem a little more rough than the brand name heads but I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I expected a softer brush... It is not.  I recommend you go back to the drawing broad and &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; make them for &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the expensive brush heads. Fit great in my Clarasonic Mia 2.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. It fits in my Mia 2, but not cleaning and vibrating as original, not as effective as original. Waste of money. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 0 stars. It did not fit or work properly on my standard Clarisonic. I will use them to clean as they are not worth the cost of returning. Oh? I have to give some stars, so 1.</li>
    <li> works perfectly; I will never again purchase a cheaper &#x27;knock-off&#x27;</li>
    <li> Cannot beat this price. It is hard to differentiate between these and the official Clarisonic brushes. Work well and hold up.</li>
    <li> I purchased these thinking they would be just like the Clarisonic brand. They are difficult to screw on and don&#x27;t seem to vibrate as well. I would rather pay a bit more and get the real ones.</li>
    <li> I knew I took a gamble buying generic brush heads, but take my advice: DO NOT BUY THESE!</li>
    <li> I will order this product again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is good and not much difference in the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure but decided to try and no regret.</li>
    <li> This product looks and feels exactly like the clairsonic. I bought the sensitive one and its great. I had my mia since mothers day last year but after the brush wore out, i just didnt want to continue spending the cost of the replacement. Now I can get a total of 9 for the price I would pay for one replacement brush. That will last me over a year!!!</li>
    <li> No difference noticed between these and the 25 dollar ones from my esthetician. Same quality brush. Fits perfectly and works fine.</li>
    <li> The brush heads fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> Brushes not the same quality as clarasonic</li>
    <li> Too rough for being labelled sensitive however they were the same as the clarisonic ones.</li>
    <li> Great value for this product.</li>
    <li> Too soft. Did not fit perfectly either. Need to buy the brand name clarisonic</li>
