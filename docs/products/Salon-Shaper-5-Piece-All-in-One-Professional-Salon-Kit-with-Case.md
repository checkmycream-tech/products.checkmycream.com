      <li>Great...</li>
      <li>I can not express how happy I am to find this and at a great price.</li>
      <li>I was so happy when I found this product.</li>
      <li>This product is very nice, gave it to my girlfriend and was amazed.  </li>
      <li>so i didnt get what it shows in the picture but the product i got is really good and still use it to this day</li>
      <li>Worked just as expected,I used it to do my own nails</li>
      <li>was so glad I could obtain one on line.</li>
      <li>Do better with an emery board.</li>
      <li>I just love this</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
      <li>so I cant hurt myself :)</li>
      <li>It is a nice piece for light work.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I ordered another one, need i say more.</li>
      <li>Very powerful shaper with many tools and bag.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own acrylic nails and wanted to try this out, I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and just love it!</li>
      <li>I got a cheap knock-off.</li>
      <li>This is a cheap copy.  </li>
      <li>for people who enjoy spending time on nails.</li>
      <li>but it did not arrive in packaging just in flimsy cheap sandwich</li>
      <li>I have once already, and it has been very useful.</li>
      <li>I know this because I still have the original one.  </li>
      <li>This is not the original Salon Shaper that was advertised.  </li>
      <li>I would not buy this product from Amazon if you love the real Salon Shaper and are wanting to replace your trusty nail tool.</li>
      <li>We purchased a electric one and quickly returned it.</li>
      <li>but just right</li>
      <li>Having acrylic nails, it&#x27;s necessary for me to keep my nails clean, and the Salon Shaper makes this quick and easy.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use and came with a couple of different types of shapers.</li>
      <li>and it arrived very fast.</li>
      <li>This does exactly what I was hoping for.  </li>
      <li>The instructions were followed exactly and rendered pitiful results.</li>
      <li>The first one just wore out from use</li>
      <li>Having owned a Nail Shaper for years I discovered I was missing parts,so I ordered a new one and found it to be as good as when I first purchased one</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s compact and for running off of batteries it certainly has some power.  </li>
      <li>I am glad it is not super powerful</li>
      <li>After the debacle on Amz with the knock-off, I went to ebay and bought one that had a real picture of what I was receiving.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>On my real nails and the acrylics nails.</li>
      <li>real &amp;#34;SALON SHAPER&amp;#34</li>
      <li>and I use it so much it stop running</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for having this as I had been looking in all of the stores I went into.</li>
      <li>I live</li>
      <li>Had the other several years or more.</li>
      <li>My original one that I bought at a big box store back in 2004 just crapped out on me this summer...</li>
      <li>It is an old defective item, it does not have the Salon Shaper logo on it, it does not turn on after I put in new batteries in it, and I cannot put any of the the attachments inside at all to use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You will never get a professional manicure with this item.</li>
      <li>The motor is very weak, the packaging is cheap and it does not work nearly as well as the original.</li>
      <li>Try using a box and bubble wrap next time, not just a soft side envalope</li>
</ol>

<li> Try using a box and bubble wrap next time, not just a soft side envalope</li>
<li> and you can tell someone had this product for a long time</li>
<li> It wont run a long time anymore.</li>
<li> This item has been used by someone else that has had it for a long time.  </li>
<li> Plain and simple.</li>
<li> I am not satisfied at all with your service, I have ordered a Salon Shaper before and never had any problems whatsoever until the motor ran out recently.  </li>
<li> It has the power you need for filing fake and real nails.</li>
<li> ; is 5stars, hands down... but knock-offs... zero stars.</li>
<li> It works as it pleases and you may find yourself with a half manicure.</li>
<li> I opened the package and I see they are not a true salon shaper like it shows in the photo</li>
<li> Save your money and buy the little foam nail files / polishers.</li>
<li> I am not satisfied at all and will put this in the comments section on every part I can on this Amazon site and beyond about this company and any other website.  </li>
<li> I had one for a few years and it broke so</li>
<li> My son dropped mine a few minutes ago</li>
<li> The attachments do not fit snugly in the tool allowing them to fall out or wobble quite a bit when in use.  </li>
<li> This is a total rip off and is useless for trimming nails.</li>
<li> My husbands uses it on his thick nails.</li>
<li> Also the fake salon shapers I received were bet all up and mangled.</li>
<li> When I opened the package it was dirty looking</li>
<li> But this was a bad buy, I wont buy from these sellers again.</li>
<li> Disappointed.  </li>
<li> , I call that false advertising!!!</li>
<li> and they look like crap.</li>
<li> This product is terrible.</li>
<li> SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
<li> WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> for people who enjoy spending time on nails.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I found this product. I had one just like it and it lasted over 5 years before it quit working. I can not express how happy I am to find this and at a great price. I would definitely buy from you again. and it arrived very fast.Thank you so much for having this as I had been looking in all of the stores I went into. which none of them had it.</li>
    <li> Having owned a Nail Shaper for years I discovered I was missing parts,so I ordered a new one and found it to be as good as when I first purchased one</li>
    <li> I have once already, and it has been very useful. I don&#x27; t need to get any mani, I just keep my nails in perfect shape whith this!</li>
    <li> This does exactly what I was hoping for.  It&#x27;s compact and for running off of batteries it certainly has some power.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something along these. lines.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. Save your money and buy the little foam nail files / polishers. The instructions were followed exactly and rendered pitiful results.</li>
    <li> I had one for a few years and it broke so was so glad I could obtain one on line.</li>
    <li> This is the second Salon Shaper I&#x27;ve ordered - now I have one for home and one for travel.  Having acrylic nails, it&#x27;s necessary for me to keep my nails clean, and the Salon Shaper makes this quick and easy.  It&#x27;s also great for buffing, and works on toenails, too.</li>
    <li> This product is very nice, gave it to my girlfriend and was amazed.  comes as seen in the photo, I&#x27;m pleased.  Greetings.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned. The first one just wore out from use so I needed a replacement. Would recommend this to anyone for personnel use.</li>
    <li> It is a nice piece for light work.  Just follow instructions and it will do the job.</li>
    <li> This is not the original Salon Shaper that was advertised.  I know this because I still have the original one.  This is a cheap copy.  The motor is very weak, the packaging is cheap and it does not work nearly as well as the original. Even the cloth pouch it comes in is a cheaper material. This is a total rip off and is useless for trimming nails. Don&#x27;t throw your money away.  Do not buy this junk!</li>
    <li> I just love this I had one i got at one of my store were I live and I use it so much it stop running</li>
    <li> The attachments do not fit snugly in the tool allowing them to fall out or wobble quite a bit when in use.  I would not purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I have recieved an item I purchased today.  It is an old defective item, it does not have the Salon Shaper logo on it, it does not turn on after I put in new batteries in it, and I cannot put any of the the attachments inside at all to use.  This item has been used by someone else that has had it for a long time.  I am not satisfied at all with your service, I have ordered a Salon Shaper before and never had any problems whatsoever until the motor ran out recently.  When I opened the package it was dirty looking and you can tell someone had this product for a long time, the box is a a bit worn, and I should have known when they had the audacity to not include the owners manual with the product I have purchased.  I am not satisfied at all and will put this in the comments section on every part I can on this Amazon site and beyond about this company and any other website.  When you close it to lock it, it keeps turning because something inside is worn out.  Will never purchase from this company again!!!!!!  SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Do better with an emery board.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own acrylic nails and wanted to try this out, I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and just love it! And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Worked just as expected,I used it to do my own nails and it worked! I am glad it is not super powerful but just right so I cant hurt myself :)</li>
    <li> Everything was there but it did not arrive in packaging just in flimsy cheap sandwich baggie.&lt;br /&gt;When I put batteries in it, it worked but the attacment kept coming out.&lt;br /&gt;I had one of these i bought in the store before and it was great. I lost it and wanted to replace it. But this was a bad buy, I wont buy from these sellers again.</li>
    <li> Well I received my so called salon shapers, I only waited a month. I opened the package and I see they are not a true salon shaper like it shows in the photo, I call that false advertising!!! Also the fake salon shapers I received were bet all up and mangled. I bought them as a gift and they look like crap. Who packed this stuff anyway? Try using a box and bubble wrap next time, not just a soft side envalope MORON!!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and came with a couple of different types of shapers.Great for beginners who aren&#x27;t used to this type of tool</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money!&lt;br /&gt;You will never get a professional manicure with this item. It works as it pleases and you may find yourself with a half manicure.</li>
    <li> Very good for nails. My husbands uses it on his thick nails. Very powerful shaper with many tools and bag.</li>
    <li> I had one of these, and after YEARS of service, it just finally died.  I ordered another one, need i say more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine over 6 years. I love it. We purchased a electric one and quickly returned it. It could not stand up to the salon sharper. It has the power you need for filing fake and real nails. My son dropped mine a few minutes ago, I guess that&#x27;s was its last fall. It wont run a long time anymore. Try one, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> so i didnt get what it shows in the picture but the product i got is really good and still use it to this day</li>
    <li> Its works like it said it would. On my real nails and the acrylics nails. I would recomment it great price.</li>
    <li> Purchase arrived well within the  ETA and was received as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great... My second purchase.  Had the other several years or more.</li>
    <li> I did not receive the actual &amp;#34;TeleBrands&amp;#34; Salon Shaper as pictured. I got a cheap knock-off. I would not buy this product from Amazon if you love the real Salon Shaper and are wanting to replace your trusty nail tool. My original one that I bought at a big box store back in 2004 just crapped out on me this summer... I use it regularly every couple weeks and I had to replace it. After the debacle on Amz with the knock-off, I went to ebay and bought one that had a real picture of what I was receiving.&lt;br /&gt;The real &amp;#34;SALON SHAPER&amp;#34; is 5stars, hands down... but knock-offs... zero stars. Crappy motor, crappy construction... knock-off quality. Plain and simple.</li>
