<li> The tins are perfect little stocking stuffers, I&#x27;ve been giving them to my tween and teen grandkids the past few years, they use it on their cheeks and hands during cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and it lasts surprisingly long.</li>

<li> ; I try to buy all my products organic or natural to eliminate chemicals/toxins from my life, but for the price and long-standing reputation, Nivea hits the mark on everything: thick, luxurious feel that can be used for hands/face, and it stays hydrated.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way and it lasts forever.  </li>
<li> I keep going back to this nivea, small compact for the pocket...</li>
<li> After using this for a week I started to see extreme differences in the dryness of my face as well as my breakouts.</li>
<li> I got a small 99 cent tin for dry winter hands</li>
<li> One thing you may notice, though, the lids are not always tight, so I keep them in a snack size baggie when carrying them around, in case it accidentally opens up.  </li>
<li> This helps my dry hard feet.</li>
<li> I bought this little can of Nivea crème to replace one I carry in my purse.  </li>
<li> Small and fits.</li>
<li> It is a heavy moisturizer which worried me as I have sensitive dry/oily skin and am prone to bad breakouts.</li>
<li> So cant complaint.</li>
<li> Less expensive here than at drug store.  </li>
<li> I was also wrong.</li>
<li> Very irritating to the skin.</li>
<li> One container opened up in shipping and made an awful mess.  </li>
<li> At the prices offered on Amazon you can not go wrong!!</li>
<li> This stuff is horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Nivea is a great moisturizing  creme.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. After buying high end moisturizers from Sephora along with beauty face oils and testing so many products out this is the one!! It is a heavy moisturizer which worried me as I have sensitive dry/oily skin and am prone to bad breakouts. After using this for a week I started to see extreme differences in the dryness of my face as well as my breakouts. I use it in the mornings and before bed after washing my face. I didn&#x27;t think it would work well under make up however on that point I was also wrong. This is my go to moisturizer now for all day and all night. At the prices offered on Amazon you can not go wrong!!</li>
    <li> The creme itself is wonderful, moisturizers dry skin well, absorbs well, too, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily residue.  It also has a nice, light scent, so anyone, young or old, can use it, it won&#x27;t interfere with scents you wear.  I use it on my young grandson as his body creme, on my feet after a shower.  The tins are perfect little stocking stuffers, I&#x27;ve been giving them to my tween and teen grandkids the past few years, they use it on their cheeks and hands during cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these little tins, they make taking Nivea Creme with you so easy, I keep one in my bag wherever I go.  For around $1 a tin, (I don&#x27;t pay more), it&#x27;s a great deal.  *One thing you may notice, though, the lids are not always tight, so I keep them in a snack size baggie when carrying them around, in case it accidentally opens up.  Otherwise, all is good!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for decades and my mum and grandma before me. It is a perfect creme for cold weather. i usually put on my gel-creme moisturizer first and the my nivea as a cold-defense during the weather. My skin is thanking me every day. It also works great as a make-up remover and a night creme. It&#x27;s just great over all. there is a reason why this product has been on the shelves, unchanged, for over 100 years!!!</li>
    <li> So these are like $2-3 at Target. 89 cents on Amazon?! WIN! Love it for my car. Small and fits. Even in my purse or for travel.</li>
    <li> Love this little container. Maybe that&#x27;s why I buy the Nivea--because of the container. I do like Nivea, however.</li>
    <li> I used tons of moisturizers but I can&#x27;t let go of Nivea original creme I use it on my body, feet, and sometimes face. This product never failed me and for its price it&#x27;s a necessity in every home.</li>
    <li> Fabulous.  Really effective on heels of feet.  Better than products developed for dry, cracked heels.  Love the travel size.  Less expensive here than at drug store.  This is now a regular purchase.  NOTE:  Please package better for shipping.  One container opened up in shipping and made an awful mess.  That&#x27;s why I gave four stars.</li>
    <li> Not heavy or oily on skin...great under makeup.  After use skin is smooth and visable age lines are reduced. Great!</li>
    <li> Great to keep in your bag when you&#x27;re on the go - and it&#x27;s fine for traveling.</li>
    <li> Got it quick and as described.</li>
    <li> I like Nivea, it is a great moisturizer for me. I Apply to my face and hands and knees to keep it moist. I prefer the smaller size because it is portable, easy to use.</li>

    <li> Love having one of these in my purse and in my car!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite some time. This helps my dry hard feet. Plus you Can use the 1 oz can in a purse. And use the larger jar to refill it!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible. It&#x27;s now made in Mexico. Very irritating to the skin. I would give it zero if I could.</li>
    <li> Great as always, absorbs fast</li>
    <li> Love this cream, small and easy to carry in purse. I keep several around.</li>
    <li> perfect on the go. in your purse. i have dry skin so i always use nivea.</li>

    <li> Always like Nivea products. So cant complaint. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love nivea creme; I try to buy all my products organic or natural to eliminate chemicals/toxins from my life, but for the price and long-standing reputation, Nivea hits the mark on everything: thick, luxurious feel that can be used for hands/face, and it stays hydrated. The small tins are easy to carry, so I recommend it for travel</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. Fits nicely in your purse &amp; is perfect for the wintertime when my hands start to dry out. It is also helpful to put an order over $25 for free shipping.</li>
    <li> this is a good product but for the price the package could be bigger (way bigger).... overall status is ok..</li>
    <li> Newsflash: These are $1 for 1 ounce at drugstores. Check out any national chain&#x27;s online offerings--CVS, Walgreens. Not $5, $1.</li>
    <li> Perfect, creamy goodness for your bag when you&#x27;re in a pinch! Great when you&#x27;re feeling a bit dried out! :)</li>
    <li> Great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;good for using on hands&lt;br /&gt;not for faces, it is too oily for my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> i used it once and i think it works well but the sent was VERY strong, like a rose or something. reminds me of what an 80+ grandmother might smell like.  i simply could not use it because of the smell.  it says unisex but for you men out there i would steer clear. find something truly unscented.</li>
    <li> Hand cream that truely protects the skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this little can of Nivea crème to replace one I carry in my purse.  A little bit goes a long way and it lasts forever.  The little can is very light weight and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
    <li> Nivea is a brand we use constantly in our home. This particular product is great to throw inside of your purse or pocket for when you need it. This doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue and moisturizes well.</li>
