      <li>This set is a great way to try Philosophy products.</li>
      <li>Great kit to have.</li>
      <li>Great for traveling</li>
      <li>Nice products.</li>
      <li>And the shampoo/ gel smells nice.</li>
      <li>this is a nice way of reminding them that I love to have them over :-)</li>
      <li>I love this product, but.....</li>
      <li>I feel it would be even better if it came in a pouch instead of being lose.</li>
      <li>great products fast shipping</li>
      <li>The rest are fine.</li>
      <li>&amp; I know my daughter will enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I wanted some decent travel-sized accessories for when I was going to have surgery and be in the hospital for a couple days, and this package had everything I needed at a reasonable price and with some quality stuff, nice scents!</li>
      <li>Worth the $</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to giving these as bathroom sets for guests but due to being packed loosely, many bottles had spilled and ruined most of the packaging of soap boxes, making them unacceptable to give.  </li>
      <li>This is a really nice set with several different philosophy products.</li>
      <li>I originally had a problem with this order, personal preference really.</li>
      <li>The body wash, which was the main item I wanted, had spilled and soaked the paper around the bar soap.</li>
      <li>I ordered a few of these for my guest bathroom and love them .</li>
      <li>The back of the product reads, &amp;#34;these are to enjoy during your stay.&amp;#34; Definitely not legal.</li>
      <li>I often have friends stay for the weekend and in case someone forgot to bring their toiletries or stays longer unexpectedly</li>
      <li>However, I guess I should have expected that when it said &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34;, right?  </li>
      <li>A little better packaging could have prevented a lot of wasted product.</li>

    <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to giving these as bathroom sets for guests but due to being packed loosely, many bottles had spilled and ruined most of the packaging of soap boxes, making them unacceptable to give.  At a minimum, liquids need to be shipped separate from the soaps.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I originally had a problem with this order, personal preference really. I had done a review and was helped promptly, and I wasn&#x27;t even asking for help. My &#x27;problem&#x27; was actually taken cared of. This seller actually cared about customer and went out of their way to remedy the problem. Thank you!</li>
