<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great! Got plenty of compliments. A teacher thought it was alcohol but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne, so glad to be able to get for my husband on-line hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> My third purchase in 4 months and it smells better every time. Suits both office and social occasions.</li>
    <li> Well, it smells nice once you put it on!! But it does not last for 5 miinutes! But For the price it is cheap but, you pay for what you get!</li>
    <li> Best smell ever! Smells a little of sandalwood, vanilla and earthy. Not overpowering, I just love it! Great price and arrived on time. Nice packaging, was handled with care. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Have you ever feel like you you don&#x27;t have the men appeal , well my friends this intimatly by Beckham is what you been waiting for , it has this especial fragrance of freshness, very appealing, when you walk by females they will most certainly turn their head , it gives you confidence, so be aware of that animal inside of you being realese by yes intimatly Beckham</li>
    <li> Bought before. Husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> i love this cologne! the price is a REALLY wake up call aswell, if you go to like Macy&#x27;s or Kohl&#x27;s, its like $60 bucks there. i mean it smells GREAT im gonna order another one lol!.</li>
    <li> Nice scent but doesn&#x27;t last too long and also after i received my package it was tester bottle and a little bit disappointed but i can say it is worth for this price ... Beckham Intimately  smells pretty nice ...</li>
    <li> A quality masculine blend of spices, woods, and light cinnamon-nutmeg accord that is great to wear at night.  Not really original but very good quality nonetheless.  Not so much a daily wearer but can be factored into one&#x27;s fragrance rotation, even during the day.</li>
    <li> Me and my wife love the way this colone smells, my only complaint is that it only lasts about 3-4 hrs, MAX.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this fragrance for my husband for several years.  It&#x27;s a light spicy oriental with good staying power and not overwhelming.  An elegant fragrance.  One I find affordable as well.  Used to be you could find \\&quot;Intimately Beckham\\&quot; at drug stores.  Not anymore.  It is one of my favorite scents on my husband.  One I take the time to stop and smell on him when he wears it.  I&#x27;ve been guilty of wearing it myself, though I don&#x27;t wear it in public or find it a feminine fragrance.  Just in private because I enjoy it that much.  I prefer it to many of the more expense department fragrances that I buy for my husband that are three to four times the price.</li>
    <li> Waste perfume. Very old stick.. not lasting for more than 30min. In summer, I would recommend not to buy this or from the amazon seller. This brand is great however it not right place to buy.</li>
    <li> After having ordered this as a gift for my son, who stole my original smaller bottle, when it arrived and he opened it as a late christmas present, he turns to me and says &amp;#34;dad, now I can smell like a million bucks everyday at work.&amp;#34; Apparently Mr Beckham knows how to impress the kids in this day and age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So knowing that a teenager has approved of this, how can you NOT purchase it?</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000VOJHE0 Intimately Beckham By Beckham For Men, Eau De Toilette Spray, 2.5-Ounce Bottle]] This fragrance morphs as it develops. What a lot of people are saying \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t last\\&quot; is just the more citrus topnotes (grapefruit, bergamot) evaporating and the more complex wood and musk notes intermingling and settling in. Your nose becomes accustomed to them so you think there is no fragrance left, but those around you can still smell it. (It&#x27;s called olfactory fatigue or anosmia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this fragrance. I like its depth and subtle use of spices and dirty musk, and a certain rubbery quality it has. What I DON&#x27;T like is one of the synthetic wood notes that has been hanging around in men&#x27;s fragrances since the 80s; I think it&#x27;s a synthetic vetivert or something. There is just a little of it, so I am able to get past it, but I wish it were absent. What I DO like is the creamy smooth edgeless sandalwood-cedar feel that follows a guy who is wearing it. That&#x27;s why I bought it, because of how it smelled on someone else after he had put it on hours earlier. So you guys who say it doesn&#x27;t last, don&#x27;t take guido baths in your fragrances and you&#x27;re better off.</li>
    <li> Very Good cologne, my crush could not get enough of me whenever I used it, honestly she could not get her hands off me! I mean she did like me before, but this definitely added to the mix, a real turn on. This cologne lasts a long time maybe even several days in conditions like Eastern Washington where its cold and dry in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.</li>
    <li> i love this scent it is probably the best smelling cologne ive ever worn ... and i love the great prices on amazon !!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this scent. It&#x27;s not too heavy and lasts a long time. I think each person is individual and depending upon how it mixes with your body, it will smell different. Great deal for the price!</li>
    <li> Very spicy, strong scent. It&#x27;s one that people will notice. It&#x27;s very unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is that when I went to the club one night and hugged one of my girl friends, she said, \\&quot;You smell sexy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a more subtle, clean scent, try Beckham Instinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Beckham colognes smell like high-end cologne but it&#x27;s at a value price. I have tried 3 different colognes in his line and love them all.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got me this cologne and I was very surprised at how good it smelled. It wasn&#x27;t too pungent and she loves it. Highly recommended. :P</li>
    <li> i love this perfume! it smells like a man, which is a good thing.. i hate those fruity smells on guys, and this is anything but fruity. it&#x27;s strong and nice and very masculine. also, this is a great deal as i have just paid $60 for it at kohl&#x27;s :(</li>
    <li> Fine mix of essences. Extremely pleasant aroma. A standout among the many baroque and intense scents for men.</li>
    <li> (My name is Chloe and im using my boyfriends account by the way)This Cologne is awesome! I bought some for my boyfriend and received it in the mail a few days ago. It smells so clean and like a cologne should smell. I love this stuff on him. You have to buy this stuff! The only draw back I have with the cologne is that it should be a bigger bottle but let me tell you alittle cologne goes along away!</li>
    <li> Background fragrance but noticed by others.  A modernized version of English Leather, lasts about 8 hours, you will be extremely pleased by this product.  I wonder if Spice girl had anything to do with tne different notes that make up this scent.  Nice packinging with magnitized cap that covers the spray.</li>
    <li> I tried for the first time on amazon to use the review of previous buyers,sorry it didn&#x27;t help out,who the hell in the world will give a perfume like this five stars,i waited anxiously for it to get to Nigeria and this became the worst product i have ever shopped for on amazon,very useless perfume,doesn&#x27;t last ,smell like an Arabian pef,just forget it,it is terrible,if Beckham himself wears this pef during his playing years,it would create a negative luck for him towards scoring goals,this is the first product I am reviewing in all my years of shopping at amazon,prospects,please try something else.&lt;br /&gt;OLABISI</li>
    <li> Love this cologne, smells good on me.  I have worn this for about 7yrs now and still enjoy the sent.</li>
    <li> If you use this, when you are close to a girl, you are always in charge, trust me! Its the perfect fragrance</li>
    <li> This fragance its very nice!</li>
    <li> I like the scent.  Don&#x27;t usually wear cologne but this is a nice smell.  It does not last too long but I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Best smelling cologne I have ever owned so different and all the girls love it.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely delicious and unique. Most colognes bore me, this one is fascinating.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the price was awesome. I got the women&#x27;s for my wife also and it was just as good .</li>
    <li> I love the way this cologne smells on my boyfriend. Every time he runs out i get him more. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been wearing this cologne since a little after we started dating in 2008... everytime I smell it it is like it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m smelling it because I love it just as much every time. It truly smells so good. There is really no good way to describe the scent, so buy it for the great price and check it out yourself! The prices on amazon are great compared to when they used to sell it in stores for like triple the price. This cologne just smells like for lack of better words like, MAN! It makes you feel like cozy and warm and has great tones of various flavors all man smells, but with a hint of a sweet scent as well, but only just a hint. It&#x27;s a strong smell, but seems that this eau de toilette is definitely nto as long lasting as the eau de parfum used to be but it&#x27;s rarely available anymore&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely suggest this cologne to any guy, or a great gift for a girl to buy their boyfriend/fiance/husband.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes i&#x27;ll spray it on a sweatshirt or somethign of mine, because of how great it smells, but i wouldnt wear it out of the house if you were a girl because again, it is a masculine scent, but a great one at that!</li>
    <li> I am giving two stars because the price was cheap and the delivery was fast. Because my brother in-law loved the smell, I bought 3 of the item. Unfortunately, it turned out that they were not the original Beckhams. Oh well, I have learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy. My husband wears it everyday.</li>
    <li> I first ordered this product on the reviews and when I got it delivery was very very fast. When my husband put it on I can&#x27;t believe  how great it smelt. Grown and sexy love it... Thanks for the great product and the super quick delivery.</li>
    <li> this definetley has a nice scent.  kinda smokey kinda mysterious.  Should cost more than what you pay but I can tell why it&#x27;s less expensive and it&#x27;s just because the scent fades quick.  It does leave a nice deep scent on your skin however.  I don&#x27;t wear it much in summer as it&#x27;s more earthy and feels like a scent for the fall but it&#x27;s sexy and makes you feel like wearing a nice leather jacket.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. My girlfriend loves this scent. This is my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Awsome product , smells good and ships fast</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;It was a gift for my boyfriend, he loved it.&lt;br /&gt;So much cheaper than department stores.</li>
    <li> WOW!!! I was shocked when I bought this cologne.  I was not expecting for this to smell as good as it does...  This is clearly in my top five colognes right now.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Go Get It!!!</li>
    <li> I had this one other time, but I couldn&#x27;t remember where I got it. Was surfing around and came up with it. It was cheaper too. Its what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product before, but have to say, this is a very sexy scent.  At least I love smelling it on my fiance who&#x27;s been wearing it for several years now.  Top notes are grapefruit, bergamot and cardamom; middle notes are nutmeg, violet and star anise; base notes are sandalwood, amber and patchouli.  It&#x27;s very sexy and intoxicating!</li>
    <li> Has a sweet but not overpowering smell! This is my second bottle and I am still geting compliments on how I smell.</li>
    <li> Looking for a good cologne can be challenging, since I can only smell about four to five different fragrances before they start blending together. However, this one stood out for me when I tested it in a store and I have thoroughly enjoyed wearing it ever since. In fact, I&#x27;d go so far as to say this is my favorite eau de toilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure everyone smells something different in it, but for me it has a bit of a spicy smell with a hint of pine or cedar and a vanilla undertone. I have received compliments on it, so I know it&#x27;s not just me that enjoys the scent. I couldn&#x27;t say how long it lasts for sure, since I generally become accustomed to a fragrance I&#x27;m wearing fairly quickly, but I&#x27;ve been told it stays with me through an evening. My one complaint is the bottle shape &amp; size is a bit bulky for taking with me in a toiletry bag. Still, this is a great fragrance to have and one I&#x27;d certainly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a Christmas present for my brother and he absolutely loved the gift. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the super low pricing!  This is a great scent.  The bottle looks good, and I hope it doesn&#x27;t stop being produced.</li>
    <li> A rather unpleasant &amp; short lived (thank goodness for that!) smell. Reminds me of what most Arabs I knew wore when we were living in the middle-east. A bit cloying &amp; nauseating (sic!) - definitely no class.&lt;br /&gt;Spend your moolah on worthwhile stuff - maybe something in the Adidas range (Deep Energy, Victory League, Dynamic Pulse ...), they all smell a million times better &amp; are cheap to boot (not much last power though)!</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume. It is a lot different from others, It is masculine and men will stand out wearing this one.</li>
    <li> I really  like this, it&#x27;s not heavy, kinda light and a tad musky. The scent did last for about a couple hours. I would reccomend this fragrance for a younger man however.</li>
    <li> received this as a gift several years ago and loved it.since it is no longer sold in stores i found it on amazon.shipped fast i would and have recommended this to several people.would most likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This, for the price, is a good product.  It is not as concentrated as the bottles you can buy for 70 or 80 dollars as apparent by the lighter color.  It has been watered down, but still has a strong scent and lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> Great! And quick delivery</li>
    <li> This scent made my eyes water, it was so strong; and I couldn&#x27;t make out any fragrance notes.  I feel it&#x27;s too strong for daytime use, and far too unpleasant for evening.  Not at all what I expected, having read other reviews.</li>
    <li> I really love this cologne. It is hard to find due to the fact that it is discontinued item. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> Smells like the time that raccoon got stuck in the copier.</li>
    <li> Took a shot stuffs bad smells like aged kindergarten teacher</li>
    <li> I was a fan of Beckham&#x27;s Instinct and use that fragrance during the spring/summer months. I decided to give another men&#x27;s fragrance on his line a go, so I chose this.  It is a warm, spicy, masculine scent with a dominant amber and sandalwood at its base. Its longevity is very satisfactory and I have actually received more compliments than I would have guessed for this one.  Wear it for casual occasions, it is not particularly pungent and does not have a strong sillage, but when someone gets closer to you I assure you they will be pleased. I stress, if this is your first time buying fragrances online instead of retail, buy this product from Amazon LLC. instead of a third party seller and you will receive an authentic, factory sealed, shipped in bubble wrap, fragrance well worth its price.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wears this cologne and I love it. It is subtle and yummy. It does last longer then what some people are saying. When my guy puts it on (and he does not use a lot), I can smell it on him all day.</li>
