<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> First off this soap is alittle expensive now. I bought mine when it was 19.99 for 4 bars and ive seen it go up to 29.99 for 4 bars. people do research on cheaper prices i would not go past 20.00 if i were you!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways I have been using this product off and on since April. I used to work at zoo so i have really uneven farmers tans on my arms and legs. I can honestly say that i am completely even on my legs and my arms are almost there. Although it made me even on my legs it didnt fade my scars away completely .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does make your skin glow! i use this in conjunction to melted raw african shea butter and my skin is sooooo gorgeous now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;*If you are african american and trying to become lightskined this is not the product for you. This soap just takes you natural birth color and it evens you out .&lt;br /&gt;* I used two bars and then i switched to the honey and black seed soap by nubian heritage and then i used the other two bars. i dont know if using these two soaps combined helped extra but it feels like it did!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great for uneven skin tones. because help lighten them with in a month. better to take a before and after picture of ourself so we can be able to notice the results.. also great for people like me that wax our armpit, Because I was able to see more whitening in that area. I was able to see also that is great for greasy skin and acne prone. This helps a lot!</li>
    <li> It works! Worth buying! I really love it. Good price...  fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Kojie Sans is an absolutely amazing product! I ordered a pack of 4 earlier this year and I&#x27;m on my 4th bar of soap. The first and second bars removed scars and lightened my complexion but overtime, I didn&#x27;t see any more improvement in my complexion. I just ordered a pack of 8 because even though I&#x27;ve stopped getting lighter, my skin is getting fresher and has a certain glow to it. I dont use a lightening cream with the product, I use Jergens ultra healing cream maybe that&#x27;s why. The soap smells really nice also. This sellers shipping is super fast! For my second order, shipping cost was twice cos I ordered x2 quantity and that&#x27;s a downside to it.&lt;br /&gt;It also works great against pimples and acne...I&#x27;ve been pimple-free since I started using it and all the black spots I had on my face are completely GONE! Even though I&#x27;m not getting any lighter now, my skin is more evenly toned and I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I saw pass on this soap. I used it for four months and never saw a difference in my skin tone nor did any blemishes go away.</li>
    <li> it seemed to work but i got lots of acne while using it, so weigh pros and cons</li>
    <li> Awesome soap. Starts&lt;br /&gt;Working in about 2-3 weeks!!</li>
    <li> This product is a plus for managing mild to moderate acne. It tends to lighten your skin gradually but overall it will give your skin a better , clear complexion!</li>
    <li> I love this company. Key2vitality this Is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered from them and have received everything in a timely fashion.  Alright The soap is SOOO Much bigger then ths last 3bars I had and, I paid the same price foe three bars at 65oz . Now I have four bars at 135oz. For only 17.70 with shipping !!! Happy customer: )</li>
    <li> I am a 27 year old caucasian female with an &amp;#34;olive&amp;#34; skin tone. I have dark hair and eyes and my skin is white as a snowflake in the winter and a golden brown in the summer. I have umpteen issues with my skin and these include: eczema, milia, acne, and sensitivities to ingredients in all kinds of beauty care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this soap on a daily basis. I washed all over my face and body once a day as though I were using any other kind of soap, i.e. I didn&#x27;t let the soap &amp;#34;sink in;&amp;#34; I just washed it off as if I were using it solely for cleansing purposes. I followed using the moisturizing cream that I&#x27;ve always used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks of this daily use, this is how my skin reacted:&lt;br /&gt;1.) My face and shoulders broke out with large zits that I&#x27;ve never dealt with before.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Some areas that are more prone to dry skin (hands and where my arms bend) became very itchy and red.&lt;br /&gt;2.) My skin lightened dramatically. How do I know this? I have a large tattoo on my upper-arm and within that tattoo I have visible parts of un-inked skin. Within this period of time, that un-inked skin went from a very dark and kind of dirty-looking complexion, to a beautiful and bright pale color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the acne and dry skin issues, I have decided to use this soap solely on my, ahem, intimate areas. I have been doing this for several weeks and the outcome is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1.) My downstairs no longer has razor-burn and the color is much prettier than before.&lt;br /&gt;2.) My nipples and areolas have gone from a brown color to a pink color. They are also extra-sensitive to the touch at all times of the day and almost always hard.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on continuing the daily use in my special lady parts because I like these effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, this does lighten skin. It works. If that is what you are hoping to achieve, I highly recommend it. However, you should be cautious and patient with your usage, ESPECIALLY if you have sensitive skin like mine. Don&#x27;t overdo it. I would suggest to use it once every couple days to see how your skin reacts and either increase or decrease your amount of use accordlingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its smell, I personally don&#x27;t smell anything. In addition, I think a single bar of soap lasts quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and I hope my imput helps.</li>
    <li> Not really sure if it works, but I love the smell. It also gives me the feeling of being squeaky clean:)</li>
    <li> Good deal great razors.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if it evens out my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap for my acne !!!!!! Clears everything up removes stubborn spots. If you suffer from acne this soap will definitely&lt;br /&gt;help your skin. It exfoliates very well.</li>
    <li> It cleans well l love the smell it also helps fade dark acne scars. I have been using this soap for about six months and I see a definite improvement in my overall skin tone.</li>
    <li> Coz I really like kojie..that&#x27;s my soap for everyday! It&#x27;s so amazing soap! I luv to use it everyday. Tnx kojie.</li>
    <li> It works but it takes time. It wont lighten you a good shade if you do not use a lightening cream with it.</li>
    <li> This soap was garbage. It did nothing for my face except make me break out more than i already break out and dry out my skin. I&#x27;ve tried all types of soap for my skin and what i&#x27;ve found works the best is just plain water. now my acne is very minimum. also this soap melts in the shower super fast... dont buy it. also it doesnt lighten your face...what a waste.</li>
    <li> I used this product daily all over my face and body for over four months. This was my second purchase, the first time I purchased on eBay and because it was not effective after 1 month I thought it make have been a counterfeit product, so I purchased it again here on Amazon. I have medium brown Indian skin and bought it to reduce dark marks in the underarm/bikini area and also on my face. I also hoped that it would help some light hyperpigmentation on my legs from ingrown hairs and prevent new ones from forming with vigorous almost daily exfoliation. Unfortunately I found that this product made no difference in my skin at all. I did not even feel a tingle, no matter how long I left it on, and I have very sensitive skin. The one thing I noticed that might attest for its strength was little red bumps on my face and chest that went away after about half an hour. The smell was pleasant and it worked well as a regular soap, but didn&#x27;t work as expected. My skin remained the same colour all over and I experienced no dryness or peeling or sensitivity. I would still recommend trying this product as it is inexpensive and has received very many positive reviews.</li>
    <li> It clears skin. For me it worked.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my niece.  She really loves it.  And then I (male) used it.  And I like it.  Yes it makes the skin extra, extra, extra dry, but not only I, but everyone around me noticed the change in my color.  (No, I did not exactly become a white dude, lol!).  This thing really works!  Check it out folks!!!</li>
    <li> Lightening my shin two shades within a month. A tad bit drying though but nothing a great moisturizer can&#x27;t fix.. I apply the foam on my skin for 10 minutes before washing off. Works faster than any thing I ever tried.</li>
    <li> The soap worked great, I used it in the shower for the whole body, I just wish the soap was bigger so that it would last longer, but it lightened my skin as a whole and faded blemishes.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it&#x27;s intended for but leaves skin dry and harsh on your face but it&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t remedy with lotion or cream</li>
    <li> This soap is by far the best soap i wish it came bigger and little cheaper&lt;br /&gt;But i love it</li>
    <li> I read some reviews that say that they saw results on Acne scars after two or three days of using the soap but it wasn&#x27;t as fast for me. It took about two weeks of daily use before I started noticing the difference but it&#x27;s a hell of a lot more convenient than home remedies that I&#x27;ve been trying for years.</li>
    <li> It is just a soap, nothing more nothing less. Save your money and find a good natural scrub (sugar cane mixed with olive oil work wonders for me).</li>
    <li> Burn my face bad first two weeks it was like magic soap then useing for 2months my face look dark dirty it was super dry and just hurt so bad It took 3 weeks to get my skin back to normal I will NOT buy this soap again.</li>
    <li> It didn´t worked for me at all I am really disappointed. At first, I had high expectations from this product but, I was so wrong. I just bought it because of all these amazing reviews but it didn´t worked for me unfortunately. The only good thing of this product is how it smells like tangerine.</li>
    <li> This maybe a little TMI for some people, but I want everyone to know how well this product worked for me. Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;ve used every skin lightening, dark spot brightening, whitening product you can imagine. From the high end retailers in Nordstrom to my local Walmart aisle. I&#x27;ve tried every last one of them, and not one of the products I purchased there have worked as quickly or as thoroughly as this soap bar. I have to confess that I am not the most patient person you will ever come across, nor am I the most diligent, but let me tell you this is by far the easiest and most inexpensive way to brighten even the most uneven skintone area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reasons I purchased this product was for my inner thighs and dark eye circles. As a kid playing sports in the summer heat, I always seemed to suffer from dreadful inner thigh chafing. I never actually noticed the dark blemishes they left behind until about a year ago. That is when I went on a skin brightening frenzy. I wanted them gone and I wanted them gone immediately. I had always had dark eye circles and purchased everything my dermatologist recommended. They worked, but not as quickly as I wanted. Because of this I knew what to purchase and what to avoid for my new found skin disorder &amp;#34;dark inner thigh areas&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product by pure chance roaming amazon products, and I am so glad I did! I have been using this lightening soap everyday consecutively for almost 2 weeks now (morning/ night) and it has worked miracles! My dark circles are completely gone! I have the most even skintone I have ever had now. As for my dreadful dark inner thigh areas they are also completely cleared up now! I know that previous products would have worked had I continued with them for a couple of months, but did I mention that I am not the least bit patient?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, do steer clear. This product drys up the skin like no other product I&#x27;ve used before, but theorganic coconut oil I use afterwards makes all the difference. Many people are complaining about the sting they get while using the soap , but I&#x27;m guessing that it only means it is working. Also, one word SUNBLOCK, SUNBLOCK, SUNBLOCK....and SUNBLOCK. It is a must. I don&#x27;t know if this will work as well for other people as it did for me, but I highly recommend it. Hence the five stars. I got the 4 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I almost forgot about the TMI portion... as I was lightening my inner thigh areas it seemed to also lighten other areas as well...</li>
    <li> The soap is good, it works but slowly (better than not working at all). Over the past few months that I&#x27;ve used this product, I have seen a great change in my skin (underarms) lighten. It looks a lot lighter than before. Also, one of the changes I made after I started using this product was, I switched from regularly shaving my underarms to waxing which helped a lot in lightening my skin. I have also used the soap on my knees to lighten that area on my legs and I have seen a huge difference. This soap is not no magical soap, it works just like any other product but to be able to achieve expected results, you have to be patient and have consistency in terms of its usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product, I had few issues regarding its delivery, my packaged had been damaged due to the poor service of USPS. When I mentioned that to the buyer, they took very great care of me and had sent me a pack of two kojie san soaps for free. The guy I spoke with was very kind and helpful, he even apologized to me on behalf of USPS. I would most definitely purchase from this buyer again.</li>
    <li> My arms are got dark because of sun but this soap really helps a lot ! Well you have to use it and use it  I have 3 weeks and my face are more brighter my arms aren&#x27;t too much but it is working well</li>
    <li> This product does not work and one of my friens either sorry I ordered seems like all the products I have ordered from Asia have not work something is not right here</li>
    <li> Saw results then skin went back to discoloration. Will stick with Dana stalker soap with glutathione. Bought this one because it was cheaper for 4.</li>
    <li> You have to use for at least 4 days in a row and lauther for about 3 minutes each time but this stuff really works</li>
    <li> The soap works it takes awhile but i love the feel of my skin. It does lighten the skin pigmentation.get a soap dish to contain for some reason it stains the tub. Love this buyer and reasonible prices and it is the real deal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old but I have a passion for skin care and&lt;br /&gt; beauty products and my Mom was on Amazon and she was looking for something to help my sun-damaged and acne spotted skin so we somehow clicked this soap and took a leap of faith we were not sure it was gonna work but I&#x27;ve been using this soap as my bath soap for almost a year now and my skin is even and bright and glowing and I Love this soap its all natural so the results last and dosn&#x27;t change it smells so nice and I get complements all the time Its my favorite bath soap and I would tell anyone to. Give it a try and see if it works for u.:-)</li>
    <li> This product works to even out dark spots! HIGLY RECOMMEND. Results after only a single week of use. I will be reordering soon.</li>
    <li> So far the best soap I ever used.It makes your red at first but then if you continue to used it makes skin soft...It clears acne and dark spots..try it you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m african american &amp; this soap does brighten the complexion. this is not going to be visible right away. i used it for about 6 months before i noticed a difference so, patience is key. i DID NOT buy this soap to lighten my skin color because i&#x27;m not insecure about having a darker complexion. i did buy this soap to brighten my complexion because it had become a bit dull. it cleans the skin very well. i only use it after i&#x27;ve taken my make up off for the day.</li>
    <li> I like the vendor deal. The soaps arrived in excellent condition. The firs time i used this soap i felled a tingling sensation on my face. It&#x27;s been four months of using the soap and i still feel it every now then. Make sure to get a good moisturizer because this soap is extremely drying.</li>
    <li> I love this, however I use it in moderation because of previous reviews of too much of a good thing.  Hopefully, the use of this once a day will last me at least a month and a help.  My skin glows and the flaws are disappearing.....But I use it on my body letting stay on for only for 5 minutes right now......But once my broken ankle heals I will let it stand for 10 minutes before rinsing.</li>
    <li> My skin is smooth and clearing up fast. Use it with my carotein and boy is my skin looking amazing after only a week and a half. I am so happy with my purchase. Supplier delivered the product fast. I am so happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Noticed my skin looking brighter and clearer from the second day! I lather it on my face and body and leave it on for 20 mins to an hour. It is also exfoiating my skin and leaving it smooth.</li>
    <li> I buy this soap all the time. It works great and its a great price. I highly recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> Now I have to say I read all the reviews and was very excited to try it. But I also know that there were some reviews that said no change. I&#x27;m showered with it once. Rubbed on and washed off about a minute later. I expected nothing. As I dried, I could tell there was a slight change on my body, but oh my gosh, my face and neck had been photoshopped to perfection. I wanted to cry. What a difference. I am hooked for as long as it works. Slightly dry with one use but I&#x27;ll take it for the changes! I truly expected nothing. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t experienced any problem with this soap. I was hesitant to buy at first because of some reviews i read saying you will get a breakout or it dries your skin. So far my skin is fine. After washing my face i make sure to use moisturizer. Its been a week since i started using this. I will update after two weeks of using it. Though i already see a big difference.</li>
    <li> THIS SOAP EXFOLIATES AND LIGHTENS. I LIVE BY THIS SOAP LOL. I LOVE IT. THE ONLY DOWNFALL IS THAT ITS A BIT ITCHING AT TIMES. AND IF YOU&#x27;RE NOT CAREFULL AND GET IT ON THE WRONG SPOTS IT BURNSSSSSSSSS LOL..</li>
    <li> I combined the 2 products lather when showering;  there is without doubt a noticable difference in the skins softness and clearing blackheads,discoloration. A youthful glow. I combine this soaping lather method with Kojie San Skin Lightening Red bar soap. I&#x27;m 2 weeks in using. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> The bomb! I love this soap!</li>
    <li> This soap is FANTASTIC! I am a 39 year old mixed race Black female.  I bought this soap to lighten old facial acne scars, dark knees and elbows, and armpits.  I did like some others suggested and melted each bar down in a 48 oz jug of water, then poured it into two 24-oz empty Suave body wash bottles for convenience.  One bar of soap can yield 48 oz of liquid Kojic Soap.  If you wash with it using the bar, it will melt very fast.  The entire bar was melted by the next morning after I placed it in the water.  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for almost 2 weeks now.  My skin looks radiant! The old acne scars on my face are already lightened by 50% after using this soap daily morning and evening every day.  I&#x27;ve also used it everywhere else on my body.  My armpits had darkened due to years of using aluminum based deodorants.  No more! After using this, in conjunction with an exfoliating skin pad and hydroquinone in my armpits, the dark brownish black color is finally completely gone.  I had tried hydroquinone alone and it didn&#x27;t work even after several weeks.  My caramel complexion doesn&#x27;t look much lighter, but the tiny marks that were sprinkled all over my body do look amazingly lighter and less defined.  I guess I can finally look forward to beautiful even toned skin after all these years.  I&#x27;m so excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better:  My daughter, who has very bad acne vulgaris began using this on her face.  Her skin literally looked like it had a mountain range growing on it.  After 6 days, I almost burst into tears.  Her face, which even dermatologist prescribed products couldn&#x27;t seem to clear up, looked 100% better.  She still had quite a few white heads and black heads left over after 6 days, but nowhere near what it had been a week before.  It&#x27;s almost 2 weeks now.  All major bumps on her skin have almost completely smoothed over.  Her cheeks and forehead look completely smooth now and her freckles are showing through on her skin.  She still has a few bumps on her chin, but I&#x27;m sure that in another week or so, those will be gone also.  Her chin has always been her major breakout region.  Her skin finally looks amazing.  I&#x27;m so happy that I ordered this product.  I&#x27;m about to order more.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. I saw a great difference on my skin (I used it for more than a month now) as it evens skin-tone. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make your skin white, but somehow it makes it glow from medium to fair. Although it may dry or make your skin flake a little, it&#x27;s expected. So, I would recommend body lotion every after use of this soap.</li>
    <li> It really works ..please try this soap !!!!!! I thought it was a joke the results will make u cry .. If u suffer from trouble skin to watch ur skin clear up is like no other feeling</li>
    <li> I love the soap in that it clears acne but like others said it is not a soap for lightening the skin.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product in the mail. When I received the soap I immediately used it and I could see a difference with the first use. After the second use I could really see a \\&quot;big\\&quot; difference !!!! I had to cut the bar into four pieces because the bars dissolve quickly and I keep the piece that I&#x27;m using in a ziplock bag or soap case. I will purchase the product again !!!!!</li>
    <li> If you suffer from keratosis pilaris or uneven skin tone or body and face breakouts or acne scars this is the product for you. I used to use glytone products and they are great but very expensive. This one on the other hand is cheap but really works. For those who are just starting to use this soap, dont take it to extremes like leaving it on for longer than 1 minute. Dont forget it contains acid. Otherwise it will burn your skin and you will have more problems at your hands. Use it once daily its more than enough. Use sunscreen or all your efforts will fly out the window. If you prone to breakouts use essential oil after shower never put lotions and creams cause most of them have mineral oil which makes you breakout. Dont use it on face everyday unless you breakout a lot. 2-3 times a week really helps to exfoliate. Thats about it. I</li>
    <li> This  product is just okay ,  I  didnt  see  any improvement  with  my  skin  tone . I  will  not be ordering anymore .</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s good worth it I feel skin change so I feel bater.u must try it . But for my skin it&#x27;s bater</li>
    <li> Love love love this soap so much i use it to clear up blemishes on my skin. It keeps your face lookin nice and clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always amazed how kojic acid can deep clean the skin and this product is no exception. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap I&#x27;ve used so far... lightened my skin within a week of using it that I had to stop for a bit. Now only use it on targeted areas.</li>
    <li> kojie san is the best for people who have Hidradenitis.  ever since i&#x27;ve used it, i have not had one break out.  and what i like most of all, it fades all dark spots left from the hidradentis.</li>
    <li> Felt squeaky clean but no lightning of scars</li>
    <li> This soap is absolutely amazing, it works absolute WONDERS! It has gotten rid of my tans, dark spots, and evened out my skin tone overall. My skin has lightened substantially, about 2-3 shades already and I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks now. I use it twice daily for my face and whenever I shower. The soap is very VERY drying to the skin, so make sure you moisturize after use. The soap bar itself is quite large, so it&#x27;ll last quite sometime! This 4-pack deal is amazing, especially for the results you get after use! Totes recommend this soap!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year. I used to you the same soap from Funky mommy.com.  This is much cheaper.  I use a bar per week and occasionally take 2 weeks off.  The smell is great and its strong enough to lightnen dark areas, but gentle enough to use daily. I think of it as a brightener as opposed to a whiterner.  I use with exfoliating gloves.  This soap has helped to brighten dark knees, elbows, underarms and inner thighs.  My stretch marks are virtually gone now as well. I have purchased from several sellers, they are all good.  This seller was particularly fast with shipping.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice skin lighting.</li>
    <li> This is terrible. Causes breakouts! Do not use ! It makes u look all pale and the results U will get is discoloration !</li>
    <li> This product works just as well at the Glutathione soap- maybe even faster. Personally, I go for subtleties, therefore the glutathione would be my 1st choice :)</li>
    <li> the soap burned my face. I do not fault the soap, I have many allergies and it left my face with hot spots. I encourage others to try it. Japanese women have beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> This soap is working quicker than any cream I have used in years. My skin is multiple shades of brown and I have a small burn under my eye that healed darker than my face...this soap has lightened it up and even me out in 5 days! I&#x27;m excited to have found something that work&#x27;s! I will be using this soap on my whole body from now on.</li>
    <li> Great product, but I would recommend if you buy this use it on your body first because I&#x27;ve noticed when I do it all together my face gets lighter faster but I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery! Product as described. The soap is authentic Kojie San soap. The best soap for exfoliation that I have ever tried. Amazing results.</li>
    <li> All I can say is I wish I knew about this soap when I was a teenager cause to really really really helps with my Asian acne sokn I have discorations/hyper pigmentation/dark spots whatever you want to call them and it totally is clearing up after just 2 weeks and bieve me I tried everything accutane 2x and all the seem products out there this also reallyightwns my skin I&#x27;m very pale now which I&#x27;m I&#x27;m not sure I like or dislike. It might get scary is I get even lighter but I&#x27;m willing to just see how light my skin can get... Cause I&#x27;ve already experienced how dark I can get... Anyways I highly recommend this product it&#x27;s inexpensive and it really works but u will be dry so just put some lotion after</li>
    <li> Perhaps this product should be marketed as a skin complexion &amp;#34;evening&amp;#34; soap.  In my case, I can&#x27;t say it lightens me; rather it has minimized the naturally occurring tan lines I have developed over my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the product 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I lather up excessively, but one bar only lasts me 1 week of showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a word of caution for any males that may use/try this product: I made the mistake of using this soap on my male member.  The stinging that resulted when I rinsed off was a tad bit painful.  Needless to say, there are certain areas of the body that are more sensitive than others.  Keep this in mind and wash accordingly.</li>
    <li> This soap is a shower staple of mine due to the fact that it smells fantastic AND evens out my skin. I&#x27;m already quite pale but it helps to lighten up the darker patches of my skin that stand out a bit more. My only suggestion would be to not use it on your face and use it sparingly as it can be quite drying. You&#x27;ll need to moisture up after!</li>
    <li> I really like this soap because it smells good...&lt;br /&gt;but the effects are kind of..eh. I&#x27;m a male, age 17 and have been u ssing this soap for about 2-3 weeks. i did notice a slight change in skin color, but it was only if i used it that day. So I guess it&#x27;s a temporary lightener... i dont really use</li>
    <li> The soap had a pleasant smell and lathered really well, but it never lighten the dark spots on my skin.  It is better just to by Ambi or a prescription strength hydroquinone to lighten and blemish or dark marks on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have melasma from sun damage and I used it religiously day and night for about a month straight and didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Still same dark spots:(&lt;br /&gt;Smells great though!</li>
    <li> My Filipina wife uses this soap and has this to say about it: &amp;#34;Not sure about the whitening abilities of this soap but I like it. I feel like it cleans my skin very well.  Some reviewers mentioned that it makes their skin dry. I don&#x27;t have that problem because I use Nivea liquid soap after washing with this soap. I break-out specially during summer months maybe because I have oily skin. I think Kojie San soap helps me have clearer skin.  I recommend you try a small pack first before buying this.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product, gets rid of blemishes rapidly.</li>
    <li> I initially bought the 2 pack of this soap but it goes so quickly I ordered the 4 pack. Im African American  and suffer from severe hyper-pigmentation in my underarms, elbows and facial area from a long battle with acne. This soap works! It really works! In the month and a half I have started to use it I&#x27;ve seen a difference. I know its going to take a long time for my skin tone to even out b/c I am darker but I am fully satisfied with the results so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Papaya soap offered on Amazon but I never saw a change. I honestly attribute that to the fact that I am brown skin and the product wasn&#x27;t strong enough to lighten my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Im sure you&#x27;ve read by now that it WILL dry your skin out. I have very oily skin on my face and it even managed to dry it out after vigorous use. I use coconut oil/shea butter mix at night and slather it on to combat the dryness and it works wonders.</li>
    <li> this product helped clear my daughters acne and know is the only acne clearing product she use. defenitly worth investing in. helps acne, and clear up sun tan.</li>
    <li> This would be my 3rd time purchasing this soap same distributor but I received a different product on the 3rd go around...before the product I received had this amazing smelling &amp; it worked! This time around this soap smells like I don&#x27;t even know :-( it&#x27;s not as orange &amp; it does not work...</li>
    <li> Took about the second to third soap to see results. The kojic acid gluth soap worked so much faster i saw results on the second use.</li>
    <li> Great just what I need remove all the dark spot</li>
    <li> I get a really clean feel when I bathe with these.  Tends to be drying though so moisturize immediately after showering</li>
    <li> My skin feels cleaner and looks brighter after using this product.  I clean my face several times a day with this soap.  I cannot live without it.  It is a vital party of my facial cleaning routine.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for a while now and I can surely attest to it&#x27;s effectiveness. Since I prefer liquid soaps, I cut the soap into little chunks and dropped them into water for a couple of days. The soap melted very quickly therefore allowing me to use it as a liquid bath soap. My skin has started to even out nicely. I went a step further and added some coconut oil to my personal mixture. I feel very hydrated after every shower. Matter of fact, my daughter just told me today that I looked more even toned......(chuckle) Will surely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This soap has many different side affects, because I knew it dries out your skin I decided to use this soap once every other day. That still wasn&#x27;t enough of a break for it not to have affects on my skin. It gives me these bumps on my forehead after using it consistently. I think it has something to do with acid. So I have decided to use this for my face once aweek and I also use it for my body it smells really good. Body use doesn&#x27;t has a impact like the facial use. Been using for almost 3weeks and have noticed a slight difference on my forehead. Besides the bumps this so soap works well. I recommend using once or twice a week to maintain healthy moist skin.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to believe all of the &amp;#34;raving&amp;#34; reviews, but they are completly accurate.  I cannot believe the difference it has made on the brown sun spots (on my chest).  It has eliminated the spots, and now all I need to do is use SPF50 and continue to use this amazing product!</li>
    <li> This order didn&#x27;t work as great as the little ones I bought from another vendor. Still drying but not lightening quick enough.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap...I want to buy it in bulk because it is just that good. Clears the skin and give my face and body a gorgeous golden brown glow. The dark areas on my knees and elbows are lightening so quickly, which never happened before, not even with heavy use of hydroquinione. I would recommend this soap to anyone with dark skin or who suffers from hyperpigmentatioin. It isn&#x27;t a whitening soap...I love being black, so I am not trying to &amp;#34;lighten&amp;#34; my complexion. I just want it to be even toned and healthy. This soap does just that! Great product.</li>
    <li> I started seeing results after 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reasons I don&#x27;t know, I started to have pimples on my back 5 months ago. At first I thought nothing about it. But then it started to get bad and left ugly dark spots on my back. I tried this soap and thought nothing about it. 2 months after using this soap, I noticed that the dark spots on my back started to lighten up. The change wasn&#x27;t so drastic that I barely noticed it. One thing I didn&#x27;t like about this soap is that it gave me rashes on my face, but I won&#x27;t give it a 4 star just because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest to those people who say that this doesn&#x27;t work to not say that this does not work if you only have used this for a month. Things like this soap won&#x27;t do any drastic work on your skin no matter how long you leave this on on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you leave it on for an hour or a day. You won&#x27;t see change for at least 2 months. You need to be PATIENT.</li>
    <li> So I got this soap for mainly 1 reason - to hopefully even out my blotchy skin.  I&#x27;m a 29 year old African American women with skin that is SO uneven, especially my face and neck, so I&#x27;m, hoping that this soap will do the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging - I received the soap three days ago [it arrived FAST] I purchased it from -Key2vitality-, and it was in one of those cardboard envelopes.  I ordered the 4 pack, and their were two bars of soap in each package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent - I&#x27;ve seen reviewers say that this soap has a nice smell, but I haven&#x27;t noticed cause I have a bad cold right now [lol].  So when it&#x27;s gone, I&#x27;ll take a sniff and let everyone know what it smells like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap Itself - It&#x27;s a tangerine orange colored soap in a square shape.  The soap melts [don&#x27;t know another way to describe it] pretty good with a little bit of water, just make sure NOT to leave your soap lying in a soap dish with water, you&#x27;ll have soap soup by the next day [lol].  Drain any excess water and allow the bar to dry. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day so far and to be honest, I haven&#x27;t noticed any &#x27;burning&#x27; sensations like others have described, but who knows?  Only time will tell.  The soap IS VERY DRYING, that I will agree with!  My skin is already typed as dry skin, so this soap makes it like desert dry, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine - I use it morning and night.  I wet the soap, use an exfoliating glove, lather it and exfoliate my face and neck.  I leave it on for awhile [while I brush my teeth] and then I rinse it out later.  I use a HEAVY face cream [I use St. Ives Timeless Skin with Collagen] in the morning and at night, I use MSM lotion [which is a thinner lotion, so I put on a second coating once the first one sets in].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve Noticed So Far - It&#x27;s way too early to see a visible change, but I do feel a change when I touch my skin, it feels SO SMOOTH!  The skin on my neck and face is so soft and smooth, which is great because it&#x27;s been feeling rough all winter [lol].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s it for now, I&#x27;ll update probably every two weeks [that seems like a good amount of time] and let everyone know how its working for me.  So until then, see ya! :)&lt;br /&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -6/19/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to update this [lol].  Anyway, I have noticed a change in my skin, specifically my neck [it got a little lighter and definitely clearer - I used to have old acne scars that are fading away.]  I use it on my face, but the only reason why I haven&#x27;t noticed a change is because I got a tan so I can&#x27;t verify any skin tone changes for that, at least not yet.  But my skin is clearing up a bit so we shall see... Next update in July....</li>
    <li> I received these packaged nicely and shipped in a timely manner. I have used it only twice and can see that it is starting to actually work. Great product and I will buy more.</li>
    <li> my skin is looking better and brighter every day! My daughter has started using it as well and she loves it. I have to order more because the soap does desolve fast. I wish I could find it in stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product late-January of this year and have been using it regularly since then. As far as I can tell, there has not been much lightening of my skin tone. Despite all the following all directions, such as using sunscreen religiously and using only after sunset, no clear results have shown. This may be because I have medium-exposure to sunlight while commuting to and from school. I can say, however, that I have not yet gotten darker as I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, I have broken out in acne since using this product. In terms of effectiveness against pimples, kojic acid is a double-edged sword. The kojic acid will dry out pimples and make them disappear quicker, but the dry skin will lead to infections that leads to more pimples. For those suffering from acne, moisturizing is a must.</li>
    <li> terrible, didnt work, complete waste of money. been using it for the first 2 months, saw no results whatsoever. i stopped using it. crap soap, lol. i really dont recommend this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the hype people talking about. It is okay but I find that shea butter soaps works better for my skin</li>
    <li> Everything is better in fours. Plus it works really well so always like to have a spare on hand.</li>
    <li> it really does brighten up your skin, as for color changing if you use it everyday it will but i just wanted to erase my black markes. this really even your skin out as well</li>
    <li> Great product and amazing Customer service. This soap is the bomb.com, it really works. With this seller you&#x27;ll receive the real deal plus top quality!! I used this soap for a couple of days and it will definetley lightened your skin and it will also help for discoloration and dark spots! I love this soap. I&#x27;ve tried Likas and this by far is my Favorite, this is the safest way to brightened! I recommend to the whole world, get it and you will not regret!!</li>
    <li> I chose this rating simply because I love it. People have complained about skin drying but my skin hasn&#x27;t had any issues with that, and my skin is actually getting lighter now, used it for over 2 months now and I recently bought 2 4 packs of soap. It gets rid of acne and blemishes evens the skin tone out as well as your skin stays soft and supple like a baby&#x27;s skin. I am complimented by my skintone by lots of people. I recently sent out my soap to my mom and aunt in Cambodia and they are impressed that it gets rid of their scars and rids of them their acne as well. I wash my face once a day with this soap and it just works wonders on me. I actually have a light tan because I am Cambodian, but people actually now can see that I am part Japanese know because of my skintone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disliked one thing about this soap is that it stings your skin, but after awhile you get used to it and it no longer stings. When I used to use Likas I had no sting or anything at all, but it didn&#x27;t work on my skin. What I can say is that if it stings you know that it is doing its magic !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone who is trying to whiten their skin. I used to use papaya soap, but it wasn&#x27;t strong enough and didn&#x27;t give me good enough results. I can recommend this product to people who want to get rid of scars blemishes and acne. Also those who wanna lighten their skin, this is the best product to use.</li>
    <li> It is okay. It takes while to deliver.</li>
    <li> Very good soap....I&#x27;m African American and it has me glowing.... but the only down side is u have to make sure your  skin is very hydrated because it will cause dry spots on your skin</li>
    <li> Helps with my dark spots. Its been a week and I barely see them</li>
    <li> I purchase this soap 3 weeks ago and my results are the BOMB!!!!  I get so many compliments on my skin now.  I had a bad sun burn from traveling and could not find a product that would take my skin back to that beautiful complexion I once had.  I went to U2 and found this product.  I&#x27;m glad I did and I&#x27;m telling everyone that I know about this soap. My body and face are the same shade now.  Am a African American women and loving my new even golden brown beautiful skin[[ASIN:B007CMS5C4 Kojie San Skin Lightening Soap 135g 4-Pack]].</li>
    <li> I do notice that my skin is brighter, but I have to take a star because it dries my skin. A good moisturizer after shower then it works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of skin whitening soap and this one is my favorite so far. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 2 years and I hate being without it. It makes your skin look so bright. I originally got it to help whiten my scars and it works a little for that but I started using other products as well that I think are helping a little more for that but I&#x27;m already hooked on the soap so I don&#x27;t plan to stop using this</li>
    <li> Love it very much!!! Will purchase again soonest!</li>
    <li> This soap has changed my face drastically in the time i have had it, 5 days to be exact. I suffered from hyper-pigmentation during my pregnancy and after , i literally had a mask on my face, a dark mask and this soap has taken it away, i&#x27;m just so happy and glad that i bought it in bulk and also extremely happy that i made this purchase. I was a little skeptical about soaps like this after my encounter with LIKAS soap that made my situation worse but i&#x27;m glad i took that leap of faith and got this one cause it&#x27;s done wonders for me. LOVE IT !! i recommended to everyone i know and my mom is even using it now. Super fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a big difference, but it smells great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 wks now and I can start to see a difference in my complexion. I gave my daughter and my sister a bar and they too love how their skin is staring to look. At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t doing anything but when I took recent pictures my skin looked so golden brown......I mean (Beautiful)!!!! I would recommend this soap, being that I love my results thus far!!</li>
    <li> i was so excited to get this soap and then when i got it i immediately started using it but i have been using it for a month now going into my 2nd month and i don&#x27;t see a difference at all. the only thing it did for my skin was made it extremely dry i think i&#x27;m going to look into another product.</li>
    <li> There is much to be said about this product. However, I will keep it short. The soap work for the first 10 days, after that it no longer produced. Maybe is t was do to dirt or the soap have limited effect to do the job seeking. I am AA, with glow of the inner face. Using the produce for the mention days, I could fell it working, my face would sting when I put the soap on it. after 10 days I could not feel the stinging. I mostly use it at night, and if I used it in the day, I used sun block.  I did not get the even skin tone I was looking for, nevertheless, I did notice spotty fading of the face. This could have been the water down version soap. I will us it until gone. I do think if right brand purchase, the result seeking could be attain.</li>
    <li> This soap is AMAZING! Makes your skin soooooo smooth!!! Just try it! You see a difference right after and then in a couple days you just transform. Warning! This is an exfoliating soap and does not need to be coupled with regular exfoliating. I made the mistake of scrubbing my face with an abrasive cloth while using the soap and got some scaring. So yea, just a regular soft face cloth is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the lightening goes, I think it just prevents you from getting darker. It didn&#x27;t lighten me much, just if I got a slight tan that day in the sun it would remove that, but it wont go much further past my natural skin color.</li>
    <li> this soap does work I use it in the shower and try to put it on as soon as you get in to let it set a little good soap</li>
    <li> I use it to wash my face and body every two days because its too drying to use daily but WOW DOES IT DELIVER WHAT IT PROMISES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is radiant, smooth, gets more even each time i use lt . THE CLAIM ABOUT LIGHTENING ISN&#x27;T REALLY TRUE BUT THAT IT SHEDS OFF OLD DRY SKIN LAYERS REVEALING A MORE EVEN TONED NEW SKIN ...&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS IF U WANT TO EXFOLIATE AND EVEN OUT ROUGH SKIN ... But make sure to rehydrate the new skin as this soap does dry you out :)</li>
    <li> Bright orange soap, makes a a good lather. Seems like I can see the dirt coming off. I can&#x27;t see any lightning although I have not been using everyday.</li>
    <li> This soap help my acne Sooooooooo much!like wow really amazing. Lighten my skin a Lil I want something stronger though</li>
    <li> I am really glad that I hasn&#x27;t dried my skin, as much as other reviews state. Great buy. My skin is clearer ..Love it</li>
    <li> I like it I love how it lathers. I bought a lotion for my knees and elbows but I will start using the soap and letting sit over night like a user suggested lets see what happens</li>
    <li> This product works so amazingly I found myself compelled to write a review about it, which I NEVER do. Not only does it work to lighten my skin I have absolutley no acne (which I&#x27;ve never had a problem with in the first place but with this soap not even an occasional bump). Although the price has gone up a little I can&#x27;t complain since the four-pack lasts about a month. In all seriousness I had to take a break from it because people actually started to tell me I looked pale. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I dont care for the scent and doesn&#x27;t seem to light my under arm or scars on my body</li>
    <li> Works well but bars are small.  Put bars in zippy bag and away from moisture after each use to preserve product.  Good for those with light to mild hyper-pigmentation.</li>
    <li> I seldom write reviews, actually never, BUT this soap is just awesome.  I can honestly say I have tried it all, from lasers such as  fraxel and IPL, to obagi, to expensive skin bleaching creams, you name it.  I have yet to have a product work like this soap.  It&#x27;s only been two weeks, and I don&#x27;t have to wear foundation or powder anymore.  My skin is back to it&#x27;s old young self, love it.  I HAD terrible acne scars and melasma, and it&#x27;s seriously, almost all gone.  I will continue to order, as share with my family, as I already have...try it, for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this soap a try. It contains Kojic which is a skin lightening product. I had a very bad leg infection which took alone to heal. After it did heal it left brown spots all over my legs.  I had to do something so I used different creams to lighten the spots. I saw this soap and I decided to try  it  because it is an all over skin lightener.  It does not dry your skin and the worse spots are now a pink color the others are gone. I really like this soap, the price is affordable and you can get 2 different sizes.  It come in a pkg. of three or you can get the larger size. It has a light fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm any other fragrance you may use. I would definitely recommend this soap to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Have used this twice before this is now my third purchase. Skin does look lighter</li>
    <li> The  Soap is excellent !!!</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing helps remove dark spots over a period of time! Package came on time and in tact I will def be ordering more soon :-)</li>
    <li> Not a bad one, Been using  since 2 weeks, Made my skin very dry , haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet.</li>
    <li> i am also one of the people who purchased this soap because of the great reviews i saw concerning this product,i have been using this product for abt 2 weeks now and i love wht am seeing so far,i use it twice a day and i leave on for abt 10-20 mins before i wash it of,i use it on my face but not around my mouth bcos the skin around my mouth s very sensitive and it burns when i leave it around my mouth for too long.this soap s very effective when it comes to evening out the skin tone especially on african or african american skin,but it does not do that much when it comes to skinlightening,it may lighten ur skin a shade or two but that abt it,you may wanna use a skin lightening cream or lotion with  it to get a better result,if skin lightening is ur reason for buying this soap.i will still use it and buy it again bcos it cheaper than going to the dermatologist.my skin s glowing,smooth n some black marks on my legs r begining to fade away,i use it with clear essence body milk and vitamin e oil,i will update my review in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this soap, would definitely reorder it. I am still on the first one, too soon to see results.</li>
    <li> This soap really does work. You will notice a slight difference within days and even more difference in a month. Keyword is patients. Be patient and you&#x27;ll be happy you bought this kojic acid soap.</li>
    <li> I love this soap so far, but the on the second time i order them i only received on my mail is the packaging without any soap, so i sent them an email asking &amp;#34;where is the soap??&amp;#34; and told them what happened, though knowing in that case it is beyond on their control and they sent me another set of this soap on a priority mail which i appreciated, but guess what??! I received 3pack-100g instead of 4pack-135g, totally very disappointed with their service, paid it with the right amount of money yet unreasonable amount of product! it&#x27;s just so unfair!</li>
    <li> Creamy lather it does work to really clean your skin.</li>
    <li> I love it!! it really whitened my skin. It dried up my skin in the beginning but its getting better as I continue using it.</li>
    <li> arrived on time and we love it.. smell nice but shouldnt use morning and night.. itll dry your skin out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kojie-san regular soap since 2 years ago. My skin was like MAC NC 42 (search Google Images for pictures), damaged because of the sun. and now I am NC15. It  helped a lot with scar marks and freckles. The soap really works, but of course, you can not go out under the sun and always use sunscreen even inside of home. If you go under the sun while using this soap, your skin will BURN, so be aware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I also ordered the Dream White version. I was looking the ingredients, and there are only two differences: the Dream White has an adorable vanilla scent and also includes collagen. In my skin, it feels stronger than the regular soap, so do not leave it on your face if you are not used to it. Oh, and this one is ORANGE, while the Dream White version is WHITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Kojie-san Lightening lotion and I think it helps, but the main effect is from the soap, I am sure. From now, I think I will always order the Dream White instead of the regular version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller is selling the original version of the soap. BE AWARE WITH EBAY SELLERS!!! Last time I got a fake soap, so always order from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Much more effective than Papaya soap. My underarms have become much lighter and my overall skin appearance has become brighter. I also have zero acne now that I use this soap. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am extremely impressed with this product. I wasn&#x27;t expecting to notice a difference for at least a week as suggested by other comments, but I saw a difference from day one.  I feel great about my skin.</li>
    <li> I give it a five star for service and the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and split the pack between my cousin and myself. I saw the exfoliating effects with the first wash and of course had to immediately moisturize my skin afterwards. Despite it being winter, my skin isn&#x27;t all that dry--so long as I moisturize after showering and before going outside. The first thing I noticed was that the dark spots on my knees and elbows faded the fastest. My skin tone lightened by a shade and a half within a week. I quite like this soap, it leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean and has a nice fruit-like scent ( doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemical at all. )</li>
    <li> loving this product.  my sister told me about it just got to see if it really works.  Had some dark area on my faces, but now it is disappearing...love the product a lot.</li>
    <li> I loooove this product it works works works. I am a now a regular customer and will be for life. I loooooove this soap. I was a whole shade lighter in two days. I loooove this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a brown skin african American with hyper pigmentation in my forehead and I have some acne on my face . I read a lot of nice review about that soap first I was so happy to try .first The soap is very dry and have a burn reaction that all it does . I don&#x27;t see any lighting skin reaction either it&#x27;s been 3week of using it that a waste of money based on truly own experience</li>
    <li> THE SOAP MAKES YOUR SKIN SOFT AND SILKY IF USED THE RIGHT WAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 WHEN USEING THE SOAP ON BODY AFTER USE PUT SOME BODY LOTION ON AND YOU SKIN WONT DRY UP.&lt;br /&gt;2 WHEN WASHING YOUR FACE WITH IT I WOULD NOT USE LOTION ON FACE IF HAVE ACNE THIS SOAP IS GOOD TO DRI UP THE ACNE ON FACE AND GIVES YOU A REALLY NICE GLOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI THIS SOAP WORKS YOU NEED TO USE IT EVERY DAY AND I USE THIS SOAP AS A MY ONLY SOAP AND LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> It cleared up my skin but I been using it for like 3 months,  no lightening....  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for lightening effect but it clears acne and such</li>
    <li> you get darker after a while. Hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> excelent, good product</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant in buying something for my skin online...but this was awesome! I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 1/2 weeks and almost all dark spots/tan are gone. I have mild eczema which makes my skin really sensitive but this has not caused any problems. When I use it, I leave it on for 3-5 minutes until the foam fades then I rinse it off. This stuff is amazing! My color is a bit lighter, It smells great, My face is so smooth, and it doesn&#x27;t give me rashes which is the best part lol PS: I recommend also cutting the soap bar into squares or slice it down to what you will use for the day, it melts quickly with water! Also use some good lotion after. One more thing! If you have REALLY sensitive skin don&#x27;t leave it on more then 1-2mins. Eczema has made my arms and leg skin rough so I can leave it longer and it won&#x27;t sting, but on face and neck if you already use any other skin products that peel or exfoliate it may sting! Specially if you have a cut. DON&#x27;T get it in your eyes! Also if you want to be MJ white this is not for you, this does lighten skin but not a lot maybe a few 2-4 shades lighter depending on your skin color.</li>
    <li> It WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from hyper pigmentation all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;This soap helped lighten my skin color by at least a shade.&lt;br /&gt;I am buying some more now.</li>
    <li> I was at first doubting to buy this product coz the other soaps that i have been using didn&#x27;t make any difference at all,but this product didn&#x27;t fail me...i use this as my body soap and i can see a big difference on my skin,also it helped my skin look nice,I would definitely buy this product again...</li>
    <li> This soap did nothing but dry my skin severely.  I bought it to fade some scaring I had always been self conscience about.  No results what so ever.</li>
    <li> I think it even out my skin. Don&#x27;t know for sure because I use _ so many products.&lt;br /&gt;I have no complains. Some dark spots get lighter</li>
    <li> The main reason why i bought the soap was the smell--very citrusy. One thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars is that the soap easily melts. In terms of shipping and product, I recommend this seller. :)</li>
    <li> I just started using this soap. Like many of the others have stated that this soap is very drying. You will have to use a good lotion (Aveeno) or moisturizer to balance the dying effect that this soap has. However, with anything that you try it takes time and patients (4 to 6 wks.) to see any results if any at all. I personally would recommend that you use an exfoliating glove (Smit Co Exfoliating Gloves/ Leaves skin soft &amp; silky) when using this product on the face and body because you may have better results. I would also recommend that you buy the four pack to make sure that you do not run out.</li>
    <li> I love it. I use exfoliating gloves with it. So the result is clear even skin. I had a sunburn from years ago that was never able to get rid of after exfoliating in using this soap I was able to finally see my huge dark spot fade. my skin is 1 color now and I&#x27;m very happy this is the best soap and product that I&#x27;ve ever used towards taking away dark marks and discolorations it evens and brighten my overall complexion my racial ethnicity is African American and Hispanic</li>
    <li> this soap is unique to say the least. i love the smell to it, it has a orange citrus type scent to it but my thing is is that i havent received any drastic results yet but im not expecting a prayer but overall this is a soap worth buying</li>
    <li> Does not really whiten skin, more of an exfoliant.</li>
    <li> Only been using it for a week now I noticed some tingling it is a very deep cleaning soap meaning it for sure remove dirt and etc and it smells really great.But I notice that I am not seeing any lightning etc I use once a day at night  not twice daily but my skin looks like it is getting darker. Will write another review once I am done with the other three bars I purchased four total.&lt;br /&gt;Erika</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working, the only down side is the leaves the skin extremely dry and itchy..yet works on clearing all the dullness..I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
    <li> i have used this product several times and it removs dark spots from the skin and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> First, the company is great with handling any issues that arise and they are quick about it. Second, I love this soap. I use it once a day at night. Lather up with gloves to aid in exfoliation and circulation. Leave on for 1-5min then rinse. Follow-up with a very nourishing and moisturizing lotion. If you don&#x27;t do this your skin will dry out. And in the morning I use a more gentle maintenance body-wash that has brightening properties to is as well. I also follow it up with nourishing and moisturizing lotion and sunblock. An SPF30 or higher is necessary. If you don&#x27;t do this you will undo any progress you make. Some people use it day and night but I can tell you, your soap wont last. I&#x27;ve been using mine since April 6th and my bar has shrunk a lot. But my skin is clearing up and has a glow to it now. I am a medium-deep complected AA.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to recieve this soap because I wanted to lighten my skin prior to taking a Caribbean vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for a month, twice a day, I used this soap.  I scrubbed my body with exfoliating gloves, I left it on for 15 min, I even sometimes let it dry and slept in it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only results I had was extremely itchy dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap did not lighten my skin at all.  Btw, my skin is African American, and med-dark brown about the shade of Kelly Rowland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointing.</li>
    <li> Eh.... I was super excited to try this... It&#x27;s literally ,only down the drain. But I will continue to use my bars of lightening soap in hopes it works ;)</li>
    <li> Being a Japanese product I was expecting much more lightning.  It did not lightened too much.  Will try another product.</li>
    <li> pricey , but it works shipping was fast , it really doing a good job , i rub it on my wet skin , then used wash cloth to clean my skin ,  very good soap i order 6 will be ordering more to stock up .</li>
    <li> So, I bought this to even out my uneven Brown skin tone, not to Whiten or become lighter. So, I expected more of a uniform complexion. Not expecting miracles. I am on my 3rd bar of the 4 pack and so far, I haven&#x27;t notice any difference in complexion at all. Not evening, brightening or smoothing the texture.  I don&#x27;t know if majority of people using these products have light skin or are using bleaching cream too but this did nada for me. I read one review who said s/he leave it on for a few minutes but who has time for that? I used these with exfoliating gloves too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Bars are small in size but other than that its ok. i feel like the soap is authentic because Ive bought from other vendors and there kojic acid soaps did nothing. But with this one ive gotten a reaction out of it . Thumbs up . Ill write another review when i finish all of the bars</li>
    <li> This soap works amazingly. I have dark skin and when I scar, it&#x27;s really bad. I started using this soap in addition to the skin bleaches I was prescribed by my dermatologist and it improved my skin a LOT. My skin was brighter and the scars started to fade after about a month of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, it burned my skin a bit, but I built up a tolerance to it. I loved it so much, that I just ordered a 4-pack of the stuff. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I used it faithfully for more than 6 months, hoping it will lighten my skin. But it DOES NOT WORK!!!</li>
    <li> This product is not the miracle worker I was expecting. It has really evened the tone on my face but as far as dark marks, thay are still pretty dark. I haven&#x27;t really seen any change to any other parts of my body, especially my legs where the skin tone is very uneven from years of dealing with eczema. The soap smells great, lathers really well  and last a really long time, if you put it in a soap box, otherwise it will melt really easily. I would reccomend this to someone to even the tone on their  face but not to fade hyperpigmentation from acne or etc.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates very well, omg I am reordering this soap and will continue to reorder when I get low. This is my favorite soap for life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soap for almost a month now and the acne scars on my face are disappearing already! A great product..fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I purchase 8 bars full of excitement that it would work well I&#x27;m almost done with my three bar an I don&#x27;t see any difference in my color in the beginning I did get a few rashes from soap an some tingling on the skin. I will continue using until all my bars are completely gone then I&#x27;ll try another product</li>
    <li> I think I am too tanned for this product. However, this soap feels great and works really well for cleaning oneself. You can actually feel the kojic acid when you wash your face. It burns!-a little.</li>
    <li> This soap will lightening you, go gentle on your face loving it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a black  light  skin english girl.  Now i am fair skin.  clean wjiter skin.  Loving it!!!</li>
    <li> Not too crazy about this so it didn&#x27;t work as good as a described</li>
    <li> Works great on African American skin, I love it</li>
    <li> I received my koji San soap as expected on delivery date, it came properly packaged with bubble wrap an no damage to the package what so ever, I have been using this product for a while an though I should make a review on how great this product works! I have had a bad perms tan for at least 6 years or more and never thought I would get rid of it , once I heard about this soap I had to try it out and it is whiteout a doubt one of the best decisions ever not only have I almost gotten rid of my Permatan it also helps with acne which is a plus! I was about 4 shades away from my natural color and now only about 1! This product is amazing, the product is a bit drying to the skin after usage so I do advise that you buy a good moisturizer and apply especially during winter season when your skin because even more dryer than normal. Awesome product nonetheless</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for a few months and it has lightening and brightening my skin up a lot. It got rid of my farmer&#x27;s tan arms! Yay! I noticed it has faded my old acne scars and freckles too.The only downside is that one bar usually last me about two weeks but that&#x27;s because I use it everyday. Don&#x27;t expect results overnight and leaving it on for more than five minutes will not help but harm you.&lt;br /&gt;I always buy it from Key2vitality because their prices is the most reasonable and I get it fast.</li>
    <li> I left this soap on a MINIMUM of 15 minutes EVERY night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be good for clearing up acne, but you need to leave it on a minimum of 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The bar will last longer if you leave it in a sealed plastic container.&lt;br /&gt;It is not ordinary soap, so don&#x27;t use it just for washing.&lt;br /&gt;Put it on your face and neck, be careful of your eyes and then go and read or watch TV for 15 minutes and then use a moisurizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not lighten my skin in any way, shape or form.&lt;br /&gt;It dries your skin out (exfoliates) and that&#x27;s it.</li>
</ol>
