<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Well made product and timely shipping.</li>
    <li> Quick service, great product,thanks!</li>
    <li> Received my order in a timely fashion and love the way the nail gently smooths my nails!</li>
    <li> Great product, well made and perfect size and great hard cover storage that protects the file in your purse.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this file but it&#x27;s quite thick and will never fit under my nails. Like the case alot.</li>
    <li> This little nail file is wonderful!  It&#x27;s very effective while being gentle to your nails.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Works as described.</li>
    <li> This nail file is exactly as shown and described and arrived on time. I&#x27;ve just learned that glass nail files work wonders in getting nails smooth. Can&#x27;t wait to use mine</li>
    <li> Great merchandise...really love it.  Fast shipping...will use again.</li>
    <li> So far, I love it.  Will be ordering one for my sister at Christmas!!!</li>
    <li> So beautiful and classy!  I had a glass nail file a few years ago and lost it, so I&#x27;m so happy to be able to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;The crystal nail file gives your nails that smooth finish without any ragged edges.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I Love It!  Very Classy and works great!  I love that it comes with a case to keep it clean and safe from breaking.  Super fast shipping and packaged very well.</li>
    <li> A glass file was a new idea to me but I&#x27;m NEVER going back to emery boards.  This file is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great product ..... I love it! Arrived in perfect condition and sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> The nail file is really nice and the case protects it from breaking.  I have given several of these as gifts to grateful recipients. Always a hit. I highly recommend this quality product.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast service</li>
    <li> best nail file ever!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for another crystal nail file and this one is just as I had hoped - great quality!  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have had other crystal files..this one by far is the best! Its thick ,feels nice in your hand and works great and would make a nice gift too!</li>
    <li> Very nice. Gave as teachers gifts.</li>
    <li> what more can I ask for</li>
    <li> Excellent product nicely presented and fit nicely into a handbag great for out and about.</li>
    <li> Very nice nail file--regular use helps to keep my nails from splitting. The case is great to protect the file while in my purse.</li>
    <li> This is  the very best crystal glass nail fine.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I had a glass nail file before (unfortunately, broke it!) and it was thinner than this. This one is too thick and I can&#x27;t do the edges of my nails  because I can&#x27;t fit the file between my finger and the nail on the sides. Sorry. I really wanted to like it and be able to use it, but I couldn&#x27;t work with it.</li>
    <li> Great product! I need one to keep in my purse too!</li>
    <li> Love these glass nail files!  They make great gifts!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Received product earlier than anticipated! Love it that the glass emery file has a &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34;! Works well and will order more for daughters and daughter-in-law for next years Christmas!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great nail files.  These are wonderful.  Glass, but in a very protective case.  Double sided (unlike another brand that I bought at Christmas) Definitely do the job, and well protected in a case that fits perfectly in my very small crossover bag.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
    <li> Promptly delivered -- exactly what I wanted for my fingernails!!!</li>
    <li> I have short, soft nails and this file does an excellent job of leaving very smooth edges.  The size and lightweight case make it easy to carry in a purse.  As an artist, I love the sculptural look of the file...it&#x27;s like carrying a small artwork.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and great product.</li>
    <li> As described. Would purchased again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had crystal files before, but they gotten broken in my purse. This is a really nice file, &amp; the case will protect it nicely. It also puts a nice clean edge on my nail. Great file.</li>
    <li> This product was aptly named!  It&#x27;s a CLASSY nail file that I am proud to carry in my purse and use.  LOVE the case!</li>
    <li> The nail file comes in a beautiful case which is great for keeping in my purse or where ever .  The nail file itself is the best I have ever purchased and would recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I love it! It is so well made and elegant!</li>
    <li> I read about this and tried it with some skepticism, which has now been replaced with an enthusiastic endorsement.  I was surprised that something that felt so smooth itself could actually be abrasive enough to file a nail.  It does so with only a few passes, leaving a very smooth edge and a slight powder instead of a gritty residue.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Never used a Crystal Nail File before  and it is awesome.</li>
    <li> The file just arrived today.  I have used it one time and am super pleased with the quality and the smooth result.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible nail file. I had no idea it would work so well.  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic nail file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFECTIVENESS - Works really well.  If you clipped your nails in the past because it is faster, you must try this file.  It gives you much more control over the shape than nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NAIL CONDITION -  Using this has made my nails look healthier because the file leaves such a smooth edge and you don&#x27;t have to worry about any snags pulling your nails and causing chips.  I file my nails about once throughout the week while they are polished and this even leaves a smooth edge in the polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CARE - I clean my nail file once per week, though that is just because I am OCD, it could probably go a lot longer without needing to be cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to give these out as gifts because they can be universally enjoyed by anyone who cares for their nails!</li>
    <li> Love this.  It is easy on my nails and works quickly.  The case that holds it is great for carrying it in my purse.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Nail File- Smooth and Doesn&#x27;t HarmYour Nails</li>
    <li> Nails damaged from gel nails and rotary file. This file leaves my nails smooth even though I file in both directions. The file is a little thick but I can still file the corners of my nails.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but I&#x27;m hoping that it will last for a very long time!</li>
    <li> Love it, love it love it! My wife loves me for this nail file!</li>
    <li> Really nice fine grit nail file that will last a long time. It also doesn&#x27;t bend and warp like an emory board - it&#x27;s thick and strong for any job. The case is essential in keeping it in top condition. Excellent customer service and follow up from the vendor. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product and the end results.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery.  Great file.  I need another one for my purse.</li>
    <li> Read about this file in everyday cheapskate. Fabulous nail file. First one I&#x27;ve ever used where edges are smooth and no rough edges with little filing.</li>
    <li> Just exactly as pictured - maybe even better.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and in good condition with good packing.  Like it very much.  The case is very pretty and will keep the file protected and easy to find.</li>
    <li> Item arrived in excellent condition and was everything described.  It appears to work much better than any nail file I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m sure it will be admired by my sisters, who will probably want one like it.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Got here on time, everything was perfect I have used it and so far so good.</li>
    <li> This file shapes nails very quickly, and gives a smooth finish to nail edges.  Even better, my peeling nails have significantly improved and rarely peel now.</li>
    <li> SERIOUSLY THIS IS A GREAT  NAIL FILE. I have natural  nails there is no file dust or grit. It files down my toenails  too.I WILL NEVER HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER FILE AGAIN!!! A MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> My wife likes it even more than the Opi glass file.  I think that they both are excellent, but your&#x27;s has the better packaging.</li>
    <li> Great product. Super packaging. Super delivery.</li>
    <li> File is thick and difficult to use.</li>
    <li> I have never had a nail file like this.  There are no ragged edges. It files the nail smoothly, evenly and quickly. I opened the box, tried it out and immediately ordered another (I wanted a spare). If they last as long as they guarantee, it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t damage my nails.</li>
    <li> Really like this.  I&#x27;ve broken a glass file in the past, so I love that this has a case.  File is good.  Qualty product at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is a nice file. The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t get under my nails as well as a regular nail file. I do like the case it comes in and the actual file is nice. I&#x27;d recommend it if getting under your nails isn&#x27;t a big issue.  Edited my response as of March 13, 2017: I really like this nail file. It took a while to get used to the thickness and feel like my nails were cleaned. But now, I highly recommend ClassyLady Professional Crystal Glass Nail File. I also bought one for my husband after he tried mine. He really likes it also.</li>
    <li> Does a wonderful job!</li>
    <li> I came back and reordered a few more.  I love it so much that I&#x27;m fearful they&#x27;ll sell out or it just won&#x27;t be available any longer.  Don&#x27;t want to be without this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product twice. Once for me and once for family gift.  Wonderful customer service and I just love this file.</li>
    <li> The nail file is very good.  It comes in a silver case.  It is so nice.  I am going to be buying several to use as small gifts for sme friends.  Love it. I have ordered a lot of theses files.  Everyone I have given one to, loves it!  Great product and great presentation with the nice case.</li>
    <li> I love this nail file!  No longer will I be buying the flimsy ones that tear after repeated use.  The carrying case is great, too.  I purchased one for my purse and one to keep at home.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with the product.  I have nails that split all of the time and this product smooths the edges so well that they don&#x27;t have a chance to catch on something.  My other files are like harsh sand paper against my nails.  This Crystal Nail file is like satin on them.  I will be buying them as gifts for people now.</li>
    <li> The ClassyLady Professional Crystal Nail File is the best nail file I have ever used!!! Now in my 50&#x27;s and it is so effortless to use - files my ridges on my nails right down!!! Makes my nails so smooth looking!!! I am so pleased and happy with this file, plan to use it forever!!! Thanks for making such a quality product for an affordable price too!! CK  from Bellingham, WA.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all of my life Crystal Nail file!</li>
    <li> Great file! Super easy to clean and it has a nice case. Better than the one I bought at Ulta.</li>
    <li> No more emery boards.  This was recommended and I just got it, but love it so far!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Product seems to operate way above average, really haven&#x27;t used it much,as of yet.</li>
    <li> Actually it is not the finest (smoothest) crystal file I have ever used, but the case is such great protection in your purse that it is worth buying. If you have used these, you know how easily they break. Best case I have found for a file like this.</li>
    <li> Works well once you get used to it, I&#x27;m hoping it lasts a while, my husband likes it too and it&#x27;s better for your nails than emery boards or metal files because they grow stronger after :)</li>
    <li> Great file.  Timely shipping.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I think it has improved my nails.  No more peeling or splits.</li>
    <li> Great product! Quick delivery and nice follow-up.</li>
    <li> Just received item.  Good so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/29/15 Update, love this nail file.  Quality is great and the best I have used to date.  Great shocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> I would give all the nail orders I put in last week a 5 star. Everything arrived in good order and was what I had ordered. Have started using the cuticle oil already and my cuticles are looking better already.</li>
    <li> I have a different brand of crystal nail file that I bought on another website and fell in love with it. It is so much better than metal nail files or emery boards! I wanted to have a second one and decided to try this one. It is also excellent and I&#x27;m very pleased. The pretty case is a nice extra touch, and it would protect the file if carried in a purse.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read it was suggested to use while applying jamberry nail wraps.  It helps smooth out the edge of the nail, removing any jagged edges and helping your wraps stay on for longer!</li>
    <li> Great delivery and a great product. Thank u so much!</li>
    <li> Yes, I received my Crystal Nail File on time and in good shape.  I just used it an I&#x27;m happy with it.  It is the first crystal file I&#x27;ve had.  I misplaced my old diamond file and decided to try this one!  I love it...and I like the case to keep it from getting broken in my handbag.</li>
    <li> Excellent nail files. I bought one then went back and ordered three more!</li>
    <li> Gave these to the moms in my life for mothers day - very nice file with case - seems very durable and pretty.</li>
    <li> This file is wonderful.  My nails tend to be thin and brittle.  This file doesn&#x27;t damage my nails.  I will definitely recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but it looks great, and I like the case.</li>
    <li> Excellent nail file.  Leaves a very smooth clean finish.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was as advertised.  I like this item so much I have purchased a total of four. Three of them are for me to keep in different locations and one is to be a gift.  After this last order I decided to order four more as gifts.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail file I have ever used.</li>
    <li> My first glass file and I love it.  It creates very smooth nails.  I think I want one to store at work.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Would make great gift for teachers, extended family, friends, etc.  Wish I had found out about it sooner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a glass/crystal file for a while but the mall kiosk people are creepy and I didn&#x27;t want to take 2 crazy preschoolers into the beauty supply store. Wow was I surprised at the price! So glad I did go to the mall kiosk! #LOVE</li>
    <li> I love this product. The case that it comes with is very nice. It works great and I would order it again and and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like the way my nails feel after I use this file.  Have only used it 4-5 times but so far I&#x27;m liking it.  Arrived according to date.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected!  thank you! Plan to purchase more for Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> This nail file seems to work wonderfully so far. It arrived on time. The case appears to be a sturdy plastic, I thought it was metal but as long as it protects the nail file, it should be fine. Hopefully this will help my nails to stop splitting , I&#x27;m hopeful from what I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
    <li> Time to throw out all other nail files!  This is, without a doubt, a winner, and will be a stocking stuffer at Christmas!</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time and in great condition.  It was just as shown.  I&#x27;m really happy that I ordered the &amp;#34;Classy Lady Crystal Nail File&amp;#34;.  I like the case and how it fits just right in my bag.  It works well too.  Leaves my nail edges smooth. Exactly what I was shopping for.</li>
    <li> the case opens up in my purse by itself. Spending more money so that the file does not break turned out to be useless.</li>
    <li> Beautiful file, works great! Big difference from disposabl.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. Came in a nice case that protects it in my purse. I would buy another of these with no hesitation.</li>
    <li> really like, my daughter wants one now!</li>
    <li> This was a gift.  I already bought one for myself and it is really working for me, so I got this one for a friend.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of how this would work, but it came highly recommended so I gave it a try. I can&#x27;t believe how smooth this leaves my nails!  It is so quick and easy to get beautiful nails. I am so glad I bought this and am getting a second one to keep by my bed.  Update:  Just bought my second one and couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled!  Update:  My daughter liked it so much I got one for her as well.</li>
    <li> It has a nice case to protect the nail file.</li>
    <li> Love this file! Works great!</li>
    <li> My first crystal nail file and it works quite well.  Only problem for me is that I&#x27;m used to a finer point on the file to clean under my nails; I&#x27;ll adjust. The case is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> I have never had a file like this. It is amazing! I hated to file my nails till now. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I am filing but when done my nails feels so smooth !&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I found it!  :)</li>
    <li> What a wonderful nail file. Love the case. Very sophisticated!  Love it</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and intact.  My only disappointment is that the case doesn&#x27;t always stay shut.  However, I have used glass nail files before, and I love them!  I lost my last one, so that is why I ordered this.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This has worked great on my brittle nails!  The edges are very smooth!</li>
    <li> nice quality...works well</li>
    <li> I bought these as gifts, but I looked at them, and they are perfectly what I had in mind. Quality along with good presentation.</li>
    <li> Love it! Never wears down.  I love the case that it comes with.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect!  I have a glass file and this ClassyLady Crystal Nail File is just as good if not better.  I like the rough area being on both sides of the file.</li>
    <li> As a fingerstyle guitarist, I use my own fingernails to play. Both the shape and finish of my nails directly translate to the quality of tone that I&#x27;m able to produce, and so proper nail care is a must. That being said, finding a solid nail file that doesn&#x27;t leave the edges rough is a difficult task - finding a reusable one is even harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glass nail file was exactly what I needed! It&#x27;s incredibly easy to shape and smooth out my nails with it, and the semi-pointed tip allows me to get into spots I&#x27;m normally unable to with traditional emery boards and files. Durability is great so far, washing is easy, and the carrying case is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all you fingerstyle guitarists out there: get this. It&#x27;s now in my set of guitar tools and is proving invaluable in the tone production I&#x27;m able to achieve. The only con I can come up with is that it doesn&#x27;t make my nails perfectly smooth; however, if you use a nail buffer in conjunction with the file, they&#x27;ll be the last tools you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely coarser than other glass/crystal files I&#x27;ve used but it&#x27;ll do.  I do like the carrying case - hopefully it&#x27;ll keep this one in one piece.</li>
    <li> My nails, as promised, are so much smoother than when using an emery board or other nail file.  The Classy Lady Crystal nail file arrived on time in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Arrived on top and seems to work really well.  I was desperate for a new nail file and a friend recommended this.</li>
    <li> I like this glass file, its well made.  Not only files nails perfectly,  but also files rough spots around nails on toes and fingers.  A versatile tool to keep hands and feet looking well groomed.  Of course I must be careful with it since its glass not to drop it but that is a matter of using it on carpet or the bed so if it drops its safe.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this nail file that will last for years to come.  The case it comes with will keep it safe if I chose to carry it around.  Very fast shipping and great service from this shipper. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This if a superior product.  The container it comes in is a wonderful addition.</li>
    <li> Nice and elegant file to keep my fingernails smooth.</li>
    <li> i like my new file faster and smoother than than my metal file.</li>
    <li> LOVE this file! I was looking to replace a crystal nail file that a friend brought back from Italy for me. It broke on my tile floor after 10 years of use. The Classy Lady was the perfect replacement. Plus, it has a nice storage container to protect it!</li>
    <li> Ordered for my wife. Product arrived quickly. Wife says it&#x27;s the best file she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> The file works very well and the case is handy.</li>
    <li> The nail file is very nice. It leaves my nails very smooth.</li>
    <li> I just received the file.  It was delivered on time.  I like the idea of the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; that it is housed in.  Very nice feel to it.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product. This file is so much better then any other file, no ragged edges just a nice smooth edge. After I bought the first one I bought two more. My husband raves about how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a birthday gift for my 94 year old step-mother. It is very nice and she loves it. It arrives prompty and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I have never used a glass nail file before, but I like it. Plus, it comes in a nice case to carry in your purse. I would recommend. Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> This file is very easy to use and the case is very nice for it. my nails shape easily and quickly with this.</li>
    <li> I have three of these now - they are great!  I always ended up with at least one rough spot when I would use an emery board, but these crystal nail files are amazing.  I now have a really smooth, clean edge to my nails - no more snags!  I have recommended them to several people in my office.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Bought it for my wife, Usually she will take her own stuff to the nail salon. The person who did her nails, was praising about this product.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, my wife takes it with her everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great nail file! Love the case to prevent the file from being broken in half.</li>
    <li> Love it!  The only nail file I have used that filed evenly and completely. Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is definitely classy, from the carrying case to the appearance of the nail file. I&#x27;m giving one to my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Problem nails? Try this crystal file.</li>
    <li> Much  better than I ever imagined.  It&#x27;s  great!  I would recommend  this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great service and product</li>
    <li> Great file. Better quality then other glass nail files I purchased in the past.</li>
    <li> For years I have had problems with split nails. The various nail files I have used had only compounded the situation. I started using this product a few weeks ago &amp; what a difference it has made. My nails have not been splitting since I began using this nail file.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have another glass file but since it was in a felt case I was afraid to carry it in my handbag. This comes with a good looking case, so I just  purchased another for a friend.</li>
    <li> I really wonder why this product is five star. It is not rough enough and doesn&#x27;t do anything for new. I also hate the sound it causes to file:(</li>
    <li> Bought one then reordered second one</li>
    <li> Very nice nail file.  More gentle than any that I have tried including other ceramic ones.  I like it a lot.  You can see the nail being shaped as little powdery particles roll off the nail.  Does not seam to tear or damage my nails.  This is a good thing as my nails seem to peel a lot and I believe part of it is the bad nail files I have used.</li>
    <li> As advertised. No problems with purchase. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Love these nail files!  Great on your nails and I highly recommend buying them here!</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this nail file!!  It&#x27;s quick, leaves clean edges, and there&#x27;s no horrible scratching sound like with regular nail files.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I never had a good nail file before.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and haven&#x27;t had any nail splitting. Have also given a couple as gifts.</li>
    <li> Appears classy, indeed.  I bought this item because the Mary Hunt column recommended this type of file.  I appreciate the case, which allows me to keep better track of the crystal nail file.  I have used it just a little on my nails, which I found beautifully easy to smooth with this file.  The real test will come when I use it on thickened toe nails.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, jn great shape. just what I was looking for, at,s great</li>
    <li> Shipping was exceptionally fast.  And though I have not yet given myself a full manicure, I did test my new crystal nail file briefly and was impressed with how well it removed  the jagged edge on one of my nails.  The file feels amazingly smooth in action and I am impressed with how lovely it looks and the attractive case that it comes in.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering a couple of more to give as gifts for my daughters.</li>
    <li> 4 stars... only because it&#x27;s a little large for my bag.  Would love a travel size.</li>
    <li> I really like the ClassyLady Crystal Nail File. It is very gentle on my nails. The service was very fast and packaged very nicely.</li>
    <li> I love this nail file!!</li>
    <li> Best nail file ever. I&#x27;ve tried many different types of nail files. My nails would break and split. I hated how they looked. So I thought , let&#x27;s try a glass nail file. The difference in my nails is unbelievable. They are stronger. They look 100% better. I love how they look. Buying this file was well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a different file for years because the metal file seemed too harsh for my weak nails. But those break easily. Then my sister recommended this file ... and she is right! I love it.</li>
    <li> Outstanding!  Threw away all my emery boards and cheap metal Maybelline files for good.  This is a heavy duty workhorse that&#x27;s still delicate enough to slip underneath the bottom of your nail &amp; even it out.  This is my 2nd one, first one lasted almost a year before I dropped &amp; broke it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t yet used it but like the travel case it comes with so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking in my purse.</li>
    <li> What a great file!  It feels so comfortable, and makes almost no noise--for those who can&#x27;t stand the sound of someone filing their nails!  Am looking forward to using this for a l-o-n-g time!</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly.. A great product for your nails</li>
    <li> I ordered this by instruction of a uTube video on Jamberry application. I was having trouble getting the ends of the wrap to seal and not peel. Not sure if the file will help with that. Yet to be assessed. However I used the file after my first failed attempt at Jamberry application and my nails are growing and growing without peeling like they normally do. I can never grow long nails without having a protective coat of shellac. Regular polish doesn&#x27;t do the trick because it just chips and then my nails peel. Since I&#x27;ve been using this file my nails have grown with no care except this file. I guess this just speaks for glass files in general. I never knew they existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this product in particular, it came quickly. The quality of the file seems good. The case is cheap looking, not really classy but it does the job. Not sure if I got the best deal for the price. I think there are other sets of three different grades for the same price. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo of 3 weeks of growth, no peeling after peeling off Jamberry and only care is filing with this file.</li>
    <li> The file  seems to work well. However, I have never used a glass file before and there were no instructions on best-use techniques, how to clean it properly, etc.  Would really have appreciated some info.</li>
    <li> Loved the glass file that I ordered more for gifts.</li>
    <li> Hi: I have never used a crystal nail file and I LOVE IT! Thank you for opening my eyes to this great product. I will be ordering more for my friends as they will want to take mine once they see how great it does your nails :-)</li>
    <li> Excellent  Crystal nail file</li>
    <li> This file leaves my nails very smooth without the grating sound of other files. The case is an extra plus; it is easier to find in my purse and keeps the file clean and safe. It&#x27;s very classy looking. I plan on making a second purshase</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, Quality item! A great buy!</li>
    <li> Came quickly, all in tact. I love the little case that comes with it, even though it&#x27;s plastic and cheap, it works well enough to protect the crystal from breaking. I&#x27;ve kept it in my purse and so far so good! It&#x27;s definitely a good file; it&#x27;ll eat your nail up if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this nail file once, so far, but I already love it better than any nail file I have used in the past! I have very fragile nails and it has been difficult to get ones that work well for me.  However, this nail file is IT for me from now on. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> I love this nail file! It really is very classy looking and it does a great job. I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> Great service and great product.</li>
    <li> The Classy Lady Crystal Nail File is a great product. It works well, and I appreciate that the seller wanted to make sure that I was happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Works great.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other glass nail files and the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; is just glued on.  They do not last, nor are they as nice to your nails.&lt;br /&gt;This file is very well made.  I wish the cap to the case fit a little tighter, but oh well.</li>
    <li> I love this file. It is gentle, yet effective.</li>
    <li> I have never used a glass file before but I will never go back to gritty emery boards again! LOVE...LOVE...this file!!</li>
    <li> Great nail file. It really will last forever, at least if I don&#x27;t drop it. I would buy it again!!</li>
    <li> Very good and fast.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works great, has a smoother grain than I&#x27;m used to but it leaves a nice finish. I like the case, small but protective. Seller was prompt, no complaints</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product. Had to order a second one because my daughter &amp;#34;misplaced&amp;#34; the first one.</li>
    <li> I have used this 2x as for now love it !! Reminds me of a well know more expensive brand .</li>
    <li> Wonderful file. Works fast on my thin damaged nails. Doesn&#x27;t leave a rough surface to catch on everything either.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions on the website everydaycheapskate (not affiliated) and purchased this file.  I had never heard of one.  using this and the other suggested items has given me the ability to give up my weekly gel nail appt.  Everyone has been getting them as gifts!</li>
    <li> Having a case makes it great to carry it in my purse. Very good product. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> exactly what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> I love my Classy Lady glass nailfile. Better than an emery board. I plan to order more for Christmas stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best nail files.  Love that it comes in a case that isn&#x27;t thin leather  The file will last and so will the case.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and as described. Looking forward to using it.</li>
    <li> I love these nail files. I gave one to my daughter, daughter - in- law, and mother - in- law and they all really like them. You just have to be careful not to drop them because they are glass.</li>
    <li> Worked great no nail snags.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Fast delivery.  Owned Trind glass file at a cost of $76 to replace.  Works as well.  Definite buy</li>
    <li> This is a very nicely presented (packaged) and functional nail file.  Everything has a feel of luxury.  Nicely executed product.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Wonderful file. Great quality. Not abrasive. No rough edges as with metal files. Nice carrying case. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have be using the glass or crystal nail files for some time but they never came with a case.  Consequently I have broken every one, and not always by dropping.  Perhaps this one will last me longer.  The case is small and stylish and won&#x27;t take up too much room in your purse.  I really like this.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Works great with my Jamberry nail wraps! Dboyle.jamberrynails.net</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 the first time I placed an order.  This nail file is terrific.  It does not drag across the nail, is extremely sharp, yet will not cut your finger.  This files takes less pressure to use on your nails and seems to be excellent at shaping almost immediately.  It requires less time to sculpt your nails than an emery board or metal nail file.  It is very smooth.  I will be purchasing this product for ladies Birthdays and Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Classy Lady Beauty Products was incredibly unprofessional and disrespectful and I regret ever making this purchase .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the minute (literally the minute, their emails must be linked to the tracking info) they were able to determine that I had received my nail file I was hounded with requests for a review. I did not particularly like their nail file, preferring ones I had purchased at Sally&#x27;s. However I didn&#x27;t dislike it enough to really warrant a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After literally countless emails (even after I clicked the link that supposedly unsubscribed you from their emails multiple times and got a confirmation that I was supposedly unsubscribed) I feel like there is literally no other option than to adhere to their demands.  Maybe after this I will feel like I can safely check my email without being bombarded by ceaseless requests for a nail file review. Or maybe they will just continue and I will spend the rest of my life regretting that fateful afternoon I so foolishly thought I could purchase a nail file from a company on Amazon without lasting negative repercussions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously people, it&#x27;s just a nail file, my review is not going to change lives, unlike your emails which, on a weekly basis, significantly increase my stress levels and  decrease my quality of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had never bought this nail file. I have literally never regretted a purchase more, not even the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; dancing puppets that in the end were just held up and moved with tiny pieces of string and just flopped on its face when I (a 7 year old) tried to stand it up on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it, that is my review, please stop harassing me about leaving a review for your nail file. If you were a telemarketer(which is the closest thing I can relate this to aside from cyber bullying) what you are doing would be illegal.</li>
    <li> This item was recommended to me and it is wonderful.  I believe I have found the best nail file ever.</li>
    <li> I received the Crystal nail file and love that it comes in a case for your purse.  It files the nails smoothly without any effort. Great product!  I will probably buy another to keep with my nail accessories.</li>
    <li> What an awesome nail file! It gets your nails filed quick and easy. Great product for the money!</li>
    <li> Best file I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by it...</li>
    <li> it arrived early and can&#x27;t wait to use it. I ordered two, one is a gift.</li>
    <li> Nice full size file with case.  Shipping was fast. Great quality, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Best file I have every used. Talked my sister into buying it and she also loves it.</li>
    <li> Best nail file I have ever used. It files and smooths the nail at the same time. It fits into a convenient case that snaps shut. It will be handy for traveling and will fit in any purse. I will never use a metal file again. I hope it lasts forever. Also, it looks lovely and very classy. I don&#x27;t think there is a better one on the market and I am glad I spent a few extra dollars for this one. I was never aware of crystal glass nail files before and so this came as a pleasant surprise, specifically the high quality of the item and its ease of use and effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing a glass nail file. I&#x27;m a lifelong nail chewer but my New Years resolution was to grow my nails out. So far so good, but I didn&#x27;t like the filed I found a Walmart. Someone suggested a glass nail file and this is the one I purchased. I LOVE it. The edges of my nail are smooth instead of ragged, and it&#x27;s easy to clean and there is no residue. Highly suggest this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased six of these (one for myself and the others as gifts).  They work great!  You actually have to be careful because you can easily file too much but so much better than all the other files I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
    <li> This file is magnificent!!!!  I got one for home and one for my purse.  It is really gentle on the nail and it seals the nail as well to prevent any jagged edges.  Mad I didn&#x27;t know about this file sooner :)  Luv it!!!</li>
    <li> Received my order ahead of schedule and am very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail file for only a few weeks, but I love it so far.  It does a great job of filing my nails and doesn&#x27;t fall apart after a few uses like a typical nail file.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is that the case it came with doesn&#x27;t stay closed very well, so I&#x27;m often fishing in my purse for the cap.</li>
    <li> My mother wanted a glass nail file for her birthday, and has so far been loving this product. She really liked the fact that it comes with a protective case</li>
    <li> I ordered multiple crystal and glass files and received all of them today--the predicted delivery date.  I tried all of them and do not find much difference among them.  Two had protective cases.  Two sets included cuticle tools that I really like.  My nails look and feel better after just one use.  The edges are smoother and the ridges are less noticeable.  I hope that they will continue to improve as I use the files.</li>
    <li> Love this heavyweight nail file.  The glass files really are the best but many are so lightweight that they break easily in packing in luggage.  This one is more quality, and the case stays together to protect the file. The &amp;#34;particles&amp;#34; on the files are also high quality in that some I have tried won&#x27;t really file your nails.</li>
    <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS AWESOME! I HAVE NEVER USED A GREAT FILE BEFORE! MY NAILS ARE SOOOOO SMOOTH. I WISH I HAD GOTTEN THIS YEARS AGO. NO SNAGGY  NAILS ANYMORE!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this file.  It does an excellent job of filing as much or as little as you want, hasn&#x27;t damaged any nail I&#x27;ve filed.  If it lasts as long as it&#x27;s supposed to it will definitely be worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very elegant and well working.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it the second time BUT I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. And handy enough to leave by my chair, so it&#x27;s quick to be used. Possibly a little thicker than I thought, but it does the job well.</li>
    <li> I ordered the ClassyLady Crystal Nail File for my Mother as part of her Mother&#x27;s Day gift and then decided to order one for myself.  It&#x27;s my first time trying a crystal nail file and I do like it.  Delivery was as expected as I am a Amazon Prime customer.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and the seller.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nails have much smoother edge after using this versus an emory board.</li>
    <li> . It makes my fingernails so smooth I&#x27;. Not making any tear in my fingernail I had been getting manicures but the Emory boards make my nails so weak my thumb nail folded in half while I was buttoning my jeans. I will bring my classy lady next time I get a manicure. My only complaint is that they should redesign the handle so is more comfortable to hold itAdditional update please be extra careful when washing the handle is extremely slippery when it is wet Washed mine the other day and it slid out of my hand and broke in 1/2 It landed in our corian sink . it broke in 1/2 even though only about 6 &amp;#34; above sink It&#x27;s a great product Although they should change the handle so it will be easier to hold. Since their directions instruct soapy water they should make it easier to hold when it is wet..</li>
    <li> Quality product, well make and packaged. Would make a great gift item for someone.</li>
    <li> Love this nail file!  Money well spent.  This is the best file I&#x27;ve ever used.  Totally recommend this!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, as promised, in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Definitely leaves nails smoother than standard file. BUT the feel of the glass file is like nails on a chalkboard. I have to be very careful to only go slow and in one direction. A slight variance means I get the willies and creepy crawlies from the icky feel of this file. That being said, I will continue to use it before manicures and for touch ups as the result is worth it. I will just have to toughen up to the icky feel...</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift, so don&#x27;t know much about it.  But, it is attractive.  Like a piece of glass with a fine sanding area.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to have rough and fine sides; they seem about the same. The case is a nice silvery metal one.  The box is a fancy silver cardboard.</li>
    <li> Works well and definitely worth the price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have never owned a glass file before and after this one I will never not own one!  It files so smooth and cleanly, I love it !  There is a HUGE difference between this file and metal ones.  I have filed everyone&#x27;s nails upon getting this just today.</li>
    <li> Best mail file EVER for jamberry nail wraps.</li>
    <li> Love this nail file.  Files very smoothly w/ little effort.  Has nice case w/it also. The service from this company was quick and on time.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Best nail file ever!</li>
    <li> Received very fast! One of the best items I have used. The glass file is very fast. No sawing away as usual. If is a great product! I have been giving them for birthdays, Christmas presents. etc. A little something extra to put with their gift. THANKS!!</li>
    <li> Broken upon arrival. Very disappointing. Comes in its own protective case so it&#x27;s hard to imagine this happened in transit....</li>
    <li> I love it so much that I ordered one for my daughter for her birthday. Nice quality!</li>
    <li> I have only started using it -- but it is very good quality and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a glass file that my husband misplaced.  He liked it so.much and was really upset when he could not find it.  So he took it upon himself to.order this one.  After we received this one he found the misplaced one.  Now we are both happy.</li>
    <li> I just received it . Very fast. It is just wonderful. The best I have had ever.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item only because the ClassyLady large crystal nail file was not available.  Would prefer the large one over this one, it doesn&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
    <li> The Nail file works great and I like the case it is really classy. Thank you so much for a beautiful product.</li>
    <li> Very good the only one I use now</li>
    <li> I read about ClassyLady Crystal Nail Files in Mary Hunt&#x27;s Everyday Cheapskate email.  Her recommendations are spot on and this is no exception. My daughter and I have tried several of these crystal files. We have been disappointed with the &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; filing and the short life of these files.  ClassyLady knocks it our of the park!  I hope they come out with a bigger one for feet soon!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Prior to using the ClassyLady Pro Crystal Nail File I had only ever used drugstore emery boards and after about a week of using this nail file, I love it!  I noticed the difference immediately.  Great size even for larger than avg. hands (I am six feet tall).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law.  She is thrilled with it, and is happy to have a file that treats her nails well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Gentle and makes your nails look clean when used underneath the nail.</li>
    <li> The file arrived before the promised date and was very attractive.</li>
    <li> This product is a godsend for nails. I&#x27;ve always hated nail files because of the uneven grittiness and leftover nail bits they leave behind. This file works extremely fast (if you file too fast and not in one direction, your nail will be gone before you know it) and has an interesting feel that takes a bit of getting used to, but it leaves your nails perfectly even and incredibly smooth. A must buy if you love caring for your nails</li>
    <li> seems to be a great product!  files fingernails quickly and smoothly, i do love the case to help protect it from breaking</li>
    <li> Just used this for the first time and I LOVE it! It felt much better on my nail than a regular filing board, didn&#x27;t feel like it was chewing up my nail. It also didn&#x27;t feel or sound like nail on a chalkboard, which I was afraid of. Overall, great purchase, even came earlier than I expected!</li>
    <li> Very nice, works well, and is durable, too. I&#x27;ve already dropped mine in a parking lot with no harm done.</li>
    <li> I love this nail file - it&#x27;s far more effective than any I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> A fantastic product which lives up to its hype.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS NAIL FILE!!! I have bought multiple crystal files, and ALL of them have had the grit wear away. Classy Lady file has lasted and still works PERFECTLY . It has a smooth glide, and it never wears down or comes off like other brands I&#x27;ve used. It comes in a nice case that stays closed too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a massage therapist, and I need to keep my nails well manicured, so I use this file often and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I have even bought it as a gift to others!</li>
    <li> Works great,  very nice file</li>
    <li> I really like this file!</li>
    <li> very classy and the case keeps it secure</li>
    <li> great items to have on hand at all times. happy i was introduced to this by a co-worker</li>
    <li> Best nail file I have ever used! Super impressed!</li>
    <li> Works well and very smooth. Case a little cheap, but file is nice</li>
    <li> Love these glass files!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, price and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a nail file for years.  I have extremely soft nails.  All of the files on the market are too rough causing my nails to split and crack.  After filling with diamond files I would put snag in my hosiery.  The emory boards would cause my nails to break prematurely, sometimes below the quick.  The crystal ones just didn&#x27;t do the job and my nails were uneven and rough.  For the first time in a long time my nails are smooth, strong and pretty.  This file smooths them so well they are actually growing.  There are no chips or rough edges to catch on things and force them to tear.  I plan to buy several more for myself and as gifts.</li>
    <li> I did not care for the file as first as it felt like I was using chalkboard to file nails. After I got used to it I absolutely love this file. If you want super smooth nails this is for you.</li>
    <li> This is my second crystal nail file. The first (from another company) wasn&#x27;t anything to get excited about - did the job but didn&#x27;t wow. When that one shattered I tried to go back to regular nail files but it wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I saw this one had a good rating and thought I&#x27;d give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did! My nails are prone to splitting and this file does a great job of giving a clean file. Never going back to regular nail files again. I also appreciated the email I received asking me to check if there was damage. With something so delicate it&#x27;s nice to know the seller cares.</li>
    <li> I really like this nail file. I have very fragile nails, the ClassyLady fileshapes and smooths my nails, unlike most files or vemory boards that leave my nails with little tiny rough spots that catch on some fabrics or my own hair that eventually cause them to tear. I also like the silver case. I purchased 3 of them, one to keep upstairs, one downstairs and one in my purse.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this nail file!!!  Very fine, very classy (the name doesn&#x27;t lie).  Will be purchasing more from this seller.</li>
    <li> I never knew there was a file available like this now I wont ever go back to the cheapos. This thing is great I love it, also good for a gift idea!</li>
    <li> Crystal nail files are new to me. I read where Dr. Oz recommended them and decided to try it. IT works perfect, no ragged edges.</li>
    <li> Thank you!  My Mother was wanting one to replace an older one, and she will be delighted.</li>
    <li> Love this nail file. I never realized filing could be smooth.</li>
    <li> Crystal nail files are my favorite.  I have several of them so I can usually take one with me.  Quick delivery much appreciated.</li>
    <li> Awesome-had to order another one as a gift for someone. Thick file and every surface is useable-sides and point included. Never saw a nail file like this in my life and I&#x27;m 66. Glad I&#x27;ll never have to use an emery board file again.</li>
    <li> Just started using this nail file and it is working like a dream.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best nail file I have ever had.  It smooths ragged nails better than emery boards and with much less work.  I also really like the case that it comes in.  It keeps the file in good condition and looks very elegant.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of a crystal nail file until recently.  I decided to check it out as I am tired of cheaper metal files that wear out and don&#x27;t file.  This is the first crystal nail file I have ever used, and I love it.  It files very quickly and very smoothly.  It is a little thick as some commented, but I do not find that a problem.  You do not need a file going under your nail for it to file.  I have very short nails as I play instruments and need to keep them super short.  I have no problem using this file, just use it perpendicularly to the nail.  This file can be used on either side, and is very nice quality.  I plan on getting another, and this is the only one I would consider.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail file. It is so much better than using a metal one and keeps the edges of nails soft. The first one arrived broken due to poor handling during shipping, but the refund was processed quickly and I ordered a new one right away. The second one has been great for me and is perfect for filing my nails to the right shape quickly.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Great service, classy file!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice nail file, this nail file is high in quality. I loved that it came with a case I would recommend this to any one looking for a high quality nail file.</li>
    <li> Love the nail file.  Very prompt service</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lovely object, it arrived quickly, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything! The only place on the file that&#x27;s rough enough to do anything is the edge, and that&#x27;s not good for filing down long nails. I bought it based on all the stellar reviews I read about how fast it was to shape your nails, but if I use the flat side I feel like I&#x27;m buffing rather than filing. If I&#x27;m doing it wrong, I wish someone would correct me, otherwise I just threw away a lot of good money!</li>
    <li> It really is a Classy file. Very smart looking and great, smooth operation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a classical guitarist, and this is the best filer I ever used. A+</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality crystal nail file and I love the elegant silver case as well.</li>
    <li> Great price and product as advertised.</li>
    <li> Liked the crystal nail file so much - got 2 more.....additional review - now have purchased 8 nail files and give them as gifts - they are the best file ever   another review in December 2016 - these are the best nail files - have ordered 10 more - will give them as Christmas gifts...to my nail salon persons.</li>
    <li> What nice packaging; I just love the protective case. It costs a bit more, but I expect to have use of this file for years to come.</li>
    <li> My wife want two more.  One for the bathroom, one for her desk, while this one is in her purse.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> my nails are very smooth after using the file and my polish doesn&#x27;t chip after using it.  I also like the case that keeps it clean!</li>
    <li> Love, LOVE this very fine grained file!  Ordering more!!!!</li>
    <li> Does a beautiful job, quickly, and leaves my nails smooth, not jagged like emery boards.</li>
    <li> I thought it is not rough enough to file but it does. Ive been looking for a really good nail to go with my jamberry application because nail file you can buy in bulk doesnt do its job. I am hoping i can use for this a longer time.</li>
    <li> Much smoother than emery!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a Classy nail file.  It leaves my nails shaped and smooth.  The lightweight case is a plus, keeping the file clean as well protected from breakage.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best file I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this file. The little carry case is a plus, I&#x27;m sure she would break it without. Great shipping and communication from seller.</li>
    <li> Great file, bought extras for gifts!</li>
    <li> This is the only file I will ever own again,  You actually do less filing with this file, it leaves a nice smooth edge.  It is classy, of course, when I pull it out of my purse, everyone wants to try it.  I&#x27;ve purchased two but I need a couple more because I want one left on my nightstand, one in  my office, etc.  You will not be disappointed.  11/01/15  Just ordered another one as a gift for a friend who used it &amp; loved it also.</li>
    <li> High quality-not only does it look great, it is a superb nail file</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a glass nail file before (misplaced it) so I knew how great they are. I ordered this one with a bit of trepidation as I didn&#x27;t know anything about the seller. However, the nail file was shipped promptly and as advertised. I love the fact that it has its own case! I&#x27;ve used it several times and am very happy with it. Buy this one and you&#x27;ll have a perfect nail file for life!</li>
    <li> I would recommoned this nail file and would buy it again. It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;ll never become dull - so totally worth it. It comes in a great case to protect it. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little thick, so getting under the edge of your nails, if they&#x27;re short, can put you at weird angles. It grounds the nail down to a fine dust and leaves the edge smooth and manicure-ready - none of those jagged edges of coarse nail files.</li>
    <li> Terrific file, my nails have never looked better. I have very thin nails that are prone to splitting  and bending. This file is very gentle and makes it easier to shape my nails without tearing them up. Great price as well.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly as described, well packaged and promptly delivered. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this!!  It is better than a regular file.</li>
    <li> After many years of acrylics, I decided to try a &amp;#34;makeover&amp;#34; on my nails using strengtheners, etc. and this crystal nail file has been a great tool. It&#x27;s very gentle on my nails, yet it shapes them easily in a very controlled, precise way. I&#x27;m never in danger of over-filing, which would sometimes happen with regular files. The case is also very handy to keep it safe.</li>
    <li> Excellent file and exactly what I was looking for.  The case it comes with keeps the file from rolling around in my purse and scratching everything it comes in contact with.  Also, this files and smooths my nails.  The grit is fine enough to clean any snags or rough edges, but will also file my nail down quickly if I need to remove a little length.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a replacement, as my wife had fallen on her purse.  She is fine, but the nail file broke into pieces.  She said it was the best nail file she&#x27;s ever owned.</li>
    <li> Love it...Great product and service</li>
    <li> The file smooths nails well.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have used for 2 weeks and am happy so far.</li>
    <li> Nail files came quickly and are simply wonderful!</li>
    <li> I got two of these for my mom and aunt for Mothers day. They both love these files.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this file. It does just what it is suppose to, seals the ends of my dry easy to split nails.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, and nice file, but case was cheaper feeling than I expected.</li>
    <li> Really easy on the nails and it comes in a nice carry case.</li>
    <li> Exudes class in every aspect of form and function.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best file I have ever used.  Be careful not to drop it because it will break. Mine did and I immediately ordered another! Customer service is  perfect!</li>
    <li> It is a very smooth and soft way to do the nails. I really like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this file for my niece and she was absolutely thrilled with it.  She told me her nails were never so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Her best and simple testimony was:  Love it, Love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent service; and, just what my wife was looking for! Of course, she picked it out. ; )</li>
    <li> This is a great file.  It is thicker than the ones I have purchased in the past so I think it will be less prone to break. It also comes with a case, which is great because my old one only had a sleeve.</li>
    <li> The best nail file I&#x27;ve had! It files and smooth nails, not leaving any rough spots on them. I don&#x27;t usually write comments, but this one deserves a great one. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this file it tapers my nails nicely. This file is not made to clean under the nail, but is very effective at filing and shaping and smoothing out catches in the nail.</li>
    <li> Great quality.  The case is fantastic. That&#x27;s why I keep using them.  Only drawback, it is made of glass &amp;amp; will break if dropped.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, high quality nail file.  It is nice and rough, and after using it, it is very easy to clean.  The case fits it well, and overall I like the product.  There is one star missing because the file itself is so thick that I can&#x27;t slide it between my nails and fingertip to get hangnails.</li>
    <li> I love it! Its a lot better than the ones from walmart.</li>
    <li> I like to bring a nail file with me in my purse to take care of splits and chips at work but nail files will destroy your phone screen, watch, glasses ect. I bought this to have a nice case to keep it from scratching things in my purse but it is also a really nice file in general. It doesn&#x27;t wear down like an emery board does (I hate the feeling of running my nails along a worn emery board-it&#x27;s like a chalk board to me!). It also has a nice substantial hand feel to it and is easy to grip. Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> The nail file is amazing, I don&#x27;t have to file my nails constantly.  I file them once a week and I am done, no snags, no missed spots.  My nails look good and don&#x27;t drive me crazy by needing to be filed all the time.  I am going to purchase several of these as gifts.  Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it and I will probably get more and give them out as gifts</li>
    <li> Remarkable nail file that works better than any I&#x27;ve ever used and one I highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> This is my second Crystal nail file. My grand-daughter permanently borrowed the first. :-)</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works great. The case to store it is very classy looking as well.</li>
    <li> Very good quality file!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I am very happy with the price and imit even has its own case I&#x27;ve used it numerous times now and looka brand new.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she loves it and says it works well and is very smooth and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;This is a high-quality glass nail file that works as it should: it is strong enough to file down long nails, but smooth enough that it will not damage your nails. The file itself is a solid piece of glass. The box (top item in the photo) is just cardboard packaging. The holder, however, was a bit disappointing. Though it looks metal in the picture, it is actually very cheap-looking (though protective) plastic.</li>
    <li> I love this nail file.</li>
    <li> I really like this nail file.  It took some getting used to since I&#x27;ve only ever used emery boards.  The case is nice so I can carry it in my purse.  It makes the nail smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been a longtime user of these nail files.  However, they are very hard to find and sometimes the quality is lacking . Was delighted to find them on Amazon. I bought two as I am lost without my nail file so I really like the attractive carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see where there are questions about breakage. These are made of some kind of tempered glass that resists breaking. I have dropped mine a few times on a hardwood floor and it only bounced. Did have one break one time into two pieces which I continued to use. We all have breakable things we use, just take care of it and it will last a really long time. I have never had one &amp;#34;wear out&amp;#34; and its more than 10 years old and used a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was really fast.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of a crystal nail file until I read a description of this on Amazon.  I love it.  It leaves the edge of my  nails smoother than ever.  I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Love this file! Used others before and didn&#x27;t like them much. I love how this one comes in a very slim classy case.</li>
    <li> I never had a glass file before so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to, however it worked great on my natural nails and to take off excess jamberry nails stickers.  (Which is why I purchased it. Someone recommended using glass files with jamberry&#x27;s.)</li>
    <li> Verrrrrrrry nice!  Much better than emery boards.  I&#x27;m a guitarist, so proper nail care is a must.  This item is heads and shoulders over emery boards and metal nail files.</li>
    <li> Good file. Best my nails have looked in a while.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Very easy to use, I won&#x27;t go back to the nail files.</li>
    <li> I was dubious at first but am now a believer. I am 70 yrs old and was a card carrying member of Revlon&#x27;s Emery Board till it disappeared. It is glass so I&#x27;d recommend filing while seated.</li>
    <li> Really love this file!  Will try to come back and update after some time but I believe it will last :)  Would highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Nice file, but case is very cheap plastic.</li>
    <li> Exceptional nail file.  Best I&#x27;ve ever used, due to its smoothness in filing and nail finish.  I was skeptical until I used the product.  First rate.  Will only purchase ClassyLady Crystal Nail File from now on.</li>
    <li> This nail file is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I just purchased my 3rd one:  one for my purse, one for bedside table, one for table by my reading chair.  Save money by buying the file in a plastic sleeve.  The silver case made of plastic isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> Very nice file.  The only negative that I&#x27;ve encountered is that all 4 sides are files.  So, while you&#x27;re filing your nails, the edge of the file is cutting your skin.  It would be fine to use if you have long nails, but if you file close, it will harm your skin.</li>
    <li> Best file ever.  I have very thin fragile nails.  Most files do more damage but this one leaves a nice clean smooth edge.  Planning on buying some for all my girls (and maybe some of the guys!)</li>
    <li> Great nail file!  Love that it won&#x27;t wear out.</li>
    <li> Very nice nail file. Will buy more for friends.</li>
    <li> I really like this nail file. I have been using crystal files for several years now, and this is the best one I have tried.  The case is great, and I am going to order a second set for my purse. I was always hesitant to put one in my purse before for fear of breaking it or scratching things inside.  Not anymore!</li>
    <li> BEST  NAIL  FILE  EVER!!!  Leaves nails smooth with no ragged edges. Am buying two more for gifts.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my mother. I asked her how she likes it, and this is what she wrote to me:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The nail file is terrific. It looks so elegant to put in my bag. It&#x27;s good to carry a file with me. My nails crack like crazy and also it works so well. It is special. If you don&#x27;t have one then get one. Thanks so much for that bit of luxury.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I will listen to my mom and get one too</li>
    <li> This is the first glass file I&#x27;ve used. It works wonderfully - it takes a little getting used to as you hardly need any pressure (I&#x27;m used to having to press a lot harder), but by the third nail I had the hang of it. Great product!</li>
</ol>
