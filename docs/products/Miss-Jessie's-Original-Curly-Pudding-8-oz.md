      <li>You would come out better using regular lotion.  </li>
      <li>You pay $14 for the mixed roots product and receive more for your money.     </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair light and bouncy and shiny, but not heavy and greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>A little heavy for my fine hair, so it causes some build-up, but makes my curls real nice.</li>
      <li>I have tried pretty much every hair product out there</li>
      <li>The large jar is $48 bucks</li>
      <li>Because of the fact that there really are not any products out there that work well on curly/natural hair</li>
      <li>and it is very sticky.  </li>
      <li>I wash my hair (which is very curly) and apply by combing it through with my fingers or a rat tailed comb.  </li>
      <li>My mistake but very misleading as I buy my daughter these about every 2-3 months.</li>
      <li>I have tried other products for curly hair that are much better.  </li>
      <li>I still have almost a full bottle left.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of the cream and leaves my curls soft without the need to use other products.</li>
      <li>Carols Daughter and my new found favorites Taliah Waajid Protective Mist Bodifier and Kinky curl leavin in conditioner.</li>
      <li>I am really glad I tried this, as I am one of those girls with a drawer full of mousse, spray, gel, and other stuff that doesn&#x27;t tame my frizz.</li>
      <li>Many reviews are saying it is heavy and greasy, then you are definitely using too much.  </li>
      <li>When It was time to look for new products that would work for my natural hair, I dreaded it because I didn&#x27;t want to become a \\&quot;product junckie\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>just watch you dont use too much at once, start off ith only a nickle size in the palm of your hand.</li>
      <li>wakes up the curls, makes my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I applied some of it to my hair, and my hair came out SO shiny and so soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Pillow Soft curls, but that doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair soft too.</li>
      <li>It did make it soft</li>
      <li>I am in the midst of transitioning from perm to natural.  </li>
      <li>I did meet another lady in the dermatology office who had a natural look</li>
      <li>I have been natural for 3 years.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly and good hair, and this made my hair hard and stiff.</li>
      <li>My hair is so big that using it as a curl holder when wet will cause me to use way too much of the product.  </li>
      <li>I was excited when I rceived my purchase which was delivered ontime, however, this product does not agree with my hair, it made my hair dry and stiff after I use it.</li>
      <li>and my hair is voluminous and curly, or my favorite thing to do is let it air dry a bit at night and then sleep on it; in the morning I have soft wavy tendrils and little to no frizz (and very little styling time needed).</li>
      <li>I recently cut my locs after 15 years, so being natural is not new for me.</li>
      <li>My hair is naturally curly/coily and this product dried my hair completely out!  </li>

<li> Not to mention, whenever I tried a braid out/twist out it left my hair so flat with a TON of frizz.</li>
<li> No sheen, or shine, just a dry, white looking residue shortly after the application.  </li>
<li> but there was a lot of flaking and it somewhat was flat looking in a way that I did not like.  </li>
<li> It left some parts of my hair feeling &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; and dry.</li>
<li> Goes a long way when using as a set for twist or braid outs.</li>
<li> Complete waste of money.</li>
<li> I tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding a few years ago when I was transitioning from permed to natural hair.</li>

<li> I can let this stuff air dry</li>
<li> You can sit under the dryer to also dry your hair under the dryer or let it air dry.  </li>
<li> I have always wanted to wear my natural curly hair without looking crazy but couldn&#x27;t find the right product.</li>
<li> But when you get down to the nuts and bolts, it&#x27;s got the same hold as other gels and holding products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> maybe I was using a bit too much of it, but my hair is very thick to begin with.</li>
<li> Jessie&#x27;s was not really what I expected.  </li>
<li> This product took my head of very soft but somewhat frizzy waves and loose curls and turned it into a hard, contracted mess.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> but you should only use a little bit at a time so it should last a couple of months at least.  </li>
<li> I was not satisfied with the results especially considering the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awful...this product did NOTHING for me but made me waste money!</li>
    <li> I am 2 months post big chop and i have about 2 inches of hair growth.  My hair is naturally curly/coily and this product dried my hair completely out!  No sheen, or shine, just a dry, white looking residue shortly after the application.  I will try once my hair grows out a little more, but right now did NOT have good results.</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavey hair. I have tried pretty much every hair product out there and this is by far my favorite! This is one of the few products that does not make my hair crunchy. My hair also seems to be curlier when I use this product:) The leave in conditioner is also awesome&#x27;</li>
    <li> I tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Pudding a few years ago when I was transitioning from permed to natural hair. What a mistake! My hair felt hard and started to flake when I worked it through my hair. There are better products out there and use natural ingredients. Also the price is ridiculous..</li>
    <li> This stuff is way overpriced for what you get.  It somewhat reduces frizz and defines curls, but that&#x27;s only after applying the suggested 1/2 jar to your head. It takes forever to dry and leaves your hair feeling heavy and greasy.  But the worst part is the flaking.  Once it has finally dried and you are scrunching and pulling to create that lustrous body that they promise, you&#x27;ll start to see the white flakes falling out of your hair and so excessive to the point where it looks like you&#x27;ve just powdered your hair (and shoulders) or worse yet like you have a severe dandruff problem.  I can&#x27;t begin to describe the embarrassment this product has caused me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I am white with European background who has frizzy, wavy, curly, unruly hair. I can let this stuff air dry and my hair is voluminous and curly, or my favorite thing to do is let it air dry a bit at night and then sleep on it; in the morning I have soft wavy tendrils and little to no frizz (and very little styling time needed). I am really glad I tried this, as I am one of those girls with a drawer full of mousse, spray, gel, and other stuff that doesn&#x27;t tame my frizz. Very happy.</li>
    <li> This works great for my teeny weeny afro! I just recently cut off my relaxed hair. When It was time to look for new products that would work for my natural hair, I dreaded it because I didn&#x27;t want to become a \\&quot;product junckie\\&quot;. I ordered Miss Jessie&#x27;s and it was perfect! I have about 2 months of growth and it really brought out my curls! It was vary light andit didn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy at all! My only complaint is that its so expensive! BUT I guess you have to pay a pretty penny for something that really works!</li>
    <li> I received my miss jessie&#x27;s curly pudding...I have only used it once since I changed my mind for the type of hairstyle I am going to get.  I am in the midst of transitioning from perm to natural.  I did try the product when I first received it and it gives my hair a nice texture finish and shine.  I have decided to go ahead and cut off the rest of the perm and then I will resume using ms jessie&#x27;s pudding to create my bantu knots/double strand look.  I did meet another lady in the dermatology office who had a natural look and I was in awe of her style and how healthy yet shiny her hair was.  She raved that she achieved the look with the help of ms jessie&#x27;s pudding.  Said she would not leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my step-daughter&#x27;s wiley tight curly hair.  I was not satisfied with the results especially considering the price. It did make it soft but there was a lot of flaking and it somewhat was flat looking in a way that I did not like.  I know some ladies with girls who swear by the stuff.  Not sure if I used it wrong or just one of those hair texture things where it works for one but not the other. I love Miss Jessies creme de la creme but not the pudding.  I still have almost a full bottle left.</li>
    <li> This product took my head of very soft but somewhat frizzy waves and loose curls and turned it into a hard, contracted mess. I don&#x27;t know for whom this product was intended but for the price I hope others get better results, though I can&#x27;t imagine how. To top it off my hair is now crunchy and puffy aka \\&quot;Breakfast Cereal.\\&quot; Speaking of which, I can only imagine what this will look like in the morning so, I&#x27;m off to rewash my hair.... P.S. the hardness doesn&#x27;t wash away! I&#x27;m sticking to drugstore brand gels, no reason to be ugly AND broke.</li>
    <li> Jessie&#x27;s was not really what I expected.  I believe it did not give me the shine as well as cutting down the frizzie look of the hair as indicated.  When I reviewed the internet and saw the demonstrators, I noticed their hair is 1) they have a nice grain of hair as well as curly, whereas Jessie&#x27;s probably enhanced their hair a little more.</li>
    <li> This stuff was no different than the other moisturizers out there except for the fact that it is very expensive.  Because of the fact that there really are not any products out there that work well on curly/natural hair this stuff is selling.  You would come out better using regular lotion.  There is nothing to brag about with this hair product.  I was not impressed.  Very disappointing.  It smells nice however the smell does not last and it is very sticky.  Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works well on twist outs, but product is so dang expensive!!!!  I can only afford to use this product when I do twist or braid outs due to it&#x27;s cost...My hair is so big that using it as a curl holder when wet will cause me to use way too much of the product.  Goes a long way when using as a set for twist or braid outs.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the description.  I have not used it yet, so I cannot evaluate it.  Rating is based on description</li>
    <li> I would not say this is a bad product at all.  However, it may help in preventing frizz to some degree but when it comes to humidity, it is not that good---unless you like for your hair to expand.  I also tried the curly buttercreme which I thought it was heavy even when I used a small amount.  I have tried other products for curly hair that are much better.  Would I say the products were expensive, I cannot say that because there are other products that are around the same price, however, the shipping cost was $12.00 for a 8 ounce product----now, that is expensive!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. The entire line is extremely over priced. My scalp broke out behind using this product.I thought I was crazy so I tried the no sniff version. It was equally poor. It took half the day for the mess to dry. My advice use something other than Miss Jessies line. SI purchased the curly pudding, butter creme, and merange. I had to give all that mess away. Yes, I called it mess because it is horrible. Try Karens Body Beautiful hair milk it is awesome(  Cranberry Cocktail). Carols Daughter and my new found favorites Taliah Waajid Protective Mist Bodifier and Kinky curl leavin in conditioner. My hair feels light,soft and manegable.   **********STAY AWAY from Miss Jessies products********************</li>
    <li> It was a gift my sis loved it</li>
    <li> My friend/co-worker gave me a sample of this, and I loved it. I applied some of it to my hair, and my hair came out SO shiny and so soft. I&#x27;ve never tried a curl creme that&#x27;s worked as well as that product. I&#x27;ve tried the Pillow Soft curls, but that doesn&#x27;t compare. Curly Pudding gets an A+.</li>
    <li> A little heavy for my fine hair, so it causes some build-up, but makes my curls real nice.</li>
    <li> I know they say in their description it is an 8 oz jar but use a picture of a 16 oz one which I stupidl bought without catching.  My mistake but very misleading as I buy my daughter these about every 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the cream and leaves my curls soft without the need to use other products. I would recommend this product for your hair.</li>
    <li> Miss Jessie is OK but it is very expensive. There are more products that will give you better results. Before purchasing this product check out mixed roots curl pudding. You pay $14 for the mixed roots product and receive more for your money.     Miss Jessie should consider lowering her prices or provide more product. You can get some of the same results with gel. Believe me, I know. I have been natural for 3 years.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend.  I find that my curls lasted longer with minor fixing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update commentscomments when jar is finished.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly and good hair, and this made my hair hard and stiff. It gave me more curls but I wouldn&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair smells after putting the scented curly pudding on it. That and the fact that it feels like a moisturizer sets it apart for me. But when you get down to the nuts and bolts, it&#x27;s got the same hold as other gels and holding products I&#x27;ve used. It lasts for about 2-3 days in a twist out, I haven&#x27;t used it on a braid out yet. It keeps my hair soft too.</li>
    <li> i have natural curly hair and this is by far the best product i have ever used. wakes up the curls, makes my hair soft. just watch you dont use too much at once, start off ith only a nickle size in the palm of your hand.</li>
    <li> This product has been the answer to all my har problems. I have semi curly wavy hair that by the end of the day is frizzy with no curl or wave. This product had changed everthing, my hair is just as great at the end of the day as it is in th morning after styling. I just rub quarter size amount in the palms of my hands and work through my hair root to ends, towel dried, and air dry.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I rceived my purchase which was delivered ontime, however, this product does not agree with my hair, it made my hair dry and stiff after I use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff was great for my curly hair. I felt like maybe I was using a bit too much of it, but my hair is very thick to begin with.</li>
    <li> I recently cut my locs after 15 years, so being natural is not new for me. I have Afro 3c/4b (curly kinky), and this sat on my head like dandruff. I don&#x27;t typically have dandruff, so knew this was the culprit. Not to mention, whenever I tried a braid out/twist out it left my hair so flat with a TON of frizz. Tried Camille Rose and even raw shea butter alone did a better job than this. This will be going in the trash bin!</li>
    <li> This is really the best darn curly pudding. The best curly pudding on the market. Absolutely love it over everything.  👍👍</li>
    <li> I like the way it extends my curls and keeps my hair looking shiny.  I use about 3 products on my hair and you curly sisters should understand that but this is one of the best by far.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly hair that gets frizzy so I straighten it. I have always wanted to wear my natural curly hair without looking crazy but couldn&#x27;t find the right product. Curly pudding is fantastic- it gives my curls hold without making my hair crunchy or flaky with product.</li>
    <li> I have tried TONS of products and this is the only product i have found that works for me.  I wash my hair (which is very curly) and apply by combing it through with my fingers or a rat tailed comb.  Many reviews are saying it is heavy and greasy, then you are definitely using too much.  It leaves my hair light and bouncy and shiny, but not heavy and greasy at all.  Also, make sure this is the right product for what you want to accomplish.  You can go to Miss Jessie&#x27;s website and see the instructional videos.  You can sit under the dryer to also dry your hair under the dryer or let it air dry.  But you hair should only be damp when you use it, not overly wet.  LOVE THIS product!  It is expensive, but it is actually competively priced with similar products.  The large jar is $48 bucks but you should only use a little bit at a time so it should last a couple of months at least.  That&#x27;s two months without going for a hair appointment, which would be way more than $48.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product. It smells good and it did very well on my friends hair. However, this did not work on my hair. It left some parts of my hair feeling &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; and dry. I followed directions to a T. Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product work! A little goes a long way. However, it is costly for one who has thick hair! I maybe got four uses!</li>
    <li> I saw this at a hair store &amp; thought &amp;#34;Hey, I have curly hair. Let me try expensive, small sample&amp;#34;. And so I bought it &amp; it didn&#x27;t work. It didn&#x27;t stretch out my curls like it said it would &amp; it didn&#x27;t even provide my hair with moisture. What company makes a products towards textured hair without providing moisture?! This one does! The great thing about this product is the texture &amp; fragrance. Other than that I wouldn&#x27;t bother purchasing this product. Just try another one that works like I&#x27;m going to do.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this curly pudding!! It smells wonderful and really helps in achieving my flat twist out look!!</li>
    <li> I love using this for my twist outs! They come out so defined and the smell is wonderful!</li>
