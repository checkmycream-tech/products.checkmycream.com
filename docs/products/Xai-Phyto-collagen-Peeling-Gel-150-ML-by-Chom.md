<li> Two days after receiving a high end spa facial, a single use of the product made my face noticeably brighter and clearer.</li>
<li> Because I haven&#x27;t exfoliated properly in awhile, it did cause my face to break out a little bit this first week, which is expected.  </li>
<li> but I am not sure why the price went up so much.</li>
<li> This product promises that old dead skin will peel off when this product is applied and massaged into the skin.</li>
<li> You know I usually try everything that&#x27;s new because when I go shopping</li>
<li> but when I use this it seems to help with my dry skin.</li>
<li> This product is made to react so that you are fooled into thinking you&#x27;re removing dead skin, when in reality it&#x27;s simply a chemical reaction taking place.</li>
<li> It works instantly and exfoliates the dead skin cells well.  </li>
<li> I bought this brand in the past from my work that worked a lot better than this one from amazon, not sure what went wrong, but the quality doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same for some reason at all</li>
<li> I have sun damage on my chest resulting in a chicken skin feel and afterwards it feels so soft,  much smoother and less noticeable.  </li>
<li> I usually buy several at a time and also give as gifts.</li>
<li> I asked one of my dark skinned friends to try it</li>
<li> It also didn&#x27;t bother my allergies in the least.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Reasonably priced product that can be regularly used on face, neck, chest, hands, elbows, and feet! Inexpensive product so use beyond face is not a cost concern.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not necessary. You know I usually try everything that&#x27;s new because when I go shopping&lt;br /&gt;the sales people don&#x27;t have patience with me or I&#x27;m not getting a good connection with them, I think it&#x27;s my age&lt;br /&gt;or may be I&#x27;m not friendly, and this way I can see the price at home.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;s ok, it works but not necessary for me, but I may look for it again in a year</li>
    <li> This product is the best thing EVER!  It is gentle enough to use every day and leaves your skin feeling so clean and bright, I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it again!</li>
    <li> This product removes calluses from knees, ankles, and elbows and yet is so gentle that it didn&#x27;t irritate my extremely sensitive face at all.  It also didn&#x27;t bother my allergies in the least.  Two days after receiving a high end spa facial, a single use of the product made my face noticeably brighter and clearer.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good product but I am not sure why the price went up so much. I think it will be the last time I purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I love this peeling gel. It works great. I bought another kind Pearl gel and it does not work as well. I recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it really is good.  I use it daily before washing my face and it is a daily staple to my beauty regime.  I usually buy several at a time and also give as gifts.</li>
    <li> I was given this as a gift and I can believe how much and how gently it exfoliates.  I could not believe what came off of my face in the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is noticeably softer and clearer.  Because I haven&#x27;t exfoliated properly in awhile, it did cause my face to break out a little bit this first week, which is expected.  Even if you have it done at a spa that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this price, it&#x27;s a great buy.  I use it before a I shower and then wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering a couple of these soon.</li>
    <li> I bought this brand in the past from my work that worked a lot better than this one from amazon, not sure what went wrong, but the quality doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same for some reason at all</li>
    <li> This product promises that old dead skin will peel off when this product is applied and massaged into the skin. When I initially used the product on my fingers and rubbed them together, immediately white flakes appeared, although the directions say you have to massage the product for a bit. I also used this on my face. The white flakes were also not my skin color...this made me wonder if it was skin coming off or the effect of the chemicals in the product that happens when you introduce heat and friction from rubbing it on your skin. I asked one of my dark skinned friends to try it and she also immediately saw bright white flakes, not dark flakes that matched her skin. This product is made to react so that you are fooled into thinking you&#x27;re removing dead skin, when in reality it&#x27;s simply a chemical reaction taking place. I really would like my money back from this seller!</li>
    <li> I have paid this collagen and I thought this will make my face looks fat but I did not have any change</li>
    <li> It works very good. I like it a lot. the price is low and good.&lt;br /&gt;Korea produce is very good.</li>
    <li> Very good, gentle,  exfoliant for a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I am new to peeling gels. Being a rabid believer in the power of exfoliation, I knew I had to give it a try.  This gel is fantastic and works on your whole body. I read the reviews before buying it and found most are true. This stuff gently exfoliates  removing surface debris which leaves a clearer, smoother and healthier complexion. You can immediately feel the difference afterwards.  I noticed after exfoliation that make up and lotions sank in better.  I have sun damage on my chest resulting in a chicken skin feel and afterwards it feels so soft,  much smoother and less noticeable.  A great solution for those with very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Works really good on my sensitive skin. A very gentle exfoliator.  I use it on my face, neck, elbows, feet.</li>
    <li> Really like this product.  It works instantly and exfoliates the dead skin cells well.  Rub it on, use your hands to work aound, and rinse; instant smooth and silky skin. Would recommend.  Not drying at all.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it once a week to help my skin look smoother. Feels wonderful after I use it. My skin is red and irritated all the time but when I use this it seems to help with my dry skin. Love love love this product.</li>
    <li> Again this product was one of those on Dr Oz show and have not tried long enough to see all the results but it does feel good when I apply it, and being 73 I should not ask for miracle to look as when I was 21.</li>
    <li> I really like this a lot very gentle on my skin but works well enough to use on my bf&#x27;s calloused hands. It also comes in a nice large size. Super happy with this :)</li>
