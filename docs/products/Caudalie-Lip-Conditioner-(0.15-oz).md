<li> you feeling very dry.  </li>
<li> Also, a little thing, they placed their store sticker on the tube which just about covers the entire lid</li>
<li> So be careful if u purchase this item....</li>
<li> Helped my cracked lips when other products didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> Not worth it at all.</li>
<li> It feels good going on, but the effect is awful.  </li>
<li> and I am still slightly bothered by the smell each time.</li>
<li> , i would have to re apply every 10 minutes totally not worth it!</li>

<li> Only downside is that it is expensive.</li>
<li> Only 4 stars because I think it&#x27;s too expensive.  </li>
<li> This works and is less expensive, but I prefer Sugar brand lip products.  </li>
<li> I only selected 1 star because every time I used it, my lips would chap up really bad.</li>
<li> Well, it made my lips (AND the area around my lips) way worse than it was to start with.  </li>

    <li> Great product....moist and luscious.  Only 4 stars because I think it&#x27;s too expensive.  I keep it in my purse and use it constantly.  My other Caudalie favorite is their Divine Oil.  I really like product but wish it were cheaper.</li>
    <li> payed too much for this and it does not moisturize my lips, i would have to re apply every 10 minutes totally not worth it!</li>
    <li> My lips get extremely dry in the winter. I&#x27;ve tried many other lip treatments but they only seemed to make the issue worse. This lip conditioner has kept my lips soft for months</li>

    <li> This is, by far, the best lip balm I have ever used.  I live in Maine where the winter leaves you feeling very dry.  This product does the trick.</li>
    <li> I like it, it smells good too :)</li>
    <li> Best lip anything I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> I found this over a year ago and really like it.  It&#x27;s colorless and flavorless and does the trick.  Very moisturizing.  Of all of the lip balms I have, it is the only one my 5 year wants to use too!  Only downside is that it is expensive.</li>
    <li> Best lip conditioner.</li>
    <li> Very expensive and not any better than the $3 lip balm. Was surprised since all the reviews made it sound like the best thing out there. Also, a little thing, they placed their store sticker on the tube which just about covers the entire lid so now there&#x27;s adhesive all over the container where I &#x27;tried&#x27; to take that sticker off. I encounter stickiness every time I handle the darn thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and really like, light texture, no discernible scent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  You have to keep it in a cool environment though.  Otherwise it melts and you have to reshape it.</li>
    <li> By far the best lip conditioner I&#x27;ve run across. doesn&#x27;t just sit on top the lips~~moisturize as well!</li>
    <li> i love this lip balm its light wight and keep my lips hydrated at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;it smells really nice and its perfect for me since i always search for new lip balms and i have tons of them&lt;br /&gt;its not sticky at all which is a good thing that i always search about in lip balms, will order again. :)</li>
    <li> I use this several times a day, every day. It is allergy free for me!</li>
    <li> This works and is less expensive, but I prefer Sugar brand lip products.  I have this in my purse &amp; put it on throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.  I love it.  Feels  great and  nice.  My lips stay moist for hours.</li>
    <li> Not worth it at all. Just another expensive chap stick. Returned it.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with dry lips for my entire life.  I found a product I liked 15 years ago, but they stopped making it eight years ago.  :(  I finally discovered this last year and it has been a life saver.  It&#x27;s great under lipstick, or on its own.  It tastes great.  And my constantly dry, cracked lips look full and gorgeous.  I put it on once when I get ready in the morning, once after lunch, and once before bed.  That&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite!</li>
    <li> Good stuff but very expensive.  I have found cheaper brands that do just as well.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  I get chapped lips every winter and this year I decided to treat myself to something &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; than chapstick.  I chose this because of all the great reviews.  Well, it made my lips (AND the area around my lips) way worse than it was to start with.  It feels good going on, but the effect is awful.  Very expensive too!</li>
    <li> I religiously keep a lip balm in winter jacket and when I ordered this product I hoped it would become a staple for years to come. The last two lip balms I have used were baby lips and Nivea&#x27;s \\&quot;A kiss of milk and honey\\&quot;, both of which I would buy again before I repurchased this product. This is not to say that the product is horrible, but its not great and the price is somewhere between high-end beauty products and drugstore buys. For me the Nivea product was much more effective, convenient and cheap.    The product also has a smell, which I would assume is the grape seed oil, that I thought would grow on me but I am more than halfway through the tube and I am still slightly bothered by the smell each time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for stocking stuffers one year and now at everyone&#x27;s request, been buying it ever since....wish it were not so pricey...but great product.</li>
    <li> Works better than any lip balm lip balm I have ever used. Dead skin sloughs off if you have any. It&#x27;s great. Wish it tasted more like vanilla than it does.</li>
    <li> Best lip conditioner. Helped my cracked lips when other products didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Has been a great lip balm.Very moisturizing.</li>
