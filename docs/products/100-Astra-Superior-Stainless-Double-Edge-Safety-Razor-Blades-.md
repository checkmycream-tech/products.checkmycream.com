      <li>These are my favorite blade and this was a great price for them.</li>
      <li>I was very happy with the Astra Platinum blades, they were right on par with the Feather Weight blade at 1/3</li>

      <li>They do a good job but the edge could be better honed on them.</li>
      <li>Close enough to top out on the best value and win my purchase.</li>
      <li>Amazing smooth shave!</li>
      <li>I like these razor blades because they give me a very smooth shave.</li>
      <li>89lb very smooth shave, no tug, no burn ...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to try many DE razors.</li>
      <li>Love these blades.  </li>
      <li>Oh well, it does lather better, if it REALLY has the longevity I&#x27;ll be happy with it too.</li>
      <li>I realize that every man&#x27;s face is different, but for me, these are the perfect balance of flexibility and sharpness.</li>
      <li>$0.13 per blade is an astonishing price considering the price of cartridge blades.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a lengthy task with many a nick and scrape along the way.</li>
      <li>price is so good that I just use a fresh blade each shave.</li>
      <li>-they did okay).  </li>
      <li>I wish they were all in a more compact storage medium.</li>
      <li>Love these blades.</li>
      <li>Many of us try lots of different blades to find the edge that best matches our beards.</li>
      <li>I have used over a dozen different brands and these are the best I have tried.</li>
      <li>but I prefer the SS just a bit more.</li>
      <li>Well, however many blades they&#x27;re putting on them now.</li>
      <li>For whatever reason, I find these better than the Astra SP blades.</li>
      <li>nice and cheap.</li>
      <li>I like the Astra brand, but the Platnum blades are better I think.</li>
      <li>but I was probably more prone to cut myself with the Sharps and the Merkurs.</li>
      <li>These astra blades are a great deal, but I found I never got my technique good enough to avoid all cuts.</li>
      <li>Like many others, I purchased a sampler pack before committing to buying 100 blades of one type.</li>
      <li>About 3 years ago I moved to Mach III and thought they were the best I could expect without going to the double edged blade.</li>
      <li>awesome blades nice packaging and very very sharp</li>
      <li>Very smooth and comfortable save.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these in my Above the Tie H1, R1, and M2 razor and get BRILLIANT shaves.  </li>
      <li>Everyone is different - for some, this blade won&#x27;t be ideal.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Astra Superior Stainless for about 4 or 5 years now.  </li>
      <li>They cut well and keep a good edge for a while, the kicker is that they are the absolute cheapest of any blade that I like.</li>
      <li>I bought these on the basis of other people&#x27;s reviews of sample packs where they seemed to pick the Astras as the best out of their packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried most every brand out there and believe this blade is the most balanced: inexpensive, very smooth and comfortable, sharp, great longevity.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews for Astra and they were good, highly recommended  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These are good, not as sharp as the Feathers, but good.</li>
      <li>They are really good for 1-2 uses and then you need a new blade..</li>
      <li>Easily 3-5 smooth and close shave&#x27;s out of each blade.</li>
      <li>Some of the blades were fine.  </li>
      <li>I had first liked Astra SS blades; but after several days of use, I noticed my skin began to rash, something I haven&#x27;t experienced with Astra SP blades.</li>
      <li>If I could afford to use a new blade every-time, perhaps they might be almost as good as the precise safety</li>
      <li>The complaints about glue on these are accurate to an extent.</li>
      <li>by far the best blade out there, not even comparable to the Feather blades, they are ALOT sharper and last many shaves.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems with nicks and they shave is close and smooth.</li>
      <li>razor bump free.</li>
      <li>Couple cost with fantastic shaving</li>
      <li>So much cheaper than buying todays razor blades!!!</li>
      <li>Being able to dispose of a 5 cent blade is exactly why I switched to DE safety shaving in the first place. :)</li>
      <li>(as in running piping hot water over your razor as you shave, post shave balm vs aftershave, and shaving in the shower (where it&#x27;s more humid/steamy)</li>
      <li>Any bumps, acne, whatever just gets sliced off and then I have to clean up blood.  </li>
      <li>I tried several blades with a &#x27;54 Super Speed, and this was by far the best for me.</li>
      <li>so I bought them, not disappointed they are a good blade maybe after I run out of these I&#x27;ll try a different brand something I can compare them to.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and these blades glide on my face nicely without any tugging or scraping.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands and these were the most comfortable.</li>
      <li>Some were true duds.  </li>
      <li>I found the astra stainless blades to give a much better shave than the platinum.</li>
      <li>After trying many different blades, these were the ones I fell in love with.</li>
      <li>I love it when I find something that is not only way cheaper but better to boot.    </li>
      <li>I got this in a sample pack, and I&#x27;m sure glad I did -- this is definitely not the blade for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am a black American male with typical black male facial skin.  I have been shaving for over twenty years and have used many different types of shaving devices.  I have been using  double edge razor blades for only two months but the effect and results these razor blades have had on my facial skin is simply Awesome.  My facial skin used to brake out with typical razor bumps from shaving and ingrown hairs but since I ve started using these razors my skin has totally cleared up.  Before I was shaving with the very expensive Mark 3 and 4 razors but these razor blades are awesome and cheaper in the long run.. Great product I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Blade choice is a very individual thing.  I find these to be great.  They are consistently sharp without being rough.  The double wax paper wrapper is adequate.  The price is right.</li>
    <li> Super smooth gentle shave. Not to aggressive so it is a good choice for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised.  If you have sensitive skin, these blades are not for you.  For the price, they are an excellent buy.  They do also dull rather quickly (after about 3 shaves - and I don&#x27;t have that thick of a beard).  Still, a decent buy.  Russian made decent construction and QA.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other Double Edge Blades besides (Astra) I read the reviews for Astra and they were good, highly recommended  so I bought them, not disappointed they are a good blade maybe after I run out of these I&#x27;ll try a different brand something I can compare them to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of razor blades and these are tied with a few others for being my favorite. They cut well and keep a good edge for a while, the kicker is that they are the absolute cheapest of any blade that I like. Couple cost with fantastic shaving it&#x27;s a no brainer for me.</li>
    <li> My personal favorite razor blade... I&#x27;ve tried many, and this one is the best for me. Try it to see if it works for you!</li>
    <li> I said good bye to 8 blade razors 2 years ago. Is it 8 blades now? Well, however many blades they&#x27;re putting on them now. I used a Straight razor for a few months and then went to the safety razor after I was introduced to the feather weight blades. With the help of our Amazon community I tried the Astra Platinum blades which have a stellar price tag and just as stellar reviews. I was very happy with the Astra Platinum blades, they were right on par with the Feather Weight blade at 1/3 the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am even happier with the stainless blades, and I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO MULTI BLADE RAZORS. I have sensitive skin, I have learned that extremely sharp, single blade, cheap razor blades are the secret to keeping my acne prone skin from breaking out. I learned that it&#x27;s not just a sharp blade but a clean blade that keeps me razor bump free. These Stainless blades are the sharpest, with a capitol S. Multi-blade razors get skin and corrosion build up on them, I can&#x27;t even touch it to my face without breaking out. If I could afford to use a new blade every-time, perhaps they might be almost as good as the precise safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see myself going back to platinums because these stainless Astras are more blade than I can use in a single shave. I find the platinums have superior sharpness. The stainless blade stayed just as sharp after giving it an alcohol bath and using it a second time. After two uses it was retired. I give this blade 5 stars because I have high maintenance skin, and it gives my skin everything it can ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I use these safety razor blades in conjunction with cold pressed hemp-oil as a pre-shave, and lather with a badger brush and foaming soap. I find this to be the best combination for the closest shave.</li>
    <li> I have tried about 12 different types of blades before choosing Astra blades as my favorite brand. It is a well rounded blade in terms of cost, sharpness, and being forgiving.</li>
    <li> Who would have thought that Gillette blue blades could be outdone? No wonder these Astra blades have printed they are made for Gillette. Move over Gillette, your days are numbered with those little plastic toys you are making now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are great value for money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember sneaking my father&#x27;s Gillette swing razor when I was a kid to see what saving would be like at 12 or 13. Oohhh, that hurt, what a bloody mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I had used wet shave double edged Gillette blue blades for 40 years. About 3 years ago I moved to Mach III and thought they were the best I could expect without going to the double edged blade. Where I live Mach III blades you get 5 blades for $12, and they last 2 maybe 3 shaves. I even bought an expensive Braun electric and killed the tungsten blades in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started reading on the web how the wet shaving revolution was taking hold again, for reasons of economy and a better shave. I watched a bunch of Youtubes to see if I had lost my touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra blades had mixed reviews, but I see most were complaints about how unforgivably sharp they are. Well I know blades are a personal choice, but I have a 4 o&#x27;clock shadow by 11 in the morning, and If I don&#x27;t shave the next morning I look like I don&#x27;t have a home to go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Astra blades are better than anything I have used, including the individually wrapped ones signed by King Gillette. Google him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is I only bought 100 pack of them. According to my calculations I have 2.2 years (800 shaves) for under $19 or .02 cents per shave. No comparison.</li>
    <li> These blades are sharp , give a good shave and priced right! Have tried a few other , more expensive blades , and these work well.</li>
    <li> Love these blades.  I have been using the Astra Superior Stainless for about 4 or 5 years now.  Originally I purchased 3 big sample packs with lots of brands and different types from each brand.  The Astra &amp;#34;platinums&amp;#34; tore my skin up, as did many of the other &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; brands (here&#x27;s looking at you Feather) that cost much more.&lt;br /&gt;These were the kindest to my skin while still being sharp enough to cut through my very course and thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot attest to their ability to hold an edge as I toss the blade after a single use (though I have reused them on a couple of occasions where I had run out-they did okay).  Being able to dispose of a 5 cent blade is exactly why I switched to DE safety shaving in the first place. :)</li>
    <li> My husband loves these blades and he isn&#x27;t having to buy multiple blade razors which are so expensive.  His shaves are just as close using this single blade.  There is no reason for multiple blade razors other than to make these companies more money.</li>
    <li> First time trying these. I have used Astra platinum&#x27;s before and these are a little sharper and give less razor burn. Good blade for the money.</li>
    <li> I went through a big variety pack.  Some of the blades were fine.  Some were true duds.  I bought the 100pack of Astra blades at the end of the variety pack.  Having used 6 thusfar, the blades are very sharp and last about a week of shaves for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Individual choices may vary, but I find that the STAINLESS BLADES outperform the PLATINUM every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATHER blades are quite nice, but are a full DOUBLE the price of the Astra.  While 30$ for 100 blades may still be cheap on the cost/shave scale, the Astra blades were a very close second to the Feather, in my testing.  Close enough to top out on the best value and win my purchase.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been shaving with a safety razor for a long time but in the year that I have I&#x27;m tried various blades. The Merkurs that came with the Merkur razor. Sharps, Personas and Schicks. I can use any of them but I was probably more prone to cut myself with the Sharps and the Merkurs. I liked Persona especially since Walmart \\&quot;had\\&quot; them for $1.76/10 but they sold out where I am and have Schicks instead which I tried but they felt rough to me. I went to CVS and Walgreens and they had some sort of store brand blades for... I think it was $5.99 or $6.99 for ten so I said the heck with that.    So I came home and ordered a couple hundred Astras and a couple hundred Sharks from Amazon. I&#x27;ve only tried the Astra so far but... wow... I can really smirk when I walk past the overpriced razors at Walmart now. For 15 cents a blade I get a vastly superior shave. I love it when I find something that is not only way cheaper but better to boot.    I did splurge for a silvertip badger brush though. Oh well, it does lather better, if it REALLY has the longevity I&#x27;ll be happy with it too.</li>
    <li> I have tried many blades in my many years of shaving and these Astra are the best blade for my face.  These blades work well in both my Edwin Jagger and my old Gillette.  I get a close shave every time with almost no razor burn and no nicks.  I can get 6 shaves from each blade, although that last shave does take a bit more work.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and comfortable save. I never have nicked myself with these blades.  No irritation at all.  Highly recommended, especially for a beginner.</li>
    <li> After trying many different blades, these were the ones I fell in love with. I hardly get kicks using them and you get so many blades for such a nice price! It&#x27;s a win-win scenario for me.</li>
    <li> I got this in a sample pack, and I&#x27;m sure glad I did -- this is definitely not the blade for me. I&#x27;m shaving my legs, so I&#x27;m not exactly dealing with coarse hair, but even so this blade dragged and took several passes where I normally just need one. It just plain feels dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I&#x27;m using it in a Parker 29l and I&#x27;ve previously been using Shark blades.</li>
    <li> Very sharp, I have thin hairs so I could get three shaves from each blade. Keep in mind it comes with 100. It has lasted me months and month. I&#x27;m not even a quarter of the way through with the blades. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> speedy delivery great product</li>
    <li> I am opening these packs and using them as quickly as possible but I&#x27;m finding that many of the blades are rusted, which is a bummer.  I should have bought the Astra SP&#x27;s...live and learn!</li>
    <li> I like these with my Edwin Jagger razor and they work well.  They don&#x27;t work that great with my vintage butterfly razor, most likely due to a slight size difference.  I think that&#x27;s probably one of the biggest things you need to pay attention when purchasing razors.  I got another pair of high quality razors but there were slightly smaller than the type that fit in the razor so be careful which brand you buy, they really are not made to the same measurements.</li>
    <li> I like the Astra brand, but the Platnum blades are better I think. Hard to tell, not much between them</li>
    <li> For the price, packaging and performance…. WINNER! Easily 3-5 smooth and close shave&#x27;s out of each blade. These are sharp but very smooth with no tug. On par with Feather&#x27;s, but a fraction of the price, if you ask me.</li>
    <li> awesome blades nice packaging and very very sharp i like to try different blades but i would probably buy these again</li>
    <li> These blades are excellent. They are very sharp and even tough I have a very tough beard, they last 4 to five shaves. I have sensitive skin and these blades glide on my face nicely without any tugging or scraping. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Amazing smooth shave! You can barely feel it slicing through your stubble! Very sharp and comfortable. For this ridiculous price it is a steal! I&#x27;m loading up. These blades shave better than Personnas as good as they are. Perform excellent in my Merkur 34 C and Parker 99R butterfly razors. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> You can do the math yourself and see how much you&#x27;re saving. Its a great deal. These are sharp enough and can last a week or two...maybe 6 or 8 shaves I&#x27;d you do it every day or two. If you wait a while and get longer, thicker beard between shaves they&#x27;re really only sharp enough for the one go.</li>
    <li> I started shaving with a traditional razor a few years ago, and after trying many blades on my sensitive skin, these are the best for me. Very close shave, but the fewest cuts.</li>
    <li> Get Astra way better worth the extra couple dollars. I&#x27;ve tried so many before I think Astra is one of the best for the value to bad it is made by Gillette.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I purchased a sampler pack before committing to buying 100 blades of one type. I found the astra stainless blades to give a much better shave than the platinum. These blades were my second favorite in the 16-pack (with feather being first). I decided to cut my costs in half and buy these, as they give me a great shave every time with little to no irritation.  Update: after finally getting through a 100-pack of blades (which lasts a couple years!) I decided to buy the more expensive feather blades instead. These astra blades are a great deal, but I found I never got my technique good enough to avoid all cuts. With the feather blades, I don&#x27;t seem to end up with any cuts at the end. I have pretty thick beard hairs, and it seems that I need a super sharp blade for a smooth shave. Toward the end of the second use of the astra blades, they would start to dull and not run as smoothly over my face.</li>
    <li> For the money, this is a great blade. I tried a 16 blade sampler, when I got to this blade, I knew it was the one for me. I use an Edwin Jagger 89 lbl with canned foam and shave cream from a tube. I shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> My new favorite blade. I thought that because Feathers were the sharpest, they were the best. But I tried these as part of a sampler pack and they cut just as close as Feathers did for me, without any irritation.</li>
    <li> Sharp, clean shave. I like these and Feather blades.</li>
    <li> Not as described. Astra blades (as shown in the picture) are made in Russia. The brand delivered, &amp;#34;Bluebird&amp;#34;, is not an Astra product and is made in &amp;#34;Europe&amp;#34; (Turkey). Many of us try lots of different blades to find the edge that best matches our beards. It is a lengthy task with many a nick and scrape along the way. When you find the best blade for you, Astra in my case, you stock up and buy, oh, a hundred of them. Imagine my chagrin when I opened the box to find a 15 month supply of a lesser brand of blades. 2 stars because they are indeed double edged razor blades and because there are 100 of them. Those part of the description, and only those parts, are true.</li>
    <li> These blades are not as sharp as Feathers but they are forgiving and allow me to shave my face relatively carelessly but still plenty sharp to get a BBS shave. I like Bluebirds a little better but they probably aren&#x27;t worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Excellent shave. Long lasting keeps the sharpness.</li>
    <li> nice and cheap. i use each like like 2-3 times</li>
    <li> These are my favorite blade and this was a great price for them. I was happy to find these on Amazon</li>
    <li> by far the best blade out there, not even comparable to the Feather blades, they are ALOT sharper and last many shaves. The Feather ones feel like utility knife blades in comparison.</li>
    <li> Love these blades. I realize that every man&#x27;s face is different, but for me, these are the perfect balance of flexibility and sharpness. I even prefer them over the platinum Astras. This is after trying 50+ brands of blades in sampler packs; this is now my regular brand.</li>
    <li> I like these razor blades because they give me a very smooth shave. I have tried many different brands and these were the most comfortable. It probably depends on your face though, so try other blades before you inevitably migrate back to these.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I have ever used for a safety razor. I have used over a dozen different brands and these are the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than buying todays razor blades!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve yet to try many DE razors. Only having tested these, Merker&#x27;s, and Feathers. I bought these on the basis of other people&#x27;s reviews of sample packs where they seemed to pick the Astras as the best out of their packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good, not as sharp as the Feathers, but good. The complaints about glue on these are accurate to an extent. I don&#x27;t feel it effects my shave, but their is glue on the cutting part of the blade sometimes (I just run it under hot water a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these I&#x27;d say I get 3 shaves before I want to switch em out. Once I have more of a standard for comparison I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN PROBLEMS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat (as in running piping hot water over your razor as you shave, post shave balm vs aftershave, and shaving in the shower (where it&#x27;s more humid/steamy) have all improved razor burn problems for me (regardless of the razor used).</li>
    <li> I have been using traditional razors for about 6 months now, and my LEAST favorite blades to this point have been the Astras. They have felt duller than the Derbys I used before or the Feathers I got in a sample-pack. I made the investment in the 100-pack because the price was right, but the performance makes me feel like I got what I paid for. Against the grain, they leave MAJOR razor-burn. They are really good for 1-2 uses and then you need a new blade.. They do not seem to do well at angles on a neck and only work when directly with or against the grain (another sign of dullness). I am going to try a few different blades, but so far Derby seems to be the best moderate-priced blade. I am going to pitch the remaining Astras I have left. I won&#x27;t be using them.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t keep and edge beyond 1 shave and barely that...very disappointed and have like 100 of them left.</li>
    <li> As an old man I don&#x27;t know how many times I have shaved my face and head. These blades are excellent and give an Army Officers&#x27; shave. You won&#x27;t go wrong purchasing these.............</li>
    <li> Good blades  I use them with the Edwin jagger 89lb very smooth shave, no tug, no burn ... Quality blades at a good price.</li>
    <li> I had first liked Astra SS blades; but after several days of use, I noticed my skin began to rash, something I haven&#x27;t experienced with Astra SP blades. I gave my brother several tucks and he prefers the SS to the SP. As with all things wet-shaving related, this is a matter of personal preference. If you prefer a sharper blade, I&#x27;d recommend the SS over the SP; but if you have sensitive skin, you may find SPs to deliver a more comfortable and equally as close shave.</li>
    <li> These blades are remarkably sharp. I have never gotten any tugging with these. The superior platinums are great as well. The only other blade above par that I have tried is the feather.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and these blades have provided a smooth easy shave without any burn.</li>
    <li> These give a great shave. I&#x27;ve had no problems with nicks and they shave is close and smooth. I get 4 good shaves from a blade then change it out.</li>
    <li> I shave with these daily.  There is plenty of debate among wetshavers regarding the virtues of one blade over another.  I find that these blades shave well for me and they cost less than most of the blades on the market.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is this weird oily substance coating the blades after you unwrap them from the wax paper. Not the easiest to wash off and I find it makes hair stick to it easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most every brand out there and believe this blade is the most balanced: inexpensive, very smooth and comfortable, sharp, great longevity. I sent my brother a pack of 100 and he has made these his go to blades as well. Very similar to the comfort of Bolzano but shaper like a Feather. Perhaps Polsilver are a notch above BUT at 2.5-4 times the price, these Russian blades are a no brainer, even compared to another Russian favorite of mine, Gillette 7oClock Blacks. I&#x27;ve been using these in my Above the Tie H1, R1, and M2 razor and get BRILLIANT shaves.  Don&#x27;t underestimate the great price. Ditch those stupid department store, 5 blade cartridge, razor gimmicks. Shave like your grandfather did. If you looking for a great DE razor, I suggest the Merkur 39C here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1: I&#x27;m so impressed that I have now stocked up on 700 Astra Superior Stainless (SS) blades. For whatever reason, I find these better than the Astra SP blades. In my opinion, they last as long as the SP but shave smoother for my face. I still like to dabble with all the other brands, but so far these are the only ones that I&#x27;m currently stocking up on. I use these in my Weber, Ikon OSS, Ikon Open Comb, Ikon Standard closed comb, Gillette Super Speed, Edwin Jagger de89l, and Merkur 34C Heavy Duty, Merkur 37C slant, Feather Popular, Gillette Tech. Try these blades!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2: Still by far my overall favorite blade, smooth, comfortable, and very sharp. I really like the Astra SS in my more efficient razors like the Weber and Ikon Open Comb. The Ikon OSS is so gentle, though, that you may want to use a Feather instead. However, nothing else has produced for me a smoother shave than this blade with my more moderately aggressive razors. My other shave friends agree with me as well. Buy these before you might not be able to find them in the future. Astra SP might be cheaper but I prefer the SS just a bit more.</li>
    <li> I purchased a sampler, and this is the first one that stood out. It&#x27;s smooth, sharp, and comfortable. I purchased a 100 pack, which I&#x27;m using to refine my technique so I can correctly evaluate the rest of the sampler pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, the Platinum version of this brand to me was like shaving with broken glass. Go figure. Everyone is different - for some, this blade won&#x27;t be ideal. For me, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Bear in mind everyone&#x27;s a unique snowflake and double-edge shaving is all about experimenting and finding the right blades and whatnot for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used Feather, Derby and Astra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather is too sharp for my liking.  Any bumps, acne, whatever just gets sliced off and then I have to clean up blood.  The blades quickly dull and irritates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby is too dull, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra, for me, is perfect.  I can get through a shave with one blade and minimal irritation--my skin is ridiculously sensitive and the hairs on my neck grow in all different directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use them when shaving my head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is so good that I just use a fresh blade each shave.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Great blades a little aggressive though. They do a good job but the edge could be better honed on them.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
    <li> I have several Astra blades in the Platinum finish and they work great. These are stainless and last longer and stay sharper. I wish they would be carried by Amazon instead of 3rd party sellers..like Amazon for customer service and shipping.</li>
    <li> Smooth shave and long lasting for me. I tried several blades with a &#x27;54 Super Speed, and this was by far the best for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had great luck with this purchase. These blades offer quite a good shave. I&#x27;m using them with the razor handle linked below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000NHSAVQ Merkur \\&quot;1904\\&quot; Classic Safety Razor - Open-#41- Made in Germany]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1.) The price. $0.13 per blade is an astonishing price considering the price of cartridge blades.&lt;br /&gt;2.) The quantity. I&#x27;m not concerned about stretching the use of each blade like I was with the cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;3.) The sharpness. I use each blade for five to seven shaves. I have moderate stiffness and thickness of my beard, but these hold up well if you dry them properly after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) The container. The blades are stored in tiny boxes, five per box, and then 20 boxes are affixed to a display card that you&#x27;d see in a 1950s barbershop or pharmacy. I wish they were all in a more compact storage medium. I&#x27;ve taken to jamming the boxes into a 500 business card shipping box to save space on my countertop.&lt;br /&gt;2) The glue that affixes the wax paper to the blade in the box can sometimes stick to the blade. Sometimes that glue can make the blade not seat properly in the blade handle. To avoid this I just use the old blade to scrape the glue off if it&#x27;s stuck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only shaved twice with these blades, but so far i&#x27;m getting as results as good as my feathers.  I usually only get 3 shaves out of the feathers, so we&#x27;ll see if I can get a 3rd from the Astras.  But for less than half the price ($0.13/blade vs. $0.30 for feathers), its a nice find.  All I ask is: why is Gilette making these in Russia?</li>
    <li> This blade is tops for my face and beard.  Very happy !</li>
