      <li>I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Impressed yet</li>
      <li>Great product and great service!</li>
      <li>Works great for me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
      <li>if you follow all the directions and watch the video a couple times before first use, to make sure you feel confidant in use it works beautifully.</li>
      <li>Clippers or razor work much better.</li>
      <li>Using it about a month, will stay with it couple months more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a long process, but the end result is very good!</li>
      <li>Works better on fine hair than the course stubble</li>
      <li>I have used the product for almost 2 weeks - about 6 sessions on arms, 2 on legs and face, blade still working fine.    </li>
      <li>Followed accurately the directions on the supplied DVD.</li>
      <li>make sure it is fully charged before you use it the first time.</li>
      <li>well worth it.</li>
      <li>My wife really was getting use to it and was very pleased with the result until it just stopped working, Amazon was great in getting the information to the selling dealer and made the proses of sending it back simple, now we wait and see how long it will take to get a new one back.</li>
      <li>The system does not work easily and will not do well on facial hair.</li>
      <li>keeping the light constant.</li>
      <li>It has worked very well on my face.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well</li>
      <li>It really does not that well:</li>
      <li>it does not work very well--</li>
      <li>Scared my wife with the hot wire, wouldn&#x27;t even go near it.  </li>
      <li>New kit,  factory sealed</li>
      <li>Wish I had ordered direct from No</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>I should have paid more attention to the negative comments and not ordered it!</li>
      <li>Does not do anything that is advertised as far as removing hair, stubbles left.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in the hair removal after several tries</li>

    <li> I have not experienced any pain, burns, rashes, or problems with the wires. I have used the product for almost 2 weeks - about 6 sessions on arms, 2 on legs and face, blade still working fine.    this pinky from amazon as well as  No No devices bought at from try dot com and hsn website they performed similarly.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use so that it stays on my face and when I do hear to beep of a contact, I don&#x27;t see any hair removed.  Wish I had ordered direct from No No so I could return it.</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t do what they claim. Then they try to tell you that you have to use it several times before it takes away any hair. I followed all the instructions and tried it in different places  but never saw any hair removed. Bad news!</li>
    <li> The system does not work easily and will not do well on facial hair.</li>
    <li> if you follow all the directions and watch the video a couple times before first use, to make sure you feel confidant in use it works beautifully. i have been using it daily for two weeks and already the hair is starting to get finer and in some places like my arm, not coming back like with shaving or depilatory cream well worth it. make sure it is fully charged before you use it the first time. no pain the first few passes initially with feel awkward but it didn&#x27;t hurt at all</li>
    <li> Great product and great service!</li>
    <li> Save your money. Does not work well.</li>
    <li> it does not work very well--I don&#x27;t see much difference in the hair removal after several tries</li>
    <li> The process to remove the hair is long.</li>
    <li> My wife really was getting use to it and was very pleased with the result until it just stopped working, Amazon was great in getting the information to the selling dealer and made the proses of sending it back simple, now we wait and see how long it will take to get a new one back.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use...keeping the light constant. Works better on fine hair than the course stubble I need it for.</li>
    <li> Does not work a waste of time and money</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I got so frustrated!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I threw it in the garage</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it burns the hair off.  I have too much to get rid of and the smell is sickening.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t  work anything like described....</li>
    <li> It DOESN&#x27;T perform as advertised! One of the head attachmenrts was defective, (wire was too long and bent) plus even after fully charging the &amp;#34;NoNo,&amp;#34; it wouldn&#x27;t remove facial hair, nor chest hair. I should have paid more attention to the negative comments and not ordered it!</li>
    <li> Does not do anything that is advertised as far as removing hair, stubbles left. Bad smell of burning hair. Even if worked in removing hair as advertised....would take over an hour to just do your legs. Very disappointed with product. Got my money returned.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well</li>
    <li> This devise has been a bit difficult to get right. Had a hard time taking anything off my legs, but maybe I don&#x27;t have it set high enough. It has worked very well on my face. I have extremely sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t hurt my face.</li>
    <li> used as recommended, this does work! It&#x27;s just a long process, but the end result is very good!</li>
    <li> Did not work.. I wish it did.  Will attempt to return... let you know if it works later...</li>
    <li> Only had it a couple of weeks. Not. Impressed yet</li>
    <li> Wow. It&#x27;s pretty good!</li>
    <li> No the small tool it  doesn&#x27;t work what can I do?</li>
    <li> having to practice to use it</li>
    <li> burns hair, burns skin</li>
    <li> My wife finds it totally ineffective and we would like to return it!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just doing it wrong or what, but I can&#x27;t get the thing to work.</li>
    <li> Everything came as advertised. New kit,  factory sealed</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work, and the power panel on the front was different from the TV advertising.  Unfortunately, I accidentally threw away my return label, so am trying to find out how to return it to them.</li>
    <li> Works great for me. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> It really does not that well:</li>
    <li> It burned my skin bad!</li>
    <li> Removes hair using a red hot wire that is hard to keep at the proper angle without burning yourself.  Clippers or razor work much better.</li>
    <li> Product was defective when received from the shipper.</li>
    <li> sure is difficult to use</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to the letter. Took a while to get the proper speed down. Don&#x27;t notice it removing any hair but does seem to be slowing growth. Nothing like the commercial. Using it about a month, will stay with it couple months more. If don&#x27;t see bigger difference will trash it. Was only $65, friend payed almost $300 almost a year ago.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Need info on how to return.</li>
    <li> No No Not for me. Couldn&#x27;t get it to do what was advertised. Followed accurately the directions on the supplied DVD. Just didn&#x27;t do what the ads said it would.  Scared my wife with the hot wire, wouldn&#x27;t even go near it.  Walt</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on me!!</li>
    <li> Damages skin. Does not work as promised.</li>
