      <li>I really love this eye pencil!!</li>
      <li>goes on easy and looks great!</li>
      <li>for me a kohl liner glides very smooth and you get a lot of product aout of it..</li>
      <li>This pencil is not a shortcut to looking more awake</li>
      <li>Stays on and I am able to apply it inside my lash line with no irritation.</li>
      <li>Love love love.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Most Rimmel products make me happy, but their eyeliners are absolutely my favorites.</li>
      <li>Very cool.</li>
      <li>Love how it goes on smooth with no effort</li>
      <li>It glides on easily and creamy</li>
      <li>It glides on so smoothly, and does not irritate my eyes like a lot of them have.</li>
      <li>Creamy, smooth an long-lasting, they go on the color advertised and stand out.</li>
      <li>Really great for making the eye appear larger.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m makeup free for a while.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and really brightens my eyes!</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for, it arrived quickly and it was cheaper than the stuff I buy at the store!</li>
      <li>Very becoming for a more rested wide eyed look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as good as expected..</li>
      <li>but thought this liners glides good, you don&#x27;t get that much product, so you don&#x27;t get the white color you want...</li>
      <li>The packaging was ok / arrived on time but the eyeliner was not soft, kind of dry and crumbly, broke quickly as soon as I try using it no matter how gently i pressed, and broke every time I sharpened it.</li>
      <li>Love this white eyeliner.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I hoped for.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll most likely buy it again when the need arises.</li>
      <li>Use it on the rim under your eye, and for a touch more brightening power, use a dark navy blue liner on your top lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I have very sensative skin, and it has never irritated it.</li>
      <li>When I tried using it along my lower lash line, I had to constantly draw over and over until more of a white pigment showed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had that happen twice before with liquid eyeliners, but rarely with anything</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone with smaller eyes, or just for anyone who likes to have fun and play things up a bit for the upper lid!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes when it comes to allergies.</li>
      <li>Just a touch of Rimmel Soft Kohn Kajal Eye Pencil 071</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive eyes or even mildly sensitive, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product AT ALL.</li>
      <li>The white is very visible without having to go over the lid repeatedly.</li>
      <li>that said, I&#x27;ve used this white liner twice and both times it made one or both of my eyes swell up and tear for 2 DAYS straight.</li>
      <li>Pure White makes your eyes look bigger and brighter.</li>
      <li>I really like putting a couple swipes of this white eyeliner on the inner part of my bottom eyelid.</li>
      <li>At first, the white is intense but after a few blinks it fades a bit and makes my eyes appear larger.</li>
      <li>Right now the corner of my eye is raw and red (on day two of this).</li>

    <li> Instant refreshment for your tired eyes.  Very becoming for a more rested wide eyed look.</li>
    <li> This is a great beauty trick for a great price. Just a touch of Rimmel Soft Kohn Kajal Eye Pencil 071 Pure White makes your eyes look bigger and brighter. Use it on the rim under your eye, and for a touch more brightening power, use a dark navy blue liner on your top lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be surprised at the dramatic effect.</li>
    <li> This liner is awesome! I had never used a white liner before but the effect on my lower lash line was impressive. It goes on easily and really brightens my eyes!</li>
    <li> I really love this eye pencil!! It glides on so smoothly, and does not irritate my eyes like a lot of them have. It widens my pocahontas shaped eyes and makes them look brighter. I would highly recommend this to anyone with smaller eyes, or just for anyone who likes to have fun and play things up a bit for the upper lid!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as expected.. for me a kohl liner glides very smooth and you get a lot of product aout of it.. but thought this liners glides good, you don&#x27;t get that much product, so you don&#x27;t get the white color you want...</li>
    <li> I thought using this pencil on the inner rims of my lower eyelids would be the only thing I needed to do to look less tired but i was wrong. I still need to use whitening eye drops and under eye concealer as well. Oh heck! you may as well curl your lashes and sweep on a coat or two of mascara! This pencil is not a shortcut to looking more awake it&#x27;s just another step.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with the experience I&#x27;ve had with this product. I&#x27;ll most likely buy it again when the need arises.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is great for lining the inside of your lids. It does not pull which makes the application a breeze. I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I really like putting a couple swipes of this white eyeliner on the inner part of my bottom eyelid. At first, the white is intense but after a few blinks it fades a bit and makes my eyes appear larger. It only takes a second to apply. Very cool.</li>
    <li> Pencil is a great product. It glides on easily and creamy which is what I wanted. I use it as an accent to my make-up. The white is very visible without having to go over the lid repeatedly. It stay on all day until I remove it. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this. Most Rimmel products make me happy, but their eyeliners are absolutely my favorites. Creamy, smooth an long-lasting, they go on the color advertised and stand out. Will definitely buy again. Made my ulzzang look perfect.</li>

    <li> Great eye pencil.  goes on easy and looks great!</li>
    <li> Love this white eyeliner. It is exactly what I hoped for. Stays on and I am able to apply it inside my lash line with no irritation. Really great for making the eye appear larger.</li>
    <li> Love how it goes on smooth with no effort what so ever. I wish I could find it in stores but for some reason nobody carries it. Great pencil!</li>
    <li> Use as a liner in the of the eye, to make eyes look bigger!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive eyes when it comes to allergies. However, very little makeup actually sends me off into a watery mess. I&#x27;ve only had that happen twice before with liquid eyeliners, but rarely with anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I&#x27;ve used this white liner twice and both times it made one or both of my eyes swell up and tear for 2 DAYS straight. Right now the corner of my eye is raw and red (on day two of this). So I&#x27;m makeup free for a while. If you have sensitive eyes or even mildly sensitive, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product AT ALL. Unless you&#x27;re going for the zombie eye look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did use it, it doesn&#x27;t last at all. Especially when using it on the waterline of my eyes. It just clumped up at my tear duct. When I tried using it along my lower lash line, I had to constantly draw over and over until more of a white pigment showed. It just wouldn&#x27;t draw on! You can imagine how frustrating that is. Not to mention it felt like I was taking off my skin. I ended up just using white eyeshadow instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product. It doesn&#x27;t last and it&#x27;s making me currently suffer. :(</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the other reviews! This is my all time favourite eye liner! Will be buying this product for the rest of my life. It&#x27;s not too hard, and not too liquidy. Get compliments on it all the time. I have very sensative skin, and it has never irritated it. Love love love.</li>
