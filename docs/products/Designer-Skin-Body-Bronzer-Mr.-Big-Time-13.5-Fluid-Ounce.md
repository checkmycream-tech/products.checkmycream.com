<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have not used this much since purchase.  I plan to give it the full test while I am on vaction soon.  It is a nice application, not oily, not messy or streaking.</li>
    <li> Good lotion, got pretty dark doing lvl 3 beds. Highly recommend it to anyone with tattoos as well, mine did not fade a bit.</li>
    <li> off the bat, this smells exactly like CK one. To me, it smells very masculine. I haven&#x27;t tanned with it because I think I&#x27;m going to return it based on smell alone. However, IMO this wouldn&#x27;t give you that gross DHA after tan smell like most lotions. The consistency is really nice too. However, I don&#x27;t want to smell like a guy so I&#x27;m returning it. Would be a great tanning lotion for men though.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty decent. Works decent. Leaves skin really greasy. I prefer hd Mann but mr. Big is much cheaper. Would probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product &amp; FAST shipping!</li>
    <li> this stuff is good all around and 50$ at the tan places</li>
    <li> Love this product even if it&#x27;s for a man love that it protects tats and has soap sent similar to escapade will buy again !!</li>
    <li> Great lotion for men! Smells great plus a little bronzer without the fake look added! My boyfriend loves his it!</li>
    <li> Has a nice clean smell, not flowery , and works well.</li>
    <li> Good tanning bed lotion at a great price</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend. He thinks it works great and I love the smell!</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful on this and does a great job at getting my hubby tan.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product! It smells very good too...my wife loves it.  Now if only I could find a cologne that smells this good.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Works even better! Great product, highly recommend Mr. Big Time</li>
    <li> greasy, not a strong bronzer</li>
    <li> Was kinda weary about fake lotion, but was legit!</li>
    <li> Great Product w/Fast Delivery!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great.  It is smooth and smells fantastic, even after a visit to the tanning bed.  It has a masculine scent and leaves your skin feeling refreshed.  This is not a knock-off lotion and is much less expensive here.</li>
    <li> great product. No complaints. i would order this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Its a little bit more oily than I like, but it is a great bronzer.  I am not sure how long it should last but so far it is working great!!</li>
    <li> Excellent mens tanning lotion. Best I have found yet.</li>
    <li> Very smooth on skin , smell good after tanning ,shipped fast love it</li>
    <li> About one of my favorites at this point.  It moisturizes well and gives a good color.  my wife likes the smell too.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell of this lotion but did leave my skin feeling oily and greasy. I had to stop using it because it made the acne on my shoulders much worse. Other than that with the aid of the Matrix tanning bed did give me a great overall tan, especially since I have fair skin and don&#x27;t tan well.</li>
    <li> The best smelling lotion I have used. Very masculine smell to it, I love it.  The product also seems to do a good job keeping my tan going.</li>
    <li> First time my husband ever used tanning lotion and he really likes it.  It smells great, was a good price and was shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> Smells so good! Tans my husband really well. He loves that it has a cologne smell for a man.</li>
    <li> There are 5 parabens listed on the bottle even though this product is advertised as paraben free.  I don&#x27;t personally know how well the product works but I do know the smell is amazing.  Makes me wish it was paraben free.</li>
    <li> it smells good but is very oily and im not getting any darker. waste of money imo. only gave it 3 stars cause it smells good.</li>
    <li> Perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used this lotion prior to buying it. I wanted something that&lt;br /&gt;-smelt great&lt;br /&gt;-was not greasy&lt;br /&gt;-and made me darker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended it since she works in a tanning salon. Glad it doesn&#x27;t have the tingle factor and the bronzer works great.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to get a tan with quicker results. Overall it was quality lotion and worked. I personally loved the smell and so did my lady. Cant beat the price on amazon compared to your local tanning salon for $60(+).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the salon workers know you get from amazon they get sad since they didn&#x27;t make commission. So they try saying the product is tampered, old, and not the same as theirs. I compared mine to what they had it looked, smelt, and felt the same as mine. the only difference is I saved $30.</li>
    <li> This is labeled for men, but the girls at the tanning salon recommended it to me and I like it better than the ones for women. Smells good, not too masculine, works good, doesn&#x27;t have a greasy, heavy feel. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Used this before at tan co.. Was a first time tanner, and it seemed to work great.  Not too sure about other lotions, but I can leave this one and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything. Works just fine, and is way cheaper buying it off amazon than it is in a store.. I&#x27;m no expert on what kind of lotion to get, but if ur a guy like me and just want a good lotion that smells great for a good price.. heres your sign</li>
    <li> Ive used a lot of indoor tanning lotions and this one has got to be the best one thus far. It gives an awesome color , doesnt even turn you orange with the bronzers. My last lotion did. It gives color super fast, has a cologne smell, and later in the day I dont have that tanning bed burn smell on my skin. My only gripe about it is that it leaves an oily layer on my skin that I feel like I need to take a shower . other then that its great</li>
    <li> I LOVE this smell. It&#x27;s not all floral and cheap perfume smell. It&#x27;s very relaxing. Not to mention it&#x27;s not all oily when you put it on! Will buy more soon!</li>
    <li> I thought this product was an excellent choice. I bought two and I find that this is just as good as the ones I bought at the tanning salon. Would recommend this to my best friend. Results are great.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, clean and fresh-- not fruity and overpowering!  Not just for guys..  Leaves skin soft and not greasy.  Dries reasonably quick.  I achieved a nice even tan using it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!!! The hubby loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times. This is the first time I ordered it from here. Upon receiving the package, i could tell the contents had been tampered with. This lotion is supposed to be a dark shade or brown/tan. The lotion in the container was almost white in color. Would not recommend to anyone. This was a big let down.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really getting me dark for vegas!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this!!! He is very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Arrived timely. Item as described.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Designed for men but excellent for use by females who appreciate men&#x27;s cologne. Good moisture</li>
    <li> WARNING: Product shipped was expired!! The date on the bottom of the bottle (once you remove the black plastic cover at the bottom) was 4/2014. I just ordered the lotion a couple of days ago.&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be for anyone who ordered this product through amazon to check the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep the lotion because it looked and smelled fine. Also I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of shipping back a $20 item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Related to the quality of the lotion, I used it today and it seems to be working fine. It also smells pretty good. Overall it seems like it&#x27;s going to be a good tanning lotion to get some color!</li>
    <li> Love the price! It would be double the price at salon! Best tanning lotion for a dark tan. Smells really nice too.</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and never used the lotions. They were either to sticky or oily and always smelled like perfume. I&#x27;m a dude so I&#x27;m not trying to smell like a female after tanning so I really never gave much consideration for using lotions. Finally we got this on stock so I wanted to try it. It smells like I&#x27;m putting on cologne along with getting a great tan, and it dries up super quick so I barely feel like I have lotion on. I&#x27;d recommend it, especially since it goes for around 60 bucks at a salon (at least at mine.)</li>
    <li> As described, well packed and arrived on timeWould recommend to anybody, very satisfied with the service. Will use the service again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve used for real! Nice color and smell!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Always been a fan of Designer skin products. this one gives me a nice color and smells great. It&#x27;s not at all &amp;#34;manly smelling&amp;#34; to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He used it and liked it OK, the smell isn&#x27;t very nice but nothing a shower after tanning won&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> This lotion smells so GREAT! Smells like my fiance is wearing cologne when he has this on. He loves this lotion and has never found a lotion he has ever liked. Perfect amount of bronze, great texture, all around a A++!</li>
    <li> It smells great.  It doesn&#x27;t leave that burning smell after a solarium session on your skin but a lovely smell. Its great to apply and not greasy.  I definitely would recommend it to anyone men and women.  I love it and they wont be disappointed .</li>
    <li> Not my first purchase and wioll order again when needed</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion of all time!</li>
    <li> There are tons of lotions out there and this one is great. Its not my favorite, but the price was more than reasonable. This one is nice and silky smooth so you can tell it is a silicone based product.</li>
    <li> The product smells great for a guy and the price is 1/3 of what they charge at my local Tanning Store.</li>
    <li> Im not sure why, but this lotion just did not do ANYTHING.... My husband used it, and it didn&#x27;t do much for him, I thought maybe it was because he doesn&#x27;t tan that often, so I tried it, and sure enough, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me either. What a disappointment, for the amount paid.</li>
    <li> After using the product for a week I find it only gives you 1 shade darker but doesn&#x27;t give that great tan look.  A light tan would be great in the winter.</li>
    <li> Im asking because I dont feel like its doing anything. That said Ive never bought the real deal to start with so I dunno. I do tan 4 days a week and have bought a few other brands on Amazon with great success. I thought I would try something new. WELL Im going to go back to the other ones because I dont feel like this is doing anything. Its also really thin. You can see its dark brown but theres a clearness to it. Hmm I dunno about this one.</li>
    <li> I like the scent and it works into the skin very well.  Why only 4-stars?  I&#x27;m a guy....I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion for my husband who complains about smells all of the time. But he loved the way this smelt before and after the tanning bed. It also works great I could tell a big difference in just one tanning session.</li>
    <li> Mr Big is great. Love the color and super moisturizer of this lotion but the best part is the fragrance. It is not a flowery girly scent but smells great on women. Also even 8 hours after tanning there was no bronzer carbon smell. Just a wonderful scent. And the color is fast and golden brown. LOVE this lotion!!!!! The Tattoo non fade is just icing on the cake!!! Great lotion!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Smells manly and got me golden skin</li>
    <li> Great smell and does not leave that burnt tanning odor after you tan. Great product so far not one complaint.</li>
    <li> We are big fans of Designer Skin and my husband always tries their men&#x27;s lines.  This is a good lotion and he smells like he has put on cologne.</li>
    <li> Masculine scent. Very similar to a good cologne. Nice to not smell like flowers after tanning. 7x bronzer is just the right amount.</li>
    <li> I love it soo much!!! and my boyfriend too!!! This is way beyond what I&#x27;ve expected. it&#x27;s light, it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s slightly itching but it&#x27;s normal</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described.  Smells good and works very well.  Gives me a nice dark tan that I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Doesn&#x27;t leak out of the bottle in heat like other products do.</li>
    <li> it smells like man when I put it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this first at the tan salon, paying three times more.  This item was genuine and authentic, which the salon does not want you to believe.  They prefer to sell you their product at a higher price; claiming amazon products are fake.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is great for men; because it smells clean and neutral.  It kind of reminds me of soap actually.  Men require more moisturizer and this does the job with no slimy mess. It is also great for tattoos.</li>
    <li> Works great and this is the 1st lotion I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t leave you stinky..smells refreshing for hours afterwards &amp; no smelling like burnt skin when you get out:)</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion. I don&#x27;t really see how it is a mans scent. Very unisex. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is my first time tanning so I am no expert. The tan I have now is a nice color. Not too dark and not too light. I also like that if I tan early in the day, the lotion doesn&#x27;t wear off until you take a shower. It has a very pleasant scent as well.</li>
    <li> As someone else mentioned, mine too was received with an expiration date on bottom of 04/2014. Still a good price. Hopefully it&#x27;ll still work since it&#x27;s over a year old.</li>
    <li> A tanning lotion for men.  The scent is like ck one but less floral.  Goes on easily and gives a nice tan.  No heavy bronzers, so it will only get you so dark.  Its nice for a random trip to the tanning salon on the way home since it doesnt dry out your skin and the scent is a compliment getter.</li>
