      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s that easy.</li>

      <li>pure 100% acetone.</li>
      <li>It works and I like having a large size</li>
      <li>Large bottle</li>
      <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
      <li>This really helps remove the layers with out me having to scrape my nails.</li>
      <li>Thanks for wasting my $30 by changing the item listed here.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Arrived fast and as described</li>
      <li>This really doesn&#x27;t remove acetone, so just ignore the whole &amp;#34;Pure Acetone Remover&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>You can get this stuff cheaper at your local hardware store more then likely.</li>
      <li>Look at the bottom of your acetone bottle, under the Recycling logo you&#x27;ll see &amp;#34;HDPE&amp;#34; some other plastic acetone safe containers are marked with &amp;#34;PP&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend this for the normal finger nail polisher......</li>
      <li>It is also added to less hazardous aerosol products (such as Gas dusters) to discourage inhalant abuse of the volatile vapors.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s used in products to discourage people from accidentally (or sometimes intentionally) ingesting something that could be harmful.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells like acetone to me, and should be fine for my purpose - soaking Aztek airbrush nozzles and clenaup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was less than $10 and prime eligible.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s Acetone, pure and simple.</li>

      <li>I would definitely recommend this for anyone who restores shoes and wants to get into repainting.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I soaked three times the suggested amount of time and it still took a lot of scraping to remove old polish.</li>
      <li>It is also added to many kinds of harmful liquids including solvents (such as nail polish remover), paints, varnishes, toiletries and other personal care items, special nail polish for preventing nail biting, and various other household products.</li>
      <li>but most labs can order supplies like this from their regular chemical providers -- they don&#x27;t usually resort to Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Bottle I received has the blue lettering just as the picture (also posted): \\&quot;FoxPro, Professional Collection, 100% ACETONE, 100% ACETONA, 32 fl.</li>

<li> so it&#x27;s not gentle!  </li>

<li> That&#x27;s pretty scary kid...</li>
<li> Some people think acetone is bad for your nails, but if it works quickly, you aren&#x27;t exposing your nails to it for long.  </li>
<li> It contains denatonium benzoate, costs more expensive, and is completely useless to me.  </li>
<li> Nothing removes artificial nails, glue, polish..like pure acetone.</li>
<li> Still not sure?  </li>
<li> According to Wikipedia &amp;#34;Denatonium benzoate is used to denature ethanol so that it is not treated as an alcoholic beverage with respect to taxation and sales restrictions.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the right amount of the stuff and the tall bottle fits in a storage area on my boat easily.</li>
    <li> This is not 100% Acetone as stated on the front of the bottle.  This also contains denatonium benzoate.  Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 32 oz. Acetone and never received my order its  been about 2 months. Shipment arrival estimate was 6/8/2010 and its 6/25/2010 today, i ordered it 5/15/2010.</li>
    <li> Ordered 3 to give to my daughters recieved 2</li>
    <li> The strongest I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> -- My review:  I bought this for removing gel polish and occasionally cleaning things off of glass or some other nonporous surface.  It does everything I expect it to, at a great big 32 Oz value!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- My rant:  I have noticed a lot of reviews complaining about the additive &amp;#34;Denatonium Benzoate (Bitrex)&amp;#34;.  All of the hype got me curious enough to look a few things up.  Denatonium Benzoate (Bitrex) is a bitterant.  According to Wikipedia &amp;#34;Denatonium benzoate is used to denature ethanol so that it is not treated as an alcoholic beverage with respect to taxation and sales restrictions. ... Denatonium is used in rubbing alcohol as an inactive ingredient. It is also added to many kinds of harmful liquids including solvents (such as nail polish remover), paints, varnishes, toiletries and other personal care items, special nail polish for preventing nail biting, and various other household products. It is also added to less hazardous aerosol products (such as Gas dusters) to discourage inhalant abuse of the volatile vapors.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s used in products to discourage people from accidentally (or sometimes intentionally) ingesting something that could be harmful.  It&#x27;s the same stuff used in many products to discourage thumb sucking, and it&#x27;s a harmless (inactive) ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That got me wondering who might want or need acetone without Bitrex?  Perhaps people doing lab experiments? Maybe...but most labs can order supplies like this from their regular chemical providers -- they don&#x27;t usually resort to Amazon!  The only relevant stuff I could find was related to drug use...in short: If you are looking have a &amp;#34;psychedelic experience&amp;#34; this isn&#x27;t for you, it contains a bitterant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- My Advice:  Look at the bottom of your acetone bottle, under the Recycling logo you&#x27;ll see &amp;#34;HDPE&amp;#34; some other plastic acetone safe containers are marked with &amp;#34;PP&amp;#34;.  If you&#x27;re worried about destroying a plastic bowl (and hopefully it&#x27;s not too late!) check for the Polypropylene (PP) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) first.  Still not sure?

    <li> It&#x27;s acetone...did what I needed it to do.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a lab to verify that it&#x27;s 100% but it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> This product is no longer the item pictured. The new product is not pure acetone as the description reads.  It contains denatonium benzoate, costs more expensive, and is completely useless to me.  Thanks for wasting my $30 by changing the item listed here.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and very quick service!</li>
    <li> is what is says it is.</li>
    <li> I often use stickers and faux stones on my nails. Lots of glitter too. This really helps remove the layers with out me having to scrape my nails.</li>
    <li> Acetone is not just for fingernail polish removal any more.  It helps remove &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; marker, which is great to have around, it cleans better than alcohol for ink stain removal from carpeting, and similar cleaning jobs.  Glad to have this on hand!</li>
    <li> Product is as described.</li>
    <li> 100% acetone is a great all purpose cleaner. I mostly use it for doing gel nail manicures to cure the polish you must use acetone to take away the tacky gel + set the manicure. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It works and I like having a large size so I don&#x27;t need to keep shopping for a replacement.  It takes off the nail polish with ease.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find 100% pure acetone in your regular supermarkets. Acetone has many uses that (unfortunately) many people don&#x27;t know about. Most people associate acetone with nail polish remover. It is also a great cleansing agent for glass and can be used to infuse chemicals into dry herbs (leafs). This is a good amount of acetone for the price!</li>
    <li> Great shipping. Its a bottle of acetone, not much one can say about that,lol</li>
    <li> This acetone remover &#x27;t very strong to take off my shellac polish.  I soaked three times the suggested amount of time and it still took a lot of scraping to remove old polish.</li>
    <li> It has a chemical added to it.  It is not pure acetone.  false advertising..........</li>
    <li> This really doesn&#x27;t remove acetone, so just ignore the whole &amp;#34;Pure Acetone Remover&amp;#34;. But it does seem to contain 32 fluid ounces of acetone, and that&#x27;s just what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Great price, shipped fast. Works great for Gel polish.</li>
    <li> Woo-wee!  This stuff will knock yer sox off!  Removes acetone really good.  Other acetone just kind of stinks and evaporates, but this stuff, well, if it&#x27;s acetone yer after, this is the  place.</li>
    <li> i bought this to remove my no-chip myself.  I followed the same steps as done in the salon (even using thier advice), but this product just didnt seem to be effective.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this for the normal finger nail polisher......it should be used only in beauty shops because it is very strong and \\&quot;melted\\&quot; the plastic I had it in which I used to \\&quot;soak\\&quot; my shellaced nails off.  Then afterwards there is the disposal which I still don&#x27;t know how to properly do that.</li>
    <li> Great Purchase, Thank You!</li>
    <li> Fantastic for removing store-bought faux nails and a must for glitter and metallic polishes. This stuff is the real deal. It fears nothing-not super glue, not faux nails-just soak and remove the nails. Generous bottle ensures there is plenty for soaking dishes or multiple users. It does tend to be drying and will leave your fingers ashy/white looking. Just wash that off, do your nails and lotion. It&#x27;s that easy. Great price. I always have some on hand. I also refill my &amp;#34;scrubber jar&amp;#34; with it to wash off polish quickly, when I am sporting natural nails.</li>
    <li> This works as good as any finger nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used. A fantastic buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Is what it is...pure 100% acetone.</li>
    <li> Bottle I received has the blue lettering just as the picture (also posted): \\&quot;FoxPro, Professional Collection, 100% ACETONE, 100% ACETONA, 32 fl. oz. 960ml e\\&quot; and on the back, \\&quot;INGREDIENTS: Acetone\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like acetone to me, and should be fine for my purpose - soaking Aztek airbrush nozzles and clenaup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was less than $10 and prime eligible.</li>
    <li> Works well for my purposes, is pure and relatively cheap, would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd or 4th order of this and I love it. I&#x27;m always amazed how it never spills, the packaging is great.</li>
    <li> Worked well. You can get this stuff cheaper at your local hardware store more then likely.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Acetone, pure and simple. Use it for what you use acetone for. Came in well packaged without any spillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought mine from: Amazon.com LLC</li>
    <li> delivered as described</li>
    <li> Large bottle and it sure does the job.</li>
    <li> Great product, perfect as advertised.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and as described</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s pretty scary kid... &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; This stuff is extremely flammable, it should not be lit on fire, You are asking to be burned if you do. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Even the Fumes are Highly Toxic - use extreme care when handling this product!!!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However acetone has Many other great uses when used properly. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a great product at a great price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;JD</li>
    <li> Large bottle, works great.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good product at a good price. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Nothing removes artificial nails, glue, polish..like pure acetone. Even though it&#x27;s supposedly bad for your nails. Try not to use it more than once every couple weeks because it will discolor your nails with ugly brown streaks if you overuse.</li>
    <li> Product works well but I wish the cap was childproof just in case.  I keep it out of reach of my daughter but it would make me feel better knowing she wouldn&#x27;t be able to get into it if she did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s acetone, what&#x27;s there to say? :-)  It was a good size bottle for a decent price.</li>
    <li> works great on shellac or gel nail polish</li>
    <li> I only use this stuff to remove my nail polish.  Some people think acetone is bad for your nails, but if it works quickly, you aren&#x27;t exposing your nails to it for long.  If you use that non-acetone junk, you&#x27;re exposing your nails for a longer period of time to the chemicals because it doesn&#x27;t work!  Use a good nail oil afterwards and everything is perfect!!!  And don&#x27;t even THINK of trying anything else but this to get glitter polish off!!!</li>
    <li> I was concerned that it would not really be 100% acetone. It was, no additives.  The box it came in was too large with not enough packing material.  It rattled around in it.  However, when opened I discovered that it was sealed in an extra bag and all was well.  I have no complaints.  I can&#x27;t bring myself to give 5 stars for basic industrial solvent.  I will buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Gets the paint off with no problems, great product. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who restores shoes and wants to get into repainting.</li>
    <li> great product, great seller</li>
    <li> A very good organic solvent a cleanser.  It works great on my nail polish and does an excellent job at cleaning up other messes.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, good price, as described!</li>
