<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This adds the best lemon flavor to baked goods. Really glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> Very concentrated and smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve used for scenting a room down to homemade lotions with coconut oil. I mix with Eucalyptus and Lavender. Now Products have always come through for me.</li>
    <li> Why pay more for YL oils when Now products are just as good for half as much money and twice as much product.</li>
    <li> The smell is good but really hard to use. It come in a bottle so it is really difficult to pour &amp; cannot use small amount.</li>
    <li> Lemon EO is my favorite for cleaning and NOW is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Smells great in the bottle but once out of it, it quickly loses scent. Save money, just cut up fresh lemons and set them around, scent last longer than this EO does.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this product is great! It is a clear, clean fragrance and I really like it, but it doesn&#x27;t have as much of an oil consistency as i was hoping for.  When used on the Orris Root product I bought and sealed for 2 months, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be strong enough to do the project I am working on.  I may have the wrong Orris Root and I may need to soak the Orris Root longer,  There could be several factors in my dislike for this Lemon essential oil product.  I&#x27;m thinking I need to just look for a stronger oil.  Lemon was my choice for medicinal factors and because I&#x27;m in Florida.  What I&#x27;m thinking is this particular brand does not have enough oil consistency to provide long term fragrance.</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Multi Level companies products yet without all the overhead cost of paying independent sales reps. Will buy over and over again!</li>
    <li> Love the scent and it is cheaper than perfume with a more accurate scent for a casual summer wear xxxxx.</li>
    <li> Nice size bottle and nice product. Bought it to use in my salve I make for cuts and etc..can&#x27;t go wrong with the price either.</li>
    <li> The guy at whole foods said &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t think they make them in anything more than 2 oz bottles&amp;#34; when asked about this brand of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly he was wrong... Better smells while cleaning with less chemicals around the house... Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix this in bleach water and shake like crazy... Instant bathroom and kitchen cleaner.</li>
    <li> great quality oil for diffuser, blending and cleaners</li>
    <li> It smells clean and fresh! Really a great purchase. I recommend this to friends. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This oil is SO fragrant, perfect for many recipes and for making air fresheners for plug in devices and as an additive to potpourri.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say.  Excited to finally start using essential oils, especially when I&#x27;m able to make homemade cleaners for the home that smell great and are safe for my children!  This smells so wonderful!</li>
    <li> I truly use these oils for meditating and deodorizing and the concentration of this product definitely out did itself. Wonderful product with multiple uses and the size has continued to last throughout all my endeavours.</li>
    <li> The Lemon Oil was received timely with no issue.  The only issue I have with the oil is I wanted to use it for making cookies with a Lemon favor and I can not determine if this is food grade or not?  I am not planning to use it until I can find out.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the fast delivery, got it today. Smell good, tastes good, I am having hard time to get it out without dripping on the side, that&#x27;s why didn&#x27;t get 5 stars. I found the droppers at nature food store at 99 cents and works great.  great price and great volume, highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/1/2013  update&lt;br /&gt;I transfer lemon oil to a 5 mil bottle and carry everywhere. I even use it as hand sanitizer, there are countless time that I use it to remove tough stains, I live in Arizona, the hot sun melts everything here, my 6 years old got the melted gum all over her legs, even got on her cloth at the Costco parking lot, I got the wipes out, put few drops on the wipes and on her legs, started to wipe as much as I can, it didn&#x27;t take long to get it out of her leg and even her legging ! It saved great deal of time, love it!  I often put few drops of lemon in my bath, hair, in cupcake frosting, house cleaning, make up remover..etc. I am using it everyday, surprise to see how long this bottle last. Great deal highly recommend. therefore I am changing it from 4 stars to 5 now.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a stronger lemon smell to this oil but it just seemed to have a watered down smell. Lemon is one of my favorite scents so I was kinda dissapointed. But nothing against the seller...shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It smells great and is a great price! I am very happy with this purchase and will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> This smells amazing! And even better in the shower!  I added it to my bath scrubs! Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lemon scent after receiving the orange scent and this is AMAZING!!! I only have to add 3-4 drops in my homemade cleaner and it fills the air with the scent of lemons!!! I MORE THAN LOVE IT!!! I am also going to use it n my oil defuser! I am stocking up on this scent and the orange scent too which is equally amazing and I HIGHLY recommend this company and its products!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I will sell again because have had time, came in additional, all was great  Will ask again get when I need more.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderfull. Can not wait to try it</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this essential oil! It smells wonderful! Worked just perfect for my homemade soaps and lotions.</li>
    <li> let me explain that  - I love their orange smell. Even the paper mint is ok, but the lemon smell is...simply not there. It is not strong enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert in lemon oil so I&#x27;ll speak about the container first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to dispense from this container!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the design for the container is only &#x27;good&#x27; for containing the lemon oil.&lt;br /&gt;Trying to pour from the container any amount will invariably lead to lemon oil on the container and on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;When pouring 1tbls of product I believe I got 1/2 tbsn of product on my hands and the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing my hands 3 times with detergent didn&#x27;t fully remove the lemon oil.  (1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you paid money and you mustn&#x27;t waste consider fitting a couples of &#x27;ideas&#x27; to the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dropper. No .. it may not fit so..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plastic dropper. You&#x27;d use this after you open the bottle,&lt;br /&gt;use the dropper, then close the bottle. More work but no hand&lt;br /&gt;washing, no or little waste, and no oils on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oil isn&#x27;t something that goes bad easily.&lt;br /&gt;Store in the refrigerator or even the freezer for longest&lt;br /&gt;term storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save money this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a cup of filtered water (you don&#x27;t want chlorine in your water do you?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of drops of lemon oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some sugar to taste.&lt;br /&gt;Citric acid (about 1/8 teaspoon. More or less) to taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drink it.  and enjoy your citrus drink for about 1 cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add ice cubes.&lt;br /&gt;Add a long slice of cucumber or celery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can make a $2.00 drink for 2 cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Citrus oils can cause skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;  Can cause skin irritation and sensitizing in some&lt;br /&gt;  individuals.&lt;br /&gt;  It is a photo-toxic oil.&lt;br /&gt;  It should not be used (even in low dilution) before being&lt;br /&gt;  exposed to the sun.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it actually does work on sticky tags and the smell is very nice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about fragrance and essential oils since we make our own soaps and lotions. Have had good luck so far with the Pure brand in terms of both freshness and authenticity.  I&#x27;d love to see the company beginning carrying some of the folded oils such as 10X Sweet Orange and 5X Tangerine and Lemon, as these are both more concentrated and much less photosensitizing for skin use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A combination of lemon and lavender tossed with buckwheat hulls turned out positively dreamy in a special pillow project. A couple drops of this food grade lemon is also wonderful in homemade lemoncello and helps freshen our washing machine as well.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t purchase this brand again. No offence to the seller.</li>
    <li> great product and smell!</li>
    <li> The best lemon oil I&#x27;ve ever bought, very real lemon scent.  I used it all over the house, but especially in the fridge, around the gaskets etc.  Very clean, delicious scent for my food areas.</li>
    <li> Compre este aceite para usuarlo en mi casa de alquiler. La gente que se ha hospedado con nuestra casa, siempre nos dicen que la casa huele a un aroma fresco y limpio. Usualmente lo usamos en la cortinas de cada habitacion y tambien lo mezclamos con baking soda para limpiar el refrigerador y las alfombras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excelente producto se lo recominedo a cualquier persona que desea sentir al aroma de sus ambientes fresco.</li>
    <li> Been using this brand for years in my diffusers, great deal and top quality.</li>
    <li> I use this in soda stream carbonated water and I love the flavor.  &amp;#34;Now Foods&amp;#34; claims some of  it&#x27;s oils are edible.  I would really only trust that with the citrus ones which work well with the soda stream.</li>
    <li> Very good item!  Can be diluted with any plain oil, such as almond, apricot, canola, ...to impart a pure, naturally fresh scent to your skin. If you like the lemon scent, this oil is great to have.  Be sure to dilute -it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
    <li> Great to remove smell your fridge and freezer for months, to clean or for body detox.</li>
    <li> An excellent product at a fair price delivered right on time. I&#x27;ll certainly use this seller again!</li>
    <li> Smells great.  I used this in homemade all purpose cleaner.  great product.</li>
    <li> I use a drop of two of this in my floor solution before mopping. Leaves the house smelling fresh and lemony instead of a fake chemical lemon smell. Just be careful not to use too much or it can leave an oily residue</li>
    <li> This oil smells great! And was a great price. I most recently used this oil in my homemade laundry soap. Wonderful! The product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I love this essential oil. I&#x27;ve used it in food, and I&#x27;ve already boiled water with a couple drops to freshen the apartment.</li>
    <li> Mix it up in everything from my own homemade floor cleaner to body wash. Smell is great.</li>
    <li> Great.  Could not be more satisfied.  Use in kitchen for a myriad of cleaning &amp; disinfecting jobs.</li>
    <li> Lemon is one of my favorite scents. This is the very scent I was looking for because I wanted to try making perfume. Then I found out that the recommended denatured alcohol costs at least as much as the perfume I usually buy. I was trying to be more frugal! I never made the perfume, but still, I love this lemon scent. It makes me happy. It&#x27;s very lemony!</li>
    <li> Works great in soap.  Nice smell!</li>
    <li> We bought this to use in our air cleaner that uses water. The smell is lemony fresh and very natural. It&#x27;s super nice and smells like fresh lemons. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  This lemon oil is amazing.  The smell is uplifting so it relaxes me and makes me feel happy.  I think this is food grade lemon oil so you can use it in lemonade and for cooking, but I have only used it in my hair (with coconut oil as a carrier).  I just got into aromatherapy to relax myself because I didn&#x27;t want to take meds.  I bought an amber vial with a dropper cap and dumped this into it.  It makes it easier for using since only a drop or two is needed for the effect.  I think this 4 ounce bottle should last me a while.  What I also love is that it is bottled in a glass bottle versus a plastic bottle.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I prefer glass over plastic containers because of the chemicals in plastic.  I will continue to buy this product!!</li>
    <li> This product does work and spell nice if you like lemon. I&#x27;ve had to use it for wart removal with my children and when the freezing did not work and other methods were not working I found a link on lemon oil though i give it a try. it took a few weeks but it did work with plantar 3 kids no problem. good product will buy again. when i run out but i dont think that will be for a while.</li>
    <li> These should be called Wow Foods EO! The price and quality are what keep me coming back. Love these oils. Great for so many household uses.</li>
    <li> Great stuff to use for cleaning.</li>
    <li> The four oz bottles are mostly for dispensing into smaller bottles via pipette.  Use a smaller bottle, keep it when empty, and refill using the less expensive four oz bottle...or purchase an inexpensive dropper bottle.  I don&#x27;t think there are drip dispensers in the four oz size..just a special seal in the lid to prevent leakage.  At least, none of mine have ever had a drip dispenser.  I use my smaller one oz bottles for dispensing drops for general use, and the larger bottles for mixing special blends of my own in dropper bottles that I purchased separately.</li>
    <li> I was trying to make an aftershave, using this and witch hazel (worked well with the orange extract).  It didn&#x27;t work as well with this.  Nothing wrong with the product - something wrong with my process.</li>
    <li> I bought orange, lemon and tea tree oil as a bug repellent and for home cleaning.  I clean around the doors and windows with the orange and lemon oil and then pour a little orange and lemon oil on a cotton ball and leave them in the corner to hopefully repel bugs.  I also clean the kitchen with tea tree because it disinfects. Amazon has great prices on the four oz bottle, just a little more than I usually get the one oz bottle for at my local store.  The only downside is the 4 oz bottle does not have a dropper, it just slowly drips out.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this Lemon Oil many times in the past through Amazons&#x27; Subscribe &amp; Save.  It has now been taken off the Subscribe &amp; Save which is disappointing.  This oil is fantastic.  Sounds odd, but I put this in bleach to tone down the scent.  I hate the smell of bleach.  Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Really like these essential oils, and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;My current favorite is Peppermint/Eucalyptus/Lemon for a wake-up call. Just a couple drops in steam or a diffuser and away we go!</li>
    <li> The product itself is great but I was disappointed that the dropper cap is broken.  I have a smaller bottle that I hadn&#x27;t thrown away so I used a funnel to pour some of the oil into it...problem solved.</li>
    <li> I just got the product and used it in my burner.  It smells so fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned about how well it would work with my oil burner, but I didn&#x27;t need to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying 2 more bottles.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Strong scent but not overwhelming like peppermint is.&lt;br /&gt;A great pick me up for diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in my shampoo scent lingers but not overbearing.</li>
    <li> It smells lovely and will do for now, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Perhaps it was just a poorer batch of oil, I can&#x27;t be sure, but I find myself having to use more of it than I should. I will stick with other brands for my oil needs. It did arrive quickly and in good shape.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and intact</li>
    <li> Good size, good price and seems to be good quality. I use this in my candle powered essence atomizer/dispenser. It smells like lemon. I also use it in my Bonami floor mopper - the one with the refillable bottle of cleanser. I like to think my floors are clean and they do smell nice. White sock feet don&#x27;t come up too dirty.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, arrived fast. wrapped up nice and tight. Smells WONDERFUL!!! Smells like just plain ol&#x27; lemons. I use it for everything! In cleaning solutions, laundry, and to dust with. Excellent quality! Will buy more soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and still learning. I&#x27;ve been using NOW products and love the fragrance and quality. It&#x27;s great that they don&#x27;t use chemicals to extract. Love the lemon.</li>
    <li> Super quality, great price</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this oil.</li>
    <li> This does not have the potent lemon smell I expected. It is more like leaves from a lemon bush. For most items NOW foods is great, but maybe not with essential oils. I also tried their peppermint oil, and it had a dull sent as well.</li>
    <li> OK, this little bottle of lemon oil (well not that little, compared to the little 1 oz bottles that essential oils usually come in this bottle is huge) is amazing. I use it for everything around the house.  I spray it as air freshener, I spay to disinfect and deodorize as I clean, in the dishwasher, in the dish soap, in the bathrooms, trash cans,  I even use it in my laundry! It is very long lasting, I had it for a couple of months and a couple of drops do the job. Another thing I noticed is that the smell makes me feel very happy.  I do not know much about aromatherapy but I definitely notice the change in my mood when I smell the lemon oil.  I feel happy happy happy! This is the only scent I use in the house as synthetic fragrances give me migraines, but this has not trigger any. I love this product and would definitely recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> I use this when washing my cloth diapers (if you know what I&#x27;m talking about - that first rinse cycle smells SO bad, the lemon completely masks it) and sometimes diffuse it when the aroma in our house needs a little boost. ;) I hadn&#x27;t quite realized how much 4fl oz is - this has lasted me quite some time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t have an inner cap - so you&#x27;ll have to find your own or use a dropper. Would not recommend free-pouring!</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful. I totally trust the NOW brand and I buy many of their oils. The prices are reasonable and I mainly use the lemon oil for adding to homemade cleaning products and homemade body scrubs.  I googled the uses for lemon oil and the possibilities are endless.  I use a dropper to get the oil out as the built in dropper is hard to get out of the cap and in another oil by this brand, I use the built in dropper, but it is slow and I feel I have more control with my own dropper.  4 oz might seem small, but you really only need a few drops for most uses, so this bottle will last me a long time which I like.</li>
    <li> Used this to make sugar scrub as Christmas gifts. It worked as needed and the price is great.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much but it did not come with the dropper to measure out the product.  I had read several other reviews that mentioned the dropper did not arrive in other shipments.  I was hoping I would get lucky and get a dropper but I did not.  I use the lemon oil to keep spiders out to the house.  So far it has worked great.</li>
    <li> Arrived as scheduled, great oil. I only wish they had included a dropper cap. I had to order some one ounce dropper bottles &amp; transfer to the smaller bottle. But still, I am happy with the product. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Really fresh smell with this lemon oil. I use it to make hand moisturizer with carrier oils and put it in Miracle II Moisturizer. I also diffuse it in a tealight candle oil diffuser.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil for cleaning and making my homemade laundry detergent!  Great price for a large bottle!</li>
    <li> Love using in my diffuser and steam mop. Lemon is naturally anti microbial</li>
    <li> My favorite oil! This has a very fresh scent! Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> I mix this oil with the orange and peppermint oils to use as a hot oil treatment for my natural african american hair. Smells great and is really great on my scalp. My hair is so healthy!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great price for the amount, and I really love lemon essential oil. However, I do wish it would have come with a dropper.</li>
    <li> Nice scent. I use it with epsom salt and vitamin e oil for body scrubs that I make.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what is in this oil.  I tried mixing it with some stuff that I have used other lemon oils for and it just doesn&#x27;t mix.  It floats on top.  The worse part is, I was using a turkey injector to distribute the oil.  After it sat there for about 20 minutes in the injector while I was doing other things it had a chemical reaction with the rubber inside the injector.  I noticed when I ejected it that it had black in it.  I took apart my injector thinking that maybe it had a little trash in it but the rubber was disintegrating.  It literally melted!  I just don&#x27;t know what to think of this.  I can see if maybe it was left overnight but for 20 minutes, if even that long!</li>
    <li> very nice. i use it to scent my homemade cleaners. strong and fresh smelling</li>
    <li> Smells great.  I love to put a little down the garbage disposal and a couple drops in the under sink trash container.</li>
    <li> It is quite a large bottle. It does not come with a pump or dropper or anything so I can only pour it out and transfer to another more convenient bottle. I am using this with coconut oil. It leaves skin good smell and very smooth.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love an orange smell in their homemade household cleaners? We use this to scent our homemade countertop cleaner.</li>
    <li> Smells great, has a ton of great uses, arrived quickly, and great price for 4 ounces.</li>
    <li> This is the best oil on the market and worth the money! We used it as Air-Freshener and spot remover. The usage of this product is endless....</li>
    <li> Great product- It smells.</li>
    <li> The dropper/dripper top is unattached to the bottle, and completely inoperable with plastic covering the hole. This has been the case on all four bottles ordered recently from NOW.</li>
    <li> The quality of this essential oil is good. It smells great.</li>
    <li> I do love this oil but this bigger size does not have dropper style insert.</li>
    <li> I have loved all the Now oils, great value great scent! I use these in our homemade cleaning products, buying more this weekend. love that I can get prime shipping</li>
    <li> Using this to make my e-liquid. I am using 2.5ml of lemon oil per 50ml batch running 0.625mg/ml of nicotine. Great taste, just make sure to steep for a while to let the flavor mix.</li>
    <li> I add this to coconut oil for furniture also good for butcher block counters and wood cutting boards. I soak a cotton ball and add to a room, closet or drawer for scent. I also mix this in with sesame oil for a natural moisturizer. I love the smell of this.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and good price.</li>
    <li> It smells so good when you open the bottle.  Be careful...a little dab will do ya!  I put a couple of drops in my coconut oil/baking soda facial cleanser.  Adds a little antibacterial boost to keep acne away.</li>
    <li> For over-glorified lemon extract the price is a little high. The fresh lemon scent that I was expecting is achieved after using large copious amounts of the expensive oil.</li>
    <li> my container came in today and it came in empty. yes empty. and worst of all there is a policy on amazon that you cannot return items considered &amp;#34;household hazardous waste&amp;#34;. an essential oil used for cooking. so in now out 15 bucks and no way to get my money back or get the 4 oz of essential oil i paid for! what an expensive bottle. it didn&#x27;t even have a smell of lemon in the bottle or a crack or busted seal of any kind. just a never filled bottle of oil someone didnt take notice of. had the seal on it and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what a disappointing day. ive thought differently about getting all these &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; deals on amazon....</li>
    <li> I do like this scent but using it to burn for home along with orange,do wish they made a home use for burning scent,</li>
    <li> Combines with other essential oils perfectly. Alone, it is just as good in soap making.</li>
    <li> I add a drop or 2 to a 32oz bottle of water for flavor so this bottle will last me a LONG time. Only downfall is that there is no dropper so the oil just flows freely from the wide mouth of the bottle.</li>
    <li> great EO for the price</li>
    <li> I just love the smell of lemon I used this to make some sugar scrub it had my hands smelling good and feeling soft.</li>
    <li> I always buy NOW essential oils when possible and have not been disappointed yet with the quality.</li>
    <li> As usual for the NOW brand of oils I am not disappointed. I started taking a trio of lemon, peppermint, and lavender to help my ever growing battle of sinus problems (living in Alabama can cause that) and this lemon is much more economical than DoTerra or Young living and still a very good quality. And now I can put it in my homemade cleaning products/air freshener. YAY lemon :)</li>
    <li> I am a frugal housewife, therefore I choose to make my own cleaning supplies... and this stuff smells amazing in everything that I use it with!</li>
    <li> Smells great and does what it should!</li>
    <li> I used this product in my homemade products. It smells so very clean and nice, like freshly-squeezed lemons. Everybody loves my soaps because of it!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this to rub on his joints.  He believes it works and I think it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Mix with baking soda to clean bath and kitchen sinks! I like natural over chemicals so this oil is perfect and a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I use this as a de-greaser in my homemade cleaning sprays. It works very well and smells good. You do have to give the bottle a shake before spraying because the oil separates from the water and rises to the top.</li>
    <li> Love essential oil of lemon from the couple of drops in my water to my new aromatic furniture polish.  There are so many uses for this oil.</li>
    <li> Great item for a great price.  And it came SO fast!!</li>
    <li> This is amazing for cleaning in the bathroom. Smells amazing. Can use alone or with other green cleaners. Toilet tub and sink.</li>
    <li> Loved it my house smells like fresh squeezed lemons</li>
    <li> I love this lemon oil. I use it for cleaning and laundry. Makes my clothes white. Better than the over priced stuff.</li>
    <li> Effective and great for the price. Totally worth buying versus wasting your money on Young Living.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Plant Therapy essential oils and always pleased with the quality and purity, but for the amount I use I needed to find a more reasonably priced product.  The Now essential oils are nice and aromatic, but they just don&#x27;t seem to last as long or be quite as strong as others I have used.  For example, I add a couple drops to a load of laundry and can usually smell whatever oil I added after the clothes are dry, but with these I find myself having to add alot more to get the same result.  They are not a bad product, definatly a good value, but not the most potent on the market.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCTS LEMON &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; I USE THE STUFFIN OUT OF THIS</li>
    <li> I use this oil for all kinds of things around the house.  From purifying the air to using it as an all-purpose cleaner.  Very pungent.  high quality.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Lasts forever, and excellent price!</li>
    <li> This is a lot of lemon oil and it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the Now brand of essential oils. They are reasonably priced and seem to do the trick. We are using these for natural home remedies. We do not ingest them, but combine them with carrier oils and add them to humidifiers.</li>
    <li> Still learning how to use this. It&#x27;s very strong - but has a nice lemony smell. Always glad of anything that repels spiders.</li>
    <li> I used this product to make my own Verbena hand and body lotion.  The scent is okay but has a very artificial smell - in fact - every time I use the lotion people tell me I smell like lemon pudding. Not sure if that is good or bad...</li>
    <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
    <li> I usually buy my oils from a wholesaler from whom I&#x27;ve gotten very fresh reasonably priced essential oils, but I was in a hurry and as a prime member I get my orders in two days so I tried to research all the lemon oil manufacturers on Amazon which was a pain.  So many claim to be things that they can&#x27;t possibly be, like &amp;#34;therapeutic grade&amp;#34; which doesn&#x27;t exist, or FDA approved when the FDA doesn&#x27;t regulate essential oils yet if ever.  Some even claimed to be 100% pure, THEN would go on in confusing &amp;#34;double speak&amp;#34; to admit that the oils had been diluted!  I was disgusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t even entirely trust a company that claims to offer a pure &amp;#34;organic product, tho it does tend to cut a good number of hacks from the herd, you still can&#x27;t be sure without a lot of digging whether or not you are getting an uncut product that has been responsibly overseen at every step of its production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve purchased NOW oils before from our health food store, but the more I learned about EOs, the more leery I was of buying oils that had passed thru many hands before I ultimately received them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Still, I visited their website and read about their processes from source to shipment and decided to stay with them because they DO test each batch of oils using gas chromatography, and honestly I forget the name of the second test to which they submit their oils, but they are the two important tests that should be done on each batch of any oil.  But since there IS no regulating body yet for essential oils, I decided to stay with this company fulfilled by Amazon knowing that lemon is a popular oil and likely moves thru too fast to sit around getting hot and dusty and breaking down!  Especially at this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased to say that this oil made it to me smelling more like freshly grated lemon peel than the lemon I received later from my usual supplier!  It&#x27;s heavenly blended with rose geranium EO ( The Enchanted Wilderness) during theday for a bright freshly floral aroma.  Nothing like taking a break in a room that smells like a rose garden!  I haven&#x27;t used this unblended yet except to test and it&#x27;s an oil I&#x27;m looking forward to using in cleaning products of course, and find myself defusing it in more and more combinations!  As much as I run my diffuser having this very reasonably priced sunny, fresh oil to brighten the house is a very nice &amp;#34;indulgence&amp;#34;! :-D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d repurchase thru this avenue again and am looking forward to giving NOW foods oils a second look...From Amazon anyway!</li>
    <li> Such a great deal for so much lemon oil!  I use lemon oil for many things in my home including my drinking water and in a spray bottle for cleaning.  I go through it fast and so happy this is such a good deal. I don&#x27;t like to buy chemicals or products that test on animals.</li>
    <li> These are the best oils!  I have had many different oils from Now brand and have never been anything but happy with them.  I use them in all kinds of ways and never worry as they are made to the highest standards.  If you look on their website, you can read for yourself how the oils are produced.  I am putting this same review on the other oil I just purchased.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiancee...we decided instead of buying the razor replacement packs, we would just refill it with alcohol and some kind of fresh smelling oil. It was great; he loves the smell and it lubricates the razor blades well</li>
    <li> Nice potent smell only drawback is there is no dropper included which I knew from other reviews, but it would be nice if it was included.</li>
    <li> This is a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, but it does not have a dropper top.  You will need to put it in something else because it just pours out.</li>
    <li> use it with my cleaning products, always get compliments on the fresh smell</li>
    <li> I add it to my water to add some flavor and the coupes drops last all day in the bottle, even when I refill my bottle multiple times. Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. So clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Just like all of the other 4 oz EOs I have bought, the plastic contraption comes off so I had to buy a dropper for the EO Bottle</li>
    <li> love it, but have since stopped using it in my burners because I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s bad for cats.  BUMMER!  Makes the whole house smell amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the best price by far! And NOW oils are great! I&#x27;ve started drinking lemon water for all of the many health benefits and an important part is the oil from the rind, just using lemon juice won&#x27;t be as good. This answers the problem! Yum! Plus it&#x27;s easier on your teeth :)</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, I&#x27;m typically allergic to many flowers and I guess SpringTime in General -- but I love the weather and pretty.  Citrus smells don&#x27;t bother me so I tend to use it for a fresh smelling house.  I poured 2 TBLS into the bottom of a vase and have gorgeous decorative flowers that I move from room to room.  It&#x27;s been a month and the smell is still going.</li>
    <li> Good product. Very concentrate. We use with water for lemon water in the mornings when we don&#x27;t have lemons.</li>
    <li> Use half water half lemon oil shake and spray inside or outside your house for especially ants and spiders too. Smells great, goes away when dries. Highly recommend! Good brand.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the lemon oil, the scent seemed quite strong. But after adding it to an unscented coconut carrier oil the lemon scent was hardly noticible. It disappeared almost immediately when I used the blend on my skin. I was hoping for a light citrus scent but got nothing even after adding a whole lot of additional lemon oil. As other customers have stated, the dropper that comes with it, tucked up inside the cap, doesn&#x27;t fit the bottle. I had to order pipettes. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the oil. It is very lemmony. I put a couple drop into a spray bottle and use it to spray the whole house.</li>
    <li> Good amt  for cost. Smells so good.</li>
    <li> I thought I was purchasing something else but this came and I will have to find uses for it.  Very strong lemon scent but it smells good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found this brand to be very high quality. I&#x27;ve bought numerous bottles with so many uses.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few of NOW essential oils and I have not been disappointed. The fragrance is lovely and always brightens and freshens a room.</li>
    <li> Six drops in my Vornado humidifier &amp; spraying all corners of my house to repel spiders worked out well. It&#x27;s so aromatic I can now comfortably do the &amp;#34;silence of the lambs buffalo bill dance scene&amp;#34; without jumping on the ceiling from a creepy crawler.</li>
    <li> love lemon oil, relaxing</li>
    <li> makes THE best cleaners</li>
    <li> Taste like furniture polish.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this scent.  I am new to essential oils, but I bought this item because I love the smell of lemons and thought I&#x27;d try it out.  I use it in my laundry and my items come out smelling crisp and clean.  I will definitely be getting more so that I can continue my crisp clean scented sheets and clothing!</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;When I reviewed this product, I didn&#x27;t know too much about essential oils except people were using them to treat themselves medically. Depending on the certain oil treats certain things. My family is trying the whole all natural, organic lifestyle, so I decided to start looking into these oils, &amp; now i&#x27;m a lover of essential oils! I just recently used a concoction of coconut oil &amp; tea tree to remove a fever blister in record time. I&#x27;m hands down a believer in the treatment of essential oils. This is just another to add to my small but growing collection!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, excellent value.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Love NOW products!  This is a wonderful addition to any home!  It is great in a humidifier, in a watered down bottle as a home deodorizer and works well to drip some on tissue or cotton and vacuum up to scent the room nicely.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t affect allergies.  Love it and would buy again!</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my house smell so fresh.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in an ultrasonic diffuser when other essential oils I tried seemed too faint. It worked brilliantly. Lemon is, of course, a refreshing and clean smell anywhere it&#x27;s used, but in the diffuser it was strong enough to be distinct but not overpowering or artificial in any way. I should mention that when I received my order the plastic bottle cap was broken the whole way around. Only the plastic seal was holding it together and when that was taken off the top fell in two. Amazon, of course, is amazing and when I notified them they sent me a new bottle immediately and told me to keep the damaged one. So, a great essential oil from NOW, and best bought, in my opinion, from Amazon with their terrific service and guarantees!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my skin but the product says do not use on skin. Opps.&lt;br /&gt;I am not into diluting things. I like whatever I buy ready to go. This is not that. This needs TLC.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I still would recommend to buy it because it smells good and I am still going to see what happens if I use it on&lt;br /&gt;a small part of my skin. It is 100% lemon. What in the world would happen. I will test it on a part of my leg first for a month.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave another comment in a month or two.</li>
    <li> Excellent addition to my homemade cleaners.</li>
    <li> It is a bit pricey, but for its excellent quality, I would definitely buy again.  Is a larger size available?</li>
    <li> I bought this Now essential oil because I just pass by a store and decided to try it.  The smell is very pungeant and not nice to my sense of smell.  I tried a test:  put a drop of it on a piece of construction paper and wait a couple of hours.  If it leaves a ring on it is  not pure essential oil.</li>
    <li> Excellent high quality oil as is common for NOW products and the price is excellent.  Has a great smell and lasts too.</li>
    <li> Lemon essential oil is just amazing smelling. I&#x27;ve made my own tub and sink cleaner and it just leaves the bathroom smelling heavenly, not chemical smelling.  My only complaint is that I wish there was a dropper cap on it. I had to buy seperate eye droppers so that I wasn&#x27;t wasting it. The price for the size was great.</li>
    <li> My lemon tea and poppyseed cold process soap looks and smells like a loaf of poppy seed bread. I hope none of my buyers eat it...</li>
    <li> it has a lovely smell, but not very strong, you have to use a lot compared to other EO&#x27;s.. but for domestic use its ok.</li>
    <li> This is what lemon oil SHOULD smell like. I tried another brand before, and it was rancid, horrible, unusable. I had experience with the NOW brand for other oils, so I gave this one a try to replace the rank one. This was great. I could not be happier. It&#x27;s like you just fresh squeezed this oil out of actual lemon peels. So yummy!</li>
    <li> Great addition to my tea blend. I blend teas with oils and zest for both hot and cold tea. This is a great addition.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this smell!</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful! My cap arrived broken and I had to cover it with Saran Wrap, I could not contact them about it, I&#x27;m sure it will be fine with the plastic on. It was well insulated in the package and I think the only reason it did not leak was because of the shrink wrap holding the top together. I&#x27;m looking forward to using this! If you are using this in skin products, stay out of the sun, citrus and skin do not go together well.</li>
    <li> This is one of our favorite ingredient in making lip balm. Everyone loved it. Definitely going to order more if we ran out.</li>
    <li> Great oil. I am a newbie when it comes to essential oils.  I bought the Now Foods Lemon essential oil to use in my all natural disinfectants and multipurpose cleaners.</li>
    <li> Great oil....I use it in laundry detergent and it works great....it smells really good too...a must have for the product mixer</li>
    <li> A beautiful citrus aroma awaits, this oil is truly lemony bliss. I put it in my oil warmer to give my home invigorated scent. Love it!</li>
    <li> I first bought the 1oz and liked it. So I bought the 4oz but it doesn&#x27;t have a dropper. It only came with a disk with no hole in it and I think it&#x27;s just a seal - there&#x27;s no way you can punch a hole and use it as a dropper. But one day I was going to throw away my old &amp;#34;Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair&amp;#34; and I tried its dropper on the 4oz NOW bottle and it fit! At first it would only screw in half way but I used a little force and it went all the way down and sealed it really well. I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo.</li>
    <li> Use it in my washing machine to keep my laundry smelling fresh &amp; clean!</li>
    <li> Good lemon scent. Could be stronger? I haven&#x27;t smelt a stronger one before except in scented oils that are meant to produces strong aromas. It doesn&#x27;t smell like any portion of the lemon-oil mixture is missing from overheating or vaporization.</li>
    <li> This is one of my most-used oils - I use it for everything from skin care to cleaning to removing sticky residue. Also, five stars to NOW Foods Essential Oils. They are one of the best oils in the lower price range. I&#x27;ve been happy with all of my NOW oils.</li>
    <li> I buy a more expensive lemon oil that works for everything. I can apply it directly to my skin without a carrier oil with no reaction. This stuff burns me. I also use the more expensive oil to remove labels from bottles for crafting; however, this stuff couldn&#x27;t remove the labels. It does smell nice, so I diffuse it. It is ok, depending on what you need it for.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Now essential oils. Quality for a much lower price point than other essential oil brands. Any citrus scents are a particular favorite. This lemon is awesome to diffuse and I also use it in a face cream I make and wear each day. The only slight drawback is this 4oz size doesn&#x27;t have a dropper/stopper thing when pouring. I used this 4oz bottle to refill an empty 1oz bottle with a dropper and my problem was solved.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. Smells like fresh lemon. Many uses to produce clean fresh scent. Just a few drops needed. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for baking and for making cleaning and beauty items.  It smells heavenly and, for the price, I don&#x27;t have to be so conservative with it.</li>
    <li> Great deal and scent.</li>
    <li> timely delivery and good product.</li>
    <li> quality oil. great price</li>
    <li> I use lemon essential oil to clean vegetables and many other things in the kitchen.  Pour with care the bottle does not have a dropper insert.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand of essential oils, and this size is great because I use lemon EO for so many things. Right now I&#x27;m using it in my one year old&#x27;s room in her humidifier. Makes her room smell nice and fresh and purifies the air so that she doesn&#x27;t get congested.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time, as described by seller, excellent price, quality product. I use lemon essential oil for so many things that it is great to be able to buy this quantity and still get the high quality product. NOW Foods has excellent products.</li>
    <li> Received the item pretty fast within a week.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is good but unfortunately I lost most of the oil when I was trying to pour it into my drinking water.&lt;br /&gt;The producer should consider having droplets as dispenser so that there will not be any wastage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I would recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> I put this in my homemade body scrubs and just a few drops makes everything smell sooooo good! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this essential oil. I make my own cleansers, and this is exactly what I needed to cut the strong vinegar smells. Smells divine.</li>
    <li> I use it for refresh home repell mice and many other undesirable creatures in my home also use it with other oils for a body oil.</li>
    <li> Once they redesigned the labels they changed the quality of the product. Not as strong or as good but it does what I need. I use it to sprinkle around my house so it smells good</li>
    <li> The insert for the drop-counting fall off the first time I opened the bottle and it won&#x27;t stay put anymore. For the rest, the scent is great and the uses many.</li>
    <li> I have many other essential oils from &amp;#34;NOW,&amp;#34; and they all have this top that lets out a drop at a time. All of my 1 ounce bottles drip out without any problem. I have a 4 ounce bottle of rosemary oil that has the same top which works well. For some reason, maybe they recently changed the manufacturing, this bottle (and the 4 ounce orange oil I got) HAS the plastic, concave, drop lid, but it doesn&#x27;t work. It doesn&#x27;t actually stay on the amber bottle. The dropper lid just falls off, leaving me to pour. Bah.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to help fade my brown spots on my hands. I have to say it&#x27;s working which makes me happy!</li>
    <li> NOW Foods oils are of a consistently high quality. I have no questions when ordering them, because I know they will be exactly what I need.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently begun treating some long term conditions with essential oils, so I need to be able to trust the oils I buy. NOW oils are my first choice because they are high quality without being overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you are not using these oils for their therapeutic benefits, you will enjoy this oil. The smell is a pure, bright lemon smell that makes me think of springtime, sunshine, a cool breeze, big pitchers of lemonade, and a giant porch swing. A few drops on a cotton ball will let this refreshing lemon smell fill up your kitchen...try it, you&#x27;ll like it!! :-)</li>
    <li> Nice scent. The scent doesn&#x27;t have that longevity of some of the other essential oils I&#x27;ve tried. But I&#x27;ve never bought an essential oils you could use in food. This one says you can. Which I like very much. Great price. And  shipping.</li>
    <li> Great smell &amp; works well to repel moths!  I would &amp; have purchased it again!  **Note- Essential oils are not good to use around cats, it builds up in their system &amp; will make them very ill or kill them.  Just make sure to keep them out of the room you are using it in.  A cats liver lacks the ability to properly metabolize the various compounds in essential oils. This includes simmer pots and room spray, even pine kitty litter!! Citrus oils, cedar, tea tree and many more! I found out about this online, I did not know this when I started using oils &amp; am much more careful with Essential oils now.**</li>
    <li> just what i expected.</li>
    <li> Love love love this scent!! Strong scent. Soft lemon. Great for body butters, lip balms, or even in the oil warmer</li>
    <li> Very good quality. Product arrived on time and was as advertised. My only complaint is that, as an essential oil, only DROPS should be used. But it comes in an open bottle with nothing to control the flow of the oil or no dropper.</li>
    <li> Not only is this oil of outstanding quality, the value can&#x27;t be beaten anywhere else. I am a big fan of EO&#x27;s and will only use the top of the line oils for myself and my family and this brand ranks up at the very top for me. I trust them not only for diffusing but to use internally and in cooking. The label is also nice because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wear out&amp;#34; if oil gets on it. It&#x27;s a 5 star product all the way around.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, but the bottle doesn&#x27;t have a dropper lid where is suppose to be. It seems that it got stuck in the inside of the  black bottle cap(at least that what it looks like).......what the heck, how can I get it out of there so I can control the amount/drops of oil I can use. I will probably keep buying this NOW oils, but I doubt very much I will order them again from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - I also ordered a Lavender scent one, and have the same problem, dropper lid stuck inside of black bottle cap. Needless to say that I am disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> I like this oil and love than you get so much of it for the price. That being said, I will not be buying it again because of the bottle. As many other reviewers have said, the design of the bottle is incredibly flawed. There is no plastic covering attached to the opening of the bottle allowing you get drop by drop. Even after I pried the little plastic insert out of the bottle lid that is seemingly for that purpose the oil dumps EVERYWHERE EVERY TIME. So if you do buy this and use this know that you will have lemon oil all over your hands, counter, floor etc. I turns out to be not such a great deal because you end up wasting at least twice as much as you intend to use each and every time. The only way I would purchase this item again is the company redesigned the bottle. You are better off buying the big bottle from other companies that have included an eye dropper or the regular essential oil bottle with the plastic covering. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I love to scent our home , unfortunately my Husband gets horrible headaches when I use Bed an B_ _ H oils and it&#x27;s because they are not real  scents from the plant (flower, fruit etc.) When I use this (and NOW lavender oil) he walks in the house and says &amp;#34;Wow, it smells wonderful in here &amp;#34;  Try adding a drop of Patchouli oil to the mix, wonderful!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with oils to be able to compare or evaluate the product. It smells very nice and was much more economical than other brands. The problem is that the dropper is defective and will not go on the top of the bottle at all.</li>
    <li> While I tend use higher quality brands of essential oils for most uses, I got this for diffusing and using in my laundry.  The price was very good, and I was actually pleasantly surprised by the quality of the essential oil.  Only caveat with the 4oz size, at least, is that it comes without a dropper/dispenser insert, so pouring is kind of messy.</li>
    <li> I was worried this would smell fake like lemon scented floor cleaner but this is NOT the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 4oz per 8lb batch of soap.  It smells great and arrived with good packaging.</li>
    <li> I use this when making home made laundry soap.  Not only does it gives it a great smell it&#x27;s good for fighting germs and helping with stains.</li>
    <li> This brand of oils is the finest I&#x27;ve ever ordered. I&#x27;ll stick with them. Potent and fresh. I&#x27;LL ALWAYS USE THIS BRAND NOW.</li>
    <li> The price for this essential oil was definitely right.  It was of thinner consistency than I was expecting, but that certainly didn&#x27;t affect my end product - Lemon Sugar Scrub - for which I puchased it.  It smells amazing.</li>
    <li> this stuff works really like it now is a quality product yes i would buy this again &amp; again thanks</li>
    <li> I bought it from one of the distributor. I suspect it may be a defective product as the smell isn&#x27;t strong enough - felt as though it was diluted. 5* to the distributor -nature &amp; herbs. They were very nice and fully understanding. They immediately refunded w/o a need to return. I reached out to NOW foods. They were good too. Since it was an online purchase, they were willing to send me a voucher I could use for local purchase. In any case, the product may be defective but great customer service from both the distributor and the manufacturer. You can confidently buy these products.</li>
    <li> I use a few drops of this my cleaning solution of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap and water in a spray bottle. My whole kitchen smells good enough to eat. Holy &amp;^*@ this stuff smell so friggin good.</li>
    <li> Firstly, thanks to the company because my product arrived on-time and was even larger than I&#x27;d expected- what a great value. The dropper spout sadly does not stay in, as some of the other reviewers noted. If it weren&#x27;t for that, this would make it a 5-star product. That being said, it smells fantastic; kind of like Pledge but better because it&#x27;s natural and chemical-free. I like that I can spray it all over my home and not worry about carcinogens and bad stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I had read online that spiders detest lemon. So I scoured Google for a good recipe and mixed about a teaspoon&#x27;s worth of this with a few drops of Dawn in a spray bottle, filling the rest with water. Next, I sprayed behind every piece of furniture, door jams, vents, windowsills, electrical outlets, baseboards etc. I kid you not, the very next day I found 3 spiders! (EUW!) It must have forced them out of hiding!!! I used it again and the same thing happened. So I am continuing to use it and am finding less of the nasty bugger around..which truly gives me a good night&#x27;s sleep! I am definitely re-purchasing this when I run out.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way! I use this as a cleaner and it makes my house smell super fresh with just a little bit. The scent isnt over bearing and it smells way better than the commercial lemon scented cleaners you can buy. Love it</li>
    <li> I use this for cosmetic products and am very happy with it. Very potent aroma, can be a bit overwhelming if a touch too much is used. Only drawback is I would prefer it came in 12-16 oz. size because I have to buy so many units and they aren&#x27;t always available.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time! Great smell and taste!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find that the bottle didn&#x27;t have an eye dropper so you can control the amount of drops as it is very, very strong and oily so without the eye dropper you can easily put too much in and spill.</li>
    <li> This has such a fresh clean scent, it is amazing. We use it ina spray bottle with water and white distilled vinegar to freshen up curtains, and fabric colored furniture that get that stale smell after having the a/c on all the time. I also use it the soaps and lotions I make. As well as adding it to my beeswax when I make candles. Smells heavenly with those two blends. Love it!</li>
    <li> The package arrived quickly.  Well packed.  Needed it for a Young Women&#x27;s sugar scrub activity at church.  Essential oil scent is fragrant and the girls enjoyed using the product.  It only takes a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; to achieve the desired citrus fragrance.  Have the bottles on my shelf for the next batch of sugar scrub items.</li>
    <li> It was all handled in a timely manner and the oils are of good quality making my job easy and enjoyable</li>
    <li> Use this in all my cleaning.  In the washer, in my mixtures of floor cleaners.  I use this for so many things I can&#x27;t list them.  a must have.</li>
    <li> Very very lemony. Nice for candy making or adding that extra punch to baked goods.</li>
    <li> I use this as an element of a shower spray that I like to use to keep the bathroom smelling fresh and the shower walls clean.  I love the fresh smell!</li>
    <li> While the oil did NOT kill the spiders on contact, I did notice less of &amp;#34;the girls&amp;#34; after dousing the house with this lemony goodness. (A few online sources claimed the on-contact killing, but most sources agreed that it was merely a repelling product... Though this oil is not marketed as an arachnid-scarer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few suggestions for fellow would-be-spider-repellers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear a mask if you&#x27;re prone to migraines; I bought four bottles of this stuff from Amazon, and three from the local health foods store (as a test) and approximately 2.5 bottles took care of the 2800 foot house. The fumes from an ounce were bad enough, but two bottles plus... Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a ton of lemon oil, pay attention to the places that are not only dark in colour but in amount of light; corners of windows, anywhere the curtains or blinds bunch up, air conditioner vents in the ceiling (watch your eyes, though! This stuff stings quite a bit! Not that I know from experience, ahem.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to be mean to the husband-killing brats, leave the webs up and spray them! That way, oblivious flies still fly through the webs and stick (kinda, the oil makes them less sticky), and the naughty widows might just die of a broken heart, for love of their dinner, which is taunting them from a lemony web they can&#x27;t access anymore, Muahaha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Very good quality for this price! I would recommend this oil-- I use it as a bug repellant, with olive oil to &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; wood furniture and mixed with other EO&#x27;s and carrier oils for skincare and aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> Use this for homemade natural cleaning products. Good value and good quality for cleaning according to my certified aromatherapist.</li>
    <li> I got 2 of these and both of them the lid where it is suppose to drip out was off. Amazon gave me a refund, so that was nice</li>
    <li> This is a great product overall. It can be used in cleaning products, beauty essentials, diffusers... you name it! I love it. It smells so wonderful and clean. And fresh! It&#x27;s like opening a bottle of lemons at your will!</li>
    <li> The smell is so good the lemon fragrance change my mood in a second, so I knew this will be a great addition to my  ingredients for my hair proud  line ask well my lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Now Foods Essential Oil, Lemon scent is wonderful!  This essential lemon oil is definitely what you would want when you are looking for the scent of lemon.</li>
    <li> I have rescued dogs for 13 years so I have tile floors.  I have had many dogs over the years who were not house trained and would urinate on the floors.  In the past, I used white vinegar in hot water in the mop bucket.  But I now use the Now Lemon Essential Oil in hot water in the mop bucket and it is wonderful.  I love the clean fresh smell and the lemon essential oil is anti-bacterial and anti-fungal.  I was also very pleased with the price as I have used other brand names in the past that were more expensive.</li>
    <li> Bought this together with an incense burner that&#x27;s supposed to be for liquid essences. You can barely smell the lemon even after a couple of hours of running on high. Might be the fault of the burner, it uses a light bulb to heat the essence in a little clear bowl. Maybe this stuff would work better in a different type of burner, I dunno.</li>
    <li> i made my own hand sanitizer with this stuff and I love the smell. very refreshing and uplifting. also I put a small amount in my oil burner and it took away all the kitchen cooking smells. cheaper and better that air fresheners!</li>
    <li> The smell is spot on, sweet and lemony citrus. Very nice. Superb value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW Foods essential oils are very good, pure, therapeutic grade oils. This lemon EO is no exception. I use these oils in natural soaps I make as well as cleaning supplies.</li>
    <li> Good quality, with a clean and pure smell. I&#x27;ve been using it in an infuser, and it makes the house smell clean and invigorating without being overwhelming. A little goes a long way. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is strong!  I love it!  Smells so good.  I add a couple ounces to my homemade soap and it smells like lemon cake in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> I do not like it, not seller&#x27;s fault but this lemon is not what I thought, if u put in the water and drink it tastes very spicy and burning</li>
    <li> The oil appears to be of good quality and is what I expected to purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, high quality as all NOW Essential Oils are. Excellent fruity smell for the citrus lover. Would make a great furniture polish if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just want to state that there is NO CLASSIFICATION  by the FDA for &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34; Essential Oils. Do your research and do not be duped into purchasing expensive &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34; when such a thing doesn&#x27;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This review is solely based upon my independent review. I purchased this product. I was NOT given this product in exchange for a review.</li>
    <li> Good product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice large size bottle--very happy with product!</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product.  I use it for natural cleaning and remedies. A few drops in my brown sugar and honey face scrub. Love it. Smells good.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re not supposed to eat it</li>
    <li> I have the same issue that several others have had and that is the rubber piece comes out of the jar and it also blocked so even it was intact nothing would drop out.  I will be contacting Amazon about this defect.</li>
    <li> works perfectly in many uses! Bottle was a LOT larger than I expected which I&#x27;m very pleased with! Will order again!</li>
    <li> I love NOW products and lemon oil is a stable in my house because we just love the smell and it has multiple uses.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for headaches and sinus issues.</li>
    <li> Good product, but NO regulator/restrictor in bottle mouth.  You will need to purchase and use a dropper to control the amount you need to use.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have been using essential oils for a few years now.  I have tried and love several different brands, many claiming all sorts of things, but NOW makes a great quality product in my opinion.  We have used this for cleaning, getting the badge adhesive stuff out of scout uniforms, cleaning that awful pine gum off of hands and clothes, taking the sting out of mosquito bites, diffusing, mixing with lavender and peppermint to relive allergy flare ups, and so many more.  Lemon is probably one of my very favorite oils!</li>
    <li> I use essential oils for many different things.  This is great to simmer in a tart warmer or potpourri pot, but I also use it to add into the vinegar that I use as a cleaning product.  It helps to cut the smell of the vinegar.</li>
    <li> High quality essential oil. It works great for whatever you need to use it for. I recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. Wonderful, delicious scent. Not to strong or week, just right. Arrived in good time and packaged well. Woudl buy again from this company.</li>
    <li> SO good in my lemon-poppyseed cookies. Also in my bug-deterring spray of 10 drops oil to 8oz water in a spray bottle, spritzed in my doorways and corners.</li>
    <li> Great smell, and disinfectant using in homemade cleaners.</li>
    <li> This is great to use in the kitchen.</li>
    <li> Worth buying if for no other purpose than the super way it removes adhesive goo left from labels and price tags.  But also wonderful to wipe on just cleaned glass shower doors, to help keep them crystal clear for far longer.... helps repel hard water and soap film build-up....provides nice fresh smell, too.</li>
    <li> I got this to help control silverfish naturally. Mixed with water and sprayed it works great. I haven&#x27;t seen any since I sprayed. Bonus is it will not harm kids or pets. AND I can use it for food flavoring.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it said that it was food safe. I was making lemon pound cake and needed it. It didn&#x27;t really do much for the flavor and after reading the other reviews, I&#x27;m a little scared to use it for food anymore.</li>
    <li> NOW products are well worth the money. The lemon essential oil is so useful in the kitchen, bathroom and motor home (camping trips).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with lemon scent in the summer.  This is wonderful!</li>
    <li> It came with a defective dropper, stuck to lid, I can not return it because it is considered  hazardous material, I don&#x27;t see the option to contact the seller either.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.  Cleans well, smells like it should.  The only damper is the dropper isfaulty.  It is literally stuck inside the cap.  I pryedit it out only to find there is no hole in it for the EO to come through even if it did attach to the bottle correctly.  I punched my own hole in the dropper... But the dropper is manufactured incorrectly and doesn&#x27;t fit snugly into the mouth of the bottle.  Lots of leakage everywhere!  I applied the cover onto the bottle and once again, the dropper is wedged in the top.  I tried using a dropper from another NOW EO I have but the bottle necks are different sizes.  Ergh!</li>
    <li> it is a very good quality oil. I love it</li>
    <li> Love NOW products and their lemon oil is no exception. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great lemon EO. So many uses!!!!! I highly recommend it for glass cleaner!!! Vinegar, water, lemon EO. Bravo! 😄</li>
    <li> i love the scent of lemon; i use this in my homemade bathroom fragrance to spray in the toilet; it leaves a clean smell.</li>
    <li> Bright lemony fragrance and sharp lemon flavor.  Add a few drops to olive oil for cooking or salad dressing.  Use it as a perfume.  Anything you do with this you can&#x27;t go wrong....</li>
    <li> Bought this due to the value pricing and size.  Was so disappointed to find it smells rancid.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I liked this stuff a lot.  I used the first bottle, I like to put it in my laundry and my dryer.  I have recently ordered another bottle</li>
    <li> Smells as if I just cut open a bag of fresh lemons.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic. Use it all the time!</li>
    <li> Bought this to keep spiders out of my outside plastic shed. 20 drop of this, 2 drops dishwashing liquid, fill a 8oz. spray bottle with water. Have sprayed inside of shed once a week for several weeks now...so far so good!!</li>
    <li> Great value&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked!  For the money, they are a great product and I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I use lemon oil in home cleaning, holistic medical purposes and aroma therapy. This product is perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> I love using this in so many ways.  In the laundry, to add to DIY household cleaners and in my diffuser.  Also have used to make my own &amp;#34;poo-pourri&amp;#34; since the real stuff is so pricey and it works fabulous for that too!!!</li>
    <li> Ok... I&#x27;m torn! Love the oil, but the dropper portion was stuck in cap... So pretty much can&#x27;t use it... Sucks! I&#x27;ve never had this problem with smaller bottles but the last two large bottles I purchased... Suck! Bc I can&#x27;t use it as conveniently!</li>
    <li> Smells great, using it for diy cleaning agents. You can def smell the lemons in this bottle! Buy it-you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I use this to add a scent to my homemade floor cleaner and it does the job</li>
    <li> I love NOW Foods essential oils.  I use this in soap-making and it produces a strong, pleasant odor.  Excellent quality for the price.</li>
    <li> We use this oil as fragrance for hand soap and shampoo. It&#x27;s a great value and good quality for our use. We use about 10 drops mixed with 2 parts water and 1 part Dr. Bronners unscented baby soap in a foaming soap dispenser. I also use a few drops in the diaper bin or trash can and it&#x27;s fresh lemon scent helps.</li>
    <li> The little funnel was impractical. I can&#x27;t get just a few drops for adding to water. I always get too much and the oil burns my lips. Back to real lemons.</li>
    <li> Smells devine! Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this lemon oil.  I have always looked for a something that tastes like real lemons.  I use a couple of drops in my tea drinks and it is spectacular.  Thanks so much!  Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Great smell, stays with you.  I use it in my hair oil regimen and also mix with my body fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have been using Now Foods essential oils (occasionally abbreviated as eo) since 2005, they are a good quality oil without dealing with the MLM gimmicks of other essential oil companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now&#x27;s Lemon essential oil is a pleasantly scented citrus based oil that blends well with MANY other oils.  I often use Lemon in a base of coconut oil for skincare.  I also add Lemon to a blend of other citrus oils combined with bergamot oil for a quick pick me up when needed - this works GREAT in a diffusing humidifier!  Some MLM essential oil companies have a similar Lemon with citrus and bergamot oil blend called &amp;#34;Cheer Up Buttercup&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When blended with rosemary, eucalyptus, clove and cinnamon essential oils it is referred to as Thieves oil, reportedly since a band of thieves used a similar blend to avoid getting the plague when robbing corpses. (grim, but proves the oil&#x27;s effectiveness is well documented throughout history.)  Reportedly this blend is anti-viral and anti-bacterial. A common recipe for Thieves oil blend is:  (I&#x27;ve put the 1500 ml diffuser humidifer recipe in parenthesis)&lt;br /&gt;40 drops of Clove Essential Oil (6 drops)&lt;br /&gt;35 drops of Lemon Essential Oil (5 drops)&lt;br /&gt;20 drops of Cinnamon Essential Oil  (4 drops)&lt;br /&gt;15 drops of Eucalyptus Essential Oil (3 drops)&lt;br /&gt;10 drops of Rosemary Essential Oil  (2 drops)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tip of the day:  I add a few drops of Lemon essential oil to our vacuum cleaner bag for a fresh scent throughout our home when cleaning. If the vacuum is bagless, a few drops can be placed on a cotton ball that is then sucked up into the vacuum with the same benefits.</li>
    <li> I love Now brand!  This is exactly what I was needing to make more of a POP in my baked good and some lemon drinks!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love using this oil in my recipes - especially the ones that have fruit in them.  And what a lovely smell for use with aromatherapy!</li>
    <li> I just received the package, it was good packaging, but after I opened the bubble wrap, the lid was broken and oil was leaked around the bubble wrap, lid of the glass is broken.. I don&#x27;t accept this... oil was leaked all over around  the bottle .. lid is broken ...</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Good quality and used for everything around the house-- cleaning, candle scent.</li>
    <li> Smells GREAT! Helps lighten dark spots on my face and it also helps exfoliate cuticles with daily use. I mix it in with a cuticle oil.</li>
    <li> Now seems to have great quality oils and a lower price point than the major brands.  Really enjoy using my lemon oil in the dishwasher and it is amazing at cleaning grease off of stove hoods.</li>
    <li> i have used this product three Times now and am thrilled with the results. i use it in my soap recipes and it lends a beautiful fresh lemony scent thst smells natural and clean. buying more now!</li>
    <li> This is a really decent quality oil; like the others I buy form this brand for the price. No need to spend a ton of money when I am using them to stir away bugs and make my home smell nice</li>
    <li> I use the lemon oil mixed with water in a spray bottle as a deodorizer in my home as well as in my humidifier when I sleep.  I like to mix it with a bit of jasmine oil or lavender oil.  For a more masculine scent try Cedar oil with a bit of lemon oil in your home... it leaves a nice woodsy scent for the cold months.</li>
    <li> I make my own laundry soap so it is without additives. I use this Essential Oil of Lemon for a fresher wash</li>
    <li> This is great.  I love the smell of lemon and I actually bought this to use in the aroma therapy humidifier.  It gives the room a nice fresh lemon smell.  I have also used it mixed in with some shampoo to leave a lemon smell (probably not good for oilier hair but it works for me).  I am glad I found it and it seems to be priced reasaonably on Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle, great smell - wonderful price!  I&#x27;ve shopped around and Amazon actually had the best price for this.  Love it for cleaning or air fresheners!</li>
    <li> No cheap but well worth the expense. Mix with a diffuser like pure alcohol to make a great perfume of air freshner or pour on a small pile of frankincense in a bowl to create a nice room air freshner. The scent is very lemony and light which opens the head and does not create a headache.&lt;br /&gt;Truly smells like a fresh cut lemon. Can also be used on the hair to turn normal blond hair into Aryan looking platinum blond. The uses for this is great in drinks as well- a few drops in a tumbler of ice with water and pernod or vodka makes a great drink.</li>
    <li> Love the lemon oil and the cost was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> No lie.  I left food in the oven too long and it burnt and scorched.  My house reeked of burnt scorched pan.  I didn&#x27;t want to smell it going to bed, so I put this in the oil burner with water and it smelled wonderful.  I was saved.  The smell is awesome and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> 3-4 drops of lemon oil in my water---and I become an alkalized machine!  eat it up it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Lemon essential oil is super versatile and can be ingested so I thought this was a pretty good buy for 4 ounces.  It doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper built in- it&#x27;s completely open so I had an accident and put nearly 2 teaspoons in my water.  I went to put the lid back on after I cleaned up my mess and I broke the lid!  I&#x27;m not some super bionic woman that was upset over spilled lemon essential oil or anything.  All I did was pick up the lid and place it on top of the bottle and it crumbled in my fingers!  I didn&#x27;t even get to twist it on!  To make matters worse, I put 2 drops of it in my water later that day, and my lips tingle like I&#x27;m having a weird allergic reaction!  I bought this same brand in Grapefruit and haven&#x27;t had any of these problems.  Maybe it was a lemon??? (Pun unintentional)</li>
    <li> Good quality. Works well for homemade cleaning supplies.</li>
    <li> Great service and product, but bottle doesn&#x27;t have built in dropper, making it hard to pour when using.</li>
    <li> this is a good lemon oil-  i like adding 2 drops in a large bottle of water and drinking it all day.  very refreshing.  this and the grapefruit can be addicting on a hot summer day.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I use this for making my homemade cleaning products. This product does not disappoint. Good value for my money</li>
    <li> This is a miracle cleaning agent!</li>
    <li> Not pure oil. Erroneous ads. Terrible for essential oil use. Ok for use in water.</li>
    <li> Love the oil but my jar came with a defective plastic topper.  This makes it very difficult to use and results in product waste.  I have had this issue with all of the NOW oils in the 4oz size.  The 1oz bottles do not have this issue.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh,clean smell of lemon. I use it as an alternative to chemical cleaners and it work&#x27;s wonder.Just mix some in baking soda and water to clean the kitchen or add a few drops the laundry detergent. It smells so fresh!!!!</li>
    <li> What good is a bottle of essential oil without a dropper cap?  I went to use it and spilled half the bottle.  I will not consider this size for future purchases, which is a shame because it&#x27;s the quantity I need.</li>
    <li> I love all of the NOW essential oils.  My husband is really fond of citrus so I got the lemon in a large size.</li>
    <li> This oil smells very good.  I use it in my diffuser and also put on cotton balls around the house.  Very strong so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
    <li> NOW products are great.  They are always high quality.</li>
    <li> Love now foods brand, great price</li>
    <li> bought ir to make cleaning supplies. Works nicely</li>
    <li> Great price, quick delivery. Very happy</li>
    <li> Awesome fragrance! Only need to use a bit and the room wakes up!</li>
    <li> There are so many uses for lemon oil.  It gives soothing pain relief and has an uplifting fragrance.  I put a drop or two on my microfiber dusting clothes.  It will also remove most stains from clothing.  Just put a drop or two on the stain and a little dish soap and gently rub the fabric together.  Leave it a few hours and then wash as usual.  Most stains come out.</li>
    <li> This NOW Foods Lemon Oil is a great essential oil to use singularly with a carrier oil, (I most often use almond oil as my carrier), mixing with other essential oils to create a custom scent for your skin, room freshening/deodorizing, and for making your own homemade cleaning products that leave a fabulous scent behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lemon scent itself is clean and bright with no heaviness or odd undertones, and is a great scent to help perk you up. I enjoy mixing this with orange oil with almond oil, and dab on pulse points (that will not be exposed to sunlight, as these essential oils can cause skin irritation for many when exposed to sunlight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you don&#x27;t know, this doesn&#x27;t come with it&#x27;s own dropper, so you may want to have one ready. The quality, strength, scent, value and \\&quot;multi-purposefulness\\&quot; of this lemon oil has made a wonderful addition to my essential oil stock and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good but it seems less concentrated than other lemon oil I&#x27;ve used (doterra), it seems more watery. The price per volume is excellent though so it makes up for it. I put this in my water &amp; drink it &amp; cook with it.</li>
    <li> I was surprised there was no dropper (any type for that matter) when I opened this.  I have a diffuser and I tipped the bottle of this to slowly get it in there and it dribbled down the side and landed on my counter top instead of in the diffuser.  I just had to adjust the position of the bottle in the air so it would dribble into the diffuser and not on the counter.  It&#x27;s a little disappointing, since I buy other Now Foods oils which have some sort of dropper.  I just wish this one did.  It would make things easier.  Otherwise, great lemon smell and product!</li>
    <li> love this oil... i use it on my lower back, and solar plexus area, for a quick pick me up... also on the soles of my feet to help with picking up earth chi and that helps with blood pressure..</li>
    <li> I had read other reviews about the fact that this oil doesn&#x27;t come with a dropper -- but I forgot when I got it and I wasted quite a bit accidentally unfortunately, being used to essential oil bottles with a dropper top...but the oil smells great.</li>
    <li> I use this to scent soaps, lotions, perfumes, candles and I add it to my floor washes and window cleansers for the smell and the added cleaning power. The bottle is nice and big and I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I love lemons to begin with..this oil is strong and will sting your skin in sensitive areas, but it smells so good...just like a basket of pretty lemons.</li>
    <li> Only reason I give them 4 stars is because it does not come with a dropper.</li>
    <li> Clean smell refreshing</li>
    <li> Perfect for making carpet cleaner.Mixes very easily and the scent lasts a long time a a a a a a</li>
    <li> fast delivery low price AAA !!!</li>
    <li> This essential oil really gives a lemon flavor to foods without having to grate the peel or add too much liquid to a recipe.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t used lemon essential oil before so it could be great, I just thought it wasn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
    <li> Awesome, smell great.</li>
    <li> Great oil.  I use a lot of it for all sorts of things. I use it for cleaning and for diffusing. Makes the house smell great. Mix with other essential oils for a diffuser blend.</li>
    <li> Love Lemon Essential Fragrance in my health and beauty products it&#x27;s the best; awesome fragrance...nice citrus scent. Real lemony scent...</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I expected.</li>
    <li> This&#x27;s great--makes the house smell wonderful and fresh. It also cuases no-seeums away, because they don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> This product is a great price for such a large bottle and of course it smells wonderful in the cleaners.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use in the kitchen. I sprinkle a few drops in the cardboard tube of each paper towel roll before setting it on its stand and also sprinkle drops in the sink and dishwasher. Refreshing and clean smelling. I plan to keep it on hand. Nice!</li>
    <li> I used it in my scrub for the bathtub shower and toilet.  I love the way it smells.  I thought it would have a dropper top like the other essential oils but it just pours out.  I guess I have to get an eye dropper.</li>
    <li> I had this product for a bit now.  I do what other sites recommend.  Lemon oil + dish soap + water.  I been spraying around the house just about every 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason im writing this now?  Im in my kitchen getting some burritos ready and while im walking to the fridge I see a huge black dot on the ceiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in norcal so we don&#x27;t get huge nasty spiders.  We probably live in the best place in the world in terms of dangerous animals (barely any here).  This one was dark black with a maroonish  abdomen with the spider about the size of a half dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it, I was like &amp;#34;aw snap.&amp;#34;  It was like my whole life flash in front of me .  Then in my flashback, I recall one day reading about some one mentioning on here that you can also use the prevent spray to blast spiders to death &amp;#34;eco friendly&amp;#34; style.  So I got my spray and snuck up on it like Call of Duty style and blasted the fool.  Sucker fell down from the ceiling balled up.  I blasted it some more.  Then I gave it its proper burial.... wrapped the sob up in toilet paper and flushed it down the throne... porcelain throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this lemon oil combo didn&#x27;t work, that spider could easily be typing up a taunt telling how the lemon oil didn&#x27;t work but it did.  I walked out alive.</li>
    <li> I love this lemon oil.  I add a few drops to my water every day.  I add it to unscented dish soap and hand soap for extra cleaning power and a wonderful fresh scent.  The only drawback is that for the four ounce size there is no dropper included, you need to transfer the oil or use pipettes.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. I use it for homemade carpet fresh (1 cup baking soda + a few drops of scent, mix well with a fork or shake in a container) and let it sit while I clean the rest of the house... It smells so clean and fresh!! I will order again and again from Now Foods. I like the citrus smells for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I will NEVER use lemon extract again! The flavor you get from this oil is amazing!!! Makes a killer lemon cream cheese pound cake! You don&#x27;t need a lot in your recipes either,  also it&#x27;s priced excellently! I went to a local store and purchased a smaller bottle for $6...I will always order from Amazon from now on!</li>
    <li> Yum!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to deodorize our home by mixing with baking soda and sprinkling on to our carpets.&lt;br /&gt;Works well and smells great!</li>
    <li> Great price, great oil,</li>
    <li> This smells so good.  Refreshing scent that makes you smile.  We use it to make home made deodorant and home made kitchen cleaner.</li>
    <li> Good product, but bottle came without a dropper causing me to consistently pour more oil than I need.  This is a very strong and potent oil, be very careful when using it, because it could easily burn your skin.  A small, small DROP goes a long way.  This bottle will last you a very long time.</li>
    <li> bottle in this size does not have the &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34; in the bottle so have to mess around with a pipette.</li>
    <li> Scent wasn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be. I was going for a true strong lemon scent. I know it&#x27;s pure essential oils but having bought many scents from this brand I was disappointed with this one. In addition, the plastic dropper was broken on arrival so That bothered me. Don&#x27;t mail defective products.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing without being to overpowering, this coming from someone who is very sensitive to smells. I&#x27;ve used it for both cleaning and deodorizing the house. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy other scents of this brand.</li>
    <li> I use this for EVERYTHING! Put it your lotion to amplify your tan ( its also said to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, but I havent noticed a difference. It does firm the skin though). I use this to make all prupose cleaner, and in my mop water to kill germs and freshen the house. I put a few drops of it in my drinking water for a great lemon taste. Ive even used it to lighten my hair. My husband is sold on it as well, and he was skeptical.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with the quality of the NOW essential oils, and the lemon is no exception! Great value, great product.</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this lemon oil.  It&#x27;s a good quality product which I do recommend.  I use it in many of my body products to brighten them...top note...This product is also great for a natural spider repellent...........thesoapmaker.net</li>
    <li> The lemon is perfect! Smells just like a fresh squeezed lemon!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the oil however I do not like the fact that it is missing a stopper.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Makes my homemade counter top spray that much more effective and of course it smells outstanding.</li>
    <li> Nice big bottle for a nice price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I loved this oil, smelled great !!!</li>
    <li> This is Great! We use it for deodorizing/energizing scent in our home. A good quality oil, great price. We will buy this again.</li>
    <li> OMG this smells awesome...I used it in my beauty products and for cleaning and I still have a full bottle left. A little goes a long way. This oil rox :)</li>
    <li> It smells like lemongrass, but it&#x27;s just pure lemon oil. It&#x27;s nice in a reed diffuser. I also use it on my heavy paper face mask, for changing the litter boxes. It really does block the odors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m unsure if this is 100% essential oil. It doesn&#x27;t seem as concentrated as other brands</li>
    <li> Smells delicious. Best deal i could find. Lemon oil is a great use for bug spray, cleaning, natural deodorant with baking and soda and much more uses.</li>
    <li> This is over all really great and the product itself is good.  Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a dropper top.  I ended up pouring out much more than intended, so then I unsuccessfully tried a straw transfer method.  I purchased pipettes and  they work great.</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality, size, and price. We use it to make our own bug spray.</li>
    <li> Wonderful aroma. I&#x27;ve put it to use in homemade bathroom spray, cleaners and dropped into my Epsom Salts&#x27; bath for a pick-me-up.</li>
    <li> I love the actual oil, but the bottle&#x27;s lid-dropper didn&#x27;t work. My husband went to drop some in our diffuser and lost half the bottle because the top fell off. So now we use a dropper and that works better.</li>
    <li> because its very important for me and my babies, they are use everynight, i love it i need i want thanks for everything excellent oil</li>
    <li> Good but not great,  Edens Garden&#x27;s smell better but for the price not bad.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing! giant bottle and very cheap! worth every penny.  i use it as perfume and my sister uses it in her hair in a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance!  I use this for making laundry soap at home and love the fresh scent!</li>
    <li> I bought a verity of oils they smell wonderful. They arrived quickly. 4 oz is not a large amount but mixed with other nonflammable liquids it provides a nice scent in the home. I spray it on the dog pillows but not too much I don’t want them to be over whelmed.</li>
    <li> Love the citrusy smell. The oil is concentrated and goes a long way. We used it to scent dish soap and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works well as a diffuse, the smell goes away quickly and it didn&#x27;t seem to offer the cleansing properties that the nutritionists said it would.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is okay. Not a real strong lemon smell to it. I use this for cleaning products only. Probably will buy something else next time since Lemon oil is pretty cheap all around, go for one with a stronger lemon scent.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and arrived within the specified time frame.</li>
    <li> Great oil. New to the essential oil thing, but this oil is wonderful. I have made some wonderful smelling salt scrub. It is great. The 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t have any way to just make a few drops. The top is open and you can easily use to much.</li>
    <li> We look our ice tea sour, you don;t need much of this to do thejob.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. I wish the cap had a dropper attached.  It would be easier to use.  Other than that, product is fine.</li>
    <li> Love lemon, favorite smell. But I could not sense this aroma for very long. But also, I cannot smell some things so it could be me</li>
    <li> Perfect to use for so many different things!  There is no euro dropper or anything, however, there is a little plastic piece that gets stuck inside the cap.  I read in another review to use a butter knife to get it out and put it on as a dropper, but mine will not work.  I got it out, but there is not way to get it to attach to the mouth of the bottle.  It just sits there.  Very, very annoyed by this as I have to use a piece of straw to get some out of the bottle and wash that each time.</li>
    <li> works great in my night lite warmer, makes the whole area smell fresh and fruity.  Great added to my all around household clean spray too.</li>
    <li> So, I love the smell... but I already knew that because I&#x27;ve purchased this product before in Whole Foods. HOWEVER, this particular bottle/seller did not come with a &amp;#34;one drop at a time&amp;#34; diffuser. Yes, there was some plastic gadget stuck in the lid (as some reviewers have noted) but even after I pried it out with a paperclip, it did not fit securely on the top of the bottle, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous bottles I have purchased (same product) from local stores came with a &amp;#34;one drop at a time&amp;#34; diffuser thing already installed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the smell and quality of the oil itself gets 5 stars, but the bottle construction and lack of a real dropper-thing really stink because I feel like I&#x27;m going to be pouring out too much oil at any given moment, even if I try really hard to only get a few drops.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and came very fresh with excellent date</li>
    <li> I love the &amp;#34;Now&amp;#34; brand of oils...we&#x27;ve ordered a dozen different essential oils, and I can&#x27;t tell a difference at all between this brand and the name brand ones.  Save some money and get this brand.</li>
    <li> I use pure lemon oil to remove grease spots in laundry. Sometimes it is hard to find pure lemon oil. This is pure and works great for my purposes.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome! It smells exactly like you would imagine a fresh lemon to smell! I use it a lot and there is still a tone left! I make homemade dish soap and all purpose cleaner and scent them with this. It smells amazing and fresh! I have also made lip balm with it and love it!</li>
    <li> This smells amazing!  I used it in homemade soap and deodorant.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> Seems like an all natural product, Color, smell, is good.  Wish more lemon flavor.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite! I get headaches and I use a little lemon oil and it takes my headache away. I mix with water so it&#x27;s not so strong, because it can burn your skin if not careful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this lemon essential oil mixed with straight vinegar and  as a cleaning solution. I have to say... my home smells lovely! I really like the freshness this oil brings to my mundane cleaning routine, sort of cheers me up as it freshens up. Heh</li>
    <li> I use this for polishing leather &amp; wood furniture; cleaning up shoes, making the house smell fresh or adding to fabric softener to keep towels fresh.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of lemon in the morning - this oil is great!  I really like the NOW brand of essential oils (see my other reviews!) and they didn&#x27;t disappoint me with this Lemon!  No bitter smell, great size - took one star off for the lack of dropper-top which I don&#x27;t remember seeing mentioned - really miss that!!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this oil. We use it diluted to spray on houseplants to defeat aphids and it works. I also combine with vinegar and water for a mild cleaner. I have read that it can be used for lemon flavoring but I use lemon juice concentrate for that purpose. This has a very uplifting scent - spray in some water around the house to freshen the air.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this several times now.  I use it in almost all of my homemade cleaning products.  Smells great and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> The garbage disposal seemed to always have some unpleasant scent to it no matter what I tried. I thought I would give this a try because I love the lemon scent....it smells so clean. A few drops in the sink and the kitchen smells so clean no more nasty garbage disposal smell. The fresh smell lasts as long as I don&#x27;t wash it away. Very glad that I purchased this.</li>
    <li> This is by far the weakest lemon essential oil that I have ever purchased. Even straight out of the bottle it is very weak, and using double amounts of drops in my diffuser didn&#x27;t help.......all I seemed to smell was the carrier oil, and it&#x27;s not very pleasant. I have been pleased with other NOW oils, especially the lavender, but I am very disappointed with the lemon, and will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Glass bottle meant allot to me. There is no trace of chemical smell/fumes . Natural ,as it described on the label-I guess;) A bit on a weak side,but maybe its just my stuffed nose (seasonal allergy ;)</li>
    <li> ... for making my own household cleaning/laundry solutions.  Clear, clean, potent smell.  A little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use in my homemade laundry detergent.  Helps with a bit of germ control and smells great!</li>
    <li> Not recommended since the food grade lemon oil did not include any comments on use and concentration equivalents and what amount to use in recipes that call for lemon oil.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely delicious</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly, works well. No dropper on the bottle though.</li>
    <li> I am leaving one star because the bottle does not permit dispensing by the drop. For an essential oil, this is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> Be very careful opening safety seal. It&#x27;s tougher than most causing me to drop it before I could get it open. It broke on the floor. What a mess! It smelled wonderful cleaning up. Just be careful.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t even been able to use the product yet due to the stopper not even fitting the bottle.  Had to wait for an order of additional supplies so that I could dispense this properly.  Anyone that even glanced at this bottle would be able to see that the stopper just &#x27;rests&#x27; on the top...sticking 1/4in out of the top of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Very potent and authentic lemon smell! The only reason I gave it four stars is the lack of a dropper.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;*The price point on this product is very good (at least at this writing).&lt;br /&gt;*Seems as effective as other brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;*It is not possible to pour a tiny amount out - it just runs down the side of the bottle or you get much more than you needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  I don&#x27;t use it as often as I would if I had it in another jar.</li>
    <li> huge bottle for the price. smells just like you squeezed lemons in the kitchen. i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Using this for many purposes and spray aplication</li>
    <li> I love the NOW brand of essential oils. I&#x27;ve used other brands, and this one can easily compare to those. They are always at a price you can&#x27;t beat. The lemon I received was amazing.</li>
    <li> really like this essential oil. 5 stars for price, quality, fast shipping. thanks!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell. I added it to soy candles and it is a fantastic scent. Needs some kind of dropper. When I went to pour a little a bunch poured out.</li>
    <li> Love this product. goes in my rinse water. In my drinking water. Just to freshen up a room - put just one drop on a COLD lightbulb- then turn it on---- Mmmm smells yummy</li>
    <li> LOVE the product, HATE the bottle. The lemon oil is the best for many things around our house. The only problem is that the slow drip cap has come off upon the first opening of the bottle. Now the only way to get an accurate measure aside from pouring it is to use a dropper. Good price for the product so I&#x27;ll just keep using my dropper and wonderful oil</li>
    <li> very nice lemon.  thank you</li>
    <li> One of my favorites for diffusing. Lemon adds a wonderful punch to almost any essential oil blend. I&#x27;ve probably used more of my lemon than any of the other couple dozen I own.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! I use it for everything there is to do with cleaning. Love this product and have been using it for years!</li>
    <li> only purchase essential oils from NOW have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the smell of anything lemon. This makes my homemade soap smell fantastic! Works well in my melt and pour bases.</li>
    <li> Great oils at great prices, the shipping was fast!...will order again!</li>
    <li> Now is one of the best makers of pure essential oils, in my opinion. Therefore, they&#x27;re usually more expensive than other companies. I think this was a very good deal for the amount of oil you get. I hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up by the time i need more. I use it as perfume, and to sent my pillows. I paid just over $11 for this. Highly recommend this company!</li>
    <li> The oil is exactly what i wanted/needed, but i was sad to find that unlike the smaller bottles which have dropper tops, this one does not. There was a small clear plastic lid under the black lid that just came off as i went to tip the bottle to use it but i guess that was just an extra seal for shipping?? After reading more of the reviews after i had already recieved it i noticed others had similar experiences. I feel the seller should really put that in their descripition.</li>
    <li> I add this to my lotions and liquid soap. in my spray dispenser to clean the whole house and floors mixed with a bit of liquid detergent/water.  the smell is fresh and clean and I always have some on hand.</li>
    <li> Great price for the oil, but bad dispensing system. No dropper mechanism, the thing in the top doesn&#x27;t actually attach to the bottle so I don&#x27;t see it&#x27;s point. And without it, it just runs down the side of the bottle when you try to pour it. But if you don&#x27;t mind pouring this into another bottle with a dropper or travel lotion dispenser, it&#x27;s a great price and smells exactly as fresh and lemony as it should.</li>
    <li> Great value good strong scent will use this in soaps, and creams, and more things that I make</li>
    <li> Lemon freshness I used this in oil burners and in my homemade soy candles and this worked very well smells real lemons</li>
    <li> I use a few drops directly on the floor when cleaning with my steam mop, it infuses the room with a lovely scent that&#x27;s not overpowering and does not give me a headache like store bought cleaning products tend to do. It&#x27;s all natural so I don&#x27;t have to worry about kids or pets getting nasty chemicals on their hands or paws. This essential oil is multi purpose I recommend looking online for ideas on various ways to use it. I&#x27;ve used it when making lemon bars (that turned out super tasty), added to oil diffuser or a steam bath, and used it in my homemade bug repellent spray/bars.</li>
    <li> Great for getting out stains in laundry.  Great size and price.</li>
    <li> Love this for bug s and for brightening up the house.  Just mix with warm water and spray!</li>
    <li> I  love the lemon fragrance and had hoped to use it around the house in many different ways.  The few times I have used it I have been disappointed because the fragrance was barely noticeable and certainly not long-lasting.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this oil. It smells great and is of good quality. You smell the lemon without any fillers. I will buy this brand again..</li>
    <li> I bought this lemon oil to repel spiders that seemed to like the inside of our new house. I put about 15-20 drops of lemon oil in a small spray bottle, add one or two drops of dishwashing liquid (to help dilute the lemon oil which is not water soluble by itself) and then fill up with water. Then I spray all the entrances into the house on the inside (door posts, windows, etc.). I also spray corners inside the house and all places where spiders might like to hide. The trick is to use this inside the house only - spiders hate lemon oil and stay out of your house. In fact, I have seen a spider die from one direct spray of this lemon water! We have not had problems with spiders since we started to use this product. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a problem with spiders in the house. Plus your house will smell great!</li>
    <li> MMMMMM. Yummy smelling. I use it in a reed/stick diffuser and put a few drops in the water pot on my Wood pellet stove. Keeps the air moisturized and smelling nice, with the water/oil combo. Great for every home. Reliable seller. Trustworthy. I am going to make up the bug repellent brew i just read on here. Especially as a deterrent against spiders. This OlD home we live in needs such a product. Eco-friendly, here we come!</li>
    <li> NOW foods offers good quality oils for a good price. I have never had a problem with any of their oils. I don&#x27;t trust the dropper that comes with it, as it is usually a little loose and I have had one fall off while using it before. I just bought a bag of disposable pipettes that I use with my oils.</li>
    <li> I like the oil, it&#x27;s great, but what&#x27;s not so great is that they fail to include the kind of top that allows you to add drops, instead of it just pouring out. Come on, why is on the smaller sizes, but not this?</li>
    <li> It is what it is, Lemon Essential Oil, don&#x27;t know what else I can really say about it. Lemon Essential Oil.</li>
    <li> The price/size ratio is really good and the oil is acceptable, but I have the impression the quality is subpar to many other lemon oils you can get on Amazon. To me it doesn&#x27;t seem as concentrated, and my wife even says this one smells different, kind of artificial. It&#x27;s hard to put your finger on the difference, but after a couple of baths and aromatherapies the difference is evident. So, we will be going back to the more expensive oils we&#x27;ve gotten used to.</li>
    <li> It smells like a fresh cut lemon. Had to take 1 star off because the dropper cap came right off. I bought a medicine dropper so all is well again.</li>
    <li> What a lovely fragrance!  High quality, and pure scent.  Works well with castile soap for floors and in coconut oil for face creme. Also I use it on the dogs to help ward off the fleas.</li>
    <li> I use this for tons of cleaning chores around the house - added to teenage son&#x27;s laundry, with a little baking soda to refresh the sink disposal, in some vinegar to clean out the trash cans, etc. A little goes a long way. This bottle lasts me for months and I use some every single day.</li>
    <li> I bought this bottle to add into my home made wood cleaner.  Lemon has lots of anti-septic qualities, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;m happy with the results, not to mention the scent is fresh and welcoming.</li>
    <li> Nice oils worked perfect!</li>
    <li> The NOW brand is reputable and this lemon essential oil is the genuine thing from what I can tell. It has the aroma of fresh lemon citrus, and the label has it at 100% pure. It should be used with caution as it is genuine essential oil. I use it for my hair scalp treatments (dandruff and sebum production regulation) and for soothing my cramps (when used as a blend). Works great!</li>
    <li> I liked this lemon oil. Smelled good and was what I had hoped it would be. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I recently started mixing up my own cleaning products to get away from using so many chemicals in my home. I&#x27;ve added this lemon oil to the toilet bowl cleaner I made (borax, washing soda and lemon oil) and homemade furniture polish (olive oil, vinegar and lemon oil). I&#x27;ve even added it to the organic unscented floor cleaner that I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used to have very obvious pet odors, but after a couple weeks of cleaning with this oil, the odor is gone, and my whole home has a light lemon scent. The scent is not over-powering like a chemical lemon scent might be. It just smells clean.By the way, the scent lasts about 3 days on floors, longer on our wood furniture, but the pet odor has not returned at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using NOW products and supplements for years and have always found them to be good quality. My next experiment will be homemade laundry soap (castile soap and borax dissolved in hot water) with a bit of [[ASIN:B002N0PY8S NOW Foods Lavender Oil, 2 ounce]].</li>
    <li> as all Now products...great.  smells amazing.</li>
    <li> A little on the watery side but that may be normal.  Use it for house cleaning and teas as well as difuser.  Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> I use a bit of this and a bit of lavendar oil with a little alcohol and water for a nice bathroom deodorizer.  This came without a dropper, tho.  The lavendar oil had one, which I like.</li>
    <li> Smells so nice!  I used this to make a natural sugar body scrub and I had so many people asking me what smelled so good in it.  Great quality oil.</li>
    <li> Always a great product ! Arrived early , packaged well ... Will order again</li>
    <li> Now Food Essential Oils are great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Strong aroma&lt;br /&gt;+ great natural remedies&lt;br /&gt;+ Smells wonderful for DIY Home cleaning agent&lt;br /&gt;+ one bottle last a very long time</li>
    <li> Great scent, arrived on time, large bottle so a good value</li>
    <li> I use this for baking and for homemade cleaners.  I got so addicted to this scent that I bought 2 more bottles.  I love the real smell of this.  It&#x27;s awesome, and authentic.  My house smells so great when I use my cleaner with this added!</li>
    <li> this is great stuff to use instead of the awful smelling sprays you buy plus it helps to relieve stress!!!</li>
    <li> buyer beware: I thought it would have a dropper top like the smaller bottles do but its just open! And it doesn&#x27;t even come with an eye dropper screw on lid! But the oil itself, is just lovely</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m using it for homemade cleaners and it smells wonderful and fresh! I recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> Love this product in my water.  Great flavor with just a few drops.</li>
    <li> most I have tried in the past do not smell like real lemon this brand does : )</li>
    <li> Mix with a small amount of Olive Oil, or other oil, and gently rub areas of pain from stress, arthritis etc.  It really does work.  If you are doubtful, do just a little reseach on essential oils.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> I wish it came with a dropper or something so It wasn&#x27;t so annoying to measure out. Oh well, smells nice.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase for lemon essential oil.I have others but I am no expert in lemon:) I will say this it smells excellent!! I am not disappointed at all,very happy how strong it smells! It shipped fast and safe ,no spills!!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that you will need your own dropper due to the awful dropper lid design ,it&#x27;s not like their others essential oil dropper lids on their lavender or cedarwood oils. This one is not tight,it doesn&#x27;t even clip inside the bottle. It literally is a mini funnel and you can slide it off the bottle with a flick of your finger,just awful:( but I would order again it anyway.It&#x27;s still good for the price and smells delish!!</li>
    <li> I use essential oils for washing my hair because I do the &amp;#34;no shampoo&amp;#34; thing which involves washing your hair with apple cider vinegar and baking soda. Washing my hair with essential oils ensures my hair smells nicer. I used peppermint oil before this and I liked the smell a lot better. I used the lemon as a air freshener as well (put it in spray bottle with witchhazel and water) and it just smelled okay. So many people commented that they love the lemon smell because it smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; but it just makes me think of cleaning products rather &amp;#34;nature.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I use this esencial oil to make natural cleaning supplies for my home. The oil is excellent and a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for removing sticky residue.EX: (Labels off jars, band-aide residue, tape including duct tape, probably even gum). The price is great for cleaning purposes.Nice lemon scent. Although some of Now brand is organic, I have found Young Living to work the best medicinally.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a good price for 4 oz of lemon oil.  I have been buying Now Foods essential oils for 12 years and have always been satisfied.  I use this oil for cleaning, disinfecting and deodorizing.  A little goes a long way ~ enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product as a digestive aid and it is soon to tell the long term results.  So far it seems to be satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Used it making my bathroom smell good. Love it.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean the granite counter tops. It cuts grease and at the same time conditions so the counter tops have a amazing shine with NO residue that chemical cleaners do. I feel safe cooking on my counter tops with a product that is not harmful. Plus my kitchen smells amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I put some in my tea everyday - Love it!</li>
    <li> We use lemon oil for all kinds of cleaning, and this bottle goes a long way. The antiseptic properties make this excellent for cleaning, and the strong scent makes the whole house smell clean. This is a great value for the price, and we&#x27;ll definitely order again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I thought the smell was more lemon zest and less lemon juice like, but in any case, the smell was still very good and very strong. I like it.</li>
    <li> I think it is better. I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of simple ingredients to make my own cleaners, including vinegar. While the vinegar smell does just dissipate quickly, it&#x27;s nice to have the subtle and fresh smell of lemon left behind. My whole house smells so healthy and clean. This is a great deal on Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> All I can say is this----&gt; WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I ordered 2 bottles&lt;br /&gt;Took a chance on this. Its amazing! A Few Drops in the oil warmers&lt;br /&gt;and also a few drops on the Furnace filter.&lt;br /&gt;The Place smells AMAZING and FRESH!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will Re order this for sure.&lt;br /&gt;So worth it!</li>
    <li> Enjoyed the oil, although I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s therapeutic grade since it&#x27;s for aromatherapy use only.  Burns well for the house.</li>
    <li> love it.  no complaints. great smell.</li>
    <li> The 1 oz and 2 oz bottle have tops that only allow drops to come out however the 4 oz bottles doesn&#x27;t and there is no dropper or anything to use with it so I completely spilled it the first time I used it. Luckily it smelled good.</li>
    <li> This oil is &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34;, so reviews shouldn&#x27;t matter right?  I mean... you literally HAVE to have essential things right?  So buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it and some other top secret ingredients to make &amp;#34;organic hippie shower spray&amp;#34;.  Keeps the mold AND the hippies away!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as others</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it every week to add fragrance to my natural cleaning products.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and YL.  Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Tastes great in my water. This is huge considering I don&#x27;t like lemons added to my water. I bought an amber bottle to keep some with me. I don&#x27;t drink my water without it. I haven&#x27;t experimented with other uses.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment best material at all cheap price thanks hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> my fiancee and I have always been a big fan of the lemon sent, just the right amount of scent</li>
    <li> This smell is unbelievable! I sleep so good under my window at night after I spray a few times into the air or on my curtains. The wind blows in and the lemon smell hits my face and nose and I feel at peace. It&#x27;s amazing how the smell of fresh lemons can calm you and make you feel so at peace. I love it! Oh in case some of you are interested, I originally bought the lemon oil to get rid of spiders that come in from outside. I sprayed a few times around the edge of the window sill and around the inside of the screen and presto! no more spiders. I found out about it from this lady on HGTV her show is called Lush House. She is really good at taking natural products and cleaning a home.  Happy cleaning!</li>
    <li> I have purchased smaller bottles of essential oils from this company before and have been pleased with what I received. When I first got this bottle I opened it to make sure that the dropper was in place, which it was, and then I put the lid back on. When I opened it the second time and turned it over to add a few drops to a batch of body butter a quarter of the contents spilled into the batch. The dropper was lodged in the cap and of course that batch was ruined. Needless to say I am very unhappy...</li>
    <li> I used it to get rid of fleas and i t got rid of them in one day. I used it in my homemade laundry detergent and it smells just as good as my house does from getting rid of fleas.</li>
    <li> Best aroma of all the essential oils!&lt;br /&gt;A favorite in the office!</li>
    <li> Great Price, Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I put this in my DIY toothpaste and it is great.</li>
    <li> Excellent smelling product. I use a small dash for everything...cleaning my floor, dishes, laundry AND a small amount in a spray bottle with a little water to spray on my carpets. My house smells wonderfully and my cat, determined to pee on my rugs, HATES the smell. She is now retrained to use her kitty box since I spray it everywhere...on my wood floors, chairs, rugs, chair pads....no one knows why...they just love my house smelling so wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought an essential oil of this brand, but I decided to because of the price. I guess you get what you pay for. There&#x27;s no dropper to dispense it, but I had one to use...tried it out in my diffuser and I can&#x27;t smell a thing. Very weak. I used 5 drops of the brand I usually get, and the whole room would smell amazing. 10 drops of this, and I smell nothing. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> An oil is impossible to find, here at the end of Cape Cod, and I am happy to have it.  thanks.</li>
    <li> Good Product and Fast Shipping!!</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t get enough. I use this in cleaning, and mixed with essential oils of orange, cedarwood, and patchouli as a very, VERY nice personal scent (trust me, patchouli naysayers! The citrus is KEY!)</li>
    <li> Awesome product, used so much for cleaning, as bug repellent, and diffusing make a basement smell like a citrus grove, now on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I purchased this locally, on sale. It seems like good lemon oil, though it is the only lemon oil I&#x27;ve smelled before. Sweeter than I expected.For a moment, I expected a company with the word, &#x27;foods&#x27; in the name to sell only food safe products. Kind of funny in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This oil is great. Works as I wanted it to. I make my own cleaners, and this smells so good.</li>
    <li> Top quality!  Great price!  As good as their overprices competitors!</li>
    <li> Its ok, but not strong enough for a diffuser.  I would suggest for drinking water only.  Its not my fav out of all that I bought.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this friend of essential oils, shipped very quickly thank you</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a reasonable price!  I use this in my diffuser and DIY cleaners and laundry detergent.  It is just as good as the overpriced oils you can get from other companies if you have money to burn.</li>
    <li> this is lemon oil.  I like the smell of lemon oil.  Nine more words to go, now three.  Only two!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like how easy it is to use more than you intend do to the way to opening of the bottle is but it smells great and the price is good.</li>
    <li> This oil had a stronger odor than I expected.  I expected it to be more on the light side, but to me, it is a bit on the heavy side.  However, I used it in my office which is rather small.  Maybe it would be better in a larger room.so the odor can disperse more.</li>
    <li> Bottle is huge I will never run out of this stuff. I use it to flavor H2O and P0T.</li>
    <li> I use this when I make fluid to clean my Braun shaver.  A bit of rubbing alcohol and this. This is nice because it includes the lemon scent, a little bit acidic for cleaning and the oil to lubricate the shaver.</li>
    <li> I Thought from now foods, this would be something to ingest. But I will just be using it in my cleaning products.</li>
    <li> This product arrived promptly, and is exactly as expected. The only problem, and I consider it a SMALL problem, is that it leaked slightly. The cap was not closed tightly, and I know it is very difficult to keep oil from leaking. I would say that there was about 1/2 oz. loss of product. It was individually packeaged in bubble wrap, so the product leakage did not spread to other products in the box. All in all, I have no complaint.</li>
    <li> I can buy this locally without shipping.  I will do that next time.  Not as good as other products I have used, but it was ok.</li>
    <li> I like the clean fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My room freshening method:&lt;br /&gt;Thoroughly clean tile floors. Allow to dry.&lt;br /&gt;With a clean damp pour 1 tablespoons lemon oil + 1 cup water, damp mop tile floors.  Very nice room freshener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product, it has many uses.</li>
    <li> I love aromatherapy and used to buy essential oils from a particular distributor who has of late, I suspect, been diffusing the purity of their essential oils. I could just smell the lower quality. But Now Foods essential oil truly smells 100% pure. They are not too sweet, nor too bland. I feel that it smells as if the fresh lemon has just been squeezed. This applies to all the other Now Foods oils that I bought - lavender, orange, peppermint, eucalyptus, etc. I&#x27;m very happy with the high quality and with the great value for money of this product.</li>
    <li> This product has the best quality oil aroma, it has a very good price also, I have tried a lot of brands and I really recommend this one.</li>
    <li> with a few drops of this it smells like the house has just been cleaned. the more drops the higher the scent</li>
    <li> During pregnancy, I suddenly got some small warts on my hands. I tried the OTC wart removers after my doctor OK&#x27;ed it, but it only made them worse. I did some reading and learned of some folks who had success using lemon essential oil. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to buy this and try it out.  If it didn&#x27;t work, there are plenty of other household uses for lemon essential oil so it wouldn&#x27;t be a waste. I added a few drops of lemon oil with coconut oil and rubbed it into my hands like any other moisturizer every morning/night for 1 week. I started noticing a slight difference in the warts decreasing in size, and to my delight, after 2 weeks they were completely gone!  Easy and all-natural wart remover!</li>
    <li> I use this for a handmade bath detergent. Smells great after I clean the bath room! I love it!</li>
    <li> I use Now essential oils to make cold processed soaps. I have been very happy with all my oils from Now. They smell pretty much the same as essential oils from the more expensive companies. I will continue purchasing Now essential oils for my soaps in the future. I have been happy with the purity, consistency, and fragrance of their essential oils. The lemon essential oil has a great lemon fragrance. I also put a few drops of this lemon oil in my water bottles to give plain tap water a slight citrus flavor. Additionally, I use the lemon essential oil in a home diffuser, and it smells delightful!</li>
    <li> for everyone that is not happy with the cap i would recommend using a insulin syringe and you can just&lt;br /&gt;get very small amounts that you want without any loss at all..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bingo.... !!!  that fixes the problem..  of course i am a NURSE so i always find ways to use syringes, small ones, big ones etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i cant wait to use mine, i plan on using it for so many things, lemon snaps, lemon drink/ water, lemon scented skin oil.. etc..&lt;br /&gt;cant get enough lemon..&lt;br /&gt;i have my diffuser packed, but i really think a burner is better because the diffuser is too loud to me..</li>
    <li> NOW foods always reliable oils</li>
    <li> I used it to mix with baking soda and vinegar for laundry detergent and it made our clothes smell great and I think it actually helped bring back the color in some of my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always heard you should dilute essential oil before using it on your face, I mixed about 50/50 morrocan argon oil and lemon oil for my face and it burned! So if your use it on your skin, keep in mind a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The scent is fairly light unless you use a lot and it doesn&#x27;t last overly long.</li>
    <li> This might seem silly, but I spill sometimes just as much as I get into my diffuser (I use the oil in a diffuser because supposedly it helps with concentration). Despite being very careful, and trying to pour the oil different ways, I find that I&#x27;m spilling a lot of the oil. I want to point out, that I&#x27;ve had Now&#x27;s 16 oz bottles as well for Eucalyptus and Peppermint oil, and they pour perfectly fine...so I have to say, looks like really bad product design.</li>
    <li> I did not buy the dropper because some reviews said it came with a dropper top..mine is stuck in the lid..so now I have to pour the oil or buy a dropper..not happy with this!</li>
    <li> This fragrance oil smells great and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and intact. Smells great. Works great. So glad to have gotten this &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; bottle. I use lemon essential oil in nearly all my household items that I make, especially dish soap. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the product. I did read reviews after purchasing about the dropper lid, I didn&#x27;t even notice it there or think about it, honestly. I openened the bottle and grabbed a dropper of my own without even thinking about it. If you don&#x27;t have glass droppers on hand, you can buy cheap little plastic ones to reuse.</li>
    <li> It is excellent. I got it for use in Laundry. For internal use, I prefer doTerra. But for a really strong lemon scent, and anti-bacterial abilities . . . it is really good. If I coulnd&#x27;t afford doTerra, I&#x27;d use this in a heartbeat. I mainly use a drop on toothepaste to brush teeth. Makes them whiter, and makes my gums super healthy.</li>
    <li> I have only used this item once, so my review is based solely on the fact that a 4oz bottle does NOT have a dropper!  What a disappointment!  Thank goodness I had a pipette handy or I know for sure I would have wasted a ton trying to use it!</li>
    <li> This is some of the highest quality, most aromatic lemon essential oil I have found so far.  I use it with rubbing alcohol to make cleaning liquid to refill my electric razor Clean &amp; Renew cartridges. It has no eyedropper in the cap so to measure I use Transfer Pipettes sold here on Amazon for under $5 / pack of 100 ( 3ml. size, 1ml. &#x3D; 20 drops ).</li>
    <li> I just received my oil and:&lt;br /&gt;1) the seal was broken&lt;br /&gt;2) the oil does not smell as strong as other lemon essential oils I have used before.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if mine was diluted, as the seal was opened anything is possible and I won&#x27;t buy it again. As I got it on the subscribe and save, it seems that the only thing I can do is not buy it again instead of returning as I would like.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand of oils!</li>
    <li> Although, it does not come with a dropper (as shown in the picture) or good way to get only a little bit out (a thing in the cap, only allowing a little bit to go through).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B/c of that, I poured a bunch out into my glass of water, instead of individual drops. Not that much, barely went down in the jar. However poured the top of a pint jar (used as my glass) about 1/3, it spread out to 3/4 full of lemon essential oil on top of water. Will not take any of this oil for at least a couple of weeks or months, b/c I took such a great amount all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not notice any feeling of &amp;#34;happy thoughts&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;psychedelic effects&amp;#34; after drinking it, as some people on the internet had said (30-60 drops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am not a holistic healer or anything like that. Have read in many internet sites that you should not take essential oils internally. However, I did not notice any allergic reactions, from taking so much internally, but this is for me &amp; everyone&#x27;s body does not always react the same. Nevertheless, I would do great research on taking essential oils internally &amp; externally. B/c I have read that taking Lavender Essential Oil &amp;#34;can&amp;#34; cause miscarriages. Any essential oil is also greatly concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use caution unless you&#x27;re well versed in essential oils.</li>
    <li> I ordered the large size bottle because I use a lot of lemon oil. The product is fine but I am disappointed in the fact that the stopper/dropper on the mouth of the bottle was not attached and so now I have to pour from the bottle and it is difficult to judge the amount I am using.</li>
    <li> Ok,&lt;br /&gt;I love NOW products but I dropped a star because there&#x27;s no dropper included to measure. Measuring is EXTREMELY important! It&#x27;s easy to \\&quot;burn\\&quot; yourself with essential oil of lemon.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great stuff. It&#x27;s anti fungal, anti microbial and anti bacterial. It&#x27;s great for calming nerves, uplifting your mood and relieving headaches. Good for cleaning, adding to soap, etc. smells great! Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;Buy a dropper and dilute well! :-)</li>
    <li> Lemon oil has got to be my very favorite essential oil. I use it in my laundry, in the bath tub, in my diffuser, in cleaning solutions, the list goes on and on and on. I have a very limited budget so I must say that if I can only have one essential oil in my home this would definitely be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is good quality. It isn&#x27;t the strongest I have smelled but it is, by far, the very best value. You do need a dropper with this bottle but you can fix that problem easily. They are carried here on Amazon and the plastic ones come in packs of several and they do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely no complaints about this product. I highly recommend it to all consumers.</li>
    <li> Love these essential oils.</li>
    <li> Natural and without harmful chemicals, I am loving my lemon oil essential oil. I am yet to invest in a good diffuser for my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great quality, I use this for making up Four Thieves cleaning solutions, it works well!</li>
    <li> Love to stock up on lemon oil for cleaning, diffusing to disinfect air, and make my own hand sanitizer.  Product is top notch.</li>
    <li> junk you should only buy therapeuticgrade oil</li>
    <li> This scented oil does the trick.  A little drop or two will do ya&#x27;, since it&#x27;s very concentrated.  Goes well with epsom salts in baths.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Would be nice if the bottle had a dropper though</li>
</ol>
