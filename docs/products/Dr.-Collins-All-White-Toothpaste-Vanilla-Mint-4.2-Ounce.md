      <li>It&#x27;s a vanilla mint and works great!</li>
      <li>It was the perfect blend of mint and sweetness.</li>
      <li>This tooth paste in the BEST!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent taste!!!!</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is great!!!</li>
      <li>Again great product I will buy again and recommend to others.</li>
      <li>This stuff works great.</li>
      <li>Very Good, nice try, will try again.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is always good.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
      <li>Also, forget the baking soda taste, this toothpaste tastes so good</li>
      <li>It works great but the mint is &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; - most toothpastes irritate my mouth.</li>
      <li>Exceptional toothpaste that works effectively to protect teeth without damaging them.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>The best toothpaste, my whole family loves it.</li>
      <li>Tastes great and is very gentle on your mouth.</li>
      <li>This is very mild and does a nice job.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite toothpaste of all time.</li>
      <li>Love this product for taste and whitening power.</li>
      <li>Glad I found it at Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the type that has my teeth whitened 2 times per year &amp; love visiting the dentist for my bi-monthly cleaning.  </li>
      <li>I will say, that it tastes better than pastes that I&#x27;ve tried geared toward toddlers.  </li>
      <li>In contrast, the vanilla of Dr. Collins is soothing and tastes great, and the whitening really works-there&#x27;s a noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Well, okay,</li>
      <li>I will use it more often to give a better review, but so far, it&#x27;s just a good toothpaste.</li>
      <li>With so many SLS-free toothpastes available, why would anyone choose to purchase this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great at maintaining the white, and doesn&#x27;t leave the burn in your mouth that so many toothpastes do.  </li>
      <li>I love this brand of toothpaste, it really cleans and whitens, plus the taste is really nice, not over powering.</li>
      <li>FEELING CLEAN,</li>
      <li>but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, clean teeth.  </li>
      <li>It makes my mouth taste like clean vanilla.</li>
      <li>YOUR MOUTH STILL FEELS CLEAN - WITHOUT ANY PASTY FEELING.</li>
      <li>The vanilla mint is different, but pleasant.  </li>
      <li>None of my children liked minty toothpaste but they were getting too old for the bubble gum flavored variety.  </li>
      <li>(I was worried it would be too sweet, but it&#x27;s not.)  </li>
      <li>This is a nice effective toothpaste with fluoride and it has a mild, slightly vanilla-mint flavor.</li>
      <li>Somehow I missed it online, but, luckily, I saw it listed on the sample toothpaste I received.</li>
      <li>His teeth are noticeably whiter and he loves the mild flavor.</li>
      <li>Great taste; leaves my teeth smooth and slick.  </li>
      <li>I love the taste, and it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth feel overly sensitive.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so rare that you find a product that does what it says.  </li>
      <li>Overall a good product and decent size for the cost.</li>
      <li>right away.\\&quot; Poison control?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found my new favorite toothpaste, easily replaces Colgate Total.</li>
      <li>Gentle whitening toothpaste with mild taste.</li>
      <li>it not by original plan, thanks so much.</li>
      <li>I do believe I see a positive difference.</li>
      <li>but, I actually have sat there and brushed my teeth for 10 minutes without realizing because it&#x27;s sooooo smooth &amp; refreshing on the gums.  </li>
      <li>If more than is used for brushing ( a pea sized amount... and most use 4 times+ that) is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center</li>
      <li>I not only received this very quickly, and have been using it since I got it.</li>
      <li>No dramatic results but will see gradual results with continued use.</li>
      <li>Certainly this &#x27;doctor&#x27; must have known about SLS or perhaps he was not informed.  </li>
      <li>but it really works.</li>
      <li>I like that it has (body) consistency and is not runny out of the tube like many other toothpastes.</li>
      <li>I can be foundin most household products such as floor wax, car cleaners, laundry detergent, shampoo, and especially, TOOTHPASTE!!  </li>
      <li>It is also a main cause of canker sores in the mouth.  </li>
      <li>All White Toothpaste not only has a nice taste but provides extra fluoride that reduces sensitivity to teeth and gums.  </li>
      <li>This product was the only one they were willing to switch to.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t take right, and with the no-effect side to it, it&#x27;s absolutely not any better than my usual Colgate Triple Action toothpaste.</li>
      <li>When it arrived I read the label and it clearly states that it contains toxic Sodium Fluoride as well as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and Dr. Collins</li>
      <li>This toothpaste produces no discomfort on my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Tastes good, cleans extremely well and perks up your smile without discomfort, heavy abrasion or harsh taste.</li>
      <li>Buying the 3-pack saves time and money - especially for us New Yorkers that don&#x27;t often have time to seek these products out.</li>
      <li>This is a major plus.</li>

<li> and my teeth have whitened and become less sensitive to pain.</li>
<li> Yes, many would think I&#x27;m crazy, but I take pride in oral hygiene.  </li>
<li> unlike every other whitening toothpaste, this one actually works!</li>
<li> I like this toothpaste because it is different than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> I have a very senstivie tongue, and when many toothpastes touch it, it can be very painful.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t imagine using any other toothpaste.</li>
<li> Been using it religiously for the past 2-3 months, and no effects whatsoever.</li>
<li> A common ingredient in personal care products, sodium lauryl sulfate, or SLS, is an additive that allows cleansing products to foam.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s always, &#x27;no mommy, the black one&#x27;.  </li>
<li> I hate minty, or strong toothpastes.</li>
<li> BUYING THIS TOOTHPASTE WAS A WASTE OF MONEY;  I WILL STAY WITH AMWAY GLISTER TOOTHPASTE.  </li>
<li> I was not able to see any whitening of my teeth after using this product.  </li>
<li> I like the flavor of this toothpaste, but not sure about the whitening effects as of yet.  </li>
<li> Hard to find vanilla flavored toothpaste.  </li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t bad, not too minty for me, but I would definitely like something sweeter.</li>
<li> I find it appalling that a &#x27;doctor&#x27; has his name associated with this product and, yet, allowed SLS to be added to his toothpaste.  </li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t like whitening toothpaste - it leaves a weird taste in my mouth.  </li>
<li> Flavor is very subtle.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m also a smoker, so to have pearly whites makes it a bit difficult.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed that this company even sells this crap...</li>
<li> I was very disappointed Crest stopped making their vanilla mint toothpaste.</li>

    <li> BUYING THIS TOOTHPASTE WAS A WASTE OF MONEY;  I WILL STAY WITH AMWAY GLISTER TOOTHPASTE.  AMWAY GLISTER TOOTHPASTE LEAVES YOUR MOUTH FEELING CLEAN, JUST LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE A CLEANING AT THE DENTIST AND IN THE MORNING YOUR MOUTH STILL FEELS CLEAN - WITHOUT ANY PASTY FEELING.</li>
    <li> Very Good, nice try, will try again.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is always good.&lt;br /&gt;Got it not by original plan, thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Excellent taste!!!! The vanilla mint has the flavor of angel food cake with a dash of mint. Makes you want to keep brushing for hours. Compared to the Colgate Optic White this is a stronger whitener but around the same level as some of the Crest whitening pastes. No dramatic results but will see gradual results with continued use. Overall a good product and decent size for the cost. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste in the BEST!!! unlike every other whitening toothpaste, this one actually works! You can see a difference even after a couple uses!!! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed Crest stopped making their vanilla mint toothpaste. It was the perfect blend of mint and sweetness. I tried this as a replacement. It isn&#x27;t bad, not too minty for me, but I would definitely like something sweeter.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great!!! Tastes good, cleans extremely well and perks up your smile without discomfort, heavy abrasion or harsh taste. Buying the 3-pack saves time and money - especially for us New Yorkers that don&#x27;t often have time to seek these products out. I would recommend to anyone!!</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste, my whole family loves it. It&#x27;s a vanilla mint and works great!</li>
    <li> The only toothpaste I buy now. It works great but the mint is &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; - most toothpastes irritate my mouth. Love it!</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste I have found.  Been using  for years.  Flavor is very subtle.  Non abrasive so no worry about hurting the enamel.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this after trying Dr. Collins Restore toothpaste. I like the taste of this toothpaste, but I did not notice any whitening. Whereas when I used the Restore toothpaste, I noticed tooth enamel improvement and whitening.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste of all time. I have a very senstivie tongue, and when many toothpastes touch it, it can be very painful. In contrast, the vanilla of Dr. Collins is soothing and tastes great, and the whitening really works-there&#x27;s a noticeable difference. I keep buying Dr Collins myself,and I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t wowed over with this but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, clean teeth.  My young toddler enjoys it and gets irritated with mommy when I attempt to use any other paste on the brush.  It&#x27;s always, &#x27;no mommy, the black one&#x27;.  I will say, that it tastes better than pastes that I&#x27;ve tried geared toward toddlers.  I use this from time to time as well.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of toothpaste, it really cleans and whitens, plus the taste is really nice, not over powering.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this toothpaste. His teeth are noticeably whiter and he loves the mild flavor. We order this on Subscribe &amp; Save so we always have enough on hand.</li>
    <li> Makes your teeth feel like they have just been cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s. Tastes great and is very gentle on your mouth. I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Great taste; leaves my teeth smooth and slick.  This toothpaste produces no discomfort on my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> I was not able to see any whitening of my teeth after using this product.  I also discovered that it contains glycerin, hydrated silica and sodium lauryl sulfate--ingredients I prefer not to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the \\&quot;restore\\&quot; toothpaste for about a year now.... I&#x27;m 61 and my teeth have whitened and become less sensitive to pain. I bought it initially because it didn&#x27;t have fluoride. This product has it. And... they put this disclaimer on it- \\&quot;Safety Information&lt;br /&gt;Keep out of reach of children 2 years of age. If more than is used for brushing ( a pea sized amount... and most use 4 times+ that) is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away.\\&quot; Poison control? Get the hint. I&#x27;m disappointed that this company even sells this crap...</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like whitening toothpaste - it leaves a weird taste in my mouth.  This product is mild and the vanilla flavor is subtle.  (I was worried it would be too sweet, but it&#x27;s not.)  It&#x27;s a great transition toothpaste for kids!  None of my children liked minty toothpaste but they were getting too old for the bubble gum flavored variety.  This product was the only one they were willing to switch to.</li>
    <li> I know I just got this product but it really works. It&#x27;s so rare that you find a product that does what it says.  Again great product I will buy again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste because it is different than any other I&#x27;ve tried. It makes my mouth taste like clean vanilla.</li>
    <li> Exceptional toothpaste that works effectively to protect teeth without damaging them.</li>
    <li> At the time of my purchase and the writing of this review, the ingredients list in the product description says that this product does not contain sodium fluoride. When it arrived I read the label and it clearly states that it contains toxic Sodium Fluoride as well as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.</li>
    <li> I like the flavor of this toothpaste, but not sure about the whitening effects as of yet.  I don&#x27;t use this every day, which may have something to do with it.  I will use it more often to give a better review, but so far, it&#x27;s just a good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Been using it religiously for the past 2-3 months, and no effects whatsoever. I probably will not buy it again. Didn&#x27;t take right, and with the no-effect side to it, it&#x27;s absolutely not any better than my usual Colgate Triple Action toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Hard to find vanilla flavored toothpaste.  I love the taste, and it doesn&#x27;t make my teeth feel overly sensitive.  This is a major plus.</li>
    <li> The vanilla mint is different, but pleasant.  It doesn&#x27;t hit you over the head with a BAM! of flavor.  All-in-all, it seems to be doing what you want in a flouride toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I not only received this very quickly, and have been using it since I got it. I do believe I see a positive difference.</li>
    <li> Love this product for taste and whitening power. I can&#x27;t imagine using any other toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste contains SLS or SODIUM LAURYL SULFATE. This is toxic additive that makes products foam.  It I can be foundin most household products such as floor wax, car cleaners, laundry detergent, shampoo, and especially, TOOTHPASTE!!  I find it appalling that a &#x27;doctor&#x27; has his name associated with this product and, yet, allowed SLS to be added to his toothpaste.  Certainly this &#x27;doctor&#x27; must have known about SLS or perhaps he was not informed.  A common ingredient in personal care products, sodium lauryl sulfate, or SLS, is an additive that allows cleansing products to foam. According to the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Database, SLS is a &amp;#34;moderate hazard&amp;#34; that has been linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, organ toxicity, skin irritation and endocrine disruption. It is also a main cause of canker sores in the mouth.  Yuck!!  With so many SLS-free toothpastes available, why would anyone choose to purchase this product.  I would not have bought it if I had seen the SLS ingredient listed.  Somehow I missed it online, but, luckily, I saw it listed on the sample toothpaste I received.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has replaced the prescription one that my dentist had me use for years.  I have sensitive teeth and Dr. Collins All White Toothpaste not only has a nice taste but provides extra fluoride that reduces sensitivity to teeth and gums.  Glad I found it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve switched to this toothpaste (vanilla) because of our dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  I&#x27;m the type that has my teeth whitened 2 times per year &amp; love visiting the dentist for my bi-monthly cleaning.  Yes, many would think I&#x27;m crazy, but I take pride in oral hygiene.  I&#x27;m also a smoker, so to have pearly whites makes it a bit difficult.  Not with this toothpaste, however.  It&#x27;s great at maintaining the white, and doesn&#x27;t leave the burn in your mouth that so many toothpastes do.  Also, forget the baking soda taste, this toothpaste tastes so good, I can sit there and brush my teeth for hours.  Well, okay, minutes....but, I actually have sat there and brushed my teeth for 10 minutes without realizing because it&#x27;s sooooo smooth &amp; refreshing on the gums.  For the price, and the size of the tube, even the dollar store can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Gentle whitening toothpaste with mild taste. I hate minty, or strong toothpastes. This is very mild and does a nice job. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I purchased a tube of Dr. Collins Restore and a trial size tube of this was included. I&#x27;ve been using both together and my teeth are already whiter after three uses! I like using both together because this has fluoride and Restore doesn&#x27;t but decreases sensitivity. I&#x27;ve found my new favorite toothpaste, easily replaces Colgate Total.</li>
