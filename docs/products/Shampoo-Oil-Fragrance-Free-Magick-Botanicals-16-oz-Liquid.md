### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is an excellent product that exceeded my expectations and was delivered on time.</li>
      <li>This is the best on the market in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Magick is the best around.  </li>
      <li>Best used with the Magick Botanicals oil-free hair conditioner.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo!</li>
      <li>Perfect for hcg phase 2, I used the shampoo and conditioner,  they both work just great</li>
      <li>which was great for awhile.  </li>
      <li>This product works great.  </li>
      <li>For me, this approach works great since I have to do two sudsings anyway.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for no oil product and came very quickly.</li>
      <li>You do need to use a lot of it to get a good lather.  </li>
      <li>SUPERIOR  </li>
      <li>Incidentally: I ordered Stonybrook Botanicals fragrance and oil free shampoo and OMG !!  </li>
      <li>Love that it has no smell at all!  </li>
      <li>It smells nice</li>
      <li>Good shampoo and is fragrance free but does not lather up like you would expect from a shampoo</li>
      <li>It gives a good lather and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Makes me have to use more than I should.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>therefore I feel the need to use more of it.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>and it really does a great job cleaning my hair and my hair</li>
      <li>All in all, I love it.</li>
      <li>Also I find it lathers better if I lather, rinse, and repeat.</li>
      <li>I am glad to have found them.  </li>
      <li>then that, i love it.</li>
      <li>There was so many fragrances and herbs (probably in the manufacturing facility?)</li>
      <li>Of all of the fragrance free shampoos I have tried, this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>Love it love it , yes expansive but if you are allergic to fragrance this is a product you should buy.</li>
      <li>&quot; this product is mostly water.  </li>
      <li>I love it and would recommend it to anyone needing a break from the chemicals.</li>
      <li>I am one of those people who have allergies to many things including fragrance and chemicals.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need lather to be satisfied.</li>
      <li>So what I do is use another shampoo that I can mostly tolerate (but will cause some skin problems if I use it alone).</li>
      <li>, I straighten my wavy hair, was worried that I might end up frizzy if no oils in the products, but it was all just fine, not luxurious, but they do the job and work much better for me than baking soda wash and vinegar rinse when in phase 2.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m fine that I have to use more and don&#x27;t have as foamy of an effect with this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>like the conditioner, I wish they make a product for heat protectant more importantly a frizz control treatment.</li>
      <li>It is a natural product and leaves your hair in great condition.</li>
      <li>&amp; it really looks good.  </li>
      <li>It does a good job, but I have to use SOO much of it at one time.</li>
      <li>A lot of times I will have to shampoo twice to make sure my hair gets all the way clean.</li>
      <li>With longer hair you would have to use most of the bottle in order to feel clean.</li>
      <li>My hair lathered fine and in fact I found that just leaving it there for a minute or so after scrubbing, it seemed to be foaming up.</li>
      <li>I have medium length curly \ wavy fine hair.</li>
      <li>is super healthy.</li>
      <li>Truly scent free and gentle, but effective.</li>
      <li>that they tried to protect the fragrance free container (I assume) RETURNED  the Stonybrook.....</li>
      <li>I had been using \\&quot;Free and Clear,\\&quot;</li>
      <li>and it was \\&quot;fragrance free and oil free\\</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a fragrance free, oil free shampoo.</li>
      <li>I bought it because I did the HCG diet which required the oil free products.  </li>
      <li>This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve been able to use in my almost 50 years that didn&#x27;t make my head explode with sores and itchy scaliness.  </li>
      <li>If you work it well into the hair it will clean it well regardless.  </li>
      <li>your hair seems to stay clean longer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell flowery after I wash it, I just want it to be clean.</li>
      <li>My hair is now shiny, clean looking and manageable.  </li>
      <li>But nah, you do not have to use alot of the bottle to get your hair clean.  </li>
      <li>It is an excellent bargain that was well worth the money spent and recommended to anyone interested.</li>
      <li>True to the title \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; and \\&quot;oil free\\</li>
      <li>It is true</li>
      <li>It is oil free and fragrance free, it is very watery</li>
      <li>Takes a bit more shampoo than the high-quality ones, but leave hair clean but not dried out.</li>
      <li>The only downside is the price, which is way more than store-bought shampoos; however, I guess that&#x27;s the price you pay for being fragrance sensitive/allergic to fragrances in a society where people want to be drenched in perfume from head to toe!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to a different fragrance free / oil free shampoo that is available at a local store (it&#x27;s cheaper and just as effective).</li>
      <li>Even though this is fragrance free, it is very runny and water-like.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try if you have allergies.</li>
      <li>and was surprised that i really love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>so I also wash it twice, but the results are well worth it.  </li>
      <li>But the trade off is well worth it to not be choking on fragrances</li>
      <li>I have used it, and recommended it, for years now (originally had to buy it online prior to being available through Amazon)  </li>
      <li>I ordered because of going on the HCG diet, and I am satisfied with this product for that short term use.</li>
      <li>People do not realize that all the combine smell just makes you stink does not smell pretty.  </li>
      <li>Another fragrance free product for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>My list of safe shampoos is very short.  </li>
      <li>Lathered up pretty well until I got my summer buzz cut.  </li>
      <li>Since it is fragrance free she adds a few drops of Sweet Orange essential oils to create her own fragrance.</li>
      <li>Magick Botanicals requires a ton of product to achieve a barely satisfactory lather; however, their conditioner is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It IS very low sudsing which makes me feel like a need to use more than the normal amount.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not thick but rather thin liquid, and I also need to use a little more to cover my head, but it&#x27;s so wonderful to have something scent-free that I scarcely care about that.  </li>
      <li>if I really need to use so much, or if I just have to get used to the lack of lather.  </li>
      <li>Does the job in the shower and priced reasonable.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I used to get it in Whole Foods</li>
      <li>I really wish the shampoo was thicker.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for gentle, non-irritating cleansing, this is the product for you.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle, not watery in my opinion and actually got my hair squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as frequently which is great because I have 4c curls and needed less stress on my scalp/hair as much as possible</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, you do have to use more of this shampoo than you would the average shampoo because it is more watery.  </li>
      <li>We&#x27;re highly allergic to fragrances and this has absolutely none.</li>
      <li>It is a bit drying but not nearly as bad as similar products.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very watery so that it&#x27;s kind of hard to work up a lather.  </li>
      <li>Water based is less toxic, and yes you use a bit more to get a lather that you are used.</li>
      <li>I also tried Free and Clear, which left my hair feeling overly stripped.  </li>
      <li>It lathers pretty well, requiring a lot more shampoo than I expected it would to get enough lather for my hair, and the rest of me.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re stuck buying through Amazon, I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Had to find a fragrance-free shampoo because I realized my scalp is ultra sensitive and gets funky fast with anything that has a fragrance.</li>
      <li>Save your money dilute any shampoo by 100 with water and you will be better off and save a few dollars.</li>
      <li>After rinsing that out really well, I use this one to essentially rinse out all the residue from the first shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Live and learn.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Truly scent free and gentle, but effective.</li>
    <li> I tried this for an odd reason, diet plan suggested limiting oils from cosmetic items - not sure that i believe that part - but i decided to try it. and was surprised that i really love this shampoo.  It does not lather but that&#x27;s ok.  My hair seems to stay cleaner longer.  &amp; it really looks good.  Diet or not, I would use it again.</li>
    <li> I have multiple contact allergies.  My list of safe shampoos is very short.  I had been using \\&quot;Free and Clear,\\&quot; which was great for awhile.  Lately, my hair seemed very lifeless except for static.  I tried Magick.  My hair is now shiny, clean looking and manageable.  It IS very low sudsing which makes me feel like a need to use more than the normal amount.  I&#x27;m not sure yet if I really need to use so much, or if I just have to get used to the lack of lather.  Definitely worth a try if you have allergies.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I bought it because I did the HCG diet which required the oil free products.  I would use it anytime...your hair seems to stay clean longer.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  It has not fragrance which i am allergy too.  I can not see how one can wear shampoo that smell the body splash, them perfume , makeup and their clothes washed in smell stuff.  People do not realize that all the combine smell just makes you stink does not smell pretty.  pick one smell and stick with it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a fragrance free, oil free shampoo. This will do. It lathers pretty well, requiring a lot more shampoo than I expected it would to get enough lather for my hair, and the rest of me. I ordered because of going on the HCG diet, and I am satisfied with this product for that short term use. I gave it 3 stars because I think &amp;#34;Magick Botanicals&amp;#34; should have in its list of ingredients at least one recognizable botanical. Instead of botanicals, there is a list of  multisyllabic chemicals, including methylparaben and Propylparaben. These parabens are NOT listed on the website. While common in cosmetics, these chemicals are estrogen mimics and I question the safety of them, especially for long term use. Live and learn. Don&#x27;t go for the name. Read your labels!</li>
    <li> Lathered up pretty well until I got my summer buzz cut.  Seems to do the job, itchy scalp disappeared after about a week.</li>
    <li> With an allergy to fragrances, even herbal and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ones, it is very difficult to find a shampoo.  Even though this is fragrance free, it is very runny and water-like. With longer hair you would have to use most of the bottle in order to feel clean.</li>
    <li> I have finally found a hair product that is truly unscented!  I have found so many that say &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fragrance-free&amp;#34; that are absolutely not, but this one definitely is.  It is true it&#x27;s not thick but rather thin liquid, and I also need to use a little more to cover my head, but it&#x27;s so wonderful to have something scent-free that I scarcely care about that.  The only downside is the price, which is way more than store-bought shampoos; however, I guess that&#x27;s the price you pay for being fragrance sensitive/allergic to fragrances in a society where people want to be drenched in perfume from head to toe!</li>
    <li> If you have a lot of allergies and sensitivities, this is one of the few shampoos out there that really IS hypoallergenic, and it works rather well.</li>
    <li> I have MULTIPLE  CHEMICAL  SENSITIVITY  and even small amounts of fragrance wipe me out.  I have used this brand (including conditioner, lotion, etc) for years. It truly does not have a fragrance smell. Yes, it is a bit watery (the shampoo only) as was a complaint made, I see. But nah, you do not have to use alot of the bottle to get your hair clean.  Water based is less toxic, and yes you use a bit more to get a lather that you are used. But the trade off is well worth it to not be choking on fragrances and it really does a great job cleaning my hair and my hair is super healthy. I have used it, and recommended it, for years now (originally had to buy it online prior to being available through Amazon)  SUPERIOR  PRODUCT !  This is the best on the market in my opinion. Incidentally: I ordered Stonybrook Botanicals fragrance and oil free shampoo and OMG !!  the shampoo bottle was packed in plastic that gave me headache just opening the box.  There was so many fragrances and herbs (probably in the manufacturing facility?) that they tried to protect the fragrance free container (I assume) RETURNED  the Stonybrook.....beyond disgusting!!!  and it was \\&quot;fragrance free and oil free\\&quot;  trust me:  Magick is the best around.

    <li> True to the title \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; and \\&quot;oil free\\&quot; this product is mostly water.  It is very difficult to work up any lather.  Save your money dilute any shampoo by 100 with water and you will be better off and save a few dollars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews here that say the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather well.  That is because it is missing the chemicals that cause lather.  Just because it doesn&#x27;t lather doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not cleaning your hair.  This is the first shampoo I&#x27;ve been able to use in my almost 50 years that didn&#x27;t make my head explode with sores and itchy scaliness.  If you&#x27;re looking for lather, go find chemical-laden shampoo.  If you&#x27;re looking for gentle, non-irritating cleansing, this is the product for you.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and haven&#x27;t had a breakout in that entire time.  I will keep using it.  I don&#x27;t need lather to be satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who have allergies to many things including fragrance and chemicals.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I&#x27;ve stepped out of the shower without hives all over my neck, chest and shoulders.  Maybe 10 years ?  This shampoo is such a relief.  It is gentle, not watery in my opinion and actually got my hair squeaky clean. I have medium length curly \ wavy fine hair. My hair lathered fine and in fact I found that just leaving it there for a minute or so after scrubbing, it seemed to be foaming up. I love it and would recommend it to anyone needing a break from the chemicals.</li>
    <li> Had to find a fragrance-free shampoo because I realized my scalp is ultra sensitive and gets funky fast with anything that has a fragrance. This shampoo was my savior! I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as frequently which is great because I have 4c curls and needed less stress on my scalp/hair as much as possible</li>
    <li> This shampoo works well.  Love that it has no smell at all!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a bit watered down.  I really wish the shampoo was thicker.  That would make it easier to use.  Since it is so runny, it tends to run off of my hands as I try to apply it to my scalp/hair.  Makes me have to use more than I should.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo everyday. Of all of the fragrance free shampoos I have tried, this is by far the best. It gives a good lather and leaves my hair feeling clean. It is a bit drying but not nearly as bad as similar products.</li>
    <li> It is an excellent product that exceeded my expectations and was delivered on time. It is an excellent bargain that was well worth the money spent and recommended to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> I have MCS and can&#x27;t use almost all shampoo&#x27;s.  I can use this one and I really like it.  When you use the shampoo it&#x27;s very watery so that it&#x27;s kind of hard to work up a lather.  other then that, i love it.</li>
    <li> I have severe fragrance allergies and in my search for products that wouldn&#x27;t make me sick I found these.  Yes, the shampoo is thin and does not lather well..that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical poisons in it that causes \\&quot;commercial\\&quot; shampoos to do so.  If you work it well into the hair it will clean it well regardless.  It is just not so that diluting \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo will give you the same results. It would still be full of countless chemicals that will cause a bad reaction in sensitive persons. You need to get over the idea that a shampoo has to lather like mad to clean...these products do the job and do not cause negative reactions, nor do they strip the hair of all its needed oils.   I am glad to have found them.  ~Mrs. W. James</li>
    <li> this shampoo is very gentle with no fragrance and few chemicals</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re highly allergic to fragrances and this has absolutely none. This shampoo is also gentle to dyed hair and can be used daily. Best used with the Magick Botanicals oil-free hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> Perfect for no oil product and came very quickly.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! I highly recommend it. I used to get it in Whole Foods but they stopped selling it.  But, it went to the wrong address so it took a while to get.</li>
    <li> Left my hair stripped and fragile</li>
    <li> The only shampoo we use in out house due to chemical sensitivities, particularly from salycilates.</li>
    <li> I started using Magick Botanicals Shampoo (and Conditioner) in 2006. I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell flowery after I wash it, I just want it to be clean. I&#x27;ve since switched to a different fragrance free / oil free shampoo that is available at a local store (it&#x27;s cheaper and just as effective). But if you&#x27;re stuck buying through Amazon, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to fragrances which cause allergic reactions. Good shampoo and is fragrance free but does not lather up like you would expect from a shampoo therefore I feel the need to use more of it.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is really runny and hard to lather, which is my biggest complaint. It did the job while I was on the hcG diet, though.</li>
    <li> I suffer from pretty severe acne, really bad on my back.  It was suggested to me that the fragrance in my shampoo could be partially to blame.  I hadn&#x27;t heard this before, even after spending years visiting dermatologists.  After using this product for a week my back was about 95% clear!  You do need to use a lot of it to get a good lather.  I have long hair so I also wash it twice, but the results are well worth it.  I recommend this for anyone suffering from \\&quot;bacne\\&quot; or anyone with skin sensitive to fragrance.</li>
    <li> Perfect for hcg phase 2, I used the shampoo and conditioner,  they both work just great, I straighten my wavy hair, was worried that I might end up frizzy if no oils in the products, but it was all just fine, not luxurious, but they do the job and work much better for me than baking soda wash and vinegar rinse when in phase 2.</li>
    <li> No smell but low suds.  I always have some on hand.</li>
    <li> Performs as described.</li>
    <li> I recently found out that I am allergic to propylene glycol so this shampoo was on the short list of products available to me.  Magick Botanicals requires a ton of product to achieve a barely satisfactory lather; however, their conditioner is fantastic.  I also tried Free and Clear, which left my hair feeling overly stripped.  I also tried VMV Hypoallergenics Essence Skin-Saving Superwash Hair and Body Milk Shampoo, which is very expensive; however, the lather is fantastic and the amount necessary to achieve it very small, making the price more reasonable.</li>
    <li> Very misleading listing, showing 3 bottles and in small print &amp;#34;1 of&amp;#34;.  Be careful folks, if you order this you will only get one; very expensive for a shampoo.  Even if it works as it claims I am turned off by what I consider having been misled.</li>
    <li> Other reviews said it was watery and hard to lather. I find just the opposite. It&#x27;s not quite a thick as other oily shampoos but not watery. Also I find it lathers better if I lather, rinse, and repeat.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a lot of suds but it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch at all. I just apply shampoo twice. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Another fragrance free product for those with sensitive skin.  Does the job in the shower and priced reasonable.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a hypoallergenic shampoo that does not strip hair color.  I will say I haven&#x27;t gotten used to the lack of lather in these types of shampoos, though.  So what I do is use another shampoo that I can mostly tolerate (but will cause some skin problems if I use it alone). This other shampoo lathers some and also protects my color. After rinsing that out really well, I use this one to essentially rinse out all the residue from the first shampoo.  For me, this approach works great since I have to do two sudsings anyway.  I feel I can use less of this more expensive product doing this, and I have yet to have any kind of skin reaction this way.</li>
    <li> It is oil free and fragrance free, it is very watery I washed my hair with it, I had to use quite a bit to do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the conditioner, I wish they make a product for heat protectant more importantly a frizz control treatment. PLease.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to all sorts of plant-based ingredients, essential oils, and perfumes. This brand of hair products has a short list of ingredients and doesn&#x27;t give me rashes, nosebleeds, etc., which I get from other brands.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is fragrance-free and cleans hair well, but caused terrible itching of my scalp.  I could not use it again.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo but it makes my hair dry.  It smells nice but after I finish this bottle, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works well, as promised no fragrance or salicyates.  Takes a bit more shampoo than the high-quality ones, but leave hair clean but not dried out.</li>
    <li> Love it love it , yes expansive but if you are allergic to fragrance this is a product you should buy.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, you do have to use more of this shampoo than you would the average shampoo because it is more watery.  The reason why other shampoos foam up though is because of the chemicals they put in them to do it so I&#x27;m fine that I have to use more and don&#x27;t have as foamy of an effect with this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies like other shampoos have and it makes my hair really soft.  All in all, I love it.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this shampoo. Since it is fragrance free she adds a few drops of Sweet Orange essential oils to create her own fragrance. It is a natural product and leaves your hair in great condition.</li>
    <li> It does a good job, but I have to use SOO much of it at one time. I wash my hair every 3-4 days and it has a really hard time washing that build up out. A lot of times I will have to shampoo twice to make sure my hair gets all the way clean.</li>
