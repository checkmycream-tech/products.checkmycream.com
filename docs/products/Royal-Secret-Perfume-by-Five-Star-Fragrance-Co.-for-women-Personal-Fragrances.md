      <li>I can no Longer find the powder, so I was delighted to find this.  </li>
      <li>I found it was a good value and shipped</li>
      <li>A scent I loved from 30years ago in a body powder.  </li>
      <li>I was so impressed by the quick service and receving within days.  </li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you chose it!</li>

      <li>Nice to know this product still exists, my elderly Mom will be thrilled.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this perfume to EVERYONE that wants great quality!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>I have used this for years and get many, many compliments on how pleasant and captivating it is.  </li>
      <li>So happy Judy found this classic fragrance!</li>
      <li>I hope I am always able to find it.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m so pleased that I tried it and that you did indeed have my favorite perfume.  </li>
      <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Lovely fragrance, have used it for years.</li>
      <li>Perfumes were authentic.</li>
      <li>I know many people aren&#x27;t familar with it by</li>
      <li>So elegant.</li>
      <li>I love it, and don&#x27;t want to be without it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This has been my oldest fragrance love.</li>
      <li>She was greatly pleased to receive it as I was to smell it.</li>
      <li>Love the fragrance and the price.</li>
      <li>I think though they discontinued making it, but love it and glad I found it on Amazon</li>
      <li>Sure, I love my celebrity fruity florals and hyper-clean body sprays...</li>
      <li>RS is a true old-school Oriental: warm, spicy, and musky, it becomes one with the wearer&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>I even prefer the Five Star version for work, as it&#x27;s more subdued and friendly to others&#x27; noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was informed of a formula change that made this once fine product suck.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a lovely warm oriental scent with a soft powder finish.</li>
      <li>Once it lures you in with its luscious myrrh and resinous spices, it moves quickly into more of a woodsy chypre direction, powdery and clean.</li>
      <li>that isn&#x27;t even close to the Germaine Monteil original...</li>
      <li>to my surprise; this fragrance is identical to the original item purchased.  </li>
      <li>This review is for the product shown: the Five Star Fragrances relaunch of the discontinued original from Germaine Monteil.</li>
      <li>Years ago I worked in the Cosmetic industry; specifically for Germaine Monteil ~ when I originally purchased this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am now at the end of the original bottle and decided to look on line to see if I could find it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does not smell anything like the original.</li>
      <li>The Product arrived in good condition and on time; however the fragrance IS NOT THE ORIGINAL BY ANY STANDARD.</li>
      <li>At that time and ever sense, no matter when I wear this people comment on how soft and lovely it smells.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You can just tell from the dark-brown juice and the amber cap with its elegant scrolled cursive, that this is a powerful, rich fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for years and never fail to get compliments on it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Lucky for me, it&#x27;s a natural match with my chemistry and never overpowers others.</li>
      <li>Just as described and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I have been using Royal Secret for years and still get compliments from strangers about how great it smells.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just hoping that they are not getting ready to stop making it.</li>
      <li>So thank you so much for carrying it.  </li>
      <li>A real treat for me.</li>
      <li>Beyond reasonable.</li>
      <li>this is a fragrance that I really like and it happpens to be one that my wife likes a lot as well.</li>
      <li>I LOVE Royal Secret and hope I will be able to continue to get it thru Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for Royal Secret for many many months without any luck.  </li>
      <li>I do have a bottle of the vintage Monteil original and find that one a bit deeper and more complex, but Five Star did a pretty good job of capturing the spirit of Royal Secret.</li>
      <li>It is highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Amazon is one of the few places I can find my favorite fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It is clearly an attempted knock off</li>
      <li>WOW.</li>
      <li>I associate it closely with my mom, who wore it in the &#x27;70s as a young woman.</li>
      <li>I get comments from males, females, old, young, etc.</li>
      <li>It is never overwhelming and lasts all day a true classic.</li>
      <li>I know you&#x27;re saying I&#x27;m an old &amp;#34;stuck in the last century&amp;#34;</li>

<li> I will continue using this cologne as long as they keep selling it.</li>
<li> Would like fragrance to last a little longer though, seems not as long lasting as years ago.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Royal Secret for at least 20-25 years with many complements.  </li>
<li> Was everything I expected.</li>
<li> But when I smell RS I can&#x27;t help but think of a time and place where fragrances were carefully constructed masterpieces.</li>
<li> It is getting harder to find it</li>
<li> I have such a hard time with Orientals like Opium and Youth-Dew, as they smell downright fecal to me.</li>
<li> Frankly, I thought that after having this in it&#x27;s original bottle all these years It might have gone bad.  </li>
<li> The overall effect is earthy and subtle, yet sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> We have a previous purchase and they don&#x27;t come close.</li>
<li> Royal Secret has been my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent for at least the last twenty years.</li>
<li> Royal Secret has been my signature fragrance for over fifty years...</li>
<li> what I received is NOT Royal Secret...</li>
<li> I had ordered royal secret elsewhere</li>
<li> The new fragrance is awful!!!  </li>

    <li> Nice to know this product still exists, my elderly Mom will be thrilled.  I found it was a good value and shipped well packed.</li>
    <li> Years ago I worked in the Cosmetic industry; specifically for Germaine Monteil ~ when I originally purchased this fragrance. At that time and ever sense, no matter when I wear this people comment on how soft and lovely it smells.  Frankly, I thought that after having this in it&#x27;s original bottle all these years It might have gone bad.  I am now at the end of the original bottle and decided to look on line to see if I could find it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise; this fragrance is identical to the original item purchased.  In fact, the bottom of both bottles, say Five Star Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who Knew????</li>
    <li> Just as described and fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This original is very hard to find. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and the price. Beyond reasonable. Would recommend to everyone who wanted great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase. Would buy again. Perfumes were authentic. Will make another perfume order soon.Would recommend to others</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent! I always get compliments when I wear it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Royal Secret for years and still get compliments from strangers about how great it smells.  It is not overbearing at all.  I will continue using this cologne as long as they keep selling it.</li>
    <li> I was informed of a formula change that made this once fine product suck.</li>
    <li> Royal Secret has been my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent for at least the last twenty years. I know you&#x27;re saying I&#x27;m an old &amp;#34;stuck in the last century&amp;#34; lady, but when everyone asks what that is I&#x27;m wearing and tells me I smell delicious, I have to take their word. I&#x27;m just hoping that they are not getting ready to stop making it. It is getting harder to find it so if you&#x27;re going to try it, now is the time.</li>
    <li> Amazon is one of the few places I can find my favorite fragrance.  I have used this for years and get many, many compliments on how pleasant and captivating it is.  I hope I am always able to find it. I get comments from males, females, old, young, etc. about how &amp;#34;good I smell&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I remembered this perfume when I was a kid.  I bought it  and I LOVE it. Just like i remember. It last&#x27;s all day. It makes you want to just sigh, it&#x27;s that  ahhhhhh</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful...WHY are they changing it.  The new fragrance is awful!!!  Please do not stop making this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for years and never fail to get compliments on it.  You&#x27;ll be glad you chose it!</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this perfume I get so many compliments like &amp;#34; you smell Wonderful what is it that you are wearing?&amp;#34; Well this time I  bought the fragrance to give to a friend of mine who wanted to give it as a gift to his mother. The fragrance is a lovely warm oriental scent with a soft powder finish. It is never overwhelming and lasts all day a true classic. It is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> ...as I knew already. Great smell. I think though they discontinued making it, but love it and glad I found it on Amazon</li>
    <li> Was everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Royal Secret has been my signature fragrance for over fifty years...what I received is NOT Royal Secret...It is clearly an attempted knock off that isn&#x27;t even close to the Germaine Monteil original...I should have heeded the reviews that some others had posted...This product is an imposter...buyers beware.</li>
    <li> not as I remember it...</li>
    <li> Great parfum and was thrilled I was able to find this on Amazon - thank you:)</li>
    <li> Seemed like a knock off</li>

    <li> Smells wonderful and lasts!</li>
    <li> Does not smell anything like the original.Would not recommend to anybody.</li>
    <li> The Product arrived in good condition and on time; however the fragrance IS NOT THE ORIGINAL BY ANY STANDARD. NOT EVEN SIMILIAR; AND HAS NO LASTING POWER; NO ONE CAN EVEN DETECT THE FRAGANCE WHEN WORN. I WILL NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for Royal Secret for many many months without any luck.  I&#x27;ve never used Amazon before but I&#x27;m so pleased that I tried it and that you did indeed have my favorite perfume.  I&#x27;ve been using Royal Secret for at least 20-25 years with many complements.  I know many people aren&#x27;t familar with it by I love it, and don&#x27;t want to be without it.  So thank you so much for carrying it.  I was so impressed by the quick service and receving within days.  WOW.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my  mom for Christmas. She couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores. So i was happy i found it for her on here. She&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>

    <li> Lovely fragrance, have used it for years. Would like fragrance to last a little longer though, seems not as long lasting as years ago.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift to a wonderful woman. She was greatly pleased to receive it as I was to smell it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Royal Secret and hope I will be able to continue to get it thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> The formula was changed. We have a previous purchase and they don&#x27;t come close. Will NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
    <li> Does not seem quite the same scent but close enough. I had ordered royal secret elsewhere but it was not by germain monteil but the packaging  looked like it.</li>
