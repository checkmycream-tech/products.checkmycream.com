      <li>All you need with a cute travel case</li>
      <li>I love it its everything</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s super cute too!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re seven soft, beautiful brushes in this kit.</li>
      <li>Love these brushes makes a huge difference when I&#x27;m putting on my make up</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfect set for me because I don&#x27;t have a lot of space in my dorm, and these are compact but they still have the same brush heads as the full size.</li>
      <li>so soft, ideal for a quick make up</li>
      <li>But other than that they are excellent brushes!</li>
      <li>having all the essential brushes, this kit is great for travel.</li>
      <li>These are exactly cheap either.</li>
      <li>These brushes are gorgeous to look at, soft to the touch, made of high quality material, but most importantly they distribute makeup like a dream!</li>
      <li>I love it because it is a great little compact way to carry the minimum brushed needed to pull off a great look.</li>
      <li>my only problem is that the  F40 - Large Angled Contour smells funny but the rest is just perfect</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been lusting after these brushes since going on a trip with a friend who had them, but I wasn&#x27;t able to convince myself to purchase the full set because the price was so high.</li>
      <li>WORTHY THE PRICE.</li>
      <li>it is a very pretty package.</li>
      <li>not pink though kinda off pink but the best everrrrr!!</li>
      <li>When I first received this I was solo excited</li>
      <li>These brushes are worth the money</li>
      <li>I wanted Its good quality its pink</li>
      <li>The travel cups the kit came in also come in handy, especially when traveling.</li>
      <li>It came with just the right amount of starter and necessity brushes.</li>
      <li>They are nothing special and nothing short of cheap and what you would expect from China made products.</li>
      <li>but if you are willing to give it a try</li>
      <li>I gave one to my make-up guru flight attendant friend and she loves it!</li>
      <li>But the brushes, thou small, are still good quality.....</li>
      <li>They were super soft</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence about ordering these brushes and you enjoy makeup enough to handle the price I highly recommend ordering them!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these brushes!</li>
      <li>I would really recommend this prodct to all you make up addicts like me</li>
      <li>it cause I&#x27;ve heard so much abt these brushes.</li>
      <li>however when I went to use and clean them, I experienced a bit of shedding which was disappointing.</li>
      <li>It last so long and works amazingly.</li>
      <li>Now I only wish I would&#x27;ve just gone ahead and purchased the full set.</li>
      <li>The coloring is not the same as it looks online, it&#x27;s not as bright, and it&#x27;s more of a coral/reddish color than it is pink, so I&#x27;m assuming the other colors are the same way.</li>
      <li>Not bad compared to other brands.  </li>
      <li>It looks so professional.</li>
      <li>The kit for my needs is almost complete.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast and I also got a extra gift for purchasing like I would if I bought from the website itself!</li>
      <li>Really thought it was bigger....</li>
      <li>They are so soft and the brushes do not shed.</li>
      <li>Without much use, the metal brush heads kept falling off the wooden stems.  </li>
      <li>I love itttt, it&#x27;s very small even smaller than it looks in the pic</li>
      <li>, i instantly felt how soft the bristles were and durable the brushes are, and</li>
      <li>and i was sooooo anxious to get them that when the brushes finally arrived at my house i ripped the whole box open and started using the brushes right away</li>
      <li>Much less expensive than Mac brushes with results that are just as good.</li>

<li> I only had to add a few other brushes to complete my set.</li>
<li> the brushes are tough, I only use the cap &amp; the large angled contour..</li>
<li> I have a few Mac brushes and these do not come close the quality nor do I expect these to last half as long.</li>
<li> The other for eye brushes.  </li>
<li> Very minimal shedding.</li>
<li> If you wash them at least once a week, these brushes should last you a very long time and with very little shedding.  </li>

<li> I do not recommend this product since after 1 months regular use the brush is getting tough.</li>

<li> the rest is a waste of money..</li>
<li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m absolutely not happy with this brushes..</li>
<li> I fell for the hype:(  </li>

    <li> أنا مرة أخرى لأكثر! انها لا تحصل على أفضل من ذلك. سأفعل، وسوف نكون سعداء لشرائها مرة أخرى.&lt;br /&gt;هل أقول أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة. يا &amp;#34;حسنا أنا لا أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة.</li>
    <li> I thought the product was amazing. i loved the packaging and storage. It came with just the right amount of starter and necessity brushes. They were super soft however when I went to use and clean them, I experienced a bit of shedding which was disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes makes a huge difference when I&#x27;m putting on my make up</li>
    <li> Fantastic brushes the best I own!!!</li>
    <li> I would like to give my honest review with Sigma Travel Kit..I&#x27;m absolutely not happy with this brushes..I feel I&#x27;d wasted money in purchasing this product..I won&#x27;t recommend this brushes..but if you are willing to give it a try it&#x27;s all up to you...the brushes are tough, I only use the cap &amp; the large angled contour..the rest is a waste of money..</li>
    <li> I thought I had good brushes until I received the Sigma brushes. I have a brush for every type of application. They are so soft and the brushes do not shed. The case is the icing on the cake. It looks so professional. I am very happy with my purchase. I have returned for additional brushes.</li>
    <li> Product was great, but I paid for gift wrapping for my girlfriend, and the wrapping was a joke.</li>
    <li> so soft, ideal for a quick make up</li>
    <li> All you need with a cute travel case</li>
    <li> These brushes are gorgeous to look at, soft to the touch, made of high quality material, but most importantly they distribute makeup like a dream! I&#x27;d been lusting after these brushes since going on a trip with a friend who had them, but I wasn&#x27;t able to convince myself to purchase the full set because the price was so high. I saw the travel kit and knew it was the perfect compromise! Now I only wish I would&#x27;ve just gone ahead and purchased the full set. However, I do plan on ordering the essentials kit soon and retiring this travel sized one for actual traveling or use in the car or something. If you&#x27;re on the fence about ordering these brushes and you enjoy makeup enough to handle the price I highly recommend ordering them!</li>
    <li> I love itttt, it&#x27;s very small even smaller than it looks in the pic and it works for travelling and going out.</li>
    <li> The price is a little steep, but you get seven brushes.  That&#x27;s like ten bucks a brush.  Not bad compared to other brands.  If you wash them at least once a week, these brushes should last you a very long time and with very little shedding.  The container is great for use on the vanity as well as travel.  One cup for face brushes.  The other for eye brushes.  I gave one to my make-up guru flight attendant friend and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting this product for so long and I finally ordered it off of amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!! These brushes are worth the money and I don&#x27;t regret buying these at all!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!</li>
    <li> Minha esposa amou receber esse belo presente. Parece que as mulheres sempre gostam dessas coisas, então nada melhor do que pode presentea-las.</li>
    <li> good quality  love these brushes</li>
    <li> You can get a brush set for $25-30 bucks for the same quality brushes. These brushes are made in China. They are nothing special and nothing short of cheap and what you would expect from China made products. I have a few Mac brushes and these do not come close the quality nor do I expect these to last half as long. Please don&#x27;t waste your money. These are exactly cheap either.</li>
