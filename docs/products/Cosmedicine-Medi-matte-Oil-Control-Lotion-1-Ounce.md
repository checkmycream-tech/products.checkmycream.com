      <li>It was the perfect foundation, mattifier and sunscreen all in one.  </li>
      <li>After running out of the samply, he began telling me how awesome this stuff was and that he NEEDED it.</li>
      <li>It does a beautiful job of mattifying oily skin.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a mattifying lotion for years and this one works great.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer works great and amazon had a great price.</li>
      <li>I have used this primer for a couple years and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>Great for anyone with oily or combination skin.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, it&#x27;s the best on the market in my opinion.</li>
      <li>He loved it.  </li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t find anything else that works as good and has an SPF.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth with a flawless, matte finish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite face product!</li>
      <li>He has the kind of skin that would need blotting papers throughout the day.</li>
      <li>But if you are looking for a great lotion to wear daily to work that doesn&#x27;t clog pores and keeps the shine away, this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Kind of pricey but will buy again.</li>
      <li>I sincerely hope they start making it again.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product..</li>
      <li>I found it worked better if i patted it on instead of rubbing it in</li>
      <li>I love this product..</li>
      <li>Makeup looks better and it feels better.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t understand why anyone can give this more then 1 star.</li>
      <li>Then my pursuit to find the perfect moisturizer that will keep my shiny look to a minimum became a constant struggle.</li>
      <li>Some beauty sampling program for sure.  </li>
      <li>-matte does a great job of controling shine and offers sun protection too.  </li>
      <li>Oil still does form but blots away easily</li>
      <li>(1x a day) I broke out and got 2 huge pumples.  </li>
      <li>Anyway.. this is not only a great mosturizer cause even with oily skin you need moisture..</li>
      <li>It also makes your skin look amazing, poreless, matte and soft focus.  </li>
      <li>and I got him a full sized.  </li>
      <li>My face actually was more oily after applying it &amp; applying makeup on top of it.</li>
      <li>Luckily I had won a gift card to amazon</li>
      <li>I applied it lightly the first time, it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it:)</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>It is also easier on freshly moisturized skin.</li>
      <li>and it is completely worth it.  </li>
      <li>It lasts the entire work day and I can tell by the way my face blotting sheets look (as well as just simply looking in the mirror)that the Medi-Matte Oil Control Lotion works great.  </li>
      <li>Hands down, the best product on the market that stops shine in its tracks - all day long.  </li>
      <li>So I searched high and low with cosmetic retailers and was thrilled to find the product on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>From $500 to $15 I tried everything, and unfortunately never found anything to replace my medi matte.</li>
      <li>first tried this product last summer and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>Overall, I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>Better luck next time!</li>
      <li>My first exposure to Medi-matte was in a sample (I believe from Bliss).  </li>
      <li>I love it, now they need to make a higher SPF for summer but keep the same matte effect.  </li>
      <li>*sigh*).  </li>
      <li>Without using any mattifying products I have to blot about every 2 hours using 2 sheets of Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s oil absorbing sheets.</li>
      <li>I love how much moisture it provides to my dry areas and keep my shine to a minimum on my t-zone, in addition is had SPF!</li>
      <li>I just use it on the T-Zone and sides of my mouth where I get very oily throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitize and oily skin.</li>
      <li>It literally does absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>Works very well as a moisturizer and oil control for oily to combination skin types.  </li>
      <li>Plus, I like that it has SPF because I&#x27;m very fair-skinned.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love that it has sunscreen without being heavy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily facial skin and this product works pretty well at keeping the shine away.  </li>
      <li>As I&#x27;ve become more sun-saavy, I tried some BB creams and found them to be too opaque and heavy</li>
      <li>My skin tone is normal to oily.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my boyfriend after we got a sample in a new beauty test tube</li>
      <li>Does not dry out my skin, but doesn&#x27;t really moisturize it either.</li>
      <li>I have an oily complexion and live in Florida, so it gets even worse in warm weather.</li>
      <li>I purchased this with high hopes, seeing as how I have very oily skin and always love to have a little extra sunscreen coverage, but with use I was still finding myself needing to blot my forehead multiple times a day.</li>
      <li>My skin is quite sensitive, and the sunscreen component doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate at all.  </li>
      <li>I am going to be 60 years old and believe it or not I still break out</li>
      <li>I was really surprised this worked as well as it did.  </li>
      <li>More thick the second time, and still absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>but it will keep my very oily skin matte (not dry) for an entire work day.  </li>
      <li>I just hate that I&#x27;m spending way more for it since it&#x27;s becoming less available at stores</li>
      <li>The texture seems odd at first - it&#x27;s like tacky glue -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried sooo many mattifying products that didn&#x27;t live up to their promises and sadly this one is no different.</li>
      <li>I am super greasy and this hardly did anything to help me at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super thick and after 2 days of using it</li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the SPF was higher and it can make your makeup look a little cakey depending on the type of makeup you use over the product or if you don&#x27;t rub it in well enough.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very thick and scent free.</li>

<li> Small amounts go a long way and it really does leave you with a matte finish!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s on the pricier side, but one tube will last a LONG time.</li>
<li> Long lasting.</li>
<li> I will never understand how my skin can be both greasy and dry at the same time...</li>
<li> This was recommended to me by a friend that has used it for a long time now.</li>
<li> Then I decided to look for this long lost product online and voila!</li>
<li> tube lasts a LONG time!</li>
<li> I wear this every single day, with or without makeup.  </li>
<li> Use over your regular moisturizer or face cream (only a small amount is needed) and under make-up.  </li>
<li> I usually only use it on my nose and forehead, so I put other sunscreen on my cheeks (which, oddly, are usually dry</li>
<li> You only need a very small amount to moisturize your entire face.</li>
<li> The consistency is a little strange when applying on your face</li>
<li> It&#x27;s alot for the money you are paying and a little goes quite a long way...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the sunscreen mixed with it that causes the oil of what, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
<li> I have combination skin but the oily sections are extremely oily.  </li>
<li> but I found the material from the larger tubes goes on easier than from the small sample.</li>
<li> This is a fabulous product but difficult to find (at least in San Antonio).  </li>
<li> Just a small amount (a little bit larger than pea-sized) on my face takes away the shine for hours and helps my makeup stay put.</li>
<li> It is pretty expensive for 1 ounce, and I use about a nickel-size everyday to moisturize my face.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s awful on one hand but good on another?</li>
<li> It cuts waaay down on the shine on the face.  </li>
<li> It makes me sad that the company stopped making this product and even more sad that they don&#x27;t have the Tinted version.  </li>
<li> but still less than i&#x27;d hoped for.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this with high hopes, seeing as how I have very oily skin and always love to have a little extra sunscreen coverage, but with use I was still finding myself needing to blot my forehead multiple times a day. Better luck next time!</li>
    <li> This lotion comes out looking like white glue, it&#x27;s very thick and can be somewhat difficult to spread but when I see how matte my forehead and nose look, I could care less about how thick it is.  I can&#x27;t go out without it now.  It keeps the oil under control and have had no breakouts from it.  I love it, now they need to make a higher SPF for summer but keep the same matte effect.  Price seems a little high for only an ounce but I can&#x27;t find anything else that works as good and has an SPF.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitize and oily skin. I have been looking for a mattifying lotion for years and this one works great. It is pretty expensive for 1 ounce, and I use about a nickel-size everyday to moisturize my face. If you are looking for a lotion that is thin and can be used all the time, this one isn&#x27;t for you. But if you are looking for a great lotion to wear daily to work that doesn&#x27;t clog pores and keeps the shine away, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the SPF was higher and it can make your makeup look a little cakey depending on the type of makeup you use over the product or if you don&#x27;t rub it in well enough.  Overall, I LOVE this product.  I just use it on the T-Zone and sides of my mouth where I get very oily throughout the day. This product keeps my face matte without causing any breakouts.</li>
    <li> I love this product.. I am going to be 60 years old and believe it or not I still break out and I still have oily skin!!! It&#x27;s awful on one hand but good on another? A double edged sword i guess? Anyway.. this is not only a great mosturizer cause even with oily skin you need moisture.. but it mattifys my make-up AND a bonus is that it has an SPF of 20 I think... It&#x27;s alot for the money you are paying and a little goes quite a long way... I LOVE this product.. Would not ever want to be without it!!</li>
    <li> I have an oily complexion and live in Florida, so it gets even worse in warm weather. I used to look shiny in every photo I was in and my face felt greasy just a couple of  hours after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this product last summer and fell in love with it. Just a small amount (a little bit larger than pea-sized) on my face takes away the shine for hours and helps my makeup stay put. Plus, I like that it has SPF because I&#x27;m very fair-skinned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff! Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin but the oily sections are extremely oily.  I was really surprised this worked as well as it did.  The consistency is a little strange when applying on your face but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and it is completely worth it.  It lasts the entire work day and I can tell by the way my face blotting sheets look (as well as just simply looking in the mirror)that the Medi-Matte Oil Control Lotion works great.  Having SPF 20 is bonus since I look for that in my daily lotion.  It is on the expensive side (the only reason it is 4 stars, not 5) but I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works very well as a moisturizer and oil control for oily to combination skin types.  I just wish it came in a bigger tube.  1 oz. lasts for about 6 weeks if using every day.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t understand why anyone can give this more then 1 star. I applied it lightly the first time, it didn&#x27;t do anything. More thick the second time, and still absolutely nothing. No matter how I apply it I can fill up a blot sheet in about an hour. It literally does absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> I am super greasy and this hardly did anything to help me at all. It&#x27;s super thick and after 2 days of using it (1x a day) I broke out and got 2 huge pumples.  No thank you!</li>
    <li> It makes me sad that the company stopped making this product and even more sad that they don&#x27;t have the Tinted version.  It was the perfect foundation, mattifier and sunscreen all in one.  I sincerely hope they start making it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend after we got a sample in a new beauty test tube *i think*. Some beauty sampling program for sure.  After running out of the samply, he began telling me how awesome this stuff was and that he NEEDED it. Luckily I had won a gift card to amazon and I got him a full sized.  He loved it.  He has the kind of skin that would need blotting papers throughout the day. With this lotion he feels protected and the oil-slick is under control. He&#x27;s a happy man!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product but difficult to find (at least in San Antonio).  It cuts waaay down on the shine on the face.  Makeup looks better and it feels better.  Your face does not feel oily.  Anyone with oily skin knows what I am talking about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried sooo many mattifying products that didn&#x27;t live up to their promises and sadly this one is no different. I found it worked better if i patted it on instead of rubbing it in but it didn&#x27;t have the staying power i hoped it would. Without using any mattifying products I have to blot about every 2 hours using 2 sheets of Clean &amp; Clear&#x27;s oil absorbing sheets. Using this product i still blotted every two hours but with only 1 blotting sheet. That&#x27;s an improvement i guess but still less than i&#x27;d hoped for. I&#x27;ve gone back to using Smashbox Anti-shine until i find something else. Big disappointment!</li>
    <li> It does a beautiful job of mattifying oily skin. Does not dry out my skin, but doesn&#x27;t really moisturize it either. It&#x27;s a little thick but you only need a tiny bit(mostly the T-zone). Long lasting. Kind of pricey but will buy again.</li>
    <li> I trust this to prevent my skin from being to oily and also to provide sun protection.  This is always my go-to face cream.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it&#x27;s the best on the market in my opinion. I just hate that I&#x27;m spending way more for it since it&#x27;s becoming less available at stores but 1 oz. tube lasts a LONG time!</li>
    <li> I have very oily facial skin and this product works pretty well at keeping the shine away.  Oil still does form but blots away easily and the shine is kept at a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best product on the market that stops shine in its tracks - all day long.  It also makes your skin look amazing, poreless, matte and soft focus.  Great for anyone with oily or combination skin.</li>
    <li> My first exposure to Medi-matte was in a sample (I believe from Bliss).  As I&#x27;ve become more sun-saavy, I tried some BB creams and found them to be too opaque and heavy looking.&lt;br /&gt;Medi-matte does a great job of controling shine and offers sun protection too.  Some skin products (sunscreens or BB creams) cause my mascara to smudge under my eyes but with this, I can still moisturize, apply Medi-matte and have smudge-free SPF.  Best of all worlds if you ask me.  So I searched high and low with cosmetic retailers and was thrilled to find the product on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I can understand the comments about the product thickness but I found the material from the larger tubes goes on easier than from the small sample. It is also easier on freshly moisturized skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works great and amazon had a great price. Small amounts go a long way and it really does leave you with a matte finish!</li>
    <li> Best product out there for oily skin or controlling shine on any areas of the face. Use over your regular moisturizer or face cream (only a small amount is needed) and under make-up.  I swear by this mattifier. My skin tone is normal to oily.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and this product is seriously a life saver! I will never understand how my skin can be both greasy and dry at the same time...but this lotion solves both problems! It leaves my skin silky smooth with a flawless, matte finish. It&#x27;s on the pricier side, but one tube will last a LONG time. You only need a very small amount to moisturize your entire face. It&#x27;s very thick and scent free. I couldn&#x27;t live without it:)</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend that has used it for a long time now. My daughter loves it she has bad acne and this is helping some!</li>
    <li> I had been using this matte moisturizer until it was discontinued. Then my pursuit to find the perfect moisturizer that will keep my shiny look to a minimum became a constant struggle. From $500 to $15 I tried everything, and unfortunately never found anything to replace my medi matte. Then I decided to look for this long lost product online and voila! I love how much moisture it provides to my dry areas and keep my shine to a minimum on my t-zone, in addition is had SPF! One less thing I have to worry about. It&#x27;s my favorite face product!</li>
    <li> If this product were discontinued, I&#x27;d buy a thousand tubes of it.  This is the only oil-control lotion I&#x27;ve ever found that makes a difference.  The texture seems odd at first - it&#x27;s like tacky glue - but it will keep my very oily skin matte (not dry) for an entire work day.  I love that it has sunscreen without being heavy or greasy.  I wear this every single day, with or without makeup.  I usually only use it on my nose and forehead, so I put other sunscreen on my cheeks (which, oddly, are usually dry *sigh*).  My skin is quite sensitive, and the sunscreen component doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate at all.  If you want oil control that works and sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate, do yourself a favor and order this stuff immediately.  I&#x27;d give it ten stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I have used this primer for a couple years and my skin looks great. Keeps the shine away as promised.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by the product! My face actually was more oily after applying it &amp; applying makeup on top of it. I use a mineral powder which usually cuts down on the oil. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the sunscreen mixed with it that causes the oil of what, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
