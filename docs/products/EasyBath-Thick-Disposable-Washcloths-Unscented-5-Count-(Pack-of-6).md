      <li>i said, the product works, but it requires &amp;#34;circumstances&amp;#34; where this would be used mostly.</li>

      <li>Wow, am I ever glad I had the chance to try this product!  </li>
      <li>They do a good job of cleaning, but I see these as something to put in your \\&quot;emergency kit,\\&quot; not as something to use on a regular basis.  </li>
      <li>Much thicker and stronger than the baby wipes that most people use camping and on the run.</li>
      <li>The EasyBath Thick Disposable Washcloths are great!  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re perfect for small children but an adult may need more than one if using them for a full buy wash-up.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re sudsier than diaper wipes, but the &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; stuff disappears rather quickly.</li>
      <li>Besides being great cleaning cloths, the packaging is very convenient, with a pull back flap (think Oreo packages)</li>
      <li>I use them during travel for a quick refresh in airports or on the plane for longer flights, and sometimes just during the workday when I get to feeling grungy on warmer days.</li>
      <li>I love these and highly recommend them for anyone who enjoys exercising but can’t take a bath or shower afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they will be able to use these disposable washcloths every day for a long time without having to get into a shower or tub.  </li>
      <li>that opens and closes easily and seals very well.  </li>
      <li>large size and thickness makes them very efficient for most clean-ups.  </li>
      <li>Super nice for a gym bag or travel days when you&#x27;re stuck in a car or a plane for long hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These were perfect for daily cleansing and unlike other brands we&#x27;ve tried over time, didn&#x27;t leave her skin feeling sticky.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>The amount of moisture is just right.  </li>
      <li>He used them and they cleaned him right up.  </li>
      <li>These are great, disposable washclothes equally useful for both adults and small children.</li>
      <li>Yet they clean very efficiently -</li>
      <li>I can see these being handy while traveling on a fairly long car trip or airplane trip with a child.  </li>
      <li>These thick, soft washcloths are wonderful, and deserve to be called washcloths, rather than just wipes.  </li>
      <li>The manufacturer, Easy Bath, claims there is no need to rinse and for the most part that seems okay, except for a slight sticky sensation left on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>- they may get too hot and steamy).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;EasyBath really changed my mind!</li>
      <li>these disposable wet cloths will come in handy.  </li>
      <li>They deliver exactly what they promise.  </li>
      <li>He smelled much better and one cloth was enough to do his whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These wipes are also substantial enough to do a quick clean up after a lunchtime walk or workout during my work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Definitely plan to purchase Easy Bath for those RV road trips.</li>
      <li>The package is an easy resealable plastic with the sticky peel back cover.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You can heat it to a certain extent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Sized at 8&amp;#34;x8&amp;#34;, they&#x27;re large.</li>
      <li>can certainly \\&quot;feel\\&quot; that I have used one.  </li>
      <li>Heating the wipes in the microwave before using does make the washing up experience more pleasant on a cold day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These EasyBath wipes would have been much more useful and less wasteful.</li>
      <li>This product will be something I can tell her about because not only do they work, they also can fit into her pack without taking up much room at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very satisfactory.</li>
      <li>Very convenient.</li>
      <li>They are not thin wipes and will not fall apart or shred.</li>
      <li>price is also reasonable, and the packet size is just what you need when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
      <li>Anywhere water might not be readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My problem is that they are soapy and really need to be rinsed after using.</li>
      <li>There are five disposable washcloths in each pouch, but like most products resealed with a sticky flap, I expect this product to dry out somewhat quickly after opening, i.e. don&#x27;t expect it to be moist months later after they&#x27;ve been in the glove compartment.</li>
      <li>These are a little bit cool at room temperature but not enough that it made me want to warm it in the microwave.  </li>
      <li>These are excellent for big messes, but a little too large to use as a &#x27;wet nap&#x27; type of cloth.</li>
      <li>They are incredibly handy cloths that really feel like a small washcloth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I much prefer Wet Ones, though they are in kind of a \\&quot;different league\\&quot; than the EasyBath</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These washcloths are thick and soft and hold enough liquid to go a long way.  There&#x27;s no odor and they don&#x27;t cause irritation or leave any annoying residue.  Besides being great cleaning cloths, the packaging is very convenient, with a pull back flap (think Oreo packages) that opens and closes easily and seals very well.  There shouldn&#x27;t be any problem with the cloths drying out even if the package sits in the car for long periods.  The price per sheet is high, so we&#x27;ll use these for big jobs while away from home.  Great for the car, backpack, fishing vest, etc.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These disposable washcloths are indeed unscented, something that is important to me. They are also thick, much thicker than the generic wet wipes I&#x27;m currently carrying in my car. And, as advertised, they do not leave any discernible residue behind, nor, to me, do they feel soapy. They are a bit smaller in size than a standard washcloth, but still have a substantial feel. Heating the wipes in the microwave before using does make the washing up experience more pleasant on a cold day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can think of many situations in which I would find these disposable washcloths handy to have. I usually try to keep a package of wet wipes in the car for spills and sticky fingers associated with snacking and minor cleanups after visits to the park, barn, or beach. I also like to stick a package of disposable wipes in my briefcase for business travel for everything from cleaning off the drop-down tray on the plane to freshening up in the airport restroom after a long flight. These wipes are also substantial enough to do a quick clean up after a lunchtime walk or workout during my work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase these wipes to carry in the car, keep in my desk drawer at work (along with the toothbrush/toothpaste and antiperspirant I currently have stashed there), and stick in my briefcase before heading for the airport.</li>
    <li> These washcloths are the size of a thick washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are wet but not dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is absolutely no odor/smell.  They do not irritate the eyes.  They don&#x27;t seem to irritate the skin.  They eliminate odor and oils.  Dirt... that goes without saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is resealable and portable.  Don&#x27;t flush the washcloths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is what it is and it does what it does well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm is the price...</li>
    <li> [Good]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good sized disposable washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up its ingredients. They are safe and non-toxic, which isn&#x27;t always the case for both baby and kid&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can heat it to a certain extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a resealable pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Ok]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can think of is that it&#x27;s disposable which isn&#x27;t that great for the environment compared to a reusable towel. This is a really minor complaint, since you know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> The EasyBath Thick Disposable Washcloths are perfect for those moments that people often have in life where they get just a little messy, but a full scale bath or shower is not needed or unavailable. This could be because a person is on the go or because the mess is fairly minor. They are quite thick as implied by the product name. Because of this thickness, they aren&#x27;t going to break up if one has to rub particularly hard to get at a particularly stubborn mess. There also isn&#x27;t a scent or smell, even after use, which one occasionally finds with conventional washcloths. Overall, I think this is a great product for persons with small children who seem to always encounter messes and those people like myself who should change their middle name to clumsy.</li>
    <li> These are great. I use them during travel for a quick refresh in airports or on the plane for longer flights, and sometimes just during the workday when I get to feeling grungy on warmer days.</li>
    <li> These 8 inch by 8 inch cloth-like washcloths are very thick and have almost no scent. They have just the right amount of moisture and cleaning product so that they are not dripping wet or makings suds all over. Yet they clean very efficiently - I tried one out on messy faces and dirty feet and all came clean. The manufacturer, Easy Bath, claims there is no need to rinse and for the most part that seems okay, except for a slight sticky sensation left on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for cleaning children up when a sink or tub is not handy or for caring for someone who is ill and needs to be freshened up but not up to taking a sponge bath at the sink or a shower. I didn&#x27;t try it but the packet can be put in the microwave for a warm soothing experience.</li>
    <li> The disposable washcloths work as well, with the only issue I can see is that the towels will dry out if not in the resealable package if not used right away.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use, though, as you take it out and use it. Lots of moisture and you can even warm them up if you wish and don&#x27;t want cold liquid on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One use I can see it handy for is if you&#x27;re camping out and want to get clean without using suspicious source water from the river/creek or wherever you&#x27;re at. It&#x27;s convenient and does not take up a lot of room.&lt;br /&gt;i would even say that if you&#x27;re looking for a unique product to give at homeless shelters or food pantries, why not buy some of these so they can hand them out to homeless to use when they&#x27;re not able to get near a shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like i said, the product works, but it requires &amp;#34;circumstances&amp;#34; where this would be used mostly.</li>
    <li> These thick, soft washcloths are wonderful, and deserve to be called washcloths, rather than just wipes.  I had put the package in my car because it&#x27;s when I&#x27;m out and about that I need a disposable washcloth.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I and my son were moving my Christmas stuff from his garage to my house.  The boxes and tubs were very dirty and our hands were filthy when we finished loading.  We wanted to stop on the way to my house to get something to eat but our hands were too dirty to even walk into a restaurant.  Then I remembered the washcloths.  It took only 1 cloth each to do a wonderful job. We didn&#x27;t even feel a need to go into the bathroom and wash them again, although we did use hand sanitizer after the dirt was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these will be great for camping as well.  I will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I like to walk two miles every day during lunch at work.  Sometimes, especially if the weather is very hot, I come back extremely sweaty.  There are no shower facilities in the tall office building in which I work.  I simply lock myself inside a toilet stall and wipe myself down with one of the EasyBath Thick Disposable Washcloths.  They are easy to use.  Because they are unscented, they don’t offend my coworkers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The EasyBath Thick Disposable Washcloths don’t sting my sensitive skin like many disposable washcloths.  They simply leave me feeling refreshed and ready to begin work again.  I love these and highly recommend them for anyone who enjoys exercising but can’t take a bath or shower afterwards.  I plan on taking these the next time I go camping with my roommates, Bill and Sue.  These would make excellent Christmas stocking stuffers for the sports enthusiast in your life.</li>
    <li> I you&#x27;re a camper or hiker these disposable wet cloths will come in handy.  They can be used at ambient temperature or I&#x27;ve wrapped them in aluminum foil and sat them next to the campfire for a few minutes after supper to warm up a bit (be careful of the temperature - they may get too hot and steamy).  They are the perfect freshen-up for hands and face after a hearty out-of-doors meal in the wilderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large size and thickness makes them very efficient for most clean-ups.  They are unscented and the rinse-free formula is pH balanced, hypoallergenic and alcohol-free. They&#x27;re perfect for small children but an adult may need more than one if using them for a full buy wash-up. They should not be flushed</li>
    <li> These are thick, strong wet cloths that come five to a package.  They do a good job of cleaning, but I see these as something to put in your \\&quot;emergency kit,\\&quot; not as something to use on a regular basis.  I can definitely see the value if you have kids and they get into a mess when you&#x27;re away from home somewhere.  They could also be handy during times when there&#x27;s a water main break and your water is out for several hours, which, unfortunately, happens five or six times a year in my area.</li>
    <li> These disposable washcloths are a convenient way to clean without soap and water.They are thick and moist. They are larger than I anticipated, about the size of a small washcloth and bigger than a baby wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes clean well. My problem is that they are soapy and really need to be rinsed after using. But they are made to be used in place of soap and water. So when we use them, we don&#x27;t have water handy, and they leave a soapy feel and residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a good idea that doesn&#x27;t really carry out well.</li>
    <li> Wow, am I ever glad I had the chance to try this product!  I have a friend who is confined to bed for a while after surgery and these disposable washcloths will be a huge help for her.  I&#x27;m going to order some and take several packets to her next week when they arrive.  I also wanted to try these out because I know someone who is going to be leaving next Spring on a backpacking trip through Germany and Austria.  This product will be something I can tell her about because not only do they work, they also can fit into her pack without taking up much room at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the washcloth by starting at my face and ending up with my feet.  It only takes one cloth which is premoistened, hypoallergenic, latex free, and about the size of the fabric washcloths I use in my bathing (actual measurement is 8\\&quot; x 8\\&quot;).  These are a little bit cool at room temperature but not enough that it made me want to warm it in the microwave.  I was surprised at how quickly my skin dried after using the cloth without any soapy or sticky residue at all.  I also don&#x27;t notice any drying of my skin beyond what I normally have.  The \\&quot;bath\\&quot; keeps me fresh until the next day.  If someone is bedridden I&#x27;m sure they will be able to use these disposable washcloths every day for a long time without having to get into a shower or tub.  The package says the cloths cannot be flushed in a toilet so I just throw my used cloth in the trash.  One use per cloth may sound like a waste, but if you can&#x27;t get out of bed for a daily bath or even camping in the woods in a tent, I think the convenience will trump the feeling of wastefulness.</li>
    <li> I gave these to my grandmother who had a hip replacement two years ago and though her shower stall is equipped for the mobility-impaired, she sometimes finds it hard to shower everyday, but she still sponges off daily. These were perfect for daily cleansing and unlike other brands we&#x27;ve tried over time, didn&#x27;t leave her skin feeling sticky. I tried one as well and loved how refreshing the clean felt overall. Definitely plan to purchase Easy Bath for those RV road trips.</li>
    <li> These are soft, thick and really easy to use. I used them on a stinky boy who was waaaay too active on the playground and at PE. (Luckily I went to the PO before picking him up from school!) I used the warming option and found that 30 seconds was just fine for making sure he wasn&#x27;t too chilly while being wiped down. (For me though, I would warm them a bit more.) He smelled much better and one cloth was enough to do his whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s safe though to reheat the others in the package now. I only used one, but the instructions said to heat the whole package at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering these for my emergency supplies boxes. They do cost more than baby wipes, but they are also better quality and better for cleaning a whole body. I never knew these existed before, but I&#x27;m glad I got to try them and will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick cloths, the texture reminds me of felt fabric.  The liquid made my skin a little tacky feeling while wet, but it dried fairly quickly on my skin without leaving a residue feeling.  The package they come in is resealable, which is very handy.</li>
    <li> These are excellent for big messes, but a little too large to use as a &#x27;wet nap&#x27; type of cloth. (They work fine, just overkill.) Great for someone dining out with a toddler!</li>
    <li> These have a multitude of uses. . . . Great for camping. .  .Travel. .  .. Kids outings / field trips. . . . Anywhere water might not be readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, it&#x27;s nice that you can microwave them. . . but. . . if you have access to a microwave, then you should have access to water and a washcloth, so they would not really be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can certainly \\&quot;feel\\&quot; that I have used one.  The product advertises that there is no \\&quot;soapy residue\\&quot;.  Well, the residue might not be \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; . .  .but there is a residue.  But again, if you&#x27;re out in the middle of nowhere using one of these is probably preferable to nothing at all.  But now I&#x27;m going to go take a shower after using EasyBath because I just can&#x27;t stand the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the word \\&quot;bath\\&quot; is a HUGE stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I much prefer Wet Ones, though they are in kind of a \\&quot;different league\\&quot; than the EasyBath product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0043D68YW Wet Ones Antibacterial Hand Wipes Singles, 24-Count (Pack of 5)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0045XDGZ4 Wet Ones Antibacterial Hand  Wipes Travel Pack, 15-Count (Pack of 12)(colors may vary)]]</li>
    <li> These cloths are noticeably thicker than your standard wipe - more durable, and better for larger jobs, whether it&#x27;s a post-gym wipe down or cleaning up messy kids. They&#x27;re also enough larger and damper than any other wipe that I&#x27;ve that used, that you really only need one per job, which is a bonus. Super nice for a gym bag or travel days when you&#x27;re stuck in a car or a plane for long hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that they&#x27;re unscented. It makes them more discrete, and is reduces worries about where you take/use them, give that so many people are sensitive to scents these days. I also thought that the 5 count pack was a good size for these - it makes the package really compact (as opposed to baby wipes, which tend to come in much larger packages), so it takes up little space in a bag, but still gives you enough that you&#x27;re not refilling/grabbing a new pack too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that stood out to me is that these are really intended to fill a specific niche. Standard baby wipes can be interchangeably used for all kinds of things - a quick wipe down of sticky surfaces inside your car, a crazy dusty desk at work, etc. These are really too big and too damp to be used for purposes like that. Everything about these is geared to being a &amp;#34;disposable washcloth&amp;#34;. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, these are perfect, but don&#x27;t try to sub them for most of the things you&#x27;d use baby wipes for, because they won&#x27;t be a good fit.</li>
    <li> The EasyBath Thick Disposable Washcloths are great!  They deliver exactly what they promise.  Recently I was on a road trip too the mountains.  My friend worked on a lawnmower and got filthy.  He used them and they cleaned him right up.  I was just feeling filthy after some cleaning at a house where the pipes burst and I was thankful to have these.  They are soft and plush feeling without feeling flimsy.  You can be rough with them and they don&#x27;t tear easily.  The size is great.  They are just big enough to get the job done.  The amount of moisture is just right.  They don&#x27;t feel like they need to be rung out and they aren&#x27;t too dry.  I think that it is also great that you can microwave them if you&#x27;d like a warmer cloth.  The package is an easy resealable plastic with the sticky peel back cover.  My friend loved that they weren&#x27;t scented because he hates the smell of baby wipes.  Which is what I usually to keep on hand .  I will always keep these in my truck and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> This morning Mom fell out of the tub before she could wash herself. As she sat on the bathroom floor waiting for the EMTs to arrive I popped these into the microwave and she bathed herself. Very satisfactory.</li>
    <li> These are great, disposable washclothes equally useful for both adults and small children. They are large and thick, and are pre-soaked with an unscented, rinse free solution that is thoroughly wet but not to the point of dripping. As an adult, I use it to cleanse and refresh myself after a long, intense exercise. I often keep a pack of these in the car handy for the special occasions when my kids make a mess of themselves after a game in the field, or when I have a flat tire to change. I also plan to use these in our next summer camping trips. They are much tougher than the regular diaper wipes and can withstand abuses without falling apart. They can be a real lifesaver in a messy situation.</li>
    <li> Much thicker and stronger than the baby wipes that most people use camping and on the run. Great for older children on bust schedules and the moms responsible for keeping them clean.</li>
    <li> great to have on hand for quick clean ups.  The cloth is very strong and about the size of a washcloth, perhaps a little smaller.  It cleans well and is great to have on hand when you cannot have a full bath or shower.  I can see using it when you are out somewhere and cannot get to a bathroom or any type of sink.  Very convenient.</li>
    <li> I can see these being handy while traveling on a fairly long car trip or airplane trip with a child.  I don&#x27;t think they are a very good value honestly.  I used to presoap cloth wash rags when we traveled with our daughter and when we needed a quick wipe down I just used some water from our water bottle (we always had water bottles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use these for my pets though for after the dog park, etc. because I would prefer something disposable for that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These washcloths are microwavable but be really careful to check for hot spots before use because they don&#x27;t heat evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money to spend on disposable things like this then they are convenient and I say go for it.</li>
    <li> These are so handy to have. They are large, soft, thick and leave behind no residue, no lint, and no unpleasant smells. Once I tried them, I was wishing I had them when our power went out for 4 days last winter during an ice storm. I had been using baby wipes and went through tons of them. We have well water, so with no power, we also had no water. We had to make do with the baby wipes in order to clean up some. These EasyBath wipes would have been much more useful and less wasteful. They are so thick and if you want to, you can even rinse them and reuse them. They are not thin wipes and will not fall apart or shred. They are soft enough for your face and other sensitive areas, but also sturdy enough to give a scrub if needed. These would be great to have for beach trips, camping, when the kids play in the mud etc. Excellent product overall and the package does not allow them to dry out since it is recloseable.</li>
    <li> While not a replacement for a shower, this can be used to freshen oneself or others in a pinch. (There&#x27;s a term for that, but it&#x27;s highly inappropriate and contains &amp;#34;adult language,&amp;#34; so I won&#x27;t mention it.) For when you&#x27;re too lazy to bathe a kid, this is an acceptable hold-over. It&#x27;s nice to have while camping. If you have mobility issues, these are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are different from diaper wipes and such - they really are meant to be used like washcloths. They&#x27;re sudsier than diaper wipes, but the &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; stuff disappears rather quickly. Sized at 8&amp;#34;x8&amp;#34;, they&#x27;re large. I appreciate that they didn&#x27;t add any fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are too expensive to use like diaper wipes, but I&#x27;m going to take them when I go camping. There are five disposable washcloths in each pouch, but like most products resealed with a sticky flap, I expect this product to dry out somewhat quickly after opening, i.e. don&#x27;t expect it to be moist months later after they&#x27;ve been in the glove compartment.</li>
    <li> These disposable washcloths come in handy for so many uses. We have used them during picnics to clean up little faces and hands and of course during car trips.&lt;br /&gt;You could use these as a quick refresher during exercise, especially when out riding your bicycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They could also come in handy during an illness or if some injury has bedridden a member of the family. I have used these during hospital stays and they are wonderful, especially warmed up in the microwave - just like a warm bath.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could be swayed away from traditional baby wipes, which have a zillion uses. I kept thinking that a disposable washcloth was going to be a really, really thick baby wipe at many times the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EasyBath really changed my mind! They are incredibly handy cloths that really feel like a small washcloth. They&#x27;re so useful and so sturdy, you can do a ton with one, versus a handful (or more) of baby wipes. Best of all, no scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is also reasonable, and the packet size is just what you need when you&#x27;re on the go. I recommend!</li>
