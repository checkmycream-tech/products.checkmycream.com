      <li>I have been using  La Mer for many years and quite frankly I find ROC to be a superior product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective without damaging my skin or stinging my eyes.</li>
      <li>This product has really helped me better than anything else I have ever used!!!</li>
      <li>Roc products generally enjoy a good reputation for efficacy, so I decided to try their eye cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream for about 3 yrs now and am always told I do not look my age of 55 but more like 45, so I guess it&#x27;s working well.</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>I love this eye cream -</li>
      <li>I sincerely like it much better.</li>
      <li>Been using this for about a month now and notice a difference for sure.</li>
      <li>LOVE the affordable price.</li>
      <li>I am still searching  for a product works 100% but this is ok found nothing else that works any better</li>
      <li>This is a great product that I used daily.</li>
      <li>The cream is non greasy but is smooth and soaks into the skin quickly for applying eye makeup.</li>
      <li>This product works very well, and it&#x27;s the best cream you can find for dark circles.</li>
      <li>People remark that I look so good, or so rested or much younger.  </li>
      <li>but this product is too much of something or too many things, makes my eyes puffy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but last a good while when used sparingly.</li>
      <li>The price is  low for the good quality it has.</li>
      <li>ROC brings outstanding skin care to an affordable and reasonable price range.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s affordable and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I have tried many creams for dark circles and overall this works best so far.</li>
      <li>At first I was unsure if the cream was working but after using for about a week I could already notice a difference.  </li>
      <li>I love Roc products, they are the only thing that work for me</li>
      <li>Feels good, could moisturize a little better, but maybe that is the tightening feeling, as my eyes don&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
      <li>Love the price been using for years i really do look 15 years younger</li>
      <li>After daily use for 3 months I definitely noticed an amazing change.  </li>
      <li>Good&lt;br /&gt;Quality for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended this!</li>
      <li>On the other hand I love the multi 5 in one night cream.</li>
      <li>Better than more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>Not great but seems to be a good moisturizer for the eye area.</li>
      <li>Keep some eye wash near where you put the rest of your creams, just in case you do get it in your eyes.  </li>
      <li>I also find in comparison to other creams this is lower in price and works better than more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>I wake up looking a lot more fresh and less tired than I had before using it.</li>
      <li>While i was actually very happy with my previous eye cream, Eluage from Avène, i wanted to find one that was less expensive.</li>
      <li>I find if you put a thin layer right where the dark circle line is and don&#x27;t rub it in too much it works pretty well.  </li>

<li> Although, this is not a total cure for dark circles...</li>
<li> Roc is one of the few products that actually works.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years for puffiness and dark circles</li>
<li> I know waste quite a lot on other brands</li>
<li> It seems they might be a little deeper.</li>
<li> Just a little hint.</li>
<li> Within a week of using this cream, the puffiness and lines and dark circles just vanished!</li>
<li> It does have a slight odor to it but not strong.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a few months after It was recommended by a dermatologist.  </li>
<li> it is not too heavy and it helps with my wrinkles.  </li>
<li> but it smells really strongly medicinal and bad!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never had this issue in the past with any eye</li>
<li> #34;your usual 76&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> I had crazy puffy eyes and dark circles due to sleep late nights and not getting the rest I needed.</li>
<li> I have reordered at least four times now.</li>
<li> I realize this is difficult to believe, and, I was always a believer in that you get what you pay for, but, in this case....</li>
<li> I was hopeful, now sad.</li>
<li> and I am very disappointed.  </li>
<li> I still have some puffiness but for me it is hereditary and I have horrible allergies.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for about 3 yrs now and am always told I do not look my age of 55 but more like 45, so I guess it&#x27;s working well.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a month now and notice a difference for sure. I wake up looking a lot more fresh and less tired than I had before using it. My girlfriend uses the same one and had the same comments.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time. Product is as good as described.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months after It was recommended by a dermatologist.  I have been using  La Mer for many years and quite frankly I find ROC to be a superior product. I realize this is difficult to believe, and, I was always a believer in that you get what you pay for, but, in this case....well...it is a bargain.</li>
    <li> Not great but seems to be a good moisturizer for the eye area.</li>
    <li> Although, this is not a total cure for dark circles...it helps. If you use it properly and regularly you will see a difference.  It does have a slight odor to it but not strong. Any scent it does have goes away and is not noticeable.  I find if you put a thin layer right where the dark circle line is and don&#x27;t rub it in too much it works pretty well.  I think letting it absorb into the skin is how to get best results. I have tried many creams for dark circles and overall this works best so far. I also find in comparison to other creams this is lower in price and works better than more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Love it.. This one does not burn around the eyes.. Works wonderfully .. I have used this for several years !</li>
    <li> This has been the only eye cream that made my eyes swollen! This eye cream has perfume its  probably the reason why my eyes get swollen. I&#x27;ve never had this issue in the past with any eye product.&lt;br /&gt; I will not buy this eye cream again. On the other hand I love the multi 5 in one night cream.</li>
    <li> Love the price been using for years i really do look 15 years younger</li>
    <li> Another great ROC product ladies for around the eyes.  (Beckie)</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without this stuff.  After daily use for 3 months I definitely noticed an amazing change.  People remark that I look so good, or so rested or much younger.  I&#x27;m 76 but have been told I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;your usual 76&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Roc products never disappoint me. Good&lt;br /&gt;Quality for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was using the regular RocC eye cream, &amp; then I ordered 2 of the Multi Correction 5 in 1 eye cream. I sincerely like it much better. Just a little hint. Keep some eye wash near where you put the rest of your creams, just in case you do get it in your eyes.  Using this in the AM along with the Olay roll on eye cream works wonders.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months and I am very disappointed.  I read how others see major results in a little amount of time.  I&#x27;m glad for them, however; I have not noticed any improvement at all!!  I was hopeful, now sad. 😢</li>
    <li> At first I was unsure if the cream was working but after using for about a week I could already notice a difference.  I still have some puffiness but for me it is hereditary and I have horrible allergies.  This product has really helped me better than anything else I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream - it is not too heavy and it helps with my wrinkles.  LOVE the affordable price.</li>
    <li> Roc is one of the few products that actually works.</li>
    <li> very good eye crème, ty</li>
    <li> Very strong!  I love Roc products, they are the only thing that work for me but this product is too much of something or too many things, makes my eyes puffy.  Wish I could return.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing eye cream. I had crazy puffy eyes and dark circles due to sleep late nights and not getting the rest I needed. Within a week of using this cream, the puffiness and lines and dark circles just vanished! It&#x27;s a bit pricey but last a good while when used sparingly. Highly recommended this!</li>
    <li> While i was actually very happy with my previous eye cream, Eluage from Avène, i wanted to find one that was less expensive. Roc products generally enjoy a good reputation for efficacy, so I decided to try their eye cream. It seems to be working well - no complaints about that - but it smells really strongly medicinal and bad! I&#x27;m not going to throw it out but I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The cream is non greasy but is smooth and soaks into the skin quickly for applying eye makeup. Definitely evens your skin tone.</li>
    <li> Great products.  Better than more expensive brands. Save your money. I know waste quite a lot on other brands</li>
    <li> Feels good, could moisturize a little better, but maybe that is the tightening feeling, as my eyes don&#x27;t feel dry. Only been using a month or so no improvements to eye area noted. My dark circles are still dark, and of course I still have lines. It seems they might be a little deeper.</li>
    <li> This product works very well, and it&#x27;s the best cream you can find for dark circles. The price is  low for the good quality it has. I&#x27;ve been using it for years for puffiness and dark circles and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having good results from this eye cream.  It has smoothed out the wrinkle on my upper eye lid.  I would recommend trying it for sure!</li>
    <li> I am still searching  for a product works 100% but this is ok found nothing else that works any better</li>
    <li> This product smells like men&#x27;s aftershave and I don&#x27;t like that.  RoC Correction Eye Cream works better and is less expensive.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I used daily. It&#x27;s effective without damaging my skin or stinging my eyes. I find it reduces redness and puffiness and my eyes seem brighter and clearer due to the way the skin looks around my eyes. It&#x27;s affordable and worth every penny. I have reordered at least four times now. ROC brings outstanding skin care to an affordable and reasonable price range.</li>
    <li> I ended up buying this product from Rite Aid &amp; not this seller. I have used this lines retinol eye cream w/no problems but something about this eye cream gave me a rash. I ended up returning it.</li>
