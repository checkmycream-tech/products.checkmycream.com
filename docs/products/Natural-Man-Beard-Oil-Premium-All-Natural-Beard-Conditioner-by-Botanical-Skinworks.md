<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the product is great. Flaking (how embarrassing) disappeared immediately with the first application. I apply a very small amount daily and that does it. My curly beard also feels a little softer and never seems to itch now.</li>
    <li> This oil is light with a great natural fresh scent. The pump is very convenient, and the size makes this the best value. I use a little more than other, heavier, beard oils, to get good coverage.</li>
    <li> This oil is okay, but I had to apply it several times a day for any success.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, Everyone I meet love it as well, which, lets be honest makes it alot better all around! Easy to use, big bottle will last you on top of the great price! I should sell this stuff!!</li>
    <li> for the money I feel this oil is the best there is for a beard</li>
    <li> Smells nice, though maybe a bit strong on the mint. My beard always feels soft and is much more manageable after using this beard oil.</li>
    <li> If you want to feel and smell like a man, use this beard oil.</li>
    <li> Not greasy and absorbs in very quickly.  Beard feels great and I love the scent, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Product was received on time and I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I can already notice the difference. Excellent</li>
    <li> very effective, nice smell</li>
    <li> Product is as it was described.</li>
    <li> Good lime smell, effective oil and easy to use squirt bottle.</li>
    <li> This oil works well to condition and control my beard. People do notice the difference when I use it. It&#x27;s not at all like wax so if you&#x27;re looking to shape, this wont do. It will soften and moisturize the hair to help control it when you comb it, and makes it much easier to comb through. I took one star off for the scent but that&#x27;s a personal opinion and it&#x27;s not so off-putting that I wouldn&#x27;t use it but I might try something else after this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> Love the product and their customer service is beyond expectations.</li>
    <li> I ordered this last year as a birthday gift for my husband and he has used almost the whole bottle! This is my second bottle and it remains our favorite. It has a great scent and makes his beard soft and shiny. He also get dry skin on his chin, which causes it to be itchy, and this helps prevent that from happening! Packaging was fine, a little leaked in shipment, but they double bagged the product, so it was contained in the inner bag!</li>
    <li> Right away I felt a big difference.  Beard much softer and stopped flaking! Scent is a little strong when you first apply but it quickly subsides!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he has an awesome beard, but it is very dry. The smell is pretty strong and not very pleasant. It also gave my boyfriend a rash because he has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great scent and keeps the beard conditioned and soft.</li>
    <li> Smells like peppermint. Smoothes stray hairs and softens my beard.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I use ~5 drops every time, or it wouldn&#x27;t get into my beard</li>
    <li> Feels good smells good</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes it.  It helps to control his crazy beard, plus I like the smell.  Much better than the wax he was using, I could not stand the smell of that, it smelled stale to me.  This has a pleasant lime smell, not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> My husband only grows a beard in the winter time and he uses it about 50% of the time.  Nothing special.</li>
    <li> Sesame oil with a bit of scent, not really good, but it is cheap.</li>
    <li> love it, makes my beard look darker and it sparkles in the sunlight, nice price and last forever, you only need a little and it goes a long ways</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my son. He&#x27;s pretty no-nonsense, but likes it a lot. The fragrance was pleasant and both men and women gave it a thumbs up. He uses it a few times a week and says he enjoys the difference it makes in his beard as well as having the essential oils around during the day. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment and smells good.  I get more clove than bay lime, which was slightly disappointing as I wanted the lime.  Works into my beard well and does the job!</li>
    <li> I have a few different beard oils, and this one is the best everyday oil. Most of the other ones I use cost double as much and you only get 1oz.&lt;br /&gt;There are better beard oils out there, but they are going to cost you. This one is a great first beard oil, and great for everyday.</li>
    <li> Lime scent gets a little old after a couple weeks.  Beard feels oily all day with regular use, had to switch to once or twice a week so my skin wouldnt have issues.</li>
    <li> Best value per ounce of all the beard oils out there. Smells great on its own, spicy at first then mellows to a nutty scent over the day. I use this, then some pomade to keep the beard together, and a different, stronger beard oil on top.</li>
    <li> Really digging the scent and way it makes my beard feel. Hoping with more regular use it&#x27;ll get even better as other reviews have stated.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference with this stuff, it&#x27;s extremely greasy/shiny initially then doesn&#x27;t have any effect after it dries.  It doesn&#x27;t control stray hairs or anything like a balm does, and the smell dissipates within about 10 minutes so I don&#x27;t even know the point of this stuff honestly..?  Unless you have extremely dry face skin then I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this stuff, it is the no better than the oils that your hair glands naturally produce in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It arrived on time. package was undamaged. I have been using this since ive started growing a beard. Makes my beard soft and shiny. My wife loves it too. Said she can run her fingers through my beard and not get tangled in it. Supremely happy with this product and will order it again.</li>
    <li> Nice scent , long lasting , not greasy ,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not into colognes but this gives you a great scent that isn&#x27;t alcohol based and is subtle.  Great for your beard and skin.  I&#x27;ve had a dry skin problem on my elbow for several years and nothing would make it go away.  It would crack and bleed.  A few weeks of putting oil on it and it is mostly healed up.  A little dryness but no cracking or tenderness.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller. Leaves my beard soft with a nice bay lime scent. It fades after a while so I can still wear cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original bottle was damaged in transit and the seller provided a replacement very quickly! Didn&#x27;t even have to find a small box to ship the original damaged item back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and from TopGoods (the seller)!</li>
    <li> Me and my girlfriend love the smell. I have deep brown hair, this gives a strong vibrant color to my beard. Has a pleasant feel on the skin while applying it.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It feels great and smells awesome. Highly recommended. Your beard will feel fresh and smell fresh.</li>
    <li> I rarely review products but I had to share my experience with this beard oil.  I&#x27;m totally new to using such a product (haven&#x27;t grown out my beard for years) but man alive, this stuff is just as advertised.  My beard was stiff and wiry and after just two days of using this product, it has already softened my whiskers and rendered them more lustrous and healthy looking.  I like the scent too - it&#x27;s masculine, clean and herbal at once, plus it blends well with my bay rum aftershave.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Normally I prefer unscented products since I&#x27;d rather use a cologne than try to coordinate scents between various products but I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. I like the bay lime scent. It&#x27;s nice, not too strong, and doesn&#x27;t last too long. The oil works well enough, smoothing and softening my beard and preventing beard dandruff. Hard to argue with the price. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the bottle, which is plastic instead of glass, but obviously they had to save money somewhere to keep the price low. I hate the spray applicator. I&#x27;m not going to just spray it on my beard/face and spraying it on my hand causes the oil to splatter elsewhere. I&#x27;d rather have an eye dropper or even a flow limiter instead.</li>
    <li> Works great! Makes my beard shine (my wife says). Smells good too!</li>
    <li> this stuff smells good, leaves my beard and hair soft but not greasy and best of all is their customer service... I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews but it&#x27;s a good product and they followed up with one of the most genuine emails from a company I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty awesome. It comes in a huge bottle too. It should last for months.</li>
    <li> Smell is great. Light oil, not heavy. Second bottle I have ordered.</li>
    <li> If you want your beard to smell and feel amazing, buy this. My wife is loving the new beard aroma.</li>
    <li> I use this after my beard dries off after showering, for which I use Bluebeards Original Beard Wash with Extra Conditioning....that stuff works great.  After my beard dries I used this stuff to make sure my beard stays soft and controlled.  And this stuff works.  Also no funky scent, just a very pleasing smell that is not overwhelming at all that I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on. Now that my beard is getting longer using 3 pumps...but still works awesome.</li>
    <li> Smells great, and the bottle is much bigger than I expected! Great product for the price. If you do not want to pay $40 for beard oil, but you need something to control your beard, try it out!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, nourishes the skin, great masculine scent. Works for short beards and men of African descent too.</li>
    <li> the fragrance a little too strong</li>
    <li> Every time I buy this product, I buy an extra to give to anyone who complains about their new beard. This product will nourish the hair follicles so that your beard doesn&#x27;t extract what it needs from your skin. Which leads to dry and itchy conditions. As a result of using this &amp;#34;fountain of wisdom&amp;#34; in a bottle, you will notice that your beard will grow faster than a chia pet watered daily. Enjoy! #FearTheBeard</li>
    <li> Smells great, awesome application pump and you use surprisingly little of this, so I will have this bottle for a long time.  When I do finally use this up, I&#x27;ll probably reuse the bottle with some other brand oils, simply because of the application pump.</li>
    <li> Good oil with a great lime essential oil fragrance. It does claim to be organic. The only thing about the oil is that it does leave the beard slightly greasy. But for the price and quality I don&#x27;t mind . Use it at night to nourish your beard and moustache , by the time morning comes it&#x27;s been throughly absorbed and beard is nice and soft .i just use some beard wax to style.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days, but it definitely makes my beard feel softer.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;Natural Bay Lime&amp;#34;, it has a bit of a clove smell too. I usually don&#x27;t go for fragrances, but this one is really mild and nice.</li>
    <li> Helps keep the beard moist and lushus withb our dry heat in Arizona.</li>
    <li> Really dig this oil for beard and nails.</li>
    <li> easy to use + smells good, i believe its enough for a month or two, its pretty big bottle</li>
    <li> Right off the bat, the smell is kind of off putting for me. I can&#x27;t quite place what it is I&#x27;m smelling.  It&#x27;s not Bay.  It&#x27;s not Lime. It&#x27;s not Rosemary, it&#x27;s not Sandalwood. And, it&#x27;s not Sesame, or Jojoba. Or is it the mix of all of them making it funky? The smell dissipates after a while (or maybe I just get used to it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW: After having this for a bit now; it IS actually softening my beard!! That&#x27;s what I want it to do! I did have 4 people compliment me on my beard the other day while i was strictly using this product; You guys might actually be on to something! I actually put it on after a morning shower and at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the comment. I won&#x27;t return this, but I&#x27;m glad to know there is an unscented version and will probably go with that when I need to.</li>
    <li> First, the smell is glorious. My beard is rather large so I have to use quite a bit of oil &amp; have to smell it all day. This stuff smells so great I am always a bit tempted to get carried away in applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works great in conditioning the beard and skin. Gives the beard a nice shine and helps keep it under control.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this oil! Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Definitely a great smelling product, leaves my beard feeling soft and smelling great!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works pretty good when your in a pinch. I enjoy the price and the ease of using the pump rather than a dropper. Not the longest lasting product when applied but the fact that it is such a large amount, when compared to other beard oils on the market, theres plenty that will allow for extra applications.</li>
    <li> I have a short beard. Works really well and I enjoy the aroma very much so. Not greasy at all.  Easy to wash off beards or hands after use.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way it tames the beard. Really happy with it!</li>
    <li> This does help to maintain some control, but my beard is very course and curly, so it does not help a whole lot. It does however give my beard a nice healthy sheen and the smell is good and woodsy, not girly or for the metro-sexual type. I would recommend this product to anyone with a beard, and it may even help if your beard is fine, to keep it tamed down!</li>
    <li> smells great&lt;br /&gt;softens my beard&lt;br /&gt;a little bit goes a long ways&lt;br /&gt;bought one for myself and one for my bro- he feels the same as me about this product</li>
    <li> My only complaint, and it is a petty one, is that the size of the bottle is too large.  The product itself is outstanding, with a clean masculine scent, not overpowering or cloying in the least.  Conditions my tough beard after the first use and even works very well when rubbed into the hair on my head.  If the bottle were smaller, I could stash it in my dopp kit more easily for travel though.</li>
    <li> The best thing (speaking as a wife) is that it smells good.  It is good stuff, but not quite as good as coconut for softness of the goatee.</li>
    <li> At four ounces, this should last a beard for a good while. It absorbs well and leaves little greasiness. So well, I often feel compelled to apply some more than half way through the day. The scent reminds me of fir trees. It is refreshing, but is really strong on application. The scent does not linger too long though and is mostly gone in a few hours. I find this oil to be a real value and use it a lot. One small caution, the pump has pretty good fire power. When you spray some into your hand be sure to cup around it a bit or it will splash out of your hand.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My beard is healthier and I&#x27;ve noticed the growth of my beard has increased since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> My beard is very coarse and my wife hates it. With the oil, it makes a noticeable difference-- she doesn&#x27;t complain when being in contact with my face. Let&#x27;s call that a win.</li>
    <li> While this particular product is a little pricey, it works wonders.  The skin under my beard gets very dry during the winter and this product is great to keep my skin moisturized.  It dries, unlike other products so your beard doesn&#x27;t get oily.  Also, the smell is a plus.  Only need a little bit every few days so one bottle normally lasts a while.</li>
    <li> Good oil. Smells a little earthy, but not bad.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  If you have a beard or any kind of facial hair this is a must have!  It feels great on the hands, face and scalp.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff but unfortunately the selled didn&#x27;t package mine well and I lost 50% of it. Better off searching somewhere local for it. Not worth $20 after shipping, especially if they don&#x27;t package well and it leaks all over like mine did....</li>
    <li> It softens the beard with no greasy residue.  I got it because I was getting a little frizzy.  I took care of that quickly, with no indications of oiliness.</li>
    <li> works pretty good.  I bought this because I read it had the best smell.  It smells ok but my wife&#x27;s not crazy about it.  As for control it&#x27;s a pretty good oil for beard hair and helps it stay under control</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. Smells nice. Don&#x27;t expect a miracle though</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product, and it does make my wiry beard softer.  It is definitely not for styling, but for making my beard softer and easier to manage, it is wonderful</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I followed the directions on the label and massaged the oil into my beard. I noticed on the same day that my beard was softer and more manageable. The lime scent is very nice as well.</li>
    <li> Product works well, wife likes the smell, and the price was fantastic. Shipped quickly, and I will purchase again. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells good and my sweetie likes how it softens my beard. I am on bottle #2 and will buy again. This is a good company to deal with. Good customer service when there was an issue. I didn&#x27;t know that beard oil could make my facial foliage so happy.</li>
    <li> This product works even better on your skin!  It leaves my hands feeling so smooth that I have to love it!  But don&#x27;t get me wrong because it does work fantastically good on my beard and hair too!  I love it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The smell is very intensive and for me pleasant but i can imagine that it might be offensive for someone else.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the feel of the conditioner after continued use, but after one use I decided I was not going to be using this anymore for one simple reason, the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever walked in to Michaels/Hobby Lobby, that is the smell which this puts on your face, eau de craft store.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  I have reordered it several times now.  It works well, and smells great.</li>
    <li> Good product and works as advertised</li>
    <li> This is a great product. All ingredients are 100% natural seed oils and essential oils for fragrance. Really can&#x27;t beat the value because it is a generous supply. I don&#x27;t think I&amp;#34;ll need to buy anymore for 6 to 8 months at least. A little goes a long way. The fragrance is pleasant and is citrus based. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth in the morning. I use it overnight after shaving, skin heals wonderfully. I also use it as a personal beard area and face moisturizer. In fact, I will even use on my hands and feet sometimes because its just a good all around moisturizer. (the bottle says to use whatever extra remains on your hands on your scalp, elbows, and cuticles for example. Would definitely buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product in nice, protective wrapping. So far, my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the smell of this product. When I use it my beard is soft and my face feels hydrated. The oils used are great and I like that it has essential oils in it.</li>
    <li> I have long used bay rum aftershave/skin conditioner.  This beard oil fits well with that scent.  Light scent, not too strong, not too greasy, all in all a great product for all of your beard maintenance needs :)</li>
    <li> This year, I decided to let my beard just grow.  I am lucky that I am able to grow a nice, full, bushy beard.  But at a certain point, said beard starts to get unruly.  Doing some research, I saw several mentions of beard oil and decided to give it a whirl.  To me, for what it is, all beard oils are expensive.  So I guess this one is &#x27;reasonably&#x27; priced for what it is.  It has a pleasant, outdoorsy/spicy fresh scent.  Masculine but not overpowering.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, but I find I need more than is suggested and it doesn&#x27;t get my beard as soft or manageable as I&#x27;d hoped.  That being said, this being my first use of beard oil-I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to make my beard super soft and manageable or just help it look shiny, be semi soft and semi manageable.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again as I have discovered coconut oil does pretty much the same thing (if not a tad better) for much, much less.</li>
    <li> I like using this to tame the craziness that is my beard. I enjoy the smell enough but if you are not a fan of the smell of sesame then don&#x27;t get this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
    <li> I have over a years worth of whiskers on my chin and beard oil is a must. I have tried and use a number of beard oils on the market. This is my least favorite. It is a very very strong scented oil. Almost too strong. Imagine pouring cheap margarita mix on your face and having to smell it for a few hours. It is also super greasy. A small amount goes a long way. I have a feeling that whoever makes this jumped on the beard oil bandwagon and don&#x27;t actually have a beard, because if they did they would see this recipe needs some major tweaking. On a positive note, it is one of the cheapest beard oils on the market and you get a larger amount than most others.</li>
    <li> To quote Rocky: \\&quot;it makes me smeel mainly\\&quot;! Seriously, this product helps control my unruly hairs and gives a nice sheen to my beard without looking greasy. Not sure why some don&#x27;t care for the smell but (my wife and) I actually like it. I only wish the fragrance lasted longer. I use it every day and expect the 4 oz bottle to last the better part of a year.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because of the description of ingredients and love it. It gives my skin a softer feel and helps keep the &amp;#34;itchiness&amp;#34; to a minimum. It also help with the keeping my beard manageable to comb through and keep looking good. One other thing is the smell...very manly!</li>
    <li> Love it! Great scent but it doesn&#x27;t linger which is nice being a guy. It works great if you&#x27;re a smoker and don&#x27;t want to stink</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for a couple of months, and my use of it has dwindled down to once every couple weeks.  I started off using it every single day.  It was the first beard conditioning oil/wax I had, and I was very excited to tame the bristles on my face to a kissable, yet applaudable level.  The bottle recommends just a couple pumps of oil for your face, but of course it doesn&#x27;t give you any idea what size beard two pumps would accommodate.  I started off using just two, but felt like it didn&#x27;t adequately moisturize my face pubes (beard is only six months old and has been trimmed once - pretty thick but not much longer than my face).  So I started using three pumps, then four pumps, and then started using this product twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, it&#x27;s a decent conditioner.  It does take a while for the oils to be absorbed, and if you talk on your cell phone or lay down on a pillow up to an hour after you apply, you will leave behind some oil residue.  After a few weeks, I can say that my beard was generally slightly softer, but not tamed in any way.  I have curly hair, so my beard hairs are a little wild and coarse.  I was hoping this product would relax my beard, making it look bold and presentable, but it did not.  It only did two positive things: 1.  Soften it slightly through its conditioning and  2.  Make it shiny, at least for a few hours until it vanished from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some complain of the smell.  I enjoy it, but my lady does not.  It&#x27;s a hard smell to describe, so I&#x27;ll leave that as the mystery it has become through the conflicting reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you also have a wild beard, like the mane of a lion or the hairs of a porcupine, this will not suffice in providing you with any structure.  I&#x27;d recommend trying a beard moisturizing wax that claims to help with control and go from there.  However, if you have a dainty beard that has the soul of an oppressed Koala Bear, this will likely be an appropriate addition to your already mild and snuggly self.</li>
    <li> I posted a query to the Bearded Men/Women &amp; Children of Reddit, asking what I needed to know about my slowly blossoming beard and of the 1000+ replies, beard oil came up a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not entirely sure that I need it, since I use a natural skin moisturizer from Trader Joe&#x27;s I like - with sun protection - that I use on my head/face and sort of run my hands over the beard with it and I personally think that suffices. Still, I do use this about half the time after a shower (they recommend only 1 or 2 DROPS of it so why not?). I like that it seems to be all natural ingredients, if I remember correctly - and seems very old world, tried-and-true, and has an olde-tyme-y sort of smell to it that smells like something a grown-up with a beard would smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite a contrast to the more perfume-y Hermes, Prada, Armani types of colognes I have, and often don&#x27;t wear anything else with a smell to it, on the days I used this.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would help with stray hairs, but it only helps condition it. It is making my beard softer and smells pretty good, but not exactly what i was looking for to help with stray hair control.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin (beardruff) not to mention on my scalp as well. This not only took care of my beard but also took care of my scalp as well! Since this is DOUBLE the amount I usually purchase at HALF the cost it&#x27;s able to keep up with both my scalp and beard at a lower cost. I throw some on every morning and it keeps it smooth and smelling great. Not to mention it helps with those days you wake up and have a cowlick in your beard from your sleep.  Great product that delivers more for half the cost! Its really a no-brainer; give it a shot, your hair and skin will thank you.</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, my beard has gotten tougher and drier . . . with all that that entails.  I&#x27;d heard about this from someone else and decided the price was good (far less expensive than other products I investigated), so decided to give it a try.  Within days, except for the gray streaks, my beard felt like it did in my 20&#x27;s!  I was nervous about the lime smell, but it&#x27;s delightful and offers an invigorating touch when applying.  I won&#x27;t be without this again!</li>
    <li> The longer my beard hair gets, the better this stuff works. Think of it as a leav-in conditioner for your beard and face skin. It keeps mine much softer and prevents most of typical beard dandruff. It doesn&#x27;t leave any build up. It&#x27;s not a method for styling or shaping. The fragrance to me is not really that strong. I consider myself an unlucky member of the species whose nose is far too sensitive. I&#x27;m always the first one in a car to smell the oncoming skunk roadkill. This stuff does smell a bit like trix cereal or something, but it&#x27;s miled and pleasant and dissipates rather quickly. Today, I applied it about 7am. It&#x27;s not nearly 9 and I cannot smell it, nor can my co-workers. Essential  for No Shave November! (Don&#x27;t just grow it! Show your support for cancer research!)</li>
    <li> Really good product.  I was growing a beard for a no-shave November charity and the growth started to become unbearable.  I have a very coarse beard and very dry skin and needed something to help soften my beard and hydrate my face.  This oil smelled great and was light, but was not strong enough to relieve my dry skin or soften my coarse beard.  I may have a extreme combination, but if you have the same skin and hair issues I have, I suggest using Organix Moisture Restore Weightless Oil in combination with Healthy Sexy Hair Soy Tri-Wheat Leave-In conditioner.  After 2 days, my beard and skin were perfectly hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> Smells Great! makes my beard super soft. I recommend it to my friends all the time especially for Movember... I use it year round and my wife loves the smell.</li>
    <li> I have a very coarse full beard. When I kept it trimmed short, it wasn&#x27;t much of a problem. Now that I&#x27;m letting it grow out, the coarseness is more noticeable and troublesome. I tried hair conditioner, but the stuff that works great for the hair on my head does nothing for the hair on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realizing the hair is different, I started looking for conditioner/softener made for beards. I&#x27;m glad to say I found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 4 to 6 pumps per treatment, either to freshly washed and dried hair, or already-dry hair. It has a very pleasant lime scent and softens the coarse hairs. I recommend this for anyone with a beard.</li>
    <li> Its good stuff and after 4 or 5 days I do feel a difference in my beard. Its expensive but it works.</li>
    <li> Smells great and performs as well as other products I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a little easier to use since you don&#x27;t have to rub a paste between your hands to get it to a more liquid form.</li>
    <li> This is excellent. The price is also very good. The scent is pleasant and wears off after a short time.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, and I&#x27;m typically not a big fan of citrus. had to check it out because of the value, and It works just as well as any other beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;The pump is rather convenient, the lime scent is nice but not overpowering. I like how the branding is distinctly masculine, but it isn&#x27;t obnoxious about it like many beard products out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good product and good value, I don&#x27;t see where you could go wrong with this. unless you have a burning hatred of limes.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Get this stuff, you will love it.  Great price, packaging, and product.  Just started using this beard oil, which is my first purchase of beard oil since learning about beard oils on YouTube.  Other beard oils on the internet are very pricing in the $25 - $30 range.  This one is less than half that and about two to four times the size.  Heard complaints about other products being hard to get out of the shaker bottle, and others that have an eyedropper that has to be unscrewed. This bottle has a slick little pump on it - easy schpeazy!  This oil is rather light and not greasy in the beard.  It gives my beard a nice sheen to it and has made it softer and more manageable.  Nice subtle manly scent as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I like to use this about once every other day. After using it for about a month it keeps my skin moisturized and beardruff free while making my beard soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and how well it conditions my beard.  My only issue (while very small) is that it&#x27;s a bit runny, so you have to apply it or rub it in your fingers to prevent it from dripping quickly.  Although, there may be better ways to use it that I haven&#x27;t tried yet (i.e. put it straight on a beard comb, apply directly to the beard, etc...).  Great product otherwise.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product almost every day for three weeks now and I&#x27;m not really seeing an improvement in my beard. The only thing it&#x27;s good for at the moment is taming my wild hairs that have a mind of their own. Problem is, it doesn&#x27;t last long enough to do any major holding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A leave-in conditioner and beard wax do the trick for me.</li>
    <li> I like it...  two drops in my 2&amp;#34; beard works well, three is good when a little extra help is needed.  Does a good job softening and maintaining your beard.  The smell isn&#x27;t for everyone... I like it, the wife doesn&#x27;t...  it fades after a couple of hours so it&#x27;s not real noticeable.</li>
    <li> My beard is so soft and manly now.  It also smells delicious.  The ladies love it.  Mmmmm the ladies. :)</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend -- Good product for taming long beards --&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to bearded folks needing some taming.</li>
    <li> Granted this may be an age thing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 24 and this product caused me to have some acne. Haven&#x27;t been wanting to try it since.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and appeared to soften beard, but having zits is much worse than a rougher beard</li>
    <li> By far my best investment. It will last you a very long time. You just need one or two pumps if you have a small beard. I often had to use 3-4 due to my longer beard. If you use it with a comb it will help distribute it to all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend loves it, so it is a must!</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. He said it helps hydrate both his beard and his skin. And it smells pretty good too.</li>
    <li> It left my beard soft for sure.  It smells nice and clean, and managed the poof factor after showers.  However, after extended use it did seem to irritate my skin.  Not sure if it was the essential oils or what, but I have sensitive skin anyway and have to change shampoos for the same reason so I cannot blame the product.  When used occasionally and sparingly it didn&#x27;t seem to bother me.  And I really do like how it smells.</li>
    <li> I recently grew a beard and I was having the scratchy phase. I was ready to shave it off despite shampooing and conditioning it with good products.  I ordered a few beard conditioning items to sample them and this is by far my favorite.  Not only does it have a great scent, but it makes your beard super soft and manageable.  This is now part of my daily ritual and the best part is I the S.O. became a ravenous, beard-happy beast.. no joke!  :)</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Makes your beard/mustache soft and relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells like hot garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like my beard smelling like hot garbage.&lt;br /&gt;Hot garbage does not attract the ladies.</li>
    <li> This cold winter has made my (substantial) beard dry, stringy and pretty unhealthy.  Each morning I would need to clean the drain in the shower.  I was shedding more than both of my dogs combined.  After using this each morning after my shower, my beard is healthy, and I no longer am stopping the shower drain with errant beard hair.  I have even received comments recently about how much my beard has grown (in the last week or two) as it is causing the hair to lay down and be much less bushy.  I use about 6 squirts each morning, the scent is nice, and not really noticeable after about the 2nd or 3rd hour its on--and its really subtle after the initial application.</li>
    <li> This is my first beard oil purchase and I absolutely love it. It leaves my facial hair really soft and great smelling. It also leaves my face moisturized so it&#x27;s great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a great looking beard and a moisturized face. The smell is good, it&#x27;s a good hint of lime. Best way to explain it is it smells like wood cleaner with lime(lol) it smells good though. Even if you don&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s very subtle and goes away soon. Anyways, love the product and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this, and so do I. Now that the cold weather is creeping in, dry skin is always something to worry about. He puts a few pumps of the oil in his hand and massages it into his beard. Then he brushes it. It keeps the dry skin away, and it smells great. The citrus notes are pleasing. The good news is that this doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy mess. Seeing as a little goes a long way, we expect the jar to last a while too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, this is a quality product AND a great price! I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on the fragrance, and this beard oil covers nicely and gives my beard a supple, agreeable texture. I&#x27;m going to order another bottle, however I still have plenty left!  .</li>
    <li> First time using beard oil and I&#x27;ve got to say that I love it. It smells great and instantly make my beard feel softer and smoother. This is my first attempt to growing a full beard and I&#x27;m about 4 weeks in. The itching was extremely annoying but thankfully do to this product my beard and skin feel soft and clean. All you need is 2-3 drops and it does the trick. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> As I began growing my beard out past the 1&amp;#34;+ mark, it started getting itcy and I had some dry skin. This oil works great on short and long beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my beard was 2&amp;#34;+ over the winter, I put this oil in every morning (about 8-10 pumps of the container) and then brushed my beard. It helped keep my beard soft, cleared up the dry skin &amp; itchiness, and made it more manageable when combed. I began noticing the results after about a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve cut my beard down to only half an inch, I still put this oil in daily but only use about 4 pumps of the bottle now. My girlfriend would always complain about a shorter beard / stubble being itchy for her, but has actually commented on how soft it feels now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil does have a woodsy odor when you first apply it, but it dissipates after about 30 minutes and isn&#x27;t even noticeable anymore.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell neither did my wife.</li>
    <li> Smells great and gives my beard a great shine. This is also the first product I&#x27;ve bought that actually gets rid of my razor burn.</li>
    <li> This beard oil smells pretty good and it does make my beard and skin feel soft, however there are definitely better oils out there.</li>
    <li> Good smell in a light non-offensive oil.  Within a week I broke out in a rash.  After discontinuing everything and reintroducing one by one this turned out to be the culprit.  I lost my beard in the process.  I have sensitive skin.  If you do, give this a miss.</li>
    <li> works fairly well just a little greasy for my liking but for the price it&#x27;s an easy pickup</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Have been using it every 2-3 days for the last month and have become a big fan of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a full beard that i like to keep well kept around 1/2&amp;#34; to 3/4&amp;#34; max length for work reasons and had noticed over the winter that i have alot of &amp;#34;beardruff&amp;#34;, dandruff from my beard, showing up on my black polos at work.  It was a brutally cold winter so dry skin was rampant.  I have a shaved head and kept that moisturized with Aveeno and i still kept getting alot of white flakes on my shirts before i realized it was from the dry skin under my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looked around and found some popular brands had decent reviews and then i found this.  I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the scent of limes so i figured i&#x27;d give this a go.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Like most of the othe reviews here and on the net have stated, i apply when my beard is still somewhat damp, after taking a shower.  I&#x27;ll put four squirts of this on my fingers and then rub both hands together and apply it deep into the beard, running my fingers up from my neck towards my jaw and cheeks.  Do this several times and then run my fingers together again and work on the mustache area.  Has a nice lime scent mixed in with a few others that isn&#x27;t overpowering and wears off within a half hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month i&#x27;ve noticed a drastic decrease in beardruff.  If i go 4-5 days without using i notice it comes back but have gotten pretty good results using it every 2-3 days.  Also keeps my beard nice and soft and not as scratchy and scruffy which is an added plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all i&#x27;d say its a great investment and will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I always kept my beard trimmed low all my life I kept a beard but I decided to let it grow. I&#x27;ve always use oils and butters for conditioning my face but I found it a little tough to get down to skin after growing my beard. My wife recommend that I soak a cotton ball with oil and then dab my beard, found out that it works great. Little oily but works. As for this product I like the smell it reminds me of a school wood shop. I think that it has a good manly scent. It does make your beard look healthy its not that greasy its like wd40 in my opinion really no control with the whiskers but does make your beard softer if you apply it 3 or 4 times a day. I think this would be a good product for the really long beard guys because of the smooth finish it gives. But for you 1 inchers I would try some kind of African Pride oils(Coco/Shea/etc.) works better. Going for the Amish beard balm next.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and how smooth my beard feels.</li>
    <li> I like how far a few drops goes.  It has a pleasing smell to it that fades and is subtle on the beard.  Seems to make brushing my beard a bit easier.  Put a drop on my hands, rub them together, rub it into my beard, and then rake my fingers through my hair and call it good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. He loves it! He likes the smell and the fact it&#x27;s a pump.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Smells good, vaguely like a spicy lime. A lot of oil for the money. Good value. I may buy it again.</li>
    <li> It does seem to make my beard more soft and full. And it has a nice manly, woodsy smell.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  When I first used it I thought it was watered down from the beard oil I had been using, but it works just as well, and it since more comes in the bottle, it lasts 4x longer for the same price.  I don&#x27;t care for the scent, but the scent goes away after 30 minutes or so, and now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a month I don&#x27;t even notice that it has a scent anymore.</li>
    <li> I think this product has a nice smell. I didn&#x27;t think it smelled of hot garbage at all!! While its not going to soften any beard that is less than 2 months old, it does do a good job after a certain length and age has been reached . I like it.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This beard oil smells great. My wife loves it. It makes me smell like Key Limes. I get lots of compliments on it. It also helps keep my skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product compares to others since this is the first time I&#x27;ve rocked a beard, but I like how it eases the itchiness and makes my beard a little softer.</li>
    <li> Great scent, makes your beard look great. The dispenser bottle works great and it has twice the oil as most other brands you&#x27;ll see for the same price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet how well it is working, but with just a dab ran through the beard I can then free comb it. The beard itself is starting to feel smoother, but it could also be in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a bit of a lime smell to it that doesn&#x27;t stay around too long, but is very nice when putting it on.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the hopes that it would help tame my beard. I wasn&#x27;t expecting wax-like control but anything was better than nothing. It didn&#x27;t do much in that way but it smells nice and makes my beard feel softer. It also allows me to wash my beard a little more frequently without drying it out too much.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil for a few months now. I wanted to get some good everyday use before I posted my review. This is without a doubt one of the better beard oils i have used. My beard is currently around the 7&amp;#34; mark and i really needed something to help with my conditioning routine. After I blow dry the beard in the AM a few drops of this does perfect. It smells excellent and gives your beard just a little bit of shine. It doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of oily residue or anything like that. For the price, give this a shot. it is worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the product on my beard for a little more than a week and already I have seen some results. Along with the normal grooming and trimming I&#x27;ve noticed that my beard has become smoother and less scraggly. Definitely a helpful product for the curly beard</li>
    <li> I am please with this product which I use it to condition my beard in the morning.  The smell is pleasant and not too strong.  I like the fact that it is organic and comes in a descent size bottle.  Great product and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well and my wife enjoys the smell and appearance the oil provides. The pump works reasonably well and application is straightforward, though in my experience it leaves as much on your hand as it does in your beard and requires a thorough handwashing after application. But otherwise it does what it claims to do, and I certainly don&#x27;t mind the odor — it&#x27;s better than used motor oil.</li>
    <li> This is excellent stuff. Softens the beard and adds a nice sheen, but not overly shiny, look to the hair. The smell is very different, but  I absolutely love it (more importantly, my wife does too). My daughter thinks it smells like coke. She&#x27;s 4 so take that with a grain of salt, but I will say the spices used seem to be at least in the same family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY gripe is that it does leave a slight oil residue on your hair for a while until it soaks in really good. I dont know if it will stain clothing or anything, but it does make me wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hop out of the shower, towel mostly dry and apply this (two pumps only) with my hand and then brush through with a badger brush. It&#x27;s a very luxurious feel. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Been using this for a while now and my beard is much thicker. I&#x27;ve moved up to 4 pumps but still use it daily. I have had absolutely no beard dandruff and my beard is softening nicely. Still highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My husbands beard is pretty short so I was unsure how much he would actually use this stuff. Turns out it was a great purchase. It smells very nice and is very mild. His beard has gotten softer and smoother and it has just been a few days. I am very happy he likes this oil and will make sure he stays well stocked with it.</li>
    <li> I was watching the Today show when the hosts were dealing with the beards they were growing for the no shave November thing.  The barbers they had on there said that beard oil was the best thing to use.  I looked and couldn&#x27;t find any in the store here so headed to Amazon and found this.  It had the best reviews and the cost wasn&#x27;t bad so put in the order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves it.  Makes his beard nice and soft.  The bonus is it is also helping keep the skin underneath moisturized.  It tends to get red and irritated around the sides of his mouth in the winter but the oil has already made it all nice and soft.  The smell is nice and not too strong.  I highly recommend this for anyone with a beard.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to soften his beard. It works great. It was exactly what he needed. And I think it smells great! I love the scent. I will buy more when he runs out.</li>
    <li> Feels nice but the smell is just a tad too strong. Still use it every now and then to get that hippie feel.</li>
    <li> This is a nice oil.  The smell is different but not repulsive.  I have been using it daily for over a month and while it does make my beard more soft after application, I don&#x27;t see any lasting effects.  I was not really expecting them, but will probably try something different when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I returned it, the smell was very strong, and unpleasant. I bought this awhile ago, and I forgot what it smelled like, but people noticed it at my work and were very critical of it.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t feel too oily. Husband uses is and says that it made his beard a lot less itchy, and if he has any left over on his hands he just rubs it on his head.</li>
    <li> The smell and feel of this product is amazing I am glad I came across it so is my beard!</li>
    <li> Best beard oil I&#x27;ve found. Most oils/balms etc, smell so much like a ladies perfume, I have to wash it right off. The smell of one has an awesome, light, lime scent. Ordering more for sure. Makes my beard soft, gives it a great shine. Only problem is it makes me keep wanting to reapply more because of the scent! Actually works great on my course chest hair and pubic hair. Nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I started for a couple weeks just using 4-5 drops as instructed, didn&#x27;t really have any of the results such as manageability and softness. I started going to town...15ish drops. No change. It leaves your beard shiny and kind of wet looking, but in a couple hours it&#x27;s pretty much normal. In all fairness, I don&#x27;t know if anything will work but there you have it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of beard oils before. Probably 7 or 8 different kinds over the course of 6 months or so. This Natural Man has been my absolute favorite out of the bunch. Within a week of use my beard was softer than it had been from previous oils. No irritated skin. The scent is bit herbal or earthy but it doesn&#x27;t linger and isn&#x27;t unpleasant, it&#x27;s just not as &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; as from previous oils. I love the size of the bottle and I&#x27;ve grown to prefer the pump tip.</li>
    <li> Well, if you&#x27;re looking for a good beard oil to condition your beard for harsh environments, I&#x27;m sure this one will get the job done. However, it leaves you smelling like a hippie. Just received the package this morning - shipped quickly by Amazon. Tried it out before work...and should have taken another shower. This stuff has a strong smell. I&#x27;m sitting in my office and it&#x27;s all I smell. People probably smell it down the hall and think I just got back from the head shop. Anyway, like I said, I&#x27;m sure this stuff works well. I&#x27;m just not happy about the strong, un-manly scent. If women had beards, this oil would sell like hot-cakes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this beard oil for a little over a year and it is excellent. While not overpowering, It has a great smell and feels wonderful on my face and beard. people always remark at how soft my beard feels. You get way more product than most other beard oils as well so it last a long time. I highly recommend this oil to all bearded men everywhere</li>
    <li> Did not work well with my beard.</li>
    <li> This is my first use of a bear oil of any kind so I don&#x27;t have much to compare to. However, I am happy with the product. Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t linger like others have mentioned. The biggest thing for me is that it has reduced, and nearly eliminated my beard flakes! It also softens the beard a bit too. Can&#x27;t beat the price either considering most other oils are the same price for half as much. Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> The product is great overall and feels great on a freshly shaven face, especially when you haven&#x27;t shaved for going on 2 years but I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change to the softness of my mustache I grew for Movember. Will continue to use it as I grow my beard out again though to see if it helps. Also, while I don&#x27;t mind the scent, my girlfriend does and this is a significant detractor overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many oils, but I&#x27;m done experimenting; I&#x27;ll stick with this product. It smells great, works as well as the other brands of oil, but costs a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just not crazy about the smell.  It smells too much like a pine tree for me.  Just buy some Moroccan oil from walmart. Works and smells better and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product smells great but the nozzle squirts rather than sprays so distribution onto my beard doesn&#x27;t work well. It&#x27;s easier to squirt it into my hands and rub it in.</li>
    <li> Bought this a month ago for my boyfriend and his ever growing beard. This stuff smells amazing, without being over powering. It helps to tame the wild beast. Gives a nice shine to his beard without leaving it oily either. Also good for use on hands. Will be buying another bottle after this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Nice oil with a forest scent. Word fine till I shaved off my tiresome beard.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! Great subtle scent, keeps your beard feeling hydrated and healthy. Also relieves annoying beard itch. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I cant say if it work well or not because the first time i put it on my face was also the last time, it smells like stale pepsi...def not lime....</li>
    <li> Done better things for the beard than anything.</li>
    <li> Product is very good for the money.  Smells great, does a decent job of controlling those &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; beard hairs one gets.  Gives a nice shine to beard and is not very greasy/oily at all.  It absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this. The bottle is fairly small but a little goes a long way. Makes your beard feel silky smooth, non greasy and itch free. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells pretty good and adds a strange (bay lime) but pleasant scent to my beard, it is a nice addition for when ladies dig their hands in or get close.  It also does add a light shine and on itchy days it does seem to help with the irritation.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday but I am a fan and i&#x27;d suggest giving it a try.</li>
    <li> A great product, though best for those with longer beards. Lasts forever a great deal compared to others.</li>
    <li> I smell like a manly man</li>
    <li> great smell and leaves my beard silky and easy to manage. Small bottle but a little goes a long way.  I took off a star because I don&#x27;t think beard oil should cost $15.</li>
    <li> I purchased a few different beard oils to try recently, never used the stuff before. This one gave the best results and instantly a soft beard. The others are tossed aside and this is the one I will be coming back for</li>
    <li> Good product, but nothing entirely special. I tried a product from http://www.venerablegentlemensbeardco.com/ and was way more impressed. Would recommend venerable gentlemens.</li>
    <li> You results may depend on your hair (everyone is a little different), but for me it is great.  I have a bit of a course beard and the sides tend to get a bit wild.  This does a great job of taming a bit, gives your hair a nice sheen.  Don&#x27;t overdo it, start sparingly and add more until you figure out how much works good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I give it 4 stars is that it&#x27;s a bit pricy for a small bottle.  After reading the ingredients, it might be possible to make a homemade version, cheaper, but this is really good stuff (especially if you aren&#x27;t the do it yourself type), so I chalk it up to someone taking the guesswork out of making it for me.  My wife really likes it, too.  She says it has a bit of a clove-like cent, even though it&#x27;s bay leaves.</li>
    <li> I bought this formy husband for Christmas and he loves this. His beard used to be very scratchy but this softens his beard and smells great!</li>
    <li> Keeps them face-hairs smooth and soft, and as a bonus, you get to smell like you ran downhill through a thick forest of pine trees with a very-full glass of lime-aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 drops&#x27;ll do ya!</li>
    <li> If you want to smell like a MAN then this is the product to get.  It&#x27;s limey right off the bat then settles into a nice musky clove scent.  Beware it&#x27;s pretty heavy so only use two drops minimum and go easy on the &#x27;stache.  It&#x27;s not very greasy so it won&#x27;t leave a ton behind after using.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price of this beard oil.  Is the lime scent the best one on the market? No, but it certainly isn&#x27;t horrible either.  It&#x27;s similar to a fresh margarita, and works well on a nice summer day.  After it&#x27;s been in for an hour or so the scent wears off anyway ut the oil stays in and keeps conditioning your beard all day.  For half the price of their competitors, and 5x the volume ($30+shipping for a 1oz bottle), I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
    <li> I love tweezer man their products are really good and the scissors are phenomenal, sharp and perfect size, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because the comb is kinda flimsy but still useful.</li>
    <li> I read about beard oil and immediately sought to buy some. With no luck at local stores I looked on Amazon and purchased this product. It works great, my beard is softer and smells glorious. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This works well and smells great!  My girlfriend loves it and I think it really helps keep my beard looking good.</li>
    <li> It smells really nice.  Someone said it smelled like sesame.  I am not sure it really does much conditioning, but it does soften the beard while you have it on.</li>
    <li> I am close to 50 and taking testoterone shots which makes my beard very wirey...I bought this hoping that it would soften my beard...and it does, but, not as much as I hoped.  It smells good and makes my beard and hair very shiny and heathy looking.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate it higher is that it doesn&#x27;t condition my beard and hair as much as it really should...but, for some it might be enough.</li>
    <li> made me breakout under my beard.  Didnt like it.</li>
    <li> WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN...</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and smells good. The best part is it is all natural so no chemicals which is good for sensitive skin. They say 1-2 drops but that is way less than you probably will use. I use 4-5.</li>
    <li> Keeps my beard under-control!</li>
    <li> Smells good and works.  Makes it soft.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband, and it works very well. The smell isn&#x27;t over powering at all, and it leaves his beard soft.</li>
    <li> There are so many better oils out that than this. I bought this in the infancy of my beard and didn&#x27;t realize how many great beard oils are on the market! The is a decent deal for the amount you get (4oz) as most boutique beard oils are 1 oz. However, I would look else where for something with higher quality ingredients.</li>
    <li> As advertised &amp;#34;AMAZING&amp;#34;, This will be my beard oil till im layed 6ft under.</li>
    <li> Thought product was very good.  It worked as stated. Delivery was excellent. Recommend the product to anyone looking to soften their facial hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great and moisturizers, shines and detangles. Softens perfectly and the scent is not overwhelming. We will buy more! Try it you will like it, especially for dry beard hair.</li>
    <li> It says two pumps but I&#x27;ve found that not to be enough even though my beard is only a few months growth.  The scent is mild and it does appear to help keep the frizz manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure it softens my beard but it does smell great and makes my beard more manageable. Only one to two pumps needed for application so the bottle will last a while</li>
    <li> Great product!  Keeps my beard soft and gives it a clean and well groomed look with a slight sheen - not shiny.  The scent is fresh and light not strong and overpowering.  I highly recommend this product and seller!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. Within hours of first using it my wiry beard hair began to soften! The smell is also quite nice but it does not linger like a cologne. (You have to be in real close quarters to pick up the scent!) All in all, this is a wonderful product for any guy with a beard in need of some softener! Good luck!</li>
    <li> Great smell, leaves a nice shine on my beard, and softens it up a bit, but is a little oily</li>
    <li> As the name says it&#x27;s conditioning oil, not beard wax.  It does seem to help tame unruly hairs a bit.  Like plenty of other reviewers have said it leaves the beard soft and shiny and neither my girlfriend or myself mind the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells a bit limony and makes a super shiny beard. I Wish it had a more appealing smell but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Really happy with this product. Tried it on whim when buying some other beard stuff. The scent, though short lived, is excellent. Manly but not offensive, bright and citrusy with a distinct woodiness. Four pumps on a lush beard is quite a bit and the leftovers can be worked into elbows and hands which beats your wife&#x27;s oil of Olay or Jergens by a country mile. The organic aspect also really appealed to me as I&#x27;m trying to live greener when it comes to my body. My only real complaint is that I wish the scent was stronger and lasted longer as it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
    <li> got this for my boyfriend this christmas. a little goes a long way and there is still an almost full bottle 9 months later. it makes his beard super soft and slightly glossy. the smell reminds me of clove and makes the beast of man beard much more tolerable</li>
    <li> A great beard oil with a nice smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. The oil itself is excellent but I&#x27;m not sure if I am a fan of the pump style as you have to pump some into your hands and the directions aren&#x27;t accurate as to how many pumps you need. Still a fine product that helps make your beard nice and manageable regardless.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I have a thick, full beard, and wash it every morning.  I have a few different kinds of beard oil.  This is one of my three favorites.  Smells pretty good, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy in my beard, and keeps it under control.  It&#x27;s also a nice, big bottle, so at 4 oz, you won&#x27;t have to buy another bottle for a while.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping ordered Monday night was at my house Wednesday. The beard oil is great and I love the smell. The bottle is a lot bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for crazy beard for the price. My wife loves the smell and if you use this with a boar bristle brush you can fix any beard</li>
    <li> This delivers as advertised - light but effective at helping to control your beard without looking slicked down  - manly smell, softens beard and really helps reduce itching. I also bought Honest Amish Beard Balm. Honest Amish is a good product as well, but didn&#x27;t perform quite as well. One issue is the Honest Amish is a butter, so you have to guess how much to use and rub it till it liquifies. I prefer the Bay Lime Conditioning Oil.</li>
    <li> being new to the beard culture i purchased this to help soften the hairs so it wouldn&#x27;t irritate my neck. All this dose is make your hair feel oily and it smells god awful. My gf wont kiss me let alone sleep in the same room if i had this on.Luckily i had the bluebeards beard wash.</li>
    <li> My beard was totally awesome before using this product.  It was full, lush, and the envy of every man in the facial hair community.  This product gave my already stellar beard that extra shine and softness that puts it above the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can now remove lug nuts with my bare hands.  Thanks to this product, my beard now defeats bad guys just by the glow and shine.  If you are a man, have a beard, and want to kick it up a notch, this will do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 3 pumps in the morning and my face-fur is nice all day.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend d for Christmas and he loves it! It makes his beard soft and skinny and looks very well maintained. I love it because it smells so good! Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I grow a wild &amp;#34;Holly Moses&amp;#34;/Duck Dynasty style beard, combing/rubbing some of Botanical Skin Works men&#x27;s Bay Lime Beard conditioning oil in hels noticeably when it comes to managing my beard. It also tends to keep it less wirey and less dull (gives it a nice healthy shine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dinged one star because I wish it was unscented.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many other oils and balms but I am extremely pleased with this one. There is an extremely noticeable difference in softness in my beard between days that I do and do not use it. It&#x27;s part of my morning get-ready routine now. I&#x27;ll squirt three pumps in my hand (my beard is 6 months old, and 3 pumps seems to be the optimal amount for this length) and then use it to &amp;#34;brush down&amp;#34; my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good but not over powering, in fact after about a half hour, I don&#x27;t notice it at all - and my girlfriend enjoys the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that if your beard is 3+ months old, it&#x27;s time to start using oil and I highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and he Loves it. Smells and feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Lots of oil for the price. The scent takes a little getting used to, but it subsides quickly. Most importantly, it softens my beard and keeps my skin underneath moisturized.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to Amy one out there,....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget the fact that it smells very great.... It softens my skin too</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t soften my beard</li>
    <li> Really great product. Smells great. works the way you expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the packing is terrible. the bottle leaks when travelling. I have yet to find a solution to this problem. I travel a lot, so it seems I&#x27;ll have to switch brands solely based on this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for one day with two applications, but so far I like the scent (good but not great) and my beard is feeling softer and more manageable already. Hopefully it will continue to make it more manageable as I use it, it&#x27;s the first beard oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Great product the only issue I have is it has a very earthy scent not alot of lime but it dissipates quickly so it&#x27;s alright</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes your beard nice and soft and has a good smell to it. The smell is earthy, but I grew to love it! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The best stuff on the market. Nice refreshing scent, invigorating feeling, very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Does very little to keep hair in place, but makes beard softer and shiny.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. smells good and keeps the beard looking shining. helps with beard styling too.</li>
    <li> Smells good, keeps my beard tidy, and rubbing the excess into my hair before I comb it actually helps style it a bit. It&#x27;s pricey, but it should last a while. I trim my beard with a 10 guard, and two pumps is more than enough.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. It smells great and softens his beard. I can notice a difference in the softness of his beard. As well. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Need to tame the beast? Great product for the beard, the scent is very masculine, but dies down after about an hour, so your not smelling it constantly. I&#x27;ve noticed not only a more full beard after 90 days of application, but more vivid auburn coloration. Keeps the stray hair together, and a little goes a long way. One small squirt on the palms and your good for 24 hours, no oil residue, think &amp;#34;leave in conditioner&amp;#34; feel.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box it was shipped in both corners were coated in oil, the bottle was put in a zip lock type of bag and it had leaked out of the bottle AND out of the bag. It not only covered the other gift I had ordered in the box but the inside of the box. Very disappointed that not only was one gift completely ruined but in doing so it ruined the 2nd gift in the box!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little more oily than I would like but would definitely purchase again. Smells great and would recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days now so I&#x27;ll re do this review after another week or so.  My beard, new, is irritating the chin area as the hair feels so dry an coarse. I was hoping by adding this product it would soften it up some but so far I really can&#x27;t tell any difference.  It smells okay and is not overpowering at all.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it helps manage my beard. I apply it every morning when I get dried off from the shower. I put a few drops in the palm of my hand and rub my palms together vigorously, then rub it into my beard. I then massage my scalp with any residue that is left on my hands. This smells good and helps with beard and hair control. Adds a bit of a luster to beard. I think it smells good.</li>
    <li> Good product.  if you don&#x27;t like a &amp;#34;herb&amp;#34; scent, this is not for you...that being said i do like this product.</li>
    <li> I have now been using this beard oil for a little over a week, and I must say it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve grown a beard every winter for a couple decades now and usually shave most of it off come spring. Most often I leave the mustache and a goatee/van dyke. However, this year I plan to try leaving it to see how long I can grow it. Generally my beard hair feels dry and &amp;#34;straw like&amp;#34;, and my mustache gets all too many split ends. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried numerous standard hair conditioners with little positive result. This year I decided to try an actual beard product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first beard-specific product I&#x27;ve ever bought. At first I considered making my own beard oil based on recipes from the internet. However, a friend pointed out -- quite logically -- that it would probably be wiser to try a pre-made beard product first, to see what to expect and learn what works.&lt;br /&gt;He was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I was looking for in a beard product were, in no particular order: Smoothing and softening of my beard, a fuller and healthier looking beard, less itching, reduction and healing of split ends, more manageable and &amp;#34;tamed&amp;#34; beard and mustache, and enhanced growth characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say without reservation that this product has achieved 90% of these!!&lt;br /&gt;Within the first two days of use, my beard immediately became more manageable, and looked and felt heathier and fuller. Now, after a week of use, I definitely am seeing fewer-to-no split ends, almost no itching, far fewer under-beard zits, and FAR more manageable beard and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;The only lacking area so far is the beard smoothing and softening. While this product certainly has helped to a degree in that regard, my beard is still not as soft as I was hoping. However, perhaps I am simply expecting too much here. Having no basis for comparison, my beard&#x27;s texture simply may be what it is.&lt;br /&gt;Still, this product has indeed helped to soften and smooth my beard noticeably, so I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t work in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding enhanced growth, I certainly have not been using this beard oil long enough to make any comment as to its effectiveness there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have commented that they don&#x27;t like the smell of this oil (motor oil and onions one person said, another saying &amp;#34;Christmassy&amp;#34; smell) or that it is too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely say that I don&#x27;t experience this AT ALL. I find the smell to be pleasing and light, and that it fades within an hour. I don&#x27;t know WHERE people are coming up with the smells they&#x27;ve described either. It clearly smell just like what it says: Bay Lime, with a hint of sandalwood. I was actually surprised at how little sesame oil smell there is.&lt;br /&gt;To me, this oil actually smells a bit like something I might use as an oil painting medium; which is, to me, a good thing. I&#x27;m finding that the faint lingering scent reminds me of oil painting as may well influence me to paint more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would DEFINITELY recommend this product!!&lt;br /&gt;A couple things tho:&lt;br /&gt;a) For my beard it certainly taking more than the recommended 2 or 3 drops. I find I need around 5 squirts two or three times a day. However, given that this bottle contains 3 ounces of the oil for only 20 bucks (shipped), it will still last QUITE a long time for me. I&#x27;m guessing over half-a-year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) Upon advice from other beard-havers, and something which is not mentioned in the usage instructions, I&#x27;ve been applying the oil to my beard when it&#x27;s damp. This is to say right after a shower, or even after simply rinsing my beard good in the sink. I am finding that this oil works WAY more effectively using it this way. This, in my opinion, should be part of the instructions for the oil; .... DEFINITELY apply this product to a damp beard. It still works on a dry beard, but it works better on a damp beard.</li>
    <li> Botanical Skin Works Men&#x27;s Bay Lime Beard Oil is amazing.  My husbands beard has never been so soft and the smell isnt overpowering like many others.</li>
    <li> I chose it because it is organic. Nothing but the best for my beard. Thanks for everything. Gonna buy more</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was always getting breakouts and irritation from kissing me when I had stubble.  I looked on Amazon, read the reviews, and decided to give this product a try.  Despite the fact that my stubble is of the bristly, coarse variety, the bay lime formula solved the problem immediately.  Oh, and the scent is great too.</li>
    <li> Fear the beard!  The only minor complaint I have is the smell but it is not too overbearing.  I have been using this product for over a year now.</li>
    <li> I am just beginning to grow out my beard as I usually shave it off due to complaints from my wife and young daughter that says it is too pokey. This conditioning oil helps to soften up my early beard growth and keeps it looking healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It keeps my beard soft and smelling great. I really like the smell of lime however this has only a hint. With that said the smell in my opinion is great, not too strong either.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff  Update- 2 months into post u.s. Army beard and this stuff is amazing. I use it on my beard and hair.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works really well for my beard by helping both to condition the hair, and helping dry skin underneath the actual beard. I actually really dig the smell. It smells quite potently of lime mixed with a bit of a woodsy smell. I like lime though, for those who don&#x27;t, it may be a bit strong for you.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the thing, though; while it is strong, the scent does start to go away relatively fast (within 10 minutes it starts lessening), with it basically going away completely within the hour, but still leaving the beneficial effects of beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t like lime, I&#x27;d recommend this product. Especially if you&#x27;re new to using beard oil, it&#x27;s a relatively risk-free option, and a great product. I say this because at the price, when speaking comparatively with other oils, the value you&#x27;re getting is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;While a lot on the market go for 20 dollars or more for a 1 oz. bottle, this is a 4 oz. bottle for cheaper than that (I got mine for somewhere around 12.50 or so)</li>
    <li> This conditioning oil had me a little concerned since it was going to be all up in my olfactories. However, it not only was a light and pleasant scent but made my beard softer and shinier. It also helped stopped the itchiness of my skin underneath. Only a couple drops and my beard and stache are looking mighty fine!</li>
    <li> It is a very nice oil. I enjoy being able to obtain it in a 4oz size and the pump dispensor makes application far more efficient. I did not like the lime-ness at first but to is growing on me. Overall a solid product for a very good price.</li>
    <li> Bought for the first time to try it out and it works perfectly. Smell is like lemon and woods, but not too strong at all and it goes away after a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Husband has a shortish beard with dry skin and this has smoothed out the beard and calmed his skin well.</li>
    <li> I have honest amish beard balm which is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as well and let me say I am very pleased. it does the same exact thing that other balms do. whats the difference? its already an oil while others are a paste that you rub in your palm until it turns into an oil prior to application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;both do the same thing. it softens the beard. gives it a shine. and helps manage it better (not like a wax would sculpt it but it tames it a bit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has a light lime smell that I love and goes away quickly. so even if you don&#x27;t like lime don&#x27;t worry it doesn&#x27;t linger for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this over other products. why? bc with this you get twice the product for less cost. likely bc its on oil form vs a paste. who cares since you have to melt the balms anyway? any residue can be rubbed on your face, scalp, elbows, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product!</li>
    <li> It does a decent job of helping eliminate some of my beard dander, but I still have some flakes.  I think the important thing is to really rub the oil into your beard, and do this right after you get done drying your beard after showering.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this after he shaves, and on his bald head.  Love, love, love the smell, and the way it leaves his skin.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps the flakes away!</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. It may take a week or two depending on how bad your whiskers are (I had some pretty bad beardruff with the cold weather), but it works. The smell is very pleasant, but not overpowering and with daily use (2 pumps per day) I could easily see this stuff lasting 4 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend enough for those of us with beards.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend won&#x27;t kiss you because this smells bad?  Sounds like you need to get a new gf!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells and feels great!  I blow dry my beard after a shower and then work the oil in.  Two pumps might not seem like a lot and it does not make your beard wet like others are saying.  Maybe they don&#x27;t have much of a beard yet, but trust me this stuff works!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my husband, who always gets comments on his beard.  He puts this product on after he showers, and it adds a nice shine and a wonderful smell- kind of tropical lime - ish (but don&#x27;t worry, still manly).  He had noticed some dandruff in his beard before, but since regular use of a conditioning oil such as this one, that has no longer been an issue.  It gets my vote!</li>
    <li> great price and it smells nice</li>
    <li> conditioner never worked for my beard, and this at least makes it somewhat softer. I must have a bristlier beard than most, I guess. My wife isn&#x27;t a big fan of the lime scent, but she doesn&#x27;t like key lime pie either.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It has a wonderful spicy scent and is easily applied. The applicator could be a tad more generous but nothing another pump or two did not fix.</li>
    <li> Your mainly paying for quantity here. The odor isn&#x27;t too nice, a zesty lime tang, but it quickly evaporates after application. Besides that it&#x27;s quite nice for conditioning your beard and keeping your skin moisturized. I do miss the faint woodsy scent the other oil I tried had long after application (probably due to the different base oils used).</li>
    <li> It has a great sent and my husband prefers it over all of the beard oil he has tried.  4 years of beard and still going!</li>
    <li> I have a good variety of beard oils, but I use the Natural Man most often as my go to. Partly because there&#x27;s a lot of it, partly because it smells very nice, but is not overpowering. It makes my beard soft and shiny, and smells great. I will buy again when I run low.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just now getting to my second bottle of this beard oil. It&#x27;s lasted almost two years with near-daily use. Such a great value, I doubt I will look elsewhere. It smells great too, but doesn&#x27;t linger all day.</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do - takes the itch away and conditions the beard.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff (on my 2nd bottle) and the price/amount is fantastic. It keeps my beard very soft and personally, I love the smell. When I got my first bottle I had the original cap sitting on my desk and for about a week I could grab the cap and get a refreshing sniff :)  As others have stated, the smell is not overwhelming and does trail off after a short while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I do still have an issue with irritable skin at my jaw line. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not getting the oil dispersed correctly or not using enough. My beard is pretty long (about 1-2 inches above my belly button) but is not real thick/coarse. I have been using about 6 pumps and apply on average about 5 days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping time has been fantastic! Both orders were received within 4-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has thoughts on my usage amount or correct application method please reply.</li>
    <li> This oil does a good job softening one&#x27;s beard. It doesn&#x27;t leave much, if any, of a greasy residue. I can see how the smell is an acquired taste. The first time I put it on, my wife thought it was too strong, but after a few minutes it mellowed out and she changed her mind.</li>
    <li> Got if for my brother for Christmas.  Pretty soon, the others sheepishly asked if they could swap their gifts out for this stuff.  One says it gives him an &amp;#34;epic beard.&amp;#34;  I dont&#x27; normally like beards, but this product gives it a nice, subtle sheen.  theirs look nice.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps your beard in check. Pretty much everything you would want from a conditioning oil.</li>
    <li> Not too oily and has a pleasant smell. Gives the beard a healthy shine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female and I use this on my legs after shaving. I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin and shaving was awful. This keeps razor burn and itching away. Love it!</li>
    <li> Works just as described! Great manly aroma that&#x27;s sure to be complimented. Relieves the itch by coating both skin and hair, provide ding you with a non greasy shimmer . Great product, I&#x27;d recommend this over the waxes hands down!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because he is always complaining how rough his facial hair feels. He loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and it makes his beard nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Makes beard less frizzy</li>
    <li> I use it every day.  Not a noticeable smell.</li>
    <li> Works great and i don&#x27;t care what most say about the smell it&#x27;s not bad at all trust me I use it everyday and my wife likes it! And it makes the beard smooth as &amp;#34;F&amp;#34; lol. Just give it a try you will see...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It makes my beard smell great!</li>
    <li> If used this several times now and it is the best bang for the buck. Big 4 oz bottle with a pump which is easy to use. The lime bay is light and seems to last a while.</li>
    <li> Smells like a mixture of cumin, 75-weight gear oil and tobacco. And it feels like I just rubbed baby oil all over me. Wife hated it. If she&#x27;s not happy, then I can&#x27;t be happy. So that means it&#x27;s going back!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing! It softens facial hair, moistens skin, and smells incredible.  This is the only beard oil I will use from now on.</li>
    <li> It will make your beard softer, but I needed to use more than the one to two drops it said to use (more like five or six). It does have a nice scent too.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I haven&#x27;t tried anything else, but I love this product!  Three pumps for my beard and it&#x27;s all shiny, non-frizzy, and smells fantastic.  That is all.</li>
    <li> Makes my beard pretty soft, does not help much with keeping it orderly though. I would get wax for that</li>
    <li> Great beard product. I used this as I grew out my beard for an entire year, this was my primary beard oil. The bottle comes with a screw lid that can be replaced with a pump...this is good for traveling, switching them out to avoid accidental leaks. The pump puts out the right amount of oil each time, easily controlling the output so you don&#x27;t waste any or use too much. The aroma is not over powering but is pleasantly noticible. Not only did it help prevent split ends of my beard hairs but it helped moisturize my facial skin underneath, this was especially helpful during the dryer times of winter. The customer service was excellent also as I received an email asking how the product worked for me. I&#x27;ve made many purchases on Amazon and this is one of the few times this has ever happened. Inexpensive, a quality product that&#x27;s delightful to use, I highly recommend this to anyone of any beard type.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, it makes my beard feel pretty soft but I&#x27;m not really a fan of the scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a lime at all, I immediately thought it smelled like a bad knock off of A1 sauce.   Update: After about a week of using it my skin underneath is actually seeming to get dryer, specifically right under my nostril</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through several bottles of this over the past couple of years and it&#x27;s fantastic.  It keeps my beard soft and conditioned.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, product as expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn a beard for year without putting anything in it or on it, and boy have I suffered. Usually my chin is constantly itching and giving me a nice unpleasant dandruff pile on my shirt. Not so with this stuff, the itch is gone and the dandruff is seriously minimal. My beard feels a lot softer and my wife has complimented that on more than one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t really provide a beard taming factor like i was hoping, but for what it does it does it well.</li>
    <li> I like it very much.. smell is good not overpowering... softens niceley .. not much for the frizzies(need a trim) but definatly helps with the tangles beard is about 8&amp;#34; long and pretty thick.. use about a nickel to quarter size &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; in palm and work it through.. tried many different thus far and this product is in the top 3 ..  the amount of product you get for the price is a great value.. and will/ should last longer than most.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for over a week. The first day i noticed a big difference while brushing my beard down. The hair is much easier to guide with the brush now, there is no greasy appearance or residue. And it is much more soft to the touch. I cannot comment on its ability to sooth shaving as i only put it on my hair, not my skin. I put it on in the mornings and i feel like im back on the beach in mexico having a tequila. (Get it? because of the lime) anyways, i love the smell and quality of this product</li>
    <li> Great for my beard. People doggin&#x27; this item are probably using too much. Two to three squirts will be plenty for even a very burly beard. I had a large beard that was very coarse and this helped keep my face from drying out or becoming itchy. Smells good and the smell goes away mostly unless you use too much of the product.</li>
    <li> Was in the market for a while looking for a product that would not only condition my beard, but would could also be done without being too greasy or leave too strong of a scent. Happy to report that this product delivers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works exactly the way that you would expect. My beard is softer and even the GF agrees that this product has made a world of difference with my beard and has even commented how much softer my beard feels.  Easy to use and has become part of my morning ritual.</li>
    <li> My beard is very, very coarse, so much so that I often get splinters from playing with it while pondering something or another. This product seems to help a bit, but it isn&#x27;t going to turn your hair into a chinchilla. It does smell nice, kindof like lime. Would probably purchase again, but I&#x27;m still looking for something to soften the beard more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got a long, course beard that loves to curl at the ends. This amazing product, applied with a just a few drops each morning, really helps to soften my beard and make it more manageable. But I gotta tell you, it&#x27;s that sweet smell of rosemary that makes this product my favorite beard product.</li>
    <li> I got this to help with beard dandruff, and it seems to be working (about 1-2 weeks in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What amazes me is that not only can I stand the scent... I actually like it! It&#x27;s very subtle, not overpowering. And that&#x27;s saying a lot since it&#x27;s right under my nose in my moustache. It tends to wear off after an hour or so, which is also good in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Lime&amp;#34; is not the best description, it&#x27;s more like lime plus wood stain or leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only scented product I&#x27;m currently allowing in my regime right now.</li>
    <li> After watching too much Duck Dynasty my husband decided to grow out his beard. I chose this one because of the ratings on Amazon. I make him wear this oil when we go out to calm his long unruly hairs on his chin. Does a great job and smells good!</li>
    <li> My favorite thing about this is the fragrance.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it really &amp;#34;softens&amp;#34; my beard the way regular hair conditioners do, but maybe a little.  As another reviewer points out, depending on the length of your beard, the amount you need to use varies quite a bit.  It does give your beard a great shine.  I enjoy using the product, but I don&#x27;t have a NEED for it.  It may be more useful if you have a longer beard like Matisyahu (mine is more like Billy Mays).</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. This stuff is expensive. It does go a long way though because you do not need much at all. Smells good and conditions well. A-</li>
    <li> Great value for money and the customer service is really good as well.</li>
    <li> great consistency - keeps my relatively short beard soft and groomed - and the smell is amazing (just like coca-cola!)...the scent is only noticeable when people are close up, not at all overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my beard look much fuller. Better than other oils as the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great product and at a great price. The oil has a very pleasant smell, not too strong but enough to be noticed. Helps tame my beard and I also use it on my face and arms.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine shaving my beard, but the Mrs doesn&#x27;t like getting her face scratched when we smooch. Beard oil makes my whiskers feel and smell good to her so I don&#x27;t have to face Mr Razor Blade every morning. Happy, happy, happy.</li>
    <li> impulse buy. Smells good, but not likely to use it regularly</li>
    <li> I knew that bay lime would smell good to me so I purchased it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what my girlfriend would think, but she really likes the smell and likes the way it makes my beard feel.  It is a very good product for beard AND (because I shave my head as well) it&#x27;s great for the scalp too!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. It has a nice smell and leaves a fancy shimmer to the beard. I have bought this multiple times and will continue to buy in the future.</li>
    <li> Very good! Use it every day and people can see the difference after I started using this product.</li>
    <li> When my beard first came in it was hard to tell if it was helpful. but now  2 months in I can feel the difference.  Also I went a day without using beard oil and it got out of control.  definitely needed.</li>
    <li> Has a really nice smell. I wasn&#x27;t sure what beard oil was for exactly so I had to watch some YouTube videos about it. I am glad I purchased it and it will probably last me quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, and he loves it. Makes his beard very soft, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> This is a great deal and works as well as any other beard oil. I like the convenient dispenser. Minor con: too big to bring in airline carry-on.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smells really nice and feels great. My skin feels good and my beard looks very shiny and is not frizzy. Love it and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it! He has been recommending it to his friends who have beards as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes his beard softer and it smells really good. When it first goes on it smells strongly of lime, but after it dries it&#x27;s a light bay smell.</li>
    <li> It works well and is definitely much cheaper than the other products. Would have given it 5 stars but the container leaks a little around the top - I am sure it is just one of those things that happen from time to time so I wouldn&#x27;t let it discourage you from ordering it.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner and smells very fresh and clean.  It&#x27;s good on the hands too...especially during these dry winter months.</li>
    <li> If you have dry hair and want something that keeps it natural looking and not fly-away, one small squirt from the pump into your hand is all you need to spread out over your entire head of hair. It won&#x27;t look or feel oily, it&#x27;s as good all day long and at the end of the day and even after sleeping as it was when you put it on. Really excellent for head hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my beard, mine is *very* stiff and straight, which makes it poke whoever I am kissing, which is pretty terrible. I was doubtful but hopeful about finding a product that would sufficiently soften it, and this product did not do that. (I ended up shaving, because as much as I hate shaving, I like kissing much more :-)</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how well this product works. It smells great and leaves my beard soft for about 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. This is the first beard oil I&#x27;ve ever used and it works great. A friend of mine commented on how much better it smelled/felt than his more expensive oil. The lime scent is a little strong at first, but given that it is right under your nose it is to be expected. But so far I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments from others.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a GroomingLounge.com (order location)issue, but this bottle is made from low-quality plastic; and it leaks easily.  As for the product performance, it is quite oily, which is desirable during winter for me.  Yet, for some reason, the oil was not readily absorbed by my beard.  It took quite some time to be absorbed, while remaining an oily distraction.  I am seeking a conditioner that is absorbed and softens in less time than this Botanical oil does.  And, yes, I cleansed my facial hair properly prior to applying this product.</li>
    <li> I got it failry quickly. Which is nice, but, the smell is not the best in the world. It smells like lime and my wife hates it, she says it smells like the sauce you put on steak, starts with a W and i can&#x27;t spell it to save my life. I would not buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Smell is wonderful!! Almost reminds me of a citrus drink like 7UP! My beard is only a few weeks along, about 1/2\\&quot;. I got scolded for shaving it off and remembered how itchy a baby beard can get. I got this as a preemptive measure against itch and beard-druff and have to say that it works surprisingly well! Only 1 drop for me, rubbed in thoroughly, and I get a nice smooth even coating which will soak in after about half an hour. I can smell faint hints of it for hours afterwards, but never too overpowering. Wish this company offered more scents.</li>
    <li> It does perform as described but the amount required to have any conditioning effect is much more than as directed, and it is quite greasy feeling. If the price was much lower I would consider buying it again, maybe.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the other two (much more expensive) beard oils that I have purchased on Amazon and used.  The oil is lightweight and smells terrific.</li>
    <li> Bay Lime Beard Conditioning Oil left me less than impressed. I have used it for several days and literally can’t tell if it’s in or not. I’ve worn a beard for nearly 30 years, and the only products I’ve used are my normal shampoo and facial soap. However, I’ve recently begun growing my beard a bit longer, and I definitely needed something more to keep my look professional. This did nothing for me. Honest Amish Beard Balm is a much better product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Just two drops is enough to work into a sizeable beard and keep it feeling soft and smelling good. The scent to me was more nutmeg than bay lime, but i&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
    <li> I am growing out my beard - in fact, as I approach the half-way point to my teaching career (15 years remaining), I am considering letting it grow until retirement. For this to happen, I need help to keep the beard healthy and after a few weeks I am seeing a softer beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a couple of other products - all pastes. I think that I will stick with this one until I stumble across something better. I like that it&#x27;s an oil and can be applied quickly. I make sure I rub vigorously and try to get it on the roots as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight odor but it seems to dissipate fairly quickly. Seeing how I find the odor pleasant, it doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.</li>
    <li> I love the woodsy smell, gives my beard a nice sheen without being overly oily or greasy. I was hoping it would help straighten some rogue whiskers, but maybe that was asking too much.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day this year. Was perfect. Smells great and makes his beard so soft. And he loves it just as much as I do. Any left over oil you have you can put in your hair too.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help soften my beard.  I&#x27;ve always used standard hair conditioner and it&#x27;s worked well but figured something meant for a beard would work better.  I was wrong.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now (I figured this was enough time where it should have started to work) and my beard is more brillo-like than ever.  The one star is for the decent shine it gives a beard but it did nothing to soften.  It also made my beard itch a little which was not welcomed.  If I were you, I&#x27;d stick to standard hair conditioner as it works to soften a beard 100 times better than this oil.</li>
    <li> The scent is awesome - normally to get a nice &amp;#34;bay&amp;#34; scent, you have to resort to some of the old-school, alcohol-based aftershaves.  Growing in a beard for the first time, and this oil does a great job of softening it while also not drying out my skin.  Customer service is also first class!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! I love the feeling it gives when soothing the beard. The instructions also mention that you can always rub whatever extra that is left on the hands on your scalp or cuticles, and it works great in those places too.</li>
    <li> my husband likes the way it makes his beard really soft and it&#x27;s no longer been flaky or smelly which i love</li>
    <li> The product works as expected. The oil has a pleasant sent not overpowering, it seems to fade as the day goes on. The product does indeed soften and condition hair. The oil ads a shine to the hair and it seems straighter to be easier to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a value for the amount of oil to price ratio. The bottle is made of plastic which is okay but a glass upgrade would be a nice upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I liked it!</li>
    <li> I am surprised at all the positive reviews of this product, but I&#x27;ll pass along my thoughts and you can make your own judgements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the seller tried to get away with selling me a used bottle - it didn&#x27;t have a cap on it and no shrink-wrap or other signs this was a new package ... ergo, it was a used item they tried to pawn off on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try it once - only once - before I returned it. I cannot say anything about whether or not it works to soften a beard or whatever, but the smell about knocked me over. Maybe I am too sensitive to smell, but having this right under my nose after a a small squirt or two (and rubbing it in) was just too much. I immediately had to try and wipe it out of my small beard (goatee) with rubbing alcohol. Very, very pungent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the smell was about 20% strength, it would probably have been bearable.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Smells great and makes your beard very soft. I braid my beard and it is much easier to do with the Natural Beard Oil in it. Have never used a beard product before and I am completely sold on this product.</li>
    <li> Yes oiling your beard is good . Unfortunately this oil smell is pretty strong and your nose is right there to take it all in . Wont buy again because they smell is bad and really strong . I had to shower after  the first time i used it because i was getting a head ache .</li>
    <li> When I grow a beard this keeps it tame!  smells good and doesn&#x27;t make you breakout.</li>
    <li> It makes my beard smell nice but it leaves a greasy shine.  I&#x27;m still not sure what works better, this or just using normal hair conditioner...</li>
    <li> I saw how there are a lot of people who like the smell of this, but I don&#x27;t. I am a younger guy, so maybe this is marketed towards older generations. I do like the way my beard looks while using this product and the benefits do outweigh the smell for right now. So I will continue to use this product until I find something else.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells great and works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> The smell is almost medicinal, definitely not to my liking. When first applied it&#x27;s not subtle at all. However it does condition your beard well enough.</li>
    <li> Great value, and a nice classic scent.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The bottle pump is nice, smells good,definitely manly. It softens a growing beard, soothes skin while the beard is in that irritating stage. I have especially finicky skin and this man syrum is a pleasure to use. It&#x27;s good for your skin and I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Only one reason this doesn&#x27;t get a five star review - the smell. It&#x27;s like the potpourri section at a Michaels craft store. Citrusy? Cinnamony? Flowery? Woodsy? Or maybe some combination of all of those... I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe the fragrance, but I don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, this conditioning oil does its job and does it for a reasonable price. In the past I&#x27;ve used Burroughs beard oil, which is double the price for a container half the size of this one by Botanical Skin Works. And the results are the same - my beard is shiny and a lot more manageable after application. My lower neck is left unirritated after a shave. I was told by a friend with a thing for beards that mine is as soft as a bunny rabbit. Odd yes, but I&#x27;ll take a compliment. So from now on, this is my go-to beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your beard is wiry, scratchy, or out of control - buy this, it will help tremendously. But if you&#x27;re going somewhere important (a date, a business meeting, etc.) and don&#x27;t want to smell like one of those scented candles with a ridiculous name like &amp;#34;Autumn Path&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Citrus Grove&amp;#34;, apply it a couple of hours before heading out so the scent will have time to fade. You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil, but it really fails to soften your beard like the other beard balms.  I like to use the beard balm with the coconut oil in it . It doesnt smell great, but if you out it in before bed, your beard will be soft in the morning.</li>
    <li> Works great and makes my beard feel fuller.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my husband, who has a Duck Dynasty-worthy beard!  It keeps his fly-aways to a minimum and I love the smell and feel of it.  Keeps his beard soft.  The scent is not strong, but is fresh.  I will order this again!</li>
    <li> The pump makes it easier to apply than other kinds of beard oil that come with an eyedropper, but some oil does seem to end up on the bottle. I brush mine in, but I suppose you could rub it with your hands if you don&#x27;t mind getting them oily. It smells strongly when first applied, but the scent fades quickly. Leaves my beard feeling softer and prevents flaking.</li>
    <li> I have been using this beard oil for about a week, and I really like what it has done so far.  I have used it daily so far, and the biggest thing that I have noticed is that I don&#x27;t have issues with my beard getting unruly throughout the day.  This was the primary reason that I bought it.  I sleep on my face, and often when I wake up my beard is flattened an all over the place.  Working this product into the beard and combing it with a good boar bristle brush does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves the smell, and has commented on how much softer, fuller, and better maintained my beard looks.</li>
    <li> I am a girl and I use this stuff on the ends of my hair.  It tames my frizz better than any product that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! Just a little bit keeps my beard tame and soft all day. The scent is a really nice lime scent and perfect for summer use. And for about half the price of the other oils I&#x27;ve used and you get twice as much. Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This is a good mustache oil. I&#x27;m pleased with the way my &#x27;stache feels, and it has a subtle smell as well.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Ample amount and it&#x27;s not irritating like others.  I sometimes use it twice a day for my beard.</li>
    <li> Wife doesn&#x27;t like the smell. I think it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Might just be my skin, but I didn&#x27;t notice any skin conditioning.</li>
    <li> The effect of using this was immediate and significant.  Instead of applying the oil to your palms like the bottle directs, i recommend placing a drop on the tip of each middle finger (yes, two drops for a full bread,) using your thumb to work it onto your other fingers and into your beard from there.  you&#x27;ll get much deeper penetration doing this than you would by just wiping your palms on your face.  If you&#x27;re not a fan of the bay lime scent you&#x27;ll only have to suffer a minute; it doesn&#x27;t last long and it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
    <li> Works great, keeps skin moisturized, smells nice, and keeps your bearded looking healthier.  I enjoy this product very much. :)</li>
    <li> I use this conditioning oil everyday. I love the smell and keeps my beard smooth and gives it a slight sheen. It makes my skin feel great, too.</li>
    <li> First I would like to start by saying that this is the first time I buy any kind of &amp;#34;beard oil/conditioner&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the review; I really like how this product smells... it smells a little strong when you put it on but as time goes by, you can only perceive a hint of its wood/citrus/herbs smell. And that&#x27;s when the product really shines. Speaking of &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;, this product will give your beard a very good/healthy looking shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, if you can really call it that, is that it really doesn&#x27;t help much controlling your beard.  Your beard will feel better but if you had a hard time controlling it before the product, chances are you&#x27;ll still have a hard time (maybe a little less hard).</li>
    <li> Have only used this product for two weeks, but I do notice a difference in my beards softness. I would recommend it to other bearded folks.</li>
    <li> Anyone who values the beard that wears them would love this product. It has left my long beard soft and manageable. It smells terrific and isn&#x27;t to heavy. I highly recommend this beard conditioner.</li>
    <li> The product worked well although instead of using 2 pumps I usually use 5 or 6. It softened my hair but for the most effect I still recommend using conditioner as well.</li>
    <li> I love using this product for my beard.  It has a slight, masculine woodsy scent that is very subtle.  All you have to do is pump a few drops on your hand, and rub on your beard.  Then groom your beard.  Your beard stays shiny and controlled, and the subtle scent is a big bonus too.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend, who has been growing out the ol&#x27; beard this year, because as it was growing rather longish, it was also feeling dry + itchy in the undergrowth. He really likes it, and told me I could put his thoughts into a review for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Great price.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice pump, so not messy.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells good, but wishes it lasted longer and/or was maybe a little more strongly scented. (Reason for 1 star deduction)&lt;br /&gt;-(I *also* think it smells good, which is a pro, imo!)&lt;br /&gt;-Softens the beard and helps with the itchies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;quot;Uh, none.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it. He and/or I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(...Though he is considering letting me customize my own mix of oil + essential oils for him so he can get a longer-lasting, more personalized fragrance. :D)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 12/13/2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the rate of being used a couple times a week this bottle lasted almost a full year. We went to try something else, but it had a fake fragrance along with the essential oil, which we noticed because the bottle has a leak. So we returned that one for the damage and didn&#x27;t reorder due to the scent being so bad. Then we reorder this because, well, why message with awesome?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great - he and I both agree on this - and it makes the beard soft, squelches the itchies. It is long lasting as a little goes a long way. Also please note: my boyfriend says this feels best - and works best - when applied just after your shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps! And enjoy your awesome beard!</li>
    <li> My beard is amazingly soft and the smell is great. Oddly, have gotten more compliments on my beard since I&#x27;ve started using it, so it must look better too.</li>
    <li> The product began to significantly softer my beard after only 2-3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also received several compliments on the faint smell it leaves behind when a woman is burring her face in my beard.</li>
    <li> As a disclaimer: I have never used any other beard oils before buying this one. I&#x27;ve been using this oil for close to two weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been growing a beard for about 6 weeks now, and wanted to get some oil to soften up my beard and moisturize my skin. I was a bit concerned about the scent, after reading some of the reviews. My experience, however, has been very positive. I use 2 or 3 pumps (on rare occasion, I&#x27;ll use a fourth) and rub it really well into my beard and mustache. I&#x27;ll smell the oil for the first 5 or 10 minutes after using it, but rarely after that. My first few days of using the oil, I was very aware of the smell (it does have a bit of a Christmas-y smell) but since I rarely notice it. I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from friends or family that the smell was off-putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is fairly light and seems to &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; into my beard (not sure if it really soaks in, or just stays close to my skin). I&#x27;ve not had any problems with my beard feeling oily, or my clothes getting oil stains. I wear collared shirts to work everyday, including white shirts and haven&#x27;t observed any issues there.</li>
    <li> Great stuff cleared up my itchy chin issue plus my beard looks and smells great.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about the smell when I ordered this. It&#x27;s subtle and it doesn&#x27;t last very long either, so no worries there. This is the first and only oil I&#x27;ve ever used on my beard, which is at a length of approximately 6 months at this time.  Using this oil makes my beard softer. It doesn&#x27;t seem so coarse/wiry/brittle. It also makes it easier to brush into the shape I want. It makes the beard shiny, especially immediately after applying, and that took a little getting used to for me, but now I suppose I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard somewhere you should use 2 drops of oil, I use 3 of this every time because my beard is pretty big and thick. 3 does the trick just fine. I&#x27;d recommend you combine this with a boar&#x27;s head brush for a nice, one-two approach for maintaining and shaping a beard of significant size. Does not seem necessary to me personally if you have less than 3 month&#x27;s growth on you. I started using it around the time I got to 3 months.</li>
    <li> works great, keep itch away!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, lightly lime-scented beard oil.  It helps tame my crazy curly beard hair and softens it up a bit so the wife doesn&#x27;t complain as much about smooching me as she did before.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 2 months at least 4-5 times a week. It smells nice and it gives my beard a nice shine when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it make my beard any softer? I can&#x27;t really tell. I had a really long beard for the first month I used it and it didn&#x27;t seem like it made much of a difference. I&#x27;m back to a shorter beard now, (number three on the clippers) and I&#x27;m not sure its making a difference now either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For less than twenty bucks, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m out much money... but I&#x27;m not sure I will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I have tried many beard conditioners and they all worked great,and this is no exception,The bay lime beard conditioner works great and it has a very light scent,I would use this if i was going out,makes my beard look and feel great,most conditioners come in a 1 oz. Bottle,this a 4 oz. Bottle which makes it a great buy.when I get low I will buy more! oh and the scent,a cross between clove and lime just right!!</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does! I use this to sort of tame my beard and not have it going all over the place. If you&#x27;re anything like me and have a beard that&#x27;s like sand paper than you need this. It has a very nice smell to it also which is sort of lemony. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months know and still have plenty to go, so your money goes a long way with it!</li>
    <li> This item was given as a gift to my son from his daughter for Fathers Day.  He LOVES IT and is still thanking my granddaughter for giving it to him.  I think he will become a customer for sure.</li>
    <li> Decided to take my beard seriously about two months ago and purchased this one after reading the reviews. I have a thin-ish, naturally soft and slightly long beard. It makes is shine in the sun and feels great. I have found that I would like to use it twice a day but I have not yet. I use it right after a conditioner treatment in the shower and after I put on a shirt. Smells good and you will want to stroke your beard even more...try not too.</li>
    <li> Good scent, works well with 3 to 4 drops, lasts 4 to 6 hours. It works fine though have a very &amp;#34; difficult beard &amp;#34;. I recomend this product.</li>
    <li> After using mainly balms it was time to check out some oils. starting with this one. I like the scent, it doesn&#x27;t linger and it&#x27;s not overwhelming. For a larger beard I found it too thin and requires a good amount of the oil to get god saturation. I notice by the end of my shift at work the oil is gone and the beard is dry. I can&#x27;t recommend this product for thick/heavy beards or tough conditions.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend&#x27;s giant beard. It tames it and makes it very shiny. And it smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it advertised itself as being a beard softener. I do not notice any effect on the softness of my beard, which is quite course. As a result, I cannot recommend this product. It should do what it says it will do, and it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This beard conditioner smells nice and seems to work. I&#x27;ve noticed that my beard seems a bit softer and the itch is definitely gone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent price, and simple process in obtaining.</li>
    <li> Great size and amount for the price! It met all my expectations and those expressed by the seller. But the lime scent is not for me.</li>
    <li> First everyones beard and skin is different. It helps with the moisture issues and the dry skin. If I put a lot in my face itches, but it has to be a lot. Doesn&#x27;t completely keep my beard hydrated like I hoped, so maybe only a piece of the puzzle. Nice sent. Side effect is my dog really likes my face now..</li>
    <li> Transforms my beard in a matter of moments from scratchy and annoying soft and shiny. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My beard can be a little rough and itchy, especially as it grows in. So I wanted to try out this product. But I found that this product not only did not make my beard any softer, but it also irritated my skin and made me even more itchy. I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, but I think the concentration in this product is just pretty strong. I usually just use one or two pumps of the stuff since a little goes a long way. But it just wasn&#x27;t doing to the trick for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, on the plus side, this stuff smells fantastic! If it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and the smell didn&#x27;t fade quickly I would use this more often. Maybe I&#x27;ll try it in my head hair and see how that goes. haha.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. It helps keep beard itch at bay, but I had the itch really bad. While this did help, I just can&#x27;t handle the itch!</li>
    <li> Like others have stated, this oil is the best.  The smell is manly and pleasant; and it leaves my beard so soft during the day that I love touching my beard during the day.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is purely subjective but I hated the smell of this beard oil. Maybe I don&#x27;t like the smell of &amp;#34;Bay&amp;#34; but to me it smelled nothing of lime. It had a very strong medicinal smell, took me a while to place it but it smelled like the dentist office, a mixture of medicine and cloves. Yuck! Again, this is my personal response to the smell. From reading the other reviews lots of people like it but if you don&#x27;t like the smell of  clove mixed with medicine and the dentist office then I&#x27;d pass on this.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the feel is great. I can really feel a difference in my beard. the Conditioner works great</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff and received a compliment the first time I put some on before seeing a female friend :). I was using wax for my beard before and still have some left, but this oil is much easier + quicker to use and also more affordable. This oil, along with brushing and trimming my beard, has really cleaned up my look. 5/5 - would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my dad! He loved it. He said it made his beard softer and the smell was great!</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry beard and skin. Very nice light lime scent. Pump helps to use the right amount.</li>
    <li> As my beard grows out it gets unruly, especially after being washed.  This does a great job of helping keep my beard soft, smooth and neat.  However, the smell of the product is just odd.  It might be pleasing to some people, but it is not for me.  My wife isn&#x27;t a big fan of the smell either.  I will continue to use this product, but will try something else next time.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Being an African American, our beards tend to be very unruly after months of growth. This product makes my beard very soft and helps to lay it down.</li>
    <li> Smells good, easy application (like the spray top) and my coarse beard feels very soft after just a few days. I have tried many beard conditioners and this one softens without residue or greasiness. Great product!</li>
    <li> i bought it for my bf and it smells good. he doesn&#x27;t use it much, says it&#x27;s too thick like hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product. Beards, Beards, Beards, Beards, Beards, Beards, Beards, Beards, Beards, Beards, Beards, Beards, Beardy Beard Beard....</li>
    <li> While my beard did feel smoother to the touch, it left it looking dull.  I keeping the bottle to use in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 6 other beard oils and Natural Man Beard oil is the best !</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, hydrate the beard and skin underneath. Good price, good size bottle, great manly scent! A must buy!</li>
    <li> Smells good, beard became softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Especially for greying to white beards of any length.</li>
    <li> Smells really great. The lime scent is a touch feminine, but the wood scent balances it alright. Hard to tell if it&#x27;s really doing anything, but my beard is also very thick and wirey. Not sure if I will buy this one again, but the price was great.</li>
    <li> It does soften the beard like its supposed to but it doesn&#x27;t smell very manly. I&#x27;ve smelled better and used better.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is quite strong but nice (smells marginally like cloves to me). That said, the smell dissipates pretty quickly and you can barely smell it on your beard within 20 minutes (e.g. I will usually put this on just before leaving my house in the morning, and when I pat down my beard upon arriving at class, the beard does not leave a smell on my hands). It does soften the beard a bit, but not as much as hair conditioner would soften the hair on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem: it is difficult to get just 2 drops out when using the built-in squirting mechanism, but you figure out how to minimize the amount of liquid released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Been looking at beard oils for quite sometime, wanted something with a light scent and something that came in a bottle that wasn&#x27;t going to require me to buy another bottle in a few weeks.  This is the product I&#x27;ve been looking for.  The scent is a light masculine scent that doesn&#x27;t linger longer than it should.  The oil has done a great job in keeping my beard looking good, its really helped in taming the stray hairs that were becoming a real issue during the day and my skin under the beard isn&#x27;t dry anymore.  I will definitely be purchasing this again when I need more.</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic! I have a very tough beard that has given my GF issues time to time on her chin from it. This product softens it up very well and smells awesome as well!</li>
    <li> Anyone who already tends to have dry, sensitive skin or beardruff, beware.  This product had the opposite effect I was hoping for.  It ended up making my beard very itchy and 10 fold the amount of beardruff I&#x27;m used to having.  Now this could have something to do with putting the product on and then working in partial sunlight 8 hours, but I didn&#x27;t notice any warnings saying not to expose it to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and does soften my beard, but one of the main reasons I got this product was to keep my beard feeling and looking nice.  From the reviews it seems I&#x27;m in the minority, but thought it was worth documenting that this is not for everyone.</li>
    <li> great scent, absorbs remarkably well into your beard, and definitely softens the scraggles.</li>
    <li> This works well, and has a pleasant TeaTree scent. It softens the hair and keeps the skin underneath moist. I find it most useful on the moustache.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband , he really likes it . Says his beard is soft now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty cool. It has worked very well on my bread. I had beard dandruff, my beard was rough like a brillow pad, and I had dry patching skin under my beard and after using this beard balm for about a week my beard has softened, darkened and just looks better. You can also use it if you have dry scalp.</li>
    <li> Meh. This stuff is light.</li>
    <li> Have only had this for a few days so can&#x27;t comment yet on long term effectiveness, but I&#x27;m liking it so far and it does seem to be softening my beard. As far as the scent goes, I think it&#x27;s exactly as described and what you&#x27;d expect from the ingredients. Very similar to Royall Bay Rhum cologne, but not as strong or long lasting. Not pricey at all for a beard oil; it&#x27;s by far the best value out there.</li>
    <li> My only complaint about this product would be that the pump is a little impractical for application - but beyond that, it&#x27;s outstanding. Smells pleasant in a way that fades into the background shortly after application, keeps my beard soft, and keeps me from looking like an old sea captain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually works really nicely for putting a quick shine on your hair after a shower if you&#x27;re not trying to goop it up and get stylish.</li>
    <li> Smells great (bright, citrussy when first applied, but not annoyingly cloying or persistent), smoothens and softens my beard. Two drops go a long way, so this bottle should last quite a while. Doesn&#x27;t provide much in the way of control, but nonetheless tames the inevitable frizz somewhat.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Smells nice and isn&#x27;t too greasy. Clearly improves the health and appearance of my beard.</li>
    <li> light, not greasy. Smells good, woodsie but not over bearing. Leaves skin feeling smooth and minimizes razor bumps and burns. Not sure what it actually does for beard however</li>
    <li> this stuff is awsome. buy it !</li>
    <li> Good smelling, good quality oil for my beard for a great price.  What more can you ask for!</li>
    <li> At age 73 I&#x27;m making my 1st attempt at growing a full set of facial hair in response to harassment by several of my grandchildren.  I purchased this conditioning oil trying to make it a little less itchy and prickly.  It has definitely helped, but I don&#x27;t have enough expertise in grooming facial hair to rate it above &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;, though it may well deserve a better rating.  Timely delivery, packaging, etc. by the seller was top notch, so on that parameter I&#x27;m experienced enough to give 5 stars for Seller performance.</li>
    <li> Just got this today, and I really like it.  It smells nice, makes my beard feel all happy, and tames the tangles a bit.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> My husband has achieved wizard status with his beard!  It is brittle and wiry and scratchy.  Hot, but beasty.  This oil makes it soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works as advertized.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! I have been using this for over a year and it softens and calms the beard. Smells great too&#x27;</li>
    <li> Great smelling beard sops it up like a sponge and it makes it real soft.</li>
    <li> Been Using this for 1 month (daily) now and the softness of my beard is noticeable. I also have been complemented on how shiny it looks and my splashes of red in my beard have significant more &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34;. The smell is pleasant and is only noticeable for a few minutes after application.</li>

    <li> As of July of 2014, I ordered this product and I can say I would recommend this to any guy that needs to take care of their beard. I&#x27;ve had this product for almost 7 months (down to the final drop currently) and it has worked wonders for my beard and has helped greatly with my split ends and maintaining moisture. The smell is very pleasant and I&#x27;ve had no complaints of dry/flaked skin.</li>
    <li> So far my favorite beard oil. I&#x27;m trying out various ones once I run out but this was smells great, is easier to get out with the squirter, and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I previously relied on hair conditioner in the shower, but was lacking what I wanted throughout the day. This oil helps soften and condition the beard while providing a gentle shine. Definitely recommend for anyone!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the bay lime scent, but it isn&#x27;t as strong when applied to the hair.  The product definitely delivers.  My husband&#x27;s beard was softer and more manageable within a few uses.  He love&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Item has a good scent and helps a little with taming a wild beard, but if yours is really wild, go for something explicitly designed for it. Skin feels good after use and throughout the day</li>
    <li> Love this product it really does make you&#x27;r beard soft and moisturizes skinn....</li>
    <li> After putting loads of leave in conditioner in my beard in the past, I was shocked by the strength of this.  Just use a couple drops and DON&#x27;T start with your mustache because the rosemary will be overpowering.  But once you get the hang of it, it will leave your beard stache and even hair feeling and smelling great with just 2 drops.</li>
    <li> I bought this to tame my new beard.  The product works as advertised but the fragrance is just not appealing to me.  And if you don&#x27;t like that, then you have a problem since you are applying the product right under you nose!</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells, it makes the beard soft and much more bearable.  The only down side is that I have naturally oily skin, and it makes my skin a bit too oily.</li>
