    <li> terrific information for one of the most interesting aspects of WWII.</li>
    <li> As natural as rain water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Rinses out of your hair easily and completely. Wash  once, rinse once  and you are done..</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used successfully for several years with natural results.  I highly recommend it.  The availability in my area has diminished and ordering from Amazon is just plain easier.  JS Pleasant Hill</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for several years.  I have really short hair and or gives my hair a lot of volume and does not make my hair oily.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes your hair feel renewed, fuller, and healthier.  I just love the ocean smell in the Aquage prodcucts!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo on market for my fine hair!!! Been using it for 15 years. Amazon shipping is also the best!</li>
    <li> Love it and will re-order on this one soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those women who&#x27;ve come to terms with truly &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; hair - the trifecta of woe.  Thin. Fine. Straight.  This shampoo seems to help, but I&#x27;ll tell you what you MUST pair it with - Aquage spray thickening gel.  That stuff is awesome!  Just a little massaged in damp hair and blown out really makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for fine and colored hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I first started using it per my stylist recommendation after coloring my hair and I love the way it cleans my hair and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I have thin-medium hair and this product seems to give a little body.  Not terrific but smells great and works for me.  A little pricey but I bought it over 6 months ago and still have some left.  Don&#x27;t use it every day but alternate with another shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. The scent is clean and refreshing. I love the product line. It&#x27;s safe for my color treated hair and perfect for everyday use on my fine hair. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Luxurious doesn&#x27;t quite cover this.  I tried this shampoo based on reviews here on Amazon.com. I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s a very fresh scent and just a tiny bit goes a long way. The lather is wonderful, and this does not dry out my curly hair.  It is a very mild shampoo, excellent for curly hair. Haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Though I love the produce this time both my the shampoo and conditioner came with a cracked top, some of the product leaked into the packaging  and part of each product up was dried as air was allowed in.  In order to utilize the remainder of the product, I had to transfer to another bottle.  I feel the company should ship another bottle at their cost.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s very fine, so I was looking for something that would give me a little volume but not dry my hair or scalp out. I think it&#x27;s about as volumizing as a shampoo can be without stripping your hair. My favorite thing though is that it seems to keep my hair cleaner longer, I can go two days between washing&#x27;s instead of 1 and it doesn&#x27;t look stringy. It has a gel-like consistent but lathers well. I use Triple Moisture Daily Deep Conditioner on the ends of my hair and the combo leaves my hair feeling more soft, thicker and cleaner longer.</li>
    <li> I loved this shampoo. I color my hair and this shampoo made it soft and manageable. The lather is wonderful also. I would diffinitely buy it again. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST shampoo for fine hair! I have very fine hair but a TON of it! Not only that my hair is very long, mid to lower back. So my hair is often times limps at the roots. With this shampoo my hair has tons of volume and stays grease free! I hope I can buy it here on amazon for forever as my local salons don&#x27;t carry it!</li>
    <li> It is the best shampoo I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Produces a lot of foam and my hair is smooth and silky.</li>
