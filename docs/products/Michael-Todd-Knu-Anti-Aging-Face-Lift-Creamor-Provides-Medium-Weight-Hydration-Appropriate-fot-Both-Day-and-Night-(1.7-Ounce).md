      <li>This product isn&#x27;t even a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>So, I gave the benefit of the doubt to an un-known brand with good PR and advertised in Groupon.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for one week</li>
      <li>Any moisturizer is good for the face.</li>

      <li>I paid good money for it and have requested a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I loved it until someone asked me if I&#x27;d had &amp;#34;something done&amp;#34; to my skin to make it look so good.</li>
      <li>So use a good eye serum if you use this around your eye area.  </li>
      <li>I also put a good layer around my lips and just on my lips.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>It is not even a good moisturizer, let alone an effective anti-aging product like it claims.</li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love waking up and not have my skin be the cure for the oil crisis!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells funny and doesnt get absorbed all the way. Might work- too soon for me to tell...</li>
    <li> I bought this product x2 via a Living Social voucher for $25 a jar and wish I could return both of them.  First, the product looks nothing like the contents you see pictured in the jar in the photo.  The texture is a sticky slimy thin type watery lotion. It reminds me of thinned Elmer&#x27;s glue (I am not kidding).  If you are not careful, it will spill upon opening, so be careful.  It is not a thick firming moisturizing creme. When you apply it to your skin, it does not absorb. Rather, it sits on your skin like a layer of stickiness. It streaks as you apply it. It does not take long to dry, but when it does, you feel as if you have a film on your face and I half expected it to crack and flake - it leaves an unnatural looking film that dries and gives a strange sensation of tightening - but this is artificial and breaks down within a couple of hours.  When you moisten it to wash it off, it becomes slippery, again.  It is a strange product and after reading the description about the active ingredients of tri-peptides and snail serum, I have to chuckle as that is what it does remind me of. As if a snail slithered all over my face and left slimy snail tracks. Eeek.  I wish I could return both of these for a full refund as the product is sincerely the worst facial product I have ever used,  Another reviewer is correct, it has a strange smell. I would not say it smells like dirty socks, but it does not smell pleasant. And, I am not picky.  I have used Dior products as well as SkinCeuticals. Heck. the pump lotion sold at Trader Joes with no parabens is more moisturizing and firming than this Knu snail serum!</li>
    <li> Ordered through Living Social. Very disappointing - no result. What is worse, it causes breakouts. I don&#x27;t notice any bad smell, however, even when using a tiny bit, this cream leaves a film on skin.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I tried posting comments on their web-site - they never got posted. If you see reviews on their web-site, they are all positive. Makes you think about the validity of their reviews, right?</li>
    <li> I ordered this to try it out, and I&#x27;m on my second jar. I&#x27;ve had horrible acne scars my entire life and this cream has really helped my face. It&#x27;s not a magic spell, but results are significant.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the incredible way it makes my face look. Surprised at the folks who didn&#x27;t like it and compared it to Elmers Glue. If I thought Elmers Glue would make my skin look this great, I would buy it by the carton.</li>
    <li> I am about to purchase my second jar of Michael Todd&#x27;s Knu - - I also got it in a Living Social Deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why people don&#x27;t like it either.  I am not sure how it works, or what exactly it is doing to my face but it definitely smooths out my skin, truly leaving a silky healthy look to it.  It seems to smooth out the skin, yet it isn&#x27;t a moisturizer.  I use moisturizer on top of it (I also have dry skin and no, I don&#x27;t get the flakes that people talk about.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not offensive.  It kind of, yeah, glue-ish, but I don&#x27;t smell it anymore once I close up the jar.  It isn&#x27;t over powering anyway. Let me put my review this way:  I am about to buy another jar.  I am glad I can buy it here on Amazon and not spend $150, but IF I had to spend $150 I would.  No joke.  I really like how it leaves my skin looking - - it also seems to get better and better as I use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pricey if you don&#x27;t get a deal, but it&#x27;s great stuff!  All of their products are great.  I have sensitive skin and this skin care never makes me sting or my eyes water, which I have with lots of other products.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re young and have minimal lines, this may not be the right product for you. But if you&#x27;re like me, over 50, starting to get that &#x27;jowl&#x27; look and/or have sun damage on your neck, face and chest that makes your skin look kind of like overcooked chicken skin - this stuff works! It took about a month of daily useage to see good results but I see the lines on my forehead going away, around my eyes and that chicken skin on my neck and chest - MUCH better! The jowls are improving too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the deal on Groupon and was hesitant paying anymore than the what I had - $150 is just not in my price range. But this - I can afford! It does have a slight &#x27;glue&#x27; smell but then again my nose is so sensitive that I can smell something going bad in the fridge without opening the door for 12 hours. It&#x27;s not an offensive smell, it doesn&#x27;t last either. It does go on without feeling greasy - meaning it&#x27;s not on your pillow the next morning. I use Origins in the day, this at night. Sometimes I may apply a light cream over the top if I feel too dry. I love waking up and not have my skin be the cure for the oil crisis! I even use it around my eyes and have had FABULOUS results there. I look like I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s rather than mid-50, thanks to this cream!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price!!  It is simple to use.  Just make sure to follow with your favorite moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I truly do see an improvement using this cream!  Using it twice daily, it seems to help increase the moisture in my face.</li>
    <li> Once I discovered this product (I think it was a Living Social deal?), I haven&#x27;t gone back to my old face creams.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I love what Knu anti-aging face cream does for my skin. It tightens up those little wrinkles and makes my skin glow.</li>
    <li> new &#x27;meaured&#x27; top is a nice concept but can squirt more than you think.&lt;br /&gt;cream is good but doesn&#x27;t seem as effective as prior supply.</li>
    <li> I liked this product at first.  I got it for way cheaper than $75 because of a coupon.  It seemed to moisturize pretty well without being oily and anything that moisturizes well will make your skin look better and smooth out creases.  In the winter, however, it wasn&#x27;t enough to keep my skin moisturized at night.  My skin just got way too dry.  It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it does have snail juice in it, so that&#x27;s to be expected.  It has the consistency of glue, too.  It might work for you or it might not.  Everybody is different. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for it, though.  I stopped using the Knu moisturizer and store-bought facial cleansers and now use some homemade, natural \\&quot;face washes\\&quot; and changed my moisturizer to natural Aloe Vera (not the green, slimy stuff) and The Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin E Night Cream.  My skin is has improved a lot, and I save money by making my own skincare products.r.  I live in a hot, humid climate, and for the last couple of years, there really hasn&#x27;t been much of a winter.  This year, however, has been really cold, so my skin is a lot more dried out.  This cream just doesn&#x27;t cut it in the winter months, and if you have dry skin (unlike me), this probably won&#x27;t do much for you no matter what the month.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  It seemed to be working, but couldn&#x27;t stand up to a little cold weather.  I just started using [[ASIN:B005TI7L6O Simple Replenishing Rich Moisturizer Ounce]] instead.  So far, it is doing a better job of moisturizing my skin and improving its appearance, but it isn&#x27;t anti-aging.  It seems like most of these anti-aging creams, serums, etc. aren&#x27;t that great, and just moisturizing your skin, exercising, wearing sunscreen, getting enough sleep, and eating healthy foods like fruits and vegetables will do a lot more for your skin than these gimmicky creams.    UPDATE (Sept. 17, 2014):  My skin has been looking so much better.  This is what I&#x27;ve been doing:  I started washing my face with organic honey in the morning, then at night, I use oil(I combined two oils based on my skin type; you can look up different diy \\&quot;recipes\\&quot;), I use aloe vera as a moisturizer (not the sticky, green kind, but the natural kind), then either put The Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin E night cream on whether it&#x27;s morning or night or a sunscreen with natural ingredients, I have been working out consistently, I have been eating healthier, I use a humidifier at night, I drink a lot of water, and I have been getting at least eight hours of sleep most nights.  All of this has made a HUGE difference, not just in how my skin looks, but how I feel.  I suggest not using harsh chemicals or worrying about anti-aging creams and just take care of yourself if you want good skin.</li>
    <li> I have been addicted to this face cream since I started using it 18months ago. Fast, noticeable results!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a month ago on LivingSocial for $20.  Withing the first two weeks, I received an email from them asking me to review this product.  I simply stated that I hadn&#x27;t noticed anything, it was too early.  Another 2 weeks later and I was looking in the mirror...I&#x27;ve  always had 2 very distinct lines under my left eye that always bothered me.  So, I&#x27;m lookingeven closer and notice only one crease, then looked at the crows feet at both sides of my eyes.  Smoother skin!  Can&#x27;t believe it!  I&#x27;m 44 years old.  I have used so many products throughout the past 20 years and nothing has made me see remarkable results in such a short time!  I was so excited, I brought it to my husband&#x27;s attention. I knew I wanted to buy more and show him the results!  His response..?  Well, he didn&#x27;t see any difference to my beauty because I&#x27;m always beautiful.  \\&quot;Right answer, huh?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew who I saw, in the mirror day in and day out.  Every morning and every night I wash my face and put a cream on. Yes seven (7) days a week.  I even pluck my eyebrows with one of those horrific, magnifying mirrors with lights that show EVERYTHING ON YOUR FACE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am.  I either never respond to these reviews or make a small comment.  I CAN ONLY SAY FOR ME, THIS MICHAEL TODD KNU FACIAL LIFT PRODUCT WORKS! IT SMELLS GREAT, IT&#x27;S SILKY SMOOTH AND A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! I&#x27;ve read some other bad reviews and maybe you did get a bad batch if it smelt like feet.  I researched this product and know it goes for around $150 so I really got my moneys worth.  I only wish I purchased more, but I don&#x27;t buy too much of anything just because it&#x27;s on sale, especially, if I don&#x27;t believe in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has shown ME remarkable results.  I only hope it lasts!  It just seems to good to be true but I&#x27;m sure enjoying the results!! Only wish I took before and after pics!  If I can find some, I sure will post them!&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all you ladies who are trying to find the fountain of youth as I!!!the fountain of youth as I!!!</li>
    <li> amazing product. Works well. Surpirsed at the bargain that this product turned out to be. Very pleased. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It absorbs well and seems to be working well.  I like that it is made from natural substances.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve tried so far, and believe me I have tried products from Olay to La Mer to SKII.  It has no smell, ok, maybe a tiny bit very faint sweet smell.  It doesn&#x27;t go on oily, totally different from the creams I&#x27;m used to so some people might find it not moisturize enough.  I have oily skin so this is perfect, light weight, absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.  And the results?  You know the glowing shinny look your skin has after a facial treatment?  This is what I get from this cream.  Love it!</li>
    <li> does not work at all feels like your putting glue on your face dont make the same mistake as me if its to good to be true then usually its true</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Its so good for your face - it gives a true face lift.  I wish Amazon will have more promotions for this product as it is very expensive outside Amazon...Thank ;you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist. I test products carefully.  I used this cream on ONE SIDE of my face to compare with my usual face cream.  I did this every DAY AND NIGHT for over a month.  I carefully checked my face in a 10X magnify mirror every 3 days.  I have not seen ANY difference in lines, lift, smoothness, etc.  The cream is slimy and takes a longer time to absorb so application is difficult.  It is OK, once it is dry, to apply makeup.  Given the quality of this product compared to other good face cream I DO NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I love my Knu Anti-Aging face lift.  I put it on every night like a mask and leave it &#x27;til morning!  My skin has never looked better!!</li>
    <li> I did not notice anything until after 1 month.  I actually received complements on how great my face looks.  I actually order the product for 2 friends.</li>
    <li> I finally found a product that works, I see a noticable improvment in my facial features, im  55 years old but, looks 40.</li>
    <li> This little jar, which is actually quite big, will last about two to three months. It is a miracle. If you use this regularly, you will never need a face lift with surgery. This product does its own face lift. You will see results in less than two days. It got rid of all my wrinkles. And, I have been receiving a lot of compliments on how young I look. I was simply looking for a great organic moisturizer, when I found it on Groupon.com. You can also, find it on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This product had a consistency like it had melted. It spilled on my dressing table, and I lost almost all  the product.</li>
    <li> easy to put, don&#x27;t feel oily,haven&#x27;t see any improved, at least feel good:) after I finish this bottle, will see if worth to buy another one.</li>
    <li> This is completely drying cream I have ever used. Makes my skin dry and even making it harder to smile. Don&#x27;t know how this is going to help in anti-aging. May be because its a fake cream, after all its way lower price than the real one posted on Michael Todd&#x27;s website. Wish I could return and get refund. But the packaging clearly said no returns unless its sealed like when it was shipped. Completely ridiculous terms for return.</li>
    <li> Im using it for abt a week, is putting glue on my face I was so dissapoiment, so for lines, pores dont see will work, just tight ur face as a glue, but I had blemishes, marks from pimples and it helps with that making my scarfs looks better so for anti aging nope, but for blemish go for it, also I have to say the acne I was suffering was caused for michael todd sensitive regimen,, this brand its not was youtube is trying to sell</li>
    <li> I had heard great things about this product, but as a recovering product junkie, I was reluctant to purchase it, just In case it was another dud. I was pleasantly surprised when, after about three weeks, my adult acne started to clear up and my skin felt more taut. Be aware that it is not a moisturizer, so you should follow it with a good moisturizer, as it can be a bit drying. I love love love this product!</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; is similar to a watered down lotion with a splash of slime. It is oily and just sits on the skin. When you rub it in it leaves streaks and you really have to apply pressure to avoid leaving visual residue on your face. It smells like original Elmer&#x27;s glue and leaves my face greasy, oily, and shiny. I have noticed a \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; effect but I deduced that is from the tackiness of this concotion, not the actual lifting. This product was not worth the $36 I spent here on Amazon and I feel sorry for whoever actually bought it from the website for $150. Do not waste your money</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this consistently since I&#x27;m currently using other products. I haven&#x27;t notice any difference to my visage. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to rate this when everyone is raving about it so much. My face hasn&#x27;t gotten bright or smoother. I have normal to dry skin and its not pretty with all the dry patches. I&#x27;m not yet done with the jar but hopefully results will show soon.</li>
    <li> This product is not worth o buy. If you have a sensitive skin this gives you rash, and dry your skin. And does smell like glue</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the complaints about this product. Maybe some people have purchased counterfeits? Contrary to what I have read in other reviews, the cream 1. Smells lovely 2. Is easy to apply, absorbs immediately 3. Leaves no residue 4. Is not slimy&lt;br /&gt;As soon as it is absorbed I can feel a tightening effect on my face. I have only been using it for about ten days, so I have no opinion yet on the long term effect, but I really like the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I do agree that the quoted retail price is outrageous and no product short of one that completely eliminates all wrinkles is worth that kind of expense.</li>
    <li> Bought it through Groupon but got serious skin irritation, very itchy all over the face. I never had any skin issues with other cosmetics before.  This is the first bad skin side effect in my entire life. Do not nuy.</li>
    <li> Who needs any other facial cream. This product keeps your face clear and smooth. It also gets rid of lines from aging and the sun. Would never give it up.</li>
    <li> Love this face cream. I use it for my day and night moisturizer. I also love the fact that it is made with 70% organic ingredients. It has made a big difference in the tone of my skin. My face is much firmer now than before my using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;What is really important to me is the fact that I was able to purchase this cream on Amazon for a great price.</li>
    <li> this is the best moisturizer i have ever tried in this price range. i have a very sensitive dry skin especially around my eyes. this moisturizer quenches my skin during the winter time and it doesn&#x27;t sting. i have only used this for four days now and i feel that it is working. my skin doesn&#x27;t peel anymore and the irritation is already subsiding. this works better than the prescription ointment that i got from my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> It was ok. Didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
    <li> still paid too much for it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and I really don&#x27;t see any changes in my fine lines or skin condition. It has a pungent cosmetic smell to it that is annoying to other people. And the cream is sticky. I have to put a moisturizer on after because it doesn&#x27;t seem to soak into the skin. It feels like it lays on top. The jar is pretty big so it will last a while - unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I first ordered this from Social Living and have used it once a day along with another moisturizing product since then. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I loved it until someone asked me if I&#x27;d had &amp;#34;something done&amp;#34; to my skin to make it look so good. I didn&#x27;t realize it did look and feel so good until it was brought to my attention!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 66 years old and my only concession to make-up is permanent eye-liner and B&amp;B cream. Otherwise it&#x27;s just my skin care regimen. I would never have paid the retail price of $150 for the Michael Todd product, but now I would if I had to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read other reviews that didn&#x27;t like the consistency, but I&#x27;ve not noticed anything unusual about it. I don&#x27;t find it &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; or in any way unpleasant. I do use a moisturizer over it because my skin doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;moisturized&amp;#34; without it. I just dot the Knu cream all over my face and neck and then gently blend it all in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Fantastic...really makes my skin awesome...just can&#x27;t afford $100 for jar.  It was $49.99 when I bought it.</li>
    <li> I used a couple of jars of this product and thought it was okay until the last 2 jars were so thick that I couldn&#x27;t spread it and it looked like zinc going on with a white film. I called customer service but if it wasn&#x27;t purchased within 30 days( I had stock piled it)for two months, they wouldn&#x27;t refund the money. Also I would have had to pay shipping and insurance so it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I wrote a review with 2 stars and they refused to publish it.&lt;br /&gt;I really couldn&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I found the cream and serum works for me, but my latest interaction with the site/customer service, the order screen charged me for the full tax on the $150 face lift, when I used the Living Social code.  That&#x27;s $12.15 for my free jar (after paying LS).  And shipping has gone up, although only 50 cents.  Complained to Michael Todd CS and they said it was in the fine print (not about being charged tax on full price of item) and they argued and argued with me.  I paid for $5.50 ship on original LS promo--guess MT feels they can change anything and not honor agreement.  Complained to LS and they refunded my coupon completely, so I will buy elsewhere.  Maybe better to buy on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a month and immediately ordered two more. I am in love. Had used another product that everyone was talking about for 3 months (nerium) and was greatly disappointed. For 1/2 the price and so much better results this product is amazing. I highly recommend it to everyone and to all my friends. The results are fabulous and it does so much more for my skin than I ever expected. A loyal fan now of this product from this site. Wow!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream from Groupon.  I was extremely happy to try this product on my face, after I read all the good reviews and ingredient of this product.  The list of ingredient sounds fantastic.  So, I could not wait to try this magical cream as it was mentioned by DR. Todd.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have to tell you about my background.  I used to be a fashion model and now \\&quot;I can&#x27;t mention my age\\&quot; because I look 15-20 years younger than I look.  I have always taken great care of myself and skin.  So, I know my skin better than anyone else.  I know \\&quot;What works and what doesn&#x27;t\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I trusted Dr. Todd&#x27;s testimonies and videos.  So, I gave the benefit of the doubt to an un-known brand with good PR and advertised in Groupon.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for one week, I started feeling irritation on my cheeks.  I tried to ignore it.  I kept on using the best and number one rated SPF that we can use in California.  I also kept on covering myself by wearing a big hat.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the outcome turned very bad.  My skin around my cheek and cheekbones did become thinner and red.  I honestly feel the irritation constantly.  After a few weeks, I tried to stop using it.  And after 4 days of not using it, my skin is not as irritated anymore.  The redness is starting to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that Dr. Todd should not advertise every product like this one for every skin types.  I know that he mentions that it does have AHA on the website only and we should avoid sun exposure and wear sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;But that is too wrong.  Dr. Todd should start categorizing his products by skin types.  I know that he is trying to sell and make a profit from this one product with a very low cost on Groupon and Living Social.  But he is keeping the warnings away from potential buyers, because he just wants to mass sale!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my honest review.  I hope that Dr. Todd will not find this offensive and remove it.  Instead, he should take my word of advice and prevent further harm to his clients.  Some resourceful clients might not be as nice and honest as I am.  They might take legal actionss.  Some resourceful clients might not be as nice and honest as I am.  They might take legal actions</li>
    <li> This stuff is a joke. I can&#x27;t believe all the great reviews. I tried it thorough a groupon and see it&#x27;s now cheaper on amazon. This product looks, smells, and feels exactly like Elmer&#x27;s glue (no offense to Elmer&#x27;s). It leaves your skin feeling dry and tacky. It was a huge waste of money.  I wish I could give it a zero star.</li>
    <li> I  tried a fair amount of face creams for my sensitive, acne prone skin and this product did not irritate my skin whatsoever. I also purchased the knu serum at the same time, but after daily use I only noticed a difference from the cream. I apply twice a day and have seen a 90% reduction in my redness, dry skin and minimized pores.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Just wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey!  However, it does last a long time and it really works!</li>
    <li> Nothing spectacular......average......not bad.....not great.....it smells a bit like elmers glue with the same consistency.  I would not buy again.  Sorry</li>
    <li> I (male) have been using this product for a month now. I was attracted to the fact that it is \\&quot;mostly\\&quot; organic. However, the overriding issue is the problematic nature of its application.&lt;br /&gt;In my 15 years of applying product to my face I have NEVER had such a difficult time getting the product to absorb/eliminate the white film that is created when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;The process is so frustrating that it has caused me to never consider purchasing this again, even if it only cost 25 bucks! Also, I find that for 25 dollars I have found other more&lt;br /&gt;effective product (containing DMAE, ALA.VITMAN C ESTHER etc.) that applies rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;Next time Mike Todd do some Beta Testing with some real consumers before bringing to market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS Brilliant marketing move applying a $150.00 retail price to get suckers like me to think that somehow that equates with quality and then stealing it for only $25! LOL!</li>
    <li> This product seems to work better than any other similar products that I have tried. You have to make sure that after application  you make sure it has absorbed before you apply makeup!&lt;br /&gt;Wendy</li>
    <li> Best face cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I can even use it on my eye lids without irritation to my eyes. I wear it all day without ever feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the complaints about this product are about. THIS is an awesome product!! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m THRILLED!! Amazing product!!  Absorbs quickly. I love that this isn&#x27;t a greasy product. My skin isn&#x27;t shiny or slimy feeling. I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed!! I will continue to use this product!! BONUS A little goes a long way! The jar will last 3 or 4 months!!&lt;br /&gt;The Airless pump is awesome!! I get exactly how much product I need!!</li>
    <li> does exactly what it says! It just melt&#x27;s into your skin you can feel the results instantly, the serum is fabulous too!!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of the serum on groupon. Thougt it was a good price to try something new.  I really love this product. Works very well on lines around mouth and jaw line.  I would buy again.  use with my own daily face cream and make up.</li>
    <li> OMG the smell!!! I bought this through Groupon for $30 thinking I got a great deal so didn&#x27;t mind reading the fine print saying that it&#x27;s final sale! So now I&#x27;m stuck with this! I used only for my hands and arms and I have to breathe by my mouth when applying it. It is not even a good moisturizer, let alone an effective anti-aging product like it claims. I really think products that are final sale are just shady since the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t even believe in their products!!</li>
    <li> I found this product on Living Social for the same price and I ordered twice. My first jar, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed but I read more reviews and decided to reorder. The major difference Is that you have to rub the product onto your face, until it disappears. A small amount is all that is needed. I use it for my entire face including under my eyes. I also have had a few blemishes and I noticed it removed it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase as the price is fantastic and it will last for 3 months if used sparingly.</li>
    <li> Okay, first of all I purchased this also from Living Social and also received it from the Michael Todd store. I also found it very tightening and drying upon first application as opposed to previous purchases. I discovered you have to stir the cream and incorporate this tightening ingredient that seem to rise to the top. Since their ingredients are organic this doesn&#x27;t surprise me in the least as it it is not using emulsifiers etc. Try it. It makes a huge difference and the cream feels wonderful and does what it says. I have been using it for over a year and I am very picky and get bored but this one I try to buy whenever I can find a deal on it. It could be that batch was near an expiration date, and I think they should post expiration dates on these organic products. But for $25 dollars, I will be happy to stir the pot.</li>
    <li> Super great cream for my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the second jar I have purchased.  I love it; I can actually feel my skin tighten after I apply it.  I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This is the best I have ever used, I see a big difference in the wrinkles around my lips, several of my friends have ordered it because they thought my skin looked so pretty</li>
    <li> I have to address some things about this product, since the reviews on it are all very extreme.&lt;br /&gt;* yes, it has an odd smell. It disappeared  within minutes thought, and wasn&#x27;t so offensive that it made me dislike the product. A bit of a glue type scent, but it&#x27;s not awful.&lt;br /&gt;* yes, it is &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; when first applied. It took about 5 minutes to absorb into my skin, after which my face felt incredibly soft!&lt;br /&gt;* you don&#x27;t need to apply a ton of this product. A small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having problem skin, I find this product to be excellent &amp; have no issues with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;The jar actually appears a bit smaller in the picture than it is when you receive it: nice surprise!</li>
    <li> I bought this, like a lot of people, via Living Social, and I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price! The product is much thinner than I anticipated. It really reminds me of Elmer&#x27;s glue in both smell and consistency. The thing I can&#x27;t get over is that there&#x27;s no SPF in an anti-aging product! I suppose that&#x27;s my fault for not doing research, but I don&#x27;t have the patience to apply two face products before I even get to make up, especially since this one does take a while to absorb. I will say I like the texture of my skin, but not enough to continue to pay the premium price.</li>
    <li> I too got this at the $25 discounted price.  At first I was in love with it, but after about a week I noticed flaky, dry patches on my cheeks.  I think this is best suited for oily skin, mine is on the dry side.  But it does lift and it didn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive, rosacea skin.  Maybe even toned redness down a bit.  I bought a 2nd jar when it was on sale (30% off retail), because it does work.  I just mix it with a touch of my moisturizer, which helps the dryness.  I agree with the Elmer&#x27;s glue smell, texture!  But it fades after a few minutes and something has to give it the lift effect.  A little does go a long way, don&#x27;t slather this stuff on your face or you will feel \\&quot;glued\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because of the extreme discount on living social, but I think they did that to hook us!!! This product has improved my fine lines by 75% at least.  Almost100% on my laugh lines. It&#x27;s literally the best thing ever. I am a user for life. I was about ready for Botox. This has bought me a few years at least.</li>
    <li> There is nothing on the market to erase wrinkles. This doesn&#x27;t work either. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. Any moisturizer is good for the face.</li>
    <li> I have used this is the past and loved it, but this time the cream if &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. I paid good money for it and have requested a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I do hope it&#x27;s honored.</li>
    <li> Not sure how this works, but my face appears healthier and I look more rested whenever I use this - which is most days.</li>
    <li> I bought this on living social at a great price just trying to slow this aging a bit. It feels like it tightened immediately. I am seeing definite improvement in my lines and even tho I work nightshift, I don&#x27;t look a hundred anymore! I will def buy more and amazon is the best price I have found.</li>
    <li> I too was skeptical of its effectiveness, but the problem was not using it regularly. After 2-3 weeks of using it daily then twice daily, my fine lines are fading!</li>
    <li> The Knu Anti-aging Face Lift Cream comes in a 1.7-oz airless jar. The jar has a pump that dispenses the cream. Simply remove the cap and push own on the pump to remove the cream. This keeps the cream fresh and germ free. The cream is dispensed evenly through a small hole. I does not shot out and make a mess at all. You can control how much cream is dispensed. The cream is nice and thick. Any skin type can benefit from this nourishing cream. It is best suited for dry, sensitive, pigmented or wrinkled skin complexions. It does have a smell that can&#x27;t pinpoint. It&#x27;s pretty strong but a pleasant refreshing smell. It makes your face feel like you have been to the spa. It does not leave your face greasy. I tent to breakout with a lot products. This has not caused any breakouts or irritation to my skin. It leaves my skin feeling very clean and refreshed. I like to use this after I get out of the shower. I let the cream dry for a few minutes and then apply my makeup. The smell alone gets me energized in the mornings. I also like to use this at nighttime before bed. It make my skin feel so clean. Since this product is not watered down like others, you don&#x27;t have to use much at all. This bottle will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that my skin has started to look more firm and my eye wrinkles have diminished. I love the fact that this product is not tested on animals and made in the USA. I would definitely recommend this product. It is well worth the money. This is like a facial spa in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this anti-aging face lift but I did get my product in a different container than the one showing here. My container had a pump and the top for easy dispense. Other than that, it&#x27;s the exact same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I did not receive any other form of compensation. I only recommend products that I would myself.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference after 2 weeks. It only takes a small amount. I will use this product forever.  thanks so much</li>
    <li> My daughter had been suffering with terrible acne for years we spent a fortune and tried everything we could. I was recommened Michael Todd&#x27;s acne regimen and we used the Knu as a moisturizer to try to repair the damage to her skin at the same time. Success, finally after years of heart-ache (only the mother of a teen suffering from severe acne would understand). Highly recommend the acne regimen and the Knu. Can&#x27;t praise Michael Todd enough!!!</li>
    <li> I bought the coupon for this cream on livingsocial and got it pretty fast .soo far i did notice some &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; in my skin( medium color skin ,age 30) my overall face look much better and the smell isnt soo bad as other reviews i ve read this seems to me quite normal and texture is bit different of this cream but as soon as u apply it ,it dries up pretty fast i have a combinaton skin . Soo far i like it its my second week using it .my decoloration also got better with this . Happy with my results.</li>
    <li> I have acne and oily prone skin and found that this product worked great for me! My mom actually loves it as well. Now I know you can use this even before applying your makeup in the morning but I do like to use it more as a night cream. It feels nice and light weight on my skin and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. As any other anit-aging products, it&#x27;s hard to tell if the anti-aging portion is working right off the bat but I can say that I do feel a firming of the skin which I do like. It doesn&#x27;t leave weird residue on my skin and absorbs into my skin quite nicely. Definitely will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> Buyers beware. I think I just spent my money on what smells and feels like Elmer&#x27;s glue. Very expensive Elmer&#x27;s glue.</li>
    <li> I bought this product via Living Social like a lot of the other reviewers. I love it! It does kind of smell like Elmer&#x27;s glue, but the smell goes away in minutes. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and love the way my skin looks now. I used to get little red blotchy spots and now they&#x27;re starting to disappear. When I apply it, I instantly feel my skin tightening up. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll continue to use the product for a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 jars from groupon. It has a light scent but doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Its consistency is sort of like a creamy gel glue, and it works like a glue to temporarily tighten my skin, but at the same time it also makes my skin dry and dehydrated. I have to layer my regular moisturizer on top of it. Because of its high retail price I really wanted this cream to work, but in fact I am disappointed. It does nothing to my skin except for the initial tightness and then the dehydration. I have used up almost a jar (lasted more than 2 months) and see no improvement on fine lines, acne scars, pores, etc. As a moisturizer it&#x27;s not even moisturizing. Can&#x27;t believe they set the retail price at $150. Also I found this company pretty shady. They won&#x27;t approve reviews of 3 stars or less (my review never showed up on their site). I also saw comments posted by the company on some blog sites that argue with bloggers who posted negative reviews of the product. I mean that&#x27;s a pretty aggressive move for a company, and it shows they lack confidence in their own products. How can I trust them when I see this as a consumer?</li>
    <li> I love it...glad I tried it...feels great. Very light silky texture. Clean smell, my skin is smooth and can breath.</li>
    <li> I am convinced the good reviews are fakes. This product isn&#x27;t even a good moisturizer. It surely does NOTHING for the skin. Fine lines still there. This cream smells funny, is an odd consistency, and it itches my skin. I purchased it off Living Social on a whim. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake as me!</li>
    <li> I bought this off Living Social at an unbelievably great deal! I think it was less then $25 and on the website its $150!!!!&lt;br /&gt;(Should&#x27;ve known) Anyway, it smells terrible! Its not 100% organic and it takes awhile to absorb into the skin and once it does it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the skin but make it smell stinky! WASTE! WASTE! WASTE!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 1.5 month. I am 35 and have been having acne break outs since my teens. This is the first topical cream that&#x27;s made a big positive difference without leaving my skin dry and flaky (and I&#x27;ve tried a ton of others). It is also not greasy like other anti-wrinkle creams I&#x27;ve tried. The large pores on my cheeks look smaller. The lines on my forehead and around my eyes look smoother. I only use it at night because it does leave a slight residue. Has a mild soapy smell, not off-putting to me or my husband. I plan to get another one of these when mine runs out.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and have noticed lots of fine lines lately and this product definitely seems to tighten those areas. I also use a filler product over the face lift for extra coverage.</li>
    <li> This is the best night cream I&#x27;ve tried.  It tightens, lifts and smooths, even around eyes and mouth.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but no so much as many other name brands.  I have very sensitive skin, and this cream has never irritated me.  I will continue to use unless price increases drastically.</li>
    <li> I toyed around with the idea of ordering this stuff for nearly a month before I just bit the bullet and did it. At first I was weirded out by it because the texture is unlike any other face cream I have ever used. And even though I thought I was using it sparingly at first, I wasn&#x27;t. This stuff is THICK and a little goes a long way. I have been using it every night for 3 months now and I LOVE it. My skin tone has improved, my acne marks are fading (slowly but surely) and it&#x27;s almost like my cheek fat is diminishing...my face feels and appears more slender by my cheek bones. That could just be the improvement in skin tone though that makes it appear that way. Either way, I am so happy with this little wonder cream and I will keep reordering as long as the price is right.</li>
    <li> This product (in my opinion) is GREAT. The product is easy to use has no weird smell and you can feel it work. I have not tried it as a mask yet but, I certainly will. I love it so much it carry a small jar of it with me for touch ups especially for the neck and under chin areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price and the results make me a very happy girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peaches</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase. Will be back to get more. They say, it helps reduce wrinkle lines and also firms and tighten the skin.</li>
    <li> Smells bgad, made my face break out; not sure what the other 10% non organic items are and really do not care.</li>
    <li> I like it. It&#x27;s no miracle worker, I&#x27;m 61 and do find it doing well, not ready to try anything else. Do be careful when applying other products over it. I used something..a moisturizer...which must have had an ingredient in it that was not compatible and my cheeks turned beat red one morning. Stopped using both together and in a few days back to normal. Something you have to be careful  with combining any 2 products.</li>
    <li> Great product. Others have started to ask me what different have you done to yourself? I believe they suspect a face lift.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the worst moisturizers I have ever tried. I am so glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price for this on his website. I think it retails for around 100 bucks. I wouldn&#x27;t even pay 5 bucks for this. The bottom line is that it just doesn&#x27;t moisturize. I use this mainly at night. I would first use a toner, then a serum and then this moisturizer. After a few minutes, I find myself feeling a tightness in my skin that&#x27;s uncomfortable and I always end up applying a different moisturizer. I know there are products that tightens your face but they don&#x27;t dry it up like this product does. The thing is I am not a snob when it comes to moisturizers but I really can&#x27;t stand this product. Save your money and invest in something else. Trust me!</li>
    <li> When I purchased my first Jar, I noticed a difference in about three days. I was so excited I quickly ordered a second jar. I am 41 years old and have spent a small fortune buying creams for my skin..  Many break my skin out.  This one didnt have any horrible side effects and really tightened my skin. I have since suggested it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream from Living Social and i am extremely pleased. My skin looks amazing !! I already had pretty descent skin and noticed its even better since using this. I agree with one of the other reviews you don&#x27;t need alot a little goes a long way and you can put a regular moisturizer on top of this , I dont,  but I also apply this around my eyes and put my regular eye cream on top of this.&lt;br /&gt;I would never pay $150.00 as the companies website charges . If you read the ingredients the main one is Aloe .</li>
    <li> I was reluctant at first for trying this product, being a man, but my wife convinced me to follow through on it and I finally caved. To my surprise, this product has done wonders for my old, sensitive skin. I&#x27;m not the only one satisfied by this product, my wife has thougth of it as a saving grace for maximum comfort. All I do is apply once in the morning and once at night (in small quantities) and BAM! I&#x27;m not some wrinkly, old miser anymore!</li>
    <li> Love it!  My skins feels tight while using this Michael Todd product!</li>
    <li> I bought the KNU and it said that I would see results instantly. This in fact was not true. It took almost 3.5 weeks but I did see excellent results. Just wish they would have been more honest about the required length of time of use to see results.&lt;br /&gt;I give it five stars for results but only three stars for how fast it works</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what other people received, but I ordered this via Living Social and have not noticed any bad smell, feel or anything else some people are complaining about.  I&#x27;m a guy who has never used cream of any kind.  Getting ready to turn 46 and I look young for my age, but I have a little sun damage and some wrinkles on my face/forehead.  I thought this was a good opportunity to try something at a discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... just using it one time per day (not twice as recommended) has worked amazingly well.  The wrinkles that were on my forehead are almost all gone.  My wife used it only two times and she has noticed a wrinkle on her forehead going away as well. I can see us fighting over the bottle in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I WILL be buying refills of this item on Amazon and you&#x27;ll see a verified purchase from me in a few months for sure.  I can see why they put it on Living Social, because I know a lot of people like me will become customers from it.  I was very disappointed that the Living Social deal ended, because after I saw how well it worked, I tried to order more, only to see \\&quot;deal expired!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t listen to the naysayers.  This stuff works... it takes very little each application... and it&#x27;s worth the price.  (The Amazon price seems much more reasonable than the $150 on the Michael Todd Organics website when I was ordering with the LS voucher for sure!)</li>
    <li> Really works.  I saw a difference almost immediately.  I used it with the Knu Serum and am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Bought this KNU cream about 2 weeks ago from Living Social also,  hoping it would improve some of the brown marks and fine lines around my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now with the antioxidant serum I bought from them also, and I totally can&#x27;t even beleive the results. My brown marks actually daded already and I can&#x27;t wait to see more improvement. It absorbs really well so I don&#x27;t have any issues with that at all, and it smells fine to me.It actually smells pretty neutral to me. No real scent to it, but I kinda like that cause I know it doesn&#x27;t have any added fragrance that can irritate my skin. Can&#x27;t imagine going without this product!</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;ll start buy saying that I like that this product is \\&quot;mostly\\&quot; organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I ordered it thruogh a groupon or living social deal. I can&#x27;t remember which one. Brought the price down from $125 to $25 so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try since I love facial skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the smell however, I really don&#x27;t like the way it makes my skin feel - almost like it sits on top of instead of in my skin &amp; leaves it feeling dry instead of giving me a moisture surge. It may work better for people with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t purchase it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from an online discount retailer because of the significant markdown and various online reviews.  This product is amazing!  I am always trying new products to find one that actually changes your skin.  This one does!  I use it in the morning (face, eyes, neck, chest, hands) under my day cream with SPF.  I use it under my eyes then apply an eye serum because it tends to get the area too tight and dry for makeup, alone it actually makes your under eyes look worse after I use a concealer.  So use a good eye serum if you use this around your eye area.  I then use it again at night but I put on a bit more than is necessary.  The fine lines under my eyes have softened but the crow&#x27;s feet are almost gone.  The sagging from nose to mouth seems to have filled-in alot.  I also put a good layer around my lips and just on my lips.  My overall complexion is tighter (most noticed on my neck, chest and hands) and my face is brighter, plumper and most definitely smoother.  I have just finished my first jar and will order another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any strange smell but I did notice that around a month now the cream seems to be thicker. Also, the first couple of days, my skin felt a bit tingling not really a burning so I used less of the cream until this sensation went away then began using what I would as a normal amount.  I haven&#x27;t really been monitoring the \\&quot;U\\&quot; on my forehead as much because I have bangs, so that area is not that noticeable for me and can&#x27;t really comment on how it works to eliminate Botox in that area.</li>
