      <li>I have never found a foundation that works better than theirs!  </li>
      <li>Kind of orangey</li>
      <li>They product was fine!</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>

      <li>Mary Kay has a very wide variety of colors and formulas that make it easy to fine the perfect product for anyone.</li>
      <li>But other then the wait, it is a good product and a good price</li>

      <li>I love Mary Kay products, but most especially their foundation.  </li>
      <li>For my skin color, I can use just a bit where I want on my face and it blends in nicely with the rest of my skin, so I only need to use a couple drops here and there, then blend in with a sponge and use a finishing powder.  </li>
      <li>i have tried many different foundation choices and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>The coverage is really good without looking heavy or caked on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m naturally quite pale and have a lot of difficulty finding foundation that matches my skin tone, but Ivory 100 is a great match for me.</li>
      <li>It covers nicely without giving an orange tint that is typical for foundation.</li>
      <li>Not heavy nor greasy.</li>
      <li>Product was over 5 years old.</li>
      <li>I would recommend Mary Kay to anyone who is not pleased with the foundation that they are currently using and are looking for an outstanding product.</li>
      <li>i really just thought this was average.</li>
      <li>Throughout the years I&#x27;ve received numerous compliments on my complexion and it really comes down to the Mary Kay Foundation.</li>
      <li>I have very light, thin skin and was tired of trying to find the right color match that didn&#x27;t look like a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;.  </li>
