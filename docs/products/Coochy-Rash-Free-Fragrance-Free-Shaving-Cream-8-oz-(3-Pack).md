      <li>I&#x27;ve used everything to try and help my razorbumps and irritation from specialized shaving creams to fancy razors nothing has done the trick like the coochy while i&#x27;m still not 100% free of razor bumps i&#x27;ve seen great improvement that the other creams couldn&#x27;t provide.</li>

      <li>This product does exactly what it is intended to do.</li>

      <li>All the raves about leaving skin ultra soft are true.</li>

      <li>I especially appreciate the mild smell and</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shave cream.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I purchased this and it fixed all of those issues.  </li>
      <li>but it does not prevent razor rash completely.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin like she does.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; it never gives me bumps or razor burn.</li>
      <li>I know that has sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but Rash Free is not completely accurate.</li>
      <li>I really like it and it lasts for a long time too.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t go back to regular shaving cream in those certain areas.</li>
      <li>Provides a smooth shave, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>I will only shave sensitive areas using this product.</li>

    <li> This stuff works, but if you don&#x27;t reapply it while not in the shower, you will get bumps a few days later. I know it&#x27;s made to be rinsed off, but that is the only way I have found to keep it from getting bumpy. I would suggest just buying something to put on after you shave to keep the bumps and ingrowns away. My main complaint is that the pumps don&#x27;t even work! Super annoying.</li>
    <li> All the raves about leaving skin ultra soft are true. I especially appreciate the mild smell and how easy this cream is to wash off. Nothing greasy about it, and it doesn&#x27;t compete with the fragrance of my cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the pump head snapped off the first time I tried to use this product. I think I was sufficiently careful -- I mean I don&#x27;t usually have trouble with pump bottles!&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend Coochy? Well, yes, but handle with care!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. It&#x27;s her favorite shaving cream. If you have sensitive skin like she does. Then use this. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from a adult toy party a while ago for wayyy more money than I paid here. Love this stuff and it completely prevents razor burn for me no matter how often I shave.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it is intended to do. I will only shave sensitive areas using this product. This is a must have!</li>
    <li> The wife started shaving and was having problems with shave bumps.  Provides a smooth shave, and a little goes a long way.  I like to shave with it too.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product is fragrance free, and works really well. My husband&#x27;s main complaint is that he finds it hard to rinse it out of his razor. I will keep using it, but I am not sure if he will. It is a great value.</li>
    <li> I think it is a great shave cream but it does not prevent razor rash completely. It does better then most but Rash Free is not completely accurate.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years. Ordered it from amazon &amp; was excited about the 3 pack. What I didn&#x27;t realize is that they are 8oz bottles. Kinda disappointing, but it was my fault for not reading the specs. Great product though. I have sensitive skin &amp; it never gives me bumps or razor burn.</li>
    <li> Best shave cream for use on the body and face!&lt;br /&gt;Useful for tough facial hair as well!</li>
    <li> Not only is this stuff the best (and recommended by my doctor) for my sensitive skin, but my fiancé uses it on his face as well and barely gets razor burn at all anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Won&#x27;t go back to regular shaving cream in those certain areas. Cleared everything up quickly. Have no complaints. Left skin smooth and rash free. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> ok i tried this at my friend&#x27;s house when i needed to shave and then realize i didn&#x27;t break out so decided to use this as my shave cream, yes i am a guy and when i shave my neck breaks out like nuts, NOT ANYMORE! i absolutely would recommend this to anyone who wants to shave bump free! it feels like it softens hair well and creates very glidy surface so razor doesn&#x27;t cut or irritate you skin, i actually used to wash my neck and face with bunch of salicylic acids followed by triple antibiotic cream to keep bumps away - after using this cream i do nothing i simply rinse it and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff! Found it by chance over a year ago and bought it both because it was discounted and I was desperate for something to stop these ingrowns. It works wonders. I use it to maintain my bikini line and I was so shocked at the day and night difference between Coochy and regular shaving cream. It gave me a closer shave, a more comfortable shave, prevented ingrowns, and kept my skin from becoming dry and irritated. A good cream definitely is as important as a good razor and Coochy fills the role.</li>
    <li> This product was built up to the skies by other reviewers, but once I got it, I was extremely displeased that&lt;br /&gt;it has such a poor lather.  I have a few other products like Bigelow and Spieck which are heads and shoulders&lt;br /&gt;above this product.  I don&#x27;t know what other people like about this cream, but I would advise not to waste your&lt;br /&gt;money.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream ever...it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job and leaves my legs silky smooth. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t shave with anything except Coochy Cream because my skin is super sensitive. This product works pretty good! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone (female AND male) that suffers from razor burn ANYWHERE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for awhile and was unsure if it had changed when I saw the new bottle, but it really is the same stuff, just better packaging.</li>
    <li> I had heard about this product from a friend.  I am glad I did!  I have always had sensitive skin and hated shaving!  I am in love!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years.I use to get a rash but with this you don&#x27;t have to worry about that. I love this product and will continue to use it as long as you keep selling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you for such a fantastic product&lt;br /&gt;  Cindy Carpenter</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this shave cream. You get a really great deal and it works perfectly. If you&#x27;re looking for a intimate shave cream this is it!</li>
    <li> This is good shave cream but keep in mind if you want something to lather then this is not a lathering type of shave cream. It almost feels like shaving with conditioner it makes skin feel smoother and allows for a close shave all while minimizing razor rash. I really like it and it lasts for a long time too. A small amount goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I think this product is safer for shaving down there than the regular shaving cream that you can buy at grocery stores and pharmacies.  Seems to be easier on urinary tract which can be an issue for the ladies.  Coochy rash free, fragrance free shaving cream is a good buy</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I like that it is fragrance free. I use this to shave my face in the mornings and like that I don&#x27;t have to deal with cuts and marks on my face before going in to work. Will definitely continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used everything to try and help my razorbumps and irritation from specialized shaving creams to fancy razors nothing has done the trick like the coochy while i&#x27;m still not 100% free of razor bumps i&#x27;ve seen great improvement that the other creams couldn&#x27;t provide. Since listening to my wife our marriage hasn&#x27;t been better!</li>
    <li> Great Price for this amazing product. I have used this for many years and it is amazing shaving cream and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Highly recommend. Much cheaper than buying in-store . I have been using this for a few years now and woulnt switch.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on reviews by guys using it to shave their face.  I always broke out, had razor burn, or would bleed a lot on my neck area after shaving.  I purchased this and it fixed all of those issues.  Now I recommend it to anybody I know that has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this and I am so excited that I got the three pack.  In addition to the close shave and no razor burn, I love that it is unscented.  Great product and an awesome price!</li>
