      <li>it made it so smooth and gave it some curl as well.  </li>
      <li>A good idea, in theory, but just implemented with a major flaw in the product design.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to use it when it came</li>
      <li>It helped to know the simple steps to successfully use this styling tool.</li>
      <li>This brush is super light and the bristles doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair while you maneuver it through your mane while styling.</li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t tangle, it helps to dry quick, and it&#x27;s light and easy to manage.  </li>
      <li>I recomend very much this product i have coatse hair</li>
      <li>but of course, I thought I&#x27;d check out Amazon first.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was too big</li>
      <li>Dries my short hair quickly and smoothly.</li>
      <li>I love this new round brush, I have very fine hair, but this really helps alot when</li>
      <li>That said, I actually do like the rubber handle because it makes it easy to grip.  </li>
      <li>but it was still too large.</li>
      <li>I really like this brush, and would rate it 4.5 stars if I could.  </li>
      <li>Either way, I really like this brush.  </li>
      <li>really disappointing&lt;</li>
      <li>So I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
      <li>I have other Olivia Garden brushes that I still love -</li>
      <li>It gets the job done quickly, but it pulls my hair at the same time.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s no problem with it &#x27;cleanly&#x27; running through long hair without snagging or pulling!  </li>
      <li>I am finally able to blow dry and style my hair (vs drying it and having to flat iron and curl separately).</li>
      <li>I measured the brush from bristle to bristle and also from the center circle, wasnt sure which measure to use, I went with the smaller size</li>
      <li>They dry hair quickly and without pulling.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s actually fun now to dry my hair - a chore I typically do not like!!!  </li>
      <li>It is most useful to use duckbill clips and dry a small section at a time.</li>
      <li>The tiny bit of extra time invested in putting in clips actually makes the whole process more expedient and efficient overall.</li>
      <li>upon unwrapping this brush, I found out that nearly 30% of the tips are bent in all directions...</li>
      <li>then I have ever spent on a brush, but worth it.</li>
      <li>I suggest reading a quick tutorial on using a round brush if you are new to this.</li>
      <li>My long hair dries much quicker using this brush compared to an old boar-hair brush I was using.  </li>
      <li>It gets insanely hot- be careful because if you touch your neck or something with it, you&#x27;ll nearly burn yourself.</li>
      <li>the diameter is a little smaller than I would like though and it would have cost more to send it back with shipping and restock fee than I paid for it!</li>
      <li>I have naturally wavy hair, and this brush helps me get it straight and dry in a hurry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not rating it 5 stars because sometimes the rubber handle grips my long hair, which is something that I could probably avoid if I really tried, but I don&#x27;t feel like I should have to be super-careful when brushing my hair in order to avoid it getting caught on rubber.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this brush a few times but it is much better than the other brushes I have tried</li>
      <li>I have had my original one for at least five years and it still does the job.</li>
      <li>but it works well on my long, fine (but thick) hair.</li>

    <li> I really like this brush, and would rate it 4.5 stars if I could.  I&#x27;m not rating it 5 stars because sometimes the rubber handle grips my long hair, which is something that I could probably avoid if I really tried, but I don&#x27;t feel like I should have to be super-careful when brushing my hair in order to avoid it getting caught on rubber.  That said, I actually do like the rubber handle because it makes it easy to grip.  So I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much.  Either way, I really like this brush.  My long hair dries much quicker using this brush compared to an old boar-hair brush I was using.  I can&#x27;t believe it took me so many years to buy a decent brush and I would recommend this one to anyone.</li>

    <li> Love this brush. It allows you to blow dry your hair in half the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brush a few times but it is much better than the other brushes I have tried</li>
    <li> upon unwrapping this brush, I found out that nearly 30% of the tips are bent in all directions... really disappointing&lt;br /&gt;It rendered it useless. I practically wasted my money here!</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this brush and I immediately bought one for myself. Works great and looks pretty fancy!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Easy to style and doesn&#x27;t catch or pull hair</li>
    <li> During my last hair cut, my stylist used this brush on my hair and I loved how it looked.  She told me I could buy the brush at the salon - but of course, I thought I&#x27;d check out Amazon first.  As suspected, the price on Amazon was almost 50% less than in the salon so I immediately bought it.  I was so excited to use it when it came and it didn&#x27;t disappoint!  I have other Olivia Garden brushes that I still love - but this one not only dried my hair in half the time - it made it so smooth and gave it some curl as well.  I have medium to long hair so I was concerned that this 1 3/4\\&quot; size would get knotted in my hair - but not at all.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for grabbing the hair and curling it and there&#x27;s no problem with it &#x27;cleanly&#x27; running through long hair without snagging or pulling!  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it and it&#x27;s actually fun now to dry my hair - a chore I typically do not like!!!  Would definitely recommend!  Quick update - purchased another brush for my sister and she also loves it!</li>
    <li> This brush is pretty good...the diameter is a little smaller than I would like though and it would have cost more to send it back with shipping and restock fee than I paid for it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works like magic!!  It smooths my hair and looks like I just came from the salon! Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the brush but I have long hair so it gets caught up in the handle...and snags my hair. Poor design! in case you&#x27;re wondering how long my hair is...it&#x27;s about 10 inches past my shoulders.</li>
    <li> Really reduces fly aways and static. Makes hair smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a wonderful brush that broke. This is not my favorite item. It gets the job done quickly, but it pulls my hair at the same time. It gets insanely hot- be careful because if you touch your neck or something with it, you&#x27;ll nearly burn yourself. Still hunting for the perfect brush.</li>
    <li> Dries my short hair quickly and smoothly.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this brush. I felt as though it made my already thin hair appear even thinner and contributed to a &amp;#34;straw-like&amp;#34; texture of my ends.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Makes styling my crazy hair easy.  I would recommend this to my friends.  Leaves your hair silky feeling .</li>
    <li> Like it very much very nice quality and like the way style my hair. I recomend very much this product i have coatse hair</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any decrease in drying time, nor is my hair shinier or less fly away. But it does brush my hair and helps work out the random wavy bits.</li>
    <li> Good brush for long hair. Cuts down on drying time</li>
    <li> I have fine shoulder length hair, and this brush works great. It is more money then I have ever spent on a brush, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I saw this at my hairdresser&#x27;s and loved what it did for my hair. While I may not be as skilled as my hairdresser, it still works just as good</li>
    <li> I love this new round brush, I have very fine hair, but this really helps alot when&lt;br /&gt;I blow out</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought this brush, but it&#x27;s actually the same brush my stylist uses to dry my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t tangle, it helps to dry quick, and it&#x27;s light and easy to manage.  I wish I would have found this brush years ago!</li>
    <li> This brush is AMAZING!!!!! The bristles are shaped in such a way that keeps the hair on it while blow drying. Also, very good quality, I use this on clients hair all the time and the bristles hold up through VERY hot and often blow-drys.</li>
    <li> The brush was exactly as I expected except for the size. I already have a smaller one that I wanted to replace.. I measured the brush from bristle to bristle and also from the center circle, wasnt sure which measure to use, I went with the smaller size but it was still too large. An explanation of how to measure size would be helpful.  I have had my original one for at least five years and it still does the job.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for me! I am finally able to blow dry and style my hair (vs drying it and having to flat iron and curl separately). It definitely helps me create volume by lifting the roots. Also a good value: it was reasonably priced and seems durable. My stylist recommended this brush, so that has to count for something! I recommend this brush to anyone wanting to style their hair as they dry it.</li>
    <li> This brush burns your neck! The metal part opposite the handle gave me a crescent shaped burn on my neck. It gets VERY hot!! Do ceramic instead.</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist and for the last 3 years this brand is my favorit for the brushes. Very nice!!!!</li>
    <li> Lightweight yet strong and easy to use. I love this brush!</li>
    <li> Love the Ion brush!  Works well on my hair which has a tendency to get wavy.  I recommend the brush.</li>
    <li> This is a great hairbrush.  I absolutely love that is has the hair pic, which stores in the handle.  I have naturally wavy hair, and this brush helps me get it straight and dry in a hurry.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush, easily controll your hair and smooth results!</li>
    <li> This brush is super light and the bristles doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair while you maneuver it through your mane while styling. It makes my unwieldy thick hair so much easier to style, and I really think it helps cut down on my blow drying time. I&#x27;m tempted to buy some of the other sizes too, or the Olivia Garden flat brush. Although that may have to be another splurge saved for another time.</li>
    <li> I have been really happy with the brush itself, as it has really made a difference regarding the the styling of my hair compared to the less expensive round brushes I have purchased at the drugstore in the past. However, I fail to see the purpose of including a pick attachment that does not stay&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;attached\\&quot; to the rest of the brush when not in use. The pick does not stay put in its little receptacle at the bottom of the brush handle, and falls out as soon as you lift the brush. As this was quite annoying, and the pick is reallt too small to stick in a drawer on its own without getting lost amongst everything else in the drawer, I just threw it out. A good idea, in theory, but just implemented with a major flaw in the product design.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect size and shape for my hair and was so reasonably priced. I love using it and my hair dries really fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the Olivia Garden Ceramic and Ion Thermal Brush, 1 3/8 Inch. (gray)  I liked the gray brush much better.  (You can highlight the name of the brush and add it to the Amazon search and the brush should come up.)  I have fine hair and found the gray brush to be much better at grabbing and holding my hair for styling.</li>
    <li> Good brush and easy to manage</li>
    <li> great bush. easy to use for stylish with a blowdryer</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was too big but it works well on my long, fine (but thick) hair. Gives me a beauty salon do in minutes! I love it.</li>
    <li> Great hair brush.  The brush does what it is supposed to do, style your hair without the hassle.</li>
    <li> This brush works really well to help straighten my short, thick, wavy hair when used in the final drying process. It is most useful to use duckbill clips and dry a small section at a time. The tiny bit of extra time invested in putting in clips actually makes the whole process more expedient and efficient overall. I suggest reading a quick tutorial on using a round brush if you are new to this. It helped to know the simple steps to successfully use this styling tool.</li>
