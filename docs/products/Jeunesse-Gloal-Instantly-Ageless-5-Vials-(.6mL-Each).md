      <li>Works ok....</li>
      <li>and I love the product.</li>
      <li>The product worked ok, after washing my face and drying I applied under both eyes to minimize the under eye bag appearance.</li>
      <li>or better yet deal with them , this product will not do the trick..</li>
      <li>Good, it really works.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, works pretty good, you have to put makeup on over it or it will kind of flake up.  </li>
      <li>Very quick service</li>
      <li>1 ampule is easily 5 applications.  </li>
      <li>It really works good if you know how use the right amount.</li>
      <li>I tried many times to get it right.</li>
      <li>Once applied don&#x27;t move your face and blow cool air over the area for a couple of minutes.</li>
      <li>Younger people who look good but are trying for perfection probably won&#x27;t get the effect they want.</li>
      <li>You could really see the patch (cream) on your face :) .</li>
      <li>this product does EXACTLY what it claims to do!  </li>
      <li>Also, it does leave a white film on the eyes, but fortunately I have a very light skin tone</li>
      <li>It is worth your money.</li>
      <li>I was pretty amazed.  </li>
      <li>Really!</li>
      <li>First the product pictured isn&#x27;t what I received.</li>
      <li>First of all I did not get vials as promised..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I only bought 5 vials.  </li>
      <li>Problem is that the effects do not last more than a couple of hours.  </li>
      <li>It really helps to soften wrinkles!</li>
      <li>ok but not enough product to really see a difference</li>
      <li>arrived very quickly and product actually works as promised.  </li>
      <li>Not so much on my under eyes but amazing round my mouth.  </li>
      <li>but otherwise not so much</li>
      <li>very temporary results.  </li>
      <li>but ... very noticeable ...</li>
      <li>Fast service, product as promised.</li>
      <li>Item delivered really fast.  </li>
      <li>It really reduced the bags under my eyes.</li>
      <li>Really does work.  </li>
      <li>Did not work very well</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
      <li>the product itself really does the job it promises.  </li>
      <li>I think some of the complaints are from people who used it incorrectly or who don&#x27;t really need this product.</li>
      <li>You get a full box for 74.95 plus shipping through an actual Jeunesse web page.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>Love these little vials</li>
      <li>It works like in the video but leaves a color and some kind of texture hard to cover with make up.</li>
      <li>The trick is to put it on one finger and gently rub it with another finger until the product turns clear before applying to your face.</li>
      <li>Each packet has enough product to apply twice under each eye so two days worth of product per packet.  </li>
      <li>I found that while it did smooth the wrinkles by my eyes if my face was deadpan, once I smiled, you could still see every wrinkle.</li>
      <li>Once it dries, you do feel it there, especially when you smile and your eyes crinkle.</li>
      <li>it goes right back to how it was before using anything.</li>
      <li>Finally, it did nothing for the fine lines around my eyes and if anything it made them bigger wrinkles with the product on them.  </li>
      <li>Seller did tape a note to the product stating that this is the new packaging from the company.</li>
      <li>It left a white powdery substance on my face with no change in my light wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>More is not better in this case.</li>
      <li>My first application at 4:30pm actually lasted until midnight</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>It is not feasible to use everyday, as it could be very expensive, but for those days when your eyes are really puffy or if you want to look your best for an event, it works really well!</li>
      <li>AND YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE.</li>
      <li>Maybe product was to old?</li>
      <li>At least thirty minutes would have been better than what it does.</li>
      <li>I was surprised for the results.  </li>
      <li>It was ok, but some of the instantly ageless TM seem to be dried up.  </li>
      <li>Did not see results in the product as indicated in the videos, glad to have only purchased a few sample vials.</li>
      <li>I could also live with that if only the product worked like it says.  </li>
      <li>WOW will definitely order again</li>
      <li>It works, just have to be careful not to use too much.  </li>
      <li>A small fan or a hair dryer on cool setting works well.</li>
      <li>Just long enough to let it dry, see the results, then get a picture  and as soon as you smile</li>
      <li>Saw some change, not sure it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Pretty much a waste of money.</li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s only enough in each one to barely do anything with.  </li>
      <li>are just a little puffy not even that much</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> just ok......seemed a little dried out.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Left a white film look on my face. Not what I expected</li>
    <li> Everybody was astounded by the results...wish it lasted longer</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful.  It leaves a film on your skin.  I&#x27;m glad I only bought 5 vials.  I tried it and will probably throw the other ones out.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this it is a scam it does not work my eyes are just a little puffy not even that much and it doesn&#x27;t work!!!! Anyone who says this works is lying they probably are getting paid or they work for the company</li>
    <li> It works by going on wet and tightening up when it dries, therefore, smoothing out the skin. Once it dries, you do feel it there, especially when you smile and your eyes crinkle. It also gets white and flakey. I found that while it did smooth the wrinkles by my eyes if my face was deadpan, once I smiled, you could still see every wrinkle.</li>
    <li> Really does work.  I have placed an additional order for the larger quantity!</li>
    <li> See no difference.  I was hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money!!</li>
    <li> Great product thank you</li>
    <li> First the product pictured isn&#x27;t what I received. Second it didn&#x27;t work like the videos stated.&lt;br /&gt;I saw no change .</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, works pretty good, you have to put makeup on over it or it will kind of flake up.  It was a sample gift for my mom and she liked it:)</li>
    <li> Did not see results in the product as indicated in the videos, glad to have only purchased a few sample vials.</li>
    <li> Fast service, product as promised.</li>
    <li> Would give this product no stars if I could ...anyway the people who write reviews are lying.either they sell the product or they get paid to lie. four of us different skin types tried the vials in four days , you get about 4 uses per vial/tube...the product is not a gel like  consistency like they claim its the consistency and look of denture cream....pink and grainy ..if youre like me who  suffers from bags..your better off seeing a plastic surgeon  ....or better yet deal with them , this product will not do the trick..it dries out your eyes burn skin and your left with dry patches around looking more like a raccoon furthermore can&#x27;t wear makeup its worthless and pointless.... Ladies I&#x27;m being honest ..trust me . save your money..and yes I clearly followed direction on applying a little. it looks like you have white glue around your eyes.doesnt do a thing this product is a scam</li>
    <li> I am still amazed every time that I use this!</li>
    <li> the sachets that I bought from here are a little old &amp; weak not nearly as good as the trial I used.</li>
    <li> First of all I did not get vials as promised..just pkts.  It was too caky after applying.  Maybe it would be good to use if you were just having a photo shoot but otherwise not so much</li>
    <li> arrived very quickly and product actually works as promised.  I was skeptical and was happy to be proven wrong.</li>
    <li> great product, really works</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the assumption that it was vials, when I received it, to my surprise it was sachets. Although the products works well you are not getting what you paid for.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Product as described.</li>
    <li> Love this product used it on my mom WOW will definitely order again</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me. It really reduced the bags under my eyes. The only down side is that it&#x27;s temporary. I think some of the complaints are from people who used it incorrectly or who don&#x27;t really need this product. My needs are obvious. Younger people who look good but are trying for perfection probably won&#x27;t get the effect they want. I found a video showing application tips that I found helpful. This product comes out of the tube in kind of light brownish color. I&#x27;m not sure what results you get if you apply it in this form. *The trick is to put it on one finger and gently rub it with another finger until the product turns clear before applying to your face. Once applied don&#x27;t move your face and blow cool air over the area for a couple of minutes. A small fan or a hair dryer on cool setting works well. You can feel your skin tighten.</li>
    <li> YES I RECEIVED THE VIALS as I do not LIKE THE SACHETS!  Very quick service and I love the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but this price in INSANE!!! You get a full box for 74.95 plus shipping through an actual Jeunesse web page. If you don&#x27;t want to get ripped off, go to www .sweetfreshness.jeunesseglobal .com</li>
    <li> It really helps to soften wrinkles! I love it!!</li>
    <li> This product only last about five minutes. Just long enough to let it dry, see the results, then get a picture  and as soon as you smile it goes right back to how it was before using anything. I&#x27;m very disappointed! At least thirty minutes would have been better than what it does.</li>
    <li> I am always VERY skeptical of beauty products promises.  I don&#x27;t believe before and after pics because I know photography and how it works.&lt;br /&gt;BUT this product does EXACTLY what it claims to do!  My friends and I are ecstatic!!!  My bags are gone, gone gone.  Granted its only a temporary fix but this stuff is so darn affordable I can use it everyday.  1 ampule is easily 5 applications.  Don&#x27;t take my word for it...I wouldn&#x27;t...LOL.&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT AND BE A BELIEVER.</li>
    <li> ok but not enough product to really see a difference</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I was VERY disappointed with the product and the money wasted on it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how those utube videos are made, but I saw absolutely no difference using this product.  All it does is form a thin crust under my eyes, but no lift whatsoever!</li>
    <li> Dark skin the white is noticeable</li>
    <li> Worked like it said it would but ... very noticeable ... You could really see the patch (cream) on your face :) .</li>
    <li> Item delivered really fast.  I searched specifically to buy vials and what I received were small packets.  Not what I ordered.  Each packet has enough product to apply twice under each eye so two days worth of product per packet.  I was surprised for the results.  I have to say that I noticed a great improvement on the look of my eyes. Even when the effect is temporary I do recommend the product.  It is worth your money.</li>
    <li> It left a white powdery substance on my face with no change in my light wrinkles.  If I wiped it off, the dried cream was gone and there was no difference.  Will keep experimenting or find something else.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. There is some improvement but not as dramatic as the video showed on Facebook in my opinion</li>
    <li> Just Okay-does reduce puffiness but-can&#x27;t use with makeup and appears to flake after a few hours.</li>
    <li> Feels like I put raw egg white on my face.  Effects immediately leave once you wash your face.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but this product really does work! It is not feasible to use everyday, as it could be very expensive, but for those days when your eyes are really puffy or if you want to look your best for an event, it works really well! I will definitely reorder this product!</li>
    <li> The product worked ok, after washing my face and drying I applied under both eyes to minimize the under eye bag appearance. The under eye bag disappear on my left eye almost instantaneously, but on my right eye the appearance of the under eye bag was still visible, but a lot less than usual. the effect only lasted a bit longer than two hours I will try again tomorrow with more time hoping for better results.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick but received sachets instead of vials :/ Was not very impressed with the product. Seemed to tighten but then ended up having a powdery appearance about 15 minutes later. Glad I went with a trial order.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference. Did not work very well</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it said it would do.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t get viles ....you get little packet God for one use</li>
    <li> save your money this is a wast</li>
    <li> doesn&amp;#34;t work as well as advertized</li>
    <li> No it dont work And leaves your eyes crusty feeling.. big gimmick</li>
    <li> I searched specifically to buy vials and did receive the small packets and there&#x27;s only enough in each one to barely do anything with.  I did notice about a 25% improvement in the eye bags...but that&#x27;s about it.  I was expecting results like I&#x27;ve seen in the video.  That would be nice if that were true!  Also, it does leave a white film on the eyes, but fortunately I have a very light skin tone so that wasn&#x27;t so bad.  Also it feels like you have cried and the tears dried on your face.  I could also live with that if only the product worked like it says.  Finally, it did nothing for the fine lines around my eyes and if anything it made them bigger wrinkles with the product on them.  If anyone comes up with something that actually works like the video for the product shows it does, let me know!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing the videos and being blown away by the transformation. So upon getting mine and trying it out I was pretty amazed.  Problem is that the effects do not last more than a couple of hours.  That was VERY disappointing. From what they say it is supposed to last in the 6 hour range and that definitely did not happen with me. So until they get it approved by the FDA and get it to last longer than a movie I&#x27;m going to take a pass on this product. It was a money waster.</li>
    <li> Works ok....doesn&#x27;t last long as I would like.</li>
    <li> Love these little vials</li>
    <li> I love the product but not the shipping cost</li>
    <li> It was ok, but some of the instantly ageless TM seem to be dried up.  It was hard for me to get the product out.</li>
    <li> Incredible product!  I would not have believed it if I didn&#x27;t try it myself!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bunk product ... Glad I just bought a sample.</li>
    <li> Total scam  didnt work at all</li>
    <li> Had a little problem getting what I ordered but the product is fab!</li>
    <li> This is the biggest rip off I have ever tried.. It made my skin feel drawn a bit but look wise not a bit of difference.. I could as well have had poligrip under my eyes for all the good it did.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations!</li>
    <li> It works, just have to be careful not to use too much.  More is not better in this case.</li>
    <li> WOW!  Its amazing.  I look several years younger.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF ACTUALLY WORKS , I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF MIXED REVIEWS ON THIS BUT I DO NOT SELL THIS OR AM BEING PAID TO SAY THIS.... YOU HAVE TO PUT LIKE A SMALL AMOUNT ON AND PAT IT TO YOUR EYES , LEAVE IT A LITTLE DAMP AND YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE. I WAS EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THIS CONSIDERING ALL THE REVIEWS BUT I AM BLOWN AWAY BY THE DIFFERENCE IT MAKES.... MY GIRLFRIEND IS ALWAYS COMPLIMENTING ON HOW MY EYES LOOK WHEN I USE IT</li>
    <li> It really works good if you know how use the right amount. I tried many times to get it right.</li>
    <li> Good, it really works. My mother liked!!</li>
    <li> What I received was not Vials they were sachets. Not happy!!!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  IT WORKS. Not so much on my under eyes but amazing round my mouth.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Only problem I had was with the shipping charge...how can a simple envelope delivered by regular mail cost almost $5..I think that was an outrageous rip off...that being said...the product itself really does the job it promises.  My first application at 4:30pm actually lasted until midnight so I was very happy with the results, brought it to work and did a &amp;#34;show and tell&amp;#34; demo for my coworkers..everyone was amazed!</li>
    <li> Never worked like the video. Maybe product was to old?</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  Although it did immediately reduce the circles under my eyes, the circles just as immediately came back when I added makeup.  Pretty much a waste of money.</li>
    <li> very temporary results.  Less than 3 hours for me.</li>
    <li> Really! Works great! ! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe it when I tried it until I saw it with my own eyes it works for about 6 hours.</li>
    <li> I ordered Vials but got sachet&#x27;s. I have used it once and will try again. Saw some change, not sure it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> Does not work; Leaves visible residue on your face</li>
    <li> It works like in the video but leaves a color and some kind of texture hard to cover with make up. A little disappointed</li>
    <li> The formula has changed and does not work as well. It was supposed to be a serum in vials, but instead came as a cream in sachet packets.</li>
    <li> Packaging was different then the picture. Product came in sample like packs, not vials . Seller did tape a note to the product stating that this is the new packaging from the company. As for the product it works, but is quite uncomfortable on the skin. I would not wear this everyday. If you move it cracks, so i wouldn&#x27;t recommend for frown lines.. works best for under eye bags!!! I also found that if the product turns chalky to add a tiny bit of water with it before applying..</li>
    <li> Second time getting this product. Love it!</li>
