      <li>Will be ordering more in the future</li>
      <li>I have used many of the different Fixodent products.</li>

      <li>Of all the products that I have tried, this particular choice seems to work better for me than products from both Fixodent and other brands.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite \\&quot;Fixodent\\&quot; cream but over the last couple of years, none of our local stores carry it anymore.</li>
      <li>She is very satisfied with the price of it and the way it holds her dentures in, she has no slippage and food particles getting under her teeth and we have a hard time finding the fixodent comfort around where we live.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it is not easy to purchase any more.  </li>
      <li>I find it keeps my teeth secure longer than any other.</li>
      <li>I will not use anything except FIXODENT COMFORT NATURE&#x27;S INSPIRATION ASHESIVE CREAM NATURAL CHAMOMILE FLAVOR.</li>
      <li>Fixodent Comfort Nature&#x27;s Inspiration with natural chamomile flavor Denture Adhesive Cream, 2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)]]      </li>

    <li> I love this product.  I have a hard time finding it at any of our local stores, so I always have to order it on line.  While I have used other Fixodent  products. I find that Nature&#x27;s Inspiration works better than the other adhesive creams.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003CP12P2 Fixodent Comfort Nature&#x27;s Inspiration with natural chamomile flavor Denture Adhesive Cream, 2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)]]      my brother loves this.</li>
    <li> This is one of the greats product I have ever had the pleasure of using....</li>
    <li> I am so sad that they have taken this off the market it is the only thing that works for me. I should have given it 5 stars.  I hope they reformulate it and place it back on the market.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find anything better!</li>
    <li> It is so hard to find! Can&#x27;t figure out why Proctor n Gamble wont increase production.. Also got a really poor response from Proctor n Gamble!!  they are the manufacturer!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used many of the different Fixodent products. This one is the best ever. I find it keeps my teeth secure longer than any other. I will not use anything except FIXODENT COMFORT NATURE&#x27;S INSPIRATION ASHESIVE CREAM NATURAL CHAMOMILE FLAVOR. When the store stopped stocking it I turned to the internet. Now I order from the internet all the time. I will probably continue to buy online even if the store starts carrying it again.....</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband who has a plastic based upper denture. He said it works well but I do not like the fact that it leaves a heavy residue in the drain when he cleans the product off the denture. Yuck!</li>
    <li> Fixodent Comfort is not knowen to many people. It really gives comfort whole day.it is good for who cannot comfortable with their dentures.Let me tell you ,I tried all pharmacy stores at out states,but I found only at AMAZON.</li>
    <li> My wife likes this better than regular fixodent. She is very satisfied with the price of it and the way it holds her dentures in, she has no slippage and food particles getting under her teeth and we have a hard time finding the fixodent comfort around where we live. So, we are very satisfied and will buy more from this vendor.</li>
    <li> Who wears dentures need confidence in fixing your dentures and Fixodent Comfort Nature&#x27;s gives me this confidence. I use and recommend.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this adhesive cream, the flavor comes through with every bite of food I eat, and It just doesn&#x27;t hold well at all.</li>
    <li> Generally if an advertisment says a product is comfortable it is open to a wide interpretation.  However, with this one comfort is the word.  It works well on those tender places on your gums.  It holds relatively well; I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s excellent but the fault lies with the fit of my denture more than with the cream.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like any of the others, tried them all. This one&lt;br /&gt;works and it&#x27;s not irritating. Please don&#x27;t discontinue!</li>
    <li> fixodent has always made the best denture adhesive on the market. Comfort is just what it says, a comfortable way to secure your dentures. If you have sore spots or tender places this is the one for you</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Will use again.</li>
    <li> i was very very uncomfortable with my partials and could not find a solution with any other products, including other fixodent products; finally, I can wear my partials with comfort and control.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Of all the products that I have tried, this particular choice seems to work better for me than products from both Fixodent and other brands.  Unfortunately, it is not easy to purchase any more.  Why does this company keep changing what is available for purchase???</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have a hard time finding it in stores where I live!  But this way made it easy!</li>
    <li> fast shippment just what we needed this is 2nd time around they are very reliable etcetc etc etcetc etc etc</li>
    <li> I purchase this product a lot love it</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001FWXSAG Fixodent Denture Adhesive Cream Plus Scope, Adhesive With Control Tip, 2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)]]&lt;br /&gt;This is the very best product of the Fixodent line. ou can be assurred your teeth won&#x27;t fall out T A DINNER PARTY.</li>

    <li> I had a hard time finding this product. It really works for any irritation to the gums and holds strong.</li>
    <li> My mom can never find this product in CVS, Walgreens or even Walmart.  It was great to find it on-line and especially in a multi-pack to save time and money.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite \\&quot;Fixodent\\&quot; cream but over the last couple of years, none of our local stores carry it anymore. I&#x27;ve been getting it on \\&quot;Subscirbe &amp; Save\\&quot; from Amazon several times but it seems, this option has now been discontinued. I will still try to find it from different sellers as this adhesive cream is very smooth, odorless and colorless. I don&#x27;t care much for the pink ones as they have tendency to be on the \\&quot;too\\&quot; sticky side. This one is perfect anyone who wants to feel comfortable all day and just forget about their dentures!</li>
    <li> As I said having a hard time finding this product around my area. Use it daily, I recommend this product for anyone that has a hard time with their dentures.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and was delivered on time as specified, what more can be said.  I&#x27;m Happy!!</li>
    <li> I prefer this product over others, but it has become difficult to find locally.  Amazon was able to link us up with a provider.  Kudos to both.  The price, quality and timely delivery was spot on.</li>
    <li> WhAT! No longer found on my drug store shelves in town. This is the only product that adjusted my dentures well enough for me to wear AND eat with them. I love this product. So glad to have found the best quantity at the best price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like this product, as it hold my dentures better than any other that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I used to be able to get it at Walmart but they quit carrying it. So I buy it on line</li>
    <li> I have tryed about every thing put out on the market to keep food from getting under my dentures.  I pray that they DO NOT STOP MAKING THIS ONE.This is the best &amp; holds all day long...</li>
