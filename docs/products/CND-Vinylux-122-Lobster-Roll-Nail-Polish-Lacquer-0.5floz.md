      <li>favorite color in this line)</li>
      <li>Colour like lobster :)</li>
      <li>Love this color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be great for your nails too, especially if you are better are polishing them than I am!</li>
      <li>I mainly use it for doing my own pedicures and try to go to the salon for my manicures (just because I&#x27;m not that accurate at doing my own nails).</li>
      <li>Dries very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Stays on forever, and comes off easily with polish remover.  </li>
      <li>Easy to put on and easy to take off.</li>
      <li>Lasts a full week with 2 coats and 2 top coats!&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
      <li>Super!</li>
      <li>It does have a strong smell but it is worth it!</li>
      <li>,  I enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>Unique color.</li>
      <li>Had my manicurist apply the polish and all the girls there were excited about it.</li>
      <li>I  love this polish, stays on much longer and looks great enough for compliments</li>
      <li>best, very few cracks</li>
      <li>Very close to Cajun Shrimp, which is my absolute favorite of all!  </li>
      <li>I love Vinylux, and it really does last longer than most polishes.</li>
      <li>Color is pretty.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Using it with the top coat didn&#x27;t produce a manicure that lasted any longer than regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>This is my first time to try vinyl polish</li>
      <li>The only problem is that nails aren&#x27;t quite as strong with the lighter Vinylux.  </li>
      <li>I interchange both, depending on how much time I have.</li>
      <li>Stays on for the whole week, even when I had a week of holiday cooking and was doing dishes and preparing food.  </li>
      <li>This color is more pink than it shows up on my monitor.  </li>
      <li>Drys fast and lasts real well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a pink than shown here....</li>
      <li>Great wearability with such little effort!</li>
      <li>My new fave color.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The color is a lot pinker than the picture, which has a more orangey look.  : /.</li>
      <li>Goes on and is removed like any other nail polish but lasts a full two weeks  without chipping.</li>
      <li>The nailpolish itself is ok but the color is not good for me.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a red orange color as the picture shows, but i got a hot pink color.</li>
      <li>not dry out nails.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>

    <li> I  love this polish, stays on much longer and looks great enough for compliments</li>
    <li> Color is pretty. It last at least a week. It does have a strong smell but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product.  Using it with the top coat didn&#x27;t produce a manicure that lasted any longer than regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> My new fave color.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The nailpolish itself is ok but the color is not good for me.  Would maybe try brand again though.  Hope another color would work out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more of a pink than shown here....not exactly hot red like I was hoping for.  Still a great color, just not what I was in search of.</li>

    <li> Love this polish!  Stays on forever, and comes off easily with polish remover.  Plan to buy in lots of colors!</li>
    <li> This is my first time to try vinyl polish and I do love this polish. The color is great!  Very close to Cajun Shrimp, which is my absolute favorite of all!  I purchased 2 colors and I am happy with both. I will not purchase what I call &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; polish again.  I mainly use it for doing my own pedicures and try to go to the salon for my manicures (just because I&#x27;m not that accurate at doing my own nails). I&#x27;m sure it would be great for your nails too, especially if you are better are polishing them than I am! The color lasts for 2-3 weeks and does not chip. It does work best if you use a top coat. After placing my order, it took about 1 week to arrive.  I am very pleased with this seller and would purchase from them again. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Keeps shine like glass.&lt;br /&gt;Resists chipping up to 6-7 days or longer if you are just hanging out at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;Comes off with acetone.&lt;br /&gt;Does not dry out nails.&lt;br /&gt;Great alternative to Shellac</li>
    <li> Super! Thanks! The colour pinker, not that red as on a picture! Colour like lobster :)</li>
    <li> Unique color. But it didn&#x27;t last me as long as the other CND polishes I use, not sure if it&#x27;s the color though.</li>
    <li> Good product!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite color in this line)</li>
    <li> Flourecent like color that is bright and looks like photo.  Not quite as orange as I imagined but looks like description and arrived in perfect condition, fast and as described.</li>
    <li> This polish last for 2 wks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best, very few cracks,  I enjoy this product. The color doesn&#x27;t fade over time.</li>
    <li> This color is more pink than it shows up on my monitor.  Nice color but I was looking forward to something a little brighter</li>
    <li> Vinylux is so much less time-consuming than Shellac nail polish.  Love this color.  Dries very quickly.  The only problem is that nails aren&#x27;t quite as strong with the lighter Vinylux.  I interchange both, depending on how much time I have.</li>
    <li> Does what is meant to do! Apply it myself w/ the Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
    <li> great Nail polish! Love the color and durablity! Lasts a full week with 2 coats and 2 top coats!&lt;br /&gt;Need 100% acatone to easily remove!</li>
    <li> love this product - a manicure lasts all week and the color stays bright.  I would purchase this again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing nail polish. Goes on and is removed like any other nail polish but lasts a full two weeks  without chipping.</li>
    <li> color doesn&#x27;t mach!!!</li>
    <li> Amaziing polish. Stays on for the whole week, even when I had a week of holiday cooking and was doing dishes and preparing food.  Had my manicurist apply the polish and all the girls there were excited about it. Easy to put on and easy to take off.</li>
    <li> Lasted over two weeks.  The only reason I needed to change my polish was because of growth.  Almost as good as gel polish without having your hands go under the dryer.  Been using for over six months.  Want to get many more colors.</li>
    <li> Color isn&#x27;t as bright as pictured. A little disappointed in the color.</li>
    <li> Great wearability with such little effort! This color is perfect for every day because it just goes well with everything. It&#x27;s not a bright true red, so it works well with oranges as well as with reds. It&#x27;s my go to color.</li>
    <li> I wanted a red orange color as the picture shows, but i got a hot pink color. CND Vinylux #122 Lobster Roll Nail Polish color, is not as shown.</li>
    <li> Not that great. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should.</li>
