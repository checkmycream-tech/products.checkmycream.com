      <li>Love to spray this on after the shower</li>
      <li>It really helps detangle and is a great leave-in-treatment.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I thought I better give it a try.</li>
      <li>Soon as I use it , my hair is revitalized and so soft , so glad my good hair dresser got me hooked on this !</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 5 year old with super curly hair (using in combination with the Knot Genie brush) after a summer of swimming had damaged her beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it will soon be available any longer.</li>
      <li>Works great especially after washing and conditioning my hair with Matrix shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Product didn&#x27;t seem right after thawing and I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This product is worth its weight in gold!</li>
      <li>great conditioning spray.. keeps my hair conditioned really well.. and not heavy....</li>

      <li>It saved me so much money to buy from this distributor.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to reduce frizz &amp; produce shine.</li>
      <li>Its brand new</li>

      <li>keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Oh....I do frost my hair, so that may make a difference as opposed to someone that has their natural hair color.</li>

    <li> Love it! Seems to be improving my hair condition. Great fragrance.</li>
    <li> great conditioning spray.. keeps my hair conditioned really well.. and not heavy.... in the summer my hair gets rather dry and this helps keep it conditioned..</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 10 years. Never found anything that comes close to it.&lt;br /&gt;You will love your hair again.</li>
    <li> My salon stylist sold this to me on my last visit. Although its a little less expensive through Amazon, it&#x27;s still way overpriced in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 5 year old with super curly hair (using in combination with the Knot Genie brush) after a summer of swimming had damaged her beautiful hair. Her hair is much softer now, this really helps comb out the tangles, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, so it isn&#x27;t increaing the washing frequency.</li>
    <li> Works great especially after washing and conditioning my hair with Matrix shampoo and conditioner. So far the best leave in conditioner I have come across.</li>
    <li> The product I received is completely different from the product I ordered!  I ordered &amp;#34;Total Results Pro Solutionist Instacure Leave-in Treatment Spray&amp;#34;, that was described as being a conditioning SPRAY for after shampoo.  What I got was &amp;#34;Total Results ProSolutionist 5 + Protopak Restructuring Treatment&amp;#34;, which is a PUMP that you have to use heat treatment for 15-20 minutes and then rinse out!  The item I ordered was also oozing the contents, and had been opened!  I have never had any problems with Amazon before, and hate to file a complaint, but am disappointed!</li>
    <li> It was frozen - wrong time of year to order. Product didn&#x27;t seem right after thawing and I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been use this conditioner for over three years now. and still like it!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It  is a great repair product for hair.  Especially if you use blow dryers, curling or straightening irons or coloring products.  It saved me so much money to buy from this distributor. Its brand new and I received it quicker.than expected.  Win  win</li>
    <li> Used for years good product.</li>
    <li> This product is worth its weight in gold! I double process my hair and using this daily keeps my hair soft and shiny.It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it oily or limp. Buying here is like half the price of a salon also.</li>
    <li> Works great! So much better than drugstore brands!</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel incredibly thick and healthy. It looks shinier too. I was recommended this product by my stylist. I wish I could find it in local stores, but I am willing to pay for shipping to get this product again.</li>
    <li> great product and distributor</li>
    <li> After my beautician used this on me I thought I better give it a try. It does help my fine/thin hair not be so fly away and I don&#x27;t have the tangles and knots. Smells okay and you don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this product for very long but in the short time that I have it&#x27;s been working well. My hair is looking healthier and smoother.</li>
    <li> So happy with this product been using it for a few years to keep my over processed hair from falling out ! This is what I believe keeps my hair in one piece after all the stuff I do to it , and helps it grow ! Love to spray this on after the shower and I notice the difference when I don&#x27;t use it , my hair is dry and sad and hard !  Soon as I use it , my hair is revitalized and so soft , so glad my good hair dresser got me hooked on this ! Works great for heat protection , sun protection , and as a hair refresher ! Love the way it makes a blow out look , smells okay too ! I use it daily and one bottle last me about 2 months or more , a little goes a long way , but I&#x27;m excessive ! Always on the search for amazing hair products for overly porous bleached out hair ! This is hair rescue therapy In a bottle !</li>
    <li> I have thin hair. And this conditioner is just right.  It gives me shine and untangles my hair.  Came as advertised.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to reduce frizz &amp; produce shine. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Makes the scalp feel loved.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years after my hairdresser started using it in his shop.  I love it.  It works for me because I have dry, frizzy type hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair seem to have its own mind sometimes and flies away this keeps it under control and super soft.&lt;br /&gt;I sm disappointed with the packaging, as the sprayer will not work so I will be forced to purchase a bottle from my local drug store to spray it :(</li>
    <li> I have been buying this stuff for years now. I have wavy, curly, frizzy, tangled hair and this works great right after a shower to help me comb it out. I out it on and let it sit for 5-10 minutes then brush through my hair. It really helps detangle and is a great leave-in-treatment. It is hard to find this exact product in stores so I am glad it&#x27;s on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This made my hair a little softer on the first day of use. I don&#x27;t think it will soon be available any longer. And that won&#x27;t bother me one bit. I am sure there are other products out there that would work much better. Will keep searching. Oh....I do frost my hair, so that may make a difference as opposed to someone that has their natural hair color. But really, how many of us still have the same hair we were born with?</li>
