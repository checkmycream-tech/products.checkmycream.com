<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product works great. Has a slight odor. Shipped quickly. Would purchase again. Only thing is, it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> We have hard water and my hair always turns orange and I highlight my hair. Every time I use Malibu C it looks like I just had my hair done.</li>
    <li> Helped with getting buildup out of my hair leaving it feeling silky and smooth. Didn&#x27;t help change the ugly brassy tone of my hair.</li>
    <li> After I use this each week, my hair feels softer and lighter weight from the removal of the hard water minerals in my hair.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> My hair looked dirty all of the time from our hard water. I tried other products. I tried vinegar. This is the only thing that works. I only need to use it a couple of times a month.</li>
    <li> We recently moved to new location and the water here is very hard. My hair started to be brittle, brassy and was breaking off in all different lengths.  It took myself &amp; hairdresser to figure what was going on with my hair.  So I ordered this product. OMGoodness it worked.  Hair has been restored to softness.  I also use the Maibu Conditioner. The fragrance of the conditioner is very nice.  I wished Maibu had a chemical enhanced shampoo.  If anyone knows this product line has a chemical enhanced shampoo, please email me.</li>
    <li> I have hard water with lots of minerals that makes your hair feel like straw.  In the past, I have had water systems that worked well, but I currently don&#x27;t have one installed.  I tried these products to help take the minerals out of my hair.  However, the products made my hair dried, brittle, and it made it worse.</li>
    <li> This product along with the Malibu Swimmers shampoo and conditioner are the best I&#x27;ve tried for chlorine neutralization.  Normally when I colour my hair, due to the lovely chlorine, it turns a different colour at my scalp (on the virgin hair) than at the ends that is already coloured.  Not so pretty.  Using this right before I colour has finally resulted in even colour root to tip.  Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have well water, and our water softner was broken for a very long time. My hair was neon orange from all the rust in our water--it was so gross. I am a natural blond, so it was really hard to keep it looking good. I was so tempted to dye my hair dark just so I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with it, but then I found out I was pregnant and I REALLY didn&#x27;t want dark hair with blond roots...Anyway, after our softner was fixed, I used several of these packets within a couple weeks time on my hair and my hair instantly went back to my bright, shiny blond! I was so excited! Before, I had to wash my hair everyday because the minerals kept my hair greasy looking, tangled, and hard to manage. I actually broke a brush trying to brush my hair after I already styled it! Now it is softer, and holds its style much better! I even purchased this for my sister who also has well water, and she has become a fan. She highlights her hair and was wasting tons of money getting highlights to fix the orange. Since I purchased this for her, she has become an avid fan. Here are some tips that help me:    1. Right after I wash my hair, I put it in and cover it with a plastic shower cap. This allows the heat from the shower to process the treatment while I finsih shaving, etc.  2. I don&#x27;t rinse it out when I&#x27;m finished with my shower because I then take a blow dryer and heat the shower cap for 10 mins.     It works a lot better if you apply some sort of heat. The directions reccommend this, but I did it because when I went to the salon to get the treatment, they use heat.</li>
    <li> I could not understand why my blond highlights were turning orange and even pink.  I thought it might be a face cream or something.  Then I read an article on how well water can cause that to happen.  Malibu products were recommended by people who were not affiliated with the company.  I am delighted to say that the \\&quot;once-a-week\\&quot; treatment works really well.  The shampoo and conditioner are okay, but not enough.</li>
    <li> get my hair blonde again</li>
    <li> Works great on hard water, I use between appointments.</li>
    <li> Yes, it worked&amp;#34;. We are on well water and with the hair coloring, my hair was yellow in the back for the minerals.  -free using the shampoo daily and the treatment weekly, my hair is back to normal.  Definitely will recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product to use weekly if you live where the water is hard and you are on a well.  It does an amazing job of removing the residue left by hard water.  This is especially noticeable on gray hair.</li>
    <li> My hair would not hold a curl. Now, I barely hold my hair in a curling iron for 10 seconds and I have ringlets. It is truly amazing. I recommend it for anyone that has well water, even if your water tastes really good like mine, but it is still hard water. You&#x27;ll be amazed too!</li>
    <li> excellent for washing impurities from your hair. It adds brightness and body to your hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just going to restate what everyone else has been saying - terrible, hard, well water &#x3D; terrible, frizzy, dry unmanageable flat hair.  Malibu Demineralizer &#x3D; soft, shiny, frizz-free hair that actually curls and bounces again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 9 agonizing years of awful hair, with a cupboard full of every \\&quot;frizz-free\\&quot; product on the market (that never worked) - over-the-counter as well as salon products, I finally found Malibu.  Thank you, Thank you!!  I am sooo thankful to finally have found something that gives me back, healthy hair.  I had given up and cut it short because I couldn&#x27;t take the frizz around my neck anymore.  I blamed grey-hair, coloring and a thyroid condition as the reasons for my crazy hair, but my young daughters have been having the same trouble as they grow and their hair gets longer.  I&#x27;m also using the shampoo and conditioner, but I believe the Demineralizer is the key.  LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> My family is about five weeks from moving to a new home.  That home has a water softener, our current home does not, and although our city usually softens, when we get into drought conditions, they stop.  Our water has never been as hard as it is now, and my daughter and I are noticing that our hair is weighed down, difficult to work with, and for lack of a better term, seems to become a big &#x27;clump&#x27; when we try to wash it.  Since it&#x27;s silly to spend the money on a water softener a month before moving, I decided to try this treatment, and am thrilled that I did.  I notice some reviews say it has a pleasant fragrance- that was not our experience, but I almost wonder if it&#x27;s because our hair had so much hard water residue on it that it was reacting to the chemicals. The odor that came off our hair when the treatment was on was not pleasant at all, and after rinsing I felt the need to use my own conditioner afterwards.  But the positive point is:  our hair was changed for the better, instantly!  I only used it for the first time yesterday, so I don&#x27;t know if we will get a full week out of it, but for now I just had to review it to say that it does everything it claims- so happy to have hair that moves again!</li>
    <li> This product either is not compatible with my hair, or simply doesn&#x27;t work as described. I have seriously crummy well water. This product only made my hair more coarse and difficult to manage. I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;However, the transaction was flawless. The price was right, and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I live in Los Angeles and have hard water in our apartment. I was blonde when I was little and now get treated with combo of bleach and color , am also covering grays more and more. My color easily goes brassy (not good) and the texture has been getting frizzy.  For the past year Have been using this once a week and it makes my hair feel amazing (!!) for a few days, and I Think it helps keep the brass under control. It&#x27;s a definite must for me now. l LOVE THIS PRODUCT and found on amazon through reviews etc... Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week and it keeps my highlighted blonde hair blonde and not green (from bad water running through copper pipes). I NEED this stuff!</li>
    <li> A must have if you have hard water. My hair stylist recommended these every time I came in there b/c the rust build up on my hair was ridiculous and changed the color so much.  It is easy to use and really does the job without damaging your hair.  My highlights stay true to color and I do not have the orange build up.</li>
    <li> This product deserves every one of its five stars. Used after shampoo, this product makes my hair look and feel much cleaner. I can actually run my fingers through my hair without catching any snags or residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford a water softener, that&#x27;s still your best bet, because this product does add a little extra hassle to your shower routine. You have to leave it on your hair for at least several minutes. But if you&#x27;re buying this I would assume that a water softener is out of the question, and in that case, this product is all but a lifesaver.</li>
    <li> This product is so well worth the money! I tried it after moving back home for awhile, and forgot what well water does to your hair, my hair was turning orange, and was so dry, couldnt do anything with it! So i bought these to see what would help, and this is the best thing ever!!!! I wish i would of had this when i grew up with the well water..you wont be disappointed at all!!</li>
    <li> Works to get rid of the brassines left by our hard water and high iron content however I still need a beauty shop clarifying treatment at least q6 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t completely solve my issue with my blonde hair turning brassy, but it sure did help! After using this in the process of going baby-platinum, I can say it does help keep not only the odd tones out of your hair, but works almost like a clarifier for those with hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to maximize the results for blonde hair, I follow the instructions on the box, but place a deep moisturizing mask on after. I then rinse with cool water, shampoo with a good violet shampoo, and condition mid-shaft to ends again. This helps push the lightness/coolness in color I get from the Malibu to an even better result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this makes my hair a little porous, so be careful how long you leave on the purple shampoo unless you don&#x27;t mind a hint of lilac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not necessarily advise this for platinum though. This product is not advised for those with grey or silver hair. Perhaps it&#x27;s for the same reason? As my hair got lighter, the color I got directly after the Malibu looked more and more yellow and was harder to combat (I&#x27;d take the purple shampoo to it and end up with purple and yellow). If you&#x27;re at that almost colorless level of platinum, approach this carefully. They do have a product for blondes, which is what I&#x27;ll try next, as I&#x27;m now too light for this one. I don&#x27;t see that as a product flaw ultimately, as I was quite pleased until toward the end of my color transformation.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> works awesome.  use once a week, just to keep the rust out of my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been a source of pride but for the past three months, I have been ashamed of my hair and I honestly was attributing its bad condition to a natural part of aging (I am almost 42). After moving into my new house, my hair went from shiny and naturally curly to frizzy and weirdly straight in spots. My hairdresser convinced me to get a water softener for the house and that I would see the difference in my hair. I have seen minimal difference and have continued to be disheartened by my hair. So I started doing research and finally ordered this product after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I used my first packet - now I cant say it is miraculous, but I am hopeful. It is definitely fuller. I see shine again. It feels better. I still have some frizzy spots...and the curl is not back, but I am less freaked out by what it looks like. And right now, that is what I will settle for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the packet pretty closely, I shampooed, then I lathered the packet in. I wrapped my hair with a towel for about 20 minutes and then I rinsed and conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will do it again next week and am hoping for continued improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product; after one use, I feel like I can go out in public without putting my hair in a ponytail! that is a big deal!</li>
    <li> First let me say that I have never wanted to be a \\&quot;high maintenance hair\\&quot; kind of girl.  When I get a hair cut, the most important instruction I give the stylist is that I want a style that I can just wash, dry, brush and go...if it takes more than 5 minutes to do my hair in the morning, something is seriously wrong! For this reason, I have also never been big on spending a lot of money on hair care products or accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a house with typical Florida well water and because I rent, I have limited options for changing the current water filtration/treatment system.  For months I had noticed my hair becoming more and more damaged and unmanageable but didn&#x27;t know why. I tried several expensive shampoos, conditioners, and other \\&quot;repair\\&quot; products, but noticed very little results.  My hair is extremely fine and has always tangled easily, but now it was also very dry and brittle.  When I would brush it, I was alarmed at the amount of hair left in the brush because it would split and break. I went searching online to try to find what might be causing so much damage and learned that the well water was probably the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All over the internet, Malibu products seemed to have the best ratings.  When I found this ad and read the reviews, I was a bit skeptical, but the price was good so I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a shot.  I just received my order today and tried it for the first time....it is amazing! This is the first time in months that I have been able to run a brush through my hair without hitting any snags or causing splits and breaks.  I am definitely a fan and will continue to buy Malibu products for my hair!</li>
    <li> With my husband&#x27;s job, we end up all sorts of places. We&#x27;ve been in a location with extremely hard water, and it&#x27;s been hard on the whole family&#x27;s skin as well as my (and my husband&#x27;s) hair. I went from hair in lovely condition to an itchy scalp, overdry, brittle hair, and just a horrible frizzy, unhealthy look. My best guess was the water, just knowing how hard it was and how it had been affecting our skin. So spent awhile looking for suggestions online for dealing with hard water and how it affects hair. When I found this, I figured it was worth a try. After all, I was at a point of where it was unlikely to get much worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair and scalp immediately improved after one treatment with this. I followed the instructions for applying it, then wrapped my head in a towel and let it sit for about 30 minutes. (If I had any plastic shower caps, I&#x27;d probably use them instead, but a towel works in a pinch!) Until a water softener was installed, I used these once a week to help my hair. They make it soft, shiny, and healthy looking again! And no more itchy scalp, either. Bliss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the water softener has been installed, I generally don&#x27;t need to use these unless we have a bit of time where the water gets hard again. (Which generally means it&#x27;s time for the softener to be maintained!) So I keep some around just in case, now. But it&#x27;s definitely a fabulous product and works quite well! Whatever the reason for your hard water, give it a try if your hair isn&#x27;t in as good of a condition as you would like.</li>
    <li> Works great removing iron buildup</li>
    <li> Didnt really know about this product. I have tried  Malibu shampoo before but never this. Love love it and great seller was very fast and product was what was advertised.</li>
    <li> Tried this hard water treatment in conjunction with the Malibu Scalp Wellness shampoo and conditioner.  We have real hard water where I live in Germany, and my scalp used to itch all the time.  Used this demineralizer before washing my hair and using the conditioner.  Great looking hair, and no itch.</li>
    <li> At last something that takes the harsh brass color out of my hair! I wish I would have found it years ago!!</li>
    <li> I have well water with lots of iron in it. My hair got dry and frizzy in the hot and humid summers here in Florida, and had a red tint to it. I knew I had to do something.     After speaking with my hairdresser, I did some research online and discovered the Malibu products.     The 2000 Hard Water Weekly Demineralizer makes my hair shiny, soft and reduces the redness. I use it at least twice a month. It is worth every penny!    I highly recommend it along with the Malibu Well Water Shampoo and Contioner. You will see a difference!</li>
    <li> After years of being plagued by well water build up I finally found a product which consistently does exactly what it promises to do...transforms my hair into it&#x27;s healthy and natural state.  I have tried all other remedies...from clarifying shampoos to home spun treatments and no other treatment works as well as this.  I recommend using heat and leaving it on for 20 minutes for the first time to get rid of heavy build-up...and less for subsequent treatments.  I find that it is optimal to use this at least once a week (or two) to minimize buildup.  I have also used the Malibu shampoo and conditioner.  It works okay but tends to leave my hair feeling a bit dry.  Anyway...great product...HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders! I&#x27;m a natural blonde. Before I found this product, I tried everything you could think of to get the orange out of my hair. I even dyed it brown with red highlights to hide the orange highlights I had from my water. That however lasted a week before the orange came back. I found this product and I use it once a week for 20 minutes while I blow-dry my hair on low. Of course the orange color comes back, but that&#x27;s because I wash my hair twice a day in well water. But for the few days after I feel confident to wear my hair down again.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  I will definitely continue to buy it!  It has completely taken the brassiness out of my hair.  I have seriously crazy thick hair, and therefore I have to use two packets at once, but it does the job!</li>
    <li> This is SERIOUSLY the holy grail for anyone using well water. I have a tremendous amount of iron in my water and it all adheres to my blonde hair creating an unsightly orange tinge. I am obsessed with having good color--I will NOT tolerate brassiness in my blonde hair. It&#x27;s just not negotiable. This product saved my hair from the well water and removed every last trace of mineral build up. My hair went back to its beautiful buttery blonde color, softness, manageability, and bounce. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this stuff--move?? Bottom line: IT&#x27;S WONDERFUL.</li>
    <li> We have well water and I have blonde hair. This works amazingly to wash out the brassiness. I use to pay $30 per treatment in a salon until I realized it could purchased for so cheap online!!</li>
    <li> Seriously a miracle product.</li>
    <li> Helps a little bit with brass but only for a day or two before the tint comes back.</li>
    <li> I moved about a year ago and my hair changed dramatically. It felt sticky even right after I washed it. It looked and felt disgusting! It ruined my day. I tried all sorts of remedies for hard water: vinegar, shower filter, baking soda, etc.  I randomly found this when googling hard water treatments and I am beyond happy I found this product. It has taken out all the iron buildup and the brassiness and made it so soft and manageable. It completelf solved a stupid problem that became such a stressor in my life!</li>
    <li> This really works.  I have well water and use the Malibu shampoo and cream rinse for colored hair.  I was not expecting much extra from this but it really brings out my highlights and got rid of the orange color the minerals were creating.  Well worth the investment...on my investment.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT!!! I recommend it to those with dry hair either by the sun or well water. I Love It and the service was above expectation.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for anyone who has well water and is noticing that their hair is dry, frizzy and looking darker than usual. The weekly demineralizer works for me and makes my hair feel softer and easier to style.</li>
    <li> On time delivery and great product!</li>
    <li> I just recently moved into a place with hard water after having a softener my whole life. My color was totally taking a hit. I felt like I needed to get my color done very two weeks. This product is amazing. It brought life back to my blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of your hair after is not the best, but totally worth it</li>
    <li> Eventually I turn into a redhead thanks to well-water.  I have used other products which worked fine, I have used this product for only one treatment and I it removes the red (iron) just as good as other brands.  My hair seems to be a bit softer using Malibu.  I will update my review - good or bad - as time goes on.  But I will say if you are a first-timer looking for a product to try Malibu would be a good choice.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t take out the green tint and left my hair dry. I have well water and i think a water softener is the only remedy.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair that I usually color on a regular basis to hide the effects of my hard water (the ends turn an orangey/red color &amp; I have very dry hair). I decided to give this product a try on the advice of my hairdresser. I love it! After just 3 treatments, I have had people ask if I colored it again! You definitely want to follow the directions and apply heat, I forgot to do it the first time and didn&#x27;t notice as much of a difference. I usually apply it in the shower and put a plastic shower cap on for the 5 minutes so the heat from the shower will do it&#x27;s trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Love this product.  We have lousy water and this really cleans my hair.  Price is good.  Delivery is good.  Very happy. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Because I live in an area with hard water, this was recommended to me. I have light brown hair with some highlights. My hair has a tendency to turn brassy from the sun and water. This product made my hair feel fantastic but did nothing for the brassiness. In fact, my hair looked slightly MORE brassy after use. Proceed with caution!</li>
    <li> I live in a town with mineral-heavy water, including lots of iron, which kills the livelihood of my hair. Using these packets once a week has stopped my hair from holding buildup, even through clarifying shampoo, and has let it get bouncy and light again! I also use Malibu&#x27;s hard water conditioner every wash to combat the buildup between demineralizer sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to live without these, they&#x27;re my Holy Grail hair treatment. Hands down the most important hair product I own.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! If you have hard water, this is a must have item to keep on hand. I use it in the shower, its easy to do and will keep your hair soft and shiny. I pair it with the Hard Water shampoo by Malibu, which I use once a week, and so only use one of these packets once a month or so, unless my hair is starting to feel rough. Follow it up with Pureology conditioner and its a great combo for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a friend who has an extremely bad iron problem in their well.&lt;br /&gt;She swears by the product and can&#x27;t believe how nice her hair looks after using the demineralizer.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Malibu</li>
    <li> My hair feels like my hair again!! So happy! I have well water that is very high in iron and it turned my blonde hair orange. I hated it! I have been struggling with this for a year now and finally a few months ago decided just to dye my hair dark. That helped a little with the orange tint, but didn&#x27;t fully take it away nor did it help with the breakage and crunchiness of my hair. My husband found out about this stuff and ordered it for me (he&#x27;s a sweetie) and my hair finally feels back to normal! It&#x27;s pretty much a miracle treatment. No joke. It&#x27;s taken away the orange tint and helped drastically with breakage and dryness. I highly recommend this to everyone if you have well water. Love the product line!</li>
    <li> I use it once a week.  It has made a big difference in the manageability of my hair.</li>
    <li> I have not found a product that works as well as this one does - Great Product!!</li>
    <li> I moved to an apartment in a city with incredibly hard water. Shortly thereafter my hair felt like straw and started breaking. I tried Malibu C according to the package directions with some benefit, but not a lot. My hairdresser recommended leaving it in for 1/2 hour. I just did that and when I rinsed pellets the size, color and texture of coffee grounds rinsed out into the sink. I have dark brown color treated hair, so that probably explains the color of the granules. Result? My hair feels and looks like it did 6 months ago before I moved. Yippee!</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product!  I have hard water and color-treated hair. It took a lot of the brassiness out. Recommend using weekly.  Product is dry (powder) but when mixed with water, it does lather - FYI.</li>
    <li> I pay a great deal to have my hair highlighted &amp; this product keeps the highlights fresh and removes the brassiness that our well water causes.</li>
    <li> This is basically baking soda I found out.  It didn&#x27;t work, made my hair feel yucky.. We have horrible hard water though.</li>
    <li> After 2 days in the pool in Mexico, my highlighted blonde hair turned green.  After hours of googling, I decided to try soaking my hair in Aspirin dissolved in water.  It did nothing.  So I ordered the Malibu Weekly Demineralizer and prayed it would work.  And it did.  It took out almost all of the green with the very first wash.</li>
    <li> Great product, great transaction.</li>
    <li> I have very hard water and for a blonde that&#x27;s not cool! so once a week I the Malibu and it takes out all the junk in my hair and makes it look great again! Highly recommend this Mailbu treatment!</li>
    <li> We have extremely hard water, and this left my hair very shiny, but feeling totally stripped and brittle, despite using a deep conditioning treatment afterward.  It took about 3 deep conditioning treatments to get my hair feeling normal again.</li>
    <li> I rarely leave reviews, but had to after using this product. My hair had turned orange from our well water and I was disappointed after getting highlights that now my hair was blond on top, but still orange on the bottom. I had purchased the kit which includes these packets and the Malibu C Hard Water Shampoo and Conditioner to use after having my hair done to prevent it from becoming orange again. I used one of these packets the day after the salon and now my hair is all blond! I was shocked it worked so well since I did the toning treatment at the salon and that did nothing. This truly got rid of all the brassiness!</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair and hard water at my house which constanstly leaves my hair brassy with dark yellow and orange streaks. i used this product and instantly i got the color i had wanted. no brass and my hair even feels healthier.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Did exactly what I was hoping it would. I didn&#x27;t even use the whole pack. 2 treatments were enough.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I found this product. I am blonde and have really light highlights that turned orange when we moved into our new house that has well water. I freaked out not knowing what to do but this system got the orange out and I had my expensive hi lites back ;)</li>
    <li> The best product to remove minerals ! Great for volume too ! Love it</li>
    <li> Great product shipped fast</li>
    <li> I really like this hard water treatment since the water in my area has a TON of minerals; however, I can&#x27;t decide if this or a simple apple cider vinegar rinse is better and also much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have used this product once a week for the last several weeks and the green tint is almost gone.  I dye my once naturally blonde hair blonde but the my shower water is hard and I have found that I get a green hue that is NOT attractive.  It is a little difficult to pour the dry crystals into your hand and wet them without them washing to the shower floor.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Reviewed this in the Malibu C treatment kit. 5 stars. Really helps with hard water and makes hair soft.</li>
    <li> After my first use my hair was so soft and the next day at church so many women complimented my hair. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has hard water.</li>
    <li> I used this product about a week after I had my highlights done….the highlights are all gone, I now have literally yellow hair, it completely stripped off the color….$300 worth of highlights are gone. Beware, if you highlight your hair don&#x27;t even try it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference. I have frequently colored hair and hard well water. Using this doesn&#x27;t improve the condition of my hair.</li>
    <li> It seems to make my hair softer and more manageable. I use it once a week to combat the hard water here in Phoenix. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely hard water where I live, which makes it difficult to maintain my color.  I use the Malibu C Hard Water Weekly demineralizer packets before I color my hair to remove the deposits left by hard water.  I also mix a little bit into my shampoo once weekly to help prevent my dyed-blonde hair from turning orange-y.  It really helps!  Buying the 12-pack also saves me money!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I live in NM and we have hard water - I use it on almost every client that I have.  It removes buildup and adds instant shine.  It will completely renew the texture of your/your clients hair.  It DOES sometimes smell - remember, it&#x27;s pulling out the gunk and toxins in your hair.  One client I had, her dogs always peed in the house - no joke, when we were doing her hair, it smelled like urine!  Gross - but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working.  Also, great for blondes that get &amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; or their color changes....it will pull all the toxins out and refresh their color.  I cannot say enough how much I love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  We have a water softener, but still get rust in water &amp; it turns my blond to orange... This is GREAT for removing it!!  I use it with a shower cap &amp; leave on 20-30 minutes for bright, beautiful hair again.;</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used it for the first time the other day and saw and felt a huge difference in my hair. My hair feels cleaner, looks shiny and is very bouncy. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. It kinda smells like baby throw up, but I can definitely sacrifice the smell for the condition it leaves my hair in. I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders on my hair with our hard, well water.</li>
    <li> This product definitely does what it claims.  After using it, my hair is returned to my blonde color straight from the salon look.  It takes out all of the hard water deposits left in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and it did a decent job of leaving my hair soft. I guess I have to keep using it to see if my hair looks any better.</li>
    <li> We have a well that makes my hair brassy due to all the iron in it.  My hairdresser can always tell...  This 5akes it out and makes my hair blond again.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well to strip the red out of my hair due to the high iron content of our water. I use it once or twice a week. It&#x27;s a bit drying, so I always use a heavy-duty conditioner on the days that I use the Malibu treatment. Very easy to use - shampoo/rinse, Malibu, rinse, shampoo/rinse, conditioner. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend this stuff , it works great!</li>
    <li> I have hard well water and i&#x27;m blonde so it turns my hair a nasty shade of rust. This works perfectly and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair</li>
    <li> Yes it works!  With my hard water and iron content, I have to leave it on 10 minutes.  But it does work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product weekly for 2 months and have seen a DRAMATIC improvement in the feel and look of my hair.  Less breakage.  Less frizzyness right after shampooing and the following days. Excellent for hard water.  (We have sulpher, manganese and lots or iron)  I am using this with the wellness shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this product made my hair dry and break right after the treatment.  Beware!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, and great seller. Works easy, easy to follow directions. Have only used it a few times, and already see a big difference.   Thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading the excellent reviews and I am so happy that I did!  I have very hard well water and was about ready to dye my hair brown to avoid the brassy, orange color it was becoming.  However, after one use I can already see a difference and someone told me this morning that my hair was looking blonder and asked if I had it done over the weekend!  Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on in the shower and put a plastic cap on my head to keep the heat in.  I got out and hit it with the hot blow dryer for a couple of minutes, washed it out, conditioned and that was it.  Easy and effective.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I have rusty well water and my hair turns orange and this not only took the orange out but added shine. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> There is absolutely nothing wrong with this product, it just didn&#x27;t do what I was hoping it would.  My hair still has mineral build up from our well water.</li>
    <li> I have used a diffrent brand for a couple of years now....Love this...will not go back,and I really only need to use once per month..will reorder</li>
    <li> useless product. Complete waste of money</li>
    <li> Gets rid of gold/orange tone in blonde highlights</li>
    <li> I am not pleased with this… I had to use more than one packet, and it did not do as it was advertise…. I would not recommend…..</li>
    <li> I wish I&#x27;d known about this product years ago! I finally have a way to get rid of the brassy iron hair that continually frustrated me. My hair also feels much healthier too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years because i have blonde hair and rusty water.  I only use it a couple times a moth but it pulls out any discoloration and gets all the build up out of your hair.  I always use it before i go in to get hightlights!</li>
    <li> My sister is a stylist in Beverly Hills and loves this stuff.  She used it to brighten up my blonde highlights and it worked really well.  There are many stylists that use it at her salon (very upscale place in Beverly Hills), definitely recommend this for blondes!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. We have very bad well water and i have blondish hair and it gets the reddish co&#x27;ll orb out..thanks</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, so that should tell you how fantastic this product is to start.  We have well water and my hair was ORANGE.  I was spending hundreds of dollars a month on blonde highlights, only to have my hair start turning orange again after one week.  By the fourth week, people would be asking me if I put in orange tips on my hair or if I was going strawberry blonde (trying to be kind).  I tried well water shampoo from Malibu and it helped a little, but not much.  I saw this product and the reviews and finally decided to try it.  I was concerned about breakage since I have color processed, very fine hair, but I had absolutely no problem.  In fact, my hair felt softer after just one use!  It took two treatments in one week to get all of the orange out but now I use it once/week followed with a deep conditioner and NO MORE ORANGE!!!  Thank you Malibu!!!  Truly a miracle product!!!</li>
    <li> i have well water with a very high iron content and nothing gets the orange rusty color out of my hair like this product does. those purple shampoos never worked for me, but this does! my only complaint is it seems to dry out my hair a bit</li>
    <li> Oh My Goodness. This product is a miracle in a little tiny package. I have naturally blonde hair but since moving to where I live now a few years ago Ive been dealing with getting orange brassy hair from washing it from the well water. Very frustrating, seeing my pretty honey blonde hair go brassy orange and nothing would get it out other then an expensive trip to the salon.  I heard them say they use this product. So I searched here on Amazon and found it. One application and my hair is back to how it should look, and its fluffy clean no build up feel. Im truly amazed at how quickly this worked. One application. I am going to use it once a week to keep hair my bright shiny blonde. 5 stars ALL the way from me!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, long, dirty blonde hair which I sometimes lighten. After moving to a new apartment, I noticed my hair steadily becoming more and more unmanageable over the months. It was gummy and hard to comb through when it was wet, and brittle when it was dry. I had no idea what was causing it and went through a whole array of hair care products to try and rescue my hair. Eventually it got so bad I wanted to cut it all off out of frustration. Luckily I didn&#x27;t. Instead, I did some research about the water in my area and discovered it was very hard with high chlorine content. I read about Malibu C, bought the packets, and tried them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one use, I noticed a slight difference. However, I realized that even when using the demineralizer once a week, I was still getting mineral and chemical buildup in my hair on the days that I washed my hair and didn&#x27;t use it. So I bought and installed a showerhead filter as well. The results? Amazing! The combined effect of the demineralizer and the filtered water brought my hair back to normal after just one use! It&#x27;s important to also use a reconstructor to fix the damage caused by hard water, even after you&#x27;ve used the demineralizer. I use an argan oil treatment, which really helps bring the shine and moisture back to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps others who have encountered a hair nightmare like mine!</li>
    <li> Amazing product !  Takes rust out of hair and I remain the blonde I like without the yellow !!  I love it !!!!</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time I have color treated hair that has been over processed. I purchased this as part of my plan to get my hair back in shape. It did dry out my hair a little. It did alter the brassiness my hair is a light Auburn. It also turned my grays a golden color which I liked. It does say if you have gray hair don&#x27;t use the product. I do color my hair so I don&#x27;t think every week is going to be good for me I&#x27;ll use it once a month.</li>
    <li> Came in a timely fashion and was as expected</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Massachusetts and while I don&#x27;t have the hardest water out there I did notice my hair never seemed to look good blonde. It always started out with good highlights and white blonde.  Then, I&#x27;d start to look more dish water and dingy. I decided to try Malibu and the first time I applied it to my hair it smelled like blood because apparently all the iron and minerals coming out of my hair. It really brightened my hair up so I continued the regimen of using it once a week. Then I unfortunately went swimming and washed my hair without the packets. All the great work I&#x27;d done resurrecting the light blonde was replaced by the dinginess I despised. So, I&#x27;ve since gotten a filtered showerhead and am looking into a water softener for my entire house. The bottom line is Malibu demineralizer WILL take the gunk out of your hair but if you expose your hair to the same hard water it will re-deposit again.  I should also note it made my hair very soft and as if I&#x27;d gotten a deep conditioning treatment at a salon.</li>
    <li> We heard about this from a hair salon.  We have a lot of iron in our well water.  This product not only took the iron smell out of our hair, but our hair felt super conditioned.  Would highly recommend this to people with similar water conditions.</li>
    <li> I am a the DIY type, this is one of the best products I ever used! I just finished my first box of 12 and about to purchase mt second.My hair is natural however, I am going to try the Miracle Repair treatment as well.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference in the way my hair felt and looked after one use.  Weekly treatments get rid of the buildup and &amp;#34;heaviness&amp;#34; of my hair from our well water.</li>
    <li> After moving into a new state, I was unprepared for the effect of the very hard water on my chemically colored blonde hair.  I soon had ugly orange &amp;#34;streaks&amp;#34; as though someone had taken a wide paintbrush to my hair.  The lavender shampoos I had tried did nothing but drain my bank account.  The only product that has worked was Malibu C!  Not only are the products superb, the company has been fantastic to work with.  I contacted them with a request to find a salon near me and got a quick, courteous response within a day.  My friends and coworkers have noticed the immediate positive changes in my hair and I now tell everyone about Malibu C.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing. Our well water is terrible (north central Indiana). Life happens and sometimes our water softener runs out of salt. My hair is blonde with light blonde highlights and darker low lights. The blonde around my face was turning orange and the lower parts of my hair had tints of orange. Yikes! My salon uses this product and it is a miracle worker. My hair is so soft, shiny, and NOT orange! I buy a couple of packets to keep at home between salon visits. I cannot live without it!</li>
    <li> Five stars all the way! I live in maine, known for major iron issues in our well waters. I&#x27;m a brunette, so thankfully I don&#x27;t have problems with discoloration of my hair, but I do have other issues. Like dry, brittle, oily, gross, hard to brush hair, all because of major iron. This stuff has saved my hair! Now my hair feels light, soft, easy to comb and dry, not oily and dry!  That&#x27;s after one use! I used to LOVE my hair before I moved into my house 1.5 years ago, and I&#x27;ve hated it since then. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I love this product..It removed all the red/rust streaks from my blonde highlighted hair,and left my hair soft and shiny.I highly recommend this product for anyone with well water.</li>
    <li> This product world great. I could see results after one use. I would recommend this product to anyone with hard water.</li>
    <li> We have horrible well water with lots of iron in it which discolors our blonde hair. This is the only product that works for getting out the orange(iron) color. Don&#x27;t bother with the shampoo and conditioner. They don&#x27;t help at all and are very drying. If you want to use the packets once a week you should buy the whole box. Stores will charge you a lot more per box or per packet.</li>
    <li> I have used the packets for about 2 months now and I&#x27;m amazed as to how well it works.  I have extremely hard water to the point it leaves rust stains in the kitchen sink only after washing dishes once.  The tub looks awful after a few days and not to mention my poor hair.  About 5 months ago I put blonde highlights in and to my surprise after washing my just a few times where the blonde was it was now RED.:(  I came across the shampoo and conditioner first then found the packets.  I use the packets once a week and I think it works better than the shampoo/conditioner.  The packets are more economical as well.  I have long thick hair and have to use 2 packets at one time but it&#x27;s definitely worth it to have my original hair color back which is a strawberry blonde.  It does not dry my hair out or strip it either.  It always feels much cleaner after one use!  The seller gets a good review as well....never had an issue</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is an at home treatment. My scalp is all dry and itchy after use. Probably should have had a professional do the treatment</li>
    <li> this works for my hair--so glad I found it.</li>
    <li> Does the job well, except it will wreak havoc on your hair if you use it a lot. I live in a place with hard water, so I had to switch to something by Aveda meant for swimmers because this was screwing up my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product - does what it claims!</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be color safe but it strips the color from my hair.  I use it if necessary but since my hair is colored I do not do so on a regular basis.  If your hair is not colored it works great.  A little tingly on the scalp and can burn a little if your scalp is sore. Leaves a clean feeling on hair and definitely works.</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered this product years ago! If you have well water, you absolutely need this product!</li>
    <li> Must have product for those with hard water.  The smell is somewhat strong, and you can&#x27;t put it directly on your scalp.  Everyone in the family developed dandruff from the water here, but our sanity has been restored with these packets.</li>
    <li> I lived in an apartment with rusty pipes and it ruined my hilighted blonde hair.  I had to cut it pretty much to my shoulders, which is short for me.  Anyhow, after researching EVERY possible solution (including showing exclusively at the gym for a while), I found this stuff and it really helped.  Wash with Purology purple stuff, condition with purology whipped mask, use a little apple cider vinegar to rinse.  It&#x27;s a LOT of work, but it works.</li>
    <li> My hair was in horrible condtion after a week to the desert last year and I came home to use the only pack I had left of malibu Hard Water demineralizer...worked perfect so I had to make sure and order ahead of time this time!  I WILL take pkgs. with me this time!  Thanks for your quick turnaround time!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have hard clear iron water and instead of going and having a malibu treatement every couple of weeks for 20$ I bought these and can do it myself. I use one packet and leave it on bout 10min, works wonders. I do it about every 2wks</li>
    <li> This product took most of the iron deposits out of my hair.  It helped a lot! Thank you to Malibu!</li>
    <li> We have well water that leaves a nasty residue in my hair. This works great and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this my hair seemed rough &amp; dull and smelled metallic.  I emailed the company the next day and found out that there was so much build up in my hair that the first treatment only removed it partially.  So I immediately used another packet (it&#x27;s safe to use daily even though it says \\&quot;weekly\\&quot;) and my hair looks &amp; feels wonderful!  I am not surprised my hair was so bad because our well water leaves brownish scale deposits around our faucets and this is what was in my hair!  My hair had gradually become dishwater brown and after the treatment I can see copper &amp; gold again in my natural hair color that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.</li>
    <li> Appears to be working very well so far - I have completed two treatments and I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell how long it does the trick!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  It does an excellent job of removing the deposits that add up on hair that is washed with well water.  Makes color last longer and highlights stay bright and not brassy.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that has worked on my hair! I&#x27;m on well water and it&#x27;s so harsh and full of minerals that turn my blond hair brassy. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I bought the shampoo/condition and 4 pack of the Hard Water Demineralizer.  The shampoo and conditioner helped, but the packets are amazing. After just one use I noticed a difference in my hair texture, softness and Most of all the color.  I highlight/color my hair and no matter what color I did it, after a few weeks it always turned this disgusting rust orange color.  I moved to CA when I was pregnant with my daughter, and thought it was something from the hormones causing a change in my hair.  It never dawned on me till recently that it was my Hard Water making my once beautiful, shiny, hair so dry, damaged and gross looking.  I literally could color my hair and in two weeks the blonde color looked terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the pack for the 1st time today, and am so impressed I am ordering a 12pk.  I have hair passed my shoulders and found that I only needed to use half a packet.  When I did I could smell all the rust, hard water chemicals, leaching out of my hair.  When I got out of the shower, I noticed the color right away it wasn&#x27;t the nasty color it was before I used it.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has hard water, or has hair that is starting to look like a rusty nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this stuff-either alone or with the shampoo/condition.  I wish I had found this five years ago.  I hope with continued use, my hair will go back to the thick mane it once was.</li>
    <li> I either didn&#x27;t purchase the correct item or it didn&#x27;t work. Any tips on how to remove the effects of well water would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I can&#x27;t believe how well it works! I am very happy with this product. I&#x27;ve tried the Malibu treatments before, but they never really did anything noticeable. I am not sure how to classify my water, but it does leave rust stains in my bathtub and toilet over a period of about three weeks. So I guess it&#x27;s doing the same thing to my hair. Ha!&lt;br /&gt;My hair used to be stiff at the ends. It would almost point straight out when I picked some of it up. Now it&#x27;s just limp and soft. Crazy. After one treatment too. I use it about once a month just to keep it soft.&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with this product. I never would&#x27;ve thought it would work this good. :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these treatments!  We recently moved to a home with hard water I noticed the texture of my hair was changing. I have very thick long hair and it was impossible to get clean. My hair was dry like straw and frizzy. I tried multiple shampoos &amp; conditioners, apple cider vinegar rinses,  we even installed a shower filter with no luck. I finally came across these treatments, they made a huge difference in the texture and feel of my hair. It&#x27;s the only thing that works.</li>
    <li> My daughter said a beautician had used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and she was amazed at the difference she was able to see.  Her dull and brittle looking hair from the minerals in well water was restored to its natural lustre. Able to use it on her 8 and 9 year old daughter&#x27;s hair without problems .</li>
    <li> I like this treatment a lot.  It does what it says.  I have really hard water and need to treat more hair or I&#x27;ll have orange hair. I  have been using the monthly treatments and thought I would try this one.  I liked it.  Afterwards, my hair was soft and clean feeling.</li>
    <li> This removed the brassiness from the bright blond parts of my hair without disrupting the reddish dark blond base (all highlighted/colored). I was a little alarmed to see ascorbic acid as an ingredient since I&#x27;ve used vitamin c powder to lift too-dark color in the past, but my color looks fine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This IS very drying though, so plan to condition thoroughly after. The instructions say to use weekly, but I only wash my very dry and damaged hair once a week; I may use this every 4-6 weeks depending on how quickly I get brassy again.</li>
    <li> I had carrot orange hair from moving into our new house with hard water. Within a week of using the shampoo, conditioner and three packets (I have extremely thick hair so I used two one time) my hair was almost back to normal. After using four packets in total and using the shampoo and conditioner every other day my hair is back to blonde! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product</li>
    <li> this product works!  Esp if used as directed LOL  You can make it yourself but most wouldn&#x27;t so this is a great product.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Malibu 200, which unfortunately I cannot find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> One tretment and my hair was back to its normal color.  I was one very happy lady. I would highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> I have the worst water as far as iron content. My hair has been orange forever. One treatment with this product and it is gone! No more orange hair. I am so happy and will order again!!</li>
    <li> Does the job...is a little bit harsh on the hair...dries it out...but gets out the rust after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for the Malibu Iron-Away product. Removes iron buildup from the use of well water.</li>
    <li> We have hard water and this does the trick. I actually leave it on for 30 minutes and not 5 that is suggested.</li>
    <li> I have very hard well water and this has brought color back to my hair along with shine and softness. Love this product!</li>
    <li> It definitely seems to be making a difference in my hair&#x27;s softness and is reducing the amount of red in it from years of iron water use.</li>
    <li> I live in the Middle East and have chemically treated hair which looked more like straw than hair from the desalinated water.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on products in the hope that my hair would feel somewhat normal. Nothing worked. This product is fantastic, my hair feels soft and silky and shiny, after two treatments..  When I wash my hair I use at least a quarter of the shampoo I was using before and it actually lathers into soft foamy soapy divinity!  I have now ordered the shampoo and conditioner and the swimmers shampoo and use it as a body wash.</li>
