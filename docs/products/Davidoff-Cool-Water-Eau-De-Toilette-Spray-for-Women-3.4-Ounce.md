    <li> &amp;#34;Excelente 100% recomendable&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and have used it for over a decade.  Oddly, this particular batch of perfume is not as potent as I&#x27;m used to from Davidoff.  Usually, I occasionally get a whiff of my perfume throughout the day at work, but I haven&#x27;t had that with this batch of perfume.  Disappointing, but I still love the smell and will continue to purchase this perfume.</li>
    <li> Nice size bottle, great smell</li>
    <li> This is great value for money.. Smell really good and lasts longer than usual or it&#x27;s just me? Will again when it&#x27;s gone</li>
    <li> BEST BUY ONLINE I COULD FIND ON THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;I USE THIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME AND USUALLY HAVE&lt;br /&gt;TO BUY TESTERS BUT THIS BEAT EVEN THAT PRICE</li>
    <li> great price for this scent</li>
    <li> The bottle is not so designed and nice, but the smell is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;me and my wife really loved it.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Cool Water, yet for some reason even though I spritzed it every time I saw it in the store, I never purchased it. A couple of weeks ago I decided to fix that, and was shocked at the price. It has been a bit of time since I purchased scent, but $62? Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw it here, saw that it was the retail package and not a tester, was sold by Amazon, and decided to give it a chance. I&#x27;m so glad I did! What I received is most definitely Cool Water, and the bottle and packaging are fresh and new and pristine - though I&#x27;m keeping it for myself, I could easily give it as a gift. And when I bought it (2/26/14), it was considerably less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, though it said it would take additional days to receive it, I got it the next day... not even the two days through Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite perfume for over 20 years.  It lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Was hoping the negative comments weren&#x27;t true but defnitely not the real thing. Sour and more alcoholic top note and none of the middle or base notes. I went back and the order said the item is non-refundable (doh!) Figure I call customer service and see what happens. Turns out Amazon has amazing customer service and gave me a refund since the item can&#x27;t be return (due to it being a spray and is consider HAZMAT material).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh wells, at least I got my money back. Will go to department store and buy the real thing.</li>
    <li> This was my sister&#x27;s cologne. It reminds me of her....fresh and clean. I am reminded of her every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> Have always loved this perfume for my wife. She loves it and she was happy when I bought it for her.</li>
    <li> Its at a cheap enough price for the size that you are not going to want to pass up at all.</li>
    <li> This product was terrible and smelled nothing like cool water. I tried to return the product but I can&#x27;t since it is listed under hazardous material. Money wasted.</li>
    <li> This perfume lasts long and the scent is not over powering. It is great for all day use and is a definite must have. Lots of heads turn whenever I wear this. Would strongly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past and purchased it because of the price online.  It is a cool, summery fragrance but strong, you only need a little.  Very nice, not too &amp;#34;sweet-smelling&amp;#34;.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s been definitely one of my favourite fragrances for a couple of years now. It&#x27;s perfect for hot summer days, because of its fresh scent. Long-lasting for me, but every woman should be careful with this, it may be not on everyone. This one from amazon is not a fake, it&#x27;s the same as I used to buy in the perfume store.</li>
