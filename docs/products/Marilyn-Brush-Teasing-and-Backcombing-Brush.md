      <li>I believe that the brush is a good quality brush, too, with its boar hairs.  </li>
      <li>This just did not work as good as others that I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t brush your hair so good, just a good teasing brush.</li>

      <li>Good price for a good product that has been used many many times.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I got this brush because most people I know have this brand teasing brush.</li>
      <li>Better than I could buy @ the salon.</li>
      <li>Glad i purchased</li>
      <li>Almost too many bristles.</li>
      <li>I had one of these for many years and it just disappeared--go figure.  </li>
      <li>The best I&#x27;ve found for minimal backcombing.  </li>
      <li>The brush just does not cooperate with poufing my ultra fine blond hair by teasing.  </li>
      <li>So, re-ordered and happily it was the same as the one I had.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not sure that good for fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it didn&#x27;t tease much, even a regular comb teases better.</li>
      <li>I used a similar brush years ago &amp; haven&#x27;t been able to find another one until this Marilyn brush.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I thought.</li>
      <li>I have a much better one that I paid the same amount for on Amazon also.</li>
      <li>I have very fine short straight hair.  </li>

      <li>This brush had high ratings</li>
      <li>I suspect that my expectations were really high for having the Marilyn Brush give me a pouf where needed.  </li>
      <li>Arrived on time and new as advertised.</li>
      <li>This brush works like a charm and makes it look natural.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair, and most positive reviews were from ladies with thin hair.</li>

<li> Brush does what it says it will do, I like that the bristles are stiff but not hard.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve only had it around 2 months with very minimal use.</li>
<li> I think this brush would work for thicker hair, just not fine hair like mine.  </li>
<li> Although I have felt disappointed in what the brush can do for me personally, I do believe it&#x27;s the major factor of hair type that is in play here, not the brush.</li>
<li> I was really disappointed it did not tease my hair as I wished.</li>

    <li> Love it! Something to get used to, but works great! Great price online. Better than I could buy @ the salon.</li>
    <li> Not just for backcombing... it is awesome for detangling.</li>
    <li> This brush had high ratings so I thought I would try it. I was really disappointed it did not tease my hair as I wished. I have thick hair, and most positive reviews were from ladies with thin hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for thicker hair.</li>

    <li> Works on all hair types. Good price for a good product that has been used many many times. Arrived on time and new as advertised.</li>
    <li> Almost too many bristles.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me at all</li>
    <li> I got this brush because most people I know have this brand teasing brush. I was impressed when I first got it, and I&#x27;m still pretty impressed now. It absolutely does its job very well. I gave it 4 stars because the bristles are already falling out and I&#x27;ve only had it around 2 months with very minimal use.</li>
    <li> It works well to add some body to your hair by teasing it and is easier on your hair than the combs are.</li>
    <li> This brush works like a charm and makes it look natural. I watched the YouTube video to get pointers on how to use it. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really quite stiff and I&#x27;m not sure that good for fine hair.</li>
    <li> This just didnt do it for me. I have a much better one that I paid the same amount for on Amazon also. This just did not work as good as others that I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
