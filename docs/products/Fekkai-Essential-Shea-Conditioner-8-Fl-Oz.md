<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this conditioner in conjunction with the Shea Butter Shampoo. I love this conditioner. It smells just as heavenly as the shampoo. I have waist length, curly hair and since this conditioner has such great slip, I was able to detangle easily in seconds using only my fingers. My hair dried soft and smells absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The best product I found</li>
    <li> Best conditioner for coarse hair</li>
    <li> Have been using the shampoo and conditioner for about a month. I used to use regular store brands (treseme, garnier, etc)...but my hair was not very soft or shiny, so was recommended my my stylist to try something of better quality. Then I gave this a try after finding it at Target. My hair has never been softer! and it seems to be shiner too. I plan to keep using this!</li>
    <li> Leaves my coarse gray hair soft and supple.</li>
    <li> I love it.  My hairs looks much better.  Not fly away and my hair is very soft.  Price was good. Delivery was fast.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and the matching shampoo.  Using them both makes my hair so silky soft and it feels cleaner than I have had it feel with other conditioners.  I really hate it when you have a greasy after feel that leaves you wondering if you have even washed your hair.  I do think though that the fragrance could be tapered just a bit.  I like the smell of it but it is a bit strong for me.</li>
    <li> Great for thick hair that build up wax</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Fekkai products for years now and hate to give only 3 stars, but this conditioner isn&#x27;t what I need.  I have &#x27;problem&#x27; hair, and I need something with more slip for better detangling.  I have to leave this conditioner in for too long before it softens my hair enough to comb through it.  It&#x27;s worth a try for those with hair that&#x27;s naturally more manageable, but I probably won&#x27;t repurchase this particular conditioner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s conditioner and it&#x27;s nothing out of the ordinary. Expensive for what it is... I&#x27;ll stick to my KPak as it&#x27;s a cleaner rinse.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and love this product!!</li>
    <li> This product was great- as expected.  I would recommend this.  I will buy again as needed.  Thanks so very much!</li>
    <li> This is a thick, hydrating conditioner that smells like Hawaiian gardenias... Makes my hair silky, but still light and not weighted down. The scent stays on my hair for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> One of the best fekkai products! Amazing for dry or treated hair.  You will notice the difference! Immediately after a few times.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive hair stuff, but I had a sample fo this conditioner and to my surprise, my hair looked better than it ever has, so I was willing to spring for a full bottle!  Horribly overpriced, but what price beauty?</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have ever tried.  I have thick curly hair and most conditioners seem to be too light and don&#x27;t leave my hair soft.  But this conditioner works great on my thick hair and my daughter&#x27;s baby fine hair.  Even with my longer, thicker hair, I only need to use a small amount and it works great.  It always leaves my hair super soft and tangle free.  I sometimes get the urge to try different conditioners but always come back to this one.  I&#x27;ve tried several salon and drugstore brands but this one works the best and this bottle lasts me 2 to 3 months of daily use.</li>
    <li> I initially thought this Fekkai Essential Shea Conditioner would turn out to be a very heavy masque-like conditioner.  I have natural blond hair that is baby fine but I have a lot of it.  It has a texture that can sometimes almost be like bleached hair.  This means that it breaks off very easily.  It also tangles easily because it is fine.  I have to use deep conditioners several times a week, but I also have to be carefule what type I use so that it doesn&#x27;t look weighed down and greasy.  However, if I don&#x27;t use a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; enough conditioner, my hair is very tangly and looks dried out. Another problem I have is that a lot of discount/drug store brands make my scalp flake and itch (but so does ALL Paul Mitchell products, so it&#x27;s not only the cheap stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many, many different conditioners over the years.  My favorite has turned out to be Fekkai&#x27;s Glossing Conditioner.  So that is the conditioner I compare others to.  I didn&#x27;t think I would like the floral scent of this Shea conditioner.  I normally like the clean/fresh or fruity smell in my hair products and perfume.  Fekkai Shea Conditioner&#x27;s floral smell is amazing!!!  I caught myself the day after using it (wash my hair at night) swinging my head around so that I could catch a light whiff of it.  The conditioner definitely didn&#x27;t give me a deep, deep condition like I thought it would.  I found that I had to use a LOT more of it than the Glossing conditioner to be able to get out my tangles.  I keep a wide-toothed comb in my shower to comb through my conditioner.  I had a lot of trouble getting this combed through.  My hair did look very nice when I fixed it the next day, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary -- I LOVE the smell of Fekkai Shea Conditioner and my hair looked nice when I fixed it the day after using this conditioner, but I had to use way too much of the product to get a comb through my hair.  If you don&#x27;t have hair that tangles extremely easily, then you should try this conditioner.  If you have tangly hair, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.ioner.  If you have tangly hair, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> The shea shampoo and conditioner set are my favorite, followed by brilliant glossing.  I use the apple cider shampoo once every week or two, also.  My hair just thrives with the Fekkai products.  It&#x27;s light, airy and full-bodied after using.</li>
    <li> I used Fekkai Essential Shea Conditioner along with the coordinating shampoo and I love it. It&#x27;s fragrance is \\&quot;jasmine and exotic florals\\&quot;. To me, the scent is a little different from the shampoo but both of them together creates a lovely, lingering scent in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this shampoo and coordinating conditioner exclusively and have noticed my hair looks and feels smooth for at least 3 days and then I wash my hair anyway. I do recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I do NOT like about these two products (shampoo &amp; conditioner) is that they are the same size, same style, same color, same font. I would recommend that there be a more noticeable way to tell them apart while you are in the shower or else you&#x27;ll grab the wrong bottle. Maybe one can have a colored top and one white or clear. Maybe the words \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; could be in a weightier font. Something needs to be addressed. Other than that, this is a quality conditioner and with a lot of quality hair care products, you pay more for them. As you only need a little bit at a time, this should last you a while, thereby making the cost not so difficult to digest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: I have used this conditioner for 6 months and still have enough left for a couple of weeks. I typically wash my hair 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> My first sniff of this bottle, and I recognized the product as very fragrant. Now, I like fragrance, I really do, and I consider myself a bit of a fragrance snob. So I feel qualified to comment on the fragrance. The product&#x27;s fragrance struck me as high quality but as too floral for many people, especially guys and anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shower, it actually smells first as citrus, a nice brisk citrus. However, in the hair it the scent settles down to a floral. The fragrance is actually pretty high quality, which the fragrance snob in me appreciates. However, since I&#x27;m not keen on florals, I wasn&#x27;t initially keen on this. I was even less keen on it when I realized my hair was attracting yellow jacket wasps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fragrance in a product that attracts flying insects? Yes. Although synthetic, the fragrance is so good that it attracts insects. Now, that&#x27;s a good thing and a bad thing. The good thing -- it&#x27;s a high quality scent. The bad thing -- you will find flying insects near you and in your hair in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product twice. On the first time, I noticed yellow jackets hovering near me when I was outside. On the second time, I combed my fingers through my hair and I was stung. I was able to react quickly and minimize the pain &amp; inflammation, but I was stung because there was a wasp in my hair. First time ever that has happened to me, and the only thing different ... this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, you&#x27;re probably thinking, that was a fluke. And, it may have been. I don&#x27;t like the floral scent, so let me deduct 1 star for that and nothing for the wasp sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to product performance ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Shea Shampoo and Conditioner in combination. The shampoo is rich and lathers nicely. The conditioner is thick and indulgent. I would say that my hair felt softer to the touch after use. However, in the depth of summer I really need something to quell the frizzies, and this product surprisingly did not do that for me. So, I&#x27;ll deduct another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a heavily fragranced product that would work best for hair that needs to be softened. However, don&#x27;t expect it to repel insects or tame frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** I received the product in exchange for honest review &amp; candid opinion.

    <li> If you&#x27;re using the shampoo, you must get the conditioner to compliment it. The conditioner is the finishing touch in helping keep my hair soft and mostly frizz-free.  It&#x27;s still got some roughness, but I live in Arizona where it&#x27;s really dry so it seems my hair always has some dryness to it.  although my hair is crazy because it gets oily yet some frizz on the ends.  I also use a blow dryer daily so that causes damage, too.  Still i really like the Fekkai line of hair care products and the Shea shampoo/conditioner are no exception.  The conditioner has a nice, light scent like the shampoo.  And, like the shampoo, you don&#x27;t need much - a little goes a long way.  Which is great since this product is not cheap.  It is as good, if not better, than the products I&#x27;ve purchased from the salon at an even higher price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;together the Fekkai Shea shampoo and conditioner are a great combination for my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful very conditioning brought life back to my hair</li>
    <li> Part of my daily curly hair regimen.  Hands down fabulous.</li>
    <li> I was told this was the new version of the Ironless series which I adored. The scent of this is cheap and overpowering and though I tried using a tiny bit, it feels like I can&#x27;t rinse it out, and then feels like my hair is burdened by product.  What&#x27;s up?  Bought it at a store I can&#x27;t return to. This is the worst conditioner I have ever tried at this price point.  Disappointing.  Will stick to Glossy series, AND Pravana gentle straightening cream.</li>
    <li> I just tried this brand for the first time (both shampoo and conditioner) a few weeks ago and I have to say that I am completely sold. Using both products together, my hair was so much more silky, smooth, and manageable than my old brand, which I thought I loved. I have thick, somewhat wavy hair that has a bit of a mind of its own, but this stuff really helped to tame it. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner. The consistency is not overly thick like some I&#x27;ve used, and the scent is light and pleasant without being overly floral or artificial-smelling. It leaves my hair tangle-free and feeling soft but not weighed-down, and rinses out easily. I have curly hair that tends to frizz, and the Fekkai products do a good job of helping to manage the frizz to bring out the best in my curls.</li>
    <li> If I had to pick my very favorite Fekkai shampoo/conditioner line, it would be the shea.  I like the Shea conditioner as well as the Pureology Hydrate conditioner that costs more. I liked this Fekkai shea conditioner SO MUCH that I bought a bottle of the shampoo to see if it made a difference to use it with the conditioner.  (LOVE love their shea products!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Pureology Hydrate fan for a long time and always go back to it. I test other brands as the opportunity arises, and just never find anything that makes me want to leave Pureology. I think Fekkai delivered that magical combination of price, results, and fragrance experience with their Shea products. WINNER, winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can mix/match shampoos and conditioners, so far there hasn&#x27;t been one Fekkai hair product that I have disliked. Most of them I either like or LOVE, and I think this conditioner would be a bonus to any shampoo you picked. You only need a little bit, I have long hair down to my bra strap in back and I use probably a nickel/quarter sized amount. It washes out easily, leaves hair silky but not coated. Detangles, too!  I&#x27;ve decided that when my gallon-sizes of Pureology Hydrate are gone, Fekkai is going to be my new brand. It&#x27;s not only cheaper but honestly the results are as good as (I daresay could be even BETTER THAN, with the shea line) the Pureology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could make me happier is to see Fekkai coming back out with their discontinued purple shampoo for blonde hair. Everyone raved about it, why was it discontinued? I&#x27;m making do with Joico purple shampoo but I&#x27;d bail on that in seconds flat if I could get ahold of Fekkai-branded purple color correcting shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything I&#x27;ve tried from Fekkai has exceeded my expectations so far. I&#x27;ve been able to start enjoying my hair again after struggling for so long learning how to work with damaged, bleached hair. It looked pretty crappy for awhile, when it&#x27;s damaged you can&#x27;t just &#x27;wash and go&#x27; any more. Now with the Glossing Cream, Shea Pot de Cr&amp;egrave;me (and Christophe Serum) I&#x27;m able to pass off my damaged hair as healthy hair. I think the shea shampoo/conditioner are really helping in that department too, as my hair comes out of the shower ready to style...no tangles and knots, it&#x27;s not dry and parched. Just happy and silky!go&#x27; any more. Now with the Glossing Cream, Shea Pot de Crème (and Christophe Serum) I&#x27;m able to pass off my damaged hair as healthy hair.

    <li> While I really liked the matching [[ASIN:B00FRDPRBW Fekkai Shea Shampoo]], I was a little disappointed in the conditioner.  Unlike [[ASIN:B00FRD6T64 competing anti-frizz conditioners]], the Fekkai conditioner never really felt like it rinsed out, so it left my hair coated in a (albeit thin) layer of gunk that just didn&#x27;t feel clean.  So while the good news is that it kept my wildly unruly hair in check even during the sticky-hot southern summer days, it did so at the cost of looking and feeling wholly clean.</li>
    <li> This is great conditioner. It has that rich Shea scent, and feels wonderful when applied to the hair and scalp. It thins out quickly though, and isn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34; as I expected. Still, it is a good product that leaves hair soft but not weighed down after rinsing. Packaging is classy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> This is fine, but it leaves my hair feeling heavy. I love the shampoo, but I&#x27;m not sure I will use this conditioner again. Like I said it&#x27;s not bad...it just seems to leave a film on my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a long time, as it works miracles on my dry, coarse and brittle hair. A little goes a long way, and from the moment it hits your hair, you notice the smoothing, softening effect and the wonderful fragrance. After a few minutes, it rinses out easily and completely, leaving hair transformed - softer, less frizzy and generally healthier looking in every way. This is among my favorite day to dat conditioners of all the products I&#x27;ve ever tried, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you give it a try.</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner for chemically treated hair, dry or coarse hair. This is very rich and only a little bit is all you need to work very gently from the roots of your hair down to the tips, don&#x27;t rub your hair but gently run your fingers through it. You feel the tangles effortlessly untangle themselves and you barely need a comb after you rinse and gently wrap your hair in a towel. It&#x27;s made real Shea oil but does NOT weigh it down. When you rinse your hair it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s it feel weighed down. It is like a very expensive salon shampoo at much less the cost. I very highly recommend it and I will be a repeat buyer-I&#x27;m hooked. As I color my hair the ends are always dry and the roots oily&#x3D;this is perfec</li>
    <li> The Fekkai Essential Shea conditioner is pricey but works well to smooth and detangle long hair.  I have short wavy hair and this worked very well to add a nice shine and left my hair very soft.  My daughter has long curly hair and it worked well to detangle the ends.  The only downside is that it does tend to cause your hair to frizz a bit at least the few times I have used it so far.  The price is a bit on the high side though in line with other Fekkai products.</li>
    <li> I got this along with their apple cider shampoo. The conditioner feels good when applied and smells good, too. It seems to go well with the shampoo. One thing that holds me back is whether I can use this daily or only weekly as with the shampoo. The price also seems a little high.</li>
    <li> Fekkai offers an exceptional conditioner with Fekkai Essential Shea Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;As they say, this is decadent.&lt;br /&gt;It is the perfect treatment for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai Essential Shea Conditioner doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It just defrizzes, adds soft texture, and makes your hair shine!&lt;br /&gt;Another Fekkai winner!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Fekkai Essential Shea Conditioner for testing purposes and I must say, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! Well let me just say it in one word.... FABULOUS!!! I don&#x27;t usually look at the instructions but I did this time for some reason. It said to concentrate on the ends not the scalp, of course I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m glad I did! My hair is soft, manageable and just beautiful. My hair hasn&#x27;t looked this good in ages. I highly recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> I enjoy how &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; it leaves my hair.  No tangles</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I like that it is thick and lasts a long time for a small bottle. Other conditioners I go through really fast with my long hair.</li>
    <li> Fekkai conditioners have been hit or miss for me.  This one isn&#x27;t bad, relatively speaking.  First, a little goes a fairly long way: it doesn&#x27;t take half of the container&#x27;s contents to coat my long, coarse hair.  After using it, my hair was softer, shinier, and more manageable.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with tangles.  And the smell is pleasant--it&#x27;s powerful enough to hang around for a long time, but not so overwhelming that it&#x27;s all you can smell or that it competes with perfume or anything of that nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I feel as though this conditioner infused my hair with moisture or gave me any kind of incredible result? Not really.  All in all, I found that it didn&#x27;t have benefits along those lines that can&#x27;t be found with any cheap, drugstore conditioner.  Therein lies my biggest issue with this product: it&#x27;s pricey and the bottle is not exactly huge.  For that kind of money, I would expect very good results, but this conditioner was too run-of-the-mill for that.  In my view, it&#x27;s nothing special and the results can just as easily be obtained with the use of a conditioner by Suave or Garner or one of their ilk, for a fraction of the price of this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is just okay - it&#x27;s not groundbreaking or a miracle worker, and as such, I can&#x27;t say that I feel the cost is justified or worth it.</li>
    <li> I got this conditioner as part of a free sample box.  The smell is super light and lovely jasmine, which lasts quite nicely in my hair.  As for performance, this is a very rich, thick, conditioner which my curly hair needs.  It has good slip and rinses out pretty easily.  Highly recommend for dry and/or curly hair.</li>
    <li> I received this product as complimentary for testing purposes.  It is an awesome product!  The fragrance  is very nice-not too strong.  My dry hair feels very soft and manageable after use as well as feeling strong.  Though it is a bit tough to rinse out, its worth the extra time to do so.</li>
    <li> great fruity smell - good pudding like thick consistency.  I wish it opened from the bottom though.</li>
    <li> My hair feels healthier and softer!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they quit making the one for curly hair. I loved it. This one was okay, but did not have the smell I wanted.</li>
    <li> Oh yum!!  What a delicious, creamy jasmine scent.  This conditioner really does a nice job of moisturizing my hair and scalp.  I found it to be easy to rinse from my hair and left it easy to comb out  I have used other shea butter products and like how they restore my skin.  Fekkai does a nice job of using it in a conditioner without making it too heavy.  Unfortunately the jasmine scent does not last long.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse hair with some strange texture challenges. After using this about 6 times, I feel like there&#x27;s been some improvement in the texture and smoothness of my hair overall. This conditioner is very effective and leaves my wet hair feeling slick and smooth. When it dries, my hair is still soft and smoother than it normally is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it with a few different shampoos with similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Softens and smooths my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The scent is so strong it makes my eyes water&lt;br /&gt;Lots of chemicals  - several parabens</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used other Fekkai products in the past and have been pleased with the results, and Fekkai Essential Shea conditioner is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This premium conditioner doesn&#x27;t skimp on the shea butter, making for a creamy but never greasy-feeling application, leaving dry, brittle hair notably soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a tiny bit goes a long way, meaning an 8-ounce bottle should last you quite a while.  What we don&#x27;t care for with this formula is the floral scent that goes a bit too heavy on the jasmine.  By comparison, the formula for Fekkai&#x27;s Brilliant Glossing styling cream has a much lighter botanical scent that doesn&#x27;t make you want to sneeze every time you pop the lid!</li>
    <li> ...I love the aroma but it really doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;condition\\&quot; my hair. I must say that I have not experienced any noticeable difference. But it sure does smell good. And it takes a lot of rinsing to get off of your body (you know it&#x27;s all off when your skin doesn&#x27;t have that slippery feel to it).</li>
    <li> Combined with the shampoo this really did wonders for my dry coarse hair. It has now become my #1 shampoo and conditioner medley. Not only does it quench my hair but it also smells great too. As I mentioned with the shampoo I just wished that they came in bigger bottles so I can have it last longer.</li>
    <li> This is a luxury conditioner and smells great; herbal and not too flowery. It has a thicker texture than most everyday conditioners; closer to the thickness of a hair treatment cream.  I was a bit worried it would weigh down my fine, wavy hair but in fact it goes on smoothly and washes clean from the hair.  A little goes a long way, and the scent pervades after hair is clean, which makes it extra appealing (Fekkai&#x27;s products all tend to smell really great, in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The reason we give this product four stars instead of five is because although it works extremely well, it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive for an 8-oz bottle. There are some conditioners on the market that work even better than this one, at half the price. However, it&#x27;s a lovely product and I can see how it would be anyone&#x27;s go-to conditioner, if the price wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> The Fekkai Shea Conditioner is good, but it is not the best I have used for my hair needs.&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is a tight curl typical to African-Americans, it needs a conditioner that give long lasting moisture-effect without greasy oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;the Fekkai conditioner does give some moisture, but it is short lived.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the instructions seem to imply that the conditioner should be applied mostly to the hair, not the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Since the hair and the scalp are closely connected, and the scalp also needs conditioning, I found that a little strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be a good conditioner for someone who doesn&#x27;t have naturally dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have ordered conditioner and got shampoo. VERY unhappy.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of the conditioner. It smelled like a mixture of cherries and jasmine. I used this conditioner after the Essential Shea shampoo. I did not have to use a lot. I am African-American with dry, natural hair and my hair soaks up moisture. I was not impressed with the performance of this conditioner. After using it, my hair did not have much of a shine, was not so soft and did not feel moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and my honest review.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick, very coarse, curly and can be frizzy. I&#x27;ve been using the same shampoo and conditioner for a while now and am happy with that product. This was a change up for me. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have too strong a smell, nor is it too flowery. It&#x27;s very clean scent, but not really a scent I enjoy for conditioner. It left my hair sort of heavy, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product on a regular basis. I felt like it weighed down my curls instead of helping them stay bouncy. It left my hair feeling nice and silky, which I enjoyed.  All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on a regular basis, and find I went back to my regular conditioner after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I received this conditioner and the Shea butter shampoo as a complimentary sample to use and then review.  My hair is very thick and with age (over 40) has gotten very dry.  The conditioner has a nice smell and it says to not use on scalp but to use on the ends of the hair as I have never seen directions like that on other conditioners.  I did as directed and the results have been smooth, shiny, silky and no knots.  I am happy with this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It&#x27;s very silky and you don&#x27;t need much to get the hydration you need. The smell is really nice and pleasant but not too overpowering. When paired with the shampoo it makes your hair amazing, hydrated, easy to style and shiny. This is now a staple of my routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from Influenster :)</li>
    <li> First off I have to say I writing this review for my wife.  Personally I don&#x27;t have enough hair to need a product like this.  She says it is the only product she has ever found to keep her hair ends from breaking.  She does have beautiful hair- so we are subscribing and saving on this.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells AMAZING!!!  I absolutely love the scent!!  It is also super moisturizing and that helps a lot with my dry/frizzy long hair.  I use a flat iron on my hair and it has a tendency to get static and frizzy especially near my scalp.  This conditioner really smoothed out my hair and made it more manageable while styling.  Overall a fantastic product!!  (I received a 2oz complimentary sample for testing/review)</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product from Influenster and I was able to use the product for about a week.  I was pleasantly surprised by the scent and how well it moisturized my hair. I would recommend it to my friends with dry or color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it every time I wash my hair.  I put it in and massage it into my hair and I let it sit in my hair for 5 minutes before rinsing.  This product has helped my hair fight frizz and as someone who has very very curly hair, I am often fighting to keep my hair smooth and feeling hydrated.  Fekkai Shea conditioner allows me to keep my hair feeling smooth and hydrated.  I would recommend this for anyone with curls or for anyone who needs some added moisture for their hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a co-washing girl for the last 3 years until I received a sample of the Shea Shampoo and Conditioner. After each use my hair is left soft and tangle-free. I&#x27;ve seen a difference with my ends and my scalp is moisturized/flake free.  I won&#x27;t be going back to using Carol&#x27;s Daughter. Full disclosure: I receive this product as part of a sampling program.</li>
    <li> After using the shampoo, the conditioner sealed the deal for me. My hair was tangle-free, extremely soft, and manageable. I like this product a lot!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is so moisturizing for my dry hair I leave it in while I shower then rinse right before I get out.  It smells excellent and the smell lasts for at least two days.</li>
    <li> Got it right away and it did not look like it had been sitting around for a year.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is thick and rich, but never leaves my hair feeling weighed down. While my hair is generally easy to manage (long and straight), the ends do get dry pretty quickly. This product leaves my hair looking and feeling healthy, much like it does after a fresha haircut. Definitely worth the price, it&#x27;s like a small indulgence for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product complimentary from Influenster.</li>
    <li> I jumped at the chance to try FEKKAI ESSENTIAL SHEA CONDITIONER 8 FL OZ. My daughter has thick, course, frizzy hair. We are always on the lookout for a product to help tame her uncontrollable hair. The price was a concern, but if the product did what it promised, it would be worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just one use, I noticed a huge difference in my daughter’s hair. Wow! Her hair was shinny, silky smooth, and the frizzy was contained to an astonishing amount. I used both the shampoo and conditioner and was surprised at how soft and silky my hair felt. I too have frizzy, course hair, and the FEKKAI products made it as though I didn’t. Even a day later, my hair still feels clean and wonderfully soft and silky, with no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell out of the bottle is nothing to write home about, but that matters little when a product works so well. I was surprised that you only needed a small amount of conditioner for it to work. That’s not typically the case. The shampoo lathers up, great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the bottle it tiny, and the cost, large. But if you used only a small amount with each use, and taking into consideration how well it works, it’s well worth the money for those that have tried endless products that fail to contain their frizzy, unhealthy looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information&lt;br /&gt;-Infused with pure Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;-Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.&lt;br /&gt;-Quench hair in moisturizing indulgence.&lt;br /&gt;-Coarse, dry hair is smoothed to fluidity.&lt;br /&gt;-Tip from the Fekkai Salon: Concentrate conditioner on the ends of hair and avoid the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;-Detangles and moisturizes each strand.&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth hair daily with the decadent cleansing experience of Essential Shea Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety Warning&lt;br /&gt;Avoid contact with eyes.

    <li> To be honest, this product kinda let me down.  For the price, which isn&#x27;t that bad, but it could have been better.  Smell isn&#x27;t that good....doesn&#x27;t feel like it accomplishes it&#x27;s mission.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t we all tried just about every Shampoo and Condtioner advertised on the market today?  All the  advertisements suggest and promise miracles for your hair. Personally both the Shea Butter Fekkai Shampoo and Conditoner deliver that magic in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: A little goes a long way creating a luxurious leather. This is for the shampoo, the conditioner  is best for just the ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is beautiful , have allergies to 99% of the smells offered today... This one is soft, sweet and lasts a few days.&lt;br /&gt;It rinses out easily ( both Conditoner and Shampoo)&lt;br /&gt;Best results are achieved when used both in conjunction with each other to get the most glamourous results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using the Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditoner for years, occasionally try other products and ALWAYS come back to my tried and true all time favorite wonderful Fekkai. Simply the Best... Enjoy! ❤❤❤</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt softer. I did leave it in for about 8 minutes and concentrated it on my ends but I have very dry hair and many moisturizing shampoos and conditioner leave it feeling heavy or greasy- this one is weightless. Love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this conditioner.  It smells like Hawaii (I think it is plumeria??)  My frizzy hair just sucks up that shea butter moisturizer and responds well to it.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> I suggest using this with the Shea Shampoo for the ultimate luxury experience, this conditioner is serious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s thick and creamy, it coats the hair in cream and Shea and the most amazing Jasmine scent, it&#x27;s everything you want in a conditioner. I don&#x27;t even have to leave in more than a minute of two to see results, it untangles the hair and makes it very smooth and fresh, most heavy duty conditioners weight it down but never with this stuff, I love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years. I have African American fine hair that can be very dry and limp. When I first started using it, I had a friend doing my hair every 6-8 weeks unaware that I had switched conditioners. She noticed a significant change in the texture of my hair. She expressed that it was softer and felt more moisturized. She wanted to know what I had done. That&#x27;s when I let her know that I had switched to Fekkai hair care products. I had already noticed a difference but what confirmed it was when my friend noticed. I have been using this product ever since. I would definitely recommend it for this type of hair.</li>
    <li> Just takes a little!!!! Very rich. Great product....the fragrance is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, color treated hair - this stuff get out all my tangles in seconds and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as it makes my hair feel so soft. My hair dress he asked what I was using told him this product.</li>
    <li> I have weird hair. I used to have nice hair, then something happened (middle age) and suddenly I have this head of hair that&#x27;s at war with itself. About half of it is still my original blonde straight fine and glossy hair, the other half is this weird gray kinky stuff. Needless to say, it&#x27;s hard to find hair products that work for this mess. Harder still to find any product that tames the evil gray kinky stuff without completely flattening the fine blonde strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this shea-based product, unfortunately I haven&#x27;t seen results that are any different than I get from cheap store-bought conditioners. It doesn&#x27;t do any better at de-tangling, and I still have those annoyingly grizzled-looking hairs that refuse to be tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, if a bit floral for my tastes. A downside is that it attracts insects, this is especially annoying when we&#x27;re hiking and every mosquito and bee seems to find me more interesting than the surrounding flora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does feel very nice and soft after using this product, but I&#x27;d rather have it look nice than feel nice, and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t help its appearance at all, so I&#x27;ll go back to my regular inexpensive product.</li>
    <li> The Fekkai conditioner is soothing, refreshing, and has an enjoyable smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have low-maintence, thin hair, but the shea butter helped moisturize my hair ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This used with the Fekkai moisturizing shampoo worked really well for me.  My past the shoulder long curly hair felt soft, soft, soft and looked great. I love the smell of this conditioner. Smells so good! I&#x27;m in the pool and ocean a few times a week, so this is just what I need to have my hair looking great. It certainly did the trick and I love this conditioner.  It gives shine and body but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you use as I did and leave it in for at least 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> This makes my coarse hair smooth :)</li>
    <li> I was given this to try and expected expected great results since it has silicones (I dont use silicones) and those provide great slip for tangles. It felt smooth &amp; creamy when put into my hair &amp; smells like heaven.But when I rinsed it out of my dense,dry super curly 3b/c hair it still felt dry surprisingly.</li>
    <li> This and the shampoo&#x3D;amazing pair. I would love to try styling products from this line now. This conditioner smells wonderful (I didn&#x27;t care as much for the scent of the shampoo). It feels great in my hair and seems to coat it after rinsing. It detangled my ling, curly hair that is never combed unless in the showed with usually TONS of conditioner. With this, my hair that is to my lower back and very curly and frizzy, only needed about 2 tablespoons in the palm of my hand and wooah-lah instant smoothness. I&#x27;m letting my hair air dry after use to see how it works on frizz. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Just received a sample of this product from Influenster.  I tried it on my hair today and I have to say it made my hair so soft and silky and really controlled the frizz.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has dry frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> I have long and heavy hair and was really concerned about how this would affect the texture of my hair.  I had never used any of the fekkai products but when I tried this one, I was instantly amazed at how healthy my hair felt. My hair is thick and coarse and the Fekkai Essential Shea Conditioner helped to smooth out my hair and left it laying flat on my back without all of the frizz and coarseness. The smell was wonderful and my hair smelled this was for most of my day. I will definitely be purchasing in the future.</li>
