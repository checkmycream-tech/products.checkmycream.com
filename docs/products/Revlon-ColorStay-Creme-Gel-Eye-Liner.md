### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am going to stick with L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s wonderful HIP gel liner (although I don&#x27;t like the brush that comes with it).</li>
      <li>should have stuck with the Revlon Colorstay Liquid Liner which is the best eyeliner out there in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It is the best liner I ever have had.</li>
      <li>is the best part</li>
      <li>wonderfully-</li>
      <li>The brush is a brilliant applicator</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>Looks great.</li>
      <li>I did my research now (needing a replacement), and found great reviews for both M.A.C. and Maybelline gel</li>
      <li>then it works just great.</li>
      <li>Great value for the money, and wonderful for someone like me who travels often and needs an easy-to-use, quick, portable make-up solution!</li>
      <li>I bought this product because the price was good</li>
      <li>The pigment is good, I guess, and it&#x27;s matte.</li>
      <li>The brush is good, but the product is not,  I use the brush with a competitor creme eyeliner bc</li>
      <li>Good price, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is excellent.</li>
      <li>I really liked Revlon&#x27;s liquid eyeliner, then I started getting into gel liners.</li>
      <li>This gel liner goes on very smooth, evenly, and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>I love that it stays on my eyes, in place all day.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>my favorite eye liner</li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
      <li>Everything ok as announced.</li>
      <li>product is more of a.....paste than a liquid.</li>
      <li>so I can get something better.</li>
      <li>I picked this up in a drugstore, mostly because it&#x27;s waterproof.  </li>
      <li>but that one is $24 and its more like a felt tip pen.</li>
      <li>Better than gel eyeliner and is applicated very easily however it isn&#x27;t as precise as liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I was willing to struggle though, in the name of a good gel liner.</li>
      <li>Not a complaint from me, it was very easy to use and the colour was bold &amp; beautiful.</li>
      <li>I find this eyeliner easy to apply and it stays on my eyes all day.</li>
      <li>This is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The shape of the pot doesn&#x27;t allow for easy retrieval with brush.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Revlon Colorstay Creme is easy to apply, lasts all day and removes easily with an oil-free eye make-up remover.</li>
      <li>It also dries out easily eventhough</li>
      <li>smooth and creamy just like a gel eyeliner should.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s goes on really smooth.</li>
      <li>I like that the applicator fits right into the top</li>
      <li>guess the packaging is good, especially if you intend to take this in your purse or whatever.</li>
      <li>The black is a great strong, bold color.</li>
      <li>This product us very user friendly, goes on great and lasts a long time!</li>
      <li>I find it easy to do my normal cats eye flick</li>
      <li>As a big fan of gel eyeliners I was really excited to try this one, particularly given the handy dandy liner brush stored in the lid.</li>
      <li>pros are much worth the one small con, a great product to try and might be my permanent gel liner.​</li>
      <li>first it failed the hand swatch test, it isn&#x27;t great on that type of skin, but gladly that isn&#x27;t what it is made for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The regular Revlon liquid liner is much better.</li>
      <li>I am VERY HAPPY and will NOT buy expensive liners ever again.</li>
      <li>First, this product is described on the packaging as a \\&quot;creme gel\\&quot; eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty much an expert at putting it on and keeping it straight.</li>
      <li>Very few have a decent formula, with a good brush/applicator at a reasonable price, but this takes the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>THANKS REVLON.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this one.</li>
      <li>and I really like the Revlon gel eyeliner</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just trying to use it up as fast as I can</li>
      <li>The consistency of said \\&quot;creme\\&quot; is much closer to a paste.  </li>
      <li>I really like it and its neat</li>
      <li>I really hope Revlon doesn&#x27;t discontinue it anytime soon</li>
      <li>I would really give it zero stars if I could.</li>
      <li>the brush is better than what comes with other brand.  </li>
      <li>the enclosed brush, it keeps it clean and not required to carry an extra brush</li>
      <li>Even brand new, this liner is way too dry to spread easily or evenly.</li>
      <li>You end up with darker and lighter places, thicker and thinner place, and overall just a great big mess.</li>
      <li>A bit light on first application for my taste, but just needs a few touch ups</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have my normal product on here for prime</li>
      <li>and I gave up and threw it out today after 3 weeks of daily use and trying to get this to look right.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s always in a cool dry place.</li>
      <li>, it goes on smoothly and the pigment is quite dark.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>Overall I really like this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s my favourite makeup item so far.</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve noticed it starting to dry out very quickly which makes it even harder to use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It clearly was either not made right to begin with OR was dried out.</li>
      <li>, you are expected to apply the product to your eyes using a small brush that pulls out of the cap which you then invert and insert back into the top of the cap to use.  </li>
      <li>The only other brand that works really well is the one by Blinc...</li>
      <li>Irritates my eyes a little if I mess up and have to clean up/reapply, but if you&#x27;re careful and gentle</li>
      <li>The brush gets stiff even after the first use.</li>
      <li>The problem is the brush is super thick and the product doesn&#x27;t go on the brush evenly.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately the eyeliner pot itself is really difficult to open as the top is too short to get a good grip on; I can&#x27;t imagine how difficult, if not impossible it would be for someone with arthritis to open it.</li>

<li> Thr product is little too thick and wont be easy to apply</li>
<li> I tried the Maybelline brand very similar to this product, but the Revlon one is the one that doesn&#x27;t bleed and stays all day long.  </li>
<li> And it stays on for long time.</li>
<li> Like the other reviewer mentioned, I&#x27;m hoping to prevent someone from making the same mistake I did by purchasing this product.</li>
<li> It was completely dry, and went on cakey and in globs.</li>
<li> Stays on for a long time, even when my face gets wet, and I&#x27;ve been surprised how little smudging I&#x27;ve encountered!</li>
<li> This was a total waste of my money</li>
<li> The other kinds I&#x27;ve used have either smudged or burned my eyes.</li>
<li> but it isn&#x27;t nearly as dark.</li>
<li> It is buildable, meaning you have to do 2-3 coats to get that dark pigment finish.</li>
<li> The color is watered down when you apply.</li>
<li> I bought black, and it was an anemic, almost translucent, dark gray.</li>
<li> Not sure why others say theirs was dry and cakey.</li>
<li> I have had trouble with other products that sweat off, transfer color to my eyelids (even waterproof products).</li>
<li> It was so hard to work with until I modified it myself by mixing some contact fluid in it (remedy for dried mascara).</li>
<li> with Maybelline being about half the cost I decided to try it</li>
<li> I have tried the black and charcoal.</li>
<li> size of the jar is also too small to use an angled brush in, and it&#x27;s hard to get the last bits of liner out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> You use the little brush to pick up some of the eyeliner and then apply it.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the brush end coming off when I applied pressure.&lt;br</li>
<li> but I would expect that to happen with any eyeliner after a few months.</li>
<li> Eyeliner always for me in the past has worn off or by half way through my day</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> my favorite eye liner</li>
    <li> I picked this up in a drugstore, mostly because it&#x27;s waterproof.  It&#x27;s the messiest product I&#x27;ve ever attempted to use, and it does not go on evenly.  I would really give it zero stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Not a complaint from me, it was very easy to use and the colour was bold &amp; beautiful. I have sensitive eyes and it didn&#x27;t irritate me like L&#x27;oreal, Almay &amp; Mabelline eye liners do. Lasted for quite a while and was a bit difficult to remove with just soap &amp; water. I used some cold creme &amp; that did the trick. I really hope Revlon doesn&#x27;t discontinue it anytime soon, it&#x27;s my favourite makeup item so far.</li>
    <li> (I share this account, I&#x27;m a girl) A bit light on first application for my taste, but just needs a few touch ups and you&#x27;re good to go! Irritates my eyes a little if I mess up and have to clean up/reapply, but if you&#x27;re careful and gentle then it works just great. Stays on for a long time, even when my face gets wet, and I&#x27;ve been surprised how little smudging I&#x27;ve encountered! Great value for the money, and wonderful for someone like me who travels often and needs an easy-to-use, quick, portable make-up solution!</li>
    <li> I love that it stays on my eyes, in place all day. I have had trouble with other products that sweat off, transfer color to my eyelids (even waterproof products). This is easy to apply.  Looks great. I have tried the black and charcoal.</li>
    <li> It is buildable, meaning you have to do 2-3 coats to get that dark pigment finish. It also dries out easily eventhough it&#x27;s always in a cool dry place. I don&#x27;t quite like the brush and the mechanism. The brush gets stiff even after the first use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s goes on really smooth. And it stays on for long time. I really like it and its neat that it comes with a brush.</li>
    <li> As a big fan of gel eyeliners I was really excited to try this one, particularly given the handy dandy liner brush stored in the lid. Unfortunately the eyeliner pot itself is really difficult to open as the top is too short to get a good grip on; I can&#x27;t imagine how difficult, if not impossible it would be for someone with arthritis to open it. I was willing to struggle though, in the name of a good gel liner. Alas,  this was not one. I bought black, and it was an anemic, almost translucent, dark gray. I am going to stick with L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s wonderful HIP gel liner (although I don&#x27;t like the brush that comes with it).</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve written a review for a product I did not buy directly off Amazon, but it is SO AWFUL I am determined to spread the word so others don&#x27;t waste their money on this worthless product.  First, this product is described on the packaging as a \\&quot;creme gel\\&quot; eyeliner.  It is neither.  The consistency of said \\&quot;creme\\&quot; is much closer to a paste.  Imagine trying to draw your eyeliner with paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, you are expected to apply the product to your eyes using a small brush that pulls out of the cap which you then invert and insert back into the top of the cap to use.  Not only is it totally impossible to get this to apply evenly on your eyelid with a brush, but it is also impossible to get anything other than a thick line because the product is thick as paste.  Trying to apply it to the lower lid is nothing but a joke and you&#x27;ll look like one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have stuck with the Revlon Colorstay Liquid Liner which is the best eyeliner out there in my opinion. This was a total waste of my money and I gave up and threw it out today after 3 weeks of daily use and trying to get this to look right. It never did.</li>
    <li> Better than gel eyeliner and is applicated very easily however it isn&#x27;t as precise as liquid eyeliner. The brush is a brilliant applicator</li>
    <li> It is the best liner I ever have had.</li>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner after the Bodyshop ran out of usual eyeliner and I really like the Revlon gel eyeliner, it goes on smoothly and the pigment is quite dark. I find it easy to do my normal cats eye flick and it stays in place all day with no smudging. After a couple if months it did start to become cakey and thick but I would expect that to happen with any eyeliner after a few months. Overall I really like this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I have used a number of gel and liquid eyeliners. Very few have a decent formula, with a good brush/applicator at a reasonable price, but this takes the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it failed the hand swatch test, it isn&#x27;t great on that type of skin, but gladly that isn&#x27;t what it is made for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Good brush&lt;br /&gt;Good formula&lt;br /&gt;Afordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the pot doesn&#x27;t allow for easy retrieval with brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are much worth the one small con, a great product to try and might be my permanent gel liner.​</li>
    <li> I bought this liner hoping it would not make me look like a racoon. I bought expensive gel liners from department stores and they ran, faded and made me look like a clown. When I bought REVLON&#x27;s CREME COLORSTAY EYELINER It was on sale, I tried it and it stayed in place all day even in 100 degree farenheit weather. I am VERY HAPPY and will NOT buy expensive liners ever again. THANKS REVLON.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands of eye gel, and haven&#x27;t found any I like as well as the Revlon Colorstay Creme Eyeliner. The other kinds I&#x27;ve used have either smudged or burned my eyes. The Revlon Colorstay Creme is easy to apply, lasts all day and removes easily with an oil-free eye make-up remover.</li>
    <li> This product us very user friendly, goes on great and lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Good price, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is excellent. stays on throughout the day and so smudging.&lt;br /&gt;love the enclosed brush, it keeps it clean and not required to carry an extra brush is the best part</li>
    <li> I really liked Revlon&#x27;s liquid eyeliner, then I started getting into gel liners. I really didn&#x27;t like this one. Even brand new, this liner is way too dry to spread easily or evenly. The pigment is good, I guess, and it&#x27;s matte. It was so hard to work with until I modified it myself by mixing some contact fluid in it (remedy for dried mascara). Now it spreads alright, but still sometimes clumps.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the jar is also too small to use an angled brush in, and it&#x27;s hard to get the last bits of liner out.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the packaging is good, especially if you intend to take this in your purse or whatever. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the brush end coming off when I applied pressure.&lt;br /&gt;Still, this only worked when I changed it myself. Not a good product in and of itself. I&#x27;m just trying to use it up as fast as I can so I can get something better.</li>
    <li> Everything ok as announced. I recommend</li>
    <li> I find this eyeliner easy to apply and it stays on my eyes all day. I love it and I have tried all different kinds. It&#x27;s not like the liquid liners I usually make a mess with. It is thick. Also if it gets in my eye it doesn&#x27;t burn like some liners. I love it.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it took a while to learn how to apply it properly. There is a learning curve for those of use to using a pencil.</li>
    <li> You dont relize how small itll be till u get it. Thenits not waterproof and likes to crease.</li>
    <li> Eyeliner always for me in the past has worn off or by half way through my day gives me that god awful raccoon look, because I have extremely oily skin.  I tried the Maybelline brand very similar to this product, but the Revlon one is the one that doesn&#x27;t bleed and stays all day long.  I am probably going to stock up because products often change or get discontinued.  The only other brand that works really well is the one by Blinc...but that one is $24 and its more like a felt tip pen.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewer mentioned, I&#x27;m hoping to prevent someone from making the same mistake I did by purchasing this product. It was completely dry, and went on cakey and in globs. It clearly was either not made right to begin with OR was dried out. Either way I contacted Revlon and received a refund. I did my research now (needing a replacement), and found great reviews for both M.A.C. and Maybelline gel liners- with Maybelline being about half the cost I decided to try it and it works wonderfully- smooth and creamy just like a gel eyeliner should.</li>
    <li> The brush is good, but the product is not,  I use the brush with a competitor creme eyeliner bc the brush is better than what comes with other brand.  The color is watered down when you apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn liquid eyeliner for 15+ years. I&#x27;m pretty much an expert at putting it on and keeping it straight. I bought this product because the price was good and I&#x27;m an amazon prime member. They don&#x27;t have my normal product on here for prime so I tried something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is more of a.....paste than a liquid. You use the little brush to pick up some of the eyeliner and then apply it. The problem is the brush is super thick and the product doesn&#x27;t go on the brush evenly. You end up with darker and lighter places, thicker and thinner place, and overall just a great big mess. And I&#x27;ve noticed it starting to dry out very quickly which makes it even harder to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan at all. The regular Revlon liquid liner is much better. You&#x27;ll just have to buy it somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Thr product is little too thick and wont be easy to apply</li>
    <li> Not sure why others say theirs was dry and cakey. I LOVE this stuff. I tried to use a cheaper brand and it smeared within 5 minutes. I have oily skin so I need something that lasts! This gel liner goes on very smooth, evenly, and stays on all day. I like that the applicator fits right into the top so you only have to carry 1 item. The black is a great strong, bold color. I have the purple as well but it isn&#x27;t nearly as dark.</li>
