      <li>/&gt;Some say Cetyl Alcohol is safe</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels so healthy.</li>
      <li>I guess these products are meant to be used with others in the Keratin line - I wish there were more explicit instructions -</li>
      <li>and therefore, it ends up costing more.</li>
      <li>afterwards I have shiny, healthy looking hair.</li>
      <li>, hair felt and looked significantly more damaged</li>
      <li>so I just bought more.</li>
      <li>On top of that my hair felt more attached to my scalp if that makes any sense.</li>
      <li>I figured I&#x27;d use the Pantene before I bought more.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
      <li>and my hair is so much more manageable.</li>
      <li>The conditioner just makes it *that much better.</li>
      <li>The more lather you get, the poorer quality the shampoo.</li>
      <li>i love the keratin treatments but not the damage to my hair or the flatness.</li>
      <li>Most shampoos will leave me looking either frizzy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>i was able to iron it without frying the ends.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a great chance that I&#x27;ve found my new go-to shampoo with this product!</li>
      <li>Especially important for older women, as well as for men of any age who are experiencing some hair thinning problems.</li>
      <li>I gave them 3 stars because they do not test on animals, and they were a pretty good deal.</li>
      <li>That is a pretty good reduction in waviness and curls.</li>
      <li>Leave my hair very silky, great scent, clean my hair so well, BUT</li>
      <li>Soft, happy hair that I get compliments on all the time when I use</li>
      <li>Wow, let me just say that it smells great</li>
      <li>When purchasing a sulfatefree shampoo, pelase also make sure if free of all alcohol types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Shampoo arrived on time as expected and I am very happy.  </li>
      <li>However, my one problem with it is that it doesn&#x27;t lather easily.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need this for straightening but the proteins leave my fine hair strong and shiny.</li>
      <li>I wanted tone down the volume in my hair so this product was perfect for me.   </li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair, colored, and prone to breakage.  </li>
      <li>The Coconut Shampoo and Conditioner is also hydrating and worked fine too.</li>
      <li>I have fine, oily scalp.</li>
      <li>HUGE MISTAKE.</li>
      <li>but this thing DE- tangled and moisturized my hair while leaving it smelling fresh:)</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner smell fantastic.</li>
      <li>The shampoo also smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>light fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a light brown sugar gel consistency  </li>
      <li>but I believe this may have been one of the primary causes for dryness, split ends damage.</li>
      <li>And it is sulfer free.</li>
      <li>a first!!</li>
      <li>I have trouble with fragrances, but this is very pleasant.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this shampoo at my daughter&#x27;s house and liked it.  I have trouble with fragrances, but this is very pleasant.  I also stopped using VO 5 because it&#x27;s not needed.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT LATHER UP AT ALL. HARD TO TELL IF IT IS EVEN IN YOUR HAIR.  ONE CHECK BECAUSE IT SMELLS OK.</li>
    <li> I have thick and very wavy/verging on curly hair. After using the Coconut Milk shampoo and conditioner of this brand and not having good results, I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this one. But I love it, it still has a coconutty smell that I&#x27;m obsessed with and it makes my hair soft and silky. I love it and definitely recommend it to others to use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner smell fantastic. And that&#x27;s where the good stuff ends. The shampoo is sooo heavy, I have super thick hair and even the smallest amount of shampoo leaves my hair very heavy.  Plus it has sulfates- bad shampoo, bad!</li>
    <li> This stuff really gets the waves out! It is a nice way to straighten out the waves that was missed by my relaxer without over processing my hair.  It changes the texture and it straightens well enough that I do not have to flat my hair after using this product.  Definitely keeping this line of products around.  Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair that is horribly frizzy. Nothing I have ever tried has work on my hair. EVER. I have only used this shampoo and conditioner once but I already love it! I bought it because I was told to use keratin, then after reading all these reviews I realize it&#x27;s not tested on animals which I absolutly love! And it is sulfer free. I see some people say it wasn&#x27;t lathery enough but I didn&#x27;t even notice a difference :D</li>
    <li> This review is for the Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using sulfate-free hair products for years, and this is by far my least favorite. My hair is normal to oily, and this shampoo makes it super dry, additionally making it more prone to frizz, and definitely not improving smoothness. I don&#x27;t doubt the ingredients are high quality and I salute their ethical testing, but it simply doesn&#x27;t deliver, especially when compared to similar products (even cheaper ones like Loreal&#x27;s EverSleek). I would give it another half star for the great smell, though it actually only lasts while you are washing.</li>
    <li> Bought this Organix Brazilian Keratin Therapy Shampoo just over 2 weeks ago and I have to admit that I&#x27;m very impressed.  Most sulfate-free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have left something to be desired (the exception was Purology, purple bottle).  I have baby fine hair, colored, and prone to breakage.  Most shampoos will leave me looking either frizzy or greasy.  This shampoo has made my hair look distinctly healthier, far less frizz than usual.  It lathers very well for a sulfate-free shampoo and it imparts moisture without making my hair limp or greasy looking.  My hair hangs better, has less fly-aways, but still possesses body.  A perfect combination for me.  I have since purchased the flat-iron spray, it&#x27;s OK - but I&#x27;m not blown away.  I want to try the anti-brakage serum next &amp; will post an update.</li>
    <li> I went out and bought the conditioner also.   I love the way my hair feels after I wash it with this product. It has an elasticity that feels great. I also have the styling oil that can be used if your hair is wet or dry.   This brand has a line of products that are beyond awesome. Same style bottle, same shampoo/conditioner and styling stuff. Excellent.   I wish they would make a small sampler case. I&#x27;m so tempted by the Morrocan Argan Oil line.   The best part - NO SULFATES.</li>
    <li> I have been using the blue version of this shampoo and conditioner for over a month now and just yesterday I noticed I have a very dry scalp. I have never seen my scalp as such. I don&#x27;t have the relevant knowledge in science or chemistry to understand which shampoos and conditioners are best for what kind of hair but I assumed, based of what what written, that it was \\&quot;rich in nutrients.\\&quot; Guess I was wrong. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different with my hair, but scalp dryness is no good.</li>
    <li> i love the keratin treatments but not the damage to my hair or the flatness. one use and my hair is smooth, shiny! soft and manageable. i was able to iron it without frying the ends. i want smooth, shiny,straight hair with body (not flat) and not frizz and this gave it to me in one shampoo. a first!! i used the conditioner too. will be picking up the flat iron spray and split end mending serum :) and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> It is a good one and good price.. the reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it is not fabulous, it is just good.  I tried different kinds of these Keratin products.. this one is not the best ever but it is good, it is  the best you can get with this price. I also like its coconut scent, it is really nice</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s confusing how the Organix shampoos are set up as a group on this page, not individually. It makes it very confusing when reading reviews are people are not specifying which items they bought. This review is for the Organix Keratin shampoo and conditioner. My hair is pretty straight to begin with, but it has some waves in the back, plus it has a slight frizzy cast that gets worse in humid weather. I guess these products are meant to be used with others in the Keratin line - I wish there were more explicit instructions - because I&#x27;ve used both of these (shampoo and cond.) twice, and they&#x27;ve really done nothing. I&#x27;m giving it an average review b/c maybe I should use them longer (?).  I find them to be very drying, and my hair seems straighter when wet, but after drying, I noticed no change at all (except noticeably drier hair). I also do think they&#x27;re lightening. People commented on this with the smoothing treatment, which I haven&#x27;t used. I didn&#x27;t think these 2 alone would lighten, but I think my hair is definitely a bit lighter in color. I don&#x27;t use chemical hair color. I henna. I think it has removed some of the henna (reddish brown color) which is startling as henna is permanent.  All in all, I&#x27;m not happy. I gave them 3 stars because they do not test on animals, and they were a pretty good deal. I notice the straightening power in the wash, but, like I said, it doesn&#x27;t last, so, perhaps, I should stick with it, and see what happens. I bought them from a different retailer than here, but I&#x27;m reviewing on here as the other retailer is bad about not posting bad reviews.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo. The bad reviews come from uneducated people who don&#x27;t understand the chemistry of a good shampoo. FYI the best quality shampoos will NOT lather up a lot. That is because they do not contain sulfates. The more lather you get, the poorer quality the shampoo. This stuff leaves your hair dry feeling probably because it acidic to match hair&#x27;s natural PH. Shampoos that leave your hair feeling soft when wet are high in alkaline which leaves your hair susceptible to damage. This shampoo makes my hair so wonderfully shiny and strong without any crappy silicones. I absolutely LOVE it! It is good quality shampoo and if you aren&#x27;t used to that it seems strange at first but stay with it and your hair will transform. I don&#x27;t need this for straightening but the proteins leave my fine hair strong and shiny.</li>
    <li> My boifriend recently got this shampoo and also the matching conditioner for me and I used it soon as I got it...im currently transitioning (9 months into it) and I have half curly wavy hair and half relaxed so when I straighten my hair I want it all the same texture, THIS PRODUCT DID EXACTLY THAT,soon after using the shampoo I knew my hair was becoming softer, the curly parts especially and the conditioner left me able to run my fingers thru both textures.after towel drying I applied my fantasia ic straightening serumto blowdry and it waz soo much easier for me to run my round brush thru my hair, after blowdrying I used the Organix FLAT IRON SPRAY which I love in conjunction with my andis flatiron...all in all this product is great and will continue 2 be by bi-weekly regimen for straightening my two-textured hair :)</li>
    <li> I love the whole set. I did the 30 day and have been using this everyday to keep my hair straight and it works really well its been a little over 2 weeks and my hair is so much more manageable. No frizz and best of all my hair is straighter.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE. This shampoo (in conjunction with the matching conditioner) got my hair clean but left it feeling extremely dry and brittle. Usually, only the cheap bargain shampoos make my hair feel like this. It&#x27;s definitely not for women of color.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy shampoo, conditioner, and flat iron spray.  I used these products for several months with a month&#x27;s break in between, because I tried a different brand&#x27;s products.  My hair is long, wavy, and fine naturally...and full of highlights.  I have always had problems with my hair laying flat and breakage.  I try to go for pretty sleek hair (volume at the top and straight at the bottom....layered).    Anyways, I absolutely LOVE the smell of these products, and the smell stays all day long until my next wash.  As far as how the shampoo works:  my hair feels very clean after the use.  I do have to use a little extra conditioner, but I have long hair.  I always use a wide tooth comb while I&#x27;m conditioning my hair in the shower, so I don&#x27;t have any issues with my hair having tangles in it like I have read in other reviews.    I usually blow dry and straighten my hair.  I spray the flat iron spray on my hair after I blow dry it and right before I flat iron it.  My hair turns out GORGEOUS, silky, and shiny...laying sleek and flat with no flyaways every time I use the flat iron spray.  I have never had these results with any other product.  My hair is very picky.  I am personally very happy with these products and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I started using this back in August for the first time. Before that my hair was falling out a little bit day by day. Every time I would run my hands through my hair I would get 3-4 strands each time which I don&#x27;t consider normal. After about a week of using this I noticed my hair stopped shedding so much. I could run my hands through my hair without getting ANY strands back. On top of that my hair felt more attached to my scalp if that makes any sense. When I ran out of this shampoo my hair started falling out again in about 2 weeks so I just bought more.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo and conditioner all the time for the simple fact that it was sulfate and sodium free and is what I am suppose to use because I get keratin treatments.  They RECENTLY started putting both sulfate and sodium in this!!UGH now my hair is totally frizzy! Bummer I would not recommend this product especially if you get keratin treatments. Negative stars, Dont fall for it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this shampoo is actually for Brazalian treated hair.  It has paraben and sulfates.  I threw it away.</li>
    <li> I paid over 6.00 for this shampoo and would not pay a dime for it again. The packaging is very nice, but the product is worse than any I have ever used. This is my first Shampoo or hair product review for that matter, but I was so disappointed, I found it worth my time to warn others. This did not soften my hair at all. The conditioner was awful. Will not purchase again. Do not waste your money. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> I bought shampoo and conditioner and afterwards I couldn&#x27;t even get a brush through my hair. I felt it made me hair dry and made no positive effect on it.</li>
    <li> Smells good and I do believe that my hair is somewhat straighter, or at least less frizzy, after use. However, my one problem with it is that it doesn&#x27;t lather easily. I feel like I have to use a lot to get a good lather and that means I go through it faster and therefore, it ends up costing more. So, for that reason, I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Lathers up nicely being as though there are no sulfates. Leaves hair soft, bouncy and clean. I follow with the coconut conditioner from Organix and blow dry, and my hair has never felt better. My new go-to shampoo</li>
    <li> This really wasn&#x27;t the shampoo for me. I bought this as one of my first &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos, although this really isn&#x27;t all that natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is definitely very strong. It smells like coconut and it reminds me of coconut flavored sunflower seeds (yes that is a thing), maybe its just me. It definitely leaves a nice smell in your hair, even after using a different conditioner (which is what I did)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very thick and is not a clear shampoo, which is what I look for in shampoos. It has a shimmery, silicon type look to it. It creates a thick lather, not one that I like very much, but it cleans fairly well. It seems to be a little heavy on my hair. I had thick, long hair while using this and it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
    <li> It basically does not do anything to your hair ! average shampoo</li>
    <li> First &amp;#34;straightening shampoo&amp;#34; that really worked! I have been battling ugly hair most of my life. Unlike some who have thick, shiny, straight as a pin hair, mine has always had a wave and frizz to it -- which I HATE. No matter how many times I brushed it, it still looked like I didn&#x27;t know the meaning of the word &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34;. Even with a short haircut, I had issues. I tried product after product to get the straight tresses I so desperately wished I had been born with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS product is nothing short of a miracle. Not wanting to put a lot of chemicals in my hair, I was thrilled. You must blow dry your hair completely in order for it to really work. And if your hair starts to get dirty, then the curl and frizz will return. I usually use this every other day, and it has worked well enough for me.</li>
    <li> I have had B.B&#x27;s and this works great in keeping your hair maintained longer. I also use the conditioner and like that as well.</li>
    <li> I adore the Organix line, and they really deliver on their \\&quot;promises.\\&quot;  My color-treated, wavy hair has never looked silkier and sleeker!  I was also impressed to read that they do not test on animals, and that both their packaging and labels are recyclable and/or made of recyclable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for our hair ... good for the earth.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product and after reading the reviews I was skeptical if I would like it.   Some of the more noteworthy comments I read about this product included:  -Didn&#x27;t lather well  -made hair feel like straw  -had to use extra product so hair felt weighted down  -wonderful smell but it doesn&#x27;t stay after dry  Well I have been using this for a week and I have to say I LOVE IT!  I have EXTREMELY thick hair, that frizzes like crazy &amp; I tend to avoid conditioner b/c it leaves my hair oily and dull. (not anymore)  I will say this product is not necessarily for those who want to ADD body to their hair, I don&#x27;t think this will help at all. I wanted tone down the volume in my hair so this product was perfect for me.   I understood that the product wouldn&#x27;t lather like normal shampoos b/c of lack of sulfates so the I was prepared for a less than bubbly experience.  I also understood that I wouldn&#x27;t get that \\&quot;silky-did I forget to rinse out the conditioner??-type feeling\\&quot; that comes from other conditioners.   What I got was more of a \\&quot;squeeky clean\\&quot; type of texture.   I was able to smell the coconut smell faintly...something I&#x27;ve been doing &amp; I&#x27;m not sure if I would recommend for everyone; but after my shower B4 I ringout my hair, I take a small amt of the conditioner **abt the size of a dime** and I work it through my wet hair and then towel dry it, my hair is never weighted down, or oily, &amp; the smell is much stronger - my daughter smelled if from across the room...lol  I will admitt I do still use an additional frizz reducing spray after my hair drys b/c it still does \\&quot;poof\\&quot; alittle, but now I only have to use 1 or 2 pumps instead of the 5 or 6 I used b4... afterwards I have shiny, healthy looking hair. (Oh &amp; I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair, so I&#x27;m not sure how that would affect results)  I am so glad I didn&#x27;t get scared off by the bad experiences...for the price it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Seriously this shampoo works like a clairifying one; It will completely strip your hair of moisture and leave it feeling like straw. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Organix Ever Straight Brazilian Keratin Therapy 13. oz shampoo as well as the matching conditioner. The shampoo does a good job in making my hair feel very clean and getting nice and foamy. However it feels like it dries my hair out a little bit and that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave my hair very soft. The products smell very coconut like but after using this product for 2 weeks just to get my money&#x27;s worth , I wouldn&#x27;t continue buying it.</li>
    <li> I use this product faithfully along with the conditioner. I have gray frizzy hair and these products together keep my hair soft and under control. This product smells great. I love it.</li>
    <li> The Shampoo arrived on time as expected and I am very happy.  I have ordered it before and like the way it makes my hair feel after washing it.  I have ordered this item before and will continue to order it because I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had doubts of getting this product. The price is high for the size of the bottle, but I knew it was a natural product. I used it the first day I bought it, and let me tell you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The scent stays with you alll day and its nice to have when you are having a stressful day at work.&lt;br /&gt;-I could tell me hair felt different after the shower when it was still wet.&lt;br /&gt;-I let it air dry over night and the next morning SHAZAM! Even without using drying or straightening products, my hair was less frizzy, softer, and more relaxed. I couldn&#x27;t believe the differance after just ONE use. I combined this shampoo with the Argan oil Organix conditioner. These two are incredible together. I dont think i will ever use a different product again.</li>
    <li> My hair looks shiny and soft after I put in a leave-in conditioner from another line, but I think that just proves how great the other product is. After using gobs of the conditioner, my hair is still dry and tangles into a rats nest. I use pantene relaxed and natural to rescue it from the damage that has been done. For a product that has fewer harsh chemicals, it is amazing how detrimental it has been. FYI - I had no problems with my hair before trying this line. 30 day treatment is a joke too. The whole line of organix keratin therapy products would be great for a dirty switcheroo prank. It&#x27;s that bad!!!</li>
    <li> * Organix Brazilian Keratin Therapy Shampoo and Conditioner, like all other keratin protein shampoos are good, but you must alternate with other moisturizing shampoos without protein or it will become drying  * I will use may be once per week, then I use my other brands like Matrix Sleek, Biolage Hydramoisture, Fructis Triple Nutrition or Pantene Blonde/Brunette Expressions, or Suave Humectant  * It is a light brown sugar gel consistency  * I also like to change it out and use the Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner that provides the right amount of body or volume  * The Coconut Shampoo and Conditioner is also hydrating and worked fine too.</li>
    <li> I first bought this shampoo because it has keratin and it was on sale. Wow, let me just say that it smells great and it leaves my hair feeling soft. Also, after using the shampoo and conditioned i&#x27;ve noticed much less breakage with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am African-American with relaxed hair. I just purchased the Cocoanut Milk like today and will write a review about it very soon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner, paired with the anti-breakage serum, for about a week now. I have naturally wavy/straight hair, and it&#x27;s normally pretty dry so I use lots of moisturizing treatments. Some reviews say this shampoo has dried their hair out, but I have to disagree, personally. This line has done wonders for my hair! It actually styles much easier now with a flat iron, and the style stays straight all day, which NEVER happens normally. Plus, no frizz! My hair looks and feels so healthy. I&#x27;m impressed. I&#x27;m usually fighting a losing battle with my hair, and I think so far this has been a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the 14 day straight treatment, which was the reason I bought the shampoo/conditioner. Do NOT use the straightening treatment. Such a waste. It makes your hair super greasy and it smells bad. The shampoo, however, makes your hair soft and straight, as promised!</li>
    <li> This review is for the Brazilian Keratin Therapy variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color-treated, waist-length hair, and I have to shampoo it every day because I work out and sweat a lot. I also live in the South, and it&#x27;s humid. So I have a frizz problem. I am still searching for the perfect shampoo and this is the most recent one I tried. I&#x27;m liking it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells wonderful (like coconut) and lathers pretty well. I wish it didn&#x27;t have artificial dyes in it, but they haven&#x27;t been bothering me. The smell doesn&#x27;t stick around for too long (it&#x27;s been an hour since I used this and the conditioner from the same line and the smell is gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that keratin can only come from animal sources so this is not a vegan product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel that this is helping to keep my hair straight (and clean, of course). It&#x27;s not going to take the place of a flat iron, of course. I think of it as one more weapon in my frizz-fighting arsenal. It rinses out without leaving residue and my hair is particularly soft since I started using this. There&#x27;s a great chance that I&#x27;ve found my new go-to shampoo with this product!</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy, curly and frizzy. I used to have straight, silky soft hair until I took the medication Depakote. Depakote made my hair fall out. When my hair grew back in after stopping Depakote the new hair is a darker color, curly, wavy, frizzy, dry and course in texture. I have been on the hunt for products to straighten my hair and provide moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argon Oil helps, but washes out with each washing. It is only good for one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is softer, silkier, smoother and straighter, but not completely straight. There is a little bit of a wave and frizz to it. My hair is puffy / fluffy / sort of frizzy and not laying down smooth and straight. However, 95% of the curl and waviness is gone. That is a pretty good reduction in waviness and curls. This is what happens with only shampoo and conditioner and no other products or a hair straightener applied to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shampoo and condition my hair and then sleep on it the fluffiness / puffiness / frizziness is mostly gone in the morning. So, a shower, allowing hair to dry before bed, sleeping on my hair to flatten it out more and this routine gives me the best result to get straight hair the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For giving me moisture this shampoo and conditioner combo is impressive. My new hair soaks up moisture and is super thirsty. My new hair is extremely dry and course. After one use I could tell the difference. My hair is shiny, soft, silky and feels wonderful. I want to keep touching my hair because it feels so soft like mink. It is wonderful. I am amazed at how fast it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my expectation was that the shampoo and conditioner would make my hair 100% straight and give me back my old hair texture and straightness. It can&#x27;t do that. No one can. No product can. These products are pretty close!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with these products. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Read these reviews and then take them with a grain of salt. This page of reviews are for all different \\&quot;Organix\\&quot; products. I wanted to read up on the Brazilian Keratin Therapy\\&quot; shampoo but I noticed that these reviews are for all different shampoos and Organix items. Look close, but better yet, find a different site that has their reviews sorted out for the item that you&#x27;re researching.</li>
    <li> Cleans and leaves hair  silky.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Keratin treatment..so this is highly recommended...non sulfate shampoo and products.&lt;br /&gt;small amounts again... rinse out completely.</li>
    <li> I spent six years searching for shampoo and conditioner that would be able to handle my hair, the ultra treated town water and the harshness our crazy weather inflicted upon my hair. Six years!! I have tried just about every product out there for hair washing, including salon brands. Organic/natural is not a requirement for me since I have such unruly hair. I just want a product to work. I tried Organix simply because I&#x27;d tried everything else on the shelves. Organix blew the other products away. Soft, happy hair that I get compliments on all the time when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first week of using ogranix coconut milk shampoo and Brazilian keratin therapy conditioner, I didn&#x27;t like it. I had no other choice but to continue using it... and then a miracle happened! For the first time since moving to the coast my hair was silky smooth and the frizz was gone. I&#x27;d certainly give it a chance to work it&#x27;s magic if at first you don&#x27;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Santa put some Patene in my stocking and I ran out of Organix, so I figured I&#x27;d use the Pantene before I bought more. HUGE MISTAKE. My hair has lost it&#x27;s shine, I&#x27;m a poofball frizzy monster and my hair feels coarse. I literally have dreams about buying more Organix (probaly because my hair touches me when I sleep and the texture feels awful). Also, my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to feel as clean for as long. I normally wash my hair every other day and with organix, I could go every third day and not feel like my hair was nasty. I feel like I need to wash twice a day with this Pantene. E[...] So yeah, I&#x27;m ditching the Patene and going back to this stuff because it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus for me is that because of the consistency of the coconut milk shampoo, you get every last bit from the bottle. For the Brazillian, the same is true. No ounce is wasted.</li>
    <li> I just threw my Organix Brazilian Keratin Therapy shampoo and conditioner in the trash. What an absolute waste of money! I would give this negative stars if I could. It made my hair dry and so crazily tangled! I actually had to get back in the shower and use a different conditioner on my hair after not even being able to run a comb through it... and guess what? After I used a different conditioner my hair combed out easily! I NEVER write reviews on anything but I am warning all those potential buyers out there: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It&#x27;s awful!!</li>
    <li> I have soft hair and it usually tangles but this thing DE- tangled and moisturized my hair while leaving it smelling fresh:)</li>
    <li> Dried out my hair, did not leave it straight. I&#x27;ve personally had better results with herbal essence. Highly do not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Great packaging&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to get product from tube, does not overflow out&lt;br /&gt;-Nice light fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Hair was left dry and frizzy&lt;br /&gt;-No smoothing benefits&lt;br /&gt;-After months of use, hair felt and looked significantly more damaged</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair. I have my hair relaxed every 3-4months witha  children&#x27;s relaxer, but in July decided to try Brazilian Keratin because I wanted to go (natural). I didn&#x27;t want to buy and overly expensive shampoo/conditioner set if there was a cheaper sulfate free product. I did some research and discovered organix. on Amazon.com it has some mixed reviews, but mostly positive, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months later, I totally regret my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dried out my hair. I have tons of split ends. My hair is now extremely weak. As I washed in the shower, tons of hair comes out. Over the past month, when combing my hair after a shower so much has fallen out. As of yesterday, I had to cut down almost 2 inches of my hair to match up with patches that have already fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is abolutely terrible. Just yesterday I&#x27;ve begun using Carol&#x27;s Daughter Black Vanilla. Hopefully this will repair the damage. I also plan to get a children&#x27;s relaxer by the end of this weak to tame it. Perhaps that would prevent the bale of hay left in my drainage after I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please consider the ingredients when buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (DI water), Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate,&lt;br /&gt;Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine&lt;br /&gt;Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Parfum, Glycol Distearate,&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone Copolyol, Cetyl Alcohol,Cocamide DEA&lt;br /&gt;Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Polyquatemium-11, DMDM Hydantoin&lt;br /&gt;Silk Amino Acids, Panthenol, Melaleuca Altemifolia&lt;br /&gt;(Tea Tree) Leaf Oil, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, Glycine Soja&lt;br /&gt;(Soybean) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) OIl,&lt;br /&gt;Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Tocopheryl&lt;br /&gt;Acetate (Vitamin E), Limonene, Citronellol, CI19140 (Yellow 5)&lt;br /&gt;CI 42090 (Blue 1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say Cetyl Alcohol is safe but I believe this may have been one of the primary causes for dryness, split ends damage. When purchasing a sulfatefree shampoo, pelase also make sure if free of all alcohol types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are maybe one or two positive:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does LATHER.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does smell good&lt;br /&gt;but these arent god enough reasons to sacrafice your hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It does wonders for my hair and the smell is like a day at the spa!!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. Leave my hair very silky, great scent, clean my hair so well, BUT (maybe is my hair) doesn&#x27;t leave my hair straight! I have serious problem with frizz and for this issue, this shampoo don&#x27;t help so much.</li>
    <li> I used it for my real hair and it dried it out, however it worked wonders for my weave. I suggest to only use it for your extensions.</li>
    <li> https://youtu.be/bMs35QLmOyw</li>
    <li> This  is the shampoo I am have been using for 4 years  allready. and it is wonderfull.</li>
    <li> This shampoo as well as we conditioner smells good and works well lasts a long time too</li>
    <li> All I can say is don&#x27;t waste your money! I have fine, oily scalp. I just say ugh frizz mess and very drying.</li>
    <li> This produce makes your hair thicker, stronger and shinier. Especially important for older women, as well as for men of any age who are experiencing some hair thinning problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Shampoo and matching conditioner for five months now. It leaves my hair super soft and silky, even if you don&#x27;t use the conditioner! The conditioner just makes it *that much better.* The shampoo also smells fantastic. It&#x27;s really hard to describe the smell, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a mix of coconut and honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad part about this product is that the 13 oz. runs out quickly. I definitely recommend getting a larger bottle.</li>
