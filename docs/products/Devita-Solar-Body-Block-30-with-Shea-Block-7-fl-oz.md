      <li>and I used it on my face &amp; it made my face look healthy, nor shiny</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>

      <li>to make more profit?</li>
      <li>I use it personally and now on my two children, as it seems to work best for them too.</li>
      <li>I too used to love this sunscreen</li>
      <li>It was fabulous, going on as a moisturizer and feeling great all day under my makeup with no harsh scents or chemicals.</li>
      <li>Rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a ghost.</li>
      <li>I do sometimes have very mild rosacea</li>
      <li>It actually feels like lotion going on and absorbs beautifully.  </li>
      <li>What was once the best sunscreen on the market now goes on as a flaky mess.</li>
      <li>you had a huge fan club here.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I have a layer of sunscreen on my body and it has zinc which is the most effective ingredient I&#x27;ve found thus far.  </li>
      <li>There is no annoying odor</li>
      <li>It goes on light and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>My choice is the medium light.</li>
      <li>Probably that&#x27;s why some people have break out; too much clean clog the pores.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer because it is natural and blends in easily.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to the chemicals and smell of most sunscreens, but not this one.</li>
      <li>The tradeoff is that it is not waterproof, so it is great for everyday use, but not the beach.</li>
      <li>This moisturizing sunscreen contains no dangerous chemicals and uses a zinc oxide that does not make you look like you&#x27;ve applied war paint.</li>
      <li>I use this as my daily face moisturizer and love that it goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I was looking primarily for a moisturizer that also had a high spf and was natural and/or non toxic and this totally fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>Of course, it&#x27;s very expensive, but it&#x27;s also effective and feels great on the skin.</li>
      <li>Good sun protection for everyday.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>It goes on really smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film, like some mineral sunscreens can do.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>it is so gentle i can use it on my face too.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use too much when I apply this.</li>
      <li>It is not heavy or greasy, so it wins my approval.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I also live in the sunny southwest, so sun blocks are required.</li>
      <li>I bought this product ahead of time for the warm weather and by the time I opened it and realized how bad it was, the time had passed for me to be able to return it</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of sunscreen products and this one is by far my least favorite.</li>
      <li>This one scores really well on Skin Deep (environmental working group&#x27;s product database) as well.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and tried this body lotion.</li>
      <li>Will definitely continue to use this product as my main moisturizer and sunscreen</li>
      <li>last tube I had was definitely not as smooth and easy to apply as the ones I had bought before.</li>
      <li>and this covers it - and helps calm it down.</li>

    <li> Best sunblock/moisturizer ever</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I highly recommend it. See how good it is for you and Environmental Working Group (EWG.ORG). Buy through them and the get a little spiff to help them pay for their research. There is a lot of sunscreen out there that is toxic. This one is not.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen!  I use it personally and now on my two children, as it seems to work best for them too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product many times. It&#x27;s a physical barrier without the nasty harmful chemicals in chemical based sunblock. It goes on skin well without white buildup and can even apply on face without break</li>
    <li> smell like regular sunblock. Keep in mind that you have to re-apply every 1 1/2 hours. Probably that&#x27;s why some people have break out; too much clean clog the pores. So I only use on my arms when I know I&#x27;ll be out for a short time.</li>
    <li> What was once the best sunscreen on the market now goes on as a flaky mess.</li>
    <li> I too used to love this sunscreen and I used it on my face &amp; it made my face look healthy, nor shiny&lt;br /&gt;The last tube I had was definitely not as smooth and easy to apply as the ones I had bought before. I thought I had a dud tube..but can read that others have been disappointed,  Why do companies do this to their customers? to make more profit? to sell out to bigger companies who reduce their quality ingredients? it is such a shame, Shame on your Devita - you had a huge fan club here.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My doctor recommended it due to my sensitive skin. It goes on light and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> It did not disappoint. I have sensitive skin and tried this body lotion. I also live in the sunny southwest, so sun blocks are required. It is not heavy or greasy, so it wins my approval.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;m allergic to topical alcohol, glycols, and a bunch of other ingredients often found in skin products.  This one has nothing harmful to me in it and DOES protect from sunburn.  I use it on my arms every day during the summer.</li>
    <li> I was looking primarily for a moisturizer that also had a high spf and was natural and/or non toxic and this totally fit the bill.  I use it on my hands and arms daily.  It goes on really smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film, like some mineral sunscreens can do.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  This one scores really well on Skin Deep (environmental working group&#x27;s product database) as well.</li>
    <li> Product separates on skin and leaves unabsorbed debris ...it should not do this...either this is bad or faulty product. Cannot be sure of sun protection!</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it sun block lotion.  Not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a white coating on your skin.  This is now my go to lotion.</li>
    <li> i love this sunscreen, zinc is the best you can get, and it is smooth.  it is so gentle i can use it on my face too. great value for your money,  love it, love it, cat</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years. The consistency hasn&#x27;t changed, no formula transformation to surprise me (so often we find the perfect thing and then the manufacturer messes with it). It&#x27;s not oily. I would recommend moist skin when applying for an even finish - or apply regardless. Good coverage. Not heavy and thick like a foundation. I use this in place of foundation. My choice is the medium light. I&#x27;m fair but with some color. I do sometimes have very mild rosacea and this covers it - and helps calm it down. Take the plunge.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I am very sensitive to the chemicals and smell of most sunscreens, but not this one. It is odorless and doesn&#x27;t give me a bad reaction. So happy I found this!!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer because it is natural and blends in easily. I like that I can purchase it locally at several stores as well as online.</li>
    <li> this is the best sunblock i&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
    <li> Leaves white residue.</li>
    <li> This is the best body moisturizer/sunscreen I have ever used.  Goes on like a lotion; does not make skin feel coated and slimy.  Good sun protection for everyday.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re wearing sunblock! Amazing :-)</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer everyday. There is no annoying odor and it goes on very nicely and is not sticky like some sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen but if you rub it on too hard it starts rubbing off and gets flaky.</li>
    <li> Very light and not greasy, unlike most mineral sunscreens. The tradeoff is that it is not waterproof, so it is great for everyday use, but not the beach. And, it received EWG&#x27;s highest rating.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of sunscreen products and this one is by far my least favorite. No matter how hard you try to get this product to apply without flaking up it still does... I tried applying it by rubbing, patting, applying it fast, applying it slow, but sadly with no success. After the fifth attempt i picked up the bottle and threw it in the trash. Long story short do not buy this. You will regret it.</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer! I&#x27;ve noticed clearer skin and an overall smoother complexion since using this. I haven&#x27;t noticed white flakes when this dries like some other reviews, but I do rub it in well and a little goes a long way so I don&#x27;t use too much when I apply this. I use it as a daily moisturizer on my face.</li>
    <li> Works great, I use it as a moisturizer/ SPF for my face. Does not flake or leave any white stuff on.</li>
    <li> Previously, this is the only product I would use. It was fabulous, going on as a moisturizer and feeling great all day under my makeup with no harsh scents or chemicals. Apparently these are not the same Solar Body Block that I had purchased previously and I have read that it was reformulated and the consistency of it is different now, hence the different name of \\&quot;Body Moisturizer\\&quot; rather than \\&quot;Body Block\\&quot;. The bad part is when searching for \\&quot;Body Block\\&quot; you get the \\&quot;Moisturizer\\&quot; results, a little deceiving. This newer formula is horrible. It does not rub into my skin and leaves white stuff everywhere. The consistency is very gritty and not smooth like the previous version. I bought this product ahead of time for the warm weather and by the time I opened it and realized how bad it was, the time had passed for me to be able to return it so now I am stuck with it. I am now on the search for something else. So disappointed in the change in this product. Why take something so good and ruin it?</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Rubs in easily and doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a ghost. Will definitely continue to use this product as my main moisturizer and sunscreen</li>
    <li> There is something very wrong with this product.  It has been reformulated and flakes when applied to the skin.  Both the body and face version suffer from the same flaw.</li>
    <li> This is the only mineral-based sunscreen that my husband and kids will wear WITHOUT complaining about how it feels.  It actually feels like lotion going on and absorbs beautifully.  I use this as my daily face moisturizer and love that it goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer with sun protection. It does not leave any residue and my face does not feel greasy or anything.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing sunscreen contains no dangerous chemicals and uses a zinc oxide that does not make you look like you&#x27;ve applied war paint. Of course, it&#x27;s very expensive, but it&#x27;s also effective and feels great on the skin.</li>
