      <li>Smells great..</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>

      <li>I had just found one I loved</li>

      <li>Great and strong scent !</li>
      <li>wonderful fresh smell.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Amazing deal for those of you that use this deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>and it is still not any better.</li>
      <li>Give more than you take.</li>
      <li>Plant two more in its place.</li>
      <li>Make love to your (wo)man.</li>
      <li>Old Spice did a great job updating their image.</li>
      <li>and I could still smell the scent, strong as ever.</li>
      <li>It has a strong to it</li>
      <li>Bearglove doesn&#x27;t smell like bears (ha), but more like sweet watermelon.</li>
      <li>i love it so much</li>
      <li>It is such a good scent that a stranger standing next to us stopped to tell my boyfriend that he smelled good.  </li>
      <li>I smelled all the other new ones and I decided this one was just the best.</li>
      <li>Luckily, she kept it moving.  </li>
      <li>So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn.</li>
      <li>right.</li>
      <li>My new favorite Old Spice deodorant hope they keep this one around for a while!</li>
      <li>It smelt like a melon bubble gum at first .</li>
      <li>I am a straight guy and my girl loves it!</li>
      <li>I love this sent and my local store stopped carrying it!</li>
      <li>I am not a very stinky guy, but I can put this on and still smell great well over 24hrs later, I guess that could depend on your level of BO or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This scent is clean and fresh, and definitely makes me feel like a man when use it.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>The burning was so intense, that I had to take a shower to get it off.</li>
      <li>My girlfriend really likes the smell as well.</li>
      <li>It smells clean and comforting at the same time.  </li>
      <li>Its seriously the most unique fragrance I have ever smelled as a deodorant.</li>
      <li>But other than that no complaint, I love the scent.</li>
      <li>So this is supposed to be masculine, like wrestle bears and live off the land, because you&#x27;re a real man.</li>
      <li>Not bad but really didn’t last a month of once daily use before the stick started falling apart.</li>
      <li>For years the ONLY deodorant I would use was Old Spice Fresh.</li>
      <li>Thank you Old Spice!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Complaint in general with Old Spice is that they tend to release new scents and retire the old very often.</li>
      <li>, Amazon, got home straight to bed and woke up the next morning before my shower</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve had people walk up to me and say I smell feminine, old spice get yo scents</li>
      <li>I hope that Old Spice does not discontinue the scents I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
      <li>The scent is long lasting and it feels fresh, will buy again</li>
      <li>cheaper than buying at major chain stores.</li>
      <li>If you can get over the hyperbole of Proctor &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Old Spice marketing machine, the scent itself is a modern masculine scent that&#x27;s a solid alternative to Old Spice&#x27;s usual musky lineup.</li>
      <li>If smelling \\&quot;rich and complex as a gilded Rube Goldberg machine\\&quot; means \\&quot;like bergamot, ginger, and spruce\\&quot;, then yes, that is correct.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the entire wild collection, to determine which scents I would like to make a long term commitment to.</li>

<li> I am hoping it actually sticks around long enough for me not to have to find another one anytime soon.</li>
<li> But, if you happen to like the scent, it&#x27;s a long lasting fragrance.</li>
<li> One of my favourites, lasts a long time</li>
<li> It lasts a really long time also.</li>
<li> It lasts a long time too.</li>
<li> My ultimate intent was to move away from antiperspirants, due to their shirt-staining properties.</li>
<li> Great for ladies who don&#x27;t like nasty aluminum.  </li>
<li> Please be careful using this deodorant.</li>
<li> Other Old Spice deodorants have lasted at least a couple of months.</li>
<li> The other island scents are merely average.</li>
<li> Chop down a tree.</li>
<li> This stuff is not for men who are afraid of positive attention.</li>
<li> Smells a little like Jolly Rancher candy to me.  </li>
<li> sooooooo I used this at my boyfriend&#x27;s house one morning when I had forgotten my own deodorant and it gave me a god awful chemical burn under my arms.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
<li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had a violent reaction to a deodorant.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with either scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Smells like Watermelon or another melon sent.  I do not care if it smells fruity. I am a straight guy and my girl loves it!</li>
    <li> The scent is long lasting and it feels fresh, will buy again</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wears it. It smells clean and comforting at the same time.  It is such a good scent that a stranger standing next to us stopped to tell my boyfriend that he smelled good.  Luckily, she kept it moving.  This stuff is not for men who are afraid of positive attention.</li>
    <li> So this is supposed to be masculine, like wrestle bears and live off the land, because you&#x27;re a real man. But I&#x27;ve had people walk up to me and say I smell feminine, old spice get yo scents right. But other than that no complaint, I love the scent.</li>
    <li> One of my favourites, lasts a long time</li>
    <li> My new favorite Old Spice deodorant hope they keep this one around for a while!</li>
    <li> I love this sent and my local store stopped carrying it!</li>
    <li> Smells like CANDY!  Great for ladies who don&#x27;t like nasty aluminum.  And makes men smell tasty, too.  Bear deodorant smells like a jolly rancher, and the fox label smells like lemonade.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good service.</li>
    <li> This scent is clean and fresh, and definitely makes me feel like a man when use it.  If only I had been &amp;#34;smellcomed to manhood&amp;#34; earlier in life...</li>
    <li> sooooooo I used this at my boyfriend&#x27;s house one morning when I had forgotten my own deodorant and it gave me a god awful chemical burn under my arms. Not a rash, a burn! Please be careful using this deodorant. It has been almost a week and it is still not any better.</li>
    <li> Best smelling deodorant I&#x27;ve ever smelt i love it so much</li>
    <li> despite how hyper-masculine the description is, this scent is not at all musky. it&#x27;s very light and refreshing. i smelled it on someone else and bought it for myself, and i&#x27;m a lady. now, i can&#x27;t stop smelling my armpits.</li>
    <li> A scent that is deceiving. It smelt like a melon bubble gum at first . After 2 hours or so, you smell your pits, the body spray scent of beargloves emerges . If you don&#x27;t know how it smells , try the body spray to know what I am saying. Great and strong scent ! Only scent weakens after 5-6 hours but no odor though!</li>
    <li> Smells great..Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> smells like berry&#x27;s...</li>
    <li> If smelling \\&quot;rich and complex as a gilded Rube Goldberg machine\\&quot; means \\&quot;like bergamot, ginger, and spruce\\&quot;, then yes, that is correct.  If you can get over the hyperbole of Proctor &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Old Spice marketing machine, the scent itself is a modern masculine scent that&#x27;s a solid alternative to Old Spice&#x27;s usual musky lineup.</li>
    <li> Nothing on the package indicates what the scent is going to be like.  Smells a little like Jolly Rancher candy to me.  But, if you happen to like the scent, it&#x27;s a long lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> For years the ONLY deodorant I would use was Old Spice Fresh. I&#x27;m not sure why but I saw this one in Wal-Mart and decided to take a whiff. I smelled all the other new ones and I decided this one was just the best. Now I can&#x27;t, now I WON&#x27;T use another deodorant. My girlfriend really likes the smell as well. It lasts a really long time also. I put it on after I woke up for a 10 hour shift at, ironically, Amazon, got home straight to bed and woke up the next morning before my shower and I could still smell the scent, strong as ever. Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Son likes this a lot and has a good scent.</li>
    <li> Amazing deal for those of you that use this deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper than buying at major chain stores.</li>
    <li> Not bad but really didn’t last a month of once daily use before the stick started falling apart. Other Old Spice deodorants have lasted at least a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I cant stop smelling myself. Its seriously the most unique fragrance I have ever smelled as a deodorant. It lasts a long time too. I put it on when I go to sleep at night just so I can smell myself to sleep. Its awesome.</li>
    <li> The scent is great! But as soon as I put it on, it was searing my flesh.  The burning was so intense, that I had to take a shower to get it off. This is the first time I&#x27;ve had a violent reaction to a deodorant. I purchased the entire wild collection, to determine which scents I would like to make a long term commitment to. So Far, I love hawkridge, and wolfthorn. The other island scents are merely average. My ultimate intent was to move away from antiperspirants, due to their shirt-staining properties. I hope that Old Spice does not discontinue the scents I&#x27;ve discovered.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Its the second scent I try and I like it. It has a strong to it but thats good for working out so that it covers the sweat smell.</li>
    <li> Be a man. Chop down a tree. Plant two more in its place. Give more than you take. Make love to your (wo)man. Be a father to your children. Build a fire. Act with honor. Grow a beard. Buy this product. Smell like a man.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has always called me a bear. Now I smell like one. A gentlemanly one. A gentlebear. Thank you Old Spice!</li>
    <li> Bearglove doesn&#x27;t smell like bears (ha), but more like sweet watermelon. Hawkridge is also recommended, smelling like Nag Champa incense. Old Spice did a great job updating their image. Both scents smell great and have long-lasting sillage, longer than the body wash versions IMO. You can&#x27;t go wrong with either scent.</li>
    <li> Excellent deodorant, I choose not to wear anything else but this. This one keeps me taken care of all day, smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause excess itching or anything like that. I am not a very stinky guy, but I can put this on and still smell great well over 24hrs later, I guess that could depend on your level of BO or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complaint in general with Old Spice is that they tend to release new scents and retire the old very often. I had just found one I loved and then everybody stopped carrying it, which in turn pointed me to this one. I am hoping it actually sticks around long enough for me not to have to find another one anytime soon.</li>
    <li> wonderful fresh smell.</li>
    <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve worn this, my chest hair is thicker and I have beat back the women with a stick.</li>
