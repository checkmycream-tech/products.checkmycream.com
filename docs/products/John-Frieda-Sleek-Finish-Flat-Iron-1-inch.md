<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this flat iron.</li>
    <li> I just picked this up at a drugstore because I left home without mine (Paul Mitchell with little gripper edges).  The packaging looks pretty upscale for a drugstore and it says it has ceramic/titanium plates which appear to be substandard when compared to real ceramic plates. Despite this, it works (I have medium curly, medium course hair that is chemically treated). The &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe they put this on the market&amp;#34; moment was when I tried to use it and immediately changed the temperature. It is extremely difficult to use without turning it off or changing the temperature because the controls run along one thin bar the length of the handle (it looks great, just doesn&#x27;t work well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one question for the person/persons/Company that designed this product...did ANYONE use it before you put it on the market? I bet not.</li>
    <li> The plates aren&#x27;t close enough for my hair.  It literally glides through my hair and not in a good way.  I even went ahead to grab the top portion while i passed it through my hair and nope still would slide through.  Increased the temp to the max which I believe is 455 and still did nothing for my hair.  I bought this a the recommendation of a friend because she said she loved it but for me not at all.  The hunt for a flat iron continues....</li>
    <li> this iron is completely ridiculous.  They put the on/off switch and temperature control RIGHT ON THE HANDLE where you HOLD the iron!  you turn it off 10x or change the temperature 10x before you realize the only way to deal with it is to hold it at the top - YES by the hot plates!  It&#x27;s completely ridiculous it&#x27;s like no one ever tested it.  It&#x27;s sleek and has great design but it&#x27;s crap for functionality.  Also it&#x27;s too light - doesn&#x27;t straighten well enough for my particular taste but that&#x27;s nothing to the idiotic design.  I should have just bought another CHI. Ugh!</li>
    <li> I have been waiting to review this so I could see how much the buttons bother me.  After a few months of using, I find myself looking for a new product. It works fine, but the positioning of the buttons is so frustrating. I have found this the same for a revlon curling iron that I have.  I find myself looking for a new product in the stores. I would definitely choose a different model, although I think there are enough features that are excellent with this one that I could definitely recommend the brand.</li>
    <li> The other reviewers are right about the buttons being poorly placed. I like this iron because it does straighten the hair well..when you can get the temperature to remain constant. The buttons are on the thin strip along the top so it takes a while to learn to use this iron without constantly changing the temperature or even shutting it off completely. Once you get the hang of it the iron works well...but it takes some awkward hand positioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other issue is that there are no lights on this digital iron. I have bought cheaper irons that at least light up to let you know when they are ready!!!! Another thing is that the bottom of this iron is very curved so it tends to roll and fall over when placed on the counter. You have to really make sure that the &#x27;legs&#x27; are not on the edge of your counter or the iron will fall over constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hear the slight buzzing that other reviewers mentioned and it is not loud enough to be alarming..it is just weird because none of my other irons ever did this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally an ok iron but it would not be my main one and I think I will purchase another Remington as that works better for me.</li>
    <li> This straightener has a nice sleek design and looks like a quality device.  The heat plates are titanium ceramic coated and measure about 4 1/2\\&quot; x 1\\&quot;.  They should be easy to clean.  The manual states it has an ionizing function that neutralizes the generally positive charge on flyaway, frizzy hair, eliminates static electricity, and contributes to shine.  It comes with a heat mat to rest the straightener on.  The point where the power cord attaches to the straightener swivels, so that should greatly reduce twisting and tangling of the power cord.    My girlfriend used this on her curly brown hair and it worked quite well.   It has a digital temperature display that can be set from 275 to 455 degrees F.  It heats up quickly and the temperature number flashes until the desired temperature is reached.  The highest setting is suggested for thicker and/or harder to style hair.  Lower temperatures are for thinner hair.  She didn&#x27;t need to use any other styling products (hair lotions, etc) to get her hair straight.    This straightener comes with a 5 year warranty.    The only negative she reported is the controls for the temperature are in the way when holding and using the product.  Often her thumb would accidentally hit the button to increase the temperature.</li>
    <li> The unit heats up very quickly and very neat to use as a hair straightener.  The only issue which my wife complained about was that it was very difficult to see and operate the controls when the unit is on.</li>
    <li> Review from my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of straighteners and this one is pretty good. It heats up fairly quickly and my hair is super smooth and soft when I&#x27;m finished straightening it! It cools down fairly quickly which I can appreciate because I want to put my straightener away after I use it but if it hasn&#x27;t cooled down enough by the time I have to leave for work, I leave it on the counter, which drives my husband nuts :-)&lt;br /&gt;As for the design, I&#x27;m a little surprised. The look of the straightener is nice and sleek, and is lightweight. However, the buttons on the top of the straightener cause a lot of frustration!! They are placed right where I put my fingers when I straighten my hair!! I find myself turning it off or changing the heat settings without even knowing it. Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;Side note - heat controls are based on temperature rather than low, medium, and high which I like.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the straightener is nice but not worth $50.</li>
    <li> I have an unruly wave/curl to my hair that likes to go a bit crazy the more humid it gets. I mostly ignore it or use one of a supply of cute headbands to suppress it but sometimes even that doesn&#x27;t work and I, who am the most impatient of hairstylers, have to pull out the flat iron. This one was so stylishly flashy with the way the temperature and buttons are designed! It heats up exceptionally fast, even to my impatient way of thinking, and cools down just as fast for storage quick in the mornings. And in about a minute of styling time my hair is tamed in to straight sanity. And the best part is it stays that way!  Update: I did take one star away because the more I use this straightener the more I find that the buttons are positioned so that I keep accidentally pushing the off button while I&#x27;m doing my hair and then I of course lose heat because the device is off. It might just be me, but I thought I should include it in my review as an f.y.i.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read these comments before buying. This iron looks cool, and does a great job..until..you turn it off accidentally, change the temp, or burn your hand trying to stay away from the controls! Horrible design placement. I should have returned it after the first few days, but kept thinking it was me. It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s the flat iron. Hire a new design engineer, John Frieda!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product that heats up super fast! When they say 15 seconds, they aren&#x27;t joking! I have straight hair already and use this product for undercurls or body waves. The hot plates are very smooth and slide down your hair easily (unlike off-brands). I only had to go over the area once instead of 5-6 times with an off-brand straightener. It&#x27;s digital and you can choose the temperature for your hair type. It has a pleasing, sleek design and comes with a cooling mat - which is a nice feature. The auto-shut off is reassuring so I don&#x27;t have to worry that I left it on and the house might burn down. This is my first try with a John Frieda product and I will try others because this worked so well!</li>
    <li> My daughter and wife tried this straightener and found it to be good but not great.  It is not as wide as their old one, so they had to put less of their hair in it on each pass, meaning it takes much longer to finish.  Oddly enough, the company touts that it heats up faster, making the process easier.  But, when you have to do less hair per pass, the time it takes to heat up is inconsequential.  Other than that, it is nice looking and built fairly sturdy.  While doing a decent job of straightening, the fact that it takes much longer comes into play on many a morning.  While the price seems a little high right now, depending on how long it lasts may make it more of a value.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I just recently got this hair straightener, and I love it! My CHI just broke, and I thought it was time for a cheaper one... this does the trick!  Please keep in mind that I have wavy hair, and even my CHI straigtener is not comparable to this one! Im going to write a short summary, but is detailed too.   Pros:  - heats up super fast!  -smooths frizz and fly aways (even my CHI didn&#x27;t do this!)  -Super great quality, and made out of metal.   -So many heat settings, for people who need a lot of heat and those who don&#x27;t  -Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair/rip it out  -smooth plates  -easy to curl hair, as the metal is round!       Cons:  -not exactly \\&quot;light weight\\&quot;  -buttons are right next to where I hold my hand (my hand sometimes clicks different settings by accident)  In other words, YES BUY IT. I&#x27;m in love with this straightener, and you will be too!</li>
    <li> The product itself works well but the button to change the temperature is right under my thumb so I constantly change it or burn myself trying to avoid the button.</li>
    <li> This may be a perfectly good straightner, but the design is terrible.  They have the switch to make it hotter or cooler right on the front of the handle where you hold it, so every time you put it up to your head to use, you change the temperature setting and you don&#x27;t know it.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Very poorly designed.  I really can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s a good straightner or not because I had the toughest time just \\&quot;TRYING\\&quot; to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair every day for more years than I can remember. Straighteners are amazing. I love them. They work wonders on my hair. I have very thick hair. After I blow dry my hair \\&quot;straight\\&quot;, it&#x27;s full, wavy and frizzy. When I don&#x27;t blow it dry, it looks something like Roseanne-Roseanna-Danna of Saturday Night Live fame. That is to say, my hair is curly, frizzy and BIG. In my opinion, a good straightening iron should be able to straighten and smooth my hair from either it&#x27;s blown dry or air dried state. This straightener was able to do that...but with difficulty.    The difficulty was not in the straightening itself. The parts of my hair I was able to straightened turned out great. The problem with this straightener is 100% in the design.  The design is terrible! The on/off button and the up/down heat buttons are right where you need to place your hand to hold the straightener. I lost count of the number of times I either turned the heat down accidentally or even turned the whole thing off altogether! I could feel my fingers, hand, thumb (whichever) pushing down on the buttons but there was nothing I could do to stop it. I readjusted my hands in every possible position to find a way to hold the thing without some part of my hand eventually hitting those buttons. I was starting to get cramps in my hand just trying to manipulate the thing.  I managed to straighten my hair with my thumb grabbing between the two sets of buttons but it was a very awkward way to hold it, making it very difficult to work on my hair safely and efficiently. And even then I kept bumping into the buttons and accidentally turning down the heat or turning off the unit. When I tried to use the straightener on my daughter I had to give up. The angle which I needed to hold it to straighten someone else&#x27;s hair was not compatible with how my hand had to grib the straightener so as to not hit the buttons. It was a disaster.    The straightener I currently use has a slide on/off switchand a dial to adjust the heat and it&#x27;s way at the bottom of the iron. The buttons on this unit are spread out across the bottom of the unit in such a way as to make it impossible to grip.    Otherwise, the unit is light and works well. If they redesign it and change the type of buttons so you can&#x27;t accidentally hit them, it would be a good straightener. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s too frustrating and uncomfortable to use the way it is now.</li>
    <li> When I first got it out of the box I thought it was going to be great. Turned it on and it heated up super fast.. THEN i started to style my hair..  It seemed like it was taking forever to straighten. Finally i looked down and somehow i turned the temp ALL the way down. What were they thinking? Yeah the 15 second heat up is wonderful, but who has time to keep turning the temp up or down?? NOT ME. Soo its going back to the store and i&#x27;ll spend my $40 on something i dont have to fight with.</li>
    <li> After my first straightener took a bomb I broke down and bought a very expensive Amika straightener; it costs around 150$. I hated it, hated it, hated it. Thanks to the Amika straightener, I had to cut off over 5 inches of my hair because it burnt it so badly. The company was not helpful either. I purchased the John Freida straightener, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it. I can straighten my hair or put curls in it, just like the more expensive straighener I bought. Yes, the buttons can be a pain in the butt, but overall the product is good quality and works well on my non-compliant hair. Even better, my hair isn&#x27;t getting burned constantly with every day use of the product. Would reccomend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I read a good amount of these reviews before making this purchase. Almost didn&#x27;t buy it just because of the reviews stating that the button placement is poor. BUT I took a chance and bought it anyway, and I love it! By far the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The plates are very close together.&lt;br /&gt;2. Although it is powerful and hot, the heat is dispersed properly so it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair or fingers when I touch a recently straightened section.&lt;br /&gt;3. Does NOT pull out single strands of hair. In my experience many straighteners have slits where hair can get stuck when gliding the iron through. These plates are sleek and flush with the wand so it doesn&#x27;t tug out any hair!&lt;br /&gt;4. Completely gets rid of frizz and does a pretty good job at eliminating static. This is a huge deal for me since I have thick, frizzy, staticy strands of hair. Even tamed my baby hairs!&lt;br /&gt;4. The placement of the on/off switch isn&#x27;t a problem for me. I never accidentally turn the iron off in the middle of straightening. My fingers are curved around the buttons, so I would have to push down with the inside of my knuckle to change a setting. Maybe I don&#x27;t hold it normally...who knows!</li>
    <li> This straightener says says it goes to 455 degrees but it don&#x27;t feel like it. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the button settings but it don&#x27;t straighten my hair right it still leaves my hair wavy...so don&#x27;t be fooled..</li>
    <li> This product works great! It heats quickly and evenly. It doesn&#x27;t drag across my hair either. It slides easily and gently, I have had problems with straighteners not going smoothly over my hair because I have wavy thick hair but this one causes no difficuties to use.     Pros:  Heats quickly   Has multiple heat temperatures  Heats evenly!!  Slides across hair gently    Cons:  Doesn&#x27;t lock in closed positon for storage</li>
    <li> The design is terrible, I have no idea why they would make a design like that. It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I are used to using a Chi flat iron so this brand really can&#x27;t compare. However, it did heat up quickly, got hot, and did a good job on our hair. For a moderately priced flat iron, it  performed remarkably well. Nice and sturdy, also.</li>
    <li> I have been using this iron for years and years.  Every time one dies, I resolve to try something else, and end up going back to this product (grudgingly) because nothing I have tried, regardless of price, has delivered the same excellent results.  But it baffles me how the manufacturer can be so oblivious to an overwhelming amount of negative feedback about the poor design.  It is impossible to use this iron quickly and efficiently without unintentionally turning it off or changing the temp.  It creates a very awkward grip to try to avoid hitting the long button and it is actually easier to get burned.  5 Stars for results, 1 Star for ease of use.</li>
    <li> broke in a week from light use</li>
    <li> I owned a Chi before. I&#x27;ve used this one for about a year. I like the it better than the Chi. I use it to straighten and curl my hair.  It works so well on my frizzy hair.  I&#x27;m now buying one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I am an African-American woman who often has trouble finding hair styling products that heat up hot enough for my hair. Most products start off hot, but I have to keep stopping and waiting for it to reheat. Not this flat iron. I tried it first on my daughter&#x27;s unprocessed hair and it performed beautifully. It was hot enough to tackle our hair but not burn it. I also loved that it was easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think one of my favorite features is the electronic read out. I have an awful habit of leaving my flat irons on because I often can&#x27;t tell whether their on or off. I&#x27;ve burned myself several times thinking that I&#x27;d turned something off but didn&#x27;t. The electronic read out leaves no doubt about whether it&#x27;s powered on or off. It also leaves no doubt on what temperature it&#x27;s on. Put to the test, this product passes!</li>
    <li> Best hands down and its a decent price it does miracle to hair. I have natural hair and when I use it you would think I got a perm or something I HIGHLY recommend it. The shipping is fast I got mines within 3 or 4 days top.</li>
    <li> Heats a lot wich is good to get ready faster but also a risk for my ears and forehead even when I am very careful about not touching the plates and mostly because the outer faces of the plates also reach a really high temperature. However I use it really often and I try to be super careful so i&#x27;s not such a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;The design wich everybody is complaining about is a problem for me too because as I mentioned, the exterior of the plates is so hot that I can even touch them so, the only place safe to hold the flat iron is right over the buttons. But as I already said I use it very often so, in general I like it and for the price (I got a discount) I&#x27;m really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you to know, is really hard to find quality hair tools in Mexico for a reasonable price, this flat iron in the only one place where I could found it, was approximately valued for twice the price in amazon so I bought it, among with the salon shape hot airbrush, full volume hair dryer and the loose curls 1 1/4 inch curling iron for the price of just two of them in my city (shipment included). Real deal, amazon.</li>
    <li> From my wife Sarah: It doesn&#x27;t get much easier than this, and it works. I have very fine, curly/wavy hair. Here&#x27;s what I liked about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s so easy. The directions are simple and written clearly, there&#x27;s not much to know, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It heats up super fast so there&#x27;s very little waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It was comfortable in my hand. I deal with some arthritis and carpal tunnel. The device is very light, and it was easy to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It works! Of course those with very thick or ultra curly hair may need to take into account other reviews as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that as I used it, my hand kept hitting the temperature control button. However that can be avoided by holding the device lower down, below the control button, so it was no real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this device.</li>
    <li> Stop going up to the advertised 455 degrees.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair with weird cowlicks, so a good straightener is a necessity if I want a finished look for my hair.  I have bought super expensive ones that got too hot and were too heavy to handle.  I ended up using a really cheap one because it had a variable heat setting and was lighter, but still didn&#x27;t do what I wanted.  This one made by John Frieda is extraordinary.  It heats up quickly, it is light and easy to handle, and best of all, it straightens your hair but doesn&#x27;t leave it stuck to your head.  Your hair still retains body and really improves the texture.  I am really thrilled with the heat settings which are easily moved up or down by a simple click on the control panel.  It also comes with a heat pad to rest on while in use.  The electrical cord is on a swivel which is important since it makes the iron easy to use to get those really cool curls you see in the magazines.  I wish I had found this one before I bought the super expensive one.  The price on this one gives an excellent value.</li>
    <li> First off, a little background and hair information. I have been (trying to) use straighteners for close to 10 years now. If I had to put myself into a category, I tend to keep my hair in the low maintenance category. Most days, I am lucky if it gets any product or even a blow dry. Seriously, I am a towel dry then brush and out the door kinda girl. Right now, my hair is on the short side due to all the waves. I have always thought (and complained) that my hair has a mind of its own. Doesn&#x27;t matter who does my hair or what they put in it... give it a little time and it is back to its own thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Frieda is a name that I know, so I decide to give his straightener a try. Upon opening the box, I was pleasantly surprised. Simple design. Nice looking digital display. When I unwrapped the straightener, I was amazed at how long the cord is. It probably has the longest cord that I have ever had with a straightener. And the warm up time for this thing is practically zero. Within a few seconds of turning it on, I had a good amount of heat. And after setting my temperature, it was almost instantly there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product for about 24 hours now. And wow, I love it. After giving it a few test runs, I am so surprised by the results. Usually when I use a straightener, it takes no longer than 15-30 minutes before I feel like I am back where I started with my wavy, uncontrollable hair. But with this one, it is hours. I never thought I would be a straightener kinda girl, but this thing is changing my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this thing is amazing. My hair is kept straight with no product in it. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it was burned or fried. Actually, in my opinion, my hair looks shinier and feels softer than before I used it. I am beyond happy with this straightener.</li>
    <li> I usually flat iron my hair 3 times a week using a [[ASIN:B003V249L0 Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch]] so I am reasonably skilled in using flat irons. The John Frieda iron does a decent job styling your hair, but the cons stack up: 1. no lock to keep it shut, 2. no beep when ready, 3. on/off and temp controls are right where you hold it, so while styling you are turning it up or off. A shame, as my hair looked fine - it is just a pain to use &amp; store.</li>
    <li> I really struggled with how to rate this straighter. I like the look of it. I love how fast it heats up and even better, how quickly it cools down. I also love the digital temperature display and the ability to find just the right temperature. No more low, medium, high, ect...you can set the exact temp. It glides through my hair very smoothly and works very well to straighten and smooth any frizzies. It really is a very good straighter at a reasonable price.     However........the design is ridiculous. Did they not have anyone test this product? The controls are right on the front of the top handle. At first I was constantly turning the straighter off and on, then when I adjusted for that I was turning the temperature up and down and didn&#x27;t even know it. I kept trying and adjusting how to hold it and burned my hand a couple times trying to figure out a way to use it without hitting the controls. I sort of manage now by putting my thumb over the temperature display window, but it is akward and a completely unnecessary hurdle in using a fairly simple thing.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter who has been begging for a hair straightener for months. She was able to figure out how to use it herself and now spends several nights a week taking out her lovely curls with it. Grins. Build quality seems good, should last a while.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is very good, and affordable. Even though the buttons are where you hold the flat iron they do not change once u lock your temperature in. The steam vents on the side make it easy to straighten your roots without getting to close to the scalp. It is a very good flat iron</li>
    <li> It sucked no matter how you held it the buttons for the temperature are positioned in a way that whenever u hold the iron your fingers touch the temp buttons n it jumps around on you. Do not recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> Its a good iron, but the on/off and temp controls are in a bad place. When you use it, I end up turning it off or turning the heat down. Theres nothing to keep it closed. But its alot better than the one i had. It doesnt pull my hair, which some do. Makes my hair soft and shinny, a plus. Heats up super fast. Also it listed that it come with a heat protection pad...it doesnt...but all around good product.</li>
    <li> this straightner is very good. i have naturally curly hair and i thought it straightned better than my chi straightner does.  it gets very hot (455 degrees)  and i have burned my fingers  a few times. but i find it very smooth and works good on my hair. im glad i bought it!</li>
    <li> I have about shoulder length straight medium thick hair. I mostly use a straightener to style my hair, to straighten the little bit of wave I have in the front of my hair and to tame down my hair a bit. I previously owned [[ASIN:B002AEIML8 Conair CS19TCS Professional Instant Heat Straightener]] but after 5 years it died on me a week before I received this product. But, after using this John Frieda Flat Finish Straightener I think I like John Frieda way better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Automatic shut off after an hour of no use&lt;br /&gt;-Heating mat included with straightener&lt;br /&gt;-Heat temperatures from 275 to 455º&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up fast and all the way up to 455º&lt;br /&gt;-It makes my hair feel soft and shiny and not frizzy&lt;br /&gt;-Long cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the setting at 400º and it really does a great job straightening my hair, and it takes out the frizzies and makes it real shiny. I like how my hair looks when I am down with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I can find about this straightener right now is the on/off, and temperature plus/minus buttons are all one long blue button. They use the same button for all so if you want turn it on or off you press the bottom of the blue button if you want to up the temperature you press the top of the blue button. Some times I tried to up the temperature but it ended up lowering because I was pushing the blue button in the wrong spot. Also, the long blue button takes up the whole base of the straightener so it kind of forces you to hold it higher up where the heat is. I kept wanting to hold it next to the temperature part of the buttons and I kept changing the temperature by accident.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too happy with this purchase , however it is not because of the seller . I don&#x27;t like that the control settings are located on the handled where you hold the iron to press together to flat iron your hair. When I pressed the iron close , I keep shutting the iron either off or decreasing the temperatue</li>
    <li> This is a good product, works well. Heats up fast and cools down fast.  I saw that a lot of people wrote about the buttons being in a bad place, but I don&#x27;t see any real issue with that. You can simply turn the flat iron around. I wish that it locked in the closed position.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year now and it still works as well as the day I got it. Heats up extremely fast and works on all types of hair.</li>
    <li> I know, I know, the design sucks. But besides that, this flat iron works great. I got this three years ago at Sears on sale, and I thought the same thing , &amp;#34;what the crap, why are the buttons on the top?&amp;#34;. If you can find a way to place your fingers just right, and not push the buttons, this is a great flat iron. It is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. Definitely gets my hair the straightest out of the tons of flat irons I&#x27;ve been through. (I have a mix of Hispanic and African American hair). I&#x27;m considering buying another one just because I would like to have two handy. Give this a shot, I did, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> My daughter has kinky curlie hair and it works</li>
    <li> This was a great idea. It works so great, It heats up quick, and straightens quickly, and dosent burn my hair!</li>
    <li> This flat iron adds sooooo much life to my hair. It controls frizz on a rainy day and it works well as a curling iron too</li>
    <li> It was delivered in just a day and I used it for the first time today. I was very pleased with the results. Tooks just 10mins to straighten my curly hair. I did not face any issues with the buttons being where they are. Just rested the tip of my thumb on the display and never once did I accidentally hit any buttons.</li>
    <li> I just came back from where I purchased this flat iron.  After giving it much thought, I had to return it.  The long On/Off switch/Temperature Control button sits right where my thumb rested on the handle.  I tried changing the way I was holding it with no success.  I had to place my thumb on the plastic window over the digital temperature display in order to use it.  I wondered how long would the thin plastic window would last with me putting pressure on it everyday with my thumb.  It was very uncomfortable to hold.  The plates heat up quickly and the iron is lightweight; however, the ionic action in this iron did not do anything to add shine to my hair like the marketers of this product claim.  I didn&#x27;t expect a lot of features for the price, but the faulty design alone was enough to make me look for something better; so, I came back from the store with the Remington T-Studio Pearl Ceramic 1\\&quot; flat iron.  I tried it immediately when I got home, and WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  The Remington is very easy to use and leaves my hair smooth and shiny with only one slide of the plates.  I think I found a keeper!</li>
    <li> This was for my daughter and she is very satisfied with them and has not had any problrms with the flat irons.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this flat iron.  You have full control of the temp, it heats up quickly abd does it&#x27;s job well.  I never had any problems with the controls, although I could see why it would be an issue to some.  Just a heads up though, DO NOT curl your hair with this flat iron!  The outside plastic part actually melted slightly, enough to make my hair smell like burned plastic and gave me a bit of a silver melted plastic streaks!</li>
    <li> I have really thick and curly hair and this straightener takes care of it the way I like it. Worth the price, actually think it&#x27;s underpriced. The button thing is not much of an issue thing just be careful where you place your hand and the straightener won&#x27;t turn off on you.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!!! I never press buttons when I use</li>
    <li> Great brand, great price it works well on her curly hair and it helps her tame the frizz, no more bad hair days for her.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves it and works wonderfully without damaging her long and fine hair. She has some natural curl so this straightens it.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! I&#x27;ve tried others and none have came close to this this one recommended to me by my niece. This flat iron really gets my hair straight and it&#x27;s can last for about a month to a month and a half. It doesn&#x27;t take a long time to finish my whole head and I&#x27;m natural with shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Straightens hair but hair is still frizzy. Don&#x27;t know if it is the fault of the flat iron or the operator. I bought it for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to upgrade from my cheap straightener to a sleeker, more reputable brand.&lt;br /&gt;The iron heated up VERY quickly, and the LCD display was great!&lt;br /&gt;However, as soon as I clamped down on the first section of hair, the iron turned off! I figured it was a fluke, turned it back on and started again. Only then did I realize that my hand was actually pushing the power button as I used it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After trying a few awkward hand positions on the straightener, I finally gave up and had to return it for an item with more functionality.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Great value! I am very pleased with the case. It is exactly as described and fits perfectly. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love thix straightener!</li>
    <li> Excellent buy! I am so happy that I bought this flat iron. It&#x27;s the best of all of the about 10 flat irons I have gotten in the past 2 years and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality hair product. This is a great asset to have for women who love to make their hair look nice and clean</li>
    <li> My daughter owns one and I absolutely like this iron very much...I would recommend this product to friends. Planning on purchasing another.</li>
    <li> I know everyone says the heat switch is in the worst place (and it is), but I&#x27;ve been able to overcome that design flaw. I&#x27;m going to keep this baby because if you can get over that, it&#x27;s an amazing little flat iron. It&#x27;s lightweight. It heats quickly. It heats to a wonderfully hot temperature. It is curved on the edges so it doesn&#x27;t leave too much of straight edge on the side you start on your hair (like the top-most portion of hair you&#x27;re straightening); although it can a little if you&#x27;re not careful, but not as bad as some others I&#x27;ve had or tried. I love it. I bought it because my daughter has had one for months and highly recommended it. I will now also. The seller was great, too. Got the product quickly and in perfect condition. THANKS!!</li>
    <li> Because my hair is a bit coarse and very curly I was attracted to this iron by the &amp;#34;sleek finish&amp;#34; and 455 degree high heat, so I decided to give it a try…&lt;br /&gt;All the reviews about the poor product design of this iron are dead-on accurate.&lt;br /&gt;The iron is *great* as far as high heat, weight…it has smooth plates, and it&#x27;s even aesthetically pleasing to the eye. However, the heat controls and on/off buttons are set vertically along the top, in the very area where your hand lays when holding the iron--&lt;br /&gt;--sadly, making this an epic fail for product design. Its very *frustrating* with the constant and unintentional turning of the iron off, then on, then off again, etc. Same for the heat settings going up and down, up and down, etc, instead of remaining at the temperature it was set…Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;My first fleeting thought-- &amp;#34;Am I being punked?!&amp;#34;  But as highly unlikely as that was, the more likely probability is that this iron was designed and/or product tested by a man who never utilized a flat iron before. Unfortunately, it probably never occurred to (him) to test this iron for ACTUAL adequate usability. Sorry John Frieda :(.  I do like all your other products, though :)!</li>
    <li> I have always bought a CHI.  Decided to try something different.  I am VERY pleased and would buy John Frieda again.  As the other reviews stated it is very easy to turn the temperature up or down .</li>
    <li> I am a professional stylist. I know  a good item verses a crappy one is this item was really nice and well made ( not cheep at all) However, the designed is really messed up . the reviews are right. my opinion if you are going to use this iron once or twice a week for self use get this but if you are someone who will use this everyday and have think curly hair find something else it will be a pain in the butt .I ordered the HSI FLAT IRON 39.99 and the reviews are amazing...... for a few more dollars its worth it.. also if you zoom in on the pic there is a blue colored line well that the on/off switch  right were your hand would need to be to control this device .hope this helps</li>
    <li> The controls are on the top, which make it difficutl to hold while straightening your hair. I find that I am either changing the temperature or turning the straightener off.</li>
    <li> everyone does talk about the way the buttons are kinda makes it hard to handle cause sometimes you accidentally turn it off which happened to me a few times but i got the hang of it and learned how to hold it in a way to where it wont do that. it is a good straightener, heats up really fast and cools down quick. i have super curly hair and this straightener does exactly what i need it to do!!</li>
    <li> I own the T3 Single Pass flat iron and a GHD flat iron. The T3 seems to damage my hair by burning, breaking off my hair, and even drying it out. The Sleek Finish works better than both my T3 and GHD. It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and sleek, without burning it. You don&#x27;t have to spend $200-$300 for a great flat iron. Just get this one! You won&#x27;t be left feeling cheated out of your hard earned money and you&#x27;ll have nice healthy hair :)</li>
    <li> My wife tells me this is a great product and rivals her $150 salon purchased one.  This one even apparently heats up faster than the more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my wife likes it, then I would say it is a safe bet for a solid purchase.</li>
    <li> Iron works great on my naturally curly hair. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener at Walgreens, and the other reviews are correct, that the buttons are right where your thumb lands for straightening. But I haven&#x27;t had the same problem as the others because if you read the instructions, I think I remember it saying that you have to wait 15 seconds for the temperature to lock. Once the temp locks, even if your thumbs hit the buttons, it doesn&#x27;t change the temp unless you hold down the off or on button for a few seconds. For this price, it&#x27;s a very good straightener, it holds heat, it doesn&#x27;t catch strands of my hair in the hinges and plates like my last one did, and I&#x27;ve used it for over a year. So while the button placement is a little weird, for the price, I love it!</li>
    <li> Was a waste of time ordering this product. Now it can&#x27;t be used in Australia because the power adapter is not suitable to use in Australia. I have looked in a number of stores for a adapter but was unsuccessful. Not a happy shopper :-(</li>
    <li> Had them for a week used them twice not been able to use again spring between the two arms came out and cannot be put back.would like to return and have money back but no idea how to do this</li>
    <li> What can I say, I am not the most capable person in the world when it comes to doing my hair, but so far this straightener works for me. It is true as other reviewers noted that the controls are a bit too close to where you are supposed to hold it, but you can move your hand and still hold it comfortably. So far I do like it.</li>
    <li> Does the job. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it. While you are using it. You can keep hitting the the button. It can turn off and down.</li>
    <li> This is my second one I have bought.  My puppy eat the cord on my other one, so I had to use my old Chi straightener, which I didn&#x27;t realize was absolutely horrible to go back to.  I finally got my new one in the mail and couldn&#x27;t be any happier.  It is so much easier to use, nicer on my and my daughter&#x27;s hair, its just the best straightener out there.</li>
    <li> The straightener work but not the best</li>
    <li> It works amazing and I only accidentally hit the up button which seeing I always have it on high it works great no problems besides a weird buzzing noise when in use.</li>
    <li> Like many other users, I liked the look of it, I forgot my straightener at home and left 3 hours away so instead of having my mother ups it I just bought a new one. I decided to spend the extra 20 dollars on the &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; straightener - i liked the look, I thought for the extra 20 bucks I&#x27;d get a better daily tool. Unfortunately, it looks great, it works well too, but like other users, the design is kind of silly. It takes me an additional 10ish minutes to do anything to my hair cause I accidentally turn it off. the dial on the side design was beyond better. I&#x27;d honestly next time go with the conair pro.</li>
    <li> It heats fast, easy to use. Love the sleek finish and my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught. It straightens my hair easily</li>
    <li> Power buttons are right where you grip the iron so it turns on and off.  Returned it!</li>
    <li> I use this flat iron every day.  I love that you can set the digital temperature.  It has held up very well over the last six months. It has not damaged my hair either.  Great purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Dislike product everytime I try to use i press the off button.  The on/off switch is in the wrong place.</li>
    <li> I love it! Easy to handle. Heats up fast, cools off fast for storage. As far as the controls, no problem, you have to push firm so you really can&#x27;t turn off by accident.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron it heats uo to 455 degrees its amazing. If you are familiar with the Paul Mitchell brand its about the exact same quality.  Its amazing on natural hair and extensions. I did a silk press on my natural hair with it and you would have thought i had a relaxer. I ordered this because i stepped on my first one and it broke. I was so upset because i purchased it from the store for $100. On my quest to find a new flat iron i decided to see if it was available on amazon and suprise it was and for $25 best deal ever. I love amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a really good straightener!  It is falling victim to the &amp;#34;poor design&amp;#34; reviews which it deserves I suppose.  But it&#x27;s not like its that hard to learn how to hold it without messing with the buttons.  It&#x27;s mega affordable compared to my CHI that died (may it R.I.P.) and guess what?  It works about the same for about $100 less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this if you want a cheaper alternative to the &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; used straighteners.  It&#x27;s really quite awesome, and it shouldn&#x27;t take you long to get around that design problem.  I just flip it over...problem solved.</li>
    <li> I love, love, LOVE the way this iron heats up, and it is comfortable to hold.  Problem is that as others have mentioned, the controls keep getting hit in the process of using it, which makes a delicate task (heat near face + constantly fumbling with buttons &#x3D; bad) sort of annoying.  I wound up just ignoring them after a while and readjusting as necessary.  Still, it was both cumbersome and annoying.  Hopefully with future iterations of the product they will fix this issue.</li>
    <li> Very light weight and easy to hold. I don&#x27;t find any issues with the positioning of the controls. Heats and cools fast.</li>
    <li> The straightener is a good straightener but I am not satisfied with the placement settings on it...if I would&#x27;ve known it was gonna shut off almost every time I use it I wouldn&#x27;t of paid that price for it:/ is there anyway I can get some time of credit back?  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I subjected this product to the ultimate test audience: two fifteen year old girls.  I sat with the two young ladies while they used the John Frieda Flat Finish Straightener.  Both girls commented on how the iron heated quickly and evenly, and didn&#x27;t friz their hair.  Both girls have naturally curly hair, and other straighteners without the ceramic plates get so hot that it left their hair frizzy on the ends.  The John Frieda iron gave a smoothe, even effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback: the control buttons are poorly placed, and the girls complained about having to turn the iron back on or adjust the temperature setting back to where they wanted it set.  All of the operation buttons are on top of the handle, right where the thumb would go to safely hold the iron.  The girls eventually got used to this problem, but it took some time and a little bit of fussing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a well-functioning product, but we think that the controls should be placed farther forward on the handle.</li>
    <li> Review courtesy of Missus 1rude:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared the John Freida 1\\&quot; Flat Finish  with my old iron, a 1 5/8\\&quot; Conair Ultra Slim Model CS25, by straightening one side of my hair with the JF, the other side with the Conair.  Both have adjustable heat settings.  I thought I would prefer the Conair for its larger plate size, but the JF heated up instantly (and cools down almost as fast), as advertised, and slid through my hair easily, making it much quicker to get the same results as the Conair (sometimes my hair will get caught and break in the Conair, I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the JF).  I&#x27;d be willing to get rid of my old Conair but for one thing: the design of the JF makes it a hassle to use.  It is almost impossible to use the JF without turning it off or changing the heat settings, which are quite senstive and located exactly where you hold it.  Since I got the JF as a gift, I&#x27;ll probably keep it for a bit to see if I can figure out a way to make the quick, easy and smooth results worth the ridiculous design flaw, but if I&#x27;d actually shelled out $50 for it, I&#x27;d probably return it and get something else.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron would be perfect if it would stay on!!  The design is poor and the on/off button and the temp setting is put right where I would grip the iron.  I kept shutting it off and changing the temp every time I grabbed it.  Clearly, it wasn&#x27;t tested even once before being produced.  I hope I have my receipt to return this!!!</li>
    <li> This straightener works great. The only thing going against it, is that the controls are in an awkward place; and the window that shows the heat temperature is not illuminated, so it is hard to see in dark areas.  Otherwise, it is great!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is by far the best! It shines your hair without putting anything in it. I have course hair and it was beyond flat! Must buy! :)</li>
    <li> the best straightener i have ever bought!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i did read about the off button and all that and u just need to place ur hand properly and you&#x27;ll be fine!  i love ever product from John Frieda!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have thin but naturally curly hair that can get frizzy when straightening. This is the first straightener I have used that makes my hair straight, smooth, and shiny, without over drying.I have tried several other high dollar, big name straighteners, and this one is by far the best.  I have no problems with the the button placement and the rounded edges make beautiful curls. I have had this straightener for about three years and even though it has suffered several falls, still works perfectly. I am ordering a new one, but will keep the old one as back-up or for traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron about a year and a half ago and I love it. A lot of the reviews that I have read complain about the buttons being on top, but I&#x27;ve only accidentally turned my straightener off 3 or 4 times and it heats up so quickly that it was not a big deal. This straightener also leaves me completely frizz free, which is quite a feat for my hair. Now, the main reason I love it is because of the round design as oppose to the commonly seen rectangular design. When trying to curl my hair with a rectangular flat iron, it tends to leave weird creases in my hair. But with this straightener I get perfectly rounded, bouncy curls! I&#x27;m actually going to purchase this flat iron again because the paint is chipping off and the plates are burned but that&#x27;s no surprise after using it nearly everyday for almost 2 years.</li>
    <li> I have never written a product review before, but am motivated to review this item as I sit here with yet another burn on my hand. This product was designed by someone unfamiliar with the human practice of using our hands to hold tools. The controls are all in the handle, and as I attempt to use this flat iron, I am CONSTANTLY turning the heat up, or down, or turning the whole thing off. When I try to hold it in some awkward way to avoid hitting the controls, I almost always end up burning my fingers. I become frustrated every time I use it, and it is going in the garbage tonight!</li>
    <li> I have very coarse, thick, &#x27;kinky&#x27; hair...my Babyliss passed away (RIP) and I bought this thinking, &amp;#34;450 degrees-awesome, John Frieda makes frizz-ease- awesome...this should work great!&amp;#34;....wrong. Firstly, the package does not mention that it is ceramic...and it is definitely ceramic which makes a night and day difference. Secondly, you would think that this would make an awesome dual straightener/curler from it&#x27;s design...wrong again. It&#x27;s very disappointing. My hair takes forever to straighten with this iron. I have a lot of damage since using it as well. If you&#x27;re going to bargain shop with flat irons, I suggest checking out the Remington one...used my friend&#x27;s and loved it (Allure mag. gives awesome reviews about best bargain flat irons)...Personally, I am going to bite the bullet and buy either the Babyliss (which I know works great) or the Croc...don&#x27;t let the shiny sleek packaging on this fool you. Oh, I also have the hair dryer which is not AS disappointing but still left me less than thrilled with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> It is the best flat iron I have ever had. It hears up fast and straightens your hair fast. I also love the heat settings. Great product!!</li>
    <li> It works great to straighten or curl hair, comes out perfect everytime I use it. Only MINOR problem is I might change the temperature of it by accident but then again it&#x27;s no big deal, you still get your results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because John Frieda is supposed to be a great name in the hair world, especially for humidity and frizz. However, when I used this flat-iron my hair was still very frizzy. It did hold up in the humidity but not after a workout. I used several frizz and humidity products with it and an ionic blow-dryer. I expected more.</li>
    <li> When i recieved my flat iron was already chipped and paint was coming off.</li>
    <li> This could have been a great product.  It feels good, substantial and well-made.  It looks elegant.  It heats up fast.  As others have noted, there is one flaw: the controls are located where your fingers naturally hold onto the iron.  It makes it essentially unusable.  The slightest pressure changes the temperature or turns it off.  It is ridiculously poor design, so I&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
    <li> I received my item quickly!! Not a negative towards seller!! However the buttons were placed in a bad spot, easy to turn the heat up/down or turn it off while using it...</li>
    <li> I REALLY like this straightener. I have lots of frizzy, curly hair that is on the fine side, and this straightener is the best I have ever used! There have been some complaints by other reviewers about the placement of the controls, but this would not deter me from purchasing this straightener again. A very simple 1 inch move of your hand fixes that.</li>
    <li> I agree with a lot of other posts here.  Who designed this thing? Certainly someone who never used a flat iron,  To grip it closed your hand has to press don&#x27;t right where all the controls are so I&#x27;m constantly turning it off, or changing the temp without knowing it.&lt;br /&gt;Also- I have to use it in a pretty dark room in the morning while someone is sleeping and I can&#x27;t believe they didn&#x27;t add a little light to indicate if it is on or off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been pleased with John Frieda hair products but this one is a big thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I think the very worst thing about this flat iron would have to be button placement.  I thought some of the other reviewers might have been a little over dramatic when it came to the buttons.  No, they were all 100% correct. I know what you&#x27;re thinking, because I thought the exact same thing \\&quot;All flat irons have the control buttons on the top of the unit and your hand covers the buttons while you use it.\\&quot;  With my old flat iron the control button were lower in the plastic case, with this flat iron there is one long control button and it is raised above the plastic case of the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I would straighten a piece of hair I either A) turned the flat iron off or B) changed the temperature setting.  Which was very frustrating to say the least.  my suggestion for the button issue would be to turn the flat iron upside down and place the plam of your hand on the smooth bottom side of the flat iron, place your thumb on one side of the control button (or even on the LCD display) and keep your fingers on the other side of the control button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the long plates, the long power cord, and the LCD display.  But at the end of the day I had to return this flat iron.  I feel the button placement issue almost makes the flat iron nonfunctional.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this at a store and used it twice before becoming so frustrated I returned it and come to amazon to look for another. I completely agree with the others.  The button placement is TERRIBLE! I repeatedly turned it off while trying to straighten my hair.  The good news was it does heat up quickly, but there are no audible alerts to let you know when it had reached the desired temperature or that you have turned it on/off.</li>
    <li> I just bought a John Frieda sleek FINISH...actually two. The first one I took back because it made a low buzzing sound (very faint) and I was a bit worried...the replaced one did the same. Is this normal? It seems to do a great job on my hair...so I will rate it well. I am awaiting a reply from the company about the sound...anyone else experience this...hope its not an electrical fault.    Edited to say that I received a reply from Conair and apparently the buzzing sound is the ionic charger and it is normal. Perhaps they should explain that in the instructions.</li>
    <li> I purchased the same John Frieda flat iron tonight at Walgreen for $39.00, and used it right away. Yes, it definitely needs a re-design, but it makes my kinky (which I love) curly hair so soft, shiny and silky when I straightened it, I can live with it the way it is. I would buy another one too! I found that if I hold just a little past the temp screen, it works for me. I purchased a Chi, at J.C.Penny retail valued around $100.00 and took it straight back... my hair smelled burnt, and there was no way to adjust the temp. Hefty price does not necessarily indicate worth.</li>
    <li> I love it after reading reviews i was scared, so many people talked about the the buttons and how they would turn it off. I havent had a problem</li>
    <li> please dont waste you time buying this product. it is a waste of morning. I just dont understand why they would put the on button on the surface. I have to rush to work and I dont have the time to be fighting with a flat iron. I had to give this product away to a friend.</li>
    <li> my sister loved, shes been waning this and i been trying to look for it and finally found it he.</li>
    <li> This straightener is by far the best I have ever owned, I&#x27;ve tried the Chi and all the others. I have very thick hair and straightening it takes forever, this straightener has cut that down to 1/3. It&#x27;s so much less damaging then goin  over the same strand over and over. Yes, the design is flawed  like the other review say but it&#x27;s really not as earth shattering as others make it seem. I can&#x27;t say how much I love this straightener.</li>
    <li> As many mentioned in other reviews, the temperature and on/off button are right where you fingers would be when using the iron so that you&#x27;re constantly turning the temperature down or off while using it. It&#x27;s so dumb. I then burned myself trying to holder higher up to avoid the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the iron itself works great but it&#x27;s way too frustrating. They clearly did not test this item out before putting it on the market. Makes me question the company in general. Please recall this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned. I today ordered my second one, my first one lasted me a full 2 years! How the buttons are on the handle is inconvenient, but it only look me a few weeks to master holding it with out pressing buttons while doing my hair. The design is a struggle at first, but is not hard to get used it. It leaves my hair incredibly soft and silky, which is incredible because I have very long, thick hair. After using it for 2 year, I had EXTREMELY little split ends. A very amazing product! Adjust yourself to get used to the design, and you will fall in love with the flat iron.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many a straightener but this one is great. Doesn&#x27;t fry my hair like others have in the past,. Like the temperature control. I know some say the power and temp control is in a bad spot. I don&#x27;t disagree but it&#x27;s definitely manageable. I&#x27;ve had this about 7 months now and I think I&#x27;ve accidentally shut it off while using it maybe twice. I highly recommend this product :0)</li>
    <li> I have has this straightener for almost a year now and I think that it is safe to say that I absolutely hate it. The controls are in a terrible spot so it is hard to use without unconsciously changing the temperature, there is no beep to know it is preheated, it snags and damages my hair, and it feels VERY cheaply made! The only reason I haven&#x27;t replaced it is because I am a broke college student and this one cost me $50 as it is. Please save yourself the time, money, and needless hair damage!</li>
    <li> Purchased this in a store over the weekend and I should have checked Amazon reviews first.  It is poorly designed, making it difficult to use.  Every time I use the straightener, my fingers press the buttons, adjusting the temperature setting and turning it on and off.  When I hold it just right (it seems to be best when I hold it in the middle although this is very close the the plates), it does work well in straightening my hair.  However, due to the poor design, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I received it in the mail faster than i expected and used it right away. unlike my amika straightener, i like that i can adjust the heat on the john frieda straightener. it also leaves my hair REALLY REALLY soft, this has to be the best straightener ive ever used. Ive had it for a while and dont have any issues with it at all. ive read in other reviews that they have trouble holding the straightener without turning the heat up or down.... i dont know what they&#x27;re talking about, because it works just fine for me and i havent had any problems with the heat turning up or down. overall its a great product and i would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a flat iron in years because I wanted to avoid heat damage. But this flat iron allows you to choose the amount of heat you want to put on your hair. I ended up only having to pass through each section of my hair twice, and I have coily type hair. Also if you use a heat protection product before flat ironing, it will lock in the moisture leaving your hair incredibly soft. The only problem, like other people have mentioned before, is with the design of the product. You have to make sure that you don&#x27;t accidentally change the settings chosen while using the flat iron.</li>
    <li> I know a lot of ppl complain about how the buttons are really ignoring cuz it&#x27;s right on the handles. But I found it okay to hold the handles a bit higher to avoid this issue.&lt;br /&gt;and come on, look at the price. this is worth it. Only take literally 10 sec to heat up the Flat Iron. where else do you find a product with this quality?</li>
    <li> This is my second flat iron from John Frieda. Been using the same model for several years because it&#x27;s the best. I even rate it higher than the more expensive ones like Chi.</li>
    <li> I would have to say love that you can set the temperature,it&#x27;s very stylish.  I do agree that they should have tested this flat iron; when you start to straighten your hair the minus part is that easily you can change the temperature control since is set straight in the middle where you have to grip...other than that it works fine.</li>
    <li> I love this!  My friend bet me $5 that I wouldn&#x27;t keep my hair straight for the rest of the school year (got this in January)...well, she lost and she owes me!  It is easy to use!</li>
    <li> The straightener arrived with no instructions and no warranty.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> When I got it in the mail, the first thing I did was plug it in to make sure it works and sure enough it was broken.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this straightener is extremely light weight and sleek and has all of the bells and whistles I was looking for (ceramic, ionic, swivel cord, digital, right temps, rounded edges, etc).  And thanks to Black Friday, I got a great deal on it.  HOWEVER - I CANNOT understand HOW a develop/research committee could approve this model.  The on/off/temp adjust switch is RIGHT WHERE YOUR FINGERS GO when you hold it in your hand!!!!!  It&#x27;s COMPLETELY INSANE!!!!!!  I wish I was a fly on the wall when they tested this model.  I&#x27;d like to see how they used it without constantly changing the temperature!</li>
    <li> bought this in 2012 and its still going! not a devoted flat iron person but this has never failed me! the only thing im not excited about is the location of the on/off button. sometimes i accidentally turn off the iron while using it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay straighter, Probably good for someone without decently curly hair. I already have a Chi and I got this one on sale for about 12$ so I was more than willing to buy a backup straightener in case of any emergency, Its taken me about an hour and multiple times going over the same spot (10-15 times) and it says it goes to 455 degrees, There is no way it gets as hot as it says but as I said, Its okay at most for anyone who really needs a straightener. I would never pay more than about 20 dollars for this one.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have stated, the controls are in a horrible place, so you&#x27;re constantly turning it on or off.  It&#x27;s like they had some men do the quality control or something, no woman who straightens their hair would&#x27;ve tested this out and given approval.  It also makes some weird sounds, sort of like popping or crackling, which makes me worried about the electrical components.  It works great to straighten, but the design overshadows it all.</li>
    <li> I had been so excited to get a ceramic straightener but was clearly sucked in by the price and did not do my homework.&lt;br /&gt;The design is horrible. The location of the power button makes it almost impossible to use without constantly turning it on and off by accident. There is also no clear indicator of when its ready. I used it once and am giving it away.</li>
    <li> I was dumb and hoped this would be a decent flat iron because it costs more.  It is a very poor design and not worth the money.  The iron has a thin blue bar that runs the length of the handle.  The bar serves as the on/off button but also as the increase/decrease temperature button.  It is a major design flaw because it is impossible to avoid changing the temperature as you use it.  Also, mine did not turn off using the button, it only turned off when I unplugged it.  A final complaint is that it did not move smoothly through my hair, it snagged on my hair, which will of course cause damage and it hurt!  I will stick with my inexpensive Revlon flat iron which works better by far, I just wanted a second one for the gym and could not find another by Revlon at the time.  John Frieda, save face and take your name off of this sad Chinese import!</li>
    <li> I bought this product at walgreens and it works pretty good the only complaint I have is that power button is where you hold it to pass it on your hair. Also it heats up really quick which is great!</li>
    <li> The quality is decent. Hair gets caught in the plastic part of the plates and you have to be extra careful not to hurt yourself. The control buttons are where your hands are supposed to go. I usually leave great feedback but I made a mistake buying this product as I found it cheaper at Target, and it is not worth the price to me. It&#x27;s unfortunate that John Frieda put his name on this product. Spend the extra $10 and get yourself a better straightener.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair, this product did a small percentage of making it straght. I am unpleased with this product.</li>
    <li> The design is very poor.  On most flat irons, the buttons/dials are inside and out of the way.  My hands are small and I could not iron my hair without touching one of the buttons; each time resulting in a level change.  To top it off, it does not even come close to straightening your hair as we would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a two star rating because if you have that rebellious section, uncooperative strand that always gives you trouble, then yeah this curling will do the trick.  Other than that, yeah, save your hard earned money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Zach&#x27;s wife</li>
    <li> ONE OF THE BEST FLAT IRONS EVER,. I LOVE IS 455 DEGREES, THE BEST</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing I love it! It is my favorite, I&#x27;ve had it for a year and it works amazing</li>
    <li> As other buyers have stated, you cannot hold the iron without turning it off, or changing the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous. I bought it because of the name...big mistake.</li>
    <li> I have never used a better straightener</li>
    <li> The buttons are placed horribly. I turn it off every time I straighten a chunk of hair.</li>
</ol>
