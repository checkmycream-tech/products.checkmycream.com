<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So much fun. A great party item.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 7yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it! We&#x27;ve used it multiple times with no problems at all - gems go on easily, stay on and are simple to remove (just slide them off the hair) and reuse. Instant bling :D We haven&#x27;t had a problem with the number of gems that come with the product, since they&#x27;re reusable and they don&#x27;t fall out easily. In fact, we have yet to lose one, despite them being in place for some very energetic dances.</li>
    <li> My 5-year old just got this for Christmas and it works really well.  It&#x27;s a lot of fun and the beads do not get stuck in your hair.  They go in easily and come out easily when you want them to.  A really fun item for a little girl!</li>
    <li> I purchased one for my daughter, her cousin and one as a future gift.  The girls love them, they are easy to use for young girls (7 and 8 years old).  The gems stay secure, even with active girls.  The shipment was sent out qucikly, I would purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She likes it.  It puts pretty gems in her hair.  As a mother, however, I don&#x27;t care for it.  The gems are made in such a way that damages hair.  The gems are made up of 2 gems that are held together by a small spring in between them.  You put a section of hair in the jeweler, the machine then stretches the spring open and puts it onto the hair, then releases the spring.  They stay in really well.  When you want to take them out you have to pull on each side of the gem and pull the spring apart, then pull it out of their hair.  I just find that even when I&#x27;m being very careful I always break hair.  It might be fine to use once in a great, great while but if you used it often your little girls beautiful hair would have a ton of broken pieces, which eventually looks awful. I ended up pulling out as much hair as I did jewels. If you want to look cute - then go for it.  If you want your hair to look healthy - avoid this product. &lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d tried Conair&#x27;s quick bead machine instead.</li>
    <li> This is a lot of fun for my niece but it jams up everytime. It is can be fixed and the jewels are reusable. They come out easily if they go in right.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 4 year old daughter to have fun with her hair.  She loves for me to dress her up with jewels in her hair.  The product is very easy to use and I have had no difficulty getting the gems to stay in her hair or removing them at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> My 5 year old daughter got one of these for Christmas. She loves it. It is easy to use. When her friends come over she always puts them in their hair. They come out easily. This makes a great birthday gift for a girl.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty user friendly, and my girls really like it.  The gems are attached together by springs that the machine spreads to grab hold of the hair.  They recommend hanks of hair about 1/4 in, and the little jewels stay pretty secure.  When it&#x27;s time to take them out, you pull the gems apart and slide them slowly down the strand of hair.  Then you just manually place them back in the machine.  I would recommend to friends interested in buying, fairly advertized product for the price.</li>
    <li> my niece loved it.  she used it on my hair once and it worked great, stayed put and the gems were reusable.  Fun!</li>
    <li> This is a really fun product for girls.  It works great and the jewels look so cute in their hair.  It&#x27;s easy to use as well.</li>
    <li> I just love this , its very easy to use and gr8 way to beautiful hair for any princess  I have a 3 year old she loves it!!</li>
    <li> Wow got this today was going to give it to my daughter for Christmas the box was open and as soon as I pulled it out of the shipping package jewels fell all over the floor. That was pretty irritating. Didn&#x27;t known I was buying an open box hair tool.Not too happy.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old granddaughter asked for this Conair Hair Jeweler for Christmas. She loves it, she says it so easy and fast to use! It puts beads in her hair one two three!</li>
    <li> So much fun...even for adults!</li>
    <li> My 6 year old daughter and I both love this product. We have NO problem getting the gems out of our hair--even less hair pulled out than a pony tail holder in our experience AND no complaining from my daughter (a miracle). It really works in every type of hair we&#x27;ve tried it on--long, short, straight and curly.</li>
    <li> I bought Quick Gems for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!  I was afraid that the gems would not attach easily or would fall out but nothing could be further from the truth.  They attach in about 1 second and do not come out until you take them out.  My 9yo can put them in and take them out by herself. We love the fact that the gems are reusable.</li>
    <li> I received it pretty quickly, even though I ordered it over the xmas holidays, I did not get it by xmas, but I also did not expect too becuz I ordered it so late.  It did come right after xmas, which was sooner than I expected.  It worked great, my granddaughter saw the ad on t.v. and said she wanted it, which is why I ordered it.  She loved it, it worked just like it said it would on the advertisement.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great and jewels are placed easy in the hair but they&#x27;re hard to replace and expensive!</li>
    <li> i got this item for my 5 year old, because everytime she saw the commercial she would sing to it and said she wanted it. when we got it and tried it on her hair i was impressed with how well it works. but i wouldn&#x27;t suggest this item for such a young consumer lol, she pulled them all out within minutes. it would be really cool though for preteens!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, fairly easy to remove gems, sure to please a sparkle loving girl.</li>
    <li> My twin girls love it!!!! They are 8, and they wear them everywhere-I even bought a few more for gifts-very easy to do, but needs more gems-I ordered replacements on line, because nobody carries them in the stores. Its a lot of fun, and fast, too for great looking hair!!!!</li>
    <li> My soon-to-be six year old saw the commercial for the Conair Quick Gems on Disney and wished more than anything that Santa would bring it to her. He did. A waste of money. It was difficult for her to use, the gems were difficult to remove once put in her hair. Now I&#x27;m finding the little buggers all over the house. It works as described but is meant for 10 years or older in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my 10 yr old daughter who saw it on TV.  It was exactly what was advertised, it&#x27;s easy to use and lots of fun.  She is getting alot of use out of it, as it can be used over and over.  I am glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who saw it on TV for a much higher price. It&#x27;s easy enough for my six year old to do it.  But what I don&#x27;t like is that you can only use a very small thickness of hair and the gems seem like they are going to fall out. (although this has not happened)Otherwise I think this is a nice product.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter just HAD to have this product.. She is 7... She didn&#x27;t use it at all... She has long hair...</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my 10yr for Christmas.  She loves it and it is very easy to use.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I havent used it as of yet, but it seem to look well made so I hope to use it soon.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 7 year old who thinks she&#x27;s a tween.  She loves it and so do I. The gems go in easily and stay in pretty much all day even with an active child.  They come out easily too, just put your fingers in the gems to separate the coil so it does not pull out hair.  Better choice for younger kids than the hair coloring system that she wanted.</li>
    <li> I was dead set against buying this but it was a request by my daughter for Christmas.  The beads attach to one single strand of your hair despite the instructions telling you to take about 1/4\\&quot; of hair.  They basically have a spring mechanism in the middle of the gems that you pull apart to remove from the hair.</li>
    <li> Glad it was new. Glad I found it here and didn&#x27;t have to run all over town in search.</li>
    <li> Very cute and great idea. Gave this as a gift to a friends 7 year old daughter. She has had a lot of fun with it. Purchased extra jewels as this didnt come with a lot of jewels. For the price its great, but kinda disappointed on the amount of jewels conair provides. The extra pack i purchased was half the cost of this! And it really wasnt that many more jewels. Overall its a great product, its fun for little girls, and i will buy one for my daughter who will be turning 5 soon.</li>
    <li> This product is great for fashion conscious preteen girls. I got this for my sister for her 10th birthday and its all she can play with now. The jewels stay put in her hair for a long time. She used about 20 jewels on the first day and shockingly they were still in her hair when she came home from school. My only problem is that you have to pull on it a little hard to pull the gems out, which may or may not pull out a few hairs. Other than that its a great little toy for girls.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to use this. Once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s fun to use and decorate your hair with. She was 8yrs when we got it and able to do it by herself. We did order extra gems.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and she loves it.  She and her friends are able to easily out jewels in their hair and more importantly they come out easily.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas.  Its very easy to use and reuse.  The jewels slide out of her hair easily without pulling out hairs.  The reusable jewels are easy to refill.  She and her cousins had lots of fun with it.  I&#x27;m buying my niece one for her January birthday.  I do recommend buying some refills if more than one girl is playing with it.</li>
    <li> Girls really like this tool.  It occasionally doesn&#x27;t work right or gems get jammed.</li>
    <li> The item was received in excellent condition well before Christmas, without my using a special delivery method.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this.  She can&#x27;t see around the sides or the back so she has me put the gems in for her, so I now have to allow for extra time in the mornings to put these in her hair, but they stay in real well during the day and come out pretty easily when you want them to.  The only problem is that her hair looks pretty ratty by the end of the day because she can&#x27;t brush it without messing up the gems.</li>
    <li> You have to make sure that you have a very specific amount of hair to put these on--if it&#x27;s too small, they fall off; if it&#x27;s too big, they fall off.  We&#x27;re getting the hang of it the more we use it, though.  My daughter was so pleased to get this!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 8 year old as a Christmas gift. She loves it.  It seems easy to use, the gems stay in her hair, and they come out with little fuss.</li>
    <li> This gift was given to my 10 year old grand daughter,for her birthday.She has plenty  of hair,to put the beads in,LMAO!!!!!</li>
    <li> It either pulls your hair into it, or if you have thin hair it wont stay on at all. Then you find the gems on the floor (because they fall out) after you&#x27;ve stepped on it! &lt;br /&gt;OUCH!</li>
    <li> I bought Quick Gems for my 9 year old daughter for her birthday and she loves it! She puts the gems in her hair by herself. The only problem I have is finding all those little gems around the house! But - overall a great product that any little girl will love.</li>
    <li> Disappointed :-( When I received the Gem hair Jeweler my first clue that there was going to be a problem was the package was already opened. I only received 26 of the advertised 30 jewels and there were 3 colored jewels that were not even for this particular jeweler . Unfortunately my girls school pictures were that week( in which I promised them jeweled hair) so I would not have time to return this item!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s fun and very easy to use. The gems come out very easily and can be reused. My daughter loves this and so do I.</li>
    <li> I think it is cute.  It pulls a little when taking the gems out of your hair, but my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought two for my grandchildren.  They love it and can do it themselves.  It has about 30 beads so if you want extra you will have to buy the extra beads.  I did not do that as of yet.  I wanted to see how they would like this.  But since they do I guess I have to buy the extra beads.  You can reuse them.  I think it is cute when they put them in their hair.  I would recommend this product.  Since Conair does make good products.</li>
    <li> my daughter lovers to bejewel her hair this is easy to use as long as you don&#x27;t rush the machine</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who is 6.  She loves it.  She received this from Santa.  We have used it every day.  It is easy to snap the Gems in her hair.  It is easy to remove.  It does not pull out anymore hair than say a pony tail holder.  I thought when I purchased this oh no I am in for it now.  But it is so easy to put the jewels in the Quick Gem.  It is fast and easy to apply the gems to her hair.  It is fast and easy to remove.  Great price for a great product. Now I wish that I had purchased 2 of them. The next time I see this in the store I will definitely buy another one.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I thought the product worked ok, but my 9 year old daughter says that the gems fall out of her hair very easily.  I guess it just takes practice on how much hair to use in each strand.  She is frustrated and doesn&#x27;t want to use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, create quick styles. My 5 yr old neice loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 Conair Ouick Gems Hair Jewelers for 2 granddaughters. They absolutely love them. I have no regrets. They are worth the money and the jewels look great in their hair.</li>
    <li> My 9 yr old daughter just HAD TO HAVE THIS:)  We bought it along with extra gems.  When it finally arrived, she was ecstatic!  She has used it approximately 2-3 times...in the five months she&#x27;s had it!  Is your child any different than mine?...I doubt it!  LOL:)  I say, use your own judgement.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are cute for the little time they stay in their hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst products I have ever bought. The jewels always get stuck in the chamber, and then they get broken when you try to free them from the jam! We used it twice and then I threw it out. Do not buy this unless you like junk.</li>
    <li> This was a hit with the 9 year old birthday girl who received it.However,i came in a padded mailer and inside it was just wrapped in a plastic bag. no box or anything. I was disappointed in the packaging and considered that it wouldn&#x27;t look new when I gave the gift. I also wished I had ordered extra gems.</li>
    <li> We gave this to our 5 year old niece for Christmas. We showed her once how it worked, then she had no problems using it herself. This toy was also very popular with her four sisters and girl cousin, all 3-8 yo. Each girl had sparkles in the hair within a few minutes! Even the boys were interested. When it was time to take out the jewels from their hair,  no one complained about the pulling. I was also jeweled and experienced just a little tug when removing the piece. I do wish this tool had a bag for storage,  though. It would be good for keeping track of jewels, but we simply used a Ziploc.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and I LOVED it. The gems clipped in my hair so easily and quickly. Then when I wanted to take them out they slid off so easily. I was surprised to see how well it worked! It is very quiet when it puts the gem in your hair. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This puts cute little gems in your hair as an accessory. It worked great. I don&#x27;t know how easy it would be to do your own but I did it for my daughter and it worked great. I think it should come with a lot of beads because it only came with enough to do your hair once and then you have to wait to order more and if you have more than one person who wants theirs done you don&#x27;t have enough to do them both so I would recommend buying extra gems for it.</li>
    <li> This product was easy to use, but the gems get tangled in the hair and will slide right out if the hair is thin.  Not a good value for the money, and can be very frustrating for the child.</li>
    <li> My daughter received this for Christmas.  It is a lot of fun to put the jewels in.  It comes with a fair number of them, but I will be buying more.  It is easy to use, but hard to determine just the right amount of hair to put in it.  If you put too little, the gem will fall out, and too much, it won&#x27;t close properly.&lt;br /&gt;The good news is the gems are reusable so you can keep at it until you get it right.&lt;br /&gt;Fun hair accessory!</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 and only one arrived in the package on Christmas Eve. Even tho packing slip says quantity 2 :(  really disappointed .....</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 9 year old niece&#x27;s birthday and she loves it!  It is so easy to use, she can bedazzle her hair herself.  The gems look adorable in her hair.</li>
    <li> The gems stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair for like 2 seconds.  It is a cute idea and it is very easy for my 5 year old daughter to do, but it does not work effectively.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This arrived out of its original packaging. The beader itself was faded - almost yellow on top - looking as if it had sat in a store window with the sun beating down on it for months and months. It had clearly been taken out of the original package and just dumped into a clear plastic bag. Terrible presentation and not worthy to be given as a gift, which is what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> my daughter only uses on her barbies gems are hard to get out of her hair</li>
    <li> This is great-my daughter looks for reasons to use and wear the quick gems!</li>
    <li> Great product, the girls had a blast with it.  Real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the jeweler once you take them out of your hair.  Great fun for girls who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled!  Although it kinds of pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out of your hair.  Not all the time though.  Still a fabulous product.  Would highly recommend it.  My niece wishes it came with more gems.</li>
    <li> My 8 and 10-year old daughters received this for Christmas. It works great. The gems stay in. My daughters have fine, thin hair and everything slides out except for these jewels. The girls are having a lot of fun with it.</li>
    <li> this product does not deserve the one star.  it deserves no stars.  piece of junk!!! it annoys me to pay shipping to even return this.  worth nothing, does not work, cheap piece of plastic, opened package all the beads fell on the floor, what a hoax.  stay away from this toy worth 1 penny.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my niece who was turning 7. She loves it and has been using it often. I did warn her Mom about potentially having difficulty getting the gems out, but apparently they haven&#x27;t had that problem. My niece does have curly hair (we are are Indian), but it&#x27;s not been a problem to get the gems out. I bought some extra gems to make it more fun.</li>
    <li> Works really good but soon you&#x27;ll find out you need more of this little things.So I would suggest to buy replacement pck at the same time.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this it is so cute and such a great way to spice up my daughters hair routine- but it fell apart the first day and despite being a conair product it really is poorly made and not worth the money</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift but the packaging is so cheesy I&#x27;d be embarrassed to put my name on the card. It&#x27;s going back and I&#x27;m going to the mall where I can see what I&#x27;m getting.When will I learn?</li>
    <li> I remember when I first saw this advertised on tv when I was a kid. I&#x27;ve always wanted it ever since, but I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store! I&#x27;m glad it was available on Amazon! This is a very cool toy, and I was very happy when I got it in the mail!! I would recommend this product to anyone who likes to style hair!!</li>
    <li> This is an ok hair product. My daughters love the idea of it but the gems don&#x27;t stay as well as I had hoped. This is definitely for indoor play only. Several gems fell out while the girls were walking around. The replacement pieces arena little more expensive than I had hoped. Especially for plastic and a spring. All in all, it&#x27;s worth it for little girls playing dress up and wanting to have fun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s total junk, but I&#x27;m not at all impressed. Arrived without any box, just wrapped in a plastic bag. It&#x27;s not simple to use and requires some patience as well as some skill in figuring it out. The hair charms are awfully large and cheap looking. Not quite what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> This is a really cute hair accesory. It took a while for me to get the hang of how much hair to put in to get the gems to look good.  My 5 year old daughter loves it!  I wish it had come with more hair gems or at the very least how you could order replacements.  You definately need more gems than the ones that come with the Conair jeweler</li>
    <li> Product was a must have Gift from Santa.  My daughter loves it but for the price it was a splurge.  Had it not been for Christmas  I would not have paid that amount.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old niece loved it.  It&#x27;s not messy, easy to use and adds the extra bling she loves.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! It is easy to use and easy to refill the gems. I received my order promptly.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use but the jewels fall out if you don&#x27;t get a large enough section of hair.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is having a blast decorating her hair with this gem jeweler.  I also bought a refill pack to make sure there are always enough jewels to decorate her hair with.  the jeweler is easy to use, she can manage it herself, adds the jewels right were she wants them, doesn&#x27;t tangle her hair and it is overall a cool product for a young girl who loves fixing her hair.</li>
    <li> The concept is great, however the jewels will not stay on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She resorted to putting them on the doll and the pieces  fall off after playing with it for a while.</li>
    <li> my daughter has not yet used it but her friend has the same thing and she uses it everysday for school all her friends say that her hair looks beautiful.</li>
    <li> I was out shopping over the summer and happened to see this product on an endcap of the linen store (BB&amp;B).  It was priced on clearance for $4, but I quickly looked up online reviews for it, since I had never heard of this product before.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; price of the product was significantly higher and that it had gotten great reviews.  So I purchased it and hid it away for 2 months, awaiting my daughter&#x27;s 7th birthday.  Well, I just gave it to her and she loves it.  She wanted them in her hair, even though it was almost bed time.  Since I don&#x27;t know how well these stay in overnight and the \\&quot;refills\\&quot; cost more than 4x what I paid for the unit, I told her we&#x27;d have to take them back out before going to bed.  She wanted to try it out anyhow.  I&#x27;m terrible with doing anything but brushing hair, but even being so inept, I was able to figure this tool out quickly.  My daughter was able to almost do it herself, but did need a bit of help positioning her hair.  That&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s nice mother/daughter time.  And I have no doubt that it won&#x27;t be long before she gets it figured out on her own.  I was nervous about how difficult it would be to remove the gems, but they came out very easily with reading the directions on the best way to remove them.  It took maybe 5 minutes to fill up her hair with the pre-loaded gems (the unit has a few extras and I actually put those away to use as \\&quot;replacements\\&quot; for when we inevitably wind up losing some), and then when we were ready to remove the gems, it took maybe another 5 minutes.  My daughter has some sensory issues and can&#x27;t stand her hair being pulled, like when we have to remove a pony tail holder, but removal of the gems didn&#x27;t pull on her hair at all.  I would definitely recommend this product.  And even at the price listed on amazon, I would consider purchasing it again to give out as birthday gifts.</li>
    <li> Item looks like fun however does not work as easy as seen on TV. Gems are just as easily added and removed by hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 7year old niece. She loved it. She used a few times and thought it was cool. .She was able to do it herself!</li>
