      <li>No smell- which is great for me.</li>
      <li>keep doing it, it&#x27;s great</li>

      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>excellent quality, organic, very well priced.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t report on this yet, order is nice, goes on face nice, not overly greasy, absorbs into skin..will continue to use.</li>
      <li>highly recommend!  :D</li>
      <li>This by far is the best value.</li>
      <li>This did not break me out and it absorbs quickly into the skin nicely!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>My hair is softer and the ends more manageable.</li>
      <li>] product.  :)</li>

      <li>My skin&#x27;s condition is getting better.</li>
      <li>Love this product so much!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really great, natural product.</li>
      <li>of this reason, I interested in it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t know this effective, I&#x27;m using this product from now.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and fine hair and no particular problems</li>
      <li>I am 33 and still have mild acne and tend toward oily skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Having tried and fell in love with the \\&quot;Shine On\\&quot; my next natural step was to do additional products.  :)</li>
      <li>After I used it, my hair got very soft and smooth.</li>

      <li>This argan oil is great-and is pure with no scent at all which is far better than similar brands around</li>
      <li>very nourishing, no scent, not greasy unless you use too much.  </li>
      <li>Hair does feel softer but this can be accomplished with drugstore conditioner a a fraction of the price</li>
      <li>I add some to my body wash and my wen hair care products and it really hydrates both my skin and hair.</li>
      <li>I would really recommend it.</li>
      <li>skin looks much healthier.</li>
      <li>Just a drop of this oil can make a whole difference.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>super beneficial to growing out long hair!</li>
      <li>other comments have stated, softens the hair very much for me indeed!  </li>
      <li>Every year from Thanksgiving to St. Patrick&#x27;s Day my face is in full on, tight, shiny, flaky, I miss 90% humidity revolt.</li>
      <li>I will continue using it, maybe things will get better after a couple more months, but for now, I am a bit disappointed.</li>

<li> , this oil doesn&#x27;t live up to those claims, maybe just not right for me, or maybe just not a quality oil and overpriced, 2oz for 30 is a ton of money, I have heard coconut oil unrefined woks</li>
<li> I wear it all day and all night long.</li>
<li> Can already see some improvement results on dry, flaky skin problem.</li>
<li> Feels Greasy when applied to face and doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin used 2 little drops, barely put any in hair and feels greasy after 4hrs,</li>
<li> I only used a few drops, both on the skin and hair.</li>
<li> , I was just curious to try it out.</li>
<li> At this price I feel it isn&#x27;t what I expected, people keep saying these oils have a nutty smell</li>
<li> So it works the way like other people saying.</li>
<li> a little goes a long way!  </li>
<li> In the dead of winter when my skin was very dry I used this and the John Masters Organics Pomegranate Oil together.</li>
<li> You need very little, &amp; it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> slight vinegar smell that goes away, bottle claims product is pressed by hand, however no instructions for uses or how to use.</li>
<li> My hair got very dry and hard at that time.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s pure organic argan oil &amp; the least expensive.</li>
<li> Need to use very little.  </li>
<li> but it is less than half the price!!!  </li>
<li> I usually spend the $50</li>
<li> duh, wheres the miracle every ones talking about?</li>

    <li> No smell- which is great for me. Leaves hair moisturized but not greasy. Best Argan oil I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! it&#x27;s great! I add some to my body wash and my wen hair care products and it really hydrates both my skin and hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Need to use very little.  My hair is softer and the ends more manageable. Use only after drying hair. Use only on ends.</li>
    <li> this Argan oil I know will change my life, actually I am feeling the difference on my skin. I am using it at night.&lt;br /&gt;Jhon keep doing it, it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the \\&quot;Argan Oil\\&quot; complimented by the \\&quot;Shine On\\&quot; [[ASIN:B005MINRV4 B005MINRV4]] product.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried and fell in love with the \\&quot;Shine On\\&quot; my next natural step was to do additional products.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other comments have stated, softens the hair very much for me indeed!  :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!  :D</li>
    <li> Feels Greasy when applied to face and doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin used 2 little drops, barely put any in hair and feels greasy after 4hrs, slight vinegar smell that goes away, bottle claims product is pressed by hand, however no instructions for uses or how to use. At this price I feel it isn&#x27;t what I expected, people keep saying these oils have a nutty smell and they absorb into the skin immediately, this oil doesn&#x27;t live up to those claims, maybe just not right for me, or maybe just not a quality oil and overpriced, 2oz for 30 is a ton of money, I have heard coconut oil unrefined woks well too so may be trying that next, oil is oil, you put it on your skin and make your skin oily duh, wheres the miracle every ones talking about? Hair does feel softer but this can be accomplished with drugstore conditioner a a fraction of the price, coconut oils cheap too 5.99 or less for 16 oz, also works well for back massage and smells good, hmm kinda a wast of money if you ask me. I&#x27;m gonna give it a week and see what happens.</li>
    <li> Just started using the product a couple days ago. Can already see some improvement results on dry, flaky skin problem.</li>
    <li> this product is winner(No.1) by @cosme of department hair-care in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;becaouse of this reason, I interested in it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t know this effective, I&#x27;m using this product from now.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks much healthier.</li>
    <li> i use the product on my hair and scalp.  a little goes a long way!  very nourishing, no scent, not greasy unless you use too much.  super beneficial to growing out long hair!</li>
    <li> This argan oil is great-and is pure with no scent at all which is far better than similar brands around</li>
    <li> I usually spend the $50+  on the Josie Maran Argan oil but while watching a youtube video a makeup guru recommended this.. not only does it work the same as the josie maran argan oil but it is less than half the price!!!  This did not break me out and it absorbs quickly into the skin nicely! Highly recommend! Will repurchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because of the huge publicity and awesome reviews that abound. I have fair skin and fine hair and no particular problems I was trying to solve with this oil, I was just curious to try it out. I was just hoping my skin would look maybe younger and glowing. I have now added it to my daily skin care routine and I used it weekly on my hair for about a month now. I only used a few drops, both on the skin and hair. On the hair only on the lower third.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using it, the only thing I noticed is that the skin looks brighter and tighter, but only 10-15 min, after applying it. On the hair, I didn&#x27;t notice anything (my hair is just the same as before, not stronger, not more brilliant). While it doesn&#x27;t hurt applying it, I haven&#x27;t noticed big changes. I will continue using it, maybe things will get better after a couple more months, but for now, I am a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> My skin&#x27;s condition is getting better. I believe its the oil. Really great, natural product. I would really recommend it.</li>
    <li> You can use this product for your hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was damaged and had many spilt ends.  Just a drop of this oil can make a whole difference.</li>
    <li> I got this because I saw good review from a website. My hair got very dry and hard at that time. After I used it, my hair got very soft and smooth. So it works the way like other people saying.</li>
    <li> excellent quality, organic, very well priced. there are alot of argan oil products out there. This by far is the best value. It&#x27;s pure organic argan oil &amp; the least expensive. You need very little, &amp; it lasts a long time. wonderful moisturizer for the face, hair,skin,cuticles.</li>
    <li> Came in time, item was what I wanted. Love it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t report on this yet, order is nice, goes on face nice, not overly greasy, absorbs into skin..will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I am 33 and still have mild acne and tend toward oily skin. I grew up in the tropics but am now living in the Midwest and my skin hates the climate. Especially the skin on my face. Every year from Thanksgiving to St. Patrick&#x27;s Day my face is in full on, tight, shiny, flaky, I miss 90% humidity revolt. I wear it all day and all night long. It has not made me breakout and I can use it under make up without feeling greasy. I use it on my scalp and hair too. In the dead of winter when my skin was very dry I used this and the John Masters Organics Pomegranate Oil together. I wasn&#x27;t dewy, but I was damn close.</li>
