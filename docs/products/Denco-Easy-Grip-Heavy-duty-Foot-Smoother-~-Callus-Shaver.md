<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this along with the liquid callous remover. I have had this used on my feet in the salons. I wanted to do it on my own at home and to according to my frequency without have to a pay for a $30 pedicure in the salon. This product is gentle easy to use and removes the dead skin quickly. However used to often can remove too much skin and cause soreness or bleeding. Needs to be used after a shower or foot soak.</li>
    <li> we have purchased these files from another source for years, and never had a problem. I don&#x27;t know if these are a copy or if they offer different qualities. These were not the quality we are used to getting with Denco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a good 6 months and probably use it once every other week or two. It really helps get the dead skin off without tearing up your feet. It&#x27;s easy to use with the long handle. I usually only use the coarse side but the fine side works good too for smoothing out the skin.</li>
    <li> it worked really good at first but now it is like it has lost its sharpness for me and doesnt work as well</li>
    <li> This foot smoother is something like a cheese grater, with your foot as the cheese. It really gets rid of a lot of dead skin and does wonders for cracked heels. Use it after a shower or bath because your skin has to be wet for the smoother to work well.</li>
    <li> Item handle has good length an grip. Proforated blade should be more sharper to remove more callus, however works well.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many products for my crusty feet. I have pretty much a whole foot salon drawer full of lotions, creams, and devices. I don&#x27;t know if it will hold up in the long run or go dull but right now it is my go to item! Its so convenient to use in shower, wet or dry and works way better than the ped-egg. Easier to hold and no need to rinse. I wish I knew this product existed before I have wasted so much money on useless products!!!!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine got a flesh eating bacteria from a salon back in 06.  After watching her go through the pain, creams and shots. The scars on her legs for years. I&#x27;ve only let few trusted give me a Pedicure. I know this bacteria thing is said to be rare, but I am not screwing around with taking chances. It was horrible what she went through with that. This Smoother does everything it claims and exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve had the Egg, Every pumice rock, ridge, stick, scrubber, puffer, electric smoother, foot bath with attachments ect. Nothing has ever made my feet so smooth and pretty. After a nice soak, bath or long shower. Just rub the yucky stuff off.. when needed. Clean up and set aside to dry off. It&#x27;s so easy it&#x27;s ridiculous. I plan to buy for my loved ones this holiday season :) I might even get me a spare for traveling.</li>
    <li> item works great. no need to add expensive callus treatment to my salon pedicures. i also bought the callus eliminator &amp; didnt need it .</li>
    <li> I have looked forever to find the same one used in the salons and this is it! It works better than I thought it would. I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer mentioned, my scratchy heels would always make snagging sounds on my silky duvet cover.  Not any more!  I was so excited to try this after I received it!  I have used it on dry feet and slightly damp feet, and it works both ways.  I just use it while I sit on the edge of the tub and then I rinse the dead skin mess down with some water when I am done.  I have rubbed very aggressively, and I never have any discomfort afterwards...just smooth skin!  I loved it so much that I recommended it to my sister!  Definitely worth the $!</li>
    <li> Honestly, this is the most effective dead skin remover ever. Way better than that Ped Egg crap, pumice stones that take forever to show any effect, or worse those corn remover blades that can put you in the hospital. This was safe, easy and quick. I havent had to replace mine yet, so I wonder if the thing ever goes dull. I highly enjoy this product.</li>
    <li> If you this especially on dry heels, you still should a foot file to smooth out the heel.  Haven&#x27;t used it much..</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a great product. You are better off with a Titania angled pumice sponge for less than  $5.</li>
    <li> I liked it. Make sure you use it just after a bath or shower, when your skin is softer and is removed easier. Works much better than a blade. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a foot smoother for years, and this is the best one! So easy to use and effective, yet gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this was not what I expected but it served it&#x27;s purpose.  Will not purchase again but would recommend it but better smoothers are out there.</li>
    <li> For years I have had the most horrible (really horrible) heels! If something worked it only worked a little and it wouldn&#x27;t take long to get even worse.  I tried the Pedegg so mamy times (dozens and dozens) and it only tore the skin and left it jagged.  I have soaked until my feet should have shriveled up.  I have tried scrapers, razor blades, creams, creams with socks, vaseline, special heel creams guaranteed to work (and didn&#x27;t) and on and on.  But if you have horrible heels you will know. Once I got into my sixties it became embarrassing to say the least.  So I decided to give this device a try.  I had also ordered some kind of an acid eating callus remover but I  did not have to use that scarey stuff!  This device can be used dry or wet. I first soaked in Epson Salts and hot water. Started using this thing and cripes it was taking off the yucky skin/callous.  It was fantastic.  Not perfect but impressive.  I did not have jaggedy pieces of skin like I got with the Pedegg.  Each morning I use this thing a little bit and a time and in just a few days my heels are gorgeous!! They look like they did in my 30&#x27;s!!  The tilted handle makes in so easy to use! Two sides to it, one more fine than the other and I used that to \\&quot;finish\\&quot; as it smooths it out.  All in all I know some folks are not impressed but I sure am.  So is my husband by the way.  He was just as annoyed as I was since my heels were terrible looking and scratchy! We both love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I still love this item. The only problem I have is that after a reasonable number of uses it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well, even though it is rinsed off and free of skin debris.  Some folks mention the lifetime warranty. Well that is only true in that you can contact Denco according to my understanding. I have searched a long time and cannot come up with a way to contact the company. But, in any case, because it works so great for a period of time I just buy another one.  Nothing else helps my heels like this!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2/22/13:  I have gotten tired of buying a new one after a dozen uses.  As I said, I washed and rinsed it off and just at a point it just \\&quot;roughs\\&quot; up my feet making the skin kind of raggedy.  So, I started using a friends idea.  Sandpaper !  Yep, smooths my heels fantastically and costs a bunch less.</li>
    <li> This Denco file is the best file I have ever used. I wish I would have discovered it years ago. This file, along with Be Natural Dry Heel Eliminator, has transformed my winter feet!</li>
    <li> This works well for someone with slightly calloused feet, but mine are very bad and it doesn&#x27;t make much of a dent.  It might work better if I used some sort of callous remover.</li>
    <li> works well, wish it came with the addition of a smaller one with it, this ones a bit big and hard to get into some of the intricate parts of the foot (underside of big toe joint). Other then that, its as described</li>
    <li> I was skeptical reading the various reviews. Had lost the two \\&quot;sandpaper\\&quot; type callous removers.   I was thrilled to find this works better than anything I have ever used!!! And I used it on dry skin. I bought the callous softener but frankly that&#x27;s a  lot of bother for me so I tried it on dry feet - the way I had used my other now lost products. It removed my calloused skin on my feet very quickly and efficiently. I couldn&#x27;t be happier - except wish it came in a plastic sleeve/case.</li>
    <li> This foot grater is well made and feels very nice in your hand. It works well on heels and everywhere this rather large foot smoother can access. Use on towel-dried feet after soaking. I needed an additional smaller foot file to access some stubborn calluses just behind the second toe. But for larger areas, a very nice file.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I bought this despite all of the great reviews, but wow, this does what the Ped Egg is supposed to do. Btw, the Ped Egg is awful. It did not remove anything and was a waste of money. Highly, highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have always been embarrassed by the cracked heals and calluses on my feet.  I was born and raised in Florida and was almost always barefoot.  It took its toll on my feet...  Using the Be Natural Callus Eliminator and this shaver in combination is better (way better) than any pedicure I have ever paid for!  I was skeptical about spending 15.00 on a foot file, but not any more.  I might be buying these for my sisters :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I found less than wonderful about this file is that the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; side is recessed into the frame so only a small portion of it is truly usable.  It doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me that they would do this, but I am still in love with the file.  I don&#x27;t know why it works SO MUCH BETTER than the other 10 or 12 I have owned in my life, but it does!</li>
    <li> Purchased this one as a gift because a friend saw mine and saw how well it worked on my feet so I ordered one for her. She loves it! I&#x27;ve had mine for years and it has worked wonders on my feet. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I do not usually write reviews but I have to say this product is really good.  It really took down some dry rough spots on my foot as well as my husbands. I would highly recommend this for softening up rough feet.  I found it best to use on dry feet. You get a little workout.  I would suggest using a damp towel under it though as this product doesn&#x27;t collect shavings.  That didn&#x27;t bother me though.  The only downfall I found to this was it wore out really quick.  Although I can still use it, it has dulled and doesn&#x27;t do as well.  It&#x27;s supposed to be lifetime warranty, so was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t remain sharper for more than a month or so.</li>
    <li> This foot smoother works great. I have bad feet from dancing ballet for ten years when I was a kid. This product smoothes out my feet quickly because it has a large scraping surface so I can get alot of area done at a time. It doesn&#x27;t leave holes or rough edges on on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and I use it every two/three days but could use it everyday without irritation. It is a rough and smooth surface all on one side so you don&#x27;t have to waste your time using one side to remove and one side to smooth. It does it all at the same time. It doesn&#x27;t have any sand paper material that comes off after awhile which is great because those scrapers do not last and are not sanitary after a short period of time unless properly sterilized (who has time for that). The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the plastic surrounding the scraper is thick so I can&#x27;t get the parts of my toes that bend (inside knuckle). It works so good everywhere else though that I don&#x27;t care. I will update this in time to come if it becomes dull or rusty (I leave in shower).</li>
    <li> very glad i bought this. it works wonders! i really dont know what else to say about it, other than dont use lotion or water on your feet when you scrub them.</li>
    <li> The quality and effectiveness of this product is truly amazing (especially for the price). This thing actually does what it advertises, it removes the excess dead skin and leaves the good healthy skin alone (doesn&#x27;t even irritate it). A quality product for a great price that actually does exactly what it advertises it does...you just can&#x27;t ask for more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 3-30-13. Well, it doesn&#x27;t last a lifetime like they say. It does get dull and begin to remove less and less calleous skin. So you do have to replace these after a year or two(depending how much/often you use it). But they are so cheap, that I am not going to hold that against it.</li>
    <li> I love using this.  It&#x27;s easy and effective.  The effects lasted for about a week.  Highly recommended!  Great for do it yourself pedicures.</li>
    <li> Broke after one week :( And tried to return but they would not let me</li>
    <li> Tears up your feet and leaves them worse!!!</li>
    <li> It worked well, while it lasted. Unfortunately the metal part broke and the seller would not replace it. I tried to contact the manufacturer as the seller directed, but neither the website nor the phone number the seller provided worked. The metal filing part is a very, very thin piece of metal, and the flexing it sustained while I used it caused the metal to break. I can&#x27;t recommend it for this reason. It worked well while it lasted, but it broke after only normal usage.</li>
    <li> OMG, I love this thing!  I am usually difficult to please, but this item is wonderful.  After first it did not seem to work well.  The problem was that I drying my feet too much, after taking shower or soaking my feet.  Now after taking a shower or soaking my feet, I lightly dry my feet, I immediately use this Foot Smoother and all this crusty and yucky stuff rolls off!  After first I thought $18 is a lot of money for this tool, but considering I recently paid $70 for a manicure AND a pedicure, I figured, why not try this.  From now on, I am going to use this every other day just a little bit, and I am sure in about a month, my feet will be sandals ready!  I am going to give one to my girlfriend who loves getting pedicures but hates paying the heavy duty prices at the spas!</li>
    <li> A very well made product that is complimentary to and can be used with most liquid callus removers. Does a better job than the high end ceramic smoother I have been using for the last 3 years. Though, you may consider such smoother for a \\&quot;final touch\\&quot; as the Denco only has a medium and coarse surface. Overall, the results are excellent.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this foot smoother for me and it does a great job.  I gave it three stars because the advertisement is misleading.  It is supposed to have a lifetime warranty, but after a few months, the metal part grew dull with usage and we had to get a new one since it didn&#x27;t leave the soles smooth.  By the way, I get pedicures monthly so I really do not have very rough and callused soles.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 of these.  I gave one to my nail tech who couldn&#x27;t seem to find one through her normal supply house.  She was thrilled , and so was I since I also benefit from this fine product.  It&#x27;s tough on calluses and dry skin without hurting the feet.</li>
    <li> I have bought many foot and callous removers in the past but this one is fantastic. At last I have smooth heels and look good in sandals. I would recommend this product  to anyone with rough skin</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s late at night and you are nestled comfortably in the folds of your comforter...ouch!  Your calluses snag on the threads of your bedding.  Gross.  Thus the mission was born to locate a solution for this nasty little problem.  I have had my calluses removed whilst getting a pedicure but I decided I could no longer show my face in that  institution after watching all of that skin roll off of my feet.  Then I found this wonderful little tool.  I tried it out in conjunction with \\&quot;Callus Eliminator 4 oz.\\&quot; (you must absolutely try this product).  Now I actually get a little giddy about crawling under my comforter and will even be so brave as to sleep on top of it!      This tool is a solid tool and does the job of sanding away dead skin beautifully.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t losing sleep over the appearance of my feet, but I did have a bit of a problem with dead skin accumulating on the bottoms of my heels.  It takes less than 5 minutes per week to dispense with that little issue thanks to this product.  It is brilliantly simple and effective!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best foot treatment I have ever had!  This doesn&#x27;t even compare to pumice stones.  I admit, my feet were in pretty bad shape, but this foot smoother did more than I imagined it would.  It is the perfect shape to get the entire heel and all over the foot.  My feet have never felt so smooth.  I used this on dry skin.  My only slight complaint is that it does leave white skin powder behind.  I will use this outside the next time.  I scraped pretty hard to remove the tougher spots and there was absolutely no pain.  My feet are now summer ready!  Thanks Denco! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It clearly states that the item ships for free to APO/FPO addresses, but when I tried to order it to b shipped to my APO address it came back and said it could not ship to my location.  Disappointed to say the least.</li>
    <li> This product is great for constant pedicures, but it is not good for tough calluses. I recommend for maintenance only.</li>
    <li> Wow!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this foot smoother!  I have searched high and low and tried out so many different products in my mission for smooth feet.  Look no further!  This item is so awesome!  My feet felt smooth after the very first time.  It doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling rough like some other products - which require you to then use something else to smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t have a backing that prevents you from cleaning it so it will last much longer.  I mean, it is awesome!  My husband of 5 years actually randomly commented the other night - \\&quot;Wow, your feet are soft!\\&quot;  He has never commented on my feet like that before.  Enough said!  :)</li>
    <li> I live in Hawaii and wear slippers almost everyday. My heals were just disgusting, deep painful cracks all over the heal and it was just embarrassing and nasty. I&#x27;ve tried razors and other sorts of filers but nothing seemed to do the trick. After reading all the positive reviews here I decided to give this a try. I bought it along with the \\&quot;be natural callus eliminator\\&quot; and I must say, my heals are now gorgeous. This filer just shaves off the dead skin so easily. If you have hideous calluses like I did, I recommend you get the callus eliminator as well, it makes the job ten times easier because the calluses and dead skin just melt off.</li>
    <li> These are great gifts for friends and family! I love mine and they last. They really are heavy duty.</li>
    <li> I need to really scrub my foot because my corn builds up really fast. I used to own a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot scrub but it does not come close to this foot smoother at all....this is by far the best foot scrub I have....it has the mild sandy paper texture yet not abrasive enough to damage your skin...it&#x27;s good, it works and it is highly recommended....</li>
    <li> This foot \\&quot;smoother\\&quot; works like a charm &#x3D;)  It looked a little menacing out of the package, but it&#x27;s pretty gentle on the feet.  I think the press they used to make the holes in mine was on one of its last presses when mine was made because the holes in the metal weren&#x27;t perfectly cut.  There holes are indented a little from the press not being sharp enough and look like they&#x27;d scrape a little rough but I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems.  I&#x27;m only giving it four stars in hope that somebody from the company reads this and they start changing out the press more often for better product quality.</li>
    <li> Denco Easy Grip Foot Smoother: When I 1st got it in the mail I wasn&#x27;t that impressed, but today for the 1st time I finally used it, and it works pretty good. I&#x27;ve been using this cheese grater file thing that works pretty good too. But I spend about 25 min&#x27;s with that thing on both feet, and since it takes so long I tend to put it off. This one seems to work much faster. This is only my 1st time using it but so far so good, and it&#x27;s true that you hardly feel it while you&#x27;re scraping your feet. The only down side that I&#x27;ve noticed so far is that unlike the other file that I&#x27;ve always used, like someone else mentioned in a previous review, this one doesn&#x27;t collect the dead skin so it goes all over the place. Also I like to see how much dead skin has accumulated after I file my feet for I can have a sense of what I&#x27;m doing and how much my feet needed it... I give this product four stars instead of five only because I only have used it once, but it may very well be a 5 star for me but I&#x27;ll know that with future use.</li>
    <li> This is the best foot scrubber I have ever purchased and it&#x27;s effective on both dry and wet feet. My super rough heels are incredibly improved after just 2 weeks of using this scrubber. Sweet results!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my Mother she loves it so she can reach and get rid of those callouses&lt;br /&gt;try it you will like it</li>
    <li> I received my product very quickly. It was packaged well and it works amazing! I thought it would be one of those rough scrappers where you foot is left uneven, but its not at all. After I am done, there is only smooth skin. May take a little pressure and time, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Nice but ....pricey...at 15.95...Denco Easy Grip Professional Foot Smoother ~ Callus Shaver ~ w/Lifetime Warranty...Works fine for the one rough patch on my right foot.</li>
    <li> I am accustomed to being disappointed when it comes to tools like these. In the past I&#x27;ve either had pumice stone that slips from my grasp or breaks off the cheap handle. I&#x27;ve had callus shavers that reminded me of cheese graters and did more damage than good; they also became blunt really quickly. Needless to say, I was apprehensive when I ordered this.  I received it a few days ago and gave it a try, only to find that it was a really smooth process that caused no injury. It&#x27;s well designed, and whilst I do not how it will fare with time, works extremely well.  I will be purchasing one for my mother.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It keeps the callous that I have on my feet at bay. This is exactly what the nail salon uses on my feet, and I am happy that I found it!</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS WONDERS ON MY HUSBANDS FEET. COMBINED IT WITH THE CALLUS REMOVER LOTION AND IT IS GREAT. MAKES MY LIFE EASIER AND SAVES IS MONEY SO WE DONT HAVE TO GO TO THE SALON.</li>
    <li> This device works well, is good quality, and gets the job done.  Note that mine says course and medium (not course and fine as listed here).  You simply flip it over for the course or medium grate.  This thing is a bit like a cheese grater, but it works well.  I was surprised how well.  The handle is nice, making this easier to hold and use than many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mainly for my cracked heels and it has helped a lot.  I use this cream ([[ASIN:B0013H8M5E Flexitol Heel Balm, 4 oz.]]) as well and between them have things under control.</li>
    <li> My skin feels smooth after use. The course side is very easy to use. The medium side is awkward because the plastic frame is thicker on that side so it gets in the way. It would be the perfect product if it was not designed like that.</li>
    <li> ..foot file product I&#x27;ve used.. And I think I&#x27;ve tried them all.     For those of you a little confused as to exactly what this is from the picture, like I was.. It&#x27;s a metal foil with a rough surface that has holes. The holes are crucial for a product of this type because it allows the dead and smoothed away skin a place to exit. The problem with many such products is they clog easily, making them less effective or require extensive cleaning while using them.    Not this one. The dead skin exits the holes and a quick swish in some water and it&#x27;s completely clean again. I also never noticed it getting clogged while in use. It&#x27;s far superior to the ped egg, and doesn&#x27;t tear up your feet like the effective, but very rough and prone to clogging foot files.    Used with a liquid callus remover product, like &#x27;be natural&#x27; callus remover, you can solve almost any callus or rough and dry skin foot problem, and provide yourself with a professional pedicure for pennies on the dollar compared to a salon.     Remember this doesn&#x27;t cure fungus problems, so if you suspect that, follow up with some sort of anti-fungal cream like Lamisil or the generic equivalent.    The lifetime guarantee is nice as well.    I&#x27;ve dealt with this company before and have a pair of their excellent, and wonderfully designed nose hair trimmers. I can&#x27;t recommend them enough.    This product works fine dry for general foot smoothing purposes, but like most pedicure products really shines after a shower or brief soaking, which softens up your callouses somewhat. So, if you have a heavy duty problem, like others suggest, use after you&#x27;ve soaked your feet or after a shower.    The company that produces this product (Denco) also has a heavy duty version that has a thicker foil, but it has the same grit as this one, so it isn&#x27;t necessarily anymore effective. I suspect it was produced for the pedicure market. This one is practically identical and fine for home use, and is less expensive.    Again this is a great product, and the best one I&#x27;ve used on my hard core, and hard charging feet. Yes I&#x27;m a guy. And no, I no relationship with this company whatsoever. I just developed a dry, rough, cracked foot problem in my 40&#x27;s, due mostly to heredity and neglect and got tired of just living with it.    Buy it.</li>
    <li> I like this product because you are able to hold it with a steady grip and really get that dead skin off your heels</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous items trying to get rid of the thick ugly calluses on my feet.  This works and it works with little effort.  Buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I read the opinions on this product and figured if the product was half as good as other reviewers claimed, it would be worth a try.       Before the Denco easy Grip Foot Smoother, I needed a pedicure once a month to shave off the callous on the soles and heels of my feet.  The cracks in the callous split to the live flesh below and caused pain and bleeding.  After a month of use, the splits are substantially reduced and feet are much more comfortable.      So much for the testimonial, now a description of the product.    There are two sides to this.  One medium and the other course.  The medium side is recessed in the holder and the opposite course side is more fully exposed to allow some serious removal of callous material.  The holes are punched so as to allow removal of dead skin from the surface.  The holes also function on the course side as an added scraping surface, as there is a very slight edge on the holes facing the course side.      The handle is ergonomically shaped and bends slightly toward the course side to allow excellent grip and more pressure during use on the course side of the foot smoother.      The cost of the unit is about the price of a foot massage in my region of the country and while I will continue to have pedicures, my feet are in much better shape due to the use of this item.    BTW, I have also used a variety of other methods including foot razors, graters, stones, etc.  None work as well as the Denco.</li>
    <li> Given the reviews here, I thought that this was exactly what I needed. It arrived and I soaked my feet and put it to use. Almost nothing came of it. Pumice is so much better. Almost anything is better. It took a tiny bit of callous off with a great deal of effort. If one had very little callous and you wanted to polish your feet, this may be your ticket. If you want a good workout, this may be your ticket. If you want to blow $20, this is perfect. If you have real callouses, try something else.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful purchase for anyone who needs a little help or a lot of help with their feet.  Both my husband and I have been using tools for our feet for years.  My husbands feet have never been so smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I got this because it was reccomended as I was buying my Callus eliminator and callus remover lotion.    I owned a ped egg, and this is so much better.  The egg really feels like its shredding skin, this does not it just gently polishes it away.  I really like it    My only complaint is you need to do this over a towel or the tub or something, or you do end up with dead skin all over which is really kinda gross, but other wise I great and easy to clean.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used the &amp;#34;egg&amp;#34; foot smoother, but was never very happy with it.  The Denco&lt;br /&gt;foot smoother works very well, is convenient, and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This shaver has a comfortable rubber grip on the handle so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hands easily when using it in the shower. This shaver works great with a solution I also bought from Amazon in the &amp;#34;recommended&amp;#34; section.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Does not need too much force to shave all callus from feet. Worth the price you pay for. Very much happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> For some reason -- they must make two different kinds of Denco Easy Grip Professional Foot Smoother -- because this ISN&#x27;T like the one at the spa I go to.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for foot smoother for a long time.  Ordered last weeks, and got 2 days later.  I tried it immediately, and it works the wonder.  The rough skin on my feet really bothers me especially when I wear sandals.  THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT.  I plan to order more as gift to my friends.  it is summer time, and we want pretty feet out.</li>
    <li> This is the answer to rough heels.  Forget all of those creams, etc...just use this in the shower every other day or so, and you will be amazed.</li>
    <li> My favorite nail salon uses these and I just knew I needed to have one. This thing is amazing and works like a charm. I only soaked my feet for about 5-7 minutes and the dead skin came off very easily and with minimal effort compared to other callous removers I&#x27;ve tried. I usually use products like Callus Eliminator before trying to file my feet down, but with this thing I didn&#x27;t even need to use those. I would highly recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s perfect for those who don&#x27;t want to spend money at the nail salon or for those that want something to keep their feet neat between pedicures.</li>
    <li> easy to use,..long handle for good reach,..really pain free buffs out the callouses,...Happy I bought it. Totally does the trick</li>
    <li> this really does the job. I had so much dry, and hard cracked heels, and dry callouses, and i bought this product hopeing it would do the job. i was afraid at first because my heels were so dry and rough. But i got my feet wet to the point where the cracked heel area was soft, and i started useing the product, and it took me several times to where it was completely off. it takes about 10 mins to get everything off for me. but it was all worth it bc my feet are so smooth, and i love it! my feet have never really looked this smooth before. if you want smooth feet all around, get this product!</li>
    <li> Living near the ocean, I walk on the beach a lot. The sand can leave your feet quite rough, but this handy tool makes smoothing out the rough spots very easy. It&#x27;s like giving yourself a pedicure!</li>
    <li> Works well. No problems.</li>
    <li> The Easy Grip Professional Foot Smoother is the best product.  I have used all types, many very expensive, of foot smoothers but none can compare to this product.  The Easy Grip Foot Smoother beats the PedEgg hands down.  (And, I think the PedEgg is a very good product). You will never have to replace the blade on the Foot Smoother as on the PedEgg.  No need for the skin irritating callus gels or lotions. It is simple to use, easy to clean and works!  A very professional and well-made product that will last a lifetime.     [[ASIN:B000J45DTU Easy Grip Professional Foot Smoother - Lifetime Warranty + Free Shipping]]</li>
    <li> Very fine openings leave callouses smooth.  Some products are very rough &amp; leave lines in your skin, not this one.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product I have ever used for my callus&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve been softening my feet, heals especially for the past few days with aquaphor &amp; used the callus shaver yesterday &amp; today &amp; it is unbelievable how smooth my feet are.  I had horrible callus&#x27;s &amp; hard skin.  Now my feet look even better then when I get a professional pedicure.  Feels great &amp; no chance of cutting skin.  This product will be a stocking stuffer for all my girlfriends next Christmas.  This product should be in every pedicure station.</li>
    <li> Not a good tool for serious callus&#x27;, if you have a large area that needs serious grinding this won&#x27;t do the job, it is great for minor callus&#x27; but i had a serious job to do on my heel and this didn&#x27;t take off the needed skin</li>
    <li> Worked great for awhile, but I must not know my own strength because the handle broke after a few months of scraping.  I will say that before it broke, it worked great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many other types of smoothers on my feet, among those the Egg, callus scraper with a blade, electric buffer, and many other hand-held files.  My feet were in horrible shape, with deep, painful cracks, and I only wore sandels with socks, because I was so embarrased.    Based on the reviews for this product I hesitantly bought it, although it seemed a little expensive.  I have NEVER had anything that removes dead skin from my feet as quickly and painlessly as this file!  I used to cut the dickens out of my feet using the blade smoother, making it painful to walk until the cuts healed.  The Egg type foot smoother also hurt my heels.  No matter how hard I buff my feet with this smoother, it hasn&#x27;t hurt my feet.    This product may look similar to other \\&quot;grater\\&quot; type files, but it&#x27;s far superior and has a lifetime warranty.  The only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t have an attached holder (like the Egg) to contain the skin filings, which end up as a very fine powder.  I go outside on the deck to keep the \\&quot;foot-dust\\&quot; from getting all over everything in my bathroom.  It&#x27;s sooooo worth it, because now my feet are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt!!  I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough.</li>
    <li> Now that summer is fast approaching I can&#x27;t think of a better product to get your feet in shape for sandals and sexy heels. I am a fan of the Diamancel Diamond Foot Buffer (much more expensive) but apparently diamonds are not forever. I read the top reviewer Scott&#x27;s review for this product and I was sold. Once this arrived I was not disappointed. In a matter of minutes my feet were sexy smooth. I think this foot smoother is better than anything I&#x27;ve used before. Yes it is a bit like a grater but all that comes off your feet is a fine dust of dead skin cells. Just use this foot smoother over a towel and clean up is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> Works very well to remove dead skin.  Has a coarse and medium side which is nice.  Quickly and easily removes dry callused skin from my feet, leaving them nice and soft.  Well constructed, I can see this being around for a long time.</li>
    <li> A few months ago my feet looked pretty bad, and one of the reasons is the skin gets dry, flaky, and for some reason the dead skin seems to accumulate in thick layers, particularly around the heel and the floor touching part of my forefoot - it&#x27;s hard for me to fully describe, but I&#x27;ll say I was too embarrassed to wear sandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a pumice stone in the shower like my mother suggested, but the pumice required too much muscle power on a regular basis.  I think it&#x27;s because even though the stone provided friction, it just was not abrasive enough for my manly feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried the Denco foot smoother, and I was amazed by how smooth it made my feet with minimal effort!  I now use the foot smoother on my heel and forefoot, and the stone to get at the contoured parts in-between since these areas are less problematic for me, and also the smoother doesn&#x27;t do those parts well because of its long flat surface.  I also use an abrasive rag to rub away any dead skin between my toes, since the stone can&#x27;t fit between them.  These are only suggestions for people who have similar foot problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  I use it once a week, and months later it&#x27;s still going strong.  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> This works pretty well, better than other things I have tried. My feet get very calloused living out in the woods and wearing sandals all summer. I use it right after getting out of the shower. It definitely improves the appearance of my feet!</li>
    <li> This scrubber is very useful and works well.  You can only really use the top side as the curved plastic around the blade keeps you from being able to really use the back.  I use a callous softener and then scrub with this thing and I end up with great results.  Holes do not clog and handle is sturdy.  I would definitely buy this as it&#x27;s been the best scrubber I&#x27;ve bought out of all the many gadgets I&#x27;ve tried over the years.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be great but its just okay. It seemed like the perfect tool to keep in the shower and scrub your feet but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like its doing anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times and me and my feet love this one! I wouldn&#x27;t count on life time guarantee (as per other review, it might be difficult contacting the company) but if it lasts close to 1 year I&#x27;d already be very happy. Let&#x27;s see how the file behaves with time...&lt;br /&gt;But it really feels good on the feet - at 1st look I thought it would be rough on the skin, but somehow it&#x27;s not, it just peels away the dead skin very nicely, no clogging on the file, easy to clean - really no complains so far!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this, but decided to give it a try after reading someone&#x27;s blog about using it.  AMAZING!!  I have horribly dry feet (think ripped socks dry).  Took a few swipes with this after getting out of the shower just to see how it worked and couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Was completely painless and I could not believe the amount of dead skin it took off.  My feet don&#x27;t look this good after a pedicure!  The longer handle makes it so easy to use-no uncomfortable positions trying to reach everything.  I&#x27;m throwing away every other foot tool in my closet-this one is a keeper.  WARNING: you will become addicted to seeing how much dead skin this thing can get rid of.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for two years to find something to help with my heels. No matter what I tried, they ended up cracked. After one use of this, they look a lot better!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this because it was made in China and, based on that country&#x27;s history with the production of milk that made people sick and other faulty products, I try to buy goods made in the USA.  However, I trusted the reviews for this item.  Well, either the reviewers lied, which I doubt, or I received a defective item.  This shaver does nothing .. it wouldn&#x27;t remove small ridges on my toes that my Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foot file easily removed with little effort.  The handle is helpful when using this, but I would not buy this again.  Worthless piece of junk.</li>
    <li> not any good. does not work on well maintained feet let alone feet that need a lot of work. just another gadget. would not recommend</li>
    <li> For some reason my husband just doesn&#x27;t like it very much. He said he definitely preferred using the ped egg.</li>
    <li> This works well and seems to be made out of very good quality. I would pick it up if you need one.</li>
    <li> This is so much easier to hold onto while smoothing the bottoms of my feet. The handle length helps a lot. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Reliable and very firm. The coarse and the medium sides are really useful. I would definitely recommend this product !</li>
    <li> I use this to scrape off dead skin on my heels. It does that job quite well. It seems to be well constructed, and will last a while.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was needed!  I thought that my heel was just showing signs of wear and tear!  With some very nice cream, this was a wonderful discovery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works beautifully!</li>
    <li> This does a good job removing your callius but due to the shape the metal file tends to dip a little.  So with the design of the file having the plastic edges around it, it makes it awkward to use in some angles, because the plastic prevents the file from touching your skin,</li>
    <li> I got this based on the fact that it was two sided but the frame that holds the abrasive surfaces is very thick. On the one side it seemed to work ok, but I could only use it for my heels and the side next to the big toe. I couldn&#x27;t position it to work on calluses on the side of my foot. The other side was a complete waste. I could only use it for my heel. Again I couldn&#x27;t find a position to be able to use it on any other part of my foot. Gave it 3 stars because it can be used to smooth calluses on my heel.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s one of the few that i can really get my heels smooth with. Perfect angle for scrubbing all areas of your feet. The pad also lasts a long time whereas others wear out too fast! Ive been using mine over a year now. Still going strong!</li>
    <li> I bought this file for my calloused feet, hoping it would help me keep the callouses from building up and cracking. It seems to work really well.  I got out of the shower, when my feet were soft and filed and filed.  This file seems well made, and definitely files off the skin.  It works so much better than the Ped Egg I had been using, and at least as well as the cement sidewalk outside, which I had used sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only worry is that that with enough pressure the metal filing part will pop out of the plastic housing.  At least this item has a lifetime guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA Dec 7, 2010:  The plastic handle on this file did indeed break after nearly a year of three times weekly use.  I searched the Internet for the maker, to ask for a replacement.  In the end I emailed the Amazon seller, who quickly and kindly sent me a replacement.  A+ to BEI - PHR Systems, Ltd. who took responsibility for the warranty, and B+ to the file itself. It still does a great job sanding off the calluses on my heels. I&#x27;d love to find the same file with metal housing, but as long as the warranty is honored I&#x27;ll be happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my boyfriend. He has very bad callus on his heels since he is a big guy. He said this is the best callus removal tool he has ever used so far. He carries it every time he travels</li>
    <li> As I got older my heels became dry and cracked during the summer. Nothing worked. Got this and use it in the shower or dry and my feet are so soft now and heels are all healed. I use it daily. It looks like it&#x27;ll be rough or painful but I don&#x27;t feel anything at all- it works really well. I Highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and really helps me keep my feet smooth. It is well made.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the coarse side is switched with the medium side. And the medium side which is coarse is kind of inside of the frame so it&#x27;s not really usable to most of my feet, but only to the heels. I don&#x27;t want to deal with exchange.</li>
    <li> The rim around the file makes the other side difficult or somewhat useless to use.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday in the shower on my heels and it works wonders I never have rough or cracked feet and it is not harsh either.</li>
    <li> I used to go to a salon where they would use this.  I was so excited when I found it to buy.  No more spending money to get every bit of rough skin off of my feet.</li>
    <li> I think the product is okay. It&#x27;s not great, I have another product that works better called a Checi, I thought the Denco would be better so I thought I would give it a try, and its just okay.</li>
    <li> About at month ago I purchased the Denco Easy Grip Foot Smoother and I am very satisfied with it.  It is so much more effective than any other device of this type I have used in the past. It is easy to use and easy to clean.  I also purchased the Be Natural Callus Eliminator and the Bario Electric Callus Remover at the same time, and the three work beautifully together.  The way I use them is to soak my feet in warm sudsy warm first and then I apply the Be Natural Callus Eliminator as directed.  This really softens the calluses so that the Denco Smoother can scrap off the bulk of the callus formation.  If you only used these two products together, they do a good job.  However, I really like my feet smooth, so I finish by using the Bario Electric Callus Remover which gives my feet the finishing touches I like.  I do not know how the Denco works without the Be Natural Callus Eliminator, since I have never used it alone.  It most likely dependents on the severity of the callus formation an individual has as to the number of products that are needed to get a professional job accomplished.  When I finish my pedicure, my feet feel as good as if I had received a professional pedicure.  When I was trying to decide which products to order to get the job done, I read quite a few of the Amazon reviews on many of the pedicure products and decided on these three based on what I learned from the experiences of others. I live in a cold dry winter environment in Colorado, and my heels get very callused and rough. A week after a professional pedicure I felt like I needed another one. That gets expensive, so I decided to buy these three items to take care of my callus problem myself.  I am very pleased with my decision.</li>
    <li> If I can give 10 star review, I totally could have!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I was excited about this...but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than any other callous remover that I&#x27;ve used before. Maybe I&#x27;m not using enough force...I&#x27;ll give it another try.</li>
    <li> Get dull really fast can&#x27;t reach someone to get new one</li>
    <li> If you have gone through (as I have) electrical devices and other types of sanders, you will love this one. It works rapidly on the hardest types of calluses. I bought three to give to relatives for Xmas.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product so far. It strikes the right balance between effectively removing dead skin while being gentle and painless, unlike some other metal files I have used. Because it&#x27;s so gentle and easy to use, I&#x27;ve been using it a lot more often than the pumice stone and harsh metal files that I previously owned. This file just glides over your feet, does not hurt at all, and yet the results have been great. As long as it maintains its effectiveness, I&#x27;ll maintain this 5-star review.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT,I LIKE IT VERY MUCH,I USE IT ALMOST DAILY,IS VERY GOOD QUALITY, THE LAST ONE  I HAD,I USED IT FOR MORE THAN 4 YEARS.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one. Of the similar solutions out there this one has worked the best for me. Time will tell how long it will last.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product jut thanks to great reviews here and I do not sorry. This thing works so good that my callus is gone after first use and metal part has so good structure and holes that let dead skin go out. It is easy to clean it. All those stones and stuff do not work and even makes cracks bleed. This thing cut so good callus around cracks so my skin healed in 2 days and no new crack on the same place. This is well deserved 5 stars.</li>
    <li> here we go again, reviewed this through email notification which does not take it out of my amazon account when i log in.  this product is pretty good but not the exact quality as those in the salon.  For the price and being able to acquire it when unable to order with a license for the real product, this does suffice!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my pedicures the. Nothing I have owned before has ever really taken care of the rough places, and this tool does it with efficiency and little effort. This is a must-have, whether you wear sandals or not...</li>
    <li> I bought this one after staring at 10 different ones in the store and have to say its the best decision! Like everyone else says it works wet or dry (I think better dry) and never clocks like other products. I kept picking at my dry feet got some deep cracks. Other scrubbers didn&#x27;t really get these rough edges off and the pedicure place with the \\&quot;power sander\\&quot; only worked a week or so. This thing gets those edges off so I leave my feet alone and they are ver smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only small complaint is frame is a bit too high on the medium side but assume this is to keep it from bending. The rough side is good, and I use this most of the time as it isn&#x27;t that rough and does&#x27;t scratch up my feet like other products. It is NOT a cheese grater, although it looks like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly the lifetime warranty is because this is a solid product not a cheap thing that will break or wear out - if it does get a new one (but I doubt I will have to)!  So stop looking and just get it.</li>
    <li> Sadly, it took forever for the Denco Easy Grip Professional Foot Smoother to arrive. But once it did, I went right to work on my feet. I&#x27;d read a review saying it worked best dry, so I used it on my dry feet. Within minutes, my feet were silky smooth. I followed with washing and lotioning. My feet feel wonderful. No more sand paper feet! I highly recommend the Denco Easy Grip Professional Foot Smoother.</li>
    <li> This callus remover has the right roughness to remove most calluses.  The only problem is the surface is somewhat recessed, so if your doing areas that stick out, the the heel of a foot, it is a little harder to use.  For calluses that are harder to get to, I recommend Tweezerman Power Dual Callus Rasp (5049-P) that you can get on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have bought different types of tools to remove callus and none of them ever worked. There never was a difference and it was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;However, I can finally say that I found a product that works! I tried the tool by itself and with the callus eliminator and it works! You can actually see what is being removed and wash it off with just water. It is more effective if you use it with the callus eliminator (I left it on for 1 minute) and then start scraping. I no longer have to pay an extra $5 when I go for my pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;I usually have a hard time believing that products work especially after spending money and realizing most don&#x27;t, but this is a product you must buy if you have callus. It will get the job done very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have dry cracking feet with big callouses on the heels that are painful and generally not too enjoyable. My father has them too. Unless there&#x27;s snow on the ground, I&#x27;m in bare feet or flip flops. I kind of thought that&#x27;s just the way it is until my wife set me straight (as usual) and I started doing some research. I purchased O&#x27;Keefes Healthy Feet as well as the Denco Professional Easy Grip Foot Smoother - both from Amazon. I started soaking my feet every night in warm soapy water for about 15 minutes, have at the callouses with the Foot Smoother (which is like a cross between sandpaper and a cheese grater), put the O&#x27;Keefes on, and put on some socks. I&#x27;ve been doing it for a week and my feet are 100% improved. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d see the same results if I didn&#x27;t do all three steps, but I suspect not.</li>
    <li> In the summer, I am pretty much always barefoot or in flip-flops. As such, a file is a daily necessity for me. I&#x27;ve always used files and have been perfectly happy with them (the sandpapery type) but when it came time for a new one, this one caught my eye because of all the great reviews. I was pretty excited to try it out but ended up not liking it as much as I do all the files I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely like how the dead skin goes through to the other side meaning you don&#x27;t have to keep rinsing it off while you&#x27;re using it and I also like how quickly it gets the job done compared to regular files (I sometimes would spend ten minutes filing at my heels but I&#x27;ve never had to use this one longer than a minute or so to get similar results) but those are honestly the only pluses over a regular file that I can see. This does not achieve even close to how smooth I can get my feet to be with a regular file. In fact, the skin on my heel sometimes seems pretty jagged and the \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; side does absolutely nothing for it. I&#x27;ve ultimately decided to get another file to supplement this and my daily foot maintenance is done in half the time it usually takes. I use this Denco file to do all the hard work and then to smooth it out afterwards, I just quickly use a regular file. Works perfectly for me I just wish there was a way it could be all in one product rather than two.</li>
    <li> I do about 7-8 pedicures a day with this file and I love it! It doesnt seem to dull and does a fantastic job!</li>
    <li> I purchased this smoother for callouses on different areas of both feet.  It seems to work well on convex spots, bunion area and heels, but the medium side is inset far enough that it does not work on the callouses on the ball of the foot. Why inset one side to limit the use of the product. I like the smoothing idea as it is easy to clean and seems to work well on the areas where I can use it. I would like to give it 2.5 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so big.  It really just stands out in the shower.  It&#x27;s about the size of a large hairbrush.  I thought it would be smaller, take up less space.</li>
    <li> I run about 30 miles a week.  As expected, I have pretty rough feet.  The tops of my toes were callused and rough, and recently, the calluses had begun to turn black for some reason.  It had gotten to the point where I was too embarrassed to wear flip flops anymore.  I&#x27;ve always worn band aids over the calluses when I run, in a failed effort to prevent them from getting any worse.  I also used moisturizer twice a day to try to soften up the skin.  I&#x27;ve always just accepted this since running so often means my feet will never heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I decided to try to do something about my feet so I ordered [[ASIN:B001F9ZERY Mr. Pumice Purple Extra Coarse 2pcs]], and hesitantly, the Easy Grip Foot Smoother.  The only thing worse than the seemingly outrageous price is the phrase \\&quot;foot smoother.\\&quot;  The idea of rubbing a mini cheese grater over the tops of my fleshy toes makes me grimace, but based on the reviews here, I went forward and purchased it anyway.  I started on the worst offenders, my two big toes.  I&#x27;m still not really sure which side is coarse and which is smooth, but it didn&#x27;t matter because they both worked.  Within 3 minutes, the calluses that I had had for a year were completely gone and my skin was as smooth as a newborn&#x27;s.  I simply used light pressure on the shaver and it sanded off the dead skin, leaving a fine white powder on the floor. I felt absolutely no pain at all and there was no discomfort.  Since the skin is already dead, I barely felt it.  I won&#x27;t go near one of those cuticle tools, but this device felt fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I started on one of my middle toes.  I have had a callus there for 6 years. It has always bothered me.  I have spent probably $40 in band aids covering it up every run, and have had to stop runs because it was so annoying.  In the last two weeks, it had turned black. I have tried cutting it out with a knife before and using clippers on it to remove it, but it never works well and always comes back. The foot smoother reduced about 95% of it, and only left a small dry area on the top of my toe that is barely noticeable.  I would have paid someone $50 to do what the Foot Smoother did in five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Foot Smoother works so well that I was really disappointed the calluses were gone and that I couldn&#x27;t continue using it.  I now look for calluses on my feet and get excited when I feel a rough spot that I can get rid of.  Now, I have no calluses on my feet at all, and just use the foot smoother once every couple weeks for maintenance.  I am sure a professional pedicure could probably accomplish the same thing, but being male, I can&#x27;t bring myself to get one.  For the price, it is definitely worth it to know I can still run and be free from calluses.  Also, even though the last picture on Amazon shows the Smoother and four other tools, you only get the Smoother and it does not come with any extra products.  My one complaint is that one of the sides (coarse side maybe) is recessed a little bit in the handle, and it makes it difficult to reach some areas of the foot.out 95% of it, and only left a small dry area on the top of my toe that is barely noticeable.

    <li> This product is a bit pricey... but i have horrible feet and after using numerous other products, this one was the best. It really does smooth the foot andit lasts more than a day. This is a good investment. I dont have to keep buying other stuff that can add up to costing a lot more.</li>
    <li> I, unfortunately, seem to have peasant feet--leathery soles with sandpaper heels that get deep cracks almost overnight. I keep a pumice stone in the shower and use it daily, but in the summer my feet seem to get even worse. And recently I bought a pair of Chaco sandals to wear while taking our dog on 2 mile walks and well, everywhere, really. I&#x27;m living in them. The Chacos (also purchased at Amazon for a great price) are VERY comfortable--but I did notice almost immediately that my heels seemed to be REALLY callusing/cracking--so much that I Googled the problem--and it&#x27;s a common problem among Chaco wearers but not a deal breaker. So--what to do about the calluses?  Found the Denco Professional Foot smoother on Amazon, read the reviews, thought--why not? Let&#x27;s see if it really IS different/better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word--YES. It IS different. I have an egg, the razor thing (that really CAN be dangerous,) another cheese grater like thing, a variety of Pumice stones from serious rock like to the softer Mr. Pumice--The Denco leaves them all behind. I used it on my dry feet before my shower--working over the trashcan to collect the dust--and then I used it again after my shower.  My heel cracks are so deep that it is going to take some time before they can be completely fixed--and you do need to be careful--my heel was a little tender around the most severe heel crack--but it was already there, so not the Denco product&#x27;s fault. I have some of the callus remover lotion on order and look forward to using it with the Denco Smoother to help my heels.  But for now--I LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need the baby smooth skin that most women want but there is always the problem of having that rough skin which remains after using a more aggressive callus remover which snags on everything soft or fuzzy like sloths and blankets. For that this is a great tool to smooth out the rough edges. I give it 4 stars because it is so smooth itself that it takes a while to use and I&#x27;m not a patient person on most days. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is crap.  A 2 dollar callous remover from CVS is better. I cannot beloved how flimsy and ineffective it is.</li>
    <li> I love this foot smoother because it is not abrasive and works great. It also last forever.</li>
    <li> My daughter has a sliver or planter wart that my doctor asked us to hone down so he could properly inspect it. I bought this, and as a food smoother I suppose it works fine, but on her small feet it was so wide it could only touch the high points of the foot. The active smoothing area is surrounded by a fairly wide boarder of plastic and metal so I imagine this could be a problem on some larger feet that have more contours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used countless foot scrubs, smoothers, pomice stones, etc.  Nothing really helped my dry, hard calloused skin.  I&#x27;ve used Revlon&#x27;s scrub and it does a great job, but you have to use it at least twice a week for maintenance.  I got sick of doing it so often so I gave up for a while.  After a year of not scrubbing my feet, I developed really bad callouses and my husband was grossed out! So I had to look for another foot scrub and I ran into this one.  I thought it would take weeks of scrubbing to smooth my skin, but it actually worked like a miracle the 1st time.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  For maintenance, I use it every 2 weeks and that seems to be good enough to keep my feet smoothe.</li>
    <li> This made quick work of some very large rough callouses, but only after I figured a couple of things out:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You must soften the callouses first. I used a solution I purchased here that worked very well, but it was a little scary (lots of cautions on the label). I finally just hung it in the shower and give my feet a quick going over last thing. This worked much better and also solved another problem:&lt;br /&gt;2) It clogs almost instantly. After 1 or 2 passes it stopped working. I quickly discovered it gets clogged and too smooth to work. A quick water rinse puts it back to like new (literally just a split second under a faucet is all it takes). Using it in the shower solved this, as I leave the shower running as I use it and just hold it in the shower stream for a second every couple of passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t forget to try both sides, they work a little differently from each other.</li>
    <li> From the description, I was expecting something that actually helped smooth the rough skin on my heels. It did nothing. I tried using it dry and in the shower. It did nothing!! It was a wasted purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this really tears away the skin like I expected.  Every time I use this, I think &amp;#34;well it looks like it did a little. . . . I think?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Surprising how it smooths the heel.</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews I feel I must have overlooked something.  I could not get enough metal on my food to scrape.  The heavy plastic around the metal prevented it from touching my foot.  I have very skinny feet, so I don&#x27;t know what I was doing wrong.  I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Read all of th Savage&#x27;s series and it was at the top of the reading chart. Never was entrusted with trust and family love.</li>
    <li> Picked this up last year to treat myself.  I also bought a callus eliminator and had quite a few &#x27;Spa Days&#x27; with my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, it has made its way into my shower.  Instead of the entire pedicure production, I use it at the end of the shower (probably less than a minute total) and follow up with my usual body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is extremely well made and shows no sign or rust or other break down even after it has lived in my shower for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feet are smooth and I am looking forward to sandal season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit**  Have had this for 3 years now and still going strong!</li>
    <li> I received this product in record time and it very easy to use. It work really great on my feet.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that suffers from chronic heel calluses.  I use it in the shower and it really does the trick.  Looking forward to wearing sandals this summer.</li>
    <li> Love it so much I bought one for myself, and gifted to others as well.</li>
    <li> Really poor results. Maybe if you have super thick but not hard calluses it will work. Mine are not thick enough to be affected by the shallow level of removal offered. Barely skims mine.</li>
    <li> I wear flip flops or am barefoot 99% of the time plus I&#x27;m prone to developing calloused gross heels/feet quicker than anyone. Ever. Seriously. Have tried everything from PedEgg to foot creams to foot buffer/polisher/scrubs/home remedies...you name it. Have looked for YEARS. I would even bribe the nail technician to bust out a powertool to literally SAND them down during my almost weekly pedicures. This is not an exaggeration. We are talking powertools that you stand in line with men in hard hats to buy at Home Depot kinda powertools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this 2 years ago and stopped having to worry about the embarrassment, the bribes, the excessive pedicure bills.  Home Depot? What&#x27;s Home Depot??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. Get this. Stick it in your shower and stop wasting anymore of your life. You can send me a Thank You card later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want normal heels today? Done. Even tough soles can be conquered in a matter of a few minutes. If that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easiest way for me: End of shower (usually right after I put conditioner in my hair), I take about 5 swipes each foot and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never had a cut or anything, and I am regularly careless and/or half asleep and haved use a TON of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And apparently there&#x27;s a lifetime guarantee...)</li>
    <li> I bought this tool thinking that it was similar to the one used on the nail salon. It is not. Shaver is not sharp enough to remove dead skin. It helps a little, kind of filing your skin.</li>
    <li> My heels for some reason started to crack on my one foot, I got this, was petrified to use it, then gave it a try....my heels are smooth again!!! I would suggest this to prevent cracking, as now I have some indentations from the cracking that will take awhile to smooth out, don&#x27;t wait like I did, take control of your feet!!! It doesn&#x27;t hurt physically, but if you are like me then you have to get over the mental part of &amp;#34;am I really going to take a metal &amp;#34;grater&amp;#34; to my skin?&amp;#34; Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it!!! I wish I got this when my heels first showed signs of dryness, after the dryness comes the cracks, so don&#x27;t let it get that far. I will be using this as part of my morning routine from now on!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very effective thanks to thought-out design of the surface. Try using when yr feet are wet, much less dusty.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about how well this foot smoother would work. All of the other products you can buy in retail shops just didn&#x27;t work for me.  This one is like the professional ones in the nail shops, and works really well!  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband. He was using my pediegg and the review said this was great. He wasn&#x27;t that impressed. One side of the file is flush for easy use, but the other side is kind of set down into the plastic making it more difficult to use. Kind of a strange design.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an egg and pumice stone for years and trying to get rid of a deep crack in my heel.  When this product arrived last night I immediately got in the shower and was AMAZED at how effective and comfortable it was!  It removed more of the callous/crack in one use than I&#x27;ve been able to remove so far with my recent and diligent lotion/gel socks/egg/pumice treatments.  I gave my husband a home-pedicure and used this on him as well; his feet are now the softest they&#x27;ve ever been!</li>
    <li> This is a great foot file &amp; saves a trip to get a pedi. I think this is the best ever out on the market! Buy it you will love it!</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair stylist gave me my first Denco foot smoother and I loved it so much until it broke between the handle and the paddle. I was really happy to find it quickly on Amazon.  I use it on my feet after I get out of the shower and it keeps my feet looking and feeling pretty and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Also, now I have a lifetime warranty on it!</li>
    <li> Just arrived in the mail yesterday. The product looks like what&lt;br /&gt;I expected. No surprises. The handle is very soft and allows for a&lt;br /&gt;good grip. Can&#x27;t wait to use it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is okey product. Nothing so impressive. I used it with the callus remover solution but it took a lot longer to remove callus than anticipated.</li>
    <li> Great for att home pedicures,works well,leaves feet smooth was very happy,ready the the next day, good for kit thanks again</li>
    <li> Did nothing to my feet. Not coarse, does not scrub at all. Waist of money. That is just foil with holes in it.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on the reviews but let me tell you that these suck big time. I am a dude and I bought these for my wife because she needed one. She said they sucked so I tried them out myself just in case she was wrong. Nope, they really do suck. I have rough feet because I am a dude and I was expecting my feet to be like a baby&#x27;s butt after using the smoother. They still felt like sandpaper. This is how I did it. I went and showered, waited a few minutes for my feet to soak up the water, then I started using this smoother. Nothing. Just crap. What a let down. I was planning on playing footsies with my wife without cutting her.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom (she&#x27;s 62) for her birthday and she uses it all the time. She said it is very easy to use and she use it every other day. My mom has athritis so it was important to buy something easy for her to use. This is a great buy - buy it :)</li>
    <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s so easy to use. It makes my heels feel soft and smooth. It use it all the time to prevent my heels from peeling and flaking.</li>
    <li> Works great ,don&#x27;t over use this your feet might crack.</li>
    <li> This is great product, it can really take down a rough callus worth the money.  I don&#x27;t think you will be sorry you bought it.</li>
    <li> Works just as described. I tried it in the shower and tried it on dry skin. It works better (for me anyway) on dry skin.</li>
    <li> Product barely shaved calluses at all  Foot didn&#x27;t fit between the 1/2&amp;#34; sides of the scrapper to even reach scraper part.</li>
    <li> It is hard to angle Foot Smoother on bottom of foot.  Other than that, the product was fine and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> i was expecting it to be a little bit more tough on the calluses.&lt;br /&gt;one thing for sure it really make your feet solf</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, at least for me at all! I tried this dry on my feet ,which were rough ,and it wouldn&#x27;t or didn&#x27;t take off even a millimeter of skin? It feels like it&#x27;s rough enough to do something, but the amount of force that you would have to use with this to remove even a tiny little suspect of rough skin is scary. I give up and am returning it, very disappointing especially after reading all the great reviews for this.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what they say it will do. This product works like no other I have tried. Ordering another one!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would have a sharper surface to buff/grate away the crack/rough skin on my heals. When you hear the work &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; you expect it to be a tool you&#x27;d find at a nail salon. This is not anything special.</li>
    <li> Need to be careful with this item.  It came to me in damaged packaging, no written info, and no warnings/caution.  This item really removes the layers, and before I knew it, had removed more than should have in one setting.  I should have sent back as soon as received--after approximately six (6) months, still afraid to use again.</li>
    <li> OMG!!!! This thing works like magic.  I have very thick skin from wearing heels and it scrubbed off easily and made my feet so soft after use just one time.  No more ugly feet.</li>
    <li> Even though I unfortunately never received the item (must&#x27;ve been stolen/lost on the way), as soon as I contacted the seller they were very quick and kind, and refunded me right away. I would definitely do business with them again. Wish I got the tool on time though because I am going on a beach holiday, and nice smooth heels are always a plus there.</li>
    <li> This product was a huge disappointment! It is not an effective tool to remove the dead skin and rough patches from the soles of your feet.you can do a better job using an emery board.</li>
    <li> Works for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the best: If you have a lot of dead skin on your feet, try the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp - Brown (Pack of 2) + Bonus Pedicure Nail File 100/100 Grit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B00FM83PGG</li>
    <li> My husband had crazy bad old-man feet way beyond his years. They were so bad they were disgusting, so I bought this on prior reviews to take care of those bad boys. I told him what the smoother was for when it came in and before I knew it, he had taken it into the shower and came out with vastly more attractive feet. It was amazing and I thought he must have scrubbed for 30 min but he said it took more on the order of 5. Wow.</li>
    <li> This is a good product at a good price.  It&#x27;s easy to file down the foot in this rough areas.  I just do it over the trash, then get in the shower, and like that I have soft feet!</li>
    <li> This is the first foot smoother that i feel comfortable with using. It leaves my skin softer and i dont have to brace myswlf the whole time for fear of cutting myself or going too deep.</li>
    <li> Tried using this over the weekend.  I soaked my feet, then semi-dried them off and for me, this did not take off anything.  Tried it dry and the same problem.  Sorry I spent the money.</li>
    <li> THIS IS PERFECT FOR ME.  IT HAS HOLES SO THE DRIED SKIN JUST FLAKES OFF AND DOWN THE DRAIN.  IT SMOOTHS HEEL AREA WITHOUT HURTING .  THE SIZE IS PERFECT .  I WON\\&quot;T HAVE TO REPLACE THIS ITEM. IT HAS A LIFETIME WARRANTY.</li>
    <li> I use this smoother on a regular basis, but I think the shaver should have a little more edge to it.  If you soak with hot water and use right away, it does an okay job.....I just expected better results.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my shower and my feet are always smooth now. They are not calloused or peeling anymore....I love that my feet always look like and feel like I just got a pedicure.</li>
    <li> I have used everything made for my cracked heels, from lotions to razors. My feet are rough again within a day or two. Not with this! I use it on my heels in the shower every morning and no cracked heels!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried files, which seemed to do nothing for my rough feet, and the pedegg, which was okay but too small to work with comfortably.  This product does the job, has a comfortable handle, and has a hole in the handle so you can hang it up in the shower.</li>
    <li> ok unless I&#x27;m using this wrong it doesnt work my feet are not smooth at all! might try with another product but i soaked my feet in  bath so...</li>
    <li> Granted this foot smoother has a nice handle but the quality of it sucks. Does not smooth well at all. Save your money and buy a 5.00 callus remover at walmart or cvs</li>
    <li> This did not work for me.  I have gotten pedicures at the nail salon, and saw them using this so I searched online looking for one and found the one.  Maybe it was the brand, but this brand did not work for me....Would not recommend it...the seller shipped fast and prompt..</li>
    <li> I just received mine today and tried it out on one DRY heel.  The results were amazing.  I&#x27;ve used pumice stones for years (in the shower on wet feet)-the sandpaper kind (the stones are terrible) and this product leaves them all in the dust. The heel dust. Plus I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;ll wear out.  It also doesn&#x27;t hurt in the least.  Very gentle, subtle but effective.</li>
    <li> These take a lot less &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; behind them to rid feet of debris!</li>
    <li> I bought this for use on the bottom of my feet, and the lifetime warranty was very tempting! The product itself works great and the handle is very comfortable to use especially when scrubbing really hard.</li>
    <li> If you have foot calluses that are prone to cracking, this tool is for you.  Scrub with it every morning in the shower and then lightly coat your feet with Amlactin and put on socks, and the cracks will heal pronto.  Another plus of this tool: unlike a pumic stone, it does not harbor athlete&#x27;s foot fungus or other nastiness, since it is stainless and not porous.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all, wet or dry feet.  Nothing came off my feet.  Sandpaper would work better</li>
    <li> This foot smoother is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried. For once in my life I&#x27;ve found a way to smooth my feet without scraping them to bits like the &amp;#34;Ped Egg&amp;#34; does. It works great in combination with this lotion &amp;#62; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00117LNIO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not a &amp;#34;cure all&amp;#34; but a good tool. Works fairly well. It is well built and appears it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the best foot smoother and after much research I kept finding this one to be the best.  I ordered one for me and one for my mom for Christmas, and now I know why it&#x27;s rated so great!  It doesn&#x27;t tear up my feet like others, and actually feels like it isn&#x27;t taking dead skin/calluses away but when you feel your feet you will notice an instant improvement!</li>
    <li> Makes your feet rough and skin hangs off. It is better to use a pumice stone thatyou buy at the beauty store.</li>
    <li> Others before me have said it all!  I just want to add:  Wow! Wow!  Wow! This is the most amazing of all for Foot Smoothers ~ Callus Shavers I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Don&#x27;t hesitate; buy it now.</li>
    <li> really gets the tough skin off of your feet.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for removing bad spots on your foot. I find myself just using it at the oddest time. I have tried many foot smoothers, but this one I give a two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> EASY TO USE  -  GOT RID OF MY CALLUSES&lt;br /&gt;IN FIRST USE  -  I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM -</li>
    <li> Its not a bad product, but its no better than any other foot file.  I guess I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> What a product! I used it immediately and what a difference my feet felt! Highly recommended. Easy to use and no pain at all! I&#x27;ve used similar products that have cut my foot and make them bleed. This felt great on my feet and i&#x27;d use it over and over again!</li>
    <li> Love the length of the scrubber end and the handle. I now have the smooth heels I&#x27;ve been trying to achieve. This beats my current electric callus remover. I don&#x27;t need it. Basically, the electric one is very short and I&#x27;m unable to reach down to do my heels. I will sell this. Why didn&#x27;t I look here 1st? Oh well, not too late. I truly like this. Don&#x27;t have to scrub hard either. The results of 4days use is amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but only if you soak your feet in water until your callouses are moist.  Also try using a callous remover product you can also purchase at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply or here online on Amazon.</li>
    <li> many pumice stones work well but are a breeding ground for bacteria. this is a nice alternative and works very well</li>
    <li> I find that it&#x27;s hard to find the right type of product when it comes to caring for your feet and hands, especially for dry skin issues. I decided to start doing my own pedi&#x27;s to save money and time which I feel is wasted at the salons, not to mention the potential for bacteria and infections from many of these salons. I put together my own foot and hand supplies to enable my taking care of myself at home. I purchased the foot smoother as part of my kit, and it proved useless. It doesn&#x27;t have flexibility and doesn&#x27;t bend. After it&#x27;s use, it appeared to be dull and I felt I had to throw it away. I have serious dry skin issues on my feet and I need a product that is capable of actually helping, but this product simply didn&#x27;t work out for me. I had more success at simply soaking my feet for several minutes and using a pomice stone. The product just didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
    <li> I am happy I found this product. Works better than any I have had before.</li>
    <li> Works VERY well, and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have calluses on the balls of my feet &amp; this tool could not get them. Need to check into warranty</li>
    <li> IT WORKS BUT NOT MY FAVORITE.  A LITTLE FLIMSY ON THE GRATING PART.  NEED SOMETHING WITH A LITTLE MORE GRIT</li>
    <li> Very good tool, I&#x27;ve had mine 2 years now and it works great like new, it takes dead skin and calluses off as much as you want.</li>
    <li> I love having smooth soft feet. The handle on my last foot scrubber broke, so I had been searching for a new one. I bought a few different ones but they didn&#x27;t quite do a good enough job. I also bought electronic ones but they do more of a buffing/smoothing technique than any kind of scrubbing. This one was a little bit on the pricey side compared to most. I read a lot of reviews for many products and I decided to try this one because of all the raving reviews. I was a little skeptical because it doesn&#x27;t look like it could do much. I have only tried it on dry skin, not wet, and it worked great. It says it works on calluses, though I use it just to have softer smoother feet, and it works wonderfully! It is easy to clean. You have to find the right angling, but it definitely was a great purchase. I would highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I had bought it for a bartender and she said that is awesome, very special,  so there you go already.</li>
    <li> I use this combined with Pretty Feet &amp; Hands Rough Skin Remover and it does a good job of removing rough skin from my feet.</li>
    <li> Works great, without all the residue.</li>
    <li> I love this! Sturdy construction, very rough file, but once your foot is wet it glides right over and removes tons of dead skin. My feet were ashy and dry, but I soaked them in a Listerine/vinegar solution and went at them with this file. They are super smooth and no dead skin, it removed so much!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh I love this thing!! Wish I had found it years ago! Must have and never be with out!!</li>
    <li> Pretty good, I personally like the stone much better.</li>
    <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based solely on the reviews and am pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived with a nice form-note from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it and it seems to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely minor:  Product picture is BLUE.  Mine arrived PINK.  There isn&#x27;t anything that says color assortment may vary on the description.  I&#x27;m a guy and I now have a pink product.  If it matters to you then be advised.</li>
    <li> I previously used a different product that would sometimes leave my toes \\&quot;sore.\\&quot;  This product removes my calluses without any pain.  Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I have done much research on foot scrubs and this one sucks!!!  I work in a high-end restaurant and am on my feet ALL the time and wanted something to scrub away the pain of a long day...this product is not it.  Not sharp enough and doesn&#x27;t scrub away what needs to be scrubbed away!!!  Stay away!!</li>
    <li> It works well, but I prefer an electrical device where i don&#x27;t have to put in any work to get the job done.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well.  It seems kind of large for removing small calluses.  The blade is thin, and can be bent easily if you push too hard, or are not careful.  I would say the the smaller callus removers are a better deal (Walgreens).</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes in keeping my callused feed smooth as I HATE shoes and wearing flip flops most of the time.  This product is worthless, doesn&#x27;t work and I am back at my nail salon having them tend to my callus&#x27;s as needed....</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical how well this would work, but it did. As far as a callous shaver and foot smoother, this really does get the job done nicely. It will take a bit of effort and build your arm strength, but it works.</li>
    <li> Edit of Review: Yes I was very happy about the product...BUT and it is a BIG BUT: after about 3 uses it is no longer sharp, cannot get sharpened and had to be thrown away. I still bought another one to see if it was a one-time problem...and the second one met the same fate as the 1st one, finished its very short life in the garbage. The star rating is a challenge there...I would say at least I would deduct 2 stars from my initial (over-enthousiastic) review of only 1 use. I like things to last me a bit more than 3 uses. If you can afford to keep buying 6 per year, I would say you got it made with this product. So, based on each single purchase, for the short longevity of the product, I would allot no more than 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, a million time better than the ped-egg, as it doesn&#x27;t dull as long as you keep it clean and washed regularly. I use it in combination with a callus remover product, after soaking feet in hot water+baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a pedicure in years and had thick painful calluses. After only one use, it was an amazing improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that after a few times of this treatment I will have feet like new.</li>
    <li> The rough side was fine for smoothing.  However, the smooth side was recessed into the metal which made it very hard to do finer smoothing.  I ordered a different brand and threw yours away.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that this file didn&#x27;t quite get rid of the rough callus skin on my feet. The file didn&#x27;t seem to find purchase at all and was ineffective for me. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I left a message with the person I bought them from. They are not the originals, she said they are not a knock off. They have changed the look. They do not work like the originals, and they do not have the patient # on back, and the handle is a darker blue. I was very disapointed. She also said mine are very old. I bought them last spring. I don&#x27;t consider them old.</li>
    <li> I bought this tool because it is similar to the one they use at the salon I go to. Great investment! This was the only thing at the salon that I couldn&#x27;t find in the stores, and I was tired of paying $50 to get my toenails painted.</li>
