      <li>This is a great product but there is no way to advance the lead.  </li>
      <li>This liquid pencil is great for lining on water.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>If you dont wear contacts and are looking for a good pencil eyeliner that syats in place and does not smudge, this is great, but if you wear contacts, I would suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Good for the price.</li>
      <li>This is a good eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>DO NOT WAIST YOUR GOOD</li>
      <li>Not to mention the gas and wear and tear on my car, and my time.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, they&#x27;re not THAT good.</li>
      <li>This stuff stays on, it goes on smooth, it basically looks perfect!</li>
      <li>GOOD LUCK.</li>
      <li>The packaging says that it is suitable for contact lens wearers, but it is NOT!</li>
      <li>This is my all-time favorite eyeliner, so being able to order it through Amazon at a cheaper price than the stores is wonderful.</li>
      <li>Even with freezing it&#x27;s not the perfect point that it was when I first purchased it, but it works well for my needs!</li>
      <li>The smudger is great for a more smokey look.</li>
      <li>It is a great liner and easy to apply compare to my liquid pencil.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a few-times-use-throw-away kind of item....</li>
      <li>and it was packaged nicely.</li>
      <li>and I really recommend it :3!!!</li>
      <li>For those of us who can&#x27;t afford the wonderful high end cosmetics that you need to exchange an arm for-</li>
      <li>love this-- easy to apply, looks great and makes a statement.  </li>
      <li>This stuff also does not smear or come off too easily, which is good if you want it to stay.</li>
      <li>but the pencil does not glide very easily.</li>
      <li>and so you don&#x27;t use too much, be super precise, and close the cap after you&#x27;re done using it!!!</li>
      <li>My eyes are incredibly sensitive and this liner works wonderfully for me!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the best long-lasting, anti-smudge eyeliner that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
      <li>,it&#x27;s very smooth to apply</li>
      <li>I bought this because its supposed to be okay if you wear contacts.</li>
      <li>I love the smudger that is included.</li>
      <li>I use some finishing powder on my eyelid, this eyeliner, then more finishing powder</li>
      <li>Much better than liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Within three hour, without ever touching my eyes, the eyeliner had smudged on both eyes.</li>
      <li>Since I always struggle with lining my top waterline (I get squeamish about my eyes, and can&#x27;t help but blink)</li>
      <li>so this, powder and blush is all i need most days.</li>
      <li>but it doubly removes even \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; makeup superbly.</li>
      <li>I kept thinking I just wasn&#x27;t able to figure out how to twist more lead out of the tip.  </li>
      <li>I love this product but when I went to sharpen it with a Loreal pencil sharpener, it did not sharpen evenly.</li>
      <li>you cannot advance it like most mechanical pencils. .</li>
      <li>I already owned this eyeliner and was in love with it.  </li>
      <li>maybe a twist eyeliner or something with more eyeliner??</li>
      <li>The way it is designed make it look like a twist type mechanism to reveal more product.</li>
      <li>Well, this is great quality and packaging and shipping... and doesn&#x27;t really smudge..</li>
      <li>I recommend if this sounds like what you&#x27;re looking for. :)</li>
      <li>This is my favorite liner, goes on smooth, no tugging or pulling.  </li>
      <li>but it washes off easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Easy to glide</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and smoothly.</li>
      <li>Super smooth pencil!</li>
      <li>Color payoff is excellent: super pigmented and extremely black&lt;</li>
      <li>I use it on my waterline, and the contrast makes my eyes look huge.</li>
      <li>would think making the case turn so it brings up fresh gel would be better.</li>
      <li>I picked this up after watching a You Tube makeup tutorial where the gal lined her top waterline by just gently pressing this from underneath the top lid into the lashline.  </li>
      <li>The liner is creamy, smooth, and richly pigmented.  </li>
      <li>Revlon Colorstay Liquid Liner in Blackest Black: very good good, somewhat drying and stings if you have sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>A user of this product for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;- MAC Fluidlines in Blacktrack: using a separate brush, doing a cat-eye or winged-eye is super easy.</li>
      <li>Prestige Waterproof Eyeliner: an excellent option for the lower eyes - it really lasts all day long</li>
      <li>It has a very smooth texture and i will most likely use it forever!:)</li>
      <li>Lancome Artliner: very smooth application and easy to apply if you have a steady hand.</li>
      <li>I switched to a new kind and have not had a problem since.</li>
      <li>Also, not the kind of makeup you can sleep in and still look sexy the next day</li>
      <li>it goes on quick and precise.</li>
      <li>I really liked how vibrant the color was and loved how long it lasted.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make for the clean line that a liquid liner would, however, the smokey eye is pretty easily achieved with the smudging end.</li>
      <li>It is really dark, glides on nice and smooth, and stays put longer than most pencil, gel, liquid eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>but I think this product would get so much more further if there was some way to put more eyeliner led in it..</li>
      <li>I LOVE this eyeliner pencil when it is brand new; however, it has to be sharpened so often that one pencil doesn&#x27;t last more than a week!  </li>
      <li>During my search for an easy application eyeliner that was smudge proof, I tried many different eyeliners.</li>
      <li>As soon as I put it on it was a true black, it went on smoothly and stays in place for a long time withoug smudging- perfect.</li>
      <li>I am just glad I didn&#x27;t throw it out before I spent a lot more time researching these reviews which led me to re-investigate.</li>
      <li>The pencil is soft, so you won&#x27;t be able to get a point again unless you do something fancy.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner.its so smooth and dark and applys easily for a thicker liquid look.</li>
      <li>Decent cheap product.</li>
      <li>Lasting 12HR Wear Eye Liner in 01 Matte-Black Black: the color payoff is excellent.</li>
      <li>So you can easily get thick lines with a quick swip, and thinner lines are doable too, but with a steadier, more precise hand.</li>
      <li>The pencil is extremely soft and oily, so it runs out very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It applies onto the eye (I use it for my inner rims) very smoothly.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner can be a little too good when it glides over your lid</li>
      <li>it is the only way I&#x27;ve been able to remedy the problem.  </li>
      <li>it does have more moisture than a regular pencil eyeliner</li>
      <li>and then it stays pretty well throughout the day.</li>
      <li>one of the first things learned about makeup was to freeze pencil eyeliner to make it easier to sharpen.</li>
      <li>Goes on just like liquid eyeliner and looks similar to liquid eyeliner but with the softness of a coal pencil and more forgiving too.</li>
      <li>It does not extend or push higher.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple different eyeliners and I must say that this is by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>This eyeliner goes on the blackest and it  definitely goes on  the most intense and it stays the whole night.</li>
      <li>you want an easy to apply, thickish liner, and not a thin precise line that is more difficult to apply and get right.  </li>
      <li>so you do not need a very steady hand like you would for liquid liners</li>
      <li>I usually only review products that I feel really strongly about it.</li>
      <li>Only liner I will buy for an all day intense look that goes on easily.  </li>
      <li>Because the liner is so soft, which is what makes it go on so smoothly and thickly, it is very hard to get a good point on it without breaking off.</li>
      <li>I really like this eyeliner and the eyeliner smudger included on one end.</li>
      <li>I received it so fast</li>
      <li>Another thing is that the formula is really creamy</li>
      <li>What looks like a plastic casing on the pencil, is indeed, wood, and it is able to be sharpened, albeit not very efficiently.</li>
      <li>Very pigmented, but can be runny.</li>
      <li>Just like the name of the eyeliner indicates, it gives anyone wearing it an intense look.</li>
      <li>This has worked very well for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is a waste of money. You literally need to sharp it every time you use it, otherwise the edges of the pencil would hurt your eyelid. I am not buying this again I would definitely not recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you read my other reviews, you might notice that they are mostly 5 star reviews. I usually only review products that I feel really strongly about it. With that being said, I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for a little bit over 2 years. I&#x27;ve used SO many different black eyeliners and while some of the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past were very good, they still do not compare to L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Extra Intense Carbon Black Eyeliner. My eye area is pretty moist and I had a bad history of starting the day in the AM with perfectly lined eyes, ending the day in the PM with raccoon eyes. While I would tell you everything I&#x27;ve used for your benefit, all the bad liners I&#x27;ve used in the past were not at all memorable, so I will quickly review a short list of eyeliners I actually used which I would recommend for specific reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;- Revlon Colorstay Liquid Liner in Blackest Black: very good good, somewhat drying and stings if you have sensitive eyes. Lasts all day long but the color itself fades somewhat. It&#x27;s also somewhat tear proof as long as you&#x27;re not at a funeral or crying an entire river. A user of this product for about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;- Prestige Waterproof Eyeliner: an excellent option for the lower eyes - it really lasts all day long but the pencil does not glide very easily. If you are looking to do a cat eye or winged eye, it will not work with this pencil. A user of this product for about 7 years (and I still use it once in a while on my lower lids).&lt;br /&gt;- Lancome Artliner: very smooth application and easy to apply if you have a steady hand. The finish looks absolutely perfect. However, like Revlon, it does slightly fade in the day. A user of this product for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;- MAC Fluidlines in Blacktrack: using a separate brush, doing a cat-eye or winged-eye is super easy. However, this black is not the blackest black. Sadly, MAC is not the best brand to rely on when you are looking for an intense black. Used for 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;- SephoraLong Lasting 12HR Wear Eye Liner in 01 Matte-Black Black: the color payoff is excellent. A true raven pitch black. Sadly, the matte look makes your eyes look really dry. In reality, I think the formula DOES dry out your eyes as I see fine lines on my lids. This I am NOT fond of. Used for about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of L&#x27;Oreal Extra Intense Eyeliner Carbon Black:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to glide so you do not need a very steady hand like you would for liquid liners&lt;br /&gt;- Color payoff is excellent: super pigmented and extremely black&lt;br /&gt;- Sponge tip makes a winged-eye achievable&lt;br /&gt;- Especially when sharpening the pencil prior to application, the eyeliner actually does look like a liquid finish (precise, smooth, and sharp edges)&lt;br /&gt;- Affordable (and the second cheapest out of the list of other eyeliners mentioned previously)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- You have to sharpen frequently&lt;br /&gt;- Has a slightly shorter life than other eyeliner pencils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying this pencil at Target since I discovered a couple years ago but now purchase it from Amazon. Even though Amazon sells it for only 20 cents cheaper, I let Amazon dividends collect since I have the Amazon.com Credit Card. It pays off!</li>
    <li> Mediocre eyeliner, smudges over time and has very little product. You cannot sharpen the pencil after you use what is shown on the packaging. Very disappointing. Goes on as a nice black, but has little to no product.</li>
    <li> For those of us who can&#x27;t afford the wonderful high end cosmetics that you need to exchange an arm for- in comes this! This eyeliner is high pigmented, glides on and doesn&#x27;t have the horrible running raccoon effect after a few hours of wear. My eyes are incredibly sensitive and this liner works wonderfully for me!</li>
    <li> Smooth &amp; long lasting. I usually only have to reapply it to my waterline once mid day. I love the smudger that is included. I wish the cap would fit on the other end when I am using it though so I dont have to put it down.</li>
    <li> Wish it lasted a little longer. Much better than liquid eyeliner. I&#x27;m a mom of 2, I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to spend on putting makeup, so this pencil is great it goes on quick and precise.</li>
    <li> I like those pencils, the color stays all day long.</li>
    <li> I agree with the reviewer who states that this product is only good for a few uses.  I kept thinking I just wasn&#x27;t able to figure out how to twist more lead out of the tip.  Not practical to buy, even though I like this liner otherwise.p</li>
    <li> I tried this out, hoping it would be less expensive, but comparable to the urban decay 24/7 glide on eye pencil. It&#x27;s a similar concept, but this one smudged a lot  as I was applying and throughout the day if I touched my eye at all. This is just not the same quality as the Urban Decay, but it&#x27;s only half the cost, so I&#x27;m not truly disappointed in the results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the complaints I&#x27;ve seen are about sharpening this product. I&#x27;m not sure why everyone is having so much trouble, one of the first things learned about makeup was to freeze pencil eyeliner to make it easier to sharpen. This has worked very well for me. If in the morning when I&#x27;m applying make up I notice that my pencil needs sharpened, then I toss it in the freezer and leave it. I sharpen it when I get home from work or the next morning as I&#x27;m applying make up. Even with freezing it&#x27;s not the perfect point that it was when I first purchased it, but it works well for my needs!</li>
    <li> This liquid pencil is great for lining on water.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it bleeds down a little on the lower lid</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite eyeliner, so being able to order it through Amazon at a cheaper price than the stores is wonderful. Just like the name of the eyeliner indicates, it gives anyone wearing it an intense look. It applies onto the eye (I use it for my inner rims) very smoothly. It does smudge after wearing it for more than a couple hours, so I usually touch it up with a tissue or reapply it. I use this eyeliner everyday, sometimes I apply it more than once, so I can tell you that the pencil lasts usually 4-5 months.</li>
    <li> Will purchase again! Intense black, the only down fall was having to check my eyes and periodically wipe the corners due to smearing, but I have this issue with anything when I line the lower inside lash. Super smooth pencil!</li>
    <li> This is a great product but there is no way to advance the lead.  I eventually figured out a way to do it.  Though it&#x27;s a bother it is the only way I&#x27;ve been able to remedy the problem.  I take wire cutters and using a swivel motion and a little pressure until I cut through the bottom of the pencil, about one inch.  Then I take the blunt end of a bamboo skewer and inserting it into the cut end of the pencil I push the lead up.  Hope this makes sense.  Then if you want to sharpen the lead you can do that on a piece of paper.</li>
    <li> I use some finishing powder on my eyelid, this eyeliner, then more finishing powder and then it stays pretty well throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I used to wear only Chanel and now I will never pay that ridiculous price again.  This stuff stays on, it goes on smooth, it basically looks perfect!</li>
    <li> I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS A FIVE STAR BUT....DISAPPOINTED TO KNOW THAT WHEN I USED IT THE NIGHT BEFORE I GAVE A CONCERT JUST TO SEE HOW IT WORKS IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE A TWIST TO GET THE POINT BACK AND SHARPENING WON&#x27;T WORK BECAUSE IT IS PLASTIC. WHAT A JOKE, WAIST OF MY MONEY AND I WILL NEVER PURCHASE LOREAL AGAIN. WHICH WAS MY FAV. BUT THEY WON&#x27;T MAKE AMENDS. DO NOT WAIST YOUR GOOD EARNED CASH JUST TO TRY IT OUT, IF YOU DO, WELL SHAME ON YOU. GOOD LUCK.</li>
    <li> Literally got to use this once. It does not sharpen at all and instead just eats the entire pencil. Ive never had this problem with any other eyeliner so its not my sharpener.</li>
    <li> This is NOT smudge Proof.  In a few hours I had  huge smudges under my eyes!</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner and the eyeliner smudger included on one end. It is a great liner and easy to apply compare to my liquid pencil.  I haven&#x27;t tried gel yet. This does tend to smudge/smear a little but it washes off easily. Overall i like it and i will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented, but can be runny.</li>
    <li> I picked this up after watching a You Tube makeup tutorial where the gal lined her top waterline by just gently pressing this from underneath the top lid into the lashline.  Since I always struggle with lining my top waterline (I get squeamish about my eyes, and can&#x27;t help but blink), I bought this to try her method, and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pencil is so smooth and creamy that it makes lining your eyes (both the waterline area and the regular areas) a breeze. It reminds me of Urban Decay&#x27;s 24/7 liners, but is even a bit creamier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smudger is also nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a DARK black, but it&#x27;s great, doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge too easily, and has been lasting all day.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeliner,it&#x27;s very smooth to apply that&#x27;s why i like but one thing i disappointed  that it&#x27;s spread near the eyeline while they said it&#x27;s all day wear.</li>
    <li> During my search for an easy application eyeliner that was smudge proof, I tried many different eyeliners. I bought this for a few bucks and tried it on. Within three hour, without ever touching my eyes, the eyeliner had smudged on both eyes. \\&quot;Smokey,\\&quot; was definitely the right word if \\&quot;smokey\\&quot; means looking like you got knuckle punched in the face. If you are looking for an incredibly dark eyeliner that smudges and makes your eyes look gothic, go for it.  If you&#x27;re looking for an eyeliner that looks exactly like it did when you applied it a few hours ago, I recommend using&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline New York Eye Studio Lasting Drama Gel Eyeliner instead. It&#x27;s about the same price on Amazon and it&#x27;s the best long-lasting, anti-smudge eyeliner that I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Well, this is great quality and packaging and shipping... and doesn&#x27;t really smudge.. but I think this product would get so much more further if there was some way to put more eyeliner led in it.. maybe a twist eyeliner or something with more eyeliner??... when I bought this I guess I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the picture, this doesn&#x27;t really last long at all, and there&#x27;s nothing really there, so it&#x27;s a few-times-use-throw-away kind of item.... please, enhance your brains and make it last longer....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple different eyeliners and I must say that this is by far my favorite! It is really dark, glides on nice and smooth, and stays put longer than most pencil, gel, liquid eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried. There are some downsides though. This eyeliner can be a little too good when it glides over your lid so if you make a mistake it is tiny bit hard to remove, no big deal though. Another thing is that the formula is really creamy so I find my self using a bit more than expected and that leads to transfer both above and below my eyelids. Another one is that being that it is a LIQUID pencil it does have more moisture than a regular pencil eyeliner so you cannot forget to put the cap back on the eyeliner or else it gets dry and doesn&#x27;t glide on as easily and just doesn&#x27;t work as well :/. So overall you just need to get the hang of using this eyeliner and so you don&#x27;t use too much, be super precise, and close the cap after you&#x27;re done using it!!! Other than those things, this eyeliner is definitely my favorite and I really recommend it :3!!!</li>
    <li> love this-- easy to apply, looks great and makes a statement.  i&#x27;m a minimalist in makeup so this, powder and blush is all i need most days.</li>
    <li> It tends to smudge under the eye as the day progresses. I still like the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product but when I went to sharpen it with a Loreal pencil sharpener, it did not sharpen evenly. The wood part broke unevenly and the gel part broke off. I really like the ease of apply this pencil but Loreal needs to improve the way you sharpen the point.&lt;br /&gt;I would think making the case turn so it brings up fresh gel would be better.</li>
    <li> I wear contacts every day so its always tough trying to find an eyeliner that wont irritate my eyes. I bought this because its supposed to be okay if you wear contacts. ITS NOT. As soon as I put it on it was a true black, it went on smoothly and stays in place for a long time withoug smudging- perfect. However within five minutes of wearing it, my eyes became slightly blury in certain parts, I blinked a few times and was fine but then a few minutes later it became totally bluury and couldnt see anything, evin if I was blinking like crazy. If you dont wear contacts and are looking for a good pencil eyeliner that syats in place and does not smudge, this is great, but if you wear contacts, I would suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Good for the price. I generally like to L&#x27;Oreal brand of eyeliner, but am not as pleased with this particular line as I have been in the past. Is great for the dark, thick kohl look, but does not stay put very well, a big problem if you wear contacts. I have never had an issue in the past with lining my lower inner lid, but I&#x27;ve noticed this liner tends to always get onto the surface of my contacts which is obviously annoying. Also, not the kind of makeup you can sleep in and still look sexy the next day (do people actually do this...wait, what??!) unless you&#x27;re into the giant panda look, so also something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically: good for a dramatic look. Not good if you wear contacts, or like to look like you just put on your makeup for the day when you roll out of bed. Decent cheap product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very intense black, which is what I like, but it&#x27;s kinda soft so you can&#x27;t sharpen it to point which means it goes on in a pretty thick line.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make for the clean line that a liquid liner would, however, the smokey eye is pretty easily achieved with the smudging end.</li>
    <li> Omg this eyeliner .. I AM CRAZY about this eyeliner It stays on all day doesn&#x27;t smear all under your eyes .. the only negative thing is that it is a little hard to get off..  other than that I love !</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is waterproof, so it lasts all day. I use it on my waterline, and the contrast makes my eyes look huge. I&#x27;ve also tried it for my cat eye (although not to wing it out). It has a very smooth texture and i will most likely use it forever!:) I recommend this product to anyone who loves an intense eyeliner look.</li>
    <li> The Most Expensive eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Why?  You get about 1/4 inch of eyeliner, perhaps less. .  when that is used to a nub. . you cannot advance it like most mechanical pencils. . I twisted and twisted every moving part (there&#x27;s only one moving part, as far as I can tell. . the smudger part).  Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a black and a brown.  Same thing on both.&lt;br /&gt;So, since both lasted less than a week, at about $6 each? .  Normally a liner should last maybe 15 weeks?  soooo that means it cost me $90 if I keep buying them. Not to mention the gas and wear and tear on my car, and my time.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, they&#x27;re not THAT good.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite liner, goes on smooth, no tugging or pulling.  Long lasting!</li>
    <li> I have tried urban decay, mac, estee lauder, and so many other eyeliners but none of them compare to this one. The kohl is really soft so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wish it would but its still amazing. This eyeliner goes on the blackest and it  definitely goes on  the most intense and it stays the whole night.</li>
    <li> I already owned this eyeliner and was in love with it.  I bought this one because it&#x27;s a new darker black.  This color isn&#x27;t much darker than the other black liner offered in this line but I still like it.  The liner is creamy, smooth, and richly pigmented.  I don&#x27;t use liner in my waterline so I cannot speak to that but on my upper lid it holds up all day.  I have this in all three colors and I am a big fan. I will repurchase when I run out.</li>
    <li> Only liner I will buy for an all day intense look that goes on easily.  I only have to &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; my corners once or twice a day (same with ANY liner).  My eyes are also VERY sensitive and this liner doesn&#x27;t bother them in the least (even when I use on the lower eyelid ridge).</li>
    <li> Its longlasting, very intense black, very soft pencil, eyeliner look like as the result, easy to apply. Like it .</li>
    <li> You see that little nub extending slightly past the plastic casing?  That is all you get. Yup. It does not extend or push higher.  By the time you get to the bottom, it is as flat as a pancake and unusable.  This is a good eyeliner.  It goes on easily and smoothly. It&#x27;s a pity they don&#x27;t give you more product.  I have seen some mention of sharpening as if it is a pencil.  I don&#x27;t see how one could possibly sharpen it as it is packaged.    ***revised; and rating upped from 2 to 3 1/2 stars.***  What looks like a plastic casing on the pencil, is indeed, wood, and it is able to be sharpened, albeit not very efficiently. The way it is designed make it look like a twist type mechanism to reveal more product. Because the liner is so soft, which is what makes it go on so smoothly and thickly, it is very hard to get a good point on it without breaking off. However, It really is great for those days you want an easy to apply, thickish liner, and not a thin precise line that is more difficult to apply and get right.  It stays on well throughout the day. Remember it is Kohl, not a liquid  liner.  I am still taking off for the terrible design.  I am just glad I didn&#x27;t throw it out before I spent a lot more time researching these reviews which led me to re-investigate.</li>
    <li> Goes on just like liquid eyeliner and looks similar to liquid eyeliner but with the softness of a coal pencil and more forgiving too. I bought the grey as well, and it very dark. The smudger is great for a more smokey look. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been hunting around for some BLACK BLACK eyeliner, and the reviews for this convinced me to buy it. I agree with what has already been stated: It is, in fact, BLACK BLACK. The pencil is soft, so you won&#x27;t be able to get a point again unless you do something fancy. So you can easily get thick lines with a quick swip, and thinner lines are doable too, but with a steadier, more precise hand. This stuff also does not smear or come off too easily, which is good if you want it to stay. It also doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes waxy, which some other brands do. It consistently lasts 12+ hours and fades only slightly after that. I recommend if this sounds like what you&#x27;re looking for. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I use [[ASIN:B0028RC5N8 Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion, Eyeshadow Base .34 fl oz (10 ml)]] before I put anything on my eyelids, so I can&#x27;t tell you what happens without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I remove it with [[ASIN:B004W24LQ6 Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Facial Cleanser with Cotton Extract, 6 Ounce]], which is just a regular facial cleanser but it doubly removes even \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; makeup superbly.</li>
    <li> I like this eyeliner alot ! It goes on smooth and wears for a long time without having to reapply. I received it so fast and it was packaged nicely. The price was a bargain would recommend this seller and I will buying from them again.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;Stays all day</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyeliner pencil when it is brand new; however, it has to be sharpened so often that one pencil doesn&#x27;t last more than a week!  In order to get it sharp enough to use, the entire pencil is used up much too quickly; therefore, it is too expensive to keep using.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.its so smooth and dark and applys easily for a thicker liquid look. I see a lot of complaints about contact wearing people. I don&#x27;t know what is going on with them but I wear contacts and use this eyeliner a lot and I never have an issue.they must get it in their eye somehow Maybe should use a translucent powder. Only reason I give 4 stars is because I&#x27;ve noticed it is hard to sharpen and is used up fast cuz its so soft. Also you can get it a hell of a lot cheaper at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I really liked how vibrant the color was and loved how long it lasted. However, it created a film on my contacts that made it impossible to see and irritated my eyes all day. I would rinse my contacts off constantly. At first I thought that my contacts were just old and ready to be replaced, so I bought new ones and had the same problem. Then I realized that it was my eyeliner. I switched to a new kind and have not had a problem since. The packaging says that it is suitable for contact lens wearers, but it is NOT!</li>
    <li> Have used this for sometime.  Great color intensity</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very dark and it spreads on easily.  The pencil is extremely soft and oily, so it runs out very quickly.  Because of this, I use it just for the waterline, and use a liquid marker for the rest.  It stays moderately well.</li>
