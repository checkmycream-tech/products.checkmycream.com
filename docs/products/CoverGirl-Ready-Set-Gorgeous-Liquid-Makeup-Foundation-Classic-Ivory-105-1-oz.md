<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Try the last COVERGIRL foundation that covers the spots on your skin and leaves you looking flawless and GORGEOUS! I got this  product free to test and review from Influenster and it has worked amazingly!</li>
    <li> This foundation ROCKS! It goes on so smoothly and stays matte all day long! Perfect for people like me who have sensitive skin and want good coverage without the caked on look of other foundations. Matched my skin color perfectly and didn&#x27;t dry me out or cause any flakiness. Definitely my everyday use foundation!</li>
    <li> Cover girl ready set gorgeous liquid makeup is definately a five star foundation. It has even coverage and applies fairly easy definately worth the price. It is a little streaky if not blended well enough but other than I def think its worth the price. I love the bottle it comes in and I also think the size of it is perfect, def seems like it will last a couple of months. i received form influenster to review complementary.</li>
    <li> I received cover girl foundation from influenster so I could test it and I was blown away! I won&#x27;t use any other brand after using this one!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this foundation! it is oil-free, creamy, and still hydrating. It leaves me skin feelings refreshed and not dry.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation. It works extremely well and blends in perfectly. It&#x27;s inexpensive and a great buy!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I love how easily it goes on and makes my skin beautiful. So smooth and makes my skin soft! I can&#x27;t get enough!</li>
    <li> I only buy covergirl makeup! I am such a huge fan of the new Ready, Set Gorgeous Liquid makeup foundation. It doesn&#x27;t run and covers beautifully. Covergirl is one of the few brands that makes makeup light enough for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> This product blends very well and covers up my black heads and pimples excellently. It is a bit heavy, but it overall provided great coverage.</li>
    <li> Upon receiving this product from influencer as a trial, I was excited. But the first time from application my skin dried out so fast and became raw.</li>
    <li> I received this foundation in the shade 115 from influenster for testing purposes and it is amazing. I was a bit if-y about it actually working but I like it so much more than my amazonian clay foundation by Tarte. Great coverage, longevity, and perfect matte finish!</li>
    <li> I received this foundation from influenster for testing purposes and I must say I love this foundation, leaves my face look flawless and natural!</li>
    <li> This is a decent foundation, but it&#x27;s taken some trial and error to get the best results. I have oily, acne prone skin. This foundation did not break me out, but if not set with a good powder and spray, I was an oily hot mess after a few hours. It starts out with a beautiful, matte finish but does not hold off oil without a good powder. (I used Rimmel Stay Matte for reference). I have dark marks, but my face does not have much redness. This covers most of my scarring. I do still need concealer for blemishes and under the eyes. The foundation doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy, even though it has medium-full coverage. For best coverage, stipple the foundation on with a dense brush. I wish there were more color selection. I bought 105 classic ivory and I still feel it&#x27;s a bit too warm for my fair skin. It is a great foundation when used correctly. I am not sure as to whether or not I will repurchase because I have found products that match me better at comparable prices. I am definitely going to finish the product because it has been working well with powder, I just feel there are better color selections. That is my biggest issue. If you have a great powder and can find your match this is a great product at an awesome price.</li>
    <li> Great foundation. I have very oily skin, and this is one of my new holy grail foundations. It covers well and doesn&#x27;t look cakey. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Color was perfect. Didn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; on. Only complaint, I wish the bottle was a different shape so I can get all of the product.</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of several beauty bloggers, I got this foundation.  I&#x27;ve been generally very pleased with it, although I feel like the coverage is a little lighter than I would have liked.  It does not irritate my skin at all, despite my sensitive skin.  As far as drug store brand foundations go, this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Best foundation I have used. Not too heavy not too light.</li>
    <li> Received this product courtesy of Influenster for review and I will say it is a pretty good foundation. I mean it was free and I like it and plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> okay I&#x27;m very picky with foundation i like the feel of not feeling anything on my face so this did it for me i got it free and to review so i tried it for a week in hot California and it covered really well and feels nice really good coverage without being too thick and sticky and cakey. to me it felt like the mac oil free on a slight thicker but it wasn&#x27;t anymore thicker for an oil free foundation I&#x27;m also on the oily side which is why for 4 years i stay on bb creams cuz i enjoyed the feel of being covered but not too concealed only sad part when i received it it was a shade to light so i looked a little off lol but good thing bronzer is our friends</li>
    <li> This makes me look so flawless. Super lightweight and easy to apply. I just use my fingers and BOOM done.</li>
    <li> i am a die-hard foundation geek, trying pretty much every drugstore one known to man. I had tried the Covergirl Clean foundation in the past and HATED it. So, i was a little skeptical to try this one too. I chose one of the color 105, and one of the color 110. The 110 was too dark and the 105 was perfect. I am a N2 in Loreal&#x27;s true match foundation which is lighter than this one, but strangely i found that this came out lighter than it looked in the bottle. It covers great, so when i have a breakout i always come to this one. As with all foundations, it can get cakey if its not applied properly or if you apply to much. But knowing how to apply it, i can honestly say it works just as good if not better than high-end foundations.</li>
    <li> This foundation is quite lovely but I do wish CoverGirl made a 100 shade that was lighter.  This is a tiny bit too dark for me.  I also don&#x27;t think it is the BEST foundation if you have dry skin, either, as while it may apply nicely, I do feel it sucks a little natural moisture from my face as the day goes on and it can cling to dry patches.  As long as I moisturize and use a hydrating primer, I&#x27;m okay, though!  It has a beautiful finish!</li>
    <li> I received this free from Influenster for testing purposes. At first, I wasn&#x27;t even going to test out this product. I have very fair skin, and most drugstore foundations do not match my skintone. They end up oxidizing and making me look very orange! I decided to give it a shot - that&#x27;s the whole point is testing it out! I was pleasantly surprised! I applied it with a beauty blender sponge - it applies very nicely and goes on smoothly. The coverage is VERY nice!! The staying powering was great too - lasted all day. The color didn&#x27;t oxidize much either!</li>
    <li> Great foundation!! Light to medium coverage (definitely buildable), blends seamlessly and has a great range of colors. Says it will prevent oils, but I noticed I had to powder on top for a totally matte look - has a natural finish that I think will look great on combo skin. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary through Influenster. I am officially a fan for life and will cntinue to buy this product for many years to come. Before receiving this product to try, I was spending $50 on the same size bottle for a different brand from Sephora. I can honestly say that COVERGIRL Gorgeous foundation works better. I highly recommend giving it a try and I am positive that you too, will become a fan for life!</li>
    <li> I received this product from Influenster for testing purpose in no. 305 and I absolutely loved it. I wear it daily for work and school and it stays on perfectly. I like the way it feel son my skin very light and it leaves my skin looking flawless. The only thing is that I have to blend it for a while to match my skin color it seems a little darker than I thought. Other than that, I recommend anyone to use it. I love it!</li>
    <li> It was a good make up. At first i didn&#x27;t think i was going to like it till i tried it on &amp; it works magic!!!  I recommend it..</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife and she loves it</li>
    <li> Good coverage for acne and redness but not good for oily skin even with primer and powder on. Have to touch up within a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> One of the best foundations i have ever used! Leaves my skin feeling and looking so great i absolutely love it! I received mine in influenster completely free for  reviewing purposes.  I emidiately went a purchased 2 😃 i love it!</li>
    <li> This foundation is so awesome! I mean it’s not tacky or sticky, it is so smooth and provides great coverage for someone like me! I break out a little here and there but I do not have severe acne, so this helps to cover up just what I need without feeling like a cake face! I always top this off with some mineral powder to keep it locked in. The color I was sent by influenster was 215, and it was a perfect match thank goodness! The packaging is super cute too!</li>
    <li> I received Covergirl Ready Set Gorgeous Foundation from Influenster for testing purposes. However, these opinions are all my own.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this foundation because it&#x27;s easy to find a true match! A little really goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t look cakey or flakey when applied. I also like how it works well as a concealer under my eyes and on the top of my eyelids. Most foundations don&#x27;t blend well in those areas, but it works just fine! I&#x27;m interested in checking out the other ready, set gorgeous products as I really do like this one! I was skeptical at the size of the tube, but like I said.. a little really does go a long way. it spreads so smoothly that you don&#x27;t need much. With that being said, it&#x27;s definitely worth buying!</li>
    <li> I received Ready, Set Gorgeous Liquid Foundation in the Deans List Voxbox through Influenster to trial. I really liked the foundation. It wasn&#x27;t sticky at all and it was very easy to apply and blend. The foundation was of medium coverage but was build able. The color was a fairly close match to my actual skin tone.</li>
    <li> I had to buy this foundation after watching one of my favorite YT vloggers raving about it - I am not disappointed!  This gives great buildable coverage and matches my skin tone almost perfectly!  I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on my skin since I&#x27;ve started wearing it - bought another as a back up!  Hope CG doesn&#x27;t discontinue this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this foundation. It is now a staple to my makeup routine. I love how it covers all my flaws, and gives me a smooth look. I would defiantly recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> What more is there to say other than that I absolutely love this foundation? Thanks influenster!</li>
    <li> I love this influenster for sending me foundation. It&#x27;s so smooth on the face and doesn&#x27;t make me oily.</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of liquid foundation until I used this product! Doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you are wearing a mask, very light weight and goes on smooth. It lasts long and I love to pair it with Covergirl powder on top.</li>
    <li> Best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s perfect with a beauty blender. It isn&#x27;t too heavy and not too light. I use this shade and I am quite pale.&lt;br /&gt;A little really goes a long way when using this with a beauty blender. I highly suggest this foundation. I was previously using the covergirl stay fabulous foundation, and as much as I liked it, it made me cakey and made me break out. I think this gives almost the same coverage but hasn&#x27;t broken me out. BUY IT NOW! :)</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve always used COVERGIRL foundations, and this one definitely lives up to the brand. Unlike other liquid foundations, it&#x27;s not too thick and it doesn&#x27;t get cakey by the end of the day. It also comes in a variety of shades, so it&#x27;s easy to find one that matches just right.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings toward this product- the color was awesome, which is refreshing, but it was waaaay too oily. The color match was new, especially for Covergirl, because I&#x27;m really, really pale and have a hard time finding foundation that is light enough for me. But this actually was there, and it was even a sample that I did not match myself - surprising! However, the product was way too oily for my combination skin. This con was major, as I could not get the product to last longer than 2 hours, even with primer, before looking oily! It did not break me out, so I would still consider this product decent, though!</li>
    <li> great cover girl liquid foundation, it doesn&#x27;t make your face look dry or cakey, its very easy to apply. Stays on your face all day.</li>
    <li> Love how easily this blends! Light coverage for a quick and easy finished look! It is definitely a cleaner feeling foundation for my skin. I received this as a complimentary product from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I started using this foundation for about a month now and I love it! It makes my skin feel and look like porcelain the minute I put it on. It instantly hides the redness of my face and covers my imperfections. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best for normal to oily skin. I have dry skin and it clung to my dry patches. Long lasting. Medium to full coverage. Satin/matte finish.I got this product as a tester to review.</li>
    <li> I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely a fan of this product (in fact, I already have purchased it way before I got it free to test out). It blends well and easily with your skin, providing you know what range of shade you are. It in no way looks fake or as if you have caked on the makeup - it looks quite natural. It isn&#x27;t oily, and I haven&#x27;t experienced breakouts from this product provided that I continue with my nightly face wash routine. I always moisturize, put on primer, and then put on Ready, Set Gorgeous for optimal results.</li>
    <li> loved it when i tried it on loved how gorgeous it went on with my skin</li>
    <li> I do not wear liquid foundation often due to sensitive skin. When I received COVERGIRL Ready, Set Gorgeous from influenster, I fell in love. It is light weight and not hard on my sensitive skin!  Definitely light enough for everyday use!</li>
    <li> Awesome product, great with my oily skin and lasted in the Kentucky heat, thanks influenster for letting me try a sample free before buying!</li>
    <li> I received this  foundation in my Dean&#x27;s List VoxBox from Influenster, I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to compare to the clinique foundation I&#x27;m currently using, but I was pleasantly surprised. This foundation went on smooth, had great coverage, and lasted all day. I&#x27;m also very fair, so it actually coming in a color light enough for me was another plus!</li>
    <li> I got the lightest color but it is too dark/orange and clearly is a different color than my neck. I have fair skin but I&#x27;m not pale and usually the lightest foundation shades (not counting collections that have a huge color range) work for me but this one doesn&#x27;t. I have oily skin and it holds up as well as most other foundations, which all let oil through in 4-5 hours. It applies nicely and would be a great foundation if not for the color.</li>
    <li> I bought this foundation a little while ago after I received a voxbox with this as an option and I got the second option.  As I was looking through everyone else&#x27;s pictures, I noticed that this product was getting amazing reviews so I had to go out and buy it for myself.  I love this foundation, it blends beautifully and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize on my skin.  It was very lightweight and let my skin breathe, it did get a little oily on my skin after a little while but blotting my face fixed that easily.  It easily became one of my go to foundations! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have had problem skin for a long time. I break out even in my 30&#x27;s and have mild scarring on my cheeks and large pores. Makeup used to exaggerate these issues and I tried everything but it irritates my sensitive skin. Then I used this. It is the most amazing foundation I have ever used and is a great price. I use an extra layer just on breakout areas and set the makeup by buffing a mineral powder over it. I don&#x27;t even need concealer anymore thanks to this. Where every makeup made my skin look bumpy and pore filled my skin looks much more natural, poreless and smooth. It lasts from 6 a.m to midnight and looks fantastic and matte but doesn&#x27;t look fake like a lot of others I tried. I don&#x27;t even wear primer anymore. I just use a light moisturizer before applying and perfect skin awaits!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Its light weight and feels amazing on my face. Thank you influenster!</li>
    <li> I received this free for testing purposes from Influenster. The shade I was sent did not match me but I did already own this foundation and I personally love it! It keeps me shine free all day and looks so natural! An absolute must have for anyone! I will be repurchasing it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this foundation. I can confidently say that this is my new holy-grail foundation! Unlike most foundations, this foundation looks better the longer you wear it. I applied this foundation using my beauty blender and was able to achieve flawless looking skin. It instantly gives you that &amp;#34;glow from within&amp;#34; look that everyone seeks to achieve. I have combination/oily skin and this foundation controls my oil, giving me healthy and vibrant looking skin. I have never been able to find a product to give me such radiant looking skin without causing me to become oily throughout my t-zone. I wore this foundation for over 10 hours and did not notice any settling, separation, or spots where it had rubbed off. My only complaint with this foundation was that I did notice a slight acne breakout along my cheeks the next day. However, it was not enough to keep me away from repurchasing such a wonderful and beautiful product. The price of this foundation is great for the quality that you are getting! I would definitely compare this to some of my higher end foundations. I am so grateful that Influenster sent me this product to test and review for free because I am absolutely in love with it and it will be a staple in my makeup routines from now on.</li>
    <li> Loved it!Easy to blend and looked very natural!</li>
    <li> I received ‪#‎COVERGIRL‬&#x27;s Ready, Set Gorgeous free from @COVERGIRL &amp; @Influenster, my opinions are my own, ‪#‎instaGLAM‬ is correct, this foundation covers well and it&#x27;s great for everyday use!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to try from Influesnter. I&#x27;m and very glad I was chosen to try this product because I fell in love with it. It feels nice on my skin and does not leave me feeling or looking cakey. The coverage is also great too! This product is wonderful and I would recommend it to everyone. Also, they have a lot of shades so its easy to find your color.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this foundation!!! I am so pleasantly surprised. The price, the coverage, the finish, the buildability, the color match... Just yes.&lt;br /&gt; I am acne prone, very hormonal, uneven skin (both in color and texture), and oily/ combo (very oily t zone, with dry patches).&lt;br /&gt; I bounce back and forth between my MAC pro Longwear, revlon Colorstay, and Covergirl outlast 3 in 1 mostly. I like full coverage, and oil control/ a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt; I try a lot of products in between, those are just what I always fall back to. The MAC one is more of a treat, since I&#x27;m no rich girl! I usually keep it around, but use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt; I bought this Ready Set Gorgeous foundation at my local Walmart, and for around $7, I did not expect much. I just like to try new things, and the claim to oil reduction caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt; I tried it with a beauty blender, and I liked it. I tried it with my Real Techniques buffing brush and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt; It is a medium coverage, and even though I go for full coverage, with a second light layer over problem areas, and a colored powder lightly applied, the coverage is great.&lt;br /&gt; It didn&#x27;t cake up on me like some others so after another layer. It dried pretty quick, but was easy to blend. The finish when it sets its a very nice, matte, almost powdery look. But not flat matte, TOO matte on my textured skin can actually exaggerate my raised areas and bumps. But this seems to actually smooth out the appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt; I love that it&#x27;s buildable, but still looks pretty natural. More so than a lot of foundations I have used.&lt;br /&gt; I did still use my MAC pro longwear concealer for my major problem spots, but I use that with everything. It&#x27;s my favorite concealer.&lt;br /&gt; I did also set it with my MAC mineralize skin finish natural in Light Plus. That is my go to powder, and I always set with a powder, to help control my oils. Although, I will say, with this foundation, I think I might be able to get away with no powder. I haven&#x27;t tested that, but the finish makes me think it would work.&lt;br /&gt; I did set it with rimmel stay matte powder on one occasion, and that worked great as well. I just prefer the more true to skin look of the mineralize skin finish.&lt;br /&gt; This foundation stays put very nicely, and it is lightweight. Even with layering and additional products on top, it did not feel heavy on my face.&lt;br /&gt; It did not seem to stick to or exaggerate my dry patches either.&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this foundation! You really can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
    <li> Feels very nice on skin, has a yellow-ish undertone which I appreciated because most make me look orange.</li>
    <li> This formula works for me - I have combination skin, but always have moisturizer on before applying foundation, and I set my foundation with finishing powder and a bit of silica powder, so it doesn&#x27;t move all day. I normally do use this shade in Covergirl products (the lightest one that ends in &amp;#34;05&amp;#34;) so I knew the shade would work for me.</li>
    <li> The most PERFECT foundation</li>
