      <li>This mask is not any different from a cheap farmacy mask like Pantene and is 8 times more expensive.</li>
      <li>Whereas Chroma Riche is thick and creamy, this is more watery, like a cream rinse.  </li>

    <li> Kerastase Chroma Riche is my favorite conditioner. I notice a huge difference in the shine, texture, and health of my long hair when I use it regularly. I bought this formula, thinking it was in the same family and wouldn&#x27;t make a big difference, and I was wrong. This conditioner is thin (unlike the thick chroma riche) and does not deep condition my hair. I don&#x27;t notice a difference at all in shine when I use it, and find my generally low-maintenance hair incredibly difficult to manage after even leaving it on for 20-30 minutes (which is NOT the case with chroma riche), like I hadn&#x27;t conditioned at all. I think my hair is shinier and nicer looking when I use Neutrogena&#x27;s deep treatment mask, which I was using after I ran out of the chroma riche I bought at the salon. Save your money and buy a drugstore mask, or buy chroma riche from a salon. I threw my bottle in the trash after 3 uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Keratase Chroma Riche a long time, and LOVE the way it makes my hair so silky.  However, I ordered this product, Chroma Captive, by mistake and the results aren&#x27;t the same.  Whereas Chroma Riche is thick and creamy, this is more watery, like a cream rinse.  And the conditioning isn&#x27;t as deep in the hair.  It works ok, but didn&#x27;t really help maintain my color or give me that extra special shine I&#x27;m paying for.  Skip this product and buy Pantene, or search for Chroma Riche and experience real results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make much of a difference to my dry hair...Very nice scent though</li>
    <li> I have used this product (or its earlier variations) for a number of years.  It will gently take great care of your hair.  Leaves it shiny and very managable.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews about this product being a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; and I said to myself...whatever, these people are crazy. NOPE, its true. This stuff is fake.</li>
    <li> The container is identical to what I buy at my salon, but the contents are pink and not white like I&#x27;m used to.</li>
    <li> I used to use this years ago and thought I&#x27;s try it again.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same, and the color and texture are different.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair masque i have ever used! Not heavy, doesn&#x27;t way hair down and smells so good! Hair is shiney and manageable!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use it once a week. Leaves my hair soft and shiny. It&#x27;s one of the best treatments I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love this masque. I actually use it as a conditioner every time I wash my hair. You only need a tiny bit so it lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I see results after the first use. My hair looks helthier! It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> over time, it really helped my color treated hair. i see a noticeable difference after a month of use. great</li>
    <li> Love it, cannot live without it! Changed my hair!</li>
    <li> I haev my hair professionally colored and use this to keep the color and not damage my hair.  Love the product!  I see that CVS now carries Kerastase products -- what&#x27;s next?  Wal-Mart?</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like it was the real product and wasn&#x27;t very thick for a mask I needed to use a lot</li>
    <li> Really makes your hair healthy and behave better.</li>
    <li> I get onderful results.  And it is safe to use after a Brazilian Blowout.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> The one they send me it was pink water!&lt;br /&gt;I have use it the product before, and I knew it was not like that.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the bomb... just so expensive.  Makes my hair SUPER soft and manageable.  I have long hair and hate to have my hair pulled when wet trying to get out tangles.. this helps tremendously.</li>
    <li> the product helps to keep the hair hidrated, but is not the last call in terms of treatment. It does what it says.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves using it on her hair. Keeps the hair soft, silky and frizz free.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work much but fast delivery!!!!smells really&lt;br /&gt;Good!</li>
    <li> You can buy any drug store hair mask or deep conditioner &amp; get the same results. I have long hair and can not see or feel any difference between this product and Pantene.</li>
    <li> The mask itself is nice and works well it just does not last long at all.  I have long thick hair and this didnt even last a month.</li>
    <li> Super nice company to deal with&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken back my original review, it was meant for a different company</li>
    <li> Not the same as in the salons.</li>
    <li> This mask is not any different from a cheap farmacy mask like Pantene and is 8 times more expensive. I have colored hair and make mine oily but not hydrated. NO, it does not work</li>
    <li> It is pretty good but I like chroma riche better.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t perform as well as the other masque in this Bain Chroma line.  I can&#x27;t remember the name, but it is white and thicker in texture, and makes my hair feel like teflon.  This is more of a thick pink creme rinse and didn&#x27;t make my hair rinse out slick n smooth like the other masque which happens to be much more expensive.  I know this product is good for my highly-processed, vividly colored (purple &amp; silver) hair, so I will continue to use it.  It was a good deal.</li>
    <li> Heard a lot of great reviews about this product from my hair stylist friends, so decided to give it a try. I dye my hair darker monthly and needed to rehydrate my ends. Immediately after putting the masque on my hair I saw results, but upon natural air drying (no blow dryer) i saw no major results or changes in my hair quality. It made my hair feel finer and I have thick wavy hair. I have been using this product for 2 months, probably won&#x27;t re-order. I will stick to Moroccan Oil. As for Amazon seller, Shipment was quick and efficient. Good customer service.</li>
    <li> made my fine hair really manageable w/ alot of body.  smells good.  don&#x27;t have to use a lot.  leave on as long as possible when in shower</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing- helps my color treated hair become soft and manageable! It was recommended to leave it on overnite</li>
    <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
