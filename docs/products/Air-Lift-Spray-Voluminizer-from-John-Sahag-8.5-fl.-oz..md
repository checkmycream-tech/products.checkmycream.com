    <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for years and found it easier to order it on Amazon than to find a shop that carried it.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine and thin hair.  It is one of the few products I have found that does not weigh it down.</li>
    <li> I love this air lift, I have fine thin hair and it brings volume.</li>
    <li> Could someone tell me if this product is supposed to be yellow in color?  I purchased this and its yellow in color and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s working for me like everyone says. My hairdresser thinks it should be clear and maybe I received an old product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Use spray in summer and gel in winter b</li>
    <li> In addition to adding a little bit of volume, this will make your hair shiny and hold it&#x27;s style better too.  Unlike a lot of volumizing products, it won&#x27;t make your hair sticky.  Your hair will feel like it&#x27;s clean, and you can run your fingers through it.  I really love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I tried this product after it was suggested by my mother and have absolutely loved it!!!  I do not ususally like to have hair products in my hair but I simply spray before hairdrying and I never know it is there except for the incredible volume it adds to my hair.  It is a must!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Good for thin hair. can scrunch and it becomes wavy.</li>
    <li> Love anything Sahag.  I&#x27;m a regular user of the shampoos and volumizer, but it&#x27;s just not easy to find around town, so it&#x27;s worth the time and wait ordering.  GREAT PRODUCT for those like me with fine limp hair.</li>
    <li> Air Lift is a product that I have using for a few years.  I am not happy with this version of Solitaire because it comes with Pop-Ups!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It was introduced to me by my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really adds lift.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This has the right amount of hold for my fine hair without weighing it down. I use it with a light mousse which is perfect for thickening my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and this product holds well, without a thick build up.</li>
    <li> Gives hair volume without weighing down</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, but fine.  So, getting enough lift in the front is always an issue with me.  If I don&#x27;t use this product after shampooing my hair goes completely flat in about an hour.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve found over the years.  It isn&#x27;t sticky or gummy or drying. You just spray it on the roots where you want lift. One bottle lasts a long time, too.&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
    <li> Perfect weight and hold for my fine hair. Third bottle. I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really a great product.</li>
    <li> Love this product - it holds your hair without making it gummy or sticky.  A wonderful poduct and very hard to find locally- only one shop about 25 miles from me carries this product, so was very happy to find it on Amazon .</li>
