<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great and really hydrates my skin!</li>
    <li> Like the fresh fragrance and lightness which is perfect for daytime, but not sure of it&#x27;s effectiveness anti-aging wise. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost and therefore probably wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> I agree with other customers that I dont believe this product is the real thing</li>
    <li> Love how healing this feels!</li>
    <li> WARNING, WARNING WILL ROBINSON (sorry, a Lost in Space reference - I couldn&#x27;t help myself!). This product is NOT THE REAL DEAL!!! I&#x27;VE USED THE REAL VITAL C PRODUCTS AND THEY ARE AWESOME - THESE ARE NOT! !!</li>
    <li> Authentic product.  Absorbs right away.  Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> smells really good and hydrates without being greasy</li>
    <li> 1. great consistancy&lt;br /&gt;2. wonderful smell&lt;br /&gt;3. good size will last a while&lt;br /&gt;4. love Image Skin Care products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... I have oily/ combo skin and sometimes after putting this on (after washing/ exfoliating) it feels like it just sits on the surface of my skin and adds to the oiliness. Until I can find a great reputable product like this one that doesn&#x27;t add to my already oily skin then I will be &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; with Image.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for almost  a year now and love it. I was introduced by a place where I got my facial done.  Before using this lotion, my face was really oily and shinny and now it looks soft, smooth, evenly, and glowing.</li>
    <li> This is new packaging from the last one I had. The new pump is great. I also love the smell of this product!</li>
    <li> So far, the product I received is authentic and is exactly just like the Image Vital C Hydrating Anti-Aging Serum that I got from the spa. I had  bottle that I bought from my aesthetician that is almost running out so I purchased this from Amazon for $20 less. The bottle that I received from Amazon is the silver cap and the scent and consistency is exactly the same as the one that I got from the spa/aesthetician. This seller/Amazon would probably need to update their product picture because Image Vital C has changed their packaging to the silver cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will buy it from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after getting my first acne facial done. This citrusy serum is of cream consistency and goes on smooth. I have seen vast improvements in my skin - the texture is a LOT smoother and my dark spots have faded (not completely but definitely noticeable). This isn&#x27;t one of those oily products that leave your skin feeling gross, it is very light and absorbs well. It lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to those looking for a dark spot fading solution and smoother skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Used it for quite awhile as part of morning skin care.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and is of the highest quality. I love it! Very clean aroma, hydrating and very little is needed to be effective.</li>
    <li> I love this C cream!  I have ordered is several times now!</li>
    <li> I truly love this lotion and thank god Amazon sells it now. I have used it on and off for the last 7 years and it is definitely the best everyday lotion out there. I stopped using it for a year because I moved and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere that sold it online. I tried DDF and a million other way more expensive lotions and I saw that Amazon started selling this and I switched back right away. I&#x27;m 27 with fair skin and it never makes me break out or anything.</li>
    <li> This lotion is light non- greasy yet still moisturizes. My skin looks and feels younger after just a few weeks. It soothes my rosacea and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts as many lotions do. Best of all it smells like fresh oranges.</li>
    <li> This is the first serum that I have found that I really enjoy.  It&#x27;s a must for keeping your face hydrated.</li>
    <li> Not sure it&#x27;s the real product. The cap and pump are different from what I usually use and obtain through my esthetician. Fragrance Is the same but fluid is thinner.</li>
    <li> This worked great in the beginning.  I seem to have hit a plateau.  Will continue using for now.</li>
    <li> I really love the non greasy and silky feeling of how this goes on my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried others but keep coming back to this one as it works wonderful with my sensitive skin and Rosacea.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> This Vital C Hydrating Anti Aging Serum has a wonderful feel and it makes my face very soft and supple.  I will buy this again and again.  Quick delivery too!!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and refreshing orange scent. Lightweight and non-greasy</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this cream!</li>
    <li> I was worried about the expiration date, since the price was so good, but it&#x27;s over a year out! Woot woot!</li>
    <li> Product was as described and shipped quickly</li>
    <li> This product certainly adds hydrating to the skin. I use it in the morning under my sunscreen because because I use an acne medication at night which dries my skin out.</li>
    <li> This is my everyday face lotion. It smells great, all natural, and all that. In winter, I find it to be less effective as I still get flaky using it, but it does work overall.</li>
    <li> A very light moisturizer for day wear and under makeup.  Smells awesome!</li>
    <li> I love this face wash.  I alternate between this and Cetaphil.  Vitamin C in a natural anti-ager.  It is a natural acid.  I am not board certified or anything but I do know my skin products and I would definitely recommend this face wash along with the vitamin c serum from same brand.</li>
    <li> This serum is really amazing. My (rosacea) skin has improved significantly. My face feels smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product but beware that if it&#x27;s from an unauthorized selling source (this includes Amazon, ebay), it may NOT be the authentic product. Image only sells to licensed aestheticians, doctors, and spas. Here is their contact if you are in doubt or need to locate an authorized seller in your area: 800 796-SKIN (7546).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a light, yet, very hydrating product and has helped minimize my sun spots. I&#x27;ve been having this dull look on my forehead, also, and it&#x27;s only been a little-over-a-week of usage and my forehead looks brighter and toner. It&#x27;s really a great skin care regimen to prevent premature aging.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product loyally for over 5 years and have been a fan. Upon receiveing my last order, it appears the company has changed the packaging and it now comes with a cheap pump-mechanism that doesn&#x27;t push the product out! It does not work at all. Thus, everytime I use it, I have to take the top off and dump some of the serum into my hand. It is very wasteful to me but (and maybe I&#x27;m a cynic) from the company&#x27;s perspective, means you&#x27;ll go through the product faster, have to order more frequently and they&#x27;ll make more money. So, I will be calling their bluff and will stop using their product. Its a good product; NOT a GREAT product and it is surely substitutable for higher quality, better value skin care lines.</li>
    <li> I first learned about this product during a facial and haven&#x27;t been able to find a product that comes close to it yet.  It is perfect for keeping FL sun kissed skin hydrated!</li>
    <li> Keeps your skin looking young</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff .</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Vital C after getting a lovely facial with my local aesthetician, and loved it! I used that first container to the very last bit and was amazed by the improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I knew I was probably taking a chance buying it online this time, but I thought I would give it a shot since it&#x27;s significantly less expensive. And it&#x27;s just okay. It&#x27;s either a knockoff or significantly diluted; the orange smell is not nearly as pronounced (I love the smell!) and it simply doesn&#x27;t leave me face as glowy after I swipe it on.&lt;br /&gt;I will be going back to the aesthetician- it&#x27;s worth every penny for the real thing. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Was delivered in timely fashion.  I have used this before and loved it.  It has a fresh smell and I like the feel on my skin.</li>
    <li> I like the products from this company! They are not too over priced for well made skin care products packed with quality ingredients. I wear this one on top on the Hyaluronic Acid from Image and they seem to pair together nicely. This smells so good I could eat it! And it is silky and just a little bit is enough to moisturize my skin. I give it 4 out of 5 because it hasn&#x27;t totally irradicated my every wrinkle (!) but I think it&#x27;s a nice compliment to my skin care regime.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face every day. I love the Image skin care line and especially love this. A little dab will do ya!</li>
    <li> Since using, started to develop pimples on my face- the one I bought at the Salon before this didn&#x27;t do that. It is the only thing different ive done lately with my skin care. I don&#x27;t know if it is the product, but I do not ever have breakouts on my skin. Go figure?</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a great smell and has a smooth application, although I didn&#x27;t feel like it was that amazing moisturizer I have been looking for. It didn&#x27;t get rid of some dry patchy spots on my face. Recently I found some moisturizers that work like a miracle from Paula&#x27;s Choice!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three years with good results.  I&#x27;ve been buying it from my esthetician for $50.00 so I think $35.00 is a good deal.  I recently followed her to another salon and a similar product there was over $100.00 so I&#x27;m sticking with this.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this serum by a beauty therapist about 6 - 7 weeks ago.  I was treating rosacea with a gel which left my face feeling very dry.  I have been taking antibiotics for the last number of years prior to the gel.  I am now only using the serum and have not had a breakout - marvelous result and well worth the price.  Love it and the lovely smell when you put it on</li>
    <li> This was not a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; consistency, it was more like a lotion. The orange smell was overwehlming and too perfume scented. Also the packaging it arrived in was not secure as the bottle had leaked/damaged.</li>
    <li> It makes me skin so radiant and gives it a glow. I love the citrus smell of it also. I have been using it for 3 years and seen a difference since then.</li>
    <li> Hello all, do not buy image skin care products online!! These are not authorized retailers and there is no guarantee of the freshness and quality of each product. Please see your nearest skincare specialist or a dermatologists office or plastic surgeon near you! You will not be paying any more money than you are on here and you know the product you are using is fresh and you can be sure you are using the right products for your skin conditions!</li>
    <li> This Vital C serum is superb. I have been using for over a year now and have added new ageless products to my skincare line.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel 100% the same as the vital c serum that I had used previously. The smell is a lighter scent.It also doesn&#x27;t feel as thick &amp; coated a little lighter.The bottle looked slightly different but companies do change packaging from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the previous version but this was still a decent buy. I&#x27;m not sure if its like a situation where the company discontinues 1 &amp; comes out with another.ie.Bath&amp;Body Works Freeshia-vs-Sheer Freeshia. I liked the old dont really care for the new 1. I wish companies would quit changing something that&#x27;s not broken &amp; never discontinue a good thing. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what has happened here.  Over all its still a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Ben using it for 2 years. Feels great on skin!&lt;br /&gt;Light and moisturizing. Small bottle, but lasts a long time. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I love this heavier night cream, very soothing to the skin</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy this online as Image Skincare does not sell online. But I took a chance and am so glad did. I love Image Skincare line to being with, I checked the expiration date on this and it was fine. Also, the packaging was great and opaque as vitamin C things should be. Glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> Very light and absorbs quickly.  Your face feels very fresh and hydrated.  I add a little heavier lotion after I apply this product.  The scent is light and clean - orange scent.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using Image skin care products, I have seen much improvement in my skin quality.  I&#x27;d recommend this product line.</li>
    <li> I love it, no complaints!! Great to use as day and night crème. Hydrates, light, non heavy crème. Will continue to order.</li>
    <li> I was a dedicated member of our local Facelogic facial spa.  I looked forward to my facials every month.  Then they suddenly closed, and I was cast adrift.  I found that I could order my favorite products on line, and my face was happy.  The Vital C product line is excellent.  I recommend it to all women &amp;#34;of a certain age&amp;#34; who wish to retain youthful skin, and look radiant.</li>
    <li> Id like to know why the ingredients on website says it contains Retinyl Palmitate but not here on amazon description?  Does it contain vitamin A or not?  What about the Salicylic acid?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: 15% L-Ascorbic Acid Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate Ascorbyl Vitamin C antiooxidants Palmitoyl Pentapeptide Matrixyl- amino acid rejuvenation Hyaluronic Acid Hydrates- Binds 1000x Water Retinyl Palmitate Vitamin a- skin revitalizer Salicylic Acid BHA exfoliator Alpha Lipoic Acid Anti-oxidant Ceramide 3 Forms protector barrier, reducing transepidermal water loss Super Oxide Dismutase Enzyme that fights free radicals</li>
    <li> I first used this while visiting my mom and I had forgot to bring face lotion. After a few days of using this at night, I noticed that my face seemed more radiant, and as cheesy as that sounds, its the truth. It really works. I am only 32 so I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles yet, but I noticed a visible difference with this product. A healthy glow. A few friends of mine asked me what I was doing differently, and I was excited to share this with them! I would recomend this product to anyone. It goes on really smooth, and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite line of skin care products.  I love the smell and how it brightens my skin without it feeling heavy or oily.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product by my Spa Esthetician. I love the clean orange aroma and the light weight texture. It just feels good!!</li>
    <li> It keeps my face moist almost all day and all night, using it under the &amp;#34;sheer ceramide.&amp;#34;.  Feels good; not skicky&lt;br /&gt;like some products. The price is right, too.</li>
    <li> I am a Licensed Esthetician in my late 20s.  I&#x27;ve suffered with breakouts and oily skin my entire life.  I was introduced to the Vital C Serum when a friend of mine (also an esthetician) gave me a sample of some Image Skin Care products.  I fell in love with this lightweight, yet effecting and hydrating serum.  The vitamin C in this serum is top notch and it has lightened my hyperpigmentation significantly.  I am in love with this serum and use it morning and night.  Definitely a HG product for me!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Best vitamin c serum I&#x27;ve used. Smell is wonderful! My skin tone is so smooth and even.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. feels good and it works</li>
    <li> Been using for awhile but buying at 2x the price.  Wonderful scent and does amazing things to your skin. Does make your skin look less lines.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and lasts a long time. Spreads smooth and easy . Love the smell it&#x27;s so refreshing!,,</li>
    <li> Like the serum, this goes on so smooth and smells so good, love this product! Used to buy it at the Spa but Amazon has a better price so I am sticking with Amazon for these Image products from now on!</li>
    <li> I have used this for months now. I like it for night and day. But it doesn&#x27;t have a sun screen in it or beware. I love the smell and the moisture it gives.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product online since I could not purchase it from my esthetician, i paid $26.00 + shipping of $6.00, and it lasted 5 days.  DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON......</li>
    <li> This is very light weight and good after a facial, non comedogenic, and less expensive than buying at the derm.</li>
    <li> I like the Image Vital C line and the fact that it came so soon with Amazon Prime and at a good price.</li>
    <li> This is different than the product I bought originally through a spa. Was told this company does not allow their product to be sold if not a dealer and a lot of what you find online is knock off. This isn&#x27;t the same product. It smells sort of similar, but packaging is completely different and consistency and even color is different! Don&#x27;t like the way it makes my skin feel compared to original purchased. Disappointed..</li>
    <li> I love this serum, especially in the summertime. I use it as a day creme as recommended by my esthetician.</li>
    <li> Have you changed something in the serum?  It seemed very thin compared to the 1st &amp; 2nd container I had.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my daughter in law.  It&#x27;s a product she loves but can no longer afford so.... the price was great.</li>
    <li> It seems to be the same product as I get locally but much cheaper. Happy with it so far! Will probably order again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and love it. I just wish I would have found it sooner.</li>
    <li> Great product . Great service</li>
    <li> Light weight product that works on both dryness and wrinkles. I love the orange scent of all products also. Package last for months.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is very healing for skin! I had bad breakouts and scars an it help reduce both! Plus when I did breakout, and if I picked at it, it helps heal my skin much faster!</li>
    <li> Great product, great prices also on all their line of products.</li>
    <li> IVE RECENTLY HAD A MICRO LAZER PEEL DONE TO MY FACE WITH WONDERFUL RESULTS. USING THESE PRODUCTS ARE WHAT IS RECOMMENDED TO HELP KEEP MY FACE HYDRATED &amp; THEY DO. I JUST RECENTLY STARTED SHOPPING ON LINE WHEN I RAN OUT. THE BEAUTY SHOP RAN OUT AND IT WAS BACK ORDERED. I COULDNT GO THAT LONG SO WHEN I CHECKED ONLINE IT WAS CHEAPER ALSO SO IT WAS A WIN WIN FOR ME ALL THE WAY AROUND!:)</li>
    <li> This is the Best Product ever........when I found out I could get it on Amazon I was surprised. But I was even more amazed at the quick service in being able to receive it so fast.</li>
    <li> Very good as a moisturizer.  Time will tell how it affects my skin  Trying to reduce redness in my cheeks.</li>
    <li> I use this all over my face, my neck and my upper chest.  Please smell, absorbs quickly so it can be used under moisturizer or sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Disappointed as to how runny it was.  Previously, it was more creamy.  Always makes me wonder, are we getting &#x27;seconds&#x27; when buying on the internet and paying lower prices, which aren&#x27;t exactly low anyway.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my facial therapist. I used it for almost 3 months and I start to notice the diminishing of the dark spot on my cheek. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great vitamin C moisturizer at a good price. The vitamin C works as my dermatologist said it would - brightens my aging skin. I think it would be a great moisturizer for any age.    My pores clog easily. I eventually went with an inexpensive oil free moisturizer into which I would drop one drop of vit C serum. This is a slightly cheaper, better route for me. If you don&#x27;t have my extreme tendency toward clogged pores, this lightweight, wonderful and well priced moisturizer is the way to go. I have tried many vit C moisturizers including those from Kiehls, Sephora, etc. This is the best value for price.</li>
    <li> Works well for my skin in combination with the hydrating repair creme</li>
    <li> this is my fountain of youth.  it&#x27;s not a miracle cure but definitely has a healing effect and lightens dark spots over time.</li>
    <li> I love these products. My face has never looked so good before. Vitamin C is good for all skin types.</li>
    <li> Helped clear up dark spots on my skin. Easily absorbed into my skin. Brightened my skin. Face was glowing after use.</li>
    <li> Love the product really hydrates. Excellent Price point.</li>
    <li> I had a sample of this serum and really liked it, that is why i bought it. It absorbs quickly and I love the fresh scent. My face feels smoother and looks brighter.</li>
    <li> It smells so good and feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is a good product. Very happy with my order.</li>
    <li> I love Image Vital C Hydrating Anti Aging Serum.  It makes my face soft and makes my skin glow!  I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This company knows skin care. The products are amazing and they work so well together. They smell amazing and my skin absorbs all the yummy ingredients, like it was made just for me. I have been using this one everyday for over 3 years. Nothing compares to it. Start today, you are worth it. (I&#x27;m 52 years old and I still get carded) I recommend all the &amp;#34;Orange label&amp;#34; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my personal skin care kit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Image Skin Care Vital C Hydrating Repair Creme 2 oz&lt;br /&gt;Image Skin care Ormedic Balancing Lip Enhancement Complex 0.25 oz&lt;br /&gt;Image Ageless Total Eye Lift Creme, 0.5 Fluid Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Image Vital C Hydrating Enzyme Masque 2OZ&lt;br /&gt;Image Skin care Ageless Total Pure Hyaluronic Filler (New Packaging) 1 oz</li>
    <li> Love it, love it. definitely recommend it to everyone. Does wonders for the skin. skin feels very refreshed after using it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for your face!  It&#x27;s not greasy, flows on easy and helps reduce lines.  You do not need much.  It is not highly fragrant.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product as well as the price.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but not like what I have bought at the spas.</li>
    <li> A great product 1st recommended thru mu esthetician.</li>
    <li> Hydrating and renewing for aged and tired skin! Great and effective product.</li>
    <li> Use at night on top of Vital C repair crème for extra hydration. Using the Vit C enzyme mask once a week on top of this regimen keeps my skin hydrated and looking good!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I use this doing the day under my tinted SPF face cream.</li>
    <li> Feels good, smells good, works.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product.  And it is the only thing I&#x27;ve been able to use on my face on a consistent basis without it making me break out.  I like it so much I&#x27;ve purchase some for my sister.</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer!  Leaves my face silky soft without a trace of greasiness.  I highly recommend for anyone with mature skin.</li>
    <li> This product is pricey, but well worth the expense.  I love that it smells like fresh oranges. I have extremely dry skin, and it does a good job of hydrating. It was recommended by my spa therapist. Besides smelling fantastic, I like the fact that vitamin c has infection protection.</li>
    <li> This is the best  Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve found especially for the price. Goes on smooth, light, refreshing and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;All other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen and tried were much more expensive.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and so I knew it would be great.  I will order again from you.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great price and product</li>
    <li> This product smells very nice and is easy to use.  I use on my face, neck and décolletage. One press of the pump does all.</li>
    <li> great feel, smell, and protection for very dry, rosacea skin - which doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;it feels calm to my face, light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> A light serum for hydrating the skin.  Works well and requires such a small amount that it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I use this serum every morning after cleansing.  It not only contains vitamin C but also A and E creating a blend of antioxidants to protect the skin from free radical damage.  This serum is also safe for anyone with sensitive skin.  I have redness in my cheeks and this has helped calm it down.  I&#x27;m hoping it will help with acne scars too.  I like the lightweight feeling of this serum and also the orange scent.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference right away.  I hope you will offer the two companion products, the moisturizer and the repair cream.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is a must in my regime every morning and evening.  It really provides a healthy glow and my skin feels so clean!</li>
    <li> great product.  received quickly.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> My skin didn&#x27;t absorb it at all and it only made it red/dry. I will never use this again. I guess this doesn&#x27;t work on everybody..</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this serum.  I like to call it &amp;#34;Heaven in a bottle!&amp;#34;  It is fabulous.  I am addicted to this stuff.  I use one pump nightly after a shower.  It is great and so refreshing for the skin, smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I started out with the starter kit and loved it but after almost months of use no real difference .</li>
    <li> Great daily light moisturizer, no trouble using this on my sensitive skin. I wear this daily!! the smell is nice too!</li>
    <li> been using this product for almost a year.  Smells great, non-greasy, absorbs really well, skin feels hydrated and my complexion has improved.  it works if you dont mind the price...kind of high. my skin is very oily but this product never makes me break out.  Very light weight.</li>
    <li> After getting a facial Image skin care line was recommended to me &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for several months. I had a few peels done over the course of 3 months and now my face has stopped breaking out as much! Now working on clearing the blemishes. It may be a little pricey but is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This really hydrates my skin!</li>
    <li> Serum makes my skin tingle and with other Vital C has greatly improved my skin. Will not do without this cream!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Delivered quickly from the seller.  I would definitely use this merchant again when ordering.  Vital C hydrates your face.  Perfect for individuals that have dry skin on their face and want more Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know if it really works.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use several products from the Image Vital C line as they work really well for me.  I use this serum after I wash my face and then I follow it up with their moisturizer - excellent combination for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before and love that it has vitamin C for my skin but doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.  Some moisturizers and serums I&#x27;ve tried have left my skin feeling &amp;#34;suffocated&amp;#34; and greasy but not this product.  Will definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> refreshing amazing smells good feel good love this stuff so much! will use it forever was recommended by my facialist</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels on my skin.  I apply it right after washing and rinsing my face each morning and night.</li>
    <li> It is great to use morning or night. It makes your skin glow! It is really light weight and awesome!</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing...it&#x27;s light has a lovely orange scent and it really does improve the skins appearance after  continued daily use. I use it under my day and night cream...I usually let it soak in completely before applying my day or night cream. Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> This is more of a lotion. It goes on smoothly, hydrating, and has a lovely orange smell.  And the best part of all Vitamin C and A are for hyperpigmentation and brightening as this is a medical grade product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as part of my Korean/Asian skincare routine as the emulsion part (which is a lotion). I follow with a sunscreen (I use the Image one) for day and cream at night.</li>
    <li> I love this serum have been using it for several years now.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer for sensitive skin &amp; does not weigh down-very light, but does the job. With the cleanser, helps with redness &amp; minimizes pores.</li>
    <li> Great product..smell is kind of strong. Product smells like oranges which is great at first,but daily use the smell is overwhelming!</li>
    <li> great skin care product</li>
    <li> I love this product have been using for years. I found on line for slightly less then my esticians salon so I purchased, and will continue to do so - to save a few dollars. Otherwise I knew the product already and love it.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance of this product.  Like you are eating an orange.  This product makes your face feel so smooth.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware!  NOT the real thing!  Only buy from a licensed esthetician or doctor!  This is not a real image product!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. Super great price! So much cheaper than my local spa! Will be buying again from you guys! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I love this line. the Vital C is great, the price is not as expensive as those high end brand cost but this works 10X better and smells great too.</li>
    <li> Vital C smells great and makes your skin feel hydrated and smooth without a heavy film feel.  This is salon brand purchased cheaper through Amazon.  I would highly recommend this product.  Prompt, no hassle delivery.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this at my botox doc&#x27;s office.  It smells faintly of oranges and it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  Previously I used Clinique and it was good, but this is lighter and better.  It NEVER clogs my pores; perfect under make-up.</li>
    <li> I helped my friend buy this product, and she sent me the link of the product at the price $42 but when I pay, I paid $53/1 item. What is the error here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Quynh</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for all skin types. Rosacea, aging, sensitive, dehydrated, and even oily and combination. However, please take my advise as a licensed professional who works with these products. Do not buy from online sources. I would recommend going to a spa that sells the product because IMAGE does not sell via online resources. IMAGE only sells to licensed Physicians and Estheticians. The product you purchase could be watered down or tampered with anywhere other than its original source. Just an FYI. CorePower Yoga and Spa sells this product in MN. Talk to a skin are professional. You end up spending WAY MORE money by not educating yourself on the product in the first place and purchasing a thousand different creams and serums before realizing you simply needed to know a few key ingredients for your specific skin type.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this to anyone.  It made my face break out and turned my neck red.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> this hydrates well without leaving your skin feeling like you put anything on it.  i love all the image products</li>
    <li> Wife wanted it.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;Wife happy and pretty!&lt;br /&gt;Happy life as well:-)</li>
    <li> I have used this Image line for three plus years now. I have purchased it from a local spa and the price jumps up by an extra twenty dollars by doing this. I received my package on time and it was packaged well. NOW TO THE PRODUCT REVIEW. I have used this product for years, really!!! I have very sensitive skin. when I was younger I had acne breakouts. I find this product to truly give me a glow and adds a moisture to my skin. No oily residue, and amazing under makeup.  I am older now and my skin has changed, I seem to be getting very fine lines. Don&#x27;t run out of this product!!! when I run out of this product my skin feels dry and my skin does not have a glow. This product brightens the skin!!! My skin can get dull if I have gone close to a month without this product.</li>
    <li> I had a facial @ a salon and they used this product.  I really like the smell and makes my skin glow.</li>
    <li> This is the best serum on the market.  My Wellnes doctor recommended it for me and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I finally have found a product that helps my rosacea.  I use this morning and at night.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have sensitive skin and it has never bothered me. I use all the image c products and love them all.</li>
    <li> I notice changes in just a week. In love with this skincare line.</li>
    <li> The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.</li>
    <li> Noticed my skin felt and looked better.</li>
    <li> Great anti-aging night serum for normal skin. Delivered as expected.</li>
    <li> They are not real Image products. Only fake cheap stuff that they are trying to sell to people. Do not buy if you want a crazy reaction or damage on the skin. Bottles look like something I use but what&#x27;s inside is not the same. I thought I could switch from buying it at the salon but at least the lady who works on my face actually sells the real line of Image skin care.&lt;br /&gt;Image only sells it to professionals not online.</li>
    <li> Beautiful soft skin with a healthy glow after using this serum and zero irratation on my rosacea its brill and fab price</li>
    <li> I have always loved the vital c, and happy to find it on Amazon.  I did notice that the packaging is not hard/plastic like the ones I would buy from the medspa-so I don&#x27;t know if the packaging has recently changed or not?  Anyways-  my skin loves this stuff.  It feels wonderful and  immediately refreshes my skin.  I still follow up with eye cream-but I cant do without this stuff.  It makes my skin not feel tight or dry - it is just great.  It also smells nice-and no residue-just soaks right into the skin.</li>
    <li> Received it in a timely manner, thank you so much! I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always wary to try new skin products but I love this! My skin looks much brighter and all around healthy. I use this in addition to my daily moisturizer, just because my skin can get dry in the winter. But this can stand alone and me used as a moisturizer. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I can see a difference in my skin whenever I use it. It has a nice smell and the application is smooth &amp; make up can go right over it.</li>
    <li> Wife is never without it.  Says it helps keep the wrinkles away.  Okay.  Whatever.  If it makes her happy, why not.</li>
    <li> I apply this serum after cleansing in the morning, and in a moist climate it is all I need under my sun screen.  In the arid west, where I spend most of my time, it is a great first coat under moisturizer.  It lasts a long time, is a little creamier than many serum products, and isn&#x27;t too perfumey.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer, so light, smells great, and my skin feels refreshed.  So glad I found a place to buy online.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Image Vital C products (all of them, cleanser, serum, cream, scrub and mask).  AWESOME PRODUCTS.  my face has never looked better.  Very smooth and even and no breakouts.  I used to breakout with anything else.  GREAT PRODUCT LINE and good investment for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product! I love that I was able have it shipped to my door and not have to drive out of my way to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I am updating my previous review as I used this product for 6 months (that&#x27;s how long it lasted) and ended up really liking it.  I used it only at night after cleansing.  It was very nicely hydrating.  I found that it brightened my whole complexion into the next day and I often got compliments on my skin.  I did not use in the morning because of the intense year-round sun in Southern California -- vitamin C can apparently accelerate sun damage.   Note that I did not see any improvement in pigmentation on my face. Perhaps there are C serums out there that can really shrink age spots (hard to believe...) but this product definitely did not do that.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product, makes your skin feel so smooth, hydrated, protected and smells great.</li>
    <li> I like this product &amp; it is packaged well.</li>
    <li> I really like this product but it doesn&#x27;t have enough moisturizer in it for me. I need something in addition to this product - I like Image IMAX moisturizer as well.</li>
    <li> Saw results in 2 days! Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Great product , leave your skin nice and soft and fresh. You can see the bid differents in 2 weeks already .&lt;br /&gt;Your skin look younger and smoother .</li>
    <li> You can really tell it tightens up your face and it only takes a dab.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery for this great product. Been using this for a couple of years now and my skin is addicted to this serum. Great under any moisturizer or on its own.</li>
    <li> Very good product, use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I like the product because of its fragrance and its smoothness. I need it to take care of my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a daily moisturizer for years.  Nice citrus smell, non-greasy or heavy on your face.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Been using Image products for years.  Would recommend for all skin types.  Glad it&#x27;s available online.  Enjoy these products and</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year now and really like it.  I notice a visible difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Not sure why its rated so high, its just ok. I see no changes, and I wouldn&#x27;t say it feels amazing on my face. I will stick with Obagi c serum I used before when this one is done. I do have to say that it does last forever</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m 63 and have gotten many compliments on my face since I started using. It smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> This is the only facial moisturizer that I can use and it really helps my dry mature skin, love it.</li>
    <li> Image Skin Care products rank right up there with Lamer, excellent results.  The Vital C Hyrdrating Anti-aging Serum gives my skin exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> I never want to run out of this product! A little goes a long way, but&lt;br /&gt;I love to use it at least twice a day!!</li>
    <li> Good, but not amazing results.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day and I now have minimal breakouts. It controls my oily skin, and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> So great for smoothing out skin!</li>
    <li> Best Anti-aging cream on the market.  Love this product and love the quick turnaround on delivery.</li>
    <li> I am the Mrs. in the house, and I love this stuff!  very moisturizing without greasiness, and soothing for post treatment skin.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!! Anytime I run out and start to use other products, my skin always breaks out and developes dry patches.  This serum is amazing for  all of those issues!  My skin has never been smoother!  I use it with The Max cream (also by Image) at night and alone under makeup during the day.  I live in a humid climate and my dry skin doesn&#x27;t need any more moisture during the day.  Perfect serums for everyday use!</li>
    <li> Anything to keep us looking young. I love Image Skin Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl</li>
    <li> I have bought this product several times, It works great, absorbs quickly, I do have dry, 50 something skin.  It also smells wonderful, like oranges.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Great for rosacea.</li>
    <li> It had been recommended to me by a skin care specialist. I love the smell, but not sure if it is helping or not. I assume having the ingredients on my face is helpful.</li>
