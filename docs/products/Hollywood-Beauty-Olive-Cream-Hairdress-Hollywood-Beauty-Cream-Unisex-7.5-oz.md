      <li>great product and will be a staple in my regimen!!</li>
      <li>THE BEST BUY I&#x27;VE MADE SINCE MY BC(BIG CHOP).</li>
      <li>Works great on my thinning hair, bought it here because drug store stopped selling it.</li>
      <li>it works great.</li>
      <li>OK,FIRST OF ALL IT CHEAP!!!</li>
      <li>the scent is fairly pleasant and tolerable; you don&#x27;t smell it every time you move your head or when the wind blows like SOME</li>
      <li>good cause</li>
      <li>I guess it truly needs the hot sun to bring out its best properties.</li>
      <li>It kind of smells medicated to me.</li>

      <li>I love this product have been using it for months</li>
      <li>I say it&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Good product at a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>I love it and nice smell not greasy at hot all</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a light non oily/greasy non-clogging the hair follicles and \\&quot;non flamable\\&quot; product that my hubby could use on his hair.  </li>
      <li>great price (if bought in stores locally) and</li>
      <li>and it has a light scent.</li>
      <li>It so light</li>
      <li>Yet,  I got this free</li>
      <li>aren&#x27;t available in my area.</li>
      <li>Nothing special</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t find anything special about this product.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no petrolatum or mineral oil in it, so it really soaks into your hair versus just sitting on top of it.</li>
      <li>but after a quick scan of the ingredients (no mineral oil or petroleum) I decided to give it a shot.</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed being a product junkie &amp; buying all of the new &amp; pricier hair products from Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Shea Moisture &amp; others.</li>
      <li>This stuff has an ok smell and gives your waves that dark tent, however like I said before it dosent work so great that you should order it to replace your lusters pink which is easily found &amp; readily available unlike this stuff.</li>
      <li>but I am pleased with the product so far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;As stated, I was amazed by how my hair absorbed it as soon as it made contact with my hair.</li>
      <li>Makes my mini afro hair really soft, and really easy to comb through</li>
      <li>It was my first time using this.</li>
      <li>It worked very well in that hot sun and made my hair shine and retained moisture.  </li>
      <li>and it has really helped my scalp and hair feel super soft.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s even better applied on wet hair.</li>
      <li>and i really didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it over products i&#x27;ve purchased for twice as much.</li>
      <li>and it works great on wet hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair either.</li>
      <li>Sage just to name a few and it has a very light scent.  </li>
      <li>I Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My grand mom had a little jar of this laying around the house</li>
      <li>I see other good reviews and this product is cheaper than the other cream i use.</li>
      <li>At least my hands feel nice.</li>
      <li>It was easily absorbed and left my hair moisturized.</li>
      <li>It is exactly as advertised, \\&quot;light and non greasy\\&quot; and did not leave my hair tacky or stiff.</li>
      <li>This actually worked better than the carrot cream but not to the point that I&#x27;d reccomend it over luster&#x27;s pink.</li>
      <li>This product looks like it&#x27;d have the horribe &#x27;grandma&#x27;s old hair grease&#x27; smell, but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
      <li>We are currently experiencing a very mild winter in the North &amp; South East and I am curious as to how this product would maintain my hair in colder</li>
      <li>Though it left my hair shiny &amp; defined my curls, I could not handle the hardness it caused (much like I had used a styling gel of some sort).</li>
      <li>my hair is so smooooooth and soft.</li>
      <li>BUT IT MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes hair soft and supple.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been natural 10</li>
      <li>This product made my naturally curly, soft hair into a cruncy consistency.</li>
      <li>WHEN I SAY MY NATURAL HAIR CAN BE MOISTURIZED</li>
      <li>I have had other hair cream conditioners before and they have been great in giving me soft hair and a wet sleek look without the trouble of washing gel off my hands.</li>
      <li>I tried it on dry hair first and worked well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a light consistency, and a little bit really does go a long way.</li>
      <li>in my twenty two years of life, this is the first hairdress that I used completely until it was empty; it works THAT well for my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recall my hair being especially shiny, but it had normal</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a light scent and is a gross green color.</li>
      <li>because it&#x27;s super heavy and greasy.  </li>
      <li>The next morning the ends of my hair were soo soft and silky.</li>
      <li>(My hair is a little funny, so i have to use&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you have fine hair, this may be a bit too heavy for you, and I&#x27;d say you should only use it every other day, or even every two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Too much can make the hair slightly on the greaser side, in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
      <li>if you have dry, brittle, unruly natural 3/4 hair type</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my mini afro hair really soft, and really easy to comb through</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t find anything special about this product. i thought i would see a world of difference and i really didn&#x27;t. not purchasing again.</li>
    <li> OK,FIRST OF ALL IT CHEAP!!! SECOND OF ALL I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW. WHEN I SAY MY NATURAL HAIR CAN BE MOISTURIZED ONE MINUTE AND DRY THE NEXT ITS NO JOKE. I CO-WASH THEN PUT A LEAVE-IN IN AND APPLY THIS CREME, ITS LIKE  HEAVEN IN A JAR. I KNOW EVERYONE SAYS THIS BUT A LITTLE REALLY DOES GO A LONG WAY. I USE ABOUT A QUARTER SIZED AMOUNT, PALM RUB IT IN AND GO. ITS NOT ONLY MOISTURIZING BUT IT MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR NOT ONLY NATURALS BUT ANYONE LOOKIN TO GET AWAY FROM GREASE OR GREASY CREMES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ITS THE BEST BUY I&#x27;VE MADE SINCE MY BC(BIG CHOP). I KNOW YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT IF NOT THEN I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THEIR OLIVE CHOLESTEROL DEEP CONDITIONER. YES IT CONTAINS MINERAL OIL WHICH I DONT LIKE BUT ITS TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE INGREDIENTS SO ITS NOT THE BASE OF THE PRODUCT: MEANING IT DOESN&#x27;T CONTAIN ALOT.</li>
    <li> I get this and the cholesterol for $3 total from Walgreens.  I say it&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s super heavy and greasy.  I have dry hair so it&#x27;s def what I need but it&#x27;s just a bit too heavy for my hg.  But I&#x27;m always going to keep it in my arsenal for those times when my hair is really acting up.</li>
    <li> This is a recent purchase but I am pleased with the product so far. We are currently experiencing a very mild winter in the North &amp; South East and I am curious as to how this product would maintain my hair in colder temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been natural 10+ years I used this product for two strand twists (not for deep conditioning or detangling yet). It was easily absorbed and left my hair moisturized. I have also reapplied to my ends when I wear my hair in a \\&quot;twist-out\\&quot; style in between washings. It is exactly as advertised, \\&quot;light and non greasy\\&quot; and did not leave my hair tacky or stiff. Also works well on scalp if massaged in with pads of fingers. I don&#x27;t recall my hair being especially shiny, but it had normal sheen/lustre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost dismissed it due to the $3-$4 price tag but after a quick scan of the ingredients (no mineral oil or petroleum) I decided to give it a shot. I would recommend it over products i&#x27;ve purchased for twice as much. It also has a pleasant/neutral scent. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works great on my thinning hair, bought it here because drug store stopped selling it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in Walgreens for about $2 for 8 ounces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is one of the best commercial leave ins I&#x27;ve tried on coily AA hair.&lt;br /&gt;It makes hair soft and supple. Only a little is needed. Too much can make the hair slightly on the greaser side, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;It has a light scent and is a gross green color. Nothing special there.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would replace the parabens in it with a different preservative. If I continued to use this, it would be the only paraben product I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great price (if bought in stores locally) and the amount yielded makes this a definite repurchase for me. It is the only leave in I use.</li>
    <li> I have to rotate my moisturizers because things that work for me often stop working - sometimes this is due to the weather. This is one of those moisturizers that has been a constant for me.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a light non oily/greasy non-clogging the hair follicles and \\&quot;non flamable\\&quot; product that my hubby could use on his hair.  So glad I found \\&quot;Olive Creme\\&quot; it is filled with all natural ingredients that are wonderful for your hair i.e.,vitamins A,B,C, and E,Calendula, Rosemary,Sage just to name a few and it has a very light scent.  You only need to use a very small amount (talking a dime size if not smaller in the palm of your hand) apply to your scalp/hair.  It absorbs well does NOT weigh the hair down and is so natural. Since using this product his hair grows like crazy and is so soft.  I Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Kept my scalp nourished and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love this product have been using it for months and it works wonders on my hair. It so light and it has a light scent. It does weigh down my hair which is good cause some products do I use it for my oil my scalp and i can feel it working when i finish.</li>
    <li> I love it and nice smell not greasy at hot all and it works great on wet hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair either.</li>
    <li> My grand mom had a little jar of this laying around the house so when i saw it at Walgreen, i had to get it!&lt;br /&gt;As you can guess by the title, i only use this product on the ends on my hair ONLY (My hair is a little funny, so i have to use&lt;br /&gt;1 product on my scalp, and another product on my hair, and this creme product on my roots), but the ends of my hair would always&lt;br /&gt;be so very dry and brittle that every time i combed though it, chunks would fall out. (and dont even get me started on how rough it&lt;br /&gt;is after i wash and blow dry!) When i saw this laying around the house i read that it was for dry hair. I wanted to see what would happen if I put some on. So i did. The next morning the ends of my hair were soo soft and silky. I could actually comb though them and nothing would fall out!!. I L.O.V.E this stuff.! I use a small dab of this in the palm of my hand, gather my hair up, rub it into the ends and comb/brush it out. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I still have my little jar that i am still using so both the little jar and the big jar will last me for months on end! I will defiantly use more of this product in the future!&lt;br /&gt; (and espec</li>
    <li> I got my product from the Wegman&#x27;s by my house. It was my first time using this. I have had other hair cream conditioners before and they have been great in giving me soft hair and a wet sleek look without the trouble of washing gel off my hands. However this product isn&#x27;t doing it for me. I see other good reviews and this product is cheaper than the other cream i use. So I tried it, but it just seems to dry my hair out and feel hard as if its like day old gel. At least my hands feel nice.</li>
    <li> if you have dry, brittle, unruly natural 3/4 hair type then THIS is the product for you. my hair is so smooooooth and soft. it will tame your frizzy hair and flyaways!! even in the rain and humidity, my hair did not frizz up. great product and will be a staple in my regimen!! i applied the product as a leave-in on sopping wet hair then blow dried and flat iron. so glad i found this product. it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually annoyed at how well this works for my transitioning hair. I really enjoyed being a product junkie &amp; buying all of the new &amp; pricier hair products from Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Shea Moisture &amp; others.Yet,  I got this free (I&#x27;m a couponer) &amp; I&#x27;m amazed at what it does my hair especially it&#x27;s immediate tangle melting properties &amp; how it hydrates my hair like nothing else.</li>
    <li> While on vacation, sometimes it is difficult to find the products you prefer for your hair.  I happened upon this product while on vacation in Las Vegas.  It worked very well in that hot sun and made my hair shine and retained moisture.  But when I purchased it for use in NY, it did no react the same.  It continued to act as a moisturizer, but it dulled the appearance of my hair.  I guess it truly needs the hot sun to bring out its best properties.</li>
    <li> I wanted a thicker moisturizer for the winter. I wanted to try some other products but the one&#x27;s I wanted to try aren&#x27;t available in my area. I came across this while browsing in my local walgreens. I noticed that it didn&#x27;t have any mineral oil or petroleum and that it was also on sale. I tried it on dry hair first and worked well. It&#x27;s even better applied on wet hair. I give it four stars instead of five because I&#x27;s still a little iffy on the scent. It kind of smells medicated to me. My boyfriend thinks it smells like hand soap. I think it&#x27;s different for everybody. But anyway, it&#x27;s a good moisturizer :)</li>
    <li> in my twenty two years of life, this is the first hairdress that I used completely until it was empty; it works THAT well for my hair. There&#x27;s no petrolatum or mineral oil in it, so it really soaks into your hair versus just sitting on top of it. If you have fine hair, this may be a bit too heavy for you, and I&#x27;d say you should only use it every other day, or even every two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium type relaxed hair (not too thick, not too thin) and I&#x27;m able to use this every other day for about a week before I need to wash my hair. I also marveled at the smell. This product looks like it&#x27;d have the horribe &#x27;grandma&#x27;s old hair grease&#x27; smell, but it doesn&#x27;t! the scent is fairly pleasant and tolerable; you don&#x27;t smell it every time you move your head or when the wind blows like SOME products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light consistency, and a little bit really does go a long way. It&#x27;s also not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated, I was amazed by how my hair absorbed it as soon as it made contact with my hair. I&#x27;ve never had a product, especially a hairdress, do that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is unbeatable, as well. It&#x27;s usually 2-3$ in stores, which is shocking to me because of how WELL it works. Get this from a department store versus online from a sellar on amazon. You never know what you might actually be getting! Unless it&#x27;s a specialty company that specializes in beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I think you should definitely try.</li>
    <li> I bought this and the carrot cream from Hollywood beauty after watching a few youtube videos on enhancing my waves(by the way I can only speak for the folks with regular black men coarse hair). This actually worked better than the carrot cream but not to the point that I&#x27;d reccomend it over luster&#x27;s pink. This stuff has an ok smell and gives your waves that dark tent, however like I said before it dosent work so great that you should order it to replace your lusters pink which is easily found &amp; readily available unlike this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product made my naturally curly, soft hair into a cruncy consistency. Though it left my hair shiny &amp; defined my curls, I could not handle the hardness it caused (much like I had used a styling gel of some sort). Didn&#x27;t care for the oiliness either :(</li>
    <li> I started using this awhile back and it has really helped my scalp and hair feel super soft. As long as it keeps doing this I will continue to buy it. I did notice a change in just a couple days also. Good product at a reasonable price!</li>
