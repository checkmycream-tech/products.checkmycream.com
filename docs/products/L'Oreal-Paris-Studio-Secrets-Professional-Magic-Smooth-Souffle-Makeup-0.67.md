      <li>My favorite foundation; hides a multitude of sins (of course, on my face).  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Pressed powder (Physician&#x27;s formula in Translucent) has been much better for my oily skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know for sure, but it may be discontinued.  </li>
      <li>love this makeup.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff -- surprisingly -- much better than the Mac foundation</li>
      <li>I have oily, acne prone,sensitive skin and love this foundation.  </li>
      <li>great product and fast delivery</li>
      <li>love the way it goes on.  </li>
      <li>I love this foundation.  </li>
      <li>Really love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Will need to order more soon.  </li>
      <li>To top it off, it hasn&#x27;t made me breakout</li>
      <li>And very quick, I got a reply from Joe, one of the customer care?</li>
      <li>It glides on so easily with medium coverage.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is one of the few places my wife can find this stuff any more, she thinks it is great!</li>
      <li>I will never buy from them again, and I strongly encourage Amazon to review this merchant&#x27;s business ethics and contracts.</li>
      <li>It covers well and light on your skin like it&#x27;s not even there.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, makes skin look more natural, silky smooth and goes on evenly, no patches on your face.</li>
      <li>It goes on super silky and helps even skin tone.  </li>
      <li>When I previously purchased it from Walgreen&#x27;s brand new and with an intact seal, it was flawless.</li>
      <li>goes on very creamy, feels like you have nothing on your face!!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me as shiny as many, many other foundations.  </li>
      <li>but when you blend for a moment it turns the right color.  </li>
      <li>still have not receive the right item yet,</li>
      <li>I was having trouble finding this in the stores where  I used to buy it, so I was really glad to be able to order it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so incredibly smooth and soft, and feels that way on the face, too.</li>
      <li>This product is so consistent.</li>
      <li>Which, for me, is pretty much a miracle.</li>
      <li>When I read how other customers experienced the same issues, I decided to save myself the headache of attempting to return the product and do everyone else a favor and warn them away from this seller.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;nude beige\\&quot; has worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>Definitely lives up to its name - goes on smooth &amp; blends well.  </li>
      <li>It goes on so smooth, covers evenly, and most importantly, isn&#x27;t drying or uncomfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>I thought the consistency was a little strange at first, but it really, really makes your skin look nice.  </li>
      <li>It does make me shiny in the winter after about 5 hours, but then I use Maybelline shine free loose powder to take away the shine.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely high recommended to my friends &amp; everybody else.</li>
      <li>Have been using this for years, highly recommend.</li>
      <li>He apologized &amp; said will sent back the right one  for me a.s.a.p.</li>
      <li>Are they opening jars and taking out product to fill other jars so they can &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; their supply and sell them as full containers?</li>
      <li>Im not giving it a 5 star bc its a lil too soft, i should say?</li>
      <li>The products went directly into the trash.</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t offer heavy coverage, just light</li>
      <li>I gave up on foundations a long time ago because my skin is oily and very red, and eventually throughout the day, my foundation would wear off anywhere my face got hot, like my cheeks, which made me look like I had EXTRA redness because otherwise my face would still be covered by the foundation in the places I didn&#x27;t get hot, like my chin or around my ears.</li>
      <li>The only thing on my wishlist would be a formula with a high SPF but for now I will wear it under the foundation.</li>
      <li>I can see no other reason why the jars should already be opened and half-empty.</li>
      <li>When you first put it on it goes on a little darker and orange</li>
      <li>I suggest keeping the jar level for a few hours before first opening it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Really love this stuff.  Don&#x27;t know for sure, but it may be discontinued.  It covers well and light on your skin like it&#x27;s not even there.  It is very soft and fluffy and if the jar is not kept level, the makeup can shift position in the jar.  I suggest keeping the jar level for a few hours before first opening it.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m a powder girl. I gave up on foundations a long time ago because my skin is oily and very red, and eventually throughout the day, my foundation would wear off anywhere my face got hot, like my cheeks, which made me look like I had EXTRA redness because otherwise my face would still be covered by the foundation in the places I didn&#x27;t get hot, like my chin or around my ears. Ugh. Pressed powder (Physician&#x27;s formula in Translucent) has been much better for my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I tried this stuff just a few weeks ago for the first time, during the deep, humid, sweltering days of this crazy hot Nebraska summer no less, and...wow. I am in love! This product is so consistent. It doesn&#x27;t offer heavy coverage, just light I&#x27;d say, but sometimes that&#x27;s all someone might need, such as myself with very red skin. Anything with too heavy coverage leaves me looking fake, but this product covers up *just* enough of the redness to look very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it goes on.  It&#x27;s so incredibly smooth and soft, and feels that way on the face, too. I haven&#x27;t had trouble with the product \\&quot;balling up\\&quot; as some people have mentioned. It does go on lighter than it looks in the jar, so that&#x27;s something to watch out for. The \\&quot;nude beige\\&quot; has worked very well for me. It has just enough pink to keep my red face looking balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finish the foundation with the Physician&#x27;s Formula mentioned above, then the ever-amazing Skindinavia \\&quot;No More Shine\\&quot; spray, and VOILA! No red face for at least 6-8 hours. Which, for me, is pretty much a miracle.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff -- surprisingly -- much better than the Mac foundation I&#x27;ve been using for the last 5 years.</li>
    <li> Hope this product never discontinues</li>
    <li> I have oily, acne prone,sensitive skin and love this foundation.  It does make me shiny in the winter after about 5 hours, but then I use Maybelline shine free loose powder to take away the shine.  It doesn&#x27;t make me as shiny as many, many other foundations.  It goes on super silky and helps even skin tone.  When you first put it on it goes on a little darker and orange but when you blend for a moment it turns the right color.  I thought the consistency was a little strange at first, but it really, really makes your skin look nice.  To top it off, it hasn&#x27;t made me breakout and I&#x27;ve been using for over a month.  I hope this doesn&#x27;t get discontinued like others in the past.  The only thing on my wishlist would be a formula with a high SPF but for now I will wear it under the foundation.</li>
    <li> Will need to order more soon.  I can no longer find it at Walgreens.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, makes skin look more natural, silky smooth and goes on evenly, no patches on your face. Excellent</li>

    <li> I received my order on time, but unfortunately it&#x27;s was wrong item :(&lt;br /&gt;So I contact the seller by email right away to let them know that the company had sent me the wrong item, not the one that I expected.

Absolutely high recommended to my friends &amp; everybody else. Thank you for your best services.</li>
    <li> I ordered 4 of these, 3 had no seals on them and were so dried up they fell out of the jar when turned upside down. 3 jars were cracked also. When I tried to return them, I was told I had to send a picture before they would consider doing anything about it. I am never ordering from a third party again. Very disappointed in Amazon at this point. By the time I paid shipping to return them it was not worth it. Never again!</li>
    <li> great product and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding this in the stores where  I used to buy it, so I was really glad to be able to order it. It goes on so smooth, covers evenly, and most importantly, isn&#x27;t drying or uncomfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> love this makeup. awesome feeling on your face!!! goes on very creamy, feels like you have nothing on your face!!</li>
    <li> I loved this makeup when I bought it from CVS or Walgreens but they stopped selling it so I ordered it online. When I opened the jar, it looked like sand and felt even worse. There is no way I would even attempt to put it on my face. It was wrapped with a layer of saran wrap. Great product and great makeup, just not from this seller.</li>
    <li> I love this product. When I previously purchased it from Walgreen&#x27;s brand new and with an intact seal, it was flawless. I wish I had read the negative comments here before ordering from this merchant, though. I ordered two jars. When they arrived, the seals were broken and the jars looked half-full. The products went directly into the trash. I will NOT use personal items like make-up when the jars have been previously opened and dipped into. Who knows whether they&#x27;re contaminated or not? When I read how other customers experienced the same issues, I decided to save myself the headache of attempting to return the product and do everyone else a favor and warn them away from this seller. Shame on them! Are they opening jars and taking out product to fill other jars so they can &amp;#34;stretch&amp;#34; their supply and sell them as full containers? I can see no other reason why the jars should already be opened and half-empty. I will never buy from them again, and I strongly encourage Amazon to review this merchant&#x27;s business ethics and contracts.</li>
    <li> But unfortunately L&#x27;Oreal no longer makes it. I will probably die without it. I plan on buying every last one on here.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, i liked it a lot, it is easy to apply, i like a lot, i would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was so happy that I could still get this from you.  My favorite foundation; hides a multitude of sins (of course, on my face).  L&#x27;Oreal just took it out of their retail drugstore line.  But you made me happy.</li>
