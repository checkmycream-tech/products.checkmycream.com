    <li> Love jan marini product, but I noticed and my derm noticed that after using it suddenly my youthful under eye skin was popping up with  wrinkles. Be careful with this product.</li>
    <li> Exactly the same as I bought for way more at a salon.</li>
    <li> Great eye product! Love dermalogica!!</li>
    <li> I have used it for only 2 weeks but have seen an improved eye area....</li>
    <li> Not noticing a big difference. Sits on top of my skin, seems kind of oily.</li>
    <li> I am a skin product snob (I owe to my mother) but after my aestetician recommended the Jan Marini skin care line, I decided to give this eye cream a try. I love it! It smells good, it lasts a very long time and I have beatiful skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> smells amazing. Will tell you how it works.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering Age Intervention.  This cream burns when I put it on.  Not sure why?</li>
    <li> Just started using this product so far so good!</li>
    <li> Great eye cream!  Is not greasy around my eyes like some cream are</li>
    <li> my best eye cream ever</li>
    <li> I use Jan Marini line for several years . I&#x27;m very happy with creams, masks, lotions they offer. I used to have an acne problem, and my cosmetologist suggested this line for me. It works perfectly well on my skin. I do not have a severe acne issues anymore, and my skin feels fine</li>
    <li> Good price for this product on amazon compared to other sites. Cream goes on silky smooth, not greasy and has a nice light fragrance. I am very allergic to face products, especially around my eyes but no problem with this. I see results after one month&#x27;s use.  Update: Jan Marini website lists Amazon (all vendors) as an unauthorized seller.mthis may be a counterfeit product. Beware.</li>
    <li> Love JM products.  Decided to purchase the eye cream since all of the other products worked great.  THIS ONE CAUSES MORE WRINKLES!!!  Unless you want to look older, do not use this!!!</li>
    <li> It is too early to give a definitive review.  For now -  I like the cream, it is very light, good for sensitive eyes, and seems to be smoothing out eye area skin.</li>
    <li> works great for extra moisture under eyes</li>
    <li> This is the first time using this product, so wanted to give it a few weeks before writing a review. I can definitely see results, the fine lines around my eyes are starting to diminish and the skin feels more hydrated. I would highly recommend this product, but give it a few weeks to see results.</li>
    <li> BEST EYE CREAM EVER!!&lt;br /&gt;Jan Marini Transformation Eye Cream has been on my &amp;#34;Can&#x27;t Live Without&amp;#34; list for years! I recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Jani Marini has great products.</li>
    <li> very good and clears the bags and dark circles from under the eyes.</li>
    <li> Great product, have used for years I am 60 yrs old and my skin is amazing, at least thst is what my dermatologist says.</li>
    <li> this Transformation eye cream is so wonderful , it quickly absorbs , reduces fine lines , and deeper lines are plumped up also , it is mat finish , but the moisture is in your skin , you can feel it and see it is holding in suppleness and moisture . I am putting it on chemically damaged skin (gurr) , and it actually healing some 2 year old damage , the emu oil quit doing its thing , so I went back to Jan Marini eye cream , and wow , glad I did.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products that I buy that is not organic. It works so well I can&#x27;t find anything else like it. I have very sensitive eye areas and this is not too heavy but enough to keep my eye area hydrated and smooth....a hard thing to find!</li>
    <li> Know her, use her products, love her ethics. A label that you can trust and that gives results in a very short time!</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping! I love this product. I have tried many eye creams but I am going back to Jan Martini and never changing again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, however, the print on the outside of the jar rubbed off.  Makes me wonder one of two things: 1)what is in this jar? 2)was this a knockoff with a bad print job on the jar</li>
    <li> This eye cream is good for me ,i love it,the price is cheaper than my city,so,this  eye cream worth to buy</li>
    <li> All JM products are almost professional grade. As long as you continue to use them, they make a visible difference in the quality of your skin. A little expensive , but worth it. Wish I could get all my friends to use JM</li>
