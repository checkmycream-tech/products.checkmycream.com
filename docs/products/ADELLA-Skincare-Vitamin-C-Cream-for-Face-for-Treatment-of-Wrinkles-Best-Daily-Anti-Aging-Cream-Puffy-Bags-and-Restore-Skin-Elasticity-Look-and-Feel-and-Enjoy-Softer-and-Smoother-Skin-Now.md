    <li> Item arrived as describe with fast delivery. The cream works well so far. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It soaks into your skin and moisturize very well.</li>
    <li> Wow what a great vitamin c cream! I have done my research on wrinkle and everyday creams,and anything with natural vitamin c seems to be the best for your skin. This vitamin c cream I have actually using on my neck and chest,and it has left my skin extremely soft and smooth. It also has a light fresh scent. I wish it would come in a bigger jar</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin, not sticky or greasy. I have not used it long enough to review the benefits so I will review again in the future. The container was a bit scratched up and dirty which made it look cheap. But overall, this is a great cream. I received a discount for buying one of their other products.</li>
    <li> Goes on silky smooth, no sticky feeling. I am pleased with the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far.</li>
    <li> I am loving this vitamin c cream. Keeps my skin soft and nourished. Helps diminish my fine wrinkes. I absolutely love it</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife to try out in exchange for a review. She was very happy with the size of the bottle because it fits in her purse or pocket for easy travel. The price was great too seeing how we got it in exchange for a review. We have a toddler so my wife is often up a lot at night and up super early in the morning with our twelve year to get him off to school so she has bags under her eyes. I had her try this and she looks so much less tired and beat down. I&#x27;m probably going to have to buy more.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned about using this product because I have very sensitive skin.  The cream is thin (it feels kinda watery) and goes on easily and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  It leaves the skin with a soft, silky feel.  The first thing I noticed shortly after putting it on is that my face would feel tighter.  I&#x27;ve used it consistently over the past couple of months and I still feel my skin tighten. I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Very nice, super moisturizing cream. I have found that it helps to make the dry areas of my face smoother and more hydrated. I really like this cream.</li>
    <li> Keep this handy in the car when dryness hits me. I use it all over, wherever I feel dryness. Great product !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for only a little over 2 weeks but I can already tell the difference. I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles... I was not expecting my wrinkles to disappear but I must say that my face looks better, less dry... Wrinkles got slightly reduced. My face looks definitely healthier and more elastic. I&#x27;m very very pleased with this cream. I will surely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I really love how well this moisturizes my face. It isn&#x27;t overly greasy like most face creams i&#x27;ve tried and has a very pleasant smell .  i RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for all skin types My skin tends to get dry and flaky in the winter months and oily in the summer. I am always on the lookout for a year-round cream The jar is small in size. I like the smell of this face Cream. I used it twice a day. I first cleanse my face, then I apply serum, followed by this Face Cream. It keep my skin moisturized and hydrated. ..I always have dry flaking skin...not anymore I use one time a day and my skin is soft and supple and radiant...it has a very light fragrant scent that is nice on the nose.</li>
    <li> This cream is refreshing and lighr. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great cream. Silky face. My face feels softer since I started using.</li>
    <li> Love this product really helps with puffy eyes, and no breaks outs from using this cream!</li>
    <li> I have bought and used several products from Adella and this by far is my favorite. This vitamin C cream makes my skin so soft on my face. I was worried that this cream would dry my skin out because it should normally be used with a moisturizer, but it didn&#x27;t. I ran out of my regular moisturizer and kept on using this vitamin c cream by itself, and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out but instead made it feel more supple and soft. I used to get red blotches on my face usually on my cheeks and chin area and since I have been using this cream those have vanished. I also don&#x27;t have as many blackheads as I used to get. This cream is lightweight and not heavy and therefore it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like some other products have done in the past. My eczema that was on my face before using this product is now gone. This cream has made my face look flawless without bumps, redness, puffiness, and pimples. I am very sensitive to creams, and many on the market make me break out or have an allergic reaction but not this vitamin c cream, it doesn&#x27;t make me feel irritated like other products that I have used. I highly recommend this vitamin c cream to anyone looking for a good cream to use on their face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now, and I really like it. It moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel and it&#x27;s helped to reduce the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Good product, fast shipping. Crossing my fingers for results.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. not only does it make your face fell and look great, if you have dry hands and feet it works on them as well. i have learned this stuff works on any part of your body really. it makes your skin soft without making it oily or greasy. i love this and will be buying it again. 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice cream! A little goes a long way; it doesn&#x27;t clog pores and smells great!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly in bundle with dermaroller and vit c serum.  Product is light, silky, fragragrance free, and very soothing after dermarolling.  It is prefect for my combination skin which is prone to and mildly scarred by cystic acne. I&#x27;ll stick with it and look for improvement.</li>
    <li> Love it! I want more!</li>
    <li> Love all the components of this cream.  I have only used it a couple of times, but I can already tell a difference.  My face is smoother!</li>
    <li> Awesome vitamin c face cream! I have horrible trouble with dry skin attributed to eczema. I have combination skin, but tend to lean more towards dry than oily, with the oily only being in my T-zone.. I was hoping this would help with my dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love products that contain vitamin c, so of course I was expecting to love this face cream! It turns out that I actually DO. It goes on smooth, and absorbs very quickly without leaving my face greasy or sticky. It feels REALLY good on, and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant softening to the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#x27;t caused me any irritation as a result of use, and I really like vitamin c in the summer time. Vitamin C products are FANTASTIC for sun damage, so this cream is going to be my go to cream for after sun care. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality and effectiveness, and I would absolutely buy again. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> Perfect for my winter blues.&lt;br /&gt;My skin always tends to become dry and stretchy during the winters. Moreover I have sensitive skin so I avoid using any product as I get really paranoid. But this worked wonders from the word go. It has Vitamic C and Shea Butter (which is one of most favorite ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;It does all that it claims and even more.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels so much more softer by using this. And the stretchy feeling is gone. This cream is not at all greasy. It gets absorbed easily hence does not leave you feeling uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I also have little redness around my cheekbone which has become visibly lesser since I have started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Adella skincare&#x27;s products my daily routine consists of using the facial cleansing system and then applying this face cream.&lt;br /&gt;I do not need to go to a salon for facial anymore. Its all covered right at the convenience of my home.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by- Shazia</li>
    <li> This feels great on my face. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I loved the creaminess of the product, but it&#x27;s not thick. I love that it does not smell like any chemical, this is important to me because I need to use moisturizer all the time and sometimes, if I exercise at night, some moisturizers can let out a chemical that irritates my eyes, this cream seems to be very natural. Also, I received a coupon to order it, so it makes the experience even sweeter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product in impecable condition.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cream.  It is light and airy and did not affect my sensitive skin.  My face feels softer and more youthful.</li>
    <li> My skin tends to get dry and flaky in the winter months and oily in the summer.  I am always on the lookout for a year-round cream so I  jumped at the chance to receive this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  It has a light texture, yet it is very hydrating.  It sinks into my skin and does not feel greasy and sit on top.  I have been using this cream for about two weeks.  I have noticed that the dry, patchy areas on my forehead and around my nose have disappeared.  My crows feet around my eyes are also less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently started using a derma roller on my skin and I have found this to be a great product to use on my skin after rolling due to its natural ingredients including shea butter.  It is nonirritating and leaves my face feeling baby soft.  A little bit goes a long way.  I love the way my face feels!</li>
    <li> My cream arrived yesterday I put it on before work (3rd shift) my face feels softer and looks brighter maybe its just  wishful thinking. This cream is very light weight and is a wonderful moisturizer. So far so good! I&#x27;ll let you know how it&#x27;s coming along in a week or so. Still using this great cream, my skin is softer and brighter love it!</li>
    <li> I love this cream! A structure is light, and my skin feels fresh and toned. I use it once or twice a day alone on with a make-up. It just feels good after I use it.</li>
    <li> This facial cream is just in time for my dry and chapped face from the brutal winter. This facial cream has Shea butter in it which is the best for your skin when dry n chapped because it doesn&#x27;t hurt to apply. This cream absorbs fast so it makes it easy to apply before putting on your make-up. It also has no greasy feeling and is very light weight on your face. I recieved the facial cream at a discount during a promotion for my honest unbiased review. I am really enjoying using this facial cream and looking forward to seeing the benefits from it.</li>
