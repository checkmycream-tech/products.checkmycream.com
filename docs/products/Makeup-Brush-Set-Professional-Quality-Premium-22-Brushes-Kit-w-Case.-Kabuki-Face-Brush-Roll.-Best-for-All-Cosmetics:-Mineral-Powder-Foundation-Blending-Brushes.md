      <li>These brushes are made nicely.</li>

      <li>I am glad to see so many varieties included-as there is a tool for every application</li>
      <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>and I love.</li>
      <li>They are soft, they apply makeup smoothly, and they are beautiful!</li>
      <li>but this one has more brush types.</li>
      <li>set comes in a travel bag which opens up nicely to display all your brushes (see my attached pic), and then closes securely in a purse-like form to easily carry around.</li>
      <li>The quality of the brushes are pretty good.</li>
      <li>I was a little worried but these brushes came in a nice leather case and the brushes were supper great quality!!</li>
      <li>tried the foundation brush right away and was very pleased with how well my foundation spread across my face without dragging.</li>
      <li>I am a huge makeup fan and love to take care of my brushes.  </li>
      <li>you are a makeup addict like I am, then you&#x27;ll understand why I am so excited that this set actually includes a REALLY nice foundation brush along with all the others!!</li>
      <li>These will be great as a starter set for someone just starting out with experimenting with makeup.</li>
      <li>The brush handles are sturdy yet they are still light weight.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I think it is worth checking out Coastal Scents brush set beforepurchasing this as I think it is a better value for your money.</li>
      <li>I purchased these brushes based on the very positive reviews and that they were recommended by many beauty gurus on youtube.</li>
      <li>You can not beat the high end quality for a more than affordable price!</li>
      <li>They are definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Coastal scents brush set has many more natural hair brushes and they are all listed in the description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>This is a good set, especially for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
      <li>The case is cool with a magnetic closure.  </li>
      <li>There are definitely more pieces than you normally see in a set</li>
      <li>Overall I have been very pleased with this set.</li>
      <li>Also they all wrap back up into a super cute leather clutch!</li>
      <li>There is a brush for anything you could possibly need and the price is amazing.</li>
      <li>So far I love these brushes.</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft and I love the design of the handles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The brushes are nice quality, and there is every size you could possibly want.</li>
      <li>and I am nothing short of thrilled.</li>
      <li>, long full sized handles for easy and ergonomically correct application.&lt;br /&gt;All came nicely and individually packaged.&lt;br</li>
      <li>have pretty much all the different types of brushes you would need here to create a nice look.</li>
      <li>I also have been looking for a more complete set to replace some of my older brushes.  </li>
      <li>Having said that I don&#x27;t really think these brushes are worth $50 when compared to Coastal scents brushes for $35</li>
      <li>Very affordable quality brushes!</li>
      <li>The case itself kinda smelled when I first got it</li>
      <li>The other brushes are very soft and pleasant to feel against your skin, and do their job</li>
      <li>and you certainly can&#x27;t beat this price for the quality.</li>
      <li>The black and red of the brush set is also attractive.</li>
      <li>And the case is very high quality.</li>
      <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t travel much</li>
      <li>a real BOUNTY of brushes for all us makeup</li>
      <li>case is a nice, stiff pleather</li>
      <li>I love these brushes the are soft not as hard as the ones i have, easy to handle</li>
      <li>The bristles are soft yet firm enough for great makeup application.</li>
      <li>I have been waiting a long time to have a FULL makeup brush set, and FINALLY got to try out this huge set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Every time I look for a brush set, they NEVER have a foundation brush included, and I would have to buy one separately for a high price.</li>
      <li>Each brush has its own individual slot and there is a leather peace that goes over the brushes so you are not making a mess.  </li>
      <li>The quality of the handles are solid and the pouch is pretty decent.</li>
      <li>The bristles are very soft and do not fall out.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>These brushes are so soft!</li>
      <li>however the face brushes and especially the large fan brush had a decent amount of shedding that surprised me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The synthetic brushes (most of this set) are very stiff feeling when applying makeup, They pick up makeup well</li>
      <li>however the red sewing looks very cheap and tacky and in a few places is coming undone on my case</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was a little worried but these brushes came in a nice leather case and the brushes were supper great quality!! And the case is very high quality.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes the are soft not as hard as the ones i have, easy to handle</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes based on the very positive reviews and that they were recommended by many beauty gurus on youtube. Having had them for a little while they remind me very much of my [[ASIN:B005UBN5AQ Coastal Scents 22 Piece Brush Set]] which I&#x27;ve had for a couple years now and I love. Having said that I don&#x27;t really think these brushes are worth $50 when compared to Coastal scents brushes for $35 but I will go over the pros and cons to see if these brushes are for you.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice metal ferrule and wood handles. The black and red of the brush set is also attractive. The wood handles are pouras to the touch, not sleek just to be noted.&lt;br /&gt;You have pretty much all the different types of brushes you would need here to create a nice look. This is a good set, especially for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;Nice, long full sized handles for easy and ergonomically correct application.&lt;br /&gt;All came nicely and individually packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The case is a nice, stiff pleather however the red sewing looks very cheap and tacky and in a few places is coming undone on my case so I was a bit disappointed here.&lt;br /&gt;The vast majority of these brushes are synthetic with about 3 goat hair brushes and 1 pony hair eye brush. At this price I would have liked more natural hair brushes, especially more in the eye brushes. Coastal scents brush set has many more natural hair brushes and they are all listed in the description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;When I first washed these brushes a few hairs came out here and there on some of them (no big deal) however the face brushes and especially the large fan brush had a decent amount of shedding that surprised me. There has been no shedding when using the brushes however.&lt;br /&gt;The synthetic brushes (most of this set) are very stiff feeling when applying makeup, They pick up makeup well but you apply a fair amount of pressure to apply the makeup to your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it is worth checking out Coastal Scents brush set beforepurchasing this as I think it is a better value for your money.</li>
    <li> A good selection of brushes and a great starter set.</li>
    <li> The bristles are a bit coarse compared to other well known brands. The quality of the handles are solid and the pouch is pretty decent.</li>
    <li> Cutest case ever! Very good quality and I love the design of the case and the brushes! Great buy!</li>
    <li> awesome awesome brushes!!!! I love that the strands do NOT fall out when I am using them! HUGE PLUS FOR ME!</li>
    <li> these brushes are amazing. There is a brush for anything you could possibly need and the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moI1N5YEGSUYFP]]These makeup brushes are ON PONIT! You can not beat the high end quality for a more than affordable price! They are seriously Pro Quality brushes for the price of what you would pay for a beginners set! A must have for anyone of any age who loves makeup! Every brush you could possibly need is included.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Lovely case! Will tell my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on  time and was everything I expected</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are soft, they apply makeup smoothly, and they are beautiful! I am the envy of my friends when they see this kit! I love the convenient and luxurious case they come in! I am in love with these brushes and am so glad I purchased them! They are definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  These brushes are a great value and very well made!  Perfect brushes for what I needed!</li>
    <li> So far I love these brushes. They work great.</li>
    <li> Would have loved labels for what each brush should be used for.</li>
    <li> Great brushes wash up nice.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft! There is so many of them, you have a brush for anything you would need! This collection should definitely be included in every girls makeup collection! Good quality!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome set of makeup brushes. I own another set but this one has more brush types. There are very small striping type brushes for lining eyes, a spoolie brush, shadow and powder brushes, and a fan brush. This set has a brush size and type for basically any thing you need. The brush handles are sturdy yet they are still light weight. The bristles are soft yet firm enough for great makeup application. It comes in a flip open style case that is black with red accents (which match the brushes). Overall I have been very pleased with this set. It would make a great addition to any makeup lovers set and also would be a great gift.</li>
    <li> Excellent value. I purchased a few of these as gifts and I am nothing short of thrilled. There are definitely more pieces than you normally see in a set and you certainly can&#x27;t beat this price for the quality. The case is excellent and these will no doubt be a hit at our holiday exchange. I decided to keep one set for myself, and they work well and wash up quite nicely. With care, they will last a while and were a perfect addition to my beauty routine. I am glad to see so many varieties included-as there is a tool for every application and I just love playing around with them! I can&#x27;t wait to give away the others to my sisters and see their reactions!</li>
    <li> Wow! I am totally in love!  I am a huge makeup fan and love to take care of my brushes.  I also have been looking for a more complete set to replace some of my older brushes.  This set truly did not disappoint. This set  comes with every brush you would need for foundation, blush, eye, and lips.  The brushes are great quality.  The bristles are very soft and do not fall out. These brushes feel like silk on my face. This set will last me years! Also I love the case that these come in.  Each brush has its own individual slot and there is a leather peace that goes over the brushes so you are not making a mess.  Also they all wrap back up into a super cute leather clutch! I can&#x27;t wait to show off these brushes, and will likely get a set for friends as a gift.  Very affordable quality brushes!</li>
    <li> In love with these brushes! I use them everyday. They are so soft and work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice brush set. The brushes are soft and will probably last awhile. I got an awesome deal on these. I plan on giving these as a gift.</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes are pretty good. However a lot of the small brushes are the same. Also the set doesn&#x27;t come with any fluffy shadow eyeshadow brushes.</li>
    <li> I have been waiting a long time to have a FULL makeup brush set, and FINALLY got to try out this huge set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a makeup addict like I am, then you&#x27;ll understand why I am so excited that this set actually includes a REALLY nice foundation brush along with all the others!! Every time I look for a brush set, they NEVER have a foundation brush included, and I would have to buy one separately for a high price. So right off the bat, happy about this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes in a travel bag which opens up nicely to display all your brushes (see my attached pic), and then closes securely in a purse-like form to easily carry around. (see additional photo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are nice quality, and there is every size you could possibly want. There are even two brushes for eyelashes and brows included...a real BOUNTY of brushes for all us makeup lovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the foundation brush right away and was very pleased with how well my foundation spread across my face without dragging. The other brushes are very soft and pleasant to feel against your skin, and do their job well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would make an excellent gift that would make any girl happy to have in her arsenal.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  They&#x27;re soft and have held up to washing without bristles falling out.  The case is cool with a magnetic closure.  The case itself kinda smelled when I first got it but it has aired out and didn&#x27;t effect the brushes.  Plus, I don&#x27;t travel much so I doubt I&#x27;ll need the case anyway.  But, it&#x27;s nice to have</li>
    <li> Great brushes! I ha. A few of the hairs fall out, but nothing out of the norm. Haven&#x27;t figured out what to do with most of them, but I&#x27;ll figure it out!</li>
    <li> Great variety. Soft. I love them.</li>
    <li> These brushes are made nicely. The bristles are soft and I love the design of the handles. There are lots of different uses for these brushes.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. These will be great as a starter set for someone just starting out with experimenting with makeup.</li>
