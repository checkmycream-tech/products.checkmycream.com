      <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this Illuminator!</li>
      <li>And I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Has a nice shimmer to it.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t blend as nicely</li>
      <li>I own both.</li>
      <li>Half-and-half with moisturizer on the legs looks nice.</li>
      <li>kind of stains the skin as well.</li>
      <li>It gave a really nice sunkissed glow, which is what I was hoping for....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving this illuminator.</li>
      <li>For the money, this is a nice illuminator.</li>
      <li>The nars is more money</li>
      <li>it really does the job, making you look great?</li>
      <li>In compare, this product was more glittery</li>
      <li>It went on smooth and applied nicely when worn UNDER foundation.</li>
      <li>Love this liquid illuminator.  </li>
      <li>Because of this, this highlighter looks more like a shimmery blush on my face.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll like it better in the summer when I have more tan.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have light skin that fits between warm and olive tones.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>That said it works pretty well with good pigment.</li>
      <li>but it gaves a natural dewy skin finish which is great for every day</li>
      <li>It applies well and easily and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
      <li>Its a great price, actually cheaper here on Amazon (where I got mine) than at Target where I saw it.</li>
      <li>Btw you should try JM argan oil light...</li>
      <li>so I get the best of both - full coverage from the foundation with a slight glow from the Illuminator.</li>
      <li>I mix it with a bright pink liquid blush and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>This product combined with my foundation gives me perfect coverage and that soft, dewy look of younger skin.</li>
      <li>The product is much darker than I thought and behaves more like those suntan make-ups.  </li>
      <li>Great price, great quality, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>This gives.you a really amazing glow that looks radiant and natural if you use it right.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.  </li>
      <li>Great as a highlight for medium and dark skin.</li>
      <li>Just the right glow.</li>
      <li>Hope u enjoy this product as much as I do, it has many different uses!</li>
      <li>also once its on the skin it dries and isn&#x27;t very easy to move if you wait to long to blend.i</li>
      <li>but may have to go back to my favorite illuminator, NARS.</li>
      <li>its unlike any other oil and is not.greasy, doesnt make your skin oily even if u have oily skin, and does wonders for your skin that can.be.used in so many ways!</li>
      <li>Needless to say I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Great dupe for the more expensive Benefit High Beam.</li>
      <li>Since my skin is darker, I can get away with a little bit more, but it blends so well!</li>
      <li>Thus product really works it wonht break you out or dry out skin one of my favorite products</li>
      <li>and I use this underneath my more matte foundations because I have dry skin!</li>
      <li>Very blendable.</li>
      <li>I really dont like to wear foundation every day.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use it as much</li>
      <li>will give 3 stars for this product because of the prompt and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This cannot be the real NYX ILLUMINATOR.THE REAL ONE</li>
      <li>Born to Glow &amp; mix in my palm with my finger and apply to my entire face lightly...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I expected this product to be a bit more noticeable, once I applied the product I had to ad quite a bit more to make it even remotely visible.</li>
      <li>Most illuminator a are considerably more expensive.</li>
      <li>I...will like to ask if anyone look and theirs from a Amazon and compare from NYX main site ..</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It was a little more tan hue than I was hoping.</li>
      <li>I like it and it is easy to put on and blend with other foundations.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok for a quick touch of color in a casual setting.</li>
      <li>I use this to mix in with my foundation when i want a natural glow all over.</li>
      <li>Not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>As soon as I finish the foundation application, I put a bit of this on my nose and upper check area, and it gives a really youthful look.</li>
      <li>It makes your foundation.stay longer with a more subtle glow.</li>
      <li>the BOLD WRITING IS IN English only forgetting the Spanish...</li>
      <li>You will get a little glow so its not bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this to mix in with my foundation when i want a natural glow all over. It works well for that</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use a matte foundation for the coverage, but donlt like the old-lady look that you get with matte finishes. As soon as I finish the foundation application, I put a bit of this on my nose and upper check area, and it gives a really youthful look. I&#x27;m ad advocate for this.</li>
    <li> The product is much darker than I thought and behaves more like those suntan make-ups.  I am fair complecgted.</li>
    <li> I love this it really does the job, making you look great?</li>
    <li> Thus product really works it wonht break you out or dry out skin one of my favorite products</li>
    <li> Very pretty.  Gives a slight shimmer to your skin which is what I was looking for.  I use it as a blush as well as bronzer.</li>
    <li> A little too orange/red for my skin...kind of stains the skin as well.</li>
    <li> I like this okay but may have to go back to my favorite illuminator, NARS. This doesn&#x27;t blend as nicely but it&#x27;s ok for a quick touch of color in a casual setting.</li>
    <li> This was at a great buy. It is a good highlighter for all skin tones. Has a nice shimmer to it.</li>
    <li> I usually use a much more expensive brand. But thought I would try this out! This stuff was AMAZING! I am IMPRESSED! Was not expecting these results due to price. So girls dump the expensive stuff that starts with a P, and get this from on! I am!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t plan full-bore on face before makeup. It&#x27;ll look like you scraped eyeshadow onto your dry skin. Half-and-half with moisturizer on the legs looks nice.</li>
    <li> Great dupe for the more expensive Benefit High Beam. In compare, this product was more glittery but there&#x27;s no complaints. It went on smooth and applied nicely when worn UNDER foundation. I tried applying it over and it didn&#x27;t work well (looked splotchy). I use a medium coverage foundation, so it was visible. Not sure how it would do under heavy coverage.</li>
    <li> I expected this product to be a bit more noticeable, once I applied the product I had to ad quite a bit more to make it even remotely visible. I don&#x27;t think ill be buying this product again once it runs out. also once its on the skin it dries and isn&#x27;t very easy to move if you wait to long to blend.i will give 3 stars for this product because of the prompt and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Illuminator! I mix a very small amount onto a damp sponge with my foundation so I get the best of both - full coverage from the foundation with a slight glow from the Illuminator. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this illuminator. I use it to add some glow to my cheekbones, I was a little worried that maybe it would burn or feel sticky being that I was putting it on my face but I have had no problems. Its a great price, actually cheaper here on Amazon (where I got mine) than at Target where I saw it.</li>
    <li> Nyx Glow illuminator&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see a difference once i applied the applicator maybe I&#x27;m using it incorrectly or need other products to go with it.. I&#x27;ve tried in every way to see results and havent..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;any suggestions</li>
    <li> This is great. I have light skin that fits between warm and olive tones. Because of this, this highlighter looks more like a shimmery blush on my face. Still love it though and it does look great. Great as a highlight for medium and dark skin. It applies well and easily and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I bought this on the NYX website and I got it today. I am a MAC NC50 (dark skinned, perhaps like Gabrielle Union) and I use this underneath my more matte foundations because I have dry skin! And I love this stuff! Since my skin is darker, I can get away with a little bit more, but it blends so well! I wouldn&#x27;t call this a highlight but it gaves a natural dewy skin finish which is great for every day use if you have dry skin like me! You can also mix this with your moisturizer if you don&#x27;t feel like wearing a foundation. Amazing product!</li>
    <li> This cannot be the real NYX ILLUMINATOR.THE REAL ONE IS 0.5fl.oz this crap is 0.6fl oz the writing is all different..the BOLD WRITING IS IN English only forgetting the Spanish... ...please aware if I&#x27;m wrong the real illuminator has three line across in English and four lines across in Spanish describing the product..check yours from Amazon and compare...I...will like to ask if anyone look and theirs from a Amazon and compare from NYX main site ..thanx...</li>
    <li> This bottle is small and came practically empty. That said it works pretty well with good pigment. The nars is more money but you get triple the product. I own both. They work similarly.</li>
    <li> This gives.you a really amazing glow that looks radiant and natural if you use it right. My skin is different shades of tan depending on season.(American Indian) in the winter my tan fades and my face tends to look really dull in color and washed out. I really dont like to wear foundation every day. In the summer I like to put on a little eye liner, mascara and some gloss because my tan kinda hides flaws so I usually dont wear foundation. I was looking for something to lighten up my face and thought I would try this because it&#x27;s so inexpensive. So heres the secret...put a pea sized amount in your palm and mix it with your mousturizer or lotion so the color will spread out and glow instead of look glittery. It looks so good u can wear alone or over foundation for highlighting/contouring. My secret concoction is adding a couple of drops of Josie Maran argan oil light to a pea size amount of.Born to Glow &amp; mix in my palm with my finger and apply to my entire face lightly...it looks amazing! Btw you should try JM argan oil light...its unlike any other oil and is not.greasy, doesnt make your skin oily even if u have oily skin, and does wonders for your skin that can.be.used in so many ways! Mix Born to Glow with something and it looks amazing! Update: if worn alone ot doesnt last all day, but I do touch my face often. However when.I wear over foundation as a highlighte it looks really good. Still mix with lotion, just use less lotion apply to areas needing illumination or mix with foundation for all over glow. I have used it as  a primer under my foundation also(let dry between products) It makes your foundation.stay longer with a more subtle glow. Hope u enjoy this product as much as I do, it has many different uses!</li>
    <li> DID NOT ENHANCE GREATLY</li>
    <li> It gave a really nice sunkissed glow, which is what I was hoping for....Needless to say I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this liquid illuminator.  Apply with moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a product that would give me that dewy look I had when I was younger. I finally found it! This product combined with my foundation gives me perfect coverage and that soft, dewy look of younger skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> For the money, this is a nice illuminator. I use it over my foundation to brighten up my sallow complexion. Most illuminator a are considerably more expensive.</li>
    <li> Just the right glow. This little tube exceeded my expectations. Great price, great quality, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It is a little hard to blend so I don&#x27;t use it as much but it is beautiful. Great addition to my collection.</li>
    <li> Great consistency, love the color. Very blendable. If you&#x27;re pale this may have too much bronzer in it.</li>
    <li> I have worn similar products which have a richer base, but this seems fine.</li>
    <li> I like it and it is easy to put on and blend with other foundations.  You will get a little glow so its not bad.</li>
    <li> Never found the Liquid Illuminator  before in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Really Happy that I found it on amazon !&lt;br /&gt;I mix it in with my foundation, and  it looks  GOOD !</li>
    <li> I like this. It was a little more tan hue than I was hoping. I mix it with a bright pink liquid blush and it&#x27;s ok. Maybe I&#x27;ll like it better in the summer when I have more tan.</li>
    <li> Love it! Not heavy at all. Gives me a beautiful glow :)</li>
