      <li>great taste, good for frying</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Product arrived in a timely manner, beautifully packaged and fresh.</li>
      <li>Also, just by the appearance of the bottle and labeling, it does not look like a food grade oil, but more of something you would use in your bathtub.  </li>
      <li>I will order more, I wish it came in a 32 oz.</li>
      <li>Adorable Inc.  is not macademia nut oil.  </li>
      <li>so many wrinkles</li>
      <li>I also love the smell.</li>
      <li>This looks more like refined oil and tastes like nothing at all.</li>
      <li>Much better than cooking with canola or vegetable oil.</li>
      <li>Great product quick shipping thanks</li>
      <li>Have used it up very quickly-</li>
      <li>What was sent to me is too light in color, and does not smell like Macadamia nut  oil.</li>
      <li>and I really like Dr. Adorable&#x27;s brand.  </li>
      <li>I have yet to do a test taste, but I would have preferred a more professional looking box and a glass bottle.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this Macadamia Nut Oil along with Dr Adorable&#x27;s Meadowfoam seed oil and they look, smell, and taste exactly the same.</li>
      <li>My skin loves it and stays hydrated and smooth far longer than with lotions and creams.</li>
      <li>I decided to use it because returning it was too much hassle.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>It sure helps my skin to have the appearance of less wrinkles, and the price is not too high either!</li>
      <li>Mainly water bout 4 tablespoons of oil</li>
      <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy a bottle like that from the store, so I&#x27;m not sure why the seller thought it appropriate to send it out thaat way.</li>
      <li>And love that it has absolutely no smell which my last one did.</li>
      <li>Ladies, I recommend this instead of those expensive face and eye creams, and it feels good to know it is all natural!</li>
      <li>I was a bit surprised on how it was packaged.  </li>
      <li>It was wrapped in a US postal plasic bag, within another US postal bag, and the inner bag was very oily, as the plastic bottle had leaked.  </li>
      <li>Not only have I used this product in baking but also directly on my skin.  </li>

<li> No strong smell.  </li>
<li> Menopause dried up my skin, and my usual lotions didn&#x27;t work anymore...</li>
<li> cold pressed</li>

    <li> I have been using macademia nut oil for years. The oil I received from Dr.. Adorable Inc.  is not macademia nut oil.  What was sent to me is too light in color, and does not smell like Macadamia nut  oil. It also has a lighter texture.  I decided to use it because returning it was too much hassle.  I will not buy from this merchant again.</li>
    <li> Great source for Omega 3&#x27;s. Much better than cooking with canola or vegetable oil.</li>
    <li> Great product quick shipping thanks</li>
    <li> great oil for skin and hair</li>
    <li> Next time I will probably try a different brand, this is not very nutty or buttery as I have seen described for mac nut oil.</li>
    <li> Love it! And love that it has absolutely no smell which my last one did. I will order more, I wish it came in a 32 oz. bottle.</li>
    <li> Menopause dried up my skin, and my usual lotions didn&#x27;t work anymore...yikes...so many wrinkles I just had to do something. Well that something is Macadamia Oil...cold pressed and I really like Dr. Adorable&#x27;s brand.  It sure helps my skin to have the appearance of less wrinkles, and the price is not too high either! Ladies, I recommend this instead of those expensive face and eye creams, and it feels good to know it is all natural!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Macadamia Nut Oil along with Dr Adorable&#x27;s Meadowfoam seed oil and they look, smell, and taste exactly the same. I&#x27;m not convinced either is what they have been described to be. From what I&#x27;ve read from other sources, cold pressed Macadamia Nut Oil should be golden yellow and have a nutty smell and flavor. This looks more like refined oil and tastes like nothing at all. There is also no proper labeling to assure that the product is organic as advertised and both bottles came with a slick coating of oil. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy a bottle like that from the store, so I&#x27;m not sure why the seller thought it appropriate to send it out thaat way.</li>
    <li> great taste, good for frying</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is macademia Nut Oil.  It has no flavor at all.</li>
    <li> Just received the package today.  I was a bit surprised on how it was packaged.  It was wrapped in a US postal plasic bag, within another US postal bag, and the inner bag was very oily, as the plastic bottle had leaked.  Upon opening at my Ups store, I was covered in oil.  I have seen a similar review previously.  I have yet to do a test taste, but I would have preferred a more professional looking box and a glass bottle.  Also, just by the appearance of the bottle and labeling, it does not look like a food grade oil, but more of something you would use in your bathtub.  I feel like I need further confirmation before consumption.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Tastes great!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner, beautifully packaged and fresh. Have used it up very quickly- will order two bottles this time!</li>
    <li> Goes on as a very thin coat which quickly dries.  No strong smell.  Very nice for home made lotions and/or soaps.</li>
    <li> Not only have I used this product in baking but also directly on my skin.  My skin loves it and stays hydrated and smooth far longer than with lotions and creams.</li>
    <li> This is a great oil, it helps with hair growth and moisturization for my locs. I also love the smell. I create a mixture of the oil and water in a spray bottle and spray my locs before I leave the house in the morning to keep it moisturized. Mainly water bout 4 tablespoons of oil, you will have to shake it up to get some type of mixture. The water will run out before the oil, so just refill it with water until the oil needs to be replenished.</li>
