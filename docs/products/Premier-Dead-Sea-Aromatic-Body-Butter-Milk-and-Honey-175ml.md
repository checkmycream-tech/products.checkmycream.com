    <li> Smells wonderful and makes your skin very soft!</li>
    <li> Very expensive stuff and works just as well as coco butter and Aveeno. The scent is amazing though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this stuff for a long time. It&#x27;s glorious. A little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly. The smell is heavenly, and it&#x27;ll leave your skin soft, smooth, and happy -- whether you use it with the salt scrub or not. I bought the first pot at a yoga conference under a high-pressured sales pitch along with the salt scrub, some face products, etc. I spent a LOT of money. I did love the products, however, and went to look online after they ran out to see if I could get them cheaper. Suffice it to say -- they are WAY cheaper online than they will be if you buy from a kiosk or sales rep. I hate it that I&#x27;m saying this, because I don&#x27;t want to deny anyone a living, but as an adjunct professor, I live on minimum wage and this is a big treat. If I can get it a little cheaper, I can still treat myself to it.</li>
    <li> I had been given this by a grandson, but a different brand. This was half the size he gave me and that brand had a more subtle scent. This is okay but not as wonderful as that he gave me. It still serves the purpose of softening my skin.</li>
    <li> Product rapidly absorbs and soothes dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> Always a joy to have, love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in place of Deep Sea Cosmetics Milk and Honey body butter. This product has a very pleasant scent, and works just as well as the very costly product I was using before. It leaves the skin smooth and soft with no greasy residue. It&#x27;s a wonderful product for anyone suffering from dry skin. I use it for my children who suffer from seasonal dry skin as well. It is priced very competitively. The way the product is packaged is great. Seller shipped quickly. I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Great follow up to the hand crystals. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> Product tampered with, it definitely was NOT the original Premier product.</li>
    <li> All of the ladies I know, young and old, love this gift.  I honestly don&#x27;t have the words to praise this product enough.</li>
    <li> Great product not greasy feel on skin.  Recommend when you order, order atleast two, you will definitely be pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I just gave it to my daughter as a Birthday present. The aroma is wonderful &amp; I&#x27;m sure that she will love it.</li>
    <li> This body butter is luscious and creamy and absorbs well.  And smells good enough to eat. Does wonders on dry, chapped, or sunburned skin. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> This jar of lotion was packaged just right and it is the ultimate lotion for soft skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent. Feels nice</li>

This is the most fabulous cream that I&#x27;ve ever used. I have extremely sensitive skin and the natural ingredients don&#x27;t leave my skin angry or burning. I use it after my shower every night and my skin is smooth and soft and I always smell like milk and honey. I don&#x27;t have to wear other perfumes. Yes, the scent has changed slightly over the years, but still a fabulous, soft aroma which my husband adores. This jar lasts me about 6 months with nightly application. I love Love LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> Love this Body Butter. It is rich and creamy. It is slightly greasy, so you will need to rub it in well.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  It melts in contact and is easily absorbed.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff!  Recently discovered this line and have purchased several of their products.  This body butter is one of my favorites.  Some have complained about the scent but I think it&#x27;s wonderful; light and not overly sweet. Feels luxurious as you apply it, becoming more so as you rub it in. Makes a wonderful hand lotion too.  Leaves your skin feeling soft and pampered.</li>
    <li> This is so much better than perfume!  It&#x27;s a light cream and it sells really good - at least my husband thinks so.....</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  Very subtle fragrance and it makes my skin feel really soft.  I mainly use it on my &amp;#34;sun damaged&amp;#34; chest area and it makes it feel very smooth.  I feel like it heals it -  improves the texture and the look of my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and truly love it better than any other that I have ever tried!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer.  It is very light and absorbs quickly. It also has a yummy scent. I&#x27;ll be reordering it soon!</li>
    <li> The cream came all broken and therefore had to throw them.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the Best skin/foot cream I have ever used! Silky and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd purchase.  I love this body butter.  It smells so nice, isn&#x27;t greasy and the price is great!</li>
