    <li> Great to spray in wet hair to get tangles out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Fast Fix since it was in the different packaging, (approx. 10 years). It is a great leave in conditioner. I wish they would have left the original fragrance. It was awesome. Now, eh.</li>
    <li> i was madly in love with the catwalk fast fixx when it was in the blue bottle.  i had been using it for the past 6 years.  they said it&#x27;s the original formula, but it&#x27;s not. it smells terrible now.  i don&#x27;t even want to put this product in my hair.  just a nasty smell.  i&#x27;m already plotting how to give away the two bottles i bought of it so i&#x27;m not completely wasting my money.</li>
    <li> Awesome styling product!!</li>

    <li> Light but still holds hair in humidity</li>
    <li> When I switched to this and it wasn&#x27;t in the blue bottle, I was a little concerned.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sticky as it used to be.

    <li> Ive used this product for years...they changed it, it no longer works as a leave-inconditoner for me and the smell is somewhat dirty/musky smelling.  Tossing it and going to find another brand.  Too bad, in the blue bottle is was wonderful.  This actually makes my hair more tangled!</li>
    <li> Excellent spray... works wonderfully. Thank you for the quick arrival.</li>
    <li> This product is fine, but it is not the exact formula of the prior product in the blue bottle.  You just have to adjust the amount you use and it works ok.

    <li> Love this stuff for straightening my hair.  Especially great when I wash my hair the night before, seems to keep my hair from looking greasy the next day.</li>
