      <li>hehe looking good .thanx</li>
      <li>Good for the price, if you don&#x27;t mind smudges.  </li>
      <li>This is probably good for those who don&#x27;t mind touch-ups, but I don&#x27;t have time.  </li>
      <li>I think I like it, but this was surprising to me.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>A good gel liner that smudges.</li>
      <li>Looks great going on but smudges really easily - raccoon eyes!</li>
      <li>I love it, though!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I love this liner!</li>
      <li>For the price, this is amazing stuff.</li>
      <li>and it comes with its own brush....</li>
      <li>/&gt;Versatile, good quality, and cheap--what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>So far, this is the best eyeliner I have tried and stays on the longest.</li>
      <li>This applies very smoothly, and makes the cat eye look very easy to accomplish.  </li>
      <li>As it is, it&#x27;s still pretty great.</li>
      <li>it goes on very smooth with the brush.</li>
      <li>but you do need a good eye liner brush to use this gel eyeliner and make sure you clean your brush really good after every use becuz it can leave a lol hard, but it looks great on</li>
      <li>A slightly better formula would surely fix that.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I fell in love.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, LOVE this stuff.  </li>
      <li>i have used several gel eyeliners and this is one of the best for that price.</li>
      <li>I got so many compliments and questions about my liner.</li>
      <li>This stuff is ok, the reviews are way to generous.</li>
      <li>I have to say I am in love.</li>
      <li>, I look forward to purchasing more NYX products.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite gel liner in the world</li>
      <li>I was come rely satisfied with this gel eyeliner</li>
      <li>So much better than pencil and liquid.</li>
      <li>Goes on very smooth and easy.  </li>
      <li>Stays on most of the day and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I love it, I wish it came with brush, but its not so important to me.</li>
      <li>By far the best gel eyeliner closest thing to inglot but at a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>I rarely used gel liner because i&#x27;m a smudgy eye kind of girl</li>
      <li>Works great, dries fast so if you want to smudge it for Smokey eye, you gotta do it quick.</li>
      <li>This is pretty great for my first time using a gel liner.  </li>
      <li>Smudges easy</li>
      <li>It starts to fade after an hour, but still looks pretty amazing throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without a good liner</li>
      <li>This eyeliner is a great glossy black color and it looks nice for about an hour after you put it on, but every time I wear it it smears everywhere and I look like a racoon halfway through the day.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s transfers well and gives you a nice, intense color.</li>
      <li>I used it with an angled brush and it goes on smooth and light.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smooth</li>
      <li>Just as velvety smooth and long-wearing as MAC and Bobbi Brown.</li>
      <li>you just have to make sure you have the right brush</li>
      <li>, I went throught so many pages trying to find the right one</li>
      <li>Super black and Glides perfect</li>
      <li>I love this so much!</li>
      <li>Only a bit is needed to cover a good amount of space.  </li>
      <li>I only gave it four stars because it does wear off and start to smudge, but it lasts a good five to six hours without primer.</li>
      <li>versatile and it staying a true black is great.</li>
      <li>I like this eye liner gel, its so smooth, glides on so easily an lasts all day long,  Just wish it was more gel, or</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite gel liner.</li>
      <li>A great true black liner !</li>
      <li>Overall i love NYX gel liner!</li>
      <li>This liner is worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>I top this with Anastasia of Beverly Hill&#x27;s beauty genius (I lightly dab a tiny amount over the liner or anything else I might have  on)  and my eye makeup stays in place all day...</li>
      <li>It is definitely worth every dollar.</li>
      <li>so I mostly used genuine kohl from the Middle East.  </li>
      <li>Should definately buy and worth the price</li>
      <li>I love it jet black and very smooth</li>
      <li>, this is no difference, I use this for my eyebrows to kind of give that clean sharp line finish.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, and is a nice black and stays on all day.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite eye liner, blurs easy and stubborn enough to not come off without makeup remover.</li>
      <li>but when it arrived here the first thing I noticed was that there was no smudger.</li>
      <li>when i run out i&#x27;ll be back to buy more.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using gel eyeliner</li>
      <li>By far my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>But other than that it worked nicely</li>
      <li>Goes on very smooth and its a good dark black.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i have used several gel eyeliners and this is one of the best for that price. just make sure to save the plastic cap inside and keep it air tight to prevent from drying. gel eyeliners tend to dry quick. it goes on very smooth with the brush.</li>
    <li> Love all nyx products!!!</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth a little goes a long way you don&#x27;t need alot but you do need a good eye liner brush to use this gel eyeliner and make sure you clean your brush really good after every use becuz it can leave a lol hard, but it looks great on, I got cat eye going now ..hehe looking good .thanx a bunch (~.^)</li>
    <li> Dries very fast, only lasts approximately a month before I couldn&#x27;t tolerate blow drying it to make it go on more smoothly</li>
    <li> I love this so much! It took me years to find another alternative after I could no longer afford the Benefit gel liner. I purchased many of the cheaper ones that were often recommended to me to see if I was happy, but none made me as happy as this one. This gel liner costs just like the Maybelline gel liners(around $7-$9 depending on store and area), yet they have the same quality as the Benefit gel liner, which costs about $20. I was hoping I would not be disappointed and that I&#x27;d finally found a good replacement, and I did. It is definitely worth every dollar. I will be stocking up on these.</li>
    <li> Goes on beautifully! Less is definitely more when it comes to this product. I&#x27;ve used it as both a smudger AND a liner and was very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Only a bit is needed to cover a good amount of space.  It&#x27;s an amazing black pigment and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for winged eyeliner looks and the smudging quality is perfect for when you want a smoky, sultry edge to your eye makeup. I definitely would&#x27;ve liked it to be cheaper but other than that, I look forward to purchasing more NYX products.</li>
    <li> Creases REALLY fast... Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good! A bit pricey considering Maybelline makes one for about $8 and it comes with its own brush....but still I feel it lasts a bit longer, especially on my water line.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last through the day and was difficult to apply. Back to Maybelline Studio I go..</li>
    <li> This stuff is ok, the reviews are way to generous. Smudges easy</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! Although it does not come with a brush to apply the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using gel eyeliner and I fell in love.  It is so much easier to apply then liquid eyeliner and it goes on much easier.  I love the soft look (not such hard lines like liquid) and it is easy to smudge and make into a smokey eye if you want.  I did buy a thin brush to apply and it works amazing.</li>
    <li> I have had people tell me my eyes look bigger and brighter since wearing this. It goes on pretty heavy, so you may need to blend (I do). One piece if advice is to wash the eyeliner brush off as soon as you are done because it dries up and stiffens the brush, and if you didn&#x27;t clean the brush ahead of time, you are stuck using a stiff, hard brush in the morning. I love it, though!</li>
    <li> My new favorite eye liner, blurs easy and stubborn enough to not come off without makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this gel liner!  It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s reasonably priced, controllable, doesn&#x27;t dry out in the jar, stays put, and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with a skinny little bent handled eyeliner brush and, after a bit of practice, I&#x27;m rocking a cat eye.  On less flamboyant days, I can draw a thin line close to my lash line, top and bottom, for a no-makeup look.  I can also thicken the center, draw bottom lashes, or any combination of the above.  Great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versatile, good quality, and cheap--what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I love it. Really I do. It comes in a little glass pot, smaller than I expected but that&#x27;s my fault. Best gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> SO ...  I absolutely adore this product . the size was small but the first time I used it I realized that the term a little goes a long way goes perfect for this!! It dries and doesn&#x27;t smudge once it does. So no more raccoon eyes for me!! Try it!!</li>
    <li> This works well but when it arrived here the first thing I noticed was that there was no smudger. I was dissapoonted with that. But other than that it worked nicely</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, and is a nice black and stays on all day.  Wish it came with a brush though.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 months now wearing it everyday and still haven&#x27;t made a dent in it.  By far my new favorite.  So much better than pencil and liquid.</li>
    <li> I was come rely satisfied with this gel eyeliner I&#x27;m not good at putting on liquid eyeliner so I decided to try gel eyeliner, I went throught so many pages trying to find the right one and I can assure you this is just perfect you just have to make sure you have the right brush I will definetly but more of their products!!!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite gel liner. I am usually a felt-tip liquid liner type of gal, but liquid doesn&#x27;t always last through those hot summer days. Plus, I saw the price of this and I thought I would take a swing at it. I have to say I am in love. I have tried the Benefit gel liner and the Mac gel liner.. and this is comparable!! Once this dries and you set it with black shadow this stuff doesn&#x27;t move!! I have gone swimming with this and it stayed in place. If you are having trouble with the staying power, I suggest using a eyeshadow primer then going in with the liner. After that you set it with any kind of black eye shadow and it STAYS!! For the price, this is amazing stuff. I have always loved and will always love NYX!!</li>
    <li> Half way through the day it looked like I had a black eye.  I have never had this happen with any other eyeliner I have used.</li>
    <li> I bought this because people said it stays on.  It doesn&#x27;t stay put for me.  Its nice and black but then the black ends up where it isn&#x27;t supposed to be making this product useless.</li>
    <li> Many NYX products are great and a often a great value.  I won&#x27;t be using mine.  It smears.  Does not really set.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here but the product it&#x27;s self was what I needed. It isn&#x27;t overly hard to remove when taking off my make up which I liked compared to others I had before</li>
    <li> Perfect for all types and winged eyes. Last all day, no smudge caked up or creasing of product. I wish i could show u pic of this product. Overall i love NYX gel liner!</li>
    <li> Good product, very long lasting.  Can be tough to remove though</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner! One of my favorites! Stays on all day without smudging!</li>
    <li> I use eyeliner on my waterline and it always comes off within minutes. So far, this is the best eyeliner I have tried and stays on the longest. It starts to fade after an hour, but still looks pretty amazing throughout the day. This will always be my go-to eyeliner for my waterline until something longer-lasting is invented.</li>
    <li> This applies very smoothly, and makes the cat eye look very easy to accomplish.  Great product for the price.  My only complaint is, even with primer, it seems to leave residue on my upper eyelid after wearing for half the day.  I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to prevent this.</li>
    <li> This is my second day using it. It has staying power thus far. I purchased it on a whim based on other reviews. I&#x27;m not dissatisfied so far. One thing though; my brush is hard to clean now. Any suggestions as to how to get it off of my brush bristles properly? With the other gel product I was using, it came off the bristles just fine. With this product, no beuno! Helllppppppppppppp! I think I like it, but this was surprising to me.</li>
    <li> I use this eyeliner all of the time! It&#x27;s transfers well and gives you a nice, intense color. I only gave it four stars because it does wear off and start to smudge, but it lasts a good five to six hours without primer.</li>
    <li> Super black and Glides perfect</li>
    <li> A great true black liner !it can be applied to be a very sharp cat eye or smudged out with a brush or Q tip for a dramatic smokey eye. works great as a base for darker more dramatic looks. when i run out i&#x27;ll be back to buy more. I can&#x27;t live without a good liner and i think i found a new favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very versatile and it staying a true black is great.When products have multiple shades of black i get so mad.</li>
    <li> Very easy to put on and love the dark look, however, unlike other eyeliners I have used this rubs off on my upper eyelid throughout the day.  Not a cute look.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, if you don&#x27;t mind smudges.  Very pigmented, a vibrant jet black that glides on to make a smooth line. This is probably good for those who don&#x27;t mind touch-ups, but I don&#x27;t have time.  By the end of the day, it has migrated to the inside corner of my eyes and made panda circles under my eyes.  I top this with Anastasia of Beverly Hill&#x27;s beauty genius (I lightly dab a tiny amount over the liner or anything else I might have  on)  and my eye makeup stays in place all day...so I go with this in lieu of more expensive liners.  If you don&#x27;t put anything on top or waterproof anything, it won&#x27;t last more than a few hours.  I&#x27;ve found Urban Decays &amp;#34;cream liner&amp;#34; smudge pot is a similar product that lasts all day, just more expensive.  I switched back to NYX when I discovered the Beauty Genius waterproofing gel.  So happy with the savings.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this by accident reaching for another NYX box at the drugstore, but decided to keep it because I was out of gel liner anyway.  I rarely used gel liner because i&#x27;m a smudgy eye kind of girl so I mostly used genuine kohl from the Middle East.  But when I looked at the box and it said liner/smudger, I thought hmmm, how could that be?  We it&#x27;s turned out to be the best liner EVER!  It&#x27;s formula leaves it very workable for a longer time.  Want a perfect well defined line?  Apply it with your thin eyeliner brush and you&#x27;re done.  Want to smudge it?  Go over it with an empty eye shadow brush  Instant smudgy look.  How about doing what I do?  Adding eye shadow color into the smudge?  Just put color on the eye shadow brush before you start smudging and you&#x27;re got a perfect smudgy eye color that still has the definition right at the lash base.  I love, love, LOVE this stuff.  And I&#x27;ve used it every day since the happy accident of buying it.</li>
    <li> I love this liner! Usually, after a while, most liners fade but this lasted all day! I got so many compliments and questions about my liner. This is definitely my new staple!</li>
    <li> Just as velvety smooth and long-wearing as MAC and Bobbi Brown. But CHEAP!!!</li>
    <li> Loveeeee!!! By far the best gel eyeliner closest thing to inglot but at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Stays on most of the day and easy to apply. Should definately buy and worth the price</li>
    <li> I love it, I wish it came with brush, but its not so important to me. Works great, dries fast so if you want to smudge it for Smokey eye, you gotta do it quick.</li>
    <li> I like this eye liner gel, its so smooth, glides on so easily an lasts all day long,  Just wish it was more gel, or maybe  a bigger jar for the price.  But I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> A good gel liner that smudges. And sets if you don&#x27;t want to smudge it. This isn&#x27;t my favorite gel liner in the world but it&#x27;s good and I&#x27;d buy it again for the smudgey factor.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product love it</li>
    <li> This is pretty great for my first time using a gel liner.  I used it with an angled brush and it goes on smooth and light.  Stays on all day but I will say that it tends to smudge after a few hours and I end up with black smudges at the edges of my eyes.  A slightly better formula would surely fix that.  As it is, it&#x27;s still pretty great.</li>
    <li> This liner is great.  So beautiful on the eyes.  Goes on very smooth and easy.  This liner is worth every penny.  A little goes a very long way. Although the jar is small, you can tell it will last a very long time. I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is a great glossy black color and it looks nice for about an hour after you put it on, but every time I wear it it smears everywhere and I look like a racoon halfway through the day.</li>
    <li> Looks great going on but smudges really easily - raccoon eyes!</li>
    <li> I love it jet black and very smooth</li>
    <li> Goes on very smooth and its a good dark black. Only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t come with an applicator.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected I had it for about 2 weeks now &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it everyday &amp; have yet to make a dent in it if recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I really like nyx eye products, this is no difference, I use this for my eyebrows to kind of give that clean sharp line finish.</li>
    <li> Love this! Great quality! Great price.</li>
