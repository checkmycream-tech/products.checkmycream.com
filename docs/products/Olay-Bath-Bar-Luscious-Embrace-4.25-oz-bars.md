    <li> One thing that &amp;#34;rubbed off&amp;#34; from my divorce was this dang soap! It smells great. Leaves my skin clean &amp; without dryness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they keep making this &amp; the other varieties forever.</li>

    <li> This soap is wonderful. I&#x27;ve been buying it from local stores for a while but suddenly I can&#x27;t find it anywhere, so I&#x27;m happy I can order it online.
