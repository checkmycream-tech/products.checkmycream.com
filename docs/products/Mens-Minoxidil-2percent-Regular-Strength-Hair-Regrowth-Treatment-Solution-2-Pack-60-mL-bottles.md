      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, too.</li>
      <li>Fast processing of order.</li>
      <li>Other then that I am extremely pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>Currently using it once a day rather than the directed twice a day along with the special shampoo the itching has minimized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been applying this product per label directions for less than a month, (1 bottle not yet finished), and have noticeable improvement in the pattern baldness area at the top of my head.  </li>
      <li>My arm hair has become slightly thicker and darker and the hair on the top of my hands seems to be getting some colour too.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend using this product for a while to see its effect.</li>
      <li>Item came quickly, it was well packaged and assuming that I see some results (which I do expect as I&#x27;ve used it in the past with some success)</li>
      <li>I chose the 2% after hearing higher concentrations caused increased hair growth outside the targeted area.</li>
      <li>After about a month there was a marked improvement in the amount of new hairs that have come in on the rest of my face.</li>
      <li>Its too early to see results so will have to review again after I&#x27;ve used it a while.</li>
      <li>I used as direct with no issues and then when the 1st bottle ran out, I started to experience itching around my hairline and on the crown of my head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it does regrouth the hair since i&#x27;ve been using it for only a month, however i feel</li>
      <li>Although my hair is not as plentiful as it was when I was a teen, it certainly is not as thin as it was before I began using this product.  </li>
      <li>It is mild enough that it does not really affect the head, eyebrows, or hair on the rest of the body.  </li>
      <li>Little did I know that there is a HUGE difference between unscented and regular versions of this product.</li>
      <li>Not sure the 2% is strong enough but am giving it a try.</li>
      <li>I used  in the morning in beafore to go to bed my hair regrow by two and a half inches right now on that bald spot.  </li>
      <li>Really all I can rate is the handling of the order from this seller, as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results yet.</li>
      <li>I am 25 years old and have been using this off-label on my face to try and fill in my facial hair.</li>
      <li>I looked like Frankenstein&#x27;s monster at one point and aged 20 years, so much happened to my head and neck.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 51 year old female &amp; I&#x27;ve been using Minoxidil 2% for about 15 years.   </li>

<li> I&#x27;m a 51 year old female &amp; I&#x27;ve been using Minoxidil 2% for about 15 years.   </li>
<li> I am a woman at 60years old and I&#x27;ve been trying many products not seeing any results for 5years trying to find a product and spending so much money very expensive products.</li>
<li> It smelled like the most pungent rotten egg smell I could possibly imagine and it stayed that bad for over two full days even though I only used about 3/4 of a mL (which, in theory, is less than half a day&#x27;s supply).</li>
<li> Hairs have been few and far between outside my chin and mustache area for years.</li>
<li> Obviously I can&#x27;t confirm that it actually works, but I can say that there is no odor which I&#x27;ve seen from reviews of other minoxidil brands.  </li>
<li> but I have had this life long bald spot on my tzone that I thought was a birth mark.</li>
<li> I began scrubbing my scalp with a baking powder and water paste (with only small positive results) every few hours for about a 24 hour period.</li>
<li> Definitely going to be watching this very carefully.  </li>
<li> If you stop using the product, you will loose your hair</li>
<li> Not sure about the effects of this product, but so far, no real problems.</li>
<li> I used it for a few days and then my scalp became beet red.  </li>
<li> It leaves no residue behind, either oily or otherwise, so is much cleaner to use than I expected.</li>
<li> It has not filled in much of my thinning scalp, but I feel it at least has slowed down the shedding a bit.</li>
<li> I read in one of the reviews that this product doesn&#x27;t have the extreme side effects of Minoxidil 5%.</li>
<li> which due to my health issues, I have a problem with anyway-</li>
<li> This works about as well as any other minoxidil I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
<li> Balding isn&#x27;t a sign of poor health, it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
<li> It slows down hair loss, and regrows hair.</li>
<li> However, a few minutes after I applied the solution I noticed a sour smell.</li>
<li> ; so I used over the counter medicated shampoo which helped a little.</li>
<li> My husband has been using this product for a few years and it has helped with his hair loss.</li>
<li> I might update in a few months.</li>
<li> You should actually see a result sooner but keep in mind it needs to regenerate your dormant hair follicles and once that happens, hair grows at a rate of approximately 1/2 inch per month...</li>
<li> He does not like 5% because it is to stiff.</li>
<li> what was wrong with me, I finally had to go see my Dr. who put me on steroids to rid me of the toxins.</li>
<li> On the product itself: hard to say whether it helps.</li>
<li> I may have just had a bad reaction to it based on the condition of my scalp, but the smell was completely rancid.</li>
<li> At least for me, Minoxidil works.</li>
<li> I have been using this product for at least two years.</li>
<li> at least  3 times a week with a DHT blocking shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> Not only did the smell make me sick</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve since purchased an unscented version from the drug store and hope that I can put this experience behind me.</li>
<li> And if sun hits my head after I put it on my scalp the effects were worse- heat also causes vasodilation.</li>
<li> The problem itching got worse and soon involved flaking.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I tried to wear a hat for a while when I could.  </li>
<li> it made others around me sick.</li>
<li> After a couple of hours the odor became unbearable and made me sick.</li>
<li> If you want to get heart palpitations and a bloody nose try this out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product was purchased for my brother, and he truly likes it, because it works!!  He does not like 5% because it is to stiff.</li>
    <li> This works about as well as any other minoxidil I&#x27;ve tried.  Obviously I can&#x27;t confirm that it actually works, but I can say that there is no odor which I&#x27;ve seen from reviews of other minoxidil brands.  For the price, it&#x27;s good insurance to stop any further hair-loss!</li>
    <li> I am 25 years old and have been using this off-label on my face to try and fill in my facial hair. Hairs have been few and far between outside my chin and mustache area for years. After about a month there was a marked improvement in the amount of new hairs that have come in on the rest of my face. However, facial hair is still patchy so it will take several months, if at all, to fully fill it in. There seems to be diminishing returns with time. I chose the 2% after hearing higher concentrations caused increased hair growth outside the targeted area. It is mild enough that it does not really affect the head, eyebrows, or hair on the rest of the body.  May 28, 2015 Update: Approaching the end of my second bottle. Definitely noticing increased body hair throughout. My arm hair has become slightly thicker and darker and the hair on the top of my hands seems to be getting some colour too. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I am noticing more vellus hair on my upper arms and shoulders too. Definitely going to be watching this very carefully.  June 6, 2015 Update: Since around the time I started this product, I have had bumps on my upper arm form. I first thought it was acne, however it turns out it is Keratosis Pilaris. While it is genetic, I have never had this occur before with me. I am almost certain minoxidil triggered the Keratosis Pilaris. The expanding of the hair follicle that increased my hair growth into thicker darker arm hair may have triggered KP bumps under the now larger hair follicles. Just a word of caution if KP runs in your family. Starting to regret taking this now.  August 18, 2015 Update: I stopped taking this two months ago after being diagnosed with palpitations and erratic blood pressure, leading to episodes dizziness, nausea and feeling off, even one episode of double vision, which has resolved since then. Body hair has continued to grow thicker and longer in areas where it has never been applied even several weeks after discontinuing. The Keratosis Pilaris that appears on my chest and arms is as noticeable as ever and seems to be here to stay.</li>
    <li> Good price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Not sure about the effects of this product, but so far, no real problems. I have been using it for 2 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t received any side effects as of yet. I had FUT Surgery. I saw this was recommended to help speed up the process. I bought men&#x27;s 2% since this was more cost effective than the women&#x27;s 2%. The bottle says 1 2oz bottle should last a month if used 2x a day, but maybe I have a larger than recommended coverage area. I put this in a little spray bottle, the dropper was not as effective. I might update in a few months.</li>
    <li> Fast processing of order. All according to specifications.    On the product itself: hard to say whether it helps. I believe it stops the loss of hair, and may help with some regrowth. Only way to find out is to stop taking it, and I do not wish to take that risk :-)</li>
    <li> The product , Minoxidil, seems to work, but the odor which permeates your being is unbearable.  The odor icannot be masked and lingers after many hair washings.  had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I tried rogaine last year, but stopped because all I could find is the 5%.  I read that you can develop an immunity to this formula and it is best to start with 2% until results stop and the increase the dosage.     It comes with a dropper and is pretty easy to apply.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 months now and am very happy with the results so far.  Noticeable regrowth, but it isn&#x27;t significant yet.     I&#x27;m also using it on my receding hairline so I&#x27;m very happy with the results as I understand this product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone on that area of the scalp.</li>
    <li> The price is right and works just as good as Rogain. I would order it again and have told others about it.</li>
    <li> I believe this product causes some vasodilation of blood vessels- which due to my health issues, I have a problem with anyway- and I get light headed, dizzy and nauseated. And if sun hits my head after I put it on my scalp the effects were worse- heat also causes vasodilation. so I have had to find another product to help prevent hair loss.</li>
    <li> I had been using Minoxidil 5% for a few months and realized that I was just getting too much dandruff. I read in one of the reviews that this product doesn&#x27;t have the extreme side effects of Minoxidil 5%. So, I decided to start using Minoxidil 2% instead in hopes that I could continue to grow back some hair without having dandruff all over my shirt at the end of the day. Little did I know that there is a HUGE difference between unscented and regular versions of this product. The package arrived sooner than I had anticipated and exactly as I&#x27;d ordered. So, I wouldn&#x27;t want to make it seem like the seller was irresponsible.  However, a few minutes after I applied the solution I noticed a sour smell. After a couple of hours the odor became unbearable and made me sick. It smelled like the most pungent rotten egg smell I could possibly imagine and it stayed that bad for over two full days even though I only used about 3/4 of a mL (which, in theory, is less than half a day&#x27;s supply). I&#x27;m not being hyperbolic when I say that using this product has been a fairly traumatic experience. Not only did the smell make me sick it made others around me sick. I have had to avoid public contact for the last three days. I began scrubbing my scalp with a baking powder and water paste (with only small positive results) every few hours for about a 24 hour period. However, that seems to be drying my scalp out and making me lose some of the hair I&#x27;d recently begun to grow back.  I would not recommend this product to anyone. I may have just had a bad reaction to it based on the condition of my scalp, but the smell was completely rancid. I&#x27;ve since purchased an unscented version from the drug store and hope that I can put this experience behind me.</li>
    <li> Used this for several months and per my hairdresser, it seemed to be stimulating hair growth. I was very pleased and felt I saw my part getting narrower. I decided to try this because my MD said women can use men&#x27;s strength if they can tolerate it. I used as direct with no issues and then when the 1st bottle ran out, I started to experience itching around my hairline and on the crown of my head.&lt;br /&gt;I was also trying a different hairspray and assumed it was the culprit and d/c it. The problem itching got worse and soon involved flaking. It sometimes felt like my scalp had &amp;#34;cradle cap&amp;#34; so I used over the counter medicated shampoo which helped a little. Currently using it once a day rather than the directed twice a day along with the special shampoo the itching has minimized.&lt;br /&gt;I think in the future I will avoid this and stick with the Walmart brand of women&#x27;s strength minoxidile.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it twice a day with no problems. I&#x27;ve used minoxidil for years and it has greatly reduced my hair loss, so it&#x27;s nice to find it for such a reasonable price.  Fast shipping, too.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strength is it&#x27;s strong suit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must be consistent and shampoo your hair at least  3 times a week with a DHT blocking shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also consider taking an oral DHT blocker</li>
    <li> Not sure the 2% is strong enough but am giving it a try. Its too early to see results so will have to review again after I&#x27;ve used it a while.</li>
    <li> If you want to get heart palpitations and a bloody nose try this out.  Balding isn&#x27;t a sign of poor health, it&#x27;s natural.  If you want to look cool just buy the Bobcat Headband with Hair Mullet from Amazon instead.</li>
    <li> Effective &amp; cheap. I highly recommend using this product for a while to see its effect. It takes some time.</li>
    <li> Really all I can rate is the handling of the order from this seller, as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results yet. Item came quickly, it was well packaged and assuming that I see some results (which I do expect as I&#x27;ve used it in the past with some success), I won&#x27;t hesitate to order from here again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 51 year old female &amp; I&#x27;ve been using Minoxidil 2% for about 15 years.   It&#x27;s the same formula as Rogain so shop for the cheapest Minoxidil you can find. Although my hair is not as plentiful as it was when I was a teen, it certainly is not as thin as it was before I began using this product.  I understand it does not work for everyone.  You need to use it for 4 months before you see a result.  You should actually see a result sooner but keep in mind it needs to regenerate your dormant hair follicles and once that happens, hair grows at a rate of approximately 1/2 inch per month...so the beginning growths will be short until they are grown out.  If you stop using the product, you will loose your hair so it&#x27;s basically a forever commitment.  Better than living with thin hair!  Final note, I have never had side effects, except when I tried the 5% formula which made my head itch uncontrollably!</li>
    <li> This stuff put me out of commission for two weeks. I had no idea what was wrong with me, I finally had to go see my Dr. who put me on steroids to rid me of the toxins. I looked like Frankenstein&#x27;s monster at one point and aged 20 years, so much happened to my head and neck. Run from it, tell your friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least two years. It has not filled in much of my thinning scalp, but I feel it at least has slowed down the shedding a bit. It is inexpensive, does not smell or interfere with styling and I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I noticed that my hair was thinning and started my research. I discovered that Minoxidil seems to still be the treatment of choice, even after many years. I put it on my scalp with a dropper after I get into bed each night. It leaves no residue behind, either oily or otherwise, so is much cleaner to use than I expected. And...it works.</li>
    <li> At least for me, Minoxidil works. It slows down hair loss, and regrows hair. This was a good deal, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> effective and well priced compared to others on the market.  service delivery met all my expectations and treatment is working well</li>
    <li> So far so good. My husband has no complaints. Will update later as time goes on and he sees results.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for a few years and it has helped with his hair loss.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product, the reasonable price. I will keep shopping this product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I am sure that this product works, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I used it for a few days and then my scalp became beet red.  It looked like it was on fire and felt the same way.  Needless to say, I tried to wear a hat for a while when I could.  Oh well, hoped I could use it but turned out I couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Ladies, 2% Minoxidil is one thing, and it works for people with pattern baldness (alopecia).  The box label &amp;quot;For Men&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;For Women&amp;quot; is marketing.  I&#x27;ve been applying this product per label directions for less than a month, (1 bottle not yet finished), and have noticeable improvement in the pattern baldness area at the top of my head.  I&#x27;d say that if your doctor says it&#x27;s OK, go for it.  It may well help you, too.</li>
    <li> I am a woman at 60years old and I&#x27;ve been trying many products not seeing any results for 5years trying to find a product and spending so much money very expensive products. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months and I&#x27;m very happy I used  in the morning in beafore to go to bed my hair regrow by two and a half inches right now on that bald spot.  I really recommend it to anybody to try  for one month and you will see the difference. I am very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if it does regrouth the hair since i&#x27;ve been using it for only a month, however i feel like im losing less hair, so, as for me, te product worked nice!  U can&#x27;t expect a miracle but it deserves 5 stars anyway!</li>
    <li> It does what it is advertised to do:)</li>
    <li> Didnt believe the hype but I have had this life long bald spot on my tzone that I thought was a birth mark. I started using shea butter mixed with this and BOOM. Hair folicles started opening and hair started to grow. I was extremely happy and I hope it continues to work and keep those hair  folicles open and hair drowing there. The product kind of smells chemical, but kind of expected it. Other then that I am extremely pleased with the product.</li>
