      <li>I trIed the original &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Tried and true user of this flavor/brand.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my breath consistently fresh.  </li>
      <li>This is an exciting product.  </li>
      <li>This product is a must-have for me - every bit as much as toothpaste - so I like that I can order it in bulk on Amazon for pretty cheap.</li>
      <li>This will help soften and feel tingly, but be aware....</li>

      <li>Just be aware of that.</li>

      <li>I think Listerine mouthwash is so much stronger than many of the other brands.</li>
      <li>Perfect size to use as a foot-wash for tired, rough feet.&lt;br</li>
      <li>soak in 1 cup of Listerine, 1 cup of white vinegar and 2 cups of warm water;  double or triple to allow enough for soak.  </li>
      <li>WOW!</li>
      <li>I do highly recommend the product...but paying twice as much for it just to have it delivered to your door is a personal choice and one which doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>Its good but sort of expensive.</li>
      <li>They are not the more common standard size.</li>

<li> there may be a little blue left behind on your feet :)</li>
<li> But seriously now....this 2 pack is readily available at any Costco for $9.99 and sometimes even less with a coupon.</li>
<li> thinking it was the hard stuff, but hated the taste, so the fresh burst works out a lot better for me.</li>
<li> I bought these two large bottles of Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash because it not only freshens bad breathe &amp; kills germs</li>
<li> Add a little Listerine to your water flosser and your mouth will thank you for it.</li>
<li> /&gt;Seems like at least an annual supply, even if you use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> ... you can&#x27;t go wrong with them.</li>
<li> /&gt;Maybe houses of ill repute buy these.</li>
<li> Use it every day and never have issues with bad breath.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an exciting product.  I am very pleases to recommend this to all.  I appreciate the two pack.  You will enjoy the taste.</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth and freshens my breath instantly. I appreciate the intensity of the wash compared to other/cheaper products. WOW!</li>
    <li> Very expensive&lt;br /&gt;I get the same item for 7 something in the another store close to my house</li>
    <li> I like this flavor for a mouthwash. It is &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;, not too much like &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34;. It is &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;, but that makes it feel like it is working. I was not a big mouthwash person but I tried using this recently and now I am hooked.</li>
    <li> I bought these two large bottles of Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash because it not only freshens bad breathe &amp; kills germs but it also helps to prevent the Gum Disease known as Gingivitis. Which I thinks is important.</li>
    <li> This product is a must-have for me - every bit as much as toothpaste - so I like that I can order it in bulk on Amazon for pretty cheap. This is my favorite flavor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note - the bottles are HUGE. Just be aware of that. They are not the more common standard size.</li>
    <li> I love it because I didn&#x27;t have to go anywhere to get it.</li>
    <li> I think Listerine mouthwash is so much stronger than many of the other brands. Love the fresh flavor. Price is good.</li>
    <li> Favorite product - easier to purchase</li>
    <li> Use it and your breath won&#x27;t stink...  What can I say it&#x27;s Listerine... you can&#x27;t go wrong with them.</li>
    <li> About the Sam price as target. Yet I do not need to leave the house. A needed product that works</li>
    <li> But seriously now....this 2 pack is readily available at any Costco for $9.99 and sometimes even less with a coupon. I do highly recommend the product...but paying twice as much for it just to have it delivered to your door is a personal choice and one which doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I just enjoy this product it is the best for me!</li>
    <li> Use twice a day.  Can&#x27;t go on without it!</li>
    <li> Great transaction! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Tastes much better than the original flavor and still does the job of keeping your breath fresh and mouth feels clean</li>
    <li> Perfect size to use as a foot-wash for tired, rough feet.&lt;br /&gt;10-minute soak in 1 cup of Listerine, 1 cup of white vinegar and 2 cups of warm water;  double or triple to allow enough for soak.  This will help soften and feel tingly, but be aware....there may be a little blue left behind on your feet :)</li>
    <li> i swish some around in my mouth every morning after brushing my teeth.  I trIed the original &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; thinking it was the hard stuff, but hated the taste, so the fresh burst works out a lot better for me.</li>
    <li> This is the only mouthwash I use any more. It&#x27;s very effective and I love the taste!</li>
    <li> Fresh and potent gets me going in the morning.</li>
    <li> I know you can get this same value from Costco but having it delivered without having to wait in line is better. I prefer to use Listerine as that&#x27;s what I grew up using. Add a little Listerine to your water flosser and your mouth will thank you for it.</li>
    <li> Its good but sort of expensive. I guess you pay for convenience.</li>
    <li> Tried and true user of this flavor/brand.  Use it every day and never have issues with bad breath.  Can&#x27;t ever go back to brushing alone now!</li>
    <li> GIANT sized double package of mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good value; best per ounce price on name-brand high quality mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like at least an annual supply, even if you use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe houses of ill repute buy these.</li>
    <li> Perfect size bottles and supply for our family.  Listerine is a product we have used in our house for over 30 years.</li>
    <li> Keeps my breath consistently fresh.  I don&#x27;t want to end up with gingivitis.</li>
    <li> Great taste.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I never try not to run out of this product I luuuuuuuuuv the way it makes my mouth feel after you rinse my mouth feel healthy clean and odor free it&#x27;s strong stuff but it&#x27;s the Bomb!</li>
