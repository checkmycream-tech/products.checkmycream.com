      <li>The wand is wonderful and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s what allows it to leave my lashes feeling wonderful.</li>
      <li>would say, give it a try for this great price!</li>
      <li>but it is still awesome!</li>
      <li>and I was very impressed!</li>
      <li>then this is great for you!</li>

      <li>and it has lasted beautifully throughout the day and even withstood sweaty workouts.  </li>
      <li>This product is a great drug store lengthening mascara.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake and the formula is great</li>
      <li>I liked it, but it&#x27;s not the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It just didn&#x27;t seem very effective.</li>
      <li>If this mascara were to have a bit more staying power it would be the perfect 5 star mascara</li>
      <li>I really liked it!</li>
      <li>It is really good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good price point.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s even a good price.</li>
      <li>because I had 3 people say my eyelashes looked good or fuller etc.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t come close to the clump crusher, but this is definitely good for day use.</li>
      <li>This mascara is a good size at a good price point and is fairly effective.</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I absoultey love it and reccomened it to anyone!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
      <li>First, the brush itself is excellent!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on clumpy, and separates the lashes nicely.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own for a couple of days.</li>
      <li>COVERGIRL is already a great brand, and all their mascaras are awesome but this one just has a different feel to it.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this on my own because of the wand issue.</li>
      <li>I was sent this product by influenster, but always give an honest review</li>
      <li>So far, this has been the best mascara I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I think the mascara is okay for a day time look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light too!</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t clumpy when applied and it for sure made my eyelashes a lot fuller.</li>
      <li>I would say it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>Only thing that kept it from being perfect was it wasn&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
      <li>The formula for this mascara is also another part that i love.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s a good product for those who like to wear mascara every day (since it doesn&#x27;t come off right away), but I do not.</li>
      <li>but this mascara is becoming one of my favorite.</li>
      <li>I received the Covergirl Lash Bloom Mascara complimentary from Influenster for review purposes and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>The other thing I wasn&#x27;t real happy with is that this mascara does not come off!</li>
      <li>At first I was hesitant, but after using this for a week I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-clumping and easy to built formula</li>
      <li>Does not clump or smear, comes off easily.</li>
      <li>Since this isn&#x27;t the clump crusher it can clump, but the brush makes it easy to get rid of.</li>
      <li>That means i can get all the lashes easily instead of struggling with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the CoverGirl Clump Crusher</li>
      <li>I received this product to review for free to review from Influenster.</li>
      <li>I recived this free to try.</li>

      <li>so when Influenster sent me this product free to try and after trying to review I was excited.  </li>
      <li>It lifted and separated my lashes beautifully, gave them a nice, full appearance without looking fake and the color wasn&#x27;t too much which is perfect for me because I like a more natural look.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this mascara I think it&#x27;s my new favorite</li>

      <li>I used it everyday for a week and loved the results!</li>
      <li>I love the way it made my lashes lift and separate, and stand out since they&#x27;re fairly light naturally.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a super buildable formula.</li>
      <li>What I enjoyed most was that the mascara itself doesn&#x27;t make your lashes look gross, clumpy, or crunchy.</li>
      <li>I still prefer a high end mascara for more volume</li>
      <li>I honestly was expecting it to be flaky and like many other mascaras, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It makes application so easy and really pulls the lashes apart.</li>

      <li>its job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>It made my eyelashes soft and didn&#x27;t make them clumpy like most mascaras do to my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>This mascara is very easy to apply, only takes one coat to make lashes appear more defined and lush.  </li>

      <li>I really like the formula of this mascara, though it is more dry than most.</li>

      <li>I have really sensitive eyes and skin and frequently end up &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; off any kind of make up when I can tell that it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>and I really like it!  </li>

      <li>I tried this out because it had such good reviews, but it&#x27;s one of my least favorite mascara products.</li>

      <li>This mascara is definitely for a softer look, than a bold one.</li>
      <li>The only reason I am giving it a 4/5 is because I have to put on like 3-4 coats to get the max effect of the fullness so it would run out quickly.</li>
      <li>I really do like this product – it makes your lashes super long and does not clump!</li>
      <li>that is COMPLETELY INACCURATE!!</li>
      <li>I fell in love, seriously the brush makes an easy application and you only need one coat!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this one. It lifted and separated my lashes beautifully, gave them a nice, full appearance without looking fake and the color wasn&#x27;t too much which is perfect for me because I like a more natural look. What I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the claim of it leaving your lashes soft- that is COMPLETELY INACCURATE!! They were quite stiff actually. The other thing I wasn&#x27;t real happy with is that this mascara does not come off! My eyes were red and burning and the area surrounding them became inflamed and irritated from struggling to remove this mascara. It was awful. I actually had to go out and BUY an oil based eye makeup remover and even that did not take it off completely!! I had to let it wear off on it&#x27;s own for a couple of days. Maybe it&#x27;s a good product for those who like to wear mascara every day (since it doesn&#x27;t come off right away), but I do not. I would think twice before buying this. Would love the product if it wasn&#x27;t so difficult to remove. I&#x27;m actually considering writing to Covergirl to complain. Waste of money for me because I will not use it again.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok, does not live up to recommendation on website</li>
    <li> I received this mascara complimentary via influenster vox box. I think the mascara is okay for a day time look. It&#x27;s a good price point. I like that the wand really separates and lengthens lashes. It&#x27;s not my favorite mascara. I would say it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> So far, this has been the best mascara I have ever tried. COVERGIRL is already a great brand, and all their mascaras are awesome but this one just has a different feel to it. First off, it left my lashes soooo soft when i applied it. I honestly was expecting it to be flaky and like many other mascaras, but it wasn&#x27;t. In addition, i like the brush because its covered with bristles. That means i can get all the lashes easily instead of struggling with it. The formula for this mascara is also another part that i love. ts made of beeswax and that&#x27;s what allows it to leave my lashes feeling wonderful. They &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; everyday and i like how they incorporated it as a flower!! **received product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster** ‪#‎goBloom‬</li>
    <li> I received this mascara complimentary of Influenster and have been using it for a week straight. First, the brush itself is excellent! It makes application so easy and really pulls the lashes apart. With the option of using the cap for the mascara, you can wash the brush after each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this has 4, not 5, stars is because as someone with sensitive eyes, the mascara did burn a little upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say, give it a try for this great price!</li>
    <li> I really do like this product – it makes your lashes super long and does not clump! And of course, it’s super black.  The one complaint I have is that the mascara tube is pretty slick, so it’s kind of hard to easily open, and the tube is pretty bulky.  Other than the packaging though, the mascara does its job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy &amp; makes your lashes super long! It isn&#x27;t as dark as I would like but it is still awesome!</li>
    <li> I just received my lash bloom vox box from influenster. I recived this free to try. This mascara is a good size at a good price point and is fairly effective. It doesn&#x27;t clump and lengthens lasges. It does have a few drawbacks. The wand is hard plastic. I&#x27;m wondering if it will soften up over time. Its almost impossible to get to smaller parts of the eye because of the size and inflexibility of the wand. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this on my own because of the wand issue.</li>
    <li> I received the Covergirl Lash Bloom Mascara complimentary from Influenster for review purposes and it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve tried it for a week and my eyelashes look fuller and longer than normal. I would definitely purchase an other one once I&#x27;m done with it :)</li>
    <li> I was given this product free to test by Influenster and Covergirl. I liked it, but it&#x27;s not the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried. The mascara is average, but if you&#x27;re looking for the everyday trustworthy mascara then this is great for you!</li>
    <li> I just recieved this product from influenster as a sample to try and I love it! It is really good a seperating your lashes and adds volume. It&#x27;s light too!</li>
    <li> I received this product around a week ago and I have been trying it out since. I really like the formula of this mascara, though it is more dry than most. This mascara really lengthens and makes my lashes more full, while staying soft. There are only a couple of things that I dislike about this mascara, one being that the wand is hard plastic, so you need to be careful to not hurt yourself, two the wand is not flexible so its harder to get around the ends, and three is that it&#x27;s not a buildable mascara. What I mean by it not being buildable is after a second coat, it starts getting clumpy. I personally like to use this mascara in combination with my covergirl flamed out mascara. As a contact lense wearer I like that this product is safer to use. I received this product inexchange for my opinion through influenster.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised!  This mascara is very easy to apply, only takes one coat to make lashes appear more defined and lush.  Does not clump or smear, comes off easily.</li>
    <li> This mascara was send to me from Influenster to test and review. I was a little hesitant about this product, because I am not a huge fan of the Lash Blast, but this was great after trying it for a couple weeks. It&#x27;s non-clumping and easy to built formula won me over. It also made my lashes feel SUPER soft! And it&#x27;s even a good price. I would recommend this to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> I received this mascara courtesy of Influenster for testing purposes. At first I was hesitant, but after using this for a week I love it! The wand is wonderful and doesn&#x27;t clump. It&#x27;s a plastic applicator instead of a softer bristled one, which I like. It fans out my lashes and makes my eyes look larger. I will continue to purchase this mascara in the future!</li>
    <li> This product was given to me complimentary of influenster, and I wore it straight for 7 days without even noticing my habits. I fell in love, seriously the brush makes an easy application and you only need one coat! It doesn&#x27;t flake and the formula is great, you go cover girl!</li>
    <li> I tried this out because it had such good reviews, but it&#x27;s one of my least favorite mascara products. I didn&#x27;t feel like the wand created fuller lashes and in fact, I had to apply several coats to see any difference at all. It didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It just didn&#x27;t seem very effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this mascara I think it&#x27;s my new favorite it leaves my lashes looking long and feeling lite</li>
    <li> I received this mascara free to try from Influenster. I used it everyday for a week and loved the results! It made my eyelashes soft and didn&#x27;t make them clumpy like most mascaras do to my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I received this mascara complimentary of influenster. This mascara is definitely for a softer look, than a bold one. It doesn&#x27;t come close to the clump crusher, but this is definitely good for day use. I like how the brush is big because other brushes can be flimsy and doesn&#x27;t really let you get in there. Since this isn&#x27;t the clump crusher it can clump, but the brush makes it easy to get rid of. It doesn&#x27;t leave your eye lashes hard or crunchy looking which is a plus is my book.</li>
    <li> I recieved this mascara for free from Influenster, and I have to say, it may have converted me from department store brands. I love the way it made my lashes lift and separate, and stand out since they&#x27;re fairly light naturally. Plus it didn&#x27;t flake or melt down, so I felt confident wearing it everywhere I went. Only thing that kept it from being perfect was it wasn&#x27;t waterproof. I&#x27;ll have two try that one next ;)</li>
    <li> I would never buy this again. It doesn&#x27;t do what the description says. It&#x27;s very messy and thick.</li>
    <li> I received this mascara complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes and I was very impressed! It doesn&#x27;t go on clumpy, and separates the lashes nicely. Usually, when I try to do multiple coats of mascara (even with dry time in between) it doesn&#x27;t sit well but this one does! I love how full and long it makes my lashes. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> get this when it total $0.7 to china.love it!</li>
    <li> I must say this is an impressive mascara that gives great separation, volume, and length to your lashes. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t flake off!  have been wearing is mascara for a week now and it has lasted beautifully throughout the day and even withstood sweaty workouts.  Any ladies out there looking for a long lasting, soft voluptuous mascara give Full Lash Bloom a try! I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I recieved this mascara via influenster. I really liked it! I&#x27;m not a huge make up person in the first place but this didn&#x27;t disappoint me. It wasn&#x27;t clumpy when applied and it for sure made my eyelashes a lot fuller. I know people around me noticed a difference as well because I had 3 people say my eyelashes looked good or fuller etc.</li>
    <li> I recieved this mascara conplimenty of Influenster to try out and review. I&#x27;m a huge fan of the CoverGirl Clump Crusher so I was excited to try this one out. What I enjoyed most was that the mascara itself doesn&#x27;t make your lashes look gross, clumpy, or crunchy. The formula dries soft and doesn&#x27;t flake off. It&#x27;s a super buildable formula. The only thing I did not like was the size of the brush. It was difficult to get to the root of the lashes. Other than that I absoultey love it and reccomened it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have tried this mascara for a week now and I&#x27;m in love with it! It really spreads out the lashes without clumping them. I would definitely recommend this mascara to anyone that wants fuller and lengther lashes.</li>
    <li> I received this product to review for free to review from Influenster. This product is a great drug store lengthening mascara. Takes 2 coats to build up enough volume for my liking. My eyelashes are not clumpy or stiff. I still prefer a high end mascara for more volume but I use this mascara frequently and even keep it in my makeup bag. I would definitely recommend for the price point.</li>
    <li> I have been using the CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom Mascara for 7 days now and I really like it!  I am very picky when it comes to mascara so when Influenster sent me this product free to try and after trying to review I was excited.  I love that the mascara really lengthens and separates your lashes!  It provides the fullness and length that other mascaras do without the stiffness. My lashes are long, full and soft!  I would definitely recommend this mascara to others.  The only reason I am giving it a 4/5 is because I have to put on like 3-4 coats to get the max effect of the fullness so it would run out quickly.</li>
    <li> I got 3 at the price of 1. But even then I hate the product, The brush is really harsh on the eyelashes and it takes more than two coats to show that I have mascara on.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara because it doesn&#x27;t automatically clump to every single one of my lashes. I put on two to three coats for optimum wear because I like thick dark lashes. I also really like this brush because it separates really well.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give 4/5 is because it takes quite a bit to dry. I was sent this product by influenster, but always give an honest review (:</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample of the product from influenster and in previous mascaras clumping was a big issue for me, but I found that in the lash blast bloom I didn&#x27;t see clumps to be a problem.</li>
    <li> I received this mascara complimentary of influenster for testing purposes. I was so shocked by how well this mascara made my lashes look,I normally use more expensive brands such as urban decay and too faced but this mascara is becoming one of my favorite. it doesn&#x27;t clump or make your lashes feel hard.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive eyes and skin and frequently end up &amp;#34;rubbing&amp;#34; off any kind of make up when I can tell that it&#x27;s there. After hemming and hawing at a drug store trying to decide what mascara to buy, I ended up picking up a tube in &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; due to the claims of soft lashes since hard and sticky lashes from mascara are annoying to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing I have received loads of compliments from people on my lashes and wonderment when I tell them that my lashes stay soft and that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off one star as I have noticed that by the end of a day at work that there is significantly less mascara on my lashes then there was when I started work despite the fact that this mascara does not make me want to rub my eyes. I am not the type who likes to have to reapply during the day, but I also do not like waterproof mascaras which are impossible to get off.  If this mascara were to have a bit more staying power it would be the perfect 5 star mascara and I would never look anywhere else. But then again, I may not look anywhere else.</li>
