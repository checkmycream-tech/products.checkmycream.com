      <li>Love this lash boosting serum.  </li>
      <li>Need more time to check it out.</li>
      <li>BUT WHY IT IS BETTER PRICED HERE</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>I started using this stuff and like magic well</li>
      <li>I love the applicator.</li>
      <li>I have tried many eyelash growth products.  </li>
      <li>Been using it for a while and love the effect of the lashes.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t in a plastic package like most mascaras are.  </li>
      <li>I havent been using this product for long at all, about a week; and I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I tell you that my best friend and I noticed results within 2 or 3 days after use.</li>
      <li>I noticed a difference right away, and I am going to order more ASAP!  </li>
      <li>My lashes are huge, I LOVE them.  </li>
      <li>make up I love to have fabulous looking eyes</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on luxuries like make up, so for me to buy something regularly, especially something like this that you cannot even see if it doesn&#x27;t work, it better be good, and this stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>They also aren&#x27;t falling out as easily as they used to be.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as easy to apply as mascara.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Application is fairly easy with the curved applicator.  </li>
      <li>easy to use and just apply before you go to sleep.</li>
      <li>It makes it easy to get it where it needs to go without having to stick yourself in the eye.</li>
      <li>Of course it&#x27;s too early to notice any growth or thickness, but am very happy so far.</li>
      <li>After about two weeks I can see a huge difference in the length, thickness, and how curly my lashes are.</li>
      <li>Great price, same product that&#x27;s in the store &amp; cheaper.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing and it really works.  </li>
      <li>Not only does this work great</li>
      <li>I started seeing the light tips become darker.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten really great results from this, not only on my lashes, but brows too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After a week, the spot was 100% filled in.</li>
      <li>and I have always had great eyelashes, but one day they were all of a sudden shorter.  </li>
      <li>And my brows look completely filled in now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Fantastic.  </li>
      <li>do far so good for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The mascara that I use, and love!, is \\&quot;Maybelline Classic Volume Express\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This eyelash enhancing (growth I hope) product has a unique split that curves to match the shape of the eyelid.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>but good enough to warrant 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>wow it does a nice job but at $100 per bottle</li>
      <li>Amazon did a good job crediting the amount back after I reported this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If my lashes were black, I wouldn&#x27;t bother using mascara anymore because they look so beautiful.</li>
      <li>My lashes start thickening up quickly.</li>
      <li>When I start it up again, I see quick improvements.</li>
      <li>I do not have an abundance of lashes nor are my lashes long and gorgeous.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes have grown much longer since using it and don&#x27;t fall out as easily.</li>
      <li>Once I got my eyelashes to where I was happy I replaced Latisse and continued on using Loreal everyday.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it though.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i did notice a difference, would buy again</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and love it.  My lashes are long to begin with but recently they hadn&#x27;t been as dense as they used to be.  Using this product both morning and night, I have noticed a difference in the thickness of my lashes.  They also aren&#x27;t falling out as easily as they used to be.  They feel super soft too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lash primers before, but this worked more like a conditioner than primer. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Love this lash boosting serum.  Been using it for a while and love the effect of the lashes.  Don&#x27;t need mascara, but if I do apply it, it makes lashes look even longer and fuller.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh this has helped so much! After about two weeks I can see a huge difference in the length, thickness, and how curly my lashes are. I would recommend just putting it on the roots of your lashes because applying it to your actual lashes doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
    <li> I not only use it for my eye lashes but use it for my eye brows! I know it sounds crazy but it actually helped my thinning eyebrows grow back. The only thing is I have to use it every other day for it to sustain the hair growth. It&#x27;s worth it though. I have never had really thick eyebrows and am so happy to see them grow back. I use them at night after I cleanse and moisturize my face.</li>
    <li> My lashes are still weak but is working, they are longer.</li>
    <li> The item was never received. Amazon did a good job crediting the amount back after I reported this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought the same product at Wal-Mart, a bit pricier.  But I&#x27;ve not used it long enough (1.5 weeks) to decide whether it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is fairly easy with the curved applicator.  The product it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my eyes or skin.  It is a bit \\&quot;thick,\\&quot; so I&#x27;m wondering how mascara would work over it - I haven&#x27;t used both at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost seems like a thin layer of plastic coating is being put on your eyelashes and the base of them.</li>
    <li> not sure if my eyelashes are longer now, but it does help with stopping it fall off all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt use it everyday. so I guess if I use it all the time it will be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a little bit itchy if you get some on your eyeball, but totally bearable.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I started with this a few months ago. I have used it fairly religiously twice a day, and now have the best eyelashes I&#x27;ve ever had (at 61yrs.!)It can be worn under mascara fyi. I will buy on Amazon from now on--it&#x27;s much cheaper than my former source.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. I did not see any changes, but on the other hand I did not apply it every day. This product is just not for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It truly does improve eye lash health and appearance. My eye lashes had become sparse, short, and fragile. I used to leave mascara on for days. I now know that causes a lot of the problems I had with my eye lashes. In my research, I also found out that lashes need nutrients and to be conditioned much like hair and nails. After about a month of using this product faithfully two times daily, my lashes are more dense, longer, and over all fuller. If my lashes were black, I wouldn&#x27;t bother using mascara anymore because they look so beautiful. Seriously!</li>
    <li> People don&#x27;t believe I don&#x27;t have mascara on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this stuff ALL THE TIME.  my eyes and skin are very sensitive.  I get a little burning, nothing intollerable, when I apply it as an eyeliner, and then it goes away after a minute or so.  That&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with regular use I saw latisse like results like people said.  My lashes are huge, I LOVE them.  I&#x27;m obsessed with big lashes and eye make up I love to have fabulous looking eyes whenever I can, so I use this stuff all the time.  I dont use the mascara, I just use the lash serum, and I suggest it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go through it fast too because I&#x27;m always using it.  It&#x27;s amazing and it really works.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on luxuries like make up, so for me to buy something regularly, especially something like this that you cannot even see if it doesn&#x27;t work, it better be good, and this stuff is amazing.  I suggest it to everyone.  It&#x27;s great.  Buy it, its worth every penny, give it time, I saw results within a couple weeks.  They say around 90 days you see your \\&quot;maximum growth\\&quot; or something I dont know or so I read somewhere, but I&#x27;ve been using it a long time and my lashes just get thicker, more numerous, and healthier and fall out less and less. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also my lashes went from falling out a few at a time whenever I removed my stubborn mascara to almost never coming out at all.  Fantastic.  Even when I curl them and abuse them.  This is why they need to be pampered :X&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth every penny!  ^^</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use this everyday, but I use it often, I couldn&#x27;t tell you it works,  So beware, I tried it because of the price. So I don&#x27;t feel a total lose,</li>
    <li> It really has made a difference.  A big difference?  No, but good enough to warrant 5 stars.  I have really short, skimpy eyelashes.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this.  I will buy it again when it starts to get low.  I only use it 1x per day.</li>
    <li> It does a decent job of separating eye lashes, but if I put it on at the base of my lashes as directed, it makes my eyelids itchy.</li>
    <li> This is the best I can&#x27;t believe it worked so well, I so pissed I wasted my money on those other products. This is awesome and it works, for me in the first week. I almost feel I need to buy three more bottles.</li>
    <li> Hogwash! This does absolutely nothing, just had to see for myself.</li>
    <li> This was ok I was hoping that would make my lashes longer and thicker! And well I did make my lashes a lot longer. They didn&#x27;t get any thicker. But it also kind of feels chunky on your eyes if you don&#x27;t wash them every day!</li>
    <li> I started using Loreal lash boosting system and it is the best on the market.  You have to give it time and you will notice improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To quicken things up a got an rx for Latisse...wow it does a nice job but at $100 per bottle I can&#x27;t afford the upkeep.  Once I got my eyelashes to where I was happy I replaced Latisse and continued on using Loreal everyday.  Now I use Latisse only one night  a week and the Loreal  seurm 6x a week.  Now one bottle of Latisse lasts me 6 months.  Using both products makes a difference and saves me $$$$.</li>
    <li> My daughter told me about this product when I mentioned I was going to get the prescription product.  I love this and it really works.  The presecription product is $90 plus per month and this is about $8 per month.  My lashes are finally longer and I actually have lashes to put mascara on.  Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lash boosting serum for about 3 weeks now.  I had tried some individual false lashes and the glue that came with them just would not come off - so I wore chunks of glue at the base of my eyelashes for about TWO MONTHS while waiting for it to &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; off - finally the glue dried up enough and one evening I was taking off my eye makeup with baby oil and the chunks of glue - and the lashes they were attached to - came off.  Trying this serum was my next effort - my lashes did grow back and they do seem (so far) to be a smidge thicker, but not longer.  However I am only a few weeks in so maybe results increase with continued use....still early in my .18 ounce tube!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference, wouldn&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> I have yet to see any growth, but it can&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
    <li> My lashes are growing sooo fast ! This is awesome. I saw results within a month.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful beauty product.  It makes my lashes longer and thicker for less than $10.00 per order.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly worth the money. I use it on my eye lashes and my sparse eye brows. It really works well</li>
    <li> My lashes are a bit longer than before, so it works! I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s sticky texture but for the price it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> This eyelash enhancing (growth I hope) product has a unique split that curves to match the shape of the eyelid. It applies easily and without mess. Hope it makes my eyelashes (and brows) grow.</li>
    <li> This lash booster really does help to make my lashes thicker. It also helps them to stay curled. I have had less lash loss too since I started to use this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the formula i prefer adding castor oil on my lashes</li>
    <li> The package was delivered on time, within a week. But the products look old, like kept in the storage too long and the seal comes off.</li>
    <li> You will start seeing results within 7-8 days of using! Great product! :)</li>
    <li> have been using this for the last 2 years. in order to see a difference in your lashes, you need to consistantly use it once a day. i use it to sleep.</li>
    <li> Before I started wearing fake lashes I had lashes.  But after some time I noticed them getting thinner and thinner then bald in some areas.  I started using this stuff and like magic well not exactly but within a month I noticed they were stronger and longer. I use this once at night before bed and that&#x27;s it.  It does burn a little if you get it in your eyes so be careful. I rarely see my lashes shedding now. This product definitely brought my self confidence back. No more fake stuff for me!</li>
    <li> CAN NOT FIND THIS PRODUCT ANYWHERE CHEAPER. i TAKE THIS OVER THE COUNTER MEDICINE DAILY. I COULD GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR IT BUT WHY IT IS BETTER PRICED HERE</li>
    <li> It seems to be working. Need more time to check it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a month, but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my lashes. I&#x27;m going back to using Rapid Lash because I noticed a difference using that product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 days and tonight when I took off my mascara I noticed that it had stayed on longer and my eyelashes stayed curled longer. Usually I have to re-curl them at some point during the day. Amazing. Of course it&#x27;s too early to notice any growth or thickness, but am very happy so far.</li>
    <li> This is the only lash booster I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;m not even gonna try anything else. I&#x27;ve gotten really great results from this, not only on my lashes, but brows too. I&#x27;ve swiped the wand over sparse areas on my brows, and within a week there is more hair growing there. Seriously, it probably sounds too good to be true, but it&#x27;s not. When I first bought this, my lashes were not short, just average. I wanted the nice fanned out look with long lashes on the sides. I really wish I took a before and after picture. I started following the exact directions for a couple weeks. I saw them growing, but it was very very light, thin tips (I have dark hair). With mascara, they looked longer, but natural, you couldn&#x27;t tell. I started wearing this just without mascara during the day. It makes for a nice natural look if you have dark lashes already. I started seeing the light tips become darker. Some days I would notice too much length on some of my lashes so I didn&#x27;t apply it as often.  I stopped putting it on my lash line after a while because the skin became darker right along my lash line. I do believe this worked faster when you apply to lash line though(so for those impatient ones out there..). So I&#x27;ve now owned 2 bottles of this stuff in the past year and a half. That&#x27;s literally all you need! I&#x27;ve stopped using it as often in the past year or so. I swipe it on every once in a while now, and the long lashes still remain. I also put it on my brows for upkeep. I would say start out following the directions when you first buy it to see maximum results. I would wait at least 2 weeks to a month to see results, and remember to look for the very light tips. Take a before picture (like I didn&#x27;t...) and then you can literally see the after results after a couple months.</li>
    <li> Works good on keeping lashes looking thick without makeup. I use this every day and my lashes look great.  Just a little pricey.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I used to have pretty lame lashes, but after a few weeks, my lashes are definitely nicer than average, and look great with some mascara. I discovered this stuff a few years ago, and any time I stop using it for one reason or another, my lashes return to their natural wimpy state. When I start it up again, I see quick improvements. Yay!</li>
    <li> I just started to use this so it&#x27;s to soon too tell if it&#x27;s working, but today was the first time I noticed a slight difference.</li>
    <li> I love this! So amazing! I will deff repurchase. shipping was quick and the product helps my lashes grow long and thick. I have deff noticed a difference and I will say that I noticed a difference prolly about the 3rd day that I used it. I apply this when I wake up and when I go to bed. if you constantly apply the product though it will bunch and crisp up when dried. just like when applying to much hair spray</li>
    <li> Needed a little boost to regrow my lashes to their normal length after an unfortunate campfire incident. It seems to work great, my lashes are fuller and regrowing quite fast. The applicator is a bit funky, it&#x27;s a spongy felt piece shaped like a mascara wand/brush. Not sure why they couldn&#x27;t just use a real brush, it&#x27;s awkward.</li>
    <li> I am soooooooo in love with this lash boosting serum. Before using this my lashes were barely there....now, only after 3 weeks my lashes are alot fuller and longer, I have also been using it on my lower lashes, they are loving it too. :))&lt;br /&gt;This is an absolute 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Not ready for the big dirt nap yet !&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m trying new things.&lt;br /&gt;Used this just a few days and it&#x27;s working !&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. It works !</li>
    <li> It did not come with any instructions to detail how to apply or the number of applications per day.  There were no warnings as to if it could be used while using eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I havent been using this product for long at all, about a week; and I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I tell you that my best friend and I noticed results within 2 or 3 days after use. This serum does burn a little when some gets into my eyes but not intolerable. I honestly noticed my eyelashes are a little longer not fuller yet. I use this day and night with no mascara at all. You don&#x27;t need alot very little is needed. When I applierd the serum a little too much I noticed white little flakes on my lashes after it dried so only use a little. I can&#x27;t wait until next month I will write another review do far so good for me.</li>
    <li> Weird to use at first but it&#x27;s cheaper to buy it here on amazon than regular stores.</li>
    <li> This works on my lashes.  I only gave it four stars because I hate the wand.  They need a real brush applicator.  I&#x27;m trying other brands just because of this. So as soon as I find one I like, I&#x27;ll stop buying this until they add a wand.  Already tried putting a brush in the bottle.  The neck is so narrow you cant get all the way in.</li>
    <li> I am still going back and forth with the sellers.  They are having trouble understanding how one package out of three ordered arrived open and empty.  I don&#x27;t understand their confusion--the glue that held the blister to the cardboard dried out and the product fell out as someone packed it--or someone kept one and sent 2 thinking no one would complain.  I complained.  I paid for 3 and I expect to get 3!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed to receive this product in its original packaging, but shrink-wrapped on top of that. Upon opening the shrink wrap, I found the original packaging had been opened previously, and presumably the product had been used by someone and returned. Not sanitary to put something used by a stranger so close to one&#x27;s eyes. Immediate return. (Amazon Prime shipping was fast as usual, though. Too bad the contents of the box was sketchy.)</li>
    <li> This is just a stick, not a wand like regular mascara.  It&#x27;s very difficult to apply and gets in your eyes, irritating them.</li>
    <li> I used this and Diva Stuff.  They both are great.  (I used one product on one eye and the other on the other eye as a comparison.  They seem to work pretty much the same.)  I was very skeptical since I have very thin and short lashes, but they sure beat spending a fortune on Latisse, eye lash conditioners or extensions, so I gave them a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  They actually work!  Of course, it takes time-at least a couple of months--but my lashes are definitely and noticeably longer and fuller.  I don&#x27;t know if it will work on everyone, but for the price, it&#x27;s worth a try.  Although I have been using both products for months, I still am on the first container of both, although I have already bought the replacements because I didn&#x27;t want to run out.  It&#x27;s as easy to apply as mascara.</li>
    <li> It really works, whenever my eyelashes start looking thin or frail or falling out when I remove my make up, this is my go to product, I love it, been using it forever</li>
    <li> I hate the applicator brush on this product. It&#x27;s a super curved sponge on a stick and it gets everywhere when you try to apply it lol. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making a difference but I&#x27;ll continue to use it on my eyebrows just to see what happens!</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t working for me, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I&#x27;m not seeing any difference in my lashes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My eyelashes have grown much longer since using it and don&#x27;t fall out as easily. I&#x27;ve always had short lashes, so I am thrilled it works. It is well worth the price and my tube has lasted me several weeks so far.</li>
    <li> I received this with a simple sticker covering it.  It wasn&#x27;t in a plastic package like most mascaras are.  I&#x27;m too afraid to even use this because I don&#x27;t know if it is real.</li>
    <li> this stuff doesn&#x27;t work ,well for me it didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost four months now and i haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
    <li> After about half the tube was gone I started noticing the difference. My lashes were much thicker. I finished the tube and was really impressed. For some stupid reason I decided to order another lash enhancer. I hated it. I had also tried a different one before I tried this but did not see real results. Not only does this work great it also has other things I loved. The things I loved about this product over others are one of a kind. I love the applicator. It makes it easy to get it where it needs to go without having to stick yourself in the eye. It also allows the right amount so there is no over application problems. This stuff is not a liquid it&#x27;s a gel so it stays where you put it. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes either. I highly recommend it to anyone with thin eyelashes that wants them to be fuller and long in just a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Another dis-continued awesome product.. Why Loreal???</li>
    <li> This was going to be a surprise gift but the package was broken and looks like it was very manipulated, I think i would buy another brand this time.</li>
    <li> It took a couple of months to see the results after using this product on a nightly basis.  But it&#x27;s working great and my lashes are healthier and thicker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product for a little over 3 weeks. My eyelashes seen a little thicker. It could be my imagination but they look a whole lot thicker and longer after I put mascara.</li>
    <li> It worked for me! Visible results in 2 days of continuous use. But just don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!!  I was buying it as an eyelash primer, but it is more like a serum...and it totally doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for three months twice a day and it did nothing to me. My lashes are still falling out when I remove eye makeup. It neither strengthen nor lengthen my lashes. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I tried this for one month. My eyelashes grew more but they were uneven and I had lashes missing and this product did not help them to grow. It is sticky and I could not apply my mascara after putting it on, even though the instructions stated that I could. I will not purchase again. I prefer Double Lash which fills in my lashes and keeps them from falling out.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice, with a gap of 2 years. I can see the effects almost immediately; within 2-3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any side effects or redness. It is important to replace them every 2 months or so if used daily. Just make sure not to over do it.</li>
    <li> I guess I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to be able to tell if it really works or not yet, but I think it is. One thing I don&#x27;t like it that it seems to build up on my lashes, which probably isn&#x27;t a good thing. When I wash my face in the morning (I put it on at night) I feel it coming off. Not sure about it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t leave without it.  I wear it every day.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much good one nice to work with helpful cooperative good material I like it I appreciate it</li>
    <li> I started using this product about a month ago when some of my lashes had practically disappeared. I have used it every morning and suddenly I have thicker and longer lashes than every before and I no longer need to curl them. I have a thyroid disorder that makes me lose lashes every now and then, this product has solved that problem completely. A little note, do not use waterproof mascara since it tends to make lashes fall out and become brittle and break.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!  I noticed a difference right away, and I am going to order more ASAP!  It instantly made my lashes longer and thicker, and I use it twice a day on clean lashes - before I got to bed (after washing off my makeup) and when I get out of the shower in the morning.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I Didn&#x27;t use it daily but it help my weak eyelashes to look better healther</li>
    <li> Really does work but takes longer than 2 days I think I been using for a week or more and I had some tiny ll eyelashes on the outer corner of my eye that would not grow and every time I blinked the lash would stab my lower lid still not fully grown out but getting there....</li>
    <li> Great price, same product that&#x27;s in the store &amp; cheaper.  Don&#x27;t give up w/ this product :  keep using it &amp; in a month-to-six weeks, your lashes WILL be longer &amp; thicker.  I used it on my sparse eyebrow, too, &amp; got results</li>
    <li> I am 44 yrs. old and I have always had great eyelashes, but one day they were all of a sudden shorter.  Noticed my eyebrows had thinned out, too.  Maybe age or perimenopausal--not sure why.  After accidentally coming across this product and reading through the reviews, I purchased this and am so glad I did--certainly a bonus w/the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviewers mentioned how she uses this as a base coat for her mascara.  I tried this and love it!  It doesn&#x27;t make your mascara clump, actually makes it easier to apply mascara and I don&#x27;t need a second coat now; nor do I have to go back w/a an eyelash comb to separate or correct the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I use it:  I pull the wand out and then dip the applicator head back in just a bit and pull it out making sure I get about half the product off.  Yes, the wand applicator is a bit weird until you figure how to use it for what works for you.  Then I place the wand at the very base of my lashes and stroke upward--ensuring I cover the lashes from base to tip.  Then I use the inside tip of the applicator for the very outer and inner lashes.  Then I use the back of the applicator for the lower lashes--the same process for them, too.  I let dry for a few seconds and then apply my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara that I use, and love!, is \\&quot;Maybelline Classic Volume Express\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have too much product on the wand--it does irritate my eyes for a bit, but nothing too bad.  Just means I had too much product on the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t incorporated it yet into my nightly cleaning routine, but will soon.  One of the reviewers mentioned that it made her eye lashes too long, if that happens--then I will cut out the second daily application.</li>
    <li> I had used about 2 months for every night but it did not change anything.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed at this item.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eyelash growth products.  This product made my eyelashes grow a little bit longer, but not thicker.  It had no effect on my eyebrows.  The applicator is little difficult to use, but not much after you get used to it.  The product does burn a little if you get it in your eyes.</li>
    <li> Doesnt work for lashes, but helped grow my brows. I&#x27;ve used this for about 6 weeks and while it does nothing for my lashes, its helps my brows grow :-/</li>
    <li> I used this for one eyebrow which had a spot that needed filling in from over plucking, and the brow hairs weren&#x27;t growing back after several months. Just a couple of days after I started using this, I noticed new hairs, growling into the spot.  I&#x27;m surprised it works so quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week, the spot was 100% filled in. The hairs are still a bit short but this isn&#x27;t noticeable, and they get longer each day. And my brows look completely filled in now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really need this on my eyelashes but I imagine it would work well on the lashes also. Excellent container; the product is well packaged and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once (because i just got it in the mail today), and i can feel my eyelashes silken up. I wear alot of mascara daily and with this i can help my eyelashes not just grow but keep them moisturized and healthy.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it lengthened my lashes considerably. It doesn&#x27;t thicken it but I do notice a good lengthening in my lashes. I wish it would make it darker and thicker but I just use a good mascara and that does the trick. My eyes look a lot better with this with a good mascara. Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my eyebrows though but I like it well enough to order another one after the 1st tube ran out. I experimented and stopped using it for a week or so and I can see my lashes got shorter again. Just be careful not to get some product in your eyes coz it makes my vision foggy so I keep blinking it out.</li>
    <li> I used it for a few times...it stings the eyelids just a little for a second.  It doesn&#x27;t feel moisturizing for my lid or lashes.  Maybe I&#x27;ll use it on my eyebrows...  I don&#x27;t know how well it works since I&#x27;ve only used it a few times...</li>
    <li> I think it works.  I used Lattisse for a while and that was too expensive.  This is very good and for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;dm</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for a month now, morning and night faithly, and I see no visible signs of length or growth.  I give it 2 stars only because I haven&#x27;t seen many eyelashes on my pad when I take off my mascara so MAYBE there is some signs of strengthening?</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t work at all even after months of use.</li>
    <li> Mine was not in a package, the product was just rolling around in the box.  Really??? Who would buy a product that goes on your eyes that isn&#x27;t properly packaged??  Returning it - just because I have no idea if it&#x27;s contaminated or not!!</li>
    <li> My eye doctor ripped half of my eyelashes on one eye so I decided to boost their growth. I am pleased to say that after two weeks of use my lashes are almost 100% back!! Will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I apply it after I curl my lashes, and I feel it really helps in making them &amp;#34;Look&amp;#34; longer. but as far as actual growth to my own lashes I&#x27;ll have to say it didn&#x27;t work in that aspect. The product is a thick liquid that covers the lash and some of the gel at the ends of the lash adhere to itself and hang off the lash a bit, giving the apperance of more length, but only after applying mascara afterwards do u notice any difference. This product alone doesn&#x27;t make your lashes look longer. No, it&#x27;s not a miracle grow ur lashes longer serum, but I like it because helps bring out my eyes more than mascara alone would.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps</li>
    <li> I used this religiously for 8 weeks. Unfortunately, I saw no difference in my lashes.  The application was very easy to use.</li>
    <li> For the price of this product it is absolutely unbeatable. It works... REALLY WORKS! I got fake eyelashes done, (terrible idea) After they all came out taking most of my real lashes with them, I bought this and after 1 week I could tell a solid noticeable difference. It has been two weeks now and they look fuller than before the fake lashes, :-)</li>
    <li> Waste of money- used 2x daily for  a month.  NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. It can be irritating too. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the right product out there but I was told by a friend that this should work. Nope. I applied it religiously and no difference seen.</li>
    <li> i apply this on top-bottom parts of lashes, and it works. my lashes are much longer than prior to using. i couple this with another product, and my eyelashes look great! easy to use and just apply before you go to sleep. it does not thicken the lashes, but only lengthens for mine, but i&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my eyelashes pop! Evertime before I put mascara on I put this product on and it makes my lashes looks fuller!</li>
    <li> I use this with my masara. I do not have an abundance of lashes nor are my lashes long and gorgeous. Using this boosting serum helps my mascara stay put and wonderfully accent my hazel eyes.</li>
    <li> It really coats your lashes. I see the length has improved but as for volume nothing.</li>
    <li> This works if you use it religiously. My bottom lashes are thicker. I&#x27;ve beeb using this for a couple months. Too much burns your eyes but i can definitely tell a difference.</li>
    <li> Really saw difference in a couple of days! Amazing! My eyelashes really look longer already. Pretty incredible. Just wish it was less annoying to put it on</li>
    <li> I put this on every now and then and I can see a difference! Helps with volume and length.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes have gotten longer since I&#x27;ve started using this 2 weeks ago!  fast shipping!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, but better than nothing and cannot beat the price</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much to increase length and volume of the lashes.</li>
    <li> I saw zero lash enhancement to my lashes.</li>
    <li> This product is so great! My lashes really respond to it fast. I just put it on after I take my makeup off at night. Dries fast. My lashes start thickening up quickly. They appear  full and long. I was going to do Latisse, and  asked about it at the dermatologists office. Found this and thought I would give it a try. On my next visit to the dermatologist, the aesthetician asked me why my lashes were so long and full. She asked if I got the Latisse. I told her I was using this. The look on her face said it all :)  If you don&#x27;t have a lot of I lashes, it probably won&#x27;t make you suddenly grow lashes where you had none, but it seems to promote thickness, so give it a try. Mine weren&#x27;t really thick, but they look it now. I notice a difference if I stop using it.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works and you cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> No length or thickness difference in my lashes after 6 months of use. Maybe it conditioned them but I couldn&#x27;t tell. My lashes didn&#x27;t fall out so therefore a mediocre rating.</li>
    <li> I love this product it makes my eyelashes stronger, longer and fuller since it prevent them from falling off</li>
</ol>
