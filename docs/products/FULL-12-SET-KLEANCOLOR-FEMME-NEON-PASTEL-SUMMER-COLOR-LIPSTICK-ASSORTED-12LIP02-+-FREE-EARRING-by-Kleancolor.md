### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>All the colors show up perfect on my lips</li>
      <li>My daughter loves the bright colors.  </li>
      <li>Love them a lil bright but great on my skin</li>
      <li>The colors are great, some definitely better than others.</li>
      <li>some colors are great and very opaque, while others aren&#x27;t that good.</li>
      <li>so they&#x27;re okay for that.</li>
      <li>For the price, they work, and are cute colors.</li>
      <li>as much anyone considering this product will be most pleased :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll take photos but, everything came fine.</li>
      <li>Also, the free gift earring was not included with my purchase.</li>
      <li>the colors are very pigmented and they smell delicious as well each one different.</li>
      <li>Grear colors but no earrings... wasn&#x27;t excited about the earring anyway</li>
      <li>but the lipstick tubes are so pretty even better</li>
      <li>This is the most amazing color lipstick I have ever used or seen not only that</li>
      <li>I love the colors and it kinda acts like a lip stain I don&#x27;t really have to reapply</li>
      <li>But lots of cool colors.</li>
      <li>The shipping was right on time from when they said.</li>
      <li>Real creamy nice neon colors.long lasting.</li>
      <li>Stays on very well!</li>
      <li>They were not expensive for 12 lip shades, so you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I most likely will not but again.</li>
      <li>The colors for me all work good except the light pink, light blue, medium blue and lime yellow green but the others look great.</li>
      <li>The free earring wasn&#x27;t in the package and the light green color was broken.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t really stick on too well</li>
      <li>I was again too high expectations.</li>
      <li>The orange goes on easily and is actually very smooth, same with the pinks and purples, the yellow is very see through and if your lips aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth, it would cake up on them as with a few other colors in this bundle.</li>
      <li>then the pictures its so vibrant exotic and unbelievable</li>
      <li>light and smelled slightly.</li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t work under black light.</li>
      <li>very translucent, and several layers is needed to get the desired color for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The other colors are pretty and vibrant.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not like the cheap crud you usually get</li>
      <li>I like the colors of the lipsticks, but they are thin &amp; will need to be applied often as they easily smear off.</li>

    <li> All the colors show up perfect on my lips</li>
    <li> some colors are great and very opaque, while others aren&#x27;t that good. The orange goes on easily and is actually very smooth, same with the pinks and purples, the yellow is very see through and if your lips aren&#x27;t perfectly smooth, it would cake up on them as with a few other colors in this bundle. None of them can compare to the NYX neon colors, though. For the price, they work, and are cute colors.</li>
    <li> Love them a lil bright but great on my skin</li>
    <li> The colors for me all work good except the light pink, light blue, medium blue and lime yellow green but the others look great. They don&#x27;t really stick on too well so I wouldn&#x27;t wear them out in public however I got them to take pictures in for my page so they&#x27;re okay for that.</li>
    <li> The colors are great, some definitely better than others. I bought these for festival season. very translucent, and several layers is needed to get the desired color for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were wanting these for everyday use, I would spend the money for a nicer brand, but they did the job.</li>
    <li> Grear colors but no earrings... wasn&#x27;t excited about the earring anyway but if it&#x27;s advertised then it should be in the package.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll take photos but, everything came fine. I got all the colors as seen. The only thing that&#x27;s a little weird is the how moist this lipstick is and it comes off a tiny bit but not without a fight.</li>
    <li> They where broken and the seals where also broke. Never buy them again.</li>
    <li> light and smelled slightly.</li>
    <li> I received them on time, but 3 sticks were broken, I had to fix, so I could use them, and no &amp;#34;free earrings&amp;#34; were given. I most likely will not but again. I do like all the colors, but for the conditions I got some in and what I paid, kinda disappointed.</li>

Also, the free gift earring was not included with my purchase. Tried contacting the seller about it, and got no response.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the bright colors.  Stays on very well!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing color lipstick I have ever used or seen not only that but the lipstick tubes are so pretty even better then the pictures its so vibrant exotic and unbelievable I couldn&#x27;t stop testing each color and it&#x27;s not like the cheap crud you usually get</li>
    <li> Basic stuff. I was again too high expectations.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t work under black light. But lots of cool colors.</li>
