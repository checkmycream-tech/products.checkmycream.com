<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The tweezers are great, but they were extremely over packaged in plastic that cannot be recycled.</li>
    <li> These were amazing. I&#x27;ve heard of this brand for years now but was skeptical. My old tweezers just do not get the job done anymore but these definitely do. Gotta be careful, though, one wrong tug and you might take out more than you expected!</li>
    <li> These are hands down the best tweezers I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> For years, I&#x27;ve bought basic, drugstore tweezers.  I&#x27;ve even filed down flush their gripping surfaces when they didn&#x27;t work so well.  Now I feel stupid for being so cheap.  The difference is tremendous.  Unlike drugstore tweezers, these are firm-- they don&#x27;t flex between your fingers when you are gripping.  The actual metal is thicker and stronger, so it doesn&#x27;t feel like the tweezer handles are bending flat when you squeeze them together.  The result is a really sound pinch.  It can easily fasten on the shortest, stubborn hairs.  The tips are sharp and strong.  I didn&#x27;t know how bad my old tweezers were until now.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers on the market!</li>
    <li> Tweezerman are the best, sharpest tweezers on the market. The green color was on sale, I and actually ended up liking the color because they are easy to spot in my drawer.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, and the bright green color makes them easy to find. So I am very happy with this puchase.</li>
    <li> They work great but would not say they are worth the money. The edge is cut precise and meets up great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  Other tweezers cannot get the tiny hairs -- this one is very sturdy and the tips are very strong to grasp the little hairs.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers for any hairs, eyebrows and chin hairs! A little long because my hands are small going to try the mini ones next.</li>
    <li> The slanted Tweezerman has always been the state-of-the-art tweezer, and I&#x27;ve bought a few @ $22.00, and lost a few as well. When Amazon had the bright green on sale for $7.00, it was a great deal AND very hard to lose!</li>
    <li> Tweezerman slant tweezer is hands down the best tweezer ever!!! I have one at home and one in my purse. What&#x27;s so great about it? Takes out hair clean and easy to get those pesky short eyebrow hairs! Worth every penny!! I use it inbetween waxing at the salon.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect tweezers! They are a great color, and they miss nothing. I have purchased many, many brands of tweezers but I am 100% sold on tweezerman.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think that there could be that much difference in tweezers, and honestly I bought these because of the color, and felt a little silly spending more just because they matched my bath towels. I was pleasantly surprised to see that I not only had an adorable pair of green tweezers, but that they worked better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. They are fantastic! They grab little skinny hairs so much better, and pull them out, root and all, every time on the first try! You can even grab a bunch of those fine little hairs at once. I almost plucked out all my eyebrows the afternoon they came, I was so delighted. Well worth the money Tweezerman. My now super thin eyebrows thank you.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work great and this color is hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> There is a reason why they call this the no.1 tweezer...it is indeed the best. I was fairly reluctant to spend $18 on a pair of tweezers, but now that have actually used it, I think it was a worthwhile purchase. Also I don&#x27;t know if its just me, but tweezing was relatively less painful when I used these.This review is after my 1 time use so I cannot comment on its longevity!   If you are in market for a good tweezer, I&#x27;d say definitely try these, you will be sold in the first pluck :)</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s really no comparison between these and &amp;#34;grocery store&amp;#34; tweezers.  They work amazingly well.  Great gift idea for someone who &amp;#34;has everything.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> And they will not pull a single hair. I did not drop them or do anything to cause the alignment to be off! I&#x27;ve had 3 other pairs of Tweezermans and the same thing has happened with each pair. They work great but only for a short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I sent these back and they returned very functional so I updated my review :)</li>
    <li> They work like the first (they were great). Although the first pair I bought came in a cool hard plastic case, and these ones came in flimsier plastic package. I liked the old package better because I could store them in there, too bad I threw it away. :(</li>
    <li> I have used all kinds of tweezers in the past, some with scissor-like construction, some collapsible to put in your purse, etc. This is like an old-fashioned tweezer from the 50&#x27;s, but even sharper. No more taking 4 or 5 tries to get one little eyebrow hair. This instrument works the first time, every time. I just bought one for my Mom and sister.</li>
    <li> This comes in very handy, especially when removing ticks from my kids. Its also very good for removing ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my boyfriend because he kept stealing mine. He is pleased and they work perfectly. These are our second pair of tweezerman, and they have lasted a while and stay sharp.</li>
    <li> Excellent, most precise tweezers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter recommended these as the best tweezers out there and they truly are!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome - way better than any drugstore tweezers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  They grip my fine hairs and it is less painful to pluck them out!  I am very happy with them!</li>
    <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned.  Best for getting out splinters &amp; the like.  Great quality product.</li>
    <li> These tweezers work very well at gripping the little hairs before you&#x27;re ready to pluck.  The size is pretty good, any bigger and they might just be too big.  They are sharp and pointy so you can grab what you&#x27;re trying to grab for those detail plucks.  The green is a nice touch, making them easier to find and remind me of sour apple.  Delicious!</li>
    <li> These are fantastic tweezers . . . I never knew that tweezers could even be this good! I guess buying cheap drugstore tweezers in the past lead me to have very low expectations.  These are very much worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my backpacking medical kit. They have a super-fine tip that will grab just about anything you can see with your naked eye. I would certainly recommend these.</li>
    <li> These are really great tweezers!  They work well even for little tiny hairs.  I also love the color, super fun.</li>
    <li> I find these to work well. Comfortable in the hand. Clean tight tip. Recommended</li>
    <li> This tweezers is everything I had hoped for in such a tool.  Very good at getting small things and has great gripping power</li>
    <li> Great tweezers for man-scaping. Yes I said it, man-scaping. The tweezer company had to have men in mind to call it Tweezer-man right? Either that or I&#x27;m just lying to myself to feel better about using these. Regardless! I like using them.</li>
    <li> I had to replace a 10+ year old pair of tweezers that finally fell apart at the weld. I bought a pair of mid-range priced drug store tweezers, and they did not do the job at all. When I got these I had high hopes for the quality, but they don&#x27;t work as well as my old ones. I have to grab the hair 3-4 and even 5 times before I can grasp it and pull it out.</li>
    <li> Good but not great....one day I hope to fine Great tweezer for now these will have to do....Tweezerman Slant Tweezer, Green Apple....I do like the cool color!~</li>
    <li> Love these!  The angled tip is amazing!</li>
    <li> They work so much better than the drugstore variety. I&#x27;d love to buy a few more pairs, I&#x27;m always losing mine!</li>
    <li> You have to love tweeze an tweezers. This is my second pair and I love them. I also have the pointed tip. The metal is sturdy and the alignment is correct.  I have tried cheaper tweezers, only to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers!  I put off buying these because of the brand price, but am very glad now that I have them, wow!  Very precise tips that work wonders on tiny hairs that you can barely see.  I&#x27;ve tossed all my other tweezers, these are IT.</li>
    <li> Awesome pair of tweezers. Very small and get the job done.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to find a top quality tweezer, these are it. This is my first Tweezerman tweezer and I am extremely pleased with its performance. It works far better than any other tweezer I have owned. The range of colors offered also make it fun. It has a small plastic protective tube that covers the tips, but for that price I&#x27;d prefer it came in a tube. Regardless, I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on any other brand of tweezer. I spent my whole life getting cheapy tweezers from drug stores. Finally, since I buy everything else on Amazon I decided to spend more than 5 dollars. WORTH IT. Very good, just imagine getting every hair you every try to get the first time! Done and done. Get them.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd one, the first one bent the blades with just one drop on the bathroom tile.</li>
    <li> I have had Tweezermans before and have never had a problem with them, but they really just don&#x27;t grip well. I don;t know if these are a bit of a one-off or reject, but I am not sure I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> The Tweezerman Slant Tweezer is a precision instrument.  Expensive, but a world of difference from the run of the mill tweezers you see at the drugstore.  Be careful, the blades are pointy and sharp.  It comes with a plastic cap that protects the blades when not in use.  The lime green color makes it easy to find among your bathroom stuff.  An excellent, well-made product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost too sharp-- if I grip the hair tightly, it sometimes breaks at the point at which I grabbed it.  Great for fine hair and for ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman makes the best tweezers. Top quality. Worth the money. The handles are coated with a non slip spongy rubberized coating which is very nice.</li>
    <li> Item was as described and very nice.</li>
    <li> Great pair of tweezers. The angle makes them very easy to tweeze brows. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Gave these to my sister. She said they were the best tweezers she ever had. Of course, she has been getting low end tweezers--but still a good review.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about Tweezerman Tweezers.  I don&#x27;t know what I did before them. These are the best tweezers out there.  Do not hesitate to order them.  I love the slant tweezers.</li>
    <li> NOT to Teezerman quality. Does not pinch together evenly</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t spend much time plucking because these tweezers get hairs the first time!  I wish I would have purchased these years ago.</li>
    <li> I purchased these in the green apple for under $15 with free S&amp;H . These are so worth every penny . I received them quickly and tried them immediately on stubborn chin hair and to touch up my brows. These do a great job, are very easy to handle , and super sharp (so be careful) I love that they have a free lifetime sharpening guarantee , they came very well and safely packaged . I also love the green color (so easy to find in my cosmetic bag. Needless to say I came back to the same vendor and for under $10 with free shipping bought the mini version in stainless to keep in my purse. I also immediately tossed out those cheap drugstore tweezers which are useless. Treat yourself for these. Would also make great gift item for women or men in your life.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a tweezer for stubborn eyebrow &amp; dreaded chin hairs that works.  Over the years,  must have purchased dozens that didn&#x27;t  get the job done, until finding tweezerman reviews on Amazon.  They were so great, I figured I&#x27;d finally found the right tweezer.  They do work better than others, but the slanted tip occasionally pinches my skin and I still have problems grabbing small hairs.  They are the sharpest tweezers I ever owned, but I think I will try the straight edge &amp; see if they work better.</li>
    <li> Best twwwzers. Can tweez the tiniest hairs. I&#x27;ve had another pair for over a year. Bought this one in case I lose the first pair. Worth the extra money. You save in not buying multiply cheap tweezers.</li>
    <li> I kept putting off buying these because they were so expensive, but I&#x27;m glad I finally did it. These are definitely the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Good tweezers makes all the difference and these are good tweezers.  Not cheap, but a good investment.</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend and she liked it so well that she bought 2 more for her granddaughters.</li>
    <li> these tweezers are super well made and excellently do the job.  the slant is great and i find plucking and shaping so much easier with these than other tweezers&amp;#34;  dont be put off by the price.  tweezermans retail for 22 dollars usually so this is a good deal.  and they ever get dull, tweezerman will sharpen or replace them free (you pay shipping is all).  totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I should have sprung for these tweezers a long time ago!  The tips are so sharp it can probably cut through my eyebrow hair.  Grips hair nicely and yanks it out with little effort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tweezers, and this is the best one out there. It easily grips hair, no matter what length, and it&#x27;s great on the hard to get ones. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it&#x27;s definitely worth the price because it actually works.</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove some chin hair and keep my eyebrows clean between routine threading appointments. I tried this on my chin hair and the hair came out with literally no effort and didn&#x27;t even hurt as much as a pinch. The product feels very solid in the hand and the slanted surface makes it easy to grab hairs without poking yourself. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Always the best quality</li>
    <li> These tweezers are so much better than the cheap ones I bought at the grocery store! The edge is very sharp, so they are not a toy in any way, but for eyebrows they are the best.</li>
    <li> This tweezer works really well. You just have to make sure not to lose the cap that goes over it otherwise it will dull very quickly.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are the best I ever bought. Very sharp and precise and I love the lime green color so I can find it easily.</li>
    <li> The reviews I read at Amazon.com made me select this -- it is without fault. I use it all the time - makes tweezing precisely easy.</li>
    <li> Not as good as an avon tweezer I used to have, which I lost. This feels loose and unstable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a couple months and they are amazing. I have similar tweezers that were in the $10 range and these are just much, much better. I am able to tweeze hairs that are very short. They&#x27;re fairly new so I haven&#x27;t taken advantage of the sharpening that is offered.</li>
    <li> I could have bought a cheaper tweezer and gotten better results. It&#x27;s not a bad tweezer, just thought it is not worth the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Its the best out there.... Nothing else to say.....</li>
    <li> These have got to be the best tweezers on the market.</li>
    <li> Definitely great and lives up to its brand name.  Sometimes it&#x27;s almost too sharp and actually cuts hairs that I&#x27;m plucking.  That sometimes makes it even harder to pluck.  But other than that, this works great for me.</li>
    <li> Not much else to say other than that, i got it very fast, it works extremely well, and I appreciate it very much</li>
    <li> No joke, man. You want your hairs tweezed? This thing&#x27;s got your back. Got a pimple you need squeezed? No prob, brah. Ingrown hair? Just point it in the right direction, and things are gonna get did.</li>
    <li> When this first arrived in the mail, I tried it and was really skeptical. These tweezers are a a little bit better than the Revlon tweezers for tiny small unnoticeable hairs ONLY but these tweezers will still snap hair UNLIKE the Revlon tweezers. These tweezers can pinch skin, so I would beware of the grip of these tweezers as these are sharp around the edge. They have a great slant tip compared to the pointy ones. These are good but NO tweezers are perfect. I wished these tweezers were a little bit thicker then I would of given it 5 stars. The hair will likely snap with these tweezers because these tweezers aren&#x27;t thick enough. I use these to pull out mustache and unwanted chin beards. I use these tweezers in addition to the Revlon tweezers. These tweezers are still worth every penny and I recommend these tweezers to anyone I know. They are great but definitely NOT excellent. These will definitely pull small fine hairs and even little tiny hairs you can&#x27;t see with the naked eye most tweezers can&#x27;t. What can I say? At least they do the job well.</li>
    <li> Works great. Best tweezers ever.</li>
    <li> I have bought many tweezers in my day but I can honestly say this is the finest instrument I have ever purchased.  I have light hair and am older so my eyesight is not as keen as it was but tweezerman  picks up the finest hairs and the smallest lengths and get them first time every time.  I have never been possessive about a tweezer before but this is the first one I won&#x27;t loose.</li>
    <li> These are Tweezerman tweezers... the best there is. Why are you reading this? Buy them already.</li>
    <li> Bought them for my Fiance but I use them as much as she does! They grab on to everything! Ingrown hairs, splinters you name it. The are truly a precision instrument. No one should be without these tweezers!</li>
    <li> I have not used this yet, but it is highly recommended by everyone who uses it.  I needed a new one and bought this but have not tried it yet.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers -- these are to replace a smaller one I can&#x27;t find anywhere.  I got bright green so I wouldn&#x27;t lose them (again). They are a bit pricey but worth it, since what good on earth are tweezers that don&#x27;t work!  These DO!  Toss all your other tweezers in the trash, or make a metal sculpture with them.  They aren&#x27;t worth your time.  Finally -- tweezers that I can count on!</li>
    <li> $15 - $20 for a tweezer??? Really?!?!? These were my initial thoughts when I looked for a new tweezer. Then I talked to my wife and asked her for an opinion on what you should be paying for a good quality tweezer. In her wisdom, she indicated that the price Amazon wanted was not out of range. Reluctantly, I took the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok - now I am a believer. This little tool grabs hair unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever experienced, proving you really do get what you pay for. No slips on grabbing stubborn hairs, at least what I perceived as stubborn based on previous tweezers I&#x27;ve had. Nothing slips out of this thing. These things are significantly different than your average $4 drugstore tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a happy purchaser, even though I was quite reluctant to spend this kind of money on tweezers. I&#x27;m converted!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  The tweezers do not grab and hold hairs well and you have to try a couple to a few times to remove.  I was replacing a cheaper pair of tweezers that worked pretty well and thought that these would be even better.  especially considering the much higher price.  I have gone back to using my old ones until I buy another.  :((</li>
    <li> Love my tweezers they work great!</li>
    <li> I love that it is sharp but sometimes it does hurt because it is so sharp.  Overall, i&#x27;m happy with this product and its cheery apple green color.  I also like the container it came in and the rubber protector on the end (because it&#x27;s so sharp).</li>
    <li> These are the best brand tweezers that I have tried. However, be careful not to drop them. One hairline dent will ruin them. I have tried to send them back to Tweezerman for their free sharpening program. the first time, 3 pairs got lost in the mail. that was an expensive loss. the second time, they just rejected them because they said it was consumer damage.</li>
    <li> not as sharp as other tweezerman tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased. Maybe these are just a lemon, or maybe knock-offs</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers and you can never have too many!</li>
    <li> I could not understand why everyone was so excited about a pair of tweezers.  But when I lost the pair I had, I thought maybe I should invest in something nicer since I was never really happy with the cheaper ones.  Now I&#x27;m a convert.  These tweezers are as awesome as tweezers can be.  It&#x27;s easy to get exactly the hair I&#x27;m after (no missing it, or grabbing the hair I&#x27;m after plus a few surrounding ones by accident), and have no trouble getting fine hairs that other tweezers couldn&#x27;t grab.  So glad I gave them a shot.  I&#x27;ve had them for over a year now and am still very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> the best tweezers out there! this is my second one and they always live up to the name</li>
    <li> Just as I expected and was super-close to the shade shown!  I love Tweezerman products and lost an old pair so I was very happy with the cute, sharp pair that I received.</li>
    <li> for wife...she likes it</li>
    <li> Received product quickly. Awesome tweezers! The last pair I had lasted 10 years.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman&#x27;s are my favorite tweezers and I won&#x27;t ever purchase any others.</li>
    <li> this is nice.  I really like the bright green color bc i&#x27;m forever losing stuff and at least this color helps me find it.  And find it I must bc i use this thing everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i had a tweezerman before but somehow the tip got smushed - (i blame the kids- they deny it - but i know they are lying)&lt;br /&gt;so bought this - OHHHHH Yeah!!  a new tweezer is different from old tweezer.  even with careful use its not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this thing plucked hairs i didn&#x27;t even know it was there.  what a difference.  I heard that tweezerman will sharpen it for you if you send it out to them.  I might just do that bc it works so much better when it is sharpened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it everyday now for a couple of month.  its still AMOOOOZING but its not as exact as the first week i got it.  but that is expected.  love this thing!!</li>
    <li> finally invested in quality tweezer tool.  Worth every penny.  I tweeze just about daily.  These are excellent.  Would work well for splinters and other fine removal, having both a sharp point and flat edge.  Nice to hold with the colored covering.</li>
    <li> Never though I would be reviewing a set of tweezers!  These things are unbelievable, they pull even the finest of hairs with ease.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted tweezers from Tweezerman but thought they were a little high in cost but I bit the bullet anyway and glad I did.  They work great.</li>
    <li> Love tweezerman. we definitely take advantage of their free sharpening, just know that at some point &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; turns into $5 because they have to manually sharpen them, then it reaches a point where you are better off getting a new pair. This is our 3rd pair, other 2 still work (and are prob 3-5 yrs old), just don&#x27;t stay sharp long enough to get the pesky short hairs.  Worth the investment!</li>
    <li> My slant-tip Revlon tweezers broke, and I had heard great things about these tweezers, so I figured I&#x27;d try them even though they were twice what I wanted to pay. They work well, but not well enough to justify the price. My Revlon ones were half the price and worked exactly the same. Oh well, at least they&#x27;re a neat color!</li>
    <li> These are tweezers have an awesome grip.  The slanted end along with the sturdy constructions allows you to grip and remove hair in all unwanted locations.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good, but not worth nearly $20. They don&#x27;t work much better than my $4 Revlon drugstore tweezers. The tiny hairs that some people say they can get with these? Not so much for me.</li>
    <li> I hate this tweezers they do not pulled the hair and on top it braes the hair....Too much money and it wasn&#x27;t worth it I could have gone to Walgreens  but tought  since amazon sells it it s better,,,,NO I am not happy with it !</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. What more do you need? Better than the cheap ones you find at WalMart, price is good considering the quality.</li>
    <li> I have had several pars of tweezerman tweezers. They are wonderful. I am convinced this particular company is selling fake or fraudulent tweezers because this product is not the same and does not grab small hairs at all. I am disappointed and will buy this product somewhere else in the future.</li>
    <li> NOT the be all and end all it is supposed to be, but a GOOD tweezer.  Not GREAT, but Pretty Good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other brand of tweezer. I have really unruly, curly eyebrows and this works great, even for ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> For 45 years I&#x27;ve had a hair on my chin that no tweezer has been able to pull out. I read the reviews on this tweezer and decided to try one more time. Oh my gosh! I am shocked! This tweezer is fantastic! It pulled out that darn hair on my chin on the very first try (and my eyesight isn&#x27;t the best). I&#x27;m so happy with this jewel that I&#x27;m hiding them from my husband. Thank you Tweezerman and thank you Amazon. I would&#x27;ve never known about these if it hadn&#x27;t been for your website. Signed, Hairless.</li>
    <li> These seem to be high quality and they work very well. They made me realize how bad my old tweezers had become. These grab every hair.</li>
    <li> I received these tweezers for Christmas and finally got the chance to use them today. While I&#x27;ve only used them once so far, I was happy with their functionality and they seemed to be easier to use than other tweezers I&#x27;ve had in the past. I was able to do a far better job at getting the really short hairs on my eyebrows. Overall, so far very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really spaced out my threading appointments with this! I would definitely recommend it for people who know what they&#x27;re doing and not alike</li>
    <li> Tweezerman makes some awesome tweezers for sure.  Easy to handle and grabs even the finest of peach fuzz easily.  Somehow my previous tweezerman tweezer got put in a pants pocket and went through the washing machine.  Don&#x27;t ask.  Who knows.  Anyway, it&#x27;s not recommended.  After that they had difficulty grabbing even a thicker eyebrow hair so I had to replace.  The point being that these are fabulous enough that I was willing to shell out over $20 for tweezers...TWICE.</li>
    <li> These tweezers easily grab stray eyebrow hairs with minimal pain. The tweezers are also sharp enough to remove ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> These tweezers truly have the grip of a man.  A bit sharp on the edge but these are some of the better tweezers I&#x27;ve ever manscaped with and attack in-grown hairs like a rebel without a cause.  Be careful though as the grip on these will quickly pull out a few more hairs than you wanted.  I still have trouble justifying spending 20$ on a pair of tweezers, but these are built tough and should last a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tweezerman Stant Tweezers for many years. I would not have bought another pair if I had not lost my original pair. The ends stay sharp and can grab the tiniest of hairs. Tweezerman will sharpen the blades for you if you feel they become too dull. I will never buy another pair of tweezers.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different tweezers and find these to be the best. They are easy to hold and are very accurate. Even our son uses them!</li>
    <li> They work extremely well - you don&#x27;t know the difference between precision tweezers and the kind sold cheaply at drug/department stores until you use the good kind.  They you won&#x27;t go back.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these to travel with - the bright color helps me keep track of them.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is to be careful that they don&#x27;t just snip the eyebrow hair off, instead of pulling it.</li>
    <li> I use these bad boys for my eyebrows. I&#x27;m a male with some thick brows. These babies make short work of plucking and defining them. I actually have to be careful not to overdue it. Don&#x27;t even read another review or look at another pair. Choose your color and I promise you will be satisfied. Hell it&#x27;s a pair of tweezers. And these are the best ones on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers. Used for eyebrows they work fantastically well. They have replaced our old faithful tweezers that were losing their edge. They may lack a little grip strength due to their design, but they catch the tiniest hairs well enough that a few goes at it gets them.</li>
    <li> After years and years of buying cheap $2 tweezers and be frustrated by the fact that they don&#x27;t really do a good job, I bought a pair of TWEEZERMAN tweezers. Yes, they are expensive initially but, you will have then for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;If they become dull you can send them back to TWEEZERMAN for a smart price, they will sharpen them for you.&lt;br /&gt;I have several pairs that I keep in rotation so that I always have a sharp pair.&lt;br /&gt;They work well on even the tiniest of hairs, grabbing on with ease, I never thought possible. Plucking takes half the time and much less frustration. There are strong, accurate and well made. Nothing cheap about them, the points line up well for perfect grip. You will not be sorry if you order these tweezers, TWEEZERMAN is all about quality!</li>
    <li> I bought these after several purchases of cheaper tweezers from the drugstore that never really worked that well (and which I ended up spending more on total than these). Completely worth it. They&#x27;re solid, feel great in my hand, and most importantly, can remove really fine hairs and really short hairs without much effort on my part. I have been using them for about two years and cannot think of any flaws. Enough said.</li>
    <li> Better things cost more money.  Always have, always will.  These are probably not the equivalent of what you&#x27;d see in an operating room, but they are much, much better than the flimsy things you see for $4.99 at the local drugstore.</li>
    <li> I love these tweezers. They work wonders on stubborn hairs. I would definitely recommended spending the money on these tweezers!</li>
    <li> I needed tweezers on vacation about 10 years ago, and this brand was all I could find. I was not happy about spending $20 on tweezers, but I was turning into the Wolf Woman, so I bought them. I was so amazed and could not believe the difference. I do have the wolf gene, so these get plenty of work out. They lasted for around 10 years when they &amp;#34;mysteriously&amp;#34; disappeared after my husband used them for a splinter. I am sure they are in his shop or office!! He has already tried to barrow these and I said NO!!!&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers get the small little hairs on my chiney-chin-chin that drive me nuts!!!</li>
    <li> I know they&#x27;re expensive but these are hands down the best tweezers you&#x27;ll ever have. The machined grabbing surfaces meet perfectly unlike any other brand. Give these a shot and you&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had way cheaper tweezers that work just as well. These were super disappointing and I missed the return time frame. :(</li>
    <li> I love Tweezerman and have been using their tweezers for years! I recommend this brand to everyone, but I specifically ordered my tweezers in Granite Sky to replace tweezers of my sister that I had lost and the seller sent me the original steel tweezers instead. I paid extra for the color and while this isn&#x27;t the end of the world, I expected what I paid for. Other than that, tweezers do the job.</li>
    <li> These tweezer are wonderfully.  They grab extremely well compared to all other name brands we have tried.  These do not let things slip out once you get a hold of it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are the classic Tweezerman tweezers that can tweeze any little thing. I love the color of these and I love the functionality even more.</li>
    <li> These tweezers are head and shoulders above drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Revlon Diamond Grip tweezers for years but always had issues with finer hairs ripping instead of being pulled out by the root.  I purchased a pair of fine tipped Tweezerman tweezers and was won over by the quality.  I didn&#x27;t realize how crappy my Revlon tweezers were until I received these.  I have had no problems with hairs breaking like I had with the Revlon.  The grip is just as good, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I aalso think that the lifetime sharpening warranty is great.  These tweezers make plucking quick and easy and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> My favorite tweezers.  it does a great precision job without pinching or hurting my skin.  HIghly recommended!  The Best!</li>
    <li> I love my Tweezerman tweezers. I had an older version and tried to send them back to Tweezerman to be sharpened. I had done this once before with success. I used the same address and the package came back to me as &#x27;undelivered&#x27;. Very odd. It cost me about $2 to send them so I am just out $2. Instead of trying again, I decided to just get another pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a great size which I would describe as a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; tweezer size. They seem to get every thin or short hair. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Buy them.&lt;br /&gt;. Be care when you use them.  They are exactly what I wanted.... Precisely what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I lost my last pair of Tweezwerman tweezers while traveling last year.  I had that pair for over five years and they were wonderful.  This never pair does not feel as heavy and they do not seem to be as precise as the last pair.  They are only slightly better than a pair of Revlon tweezers I bought as a stopgap until I replaced them with the new Tweezerman pair.</li>
    <li> Great tweezers! Easy to use and great gripping ability. Excellent craftsmanship.</li>
    <li> ...However, my wife had me order these for her and she has been full of praise for these tweezers ever since receiving them.  I felt compelled to leave positive feedback to echo her sentiments!  Pros: Plucks hair comfortably and easily.  Comes with a handy plastic cap to protect them.  Cons: Has not yet been able to cure world hunger.  Will update if this changes.</li>
    <li> Works very well, and a nice easy to find color.</li>
    <li> I have gone through many tweezers, most of them were so-so, to get those annoying chin hairs. This twizzer is amazing. Its a little pricey but worth the price. It will become your go-to pair.</li>
    <li> When I was a teenager, like many teenagers, I&#x27;m sure, I had a pair of drugstore tweezers.  And then one Christmas my aunt gave me a pair of Tweezerman in my Christmas stocking.  Holy moly!  These are the best tweezers, without a doubt.  I keep one in my bag and one at home so that I can pluck wherever I am; you may as well call me a pluck-a-holic. And why not?  If I ever start to feel the tiniest stump of a hair, these tweezers are able to pluck them out; you can&#x27;t say the same for drugstore tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these are also the only tweezers you&#x27;ll ever need to buy because Tweezerman has a lifetime sharpening warranty.  I&#x27;ve used the warranty once, several years ago, when I mailed in one of my pairs of Tweezers to get sharpened.  Now, it did take FOREVER for the tweezers to come back (or so it seemed)--it felt so long that that&#x27;s when I bought my second pair of tweezers, because I couldn&#x27;t wait the 4-6 weeks or whatever it was.  But, the tweezers eventually came, all fresh and sharpened and like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I recommend the full-size tweezers (because they&#x27;re easier to grip), but the mini Tweezerman work fine, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tweezers, great company.  If you are not sure about this purchase (vs. a drugstore purchase), don&#x27;t even think twice: get these tweezers!  You will be absolutely amazed at the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Written by Woody&#x27;s wife; Woody does not \\&quot;pluck\\&quot;)</li>
    <li> Made well. Stay sharp for about a year. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I have purchased and inevitably misplaced about 5 pairs of these Tweezerman Slant Tweezers over the years since I was a teenager.  They do such a good job at removing the hairs, and though I have tried many other brands/styles, I always inevitably go back to this particular pair.  Eventually I may have them resharpened, but really at the price on amazon, it seems like a lot of hassle to pay for the shipping back to the company to have them resharpen, and will likely just buy another pair if these ever get dull, before I lose them again!</li>
    <li> These tweezers are ultra-sharp and ultra-precise. They grab the smallest hair on the first try, every time.</li>
    <li> Great product! I absolutely love Tweezerman tweezers, they really are THE best. Item delivered quickly and efficiently.</li>
    <li> Best.  Tweezers.  Ever.</li>
    <li> Works great, plucks both thin and thick hairs.  Well made quality product.  Enjoy that there are so many color options available.</li>
    <li> Good little tweezer.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best tweezers out there. So much easier and more effective than the standard ones from the drugstore.</li>
    <li> These are great tweezers and way better then cheap tweezers sold at retail stores.</li>
    <li> love the color and would buy again</li>
    <li> just very high quality, precise instruments...</li>
    <li> These are bigger than the average tweezer and as excellent as you&#x27;d expect from the Tweezerman name. No complaints at all.</li>
    <li> These tweezers really are the best out there! The slanted tips make tweezing really easy. I have had mine for a long time, and I&#x27;ve even lost the little plastic protector that you are supposed to keep on the end, but mine are still as sharp as the day I got them! I have even bought a backup of these tweezers since this purchase! They are definitely worth the price and I would recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> Great tweezers, love the sharp head, the plastic doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and grips great. Tweezerman&#x27;s lifetime sharpening guarantee is icing on the cake.</li>
    <li> Tweezerman are the best tweezers, bar none. They maintain their spring and hair grip for years. The last time I replaced a pair was because I had dropped the old ones on the ground and the tip was bent on impact.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best tweezer ever...  fast shippng&lt;br /&gt;xxx xxxxxxxxxxxx  xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxx  xxxxxxx  xxxxxxx  xxxxxx xxxx xxxx</li>
    <li> for its price range, these are the best tweezers ive ever used. i use them for my eyebrows and the tips are thin and sharp enough to be very precise in snagging the little single, pain in the butt hairs your shooting for. quality purchase for sure</li>
</ol>
