<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product when used with the tend skin after shave. I wish I had this product years ago.. Shaving would have been much easier. No bumps, no irritation.. Worth every dollar..</li>
    <li> Makes shaving on sensitive skin a joy. I am not a spokesperson for this company, but I will agree that it makes my shaving experience a breeze.</li>
    <li> Horrible with electric shaver...even though its advertised to work with electrics....</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin so smooth and have had no bumps or irritation since I started using it!</li>
    <li> This shave gel works wonders from head to toe on any skin type. I bought it for my fiance because his face is so sensitive, but I ended up buying a bottle of my own! Goes on clear so you can see where you are shaving, a little goes a long way, gives you a silky smooth shave, and the biggest perk: we both haven&#x27;t had razor burn or ingrown hairs AT ALL since we started using it! Totally worth 7 bucks</li>
    <li> I use this shave gel on my armpits and do not get razor burn or unsightly bumps.  It also lets you get a nice close shave. Its saved my summer for me.  Now i can wear all my tank tops and halter tops and bathing suit tops,  without worry or razor bumps or ugly armpits.  I reccommend this shave gel to anyone.  thumbs up.  or should i say armpits up!  LoL</li>
    <li> This product is shave gel so it does provide smooth shaving, but it smells awful!!!  I mean really awful.  I will not be buying this product again just because of the smell.  It smells very medical, I can&#x27;t stand it.  It does work, but does not moisturize, etc. enough for me to deal with that smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this shave gel for about 6 months now, and I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! A little goes a long way and it is better than any foaming shave cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! A tiny amount is needed for shaving, and it is a smooth shave! My legs were better than any shaving cream could make them!</li>
    <li> I get bumps and ingrowns so i bought this stuff but got to thinking, if their ingron bumps product worked why would anyone need the air shave? I could of gotten a better shave with soap and water. Sticking to what works for me and not buying gimmicks in 2012</li>
    <li> I need a clear shaving gel because I shave around my beard. Because I don&#x27;t take it all off, I need to see what I&#x27;m doing. This product works well enough but the scent is nothing to brag about and my wife found a better product at the dollar store -- smoother shave; better scented -- for, yes, a dollar.</li>
    <li> Best EVERRRRR! It&#x27;s literally like there&#x27;s a layer of air between the razor and your skin! And.... you STILL get an amazingly close shave! Perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product, my dad uses it everyday and has for years. He won&#x27;t shave with anything else.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting this stuff to be anything other than your standard shaving gel, and was very surprised with it. This gel is awesome! A very little goes a long way (so it will last a very long while) and it makes your skin baby soft.</li>
    <li> still got bumps after shaving</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this shave gel.</li>
    <li> Excellent for those annoying razor bumps, saw a difference after first usage...Would highly recommend this to any guy who has to deal with some of the annoyances involved with shaving!</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving products husband has ever used!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I was surprising amazed that it worked.  Does not feel like there is anything on your face after you apply it, but it works great to avoid razor burn.  I use it with a Gillet razor and it works great</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Tend Skin Air Shave Gel is the best I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried many different Skintamate and Gillette shave gels, and yes they work. But none  leave my skin feeling as smooth and cool/fresh as Tend Skin Air Shave Gel. I&#x27;m prone to razor bumps and rashes, but not when I use this. I love Air Shave Gel especially for my armpits. I&#x27;m sorry if that&#x27;s to much info, but my armpits are the most sensitive area for shaving. I still get razor bumps, but it&#x27;s improved significantly. I&#x27;d estimate about 80%. A little drop of this goes a very long way. I could go on and on about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-a little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;-razor glides smoothly across skin&lt;br /&gt;-significantly lessens razors bumps/rashes&lt;br /&gt;-skin feels cool/fresh and very smooth after&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-has a very slight medical/alcohol smell. Does not linger on skin though.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too good</li>
    <li> Bought this for a friend. He gets really bad razor bumps on his face... It has helped him tremendously! I&#x27;m thinking about getting it for my bikini line</li>
    <li> My son says it works. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I do waxing and epilating and I&#x27;ve almost finished the bottle and I&#x27;ve still have hair grown under my skin</li>
    <li> This shave gel gets the job done, however, the smell is not very pleasant.  My husband told me he dreaded using it to shave his face and asked for me to buy something different next time.</li>
    <li> This shave gel is amazing for legs that tend to get dry from shaving. It doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as other gels, but once you get used to that, your skin feels so much softer and not as irritated!</li>
    <li> not sure what it is about this stuff but it really does get a close smooth shave and no bumps or itchies.</li>
    <li> I was on my last nerve trying to find something that would work for razor bumps and ingrown hairs on my bikini lines. This is supposed to be a sexy part of my body I can show off in swim suits--but the bumps were embarrassing. This product is like a magic eraser. The effects were immediate. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and there&#x27;s a significant difference in my legs and the rate of hair growth there (went from being very prickly needing to shave ever 2/3 days to now going 5 days with minimal growth) and my razor bumps are getting better with every shave! Sooooooooo pleased and will continue to buy this product forever. Must have if you suffer from bumps and ingrown hairs!</li>
    <li> Definitely reduces razor burn!</li>
    <li> Shaving is a breeze with this. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like soap does. My legs are smooth!  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the best product for shaving. It seems a little expensive, but it&#x27;s really not. A little goes a looooong way, as you only need a few drops to shave your entire face. I think I probably got over 200 shaves out of my last bottle.</li>
    <li> I purchased Tend Skins after shave or razor bumps and it worked great, so I thought I would try the shaving gel and I am glad I did.  Only need a small amount for head and face and it protects your skin with a thin layer of gel which gives you an awesome shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products and this product has the best glide...Great for wet electric shavers.  Only wish they would skip the blue coloring.</li>
    <li> WE have been using Tendskin Airshave Gel for years, it is simply the best. No nicks, cuts or scrapes, totally smooth.  We use the lotion too, my wife is prone to razor bumps and between the gel and the lotion, they just never happen anymore..</li>
    <li> The best product that I&#x27;ve ever used,  im a die hard customer now. I wont use anything else Im sold on this pproduct.</li>
    <li> best stuff to use if you get razor burn!  I use this and tend skin solution on my legs that would get horrible razor burn.  Since using this I have noticed less bumps and less itching after shaving... I think this stuff is amazing.  It is a bit pricey, but well worth it also you don&#x27;t use a lot when shaving, it says apply thin layer.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT! CLOSEST SHAVE EVER!</li>
    <li> Avoids irritation but doesn&#x27;t allow for a close enough shave</li>
    <li> Was recommended by our dermatologist but didn&#x27;t seem to help acne prone skin. We&#x27;re hoping for better results from the product.</li>
    <li> Very,very Nice!Great Item&#x3D;Great Seller+Fast Shipping+Great Communication.Thank U</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> This was so ineffective. I saw no reduction in ingrown hairs and my skin was also not protected from razor cuts and razor burn. I switched back to shaving with bar soap and have gotten no cuts, whereas with this, I got cuts all over. Doesn&#x27;t seem any different from other shaving creams out there, which have never worked for me.</li>
    <li> I just used this product about ten minutes ago and I wanted to make sure I reviewed it before I forgot. I&#x27;m 31 years old and I&#x27;ve tried  every kind of shaving product under the sun. I currently use a automatic shaver, a braun 5 series, which I love except since I started using it, I noticed I would get isolated ingrown hairs and the shave just wasn&#x27;t as close. Not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying a small amount of shaving gel and spreading it all over my face and neck, I did my normal shave and was surprised to see that the shave was closer to my skin and afterwards, I felt zero irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have to apply some aftershave to soften the skin, but with this product, you&#x27;ll feel as if you already have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s not just me being a screaming fan, but they&#x27;ve received hundreds of reviews like this. Thanks to amazon, I have access to finding companies like this. I will never go to &amp;#34;Target&amp;#34; to find products for my skin ever again.</li>
    <li> I love the tend skin line. Especially the lotion. But this shave gel is amazing stuff..You only need a tiny bit and it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;It reduces friction so I dont get cuts and knicks like i used to.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it leaves the skin soothed and cuts back on ingrown hairs and acne from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Decent good reviews so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try mostly to see it would help to eliminate razor bumps particularly in more sensitive areas of the body.  Perhaps there is a little improvement in the irritation caused by other shaving gels but not enough to be for certain.  Overall, the consistency of the gel is thick and tends to clog cartridge razors.  Works better with a straight razor or safety razor.  And, since it&#x27;s basically clear, it&#x27;s a little difficult to tell where you&#x27;ve shaved so you end up going back over the same areas again, which can lead to irritation.  Most likely would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and the beard on my neck grows in every direction.  Because of this, I have always suffered with ugly, painful razor bumps.  I have tried every razor, shaving cream/gel, and after-shave under the sun (Prorasso, Nivea, Bump Stopper, Maria Badescu, Lab Series, the list goes on).  Some work better than others but I still get bumps.  Tend Skin has changed that.  First off, it&#x27;s transparent so you can see the hair and shave with the grain.  It is very slick, not the slickest I&#x27;ve used but slick enough and the results speak for themselves.  Most importantly, I no longer get bumps.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff but it works which is all that matters.  My only complaint is the price but it is worth every penny and a pea-sized dab shaves my whole face so it goes a long way.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> Never used it before now and it is awesome. Smooth and silky, smells great and my husband uses if daily</li>
    <li> Tend Skin did a great job in minimizing razor bumps on my seventeen year old son. He had been having problems for some time until he used this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and find that a small amount will suffice for shaving my tough beard.  Dollar for dollar it is a better buy than the normal over the counter creams.</li>
    <li> Great line of products! My skin has never looked this good after shaving. No razor bumps! Highly recommended! If you have issues with razor bumps, buy this line of products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got to be honest, Tend Skin has changed my life!  Nothing compares when it comes to Ingrown hair treatment!  I&#x27;ve tried everything you can dream of, from Laser treatments, to Bumpstopper 1 &amp; 2.. to Essential oils,  to  home remedies.  Previously I was using Crew shave oil, with Crew Shave Gel, them Tend Skin.  Now that I&#x27;ve found Air Shave Gel, I save $ and it works great!!</li>
    <li> I like it very well not to foamy goes on smooth you don&#x27;t have to use to much I still have more than half the bottle excellent product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the search for \\&quot;a better way to shave\\&quot;, so I started by experimenting with different shave lubricants. This was the first alternative shaving lubricant I tried after previous experiments over the years with various creams and traditional gels. Regular shaving cream has always worked reasonably well for me, but it could be better, and the fact that it tends to obscure what you&#x27;re shaving has definitely bothered me. So this product had a lot of potential.    What I hadn&#x27;t bargained for is the horrible, horrible smell of this stuff, and how much that small lingers long after you shave. I&#x27;m used to a nice \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; Gillette aftershave smell in my shaving cream, which my girlfriend really likes. I didn&#x27;t need it to be like that, I can always use after shave, but it did at least need to not smell awful, which sadly it does. I&#x27;ve used various shave gels, all of them with varying scents, but none of them were actually repellent like this stuff is. It&#x27;s hard to describe, it literally smells medicinal, almost like prescription strength anti-dandruff shampoo, and it sticks with you just as badly. Still, I thought, if it really improves my shave, maybe it&#x27;s worth it?    Unfortunately it does not seem be much of an improvement, if any. I think the primary advantage is it&#x27;s mostly clear (though it does sometimes create a very slight white foam), so you can see exactly what you&#x27;re shaving. It does have a very slick feel to it, which you would think would improve things a lot, but after quite a few uses overall I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s a big enough difference to warrant its use.    On top of all that it&#x27;s got a lot of chemicals and a completely unnecessary blue dye ingredient. So I really don&#x27;t recommend this product. I would have given it a 1 if it actually did a worse job than shaving cream, but it&#x27;s at least reasonably comparable. But that horrible smell...    On to trying shaving oils...</li>
    <li> Stats: Female, disposable razor(s), total body hair removal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shave my body I always use this gel. It makes my legs extremely smooth and makes pubic grooming a lot less irritating. I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m not as itchy afterwards when I use the gel than without. I&#x27;ve also noticed increased smoothness and even tone on my armpits. I also use this shave gel on my face (high testosterone), which really helps the blade glide over the skin and has reduced almost all instances bumps and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get occasional nicks on my shins and inner thighs, as well as ingrown hairs near the pubic region and in the sideburn area. This shave gel doesn&#x27;t really treat ingrown hairs, only prevents them somewhat. If it did treat I&#x27;d give 5/5 stars. It&#x27;s still a great product, though and worth the money if you use cheapy razors.</li>
    <li> I used to have terrible razor bumps.  I dreaded shaving.  My legs would burn a lot after shaving especially if I went out in the sun afterwards.  Tend Skin Shave Gel has made shaving a whole different experience.  No more cuts and bumps.  No more burning.  My legs are baby smooth.  It literally has changed my life.</li>
    <li> Have always used tend skin solution and decided to get shave gel for husband. He love this product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most superior product I have ever found that truly works.  Very easy to use, although I suggest not using a lot of water with your application.  It smells a bit medicimal, however, with the results it provides I cannot complain about that at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my brother. It was taken care of the razor bumps like a champ. I also purchase the Tend Skin tonic for the back of his neck. Believe the hype, Tend Skin works!</li>
    <li> As lubricant it is awesome, the smell leaves something to be desired but all in all it is a solid product and does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> This product makes the razor just glide over your skin it&#x27;s smooth really protects your skin against razors scrapes preventing razor bumps and other irritations</li>
    <li> This thing has has such a weird janitorial odor that it smells wrong to use. I used it last night with minimal facial stub and my Braun 7 series wet/dry and it did an okay job. Rather then slathering my whole face with it I may go by sections. I&#x27;m still up in the air if it&#x27;s a game changer. I may wait until I have more stubble and provide another review.</li>
    <li> Great product for outlining your own beard or mustache... it&#x27;s clear and you won&#x27;t nick yourself or shave off too much!</li>
    <li> The smoothest shave I have ever had. Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I have extremely sensitive skin and a mild form of eczema, I use this and  dermatologist recommended ( Amalactin)  lotion for my skin. No razor burn, no dryness, no itching or redness.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for several years now and I highly recommend it!  I used to get ingrown hairs/foliculitis but this product seems to improve it tremendously!!! Def Recommend!!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way,  and very moisturizing. The smell could use a little work, it&#x27;s a bit unpleasant but nothing I can&#x27;t tolerate.</li>
    <li> Nice shave however still get red bumps 3 days later.</li>
    <li> Easily the best shave gel I have ever used. I tend to get a rash after shaving. After getting great results from using the tendskin liquid on my face, I decided to try this shaving gel and will never use anything else again. Zero rash after shaving today.</li>
    <li> asdf&lt;br /&gt;This is the best gel made for electric shaving in the shower. I&#x27;ve tried others, but they don&#x27;t compare. You only need a small dab, and  you will get the best shave possible with an electric wet shaver.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Wet your shaver thoroughly before beginning to shave. This way the gel won&#x27;t stick to the inside of your shaver, making it very easy to quickly rinse the gel out of the inside of your shaver after you&#x27;re done. Even though you only use a small amount of gel, if you don&#x27;t get your shaver wet first, the gel will stick inside your shaver, making it just a little more difficult to clean after you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will never (if I can help it) use any other shave gel product again. A little bit goes a long way and results provided are smooth. No more razor bumps or fussy bumps like before when using other shave cream, gel and foam products. It&#x27;s not greasy or irritating to the skin in any way. I have very sensative skin and am very careful about what skin products I use. This product in my opinion beats out any \\&quot;sensative skin\\&quot; shave gel on the market.</li>
    <li> Well, I never really wrote a review on a product before, but I am going to take the time and share my experience with this product. I am new with DE shaving. I am trying everything on the market out, my wife is so mad due to the products I have been buying... I like to try a lot of different products to see which is best and what I like. I personally do read reviews and base my decision of what other have left determining if I would buy the item I am looking at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far, this Air Shave Gel is so slick... My DE and regular razor glides with ease. I&#x27;m talking about my razor(s) just glides across my face, I was like what????? The best way to describe this slickness is like having the famous KY jelly on your face....LOL.... I am so impressed with the results it&#x27;s incredible...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went a step further, I also used Proraso Pre-shave Cream, Refresh, 3.6 Ounce on my face before applying the Air Gel! WOW!!! What a combination.... Try it out! I was like dang, two peas in a pod. My face felt so refreshing and the closeness of the shave, like baby skin... Even my wife asked me what I changed and did different. So I hope this helps, if I find another great product to rave about, I will start typing away!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old and this is the first time I&#x27;ve gotten a close shave and my legs don&#x27;t look dried out when I&#x27;m done. Why didn&#x27;t they make this stuff 50 some years ago!</li>
    <li> Difficult review.  This product is actually a gel, and may be better for non-electric means of hair removal (i.e. dont use it if you use an electric, it will not let the actual razor parts close enough to get a decent shave)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT being said, if you suffer at all from red rash/bumps/ingrown hairs, this product is amazing.  Seriously amazing.  Like, amazing enough to make me seriously consider switching to a straight/safety razor. Fortunately, Tend Skin also makes a liquid with a roller ball applicator.  Not quite as amazing (the gel does a better job of lasting after the shave) but still very very good.  Combined with Lectric Shave, this is my new choice for masking my neckbeard status.</li>
    <li> I have a history of trouble with razor bumps, irritation, and bleeding neck. Traditionally have used Mach 3 razors and either edge gel sensitive , gillette sensitive, or barbosol creams, followed by a lotion aftershave, usually afta, but have tried others. So over the 18 yrs of shaving and putting up with rough neck I have tried to take care of my skin in the process. I decided to try some new stuff. I bought this shave gel and received a few weeks ago. After this time I am convinced I will be a lifetime consumer of this product. Its like KY jelly for the razor against your neck and leaves the skin smooth and comfortable with almost zero irritation. All this with no other products! I also in a desire to save cash tried the Dorco 6 blade razors. If you like the mach 3 or fusion I am confident u will like the Dorco6 as well while saving a few bucks. Air shave gel, Get it!</li>
    <li> Perfect for that ..... &amp;#34;Just Right&amp;#34; shave!</li>
    <li> The liquid it&#x27;s much better</li>
    <li> Put about a quarter size amount on your hand and that will get you through a good shave.  No major odor, blue in color.  Overall pleased.</li>
    <li> This product really works great....gives your face the right enough of protection yet its almost transparent....I cant shave without it.....</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! If you have any problems with shaving or irritation this will really help! I would recommend this to product</li>
    <li> the old formula was a better, more effective product</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and use a straight edge and a DE Razor. I am in constant search for that magic product that will eliminate my razor burn. Fortunate for me I don&#x27;t get razor bumps!! That must be a nightmare. So I can&#x27;t speak for that.&lt;br /&gt;I used it with my straight razor and it felt a bit sticky and not slick, so I constantly found myself adding water to my face to help guide my razor along. I still got razor burn. I can only imagine using this with my Double Edge Razor? What a nightmare that would be clogging my blade. In my opinion this is not better than using my shave soap and brush.&lt;br /&gt;  This may work well for Women in the shower using a multi- blade razor?? I personally will stay with shave cream.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving gel that I can use.  My legs are so sensitive to shaving cream that I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shaving since I was a teenager.  This is the first product that I can use to shave that doesn&#x27;t make my legs bleed.  This is truly a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> The air shave gel alone made a stark difference in the amount of razor bumps I had in my bikini zone, but I typically use this along with the Tend skin.  When I first tried it, I used it first with a razor that was used previously to be sure the difference wasn&#x27;t the new blade.  When used under the arms, my shave was much closer as well.</li>
    <li> Better then shaving cream</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money !</li>
    <li> In one word I would have to say miracle. This is a miracle product for dry, ugly, skin like mine! My skin reacts horribly to a razor and even more terribly when lathered with most any sort of shave cream or gel. I&#x27;ve tried all the drugstore brands for every sort of skin (sensitive, dry, normal), for males, females and african american hair. Ive even spent upwards of $30 on deparment brands like Zirh. Nothing has worked like this stuff does. So worth the money if youre like me and are embarassed of your legs and whatever else you might shave. I am an avid user of the Tend Skin liquid but for some reason I never knew about this stuff! Thank goodness I came across it.  Im actually excited to shave now. Buy!!</li>
    <li> It could be better. I feel as if I have to continuously shave over the area because of how gooey this stuff is. It sometimes doesn&#x27;t allow my razor to get a close enough shave. I have to repeat shaving 3 or 4 times so I have no stubble. However it&#x27;s left me with no razor bumps, ingrown hairs or cuts.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my husband because he is a long time user of Tend Skin solution.  Based on the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d found a perfect alternative to his much pricier high end shaving cream.  No such luck.  He&#x27;s used it for about 2 weeks and has already abandoned it.  He gets razor bumps on his neck despite using this product over his usual shave oil.  I also tried it and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the scent (it smells a bit skunky...although not as bad as the Tend Skin solution!).  To the trash it goes...bummer.</li>
    <li> I shave my handicapped son with this wonderful gel, it keeps his skin feeling smooth and conditioned......less hair bumps.&lt;br /&gt;I would stronly recommend this product to Barbers and men using a razor.</li>
    <li> Great product!  For the last several years I&#x27;ve been getting a razor rash on my legs every time I shave.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of blade I use, or how much shaving cream I pile on.  Within 24 hours I have an itchy bumpy rash all over my legs that drives me insane with the itching.  I saw this when I was reordering some Tend Skin, so decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times so far, and NO rash whatsoever.  It doesn&#x27;t foam; it&#x27;s like an aloe vera gel in consistency.  But boy does it work!  Zero itching, zero rash.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This works better than any shaving cream I have every used. I also use the Tend Skin liquid and it works like magic to keep razor at bay.</li>
    <li> Better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I get bad ingrown hairs that cause bumps all over my neck and ever since I started using this along with the Tend Skin after shave I have all but got rid of them.</li>
    <li> my fiance says it&#x27;s the smoothest shave he&#x27;s ever had and my legs are silky smooth too!  great product, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> BEST. EVER. I&#x27;ll never shave with anything else. Also, it lasts forever!</li>
    <li> Bought this for the first time to use with the after shave, it really helps to control the razor bumps.</li>
    <li> This shaving gel is amazing.  It keeps my husband and me from getting razor burn, it cleans up nicely and doesn&#x27;t create foamy messes in the shower.  One bottle lasts months!</li>
    <li> It works so far. I have only used it underarm so far. I will see how it works on legs and bikini and do an update.</li>
    <li> I am the type of person that has a 2:00 shadow.  Needless to say, I have been searching for the right shaving product for years now.  I used Air Shave Gel for the first time about 10 minutes ago and immediately went back to my computer to write my first Amazon review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face and then rubbed in about a nickel/quarter sized amount of the gel on my face and neck.  At first, I was dubious, because you cant see the gel on your face, it doesn&#x27;t foam or bubble, and frankly, it feels unnatural to trust that a gel will protect your face with a razor blade running over it.  I was wrong!  I used a week-old mach 3 razor (in the shower) and it simply glided right over my beard, with AND against the grain.  I could immediately tell that I was getting a smooth shave.  After getting out of the shower, I felt as if I had a barbershop shave AND as if I had already applied aftershave.  All in all, I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former Routine: Shave Secret Oil, Edge Gel Shaving Cream, then Poraso Aftershave&lt;br /&gt;New Routine: Air Shave Gel Only</li>
    <li> My leg have never been so smooth. I bought it for my son, I ran out of the stuff I used one day and borrowed his......ordered my own bottle when I got out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It really works!</li>
    <li> This product really give you a  close shave with no bumps or nicks. And the area you shave is so smooth afterwards.  Would recommend to any woman who shave.</li>
    <li> I received a fake product! The label looks completely different than the one shown here and on the company&#x27;s website. Smells different from the original too. Definitely don&#x27;t want to put this on my skin. Don&#x27;t order!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic. I get the closest shave with no razor burn and it lasts longer too! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. But I&#x27;m sure genetics play a big role in results</li>
    <li> So far so great!!! I started using an electric shaver for my bikini area and got this to go along with it. I have used it twice and I have not had one issue with the ingrown hairs that were the bane of my shaving life prior to purchasing this. I even shaved against the grain and with this product I personally have not experienced any irritation or bumps as a result.</li>
    <li> perfect for sensitive skin! no irritation of ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the smoothest shave possible. I can pass the razor over the area from many angles for baby smooth skin without refreshing the gel and each pass glides as easily as the first. Does not foam and only a very small amount is needed. I use it in the shower so hairs are already softened - I&#x27;ve never experienced a better shave!</li>
    <li> The product is a great shave cream substitute, but I did not quite get the satisfaction I get from using a soap puck and a brush. The texture was also strange and unfamiliar, so I did feel slightly uncomfortable using the product.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard.  This is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Really made a difference along with electrolysis. My face looks 100 percent better. The I browns caused my skin to hyper pigment. Even my fine hairs were doing the same. I had beautiful skin, then I decided to do laser on my chin and cheeks for the fine hairs. Big mistake, when I stopped laser, the fine hairs grew back longer and some became in grown, for years I struggles until I researched and decided electrolysis is the only permanent hair removal and my doing has been looking better ever since then. No more grown hairs and no more bumps from those ingrown hairs</li>
    <li> I get bumps really badly on my neck post-shave, and while in the Navy I had to shave every day. My neck burned constantly and I would have to individually tweez out every ingrown hair which was tedious and time consuming. This product greatly reduces the nu,ber of ingrown hairs I get and makes my skin much more comfortable. I use it with my Braun 7 series eclectic shaver and it cleans up great.</li>
    <li> Product is for my husband.  He has used it for a number of years and likes it.</li>
    <li> Good for a safe and clean shave. Trying to avoid ingrowths, hoping this works for that.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by my barber as I have sensitive skin when I shave and this did not reduce the reaction my skin has. Note, I also tried a number of different shaving creams while testing this product.</li>
    <li> Weird, didn&#x27;t feel like I could get it off</li>
    <li> I *like* the Tend Skin toner -- which *really does* work to deter razor burn, rashes, ingrown hairs, etc.  And this shave gel works up into a nice blue lather OK.  But it REEKS like a bowling alley bathroom!  WTF were the mad scientists at TNG thinking when they picked the scent for this stuff?  Actually, I&#x27;ve smelled toilet bowl sanitizer that&#x27;s more appealing that this stuff!  Bought it once.  Used it twice (to give it the benefit of the doubt); then threw it away.  In a word, NASTY.</li>
    <li> Pros: A little of the product goes a long way.  It helps minimize hair growth and razor bumps/burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Medicinal smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little of both: The product goes on clear so it&#x27;s hard to tell where I&#x27;ve already shaved. Some people find this a good thing.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving gel for razor or wet/dry electric razor.  I mainly use a wet/dry electric razor and this gel is slick and no razor burn.  My electric shaver still looks like new.  Tend Skin Air Save Gel rinses off manual or electric razor&#x27;s completely.  My only complaint is that you have to get used to the smell, not bad but to me smells like motor oil.  After a week or so of daily use you won&#x27;t smell it anymore.</li>
    <li> easy to use in the shower, doesn&#x27;t just rinse away. shaving is smoother than with shaving lotion. i recomend to every one!!!!</li>
    <li> I like the gel shave, but I have not see any diffent with the bumbs, no improvement yet and I have been useing it for weeks.</li>
    <li> My small town medical spa quit carrying this product. I can&#x27;t live without it. I used to get horrible razor burn/acne. It changed my whole complexion. THANKS TEND SKIN!</li>
    <li> Love this Shave gel!  Also bought it for my son, he called it awesome!</li>
    <li> Works well with my head.</li>
    <li> Tend Skin makes QUALITY products.  I love their air shave gel.  Makes for a nice smooth shave everytime I use it.  It&#x27;s the only Shave gel I use.</li>
