### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and Beautiful!</li>
      <li>so I could perfect it when I went out that night.</li>
      <li>I find it works best to twist my pony tail so that the hair is compact, then fan the ends out into the clip.</li>
      <li>Service was great!  </li>
      <li>CONAIR-PLEASE REDESIGN THIS PRODUCT WITH A BETTER CLIP!!!!!!</li>
      <li>The roller form does make a beautiful shape out of the hair, but the clip--which is paramount to any of it working--rarely holds.  </li>
      <li>its is great but not for me</li>
      <li>Maybe good for someone that has thinner hair.</li>
      <li>The pagckaging was good and it got to me in time.</li>
      <li>The clip&#x27;s metal pieces fit together perfectly when flush, however will not clip when any hair is added to the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you get it  good luck.</li>
      <li>This could have been a great product if the designers had incorporated a better clip.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s honestly easier to look at a YouTube video and do it yourself, then to use this.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how this kind of junk gets manufactured and how it makes it onto the shelves.</li>
      <li>There is no way that this clip will hold your hair on its&#x27; own, even if you use hair spray.</li>
      <li>sure if attached clip is good idea.  </li>
      <li>Teasing and day old hair works best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great concept, but I don&#x27;t think Conair got it quite right.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine...</li>
      <li>And I have very fine hair.</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Quick &amp; Easy To Use!</li>
      <li>I found that when I got to the top, I had to rearrange and re-smooth some of the pieces of hair.</li>
      <li>I made sure to take it with me in the morning</li>
      <li>, I rolled the clip to the top of my hair, smoothing as I went.</li>
      <li>I am sure it is just me as I cannot claim I am by any stretch of the imagination a hairdresser...</li>
      <li>But something tells me you&#x27;d probably need more than the four pins included.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to have to try to figure out if I can fit one of my own barrettes inside the roller to make it work.  </li>
      <li>I might as well have used a $5 bill to roll up my hair with - it would work better, and I&#x27;d still have the $5 when I took my hair</li>
      <li>i would pay more for a better quality</li>
      <li>At finish, at top of head, loop remaining hair around to form curl[s] and tuck ends into and under top of twist.  </li>
      <li>With some practice you can get awesome victory rolls, and French twists.</li>
      <li>but love my hair dressed.</li>
      <li>nowadays so I am glad it&#x27;s sold</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t clip, if you are able to clip it, it won&#x27;t stay clipped.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t understand how so many people have said that this doesn&#x27;t work for them</li>
      <li>most of the time it comes undone as you are trying to twist.  </li>
      <li>I will purchase more items from this seller.</li>
      <li>many compliments while wearing my hair like this with this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keeping your hair relatively flat is the best way to get the clip to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I could see these issues with long hair by my hair is the perfect length.</li>
      <li>Sure, if you have ultra-thin and fine hair, and even then, I doubt it.  </li>
      <li>You need to put the bobby pins through your hair and make sure you secure them to the netting on the clip.</li>
      <li>Conceptually this is good, but in practice not so much.  </li>
      <li>Quick, easy, for all hair types!  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;Easy to use\\&quot; -</li>
      <li>Their other prodct I have (perfect pony) is fantastic.</li>
      <li>This was so easy to use after a few goes to perfect, like anything.</li>
      <li>When I realized It wasn&#x27;t going to work because my hair didn&#x27;t fit on the twist</li>
      <li>I didnt bother returning it, it costs more to ship this than what its worth.</li>
      <li>This could have been a great product, but it fell short.</li>
      <li>Use whatever size hairpins works for your type hair to secure this section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Secure hold\\&quot;</li>
      <li>When I decided that I just wanted to see if I could complete the rest of the steps and didn&#x27;t care about how good it looked, I attempted to move to step three.</li>
      <li>and it looks pretty good, but this was waayyy to much work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great idea, but not completely workable.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>not user friendly.</li>
      <li>Intend to purchase a shaper like this soon, because I had one in past and used it with great results!  </li>
      <li>I just purchased this today and was excited to try it for the holidays.</li>
      <li>I have tried to put it on several times &amp; I have not been successful.</li>
      <li>The pitcure predicited the product to be large  fitting the crown on your head when I received it</li>
      <li>This would be a great product if the clip would stay closed.  </li>
      <li>If you have to start rolling all the way from the very ends, most of your hair falls out of the roll.  </li>
      <li>The clip holder has no way of securing the arm; its completely smooth, so it just slips right out.  </li>
      <li>I never could make a french twist but with the help of this item it only took minutes to make a perfect french twist and everyone loved it.</li>
      <li>The clip is super flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t hold.  </li>
      <li>- Maybe if you&#x27;re lucky and get your hair wrapped around the clip and the hair pins in place.</li>
      <li>My hair is long, I couldn&#x27;t  use it , maybe with short hair would be perfect.</li>
      <li>, I have medium length, fine straight hair.  </li>
      <li>the idea is great but the product is not solid and strong enough to hold hair</li>
      <li>My hair is quite fine, so the problem isn&#x27;t that I have too much hair to clip.  </li>
      <li>I gave it to my daughter who has straight hair that is fine to medium, and it won&#x27;t even come close to holding her hair either.  </li>
      <li>I really recommend spin pins for a secure hold.</li>
      <li>I had too much hair to fit into the opening and the clip would not close.  </li>
      <li>I paid four dollars for this clip, and I think that&#x27;s about what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Right.).  </li>
      <li>This took a fair amount of adjusting because I made it too wide the first time.</li>
      <li>I will preface this by saying my hair is pretty fine/thin.</li>
      <li>, I took a pair of pliers and bent the clip out to make it wider to accommodate more hair, then I had to bend back the part that tucks into the clip so it would close.</li>
      <li>Love the french twist hairstyle, but this tool makes it an exercise in futility to accomplish.  </li>
      <li>the bottom of the clip was poking through the first time I tried to fasten it.  </li>
      <li>Also, the clip feels a bit flimsy, and it is easy to bend it out of shape if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
      <li>Affix shaper to scalp with long bobby pins inserted vertically, one at top and one up from bottom.  </li>
      <li>The gel also helps the shorter sections of hair stick together so they don&#x27;t fall out as easily and are easier to put back into place and have them stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>clip is too tiny to get all of your hair through, except if you have hair that is extremely fine, and even then it wouldn&#x27;t stay in.  </li>
      <li>The whole idea behind this product is great.  </li>
      <li>And I have medium-fine, straight hair, so I would hink if anyone could use it I could.</li>
      <li>There was absolutely no way I could get the clip to close at the top of my hair, so I skipped that step.</li>
      <li>i expected a better quality but for the price i was accepting of the product.</li>
      <li>I could never get it to stay closed in my hair for more than 5 seconds, and then it just fell out.</li>
      <li>The clip wouldn&#x27;t even stay closed for more than two seconds...literally.</li>
      <li>I have too much hair</li>
      <li>so this is very unacceptable.</li>
      <li>I agree with most of the other reviewers.</li>
      <li>I was glad to see the other reviews about this product on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>long, but definitely fine.  </li>
      <li>I have long, fine hair, so you&#x27;d think this would work well.  </li>
      <li>The instructions could be more detailed but otherwise, it works well and for those of us who have fine, thin hair, it adds &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; to the french roll!</li>
      <li>finally got the clip to stay shut and was able to make a decent french twist, but I had to modify the directions a bit.</li>
      <li>(it took me about 20 minutes from start to finish), but it will look decent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> hard to use but described correctly.</li>
    <li> I have lost a lot of hair do to illness so I know my hair is no longer thick and I thought maybe this would work.  Wrong!!!!  It won&#x27;t clip, if you are able to clip it, it won&#x27;t stay clipped.  It should work but they engineered this incorrectly.  Once you put some hair in it, the clip becomes to long to clip it together.  Do not buy it.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale for $2.00 and I am taking the product back.  It was only $2.00, but I cannot believe what junk this is!  The clip is super flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t hold.  If the clip held really tight, I think it would hold a little bit better.  Also, someone else wrote that if the clip was bigger that might help too.  I agree, but as it stands....flushing your money down the drain would be the same thing as buying this product.   Don&#x27;t these people test the product before they attempt to sell it?</li>
    <li> there is no way for the barrett portion to stay clipped. I have no idea how the even passed this product for sale. It doesn&#x27;t work! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all. clip doesn&#x27;t stay closed. it&#x27;s too slippery to grip hair. it needs to have some grip or something to make it work</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine this working for anyone, even somebody with very thin hair. As for myself, I have medium thickness and medium-long length, and it was absolutely impossible to get this to work.</li>
    <li> The instructions could be more detailed but otherwise, it works well and for those of us who have fine, thin hair, it adds &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; to the french roll!</li>
    <li> What a waste of money! I don&#x27;t care if I spent only $4, I&#x27;m getting my money back. I just wasted 15 minutes wrestling with this irritating as hell clip. I can barely get my hair into it because it&#x27;s thick, then I cannot for the life of me clip it closed. Whoever designed this is a moron. I bought it because I have a perfect pony tool and love it, but this is too terrible for words. DO NOT buy!</li>
    <li> I think we reviewers are unanimous:  It doesn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s a waste of money.  I have thick hair and I couldn&#x27;t get the clip closed.  If I started all the way at the ends of my hair, it clipped but came unclipped as I tried to roll my hair onto the thing.  If you have to start rolling all the way from the very ends, most of your hair falls out of the roll.  This thing is awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> My hair is average thickness and this won&#x27;t even come close to closing and holding my hair. I didn&#x27;t even make it to the step of trying to roll it into a french twist. This is junk. Fail Conair, big big fail.</li>
    <li> to small for adults to use with normal amount of hair.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy this again as I also thought it was inclulded with other products bought at the same time and wound up paying for 6 s/h fees in excess of $5. each for the items that cost less than a $1.00...</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart today because i&#x27;ve been dying to do a french twist and thought this would be the easiest way.  The darn thing took forever to get on my hair correctly, it took forever to clip on since the metal latch is so darn small and lastly when i WAS able to twist the hair up after about 7 tries or so, it looked ridiculous and didn&#x27;t hold at all. I&#x27;m returning this crap.  My hair type:  Medium thickness  Long hair</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and it was absolutely impossible to close the clip.  It seems as they the company didn&#x27;t bother to even try it out on an actual person before marketing and selling it.  Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Do not even think about buying this if you have thick hair as I do. I couldn&#x27;t even properly complete step two because the clip wouldn&#x27;t open up far enough. When I decided that I just wanted to see if I could complete the rest of the steps and didn&#x27;t care about how good it looked, I attempted to move to step three. The clip wouldn&#x27;t even stay closed for more than two seconds...literally. Even when I tried to put up half of my hair, it wouldn&#x27;t stay. The metal arm of the clip and its holder are simply too thin. The clip holder has no way of securing the arm; its completely smooth, so it just slips right out.  Almost everything the front of the box claims is extremely misleading.  \\&quot;Easy to use\\&quot; - Sure, if you have ultra-thin and fine hair, and even then, I doubt it.  \\&quot;Secure hold\\&quot; - Maybe if you&#x27;re lucky and get your hair wrapped around the clip and the hair pins in place. But something tells me you&#x27;d probably need more than the four pins included.  \\&quot;For all hair types\\&quot; - Clearly, no.  This was ultimately a waste of money. I just wish I would have looked up reviews before purchasing this kit.</li>
    <li> This would be a great product if the clip would stay closed.  Sometimes it does; most of the time it comes undone as you are trying to twist.  My hair is quite fine, so the problem isn&#x27;t that I have too much hair to clip.  It should be very easy to engineer a clip that closes firmly and stays closed as you pull the tool down your hair and then start twisting it up.</li>
    <li> As others have said, the clip won&#x27;t stay clipped. It&#x27;s hard to clip, but once you get it clipped and slide the thing down your hair it unclips. And I have medium-fine, straight hair, so I would hink if anyone could use it I could.</li>
    <li> Do not buy!  I don&#x27;t even have thick hair, I have medium length, fine straight hair.  I tried over and over.  Once I was able to get it to secure over my hair, every single time I started to twist it to begin the French Twist, the clip would pop open.  No matter how loose or how gentlly I twisted.  This item totally disappoints and doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair was too thick for it</li>
    <li> This item is extremely difficult to use, and is not really what I was expecting when i ordered it.  For one thing, it isn&#x27;t long enough, and when you clip it on your hair and start rolling the hair into a twist, the clip pops open and you have to start over again.  I would not recommend this item at all.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair, it doesn&#x27;t work. My hair is shoulder length and doesn&#x27;t look that thick. Maybe good for someone that has thinner hair.</li>
    <li> This thing is no good if you have more than three hairs on your whole head.  I ripped the cheapo wire the bottom of the clip was poking through the first time I tried to fasten it.  I&#x27;ve only managed to close the clip two out of a bazillion times, and my hair slipped right out both times when I tried to roll it up.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of crap.  Put it in a retirement fund instead.</li>
    <li> Unless you&#x27;re under 5 years old AND have baby-fine hair, there is no way this will work.  The clip is so ridiculously small, I think it will only hold about 8 strands of my thick, wavy hair.  I gave it to my daughter who has straight hair that is fine to medium, and it won&#x27;t even come close to holding her hair either.  I think Conair needs to increase their R&amp;D budget, or at least stop hiring chimpanzees to do their product testing.</li>
    <li> Conceptually this is good, but in practice not so much.  I couldn&#x27;t get the clip closed.&lt;br /&gt;The one time, I did it popped open before my hair was rolled up. And as they say that was that.</li>
    <li> Quick, easy, for all hair types!  That&#x27;s what the packaging claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clip is too tiny to get all of your hair through, except if you have hair that is extremely fine, and even then it wouldn&#x27;t stay in.  Not for all hair types then!  The clip will not close,  and even when it does close (though I only achieved this by brutally bending the metal, I hasten to add), there is no mechanism to keep it closed, so the slide keeps popping out of the clip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe this managed to get into shops.  If I could I&#x27;d give it zero stars.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine...long, but definitely fine.  I had too much hair to fit into the opening and the clip would not close.  Love the french twist hairstyle, but this tool makes it an exercise in futility to accomplish.  Watch some vids on YouTube for instructions on doing this style yourself.  It takes practice, just like french braiding or other styles, but it can be accomplished without the use of a product that definitely does not work as advertised.</li>
    <li> My hair is long, I couldn&#x27;t  use it , maybe with short hair would be perfect. If you get it  good luck.</li>
    <li> The clip inside to hold hair in place will not stay closed.  I&#x27;m going to have to try to figure out if I can fit one of my own barrettes inside the roller to make it work.  It&#x27;s a great idea, but not completely workable.  Need a flatter barrette inside the roller to catch and stay closed.</li>
    <li> The pitcure predicited the product to be large  fitting the crown on your head when I received it the clip was only 2 inched long what was I soposto do with a 2 inch clip I through the product in the garbage can!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO HAD AN ADDITIONAL $4.00 SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEE I HAD TO PAY FOR AT THE DOOR! I FEEL THIS IS AGAINT FEDERAL REGULATED POSTAGE FEES, ISN&#x27;T SHIPPING CHARGED BY WEIGHT!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work no matter what I try.</li>
    <li> This is not made for all hair types as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this works if you have thin, fine hair. I have very, very thick hair and this will maybe accommodate 1/4 my hair.</li>
    <li> i expected a better quality but for the price i was accepting of the product. i would pay more for a better quality</li>
    <li> its is great but not for me I have too much hair and I could&#x27;nt wrap my hair around it or anything with it..so I giving to my niece,but I do recommend it for medium hair not for much or long hair.</li>
    <li> I have really long hair that reaches my tailbone, this product worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how so many people have said that this doesn&#x27;t work for them, you need to understand how to do this before you use this, I guess, before you try. This was so easy to use after a few goes to perfect, like anything. What I&#x27;m trying to say is that it is not an instant fix. It is designed to make it quicker to do than doing it alone. Granted, the instructions aren&#x27;t very clear...&lt;br /&gt;Got many compliments while wearing my hair like this with this product.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a Youtube tutorial online on how to do it if you search the product name!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a photo of how I managed to get my hair up.</li>
    <li> This thing is horrible and does NOT work as advertised. I&#x27;m pretty sure that if I took a crap in this box and returned it to the company they would not notice the product had changed and could also make a better french twist with what I sent them rather than whatever this clip thing they tried to make is.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past step 1 which was to secure the clip with your hair in it. The clip could not handle the amount of hair I have, even though I have thin, shoulder length hair. Don&#x27;t bother buying this. I can&#x27;t believe Conair/ Scunci sell this. Their other prodct I have (perfect pony) is fantastic.</li>
    <li> dont buy. not user friendly.</li>
    <li> I never could make a french twist but with the help of this item it only took minutes to make a perfect french twist and everyone loved it. The pagckaging was good and it got to me in time. I will purchase more items from this seller.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Quick &amp; Easy To Use! &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lies, all lies!!! Clip will not stay in place as it pops out as soon as I begin to roll my hair up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frustrating piece of....ya!!&lt;br /&gt;WORST product EVER!!&lt;br /&gt;Easier just to do a french twist with your hair than mess with this!!&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy!!! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> The whole idea behind this product is great.  Unfortunately, if you have thick or even medium thick hair, it will not work.  The barrette attached to the roller won&#x27;t snap shut.  I suppose you could roll it up without using the barrette part, however, that totally takes away from the French Wrap being and holding secure.</li>
    <li> Am 71 yrs old. Am growing hair out now.  Want to do Fr. Twist again like I did when young woman.  Intend to purchase a shaper like this soon, because I had one in past and used it with great results!  It&#x27;s very hard to find one nowadays so I am glad it&#x27;s sold here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if attached clip is good idea.  Will try it but remove it if not easy or successful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would be very hard to follow directions as presented on website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I used to do, will do in future, and which may be helpful to other customers:  1. Brush hair toward one side of head.  2. Affix shaper to scalp with long bobby pins inserted vertically, one at top and one up from bottom.  3. Brush hair toward other side.  4.  Wrap hair around shaper, starting at bottom, in sections, securing as you go with large hairpins along the fold line.  5.  At finish, at top of head, loop remaining hair around to form curl[s] and tuck ends into and under top of twist.  Use whatever size hairpins works for your type hair to secure this section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy and Beautiful!</li>
    <li> The clip&#x27;s metal pieces fit together perfectly when flush, however will not clip when any hair is added to the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unfortunate oversight makes the product a unusable.</li>
    <li> This item is horrible!  I have hair that is a little longer than shoulder length and layered to frame my face.  When I followed the directions, My hair did not stay in the clip at all and what little bit did, it looked awful.  I found this clip impossible to use any which way.  It may work for shorter hair that is not very fine, but also not too thick - I&#x27;m not sure though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this item to anyone!  Buyer beware of this item!</li>
    <li> Service was great!  The product did not.</li>
    <li> I agree with the majority of the reviews that say the clip is too flimsy. This could have been a great product if the designers had incorporated a better clip. I have very thin hair and it was impossible even for me to close the clip! I tried just putting in about half of my hair..... still would not work. Finally I got so frustrated, I took a pair of pliers and bent the clip out to make it wider to accommodate more hair, then I had to bend back the part that tucks into the clip so it would close. This took a fair amount of adjusting because I made it too wide the first time. Anyways, I got it to work and it looks pretty good, but this was waayyy to much work. CONAIR-PLEASE REDESIGN THIS PRODUCT WITH A BETTER CLIP!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was glad to see the other reviews about this product on Amazon.  I didn&#x27;t purchase on Amazon and it&#x27;s not worth my time to return.  I can&#x27;t believe that Conair is selling this.  I bought it because I thought they knew something about hair.  The product might be someone&#x27;s idea of a joke.  No matter how hard I tried, I could not get it to grasp even a small section of my hair. Ever who designed this, doesn&#x27;t know hair.</li>
    <li> This product was a WASTE of money! If your hair is thick and/or fine, it will not work for you. At ALL. It is super complicated to set up (takes several minutes, makes your arms tired), and then stays for less than half a minute!</li>
    <li> This device is very obviously for thin hair, hence it&#x27;s volumizing shape in the picture.  For women posting with thicker hair, try a foam chignon shaper. With some practice you can get awesome victory rolls, and French twists. Teasing and day old hair works best.</li>
    <li> Terrible.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Doesn&#x27;t work on medium thick straight hair at all, and don&#x27;t see how it could work on ANY hair anyway.  Worst product I&#x27;ve purchased in years.  Will be returning it.</li>
    <li> I agree with most of the other reviewers. I found this product very difficult to use. I could never get it to stay closed in my hair for more than 5 seconds, and then it just fell out. Also, the product is not usable for those with thick hair. I could not even get it to close using less than half of my hair. Slick hair also aids the hair to slide out. I would not recommend this product to anyone other than those with thin, highly textured hair.</li>
    <li> I have long, wavy, and very thick hair. This product works, but it takes a lot of practice. The clip is a little too small for me, but I was able to make it work. My hair is a couple inches past my shoulders, so if your hair is much longer than shoulder length, you will probably be frustrated. The way the clip is designed could use a little tweaking as well. It is very easy to clip it back after it has been unclipped when there is no hair in it, but because it is designed flat (no curve at all), as soon as there is even a little bit of hair in the clip, it is instantly the wrong shape for the clip to stay shut. This isn&#x27;t a matter of how much hair you put in there or how thick the hair is, the clip is simply the wrong shape to accommodate almost anything. Also, the clip feels a bit flimsy, and it is easy to bend it out of shape if you&#x27;re not careful. It is just as easy to get it back in the right shape, but I found that to be a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got the clip to stay shut and was able to make a decent french twist, but I had to modify the directions a bit. After I gathered my hair at the back of my head, I secured it with a hair elastic. Then, I smoothed my hair and clipped the clip at the bottom of my hair. There was absolutely no way I could get the clip to close at the top of my hair, so I skipped that step. It takes a bit of trial and error to find a place where the clip will stay closed. I find it works best to twist my pony tail so that the hair is compact, then fan the ends out into the clip. Keeping your hair relatively flat is the best way to get the clip to close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I rolled the clip to the top of my hair, smoothing as I went. I have a few layers, and I just let them fall out, then smoothed them underneath the rest of the hair as I rolled up. This is a bit hard to describe, but it is very easy to do. I found that when I got to the top, I had to rearrange and re-smooth some of the pieces of hair. There is always one piece that doesn&#x27;t want to stay if I roll, then pin, so I pinned as I went. I used the bobby pins in the package, then secured with spin pins. You need to put the bobby pins through your hair and make sure you secure them to the netting on the clip. I really recommend spin pins for a secure hold. There is no way that this clip will hold your hair on its&#x27; own, even if you use hair spray. Even if you have thin hair, you really need spin pins or a lot of bobby pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps to put a bit of gel in your hair and comb it through before you start rolling. You can make a decent looking french twist without the gel, but it is a lot easier to make it look neat if you use it. The gel also helps the shorter sections of hair stick together so they don&#x27;t fall out as easily and are easier to put back into place and have them stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this clip will work, but it takes practice. If you are like me and can&#x27;t do a french twist to save your life, this product might be worth a try. It is nowhere near as fast as the back of the box makes it look (it took me about 20 minutes from start to finish), but it will look decent. If you have thick hair or hair longer than shoulder length, this clip will probably not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great concept, but I don&#x27;t think Conair got it quite right. I gave it three stars because I eventually got it to work, and it&#x27;s the only way I have ever got my hair in a french twist that actually stayed, but it was a tad frustrating. All the problems were due to bad engineering and design. This could have been a great product, but it fell short. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad enough to not recommend it to anyone, but be aware that it doesn&#x27;t work for all hair types and you will have to practice a lot and do some trial and error to get it to work. I paid four dollars for this clip, and I think that&#x27;s about what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This product does not deserve one star. my hair is extremely thick can I could not even complete step two. it does not hold, and the clip does not close.</li>
    <li> This product is a joke. It took forever for me to get the flimsy little clip to close, and when I finally did, it immediately popped open again. And I have very fine hair. I can&#x27;t imagine how it could possibly work for someone with thick hair. In theory, this would be a really cool product, but it&#x27;s just too cheaply and poorly made. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of garbage.</li>
    <li> I cannot figure out how to get this to work but shall hang onto it until I do or find someone to give it to.  I am sure it is just me as I cannot claim I am by any stretch of the imagination a hairdresser...but love my hair dressed.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. the &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34; is very small and the clip to hold your hair is thin. it is very hard to clip the hair to the ends to begin with because there simply is not enough room to allow it. after struggling to clip it in , because the cone is tiny the hair falls out. my hair is a little below shoulder length so this is very unacceptable. I could see these issues with long hair by my hair is the perfect length. I didnt bother returning it, it costs more to ship this than what its worth. So i lost 2 dollars on it, just dont waste yours..</li>
    <li> I will preface this by saying my hair is pretty fine/thin. There is NO way I can get this clip to stay closed even with my meager hair, there is no way on earth anyone with normal or thick hair will get this clip to work. The design is poor and I actually wonder how they even got it to work long enough to photograph it on the model.</li>
    <li> The roller form does make a beautiful shape out of the hair, but the clip--which is paramount to any of it working--rarely holds.  Poor, poor design.&lt;br /&gt;As an alternative to this, try using a fat, wide barrette.</li>
    <li> The clip is so tiny, so thin, that I couldn&#x27;t even get my hair into it. I can&#x27;t imagine who they tested or designed this for -- babies? It might work well on a toddler with thin hair. I have literally never purchased anything this worthless or disappointing - wow!</li>
    <li> I bought this from Wal-Mart. I cannot even get this thing closed to even try to make a French twist. I will be returning mine.</li>
    <li> I wish i could give this Zero Stars. Awful awful AWFUL product.  I followed the intructions and tried multiple times to get this to work. The clip will NOT even close around your hair! Don&#x27;t bother. Such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Bought it, hate it, agree with another post - how did this ever get passed for sale to the unsuspecting? One word of advice if you are thinking about buying it: DON&#x27;T</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work, and it wouldn&#x27;t clip in. The one time I was able to clip it in my hair, it was so loose from the struggle that it looked terrible! It&#x27;s honestly easier to look at a YouTube video and do it yourself, then to use this. It&#x27;s the biggest waste of money! My hair is not that long and its been thinned, so I thought it would work. I have been doing hair for five years and this is the biggest scam I have ever come across.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair by any means and my hair is around my shoulders. I got this in hopes of using it when I went out for our wedding anniversary. I made sure to take it with me in the morning so I could play around with it so I could perfect it when I went out that night. I couldn&#x27;t even get the clip to close. I figured it was because my hair was still a little wet and wavy. When I got home, I spent about 30-45 mins straightening my hair to thin it out and hope to get it to work. Still nothing. I ended up going out with my hair down because I couldn&#x27;t get the stupid thing to close. It&#x27;s going back....</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair, so you&#x27;d think this would work well.  I gave up after about twenty frustrating tries.  The little clip arm won&#x27;t stay shut, so when you try to roll up your hair it pops open and all of your hair falls out.  Also, most women have layered hair and/or a round head, so it&#x27;s impossible to follow the directions on the back of the box (secure clip and pull down to within a few inches of the tips of your hair?  Right.).  I don&#x27;t know how this kind of junk gets manufactured and how it makes it onto the shelves.</li>
    <li> I might as well have used a $5 bill to roll up my hair with - it would work better, and I&#x27;d still have the $5 when I took my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought mine at Fred Meyer&#x27;s. I wish I had seen it on Amazon first, and seen the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this useless piece of crap.</li>
    <li> The clip won&#x27;t stay in the locked position.  Thus, making it impossible to keep the cone in place as I wrap it into a French twist.  I was completely exasperated with the who thing and threw it into the garbage after twenty attempts.</li>
    <li> It is too small so it won&#x27;t grab all my hair. I have tried to put it on several times &amp; I have not been successful.</li>
    <li> Way too small, about the size of a man&#x27;s thumb. Can&#x27;t really do much with something that tiny.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this today and was excited to try it for the holidays. The damn thing doesn&#x27;t even stay cliped! And I don&#x27;t even have thick hair. It&#x27;s like way too small. When I realized It wasn&#x27;t going to work because my hair didn&#x27;t fit on the twist, I tried to only do a half up french twist like the pic on the box and even that didn&#x27;t work!! Don&#x27;t waste your money or time!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to use this however the clip that holds your hair was way too small.  Returning it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m angry that I spent money on this. The package claims that it&#x27;s for all hair types, but I have fairly thick hair, and the clip simply refused to close. I tried to work around that and clipe my hair at the ends, but that only results in a lumpy, uneven hairdo. Please don&#x27;t waste your cash like I did.</li>
    <li> This clip is nothing but a Kegel formed curler with a thin barette-like snap which simply is not strong enough to hold your hair (maybe if you&#x27;ve very thin hair.) the idea is great but the product is not solid and strong enough to hold hair</li>
