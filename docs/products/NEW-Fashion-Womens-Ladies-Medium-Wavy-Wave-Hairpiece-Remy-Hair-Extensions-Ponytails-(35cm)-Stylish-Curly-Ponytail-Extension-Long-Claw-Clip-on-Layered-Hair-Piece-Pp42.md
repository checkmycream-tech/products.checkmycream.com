    <li> I ordered dark brown and it was a lighter auburn. It also looked fake. I have many hair pieces (real hair and synthetic), extensions pony tails and scrunchy ones. Some are cheaper some are more expensive ones. Price doesn&#x27;t always mean cheap and fake looking, but in this case it does.</li>
    <li> It went right in the trash. Color was off. Wasn&#x27;t the same hair. Big rip off.</li>
    <li> Way too heavy to wear. It also has a strange thick loop cord hanging out of the top of clip. Very odd design that will ever be worn.</li>

    <li> color was way off I ordered dark brown and it is very light  cant use it at all and didn&#x27;t want the bother of sending it back. I guess the color needs to be black.</li>
