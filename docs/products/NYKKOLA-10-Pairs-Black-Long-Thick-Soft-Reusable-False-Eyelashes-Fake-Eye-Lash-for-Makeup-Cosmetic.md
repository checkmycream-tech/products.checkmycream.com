<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The band seems too thick.  Have a hard time getting them to stick compared to all my other sets of lashes. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> For those who buy these bulk lashes please note that I learned you have to remove the threading from the outside of the band for them to stick properly and have a more than one time use.  If you want a more natural look you remove the last piece of thread for a one time use. Other than that they&#x27;re great for the price!!</li>
    <li> I liked them a lot but the packed was pretty messed up ! Also I had to buy a new eyelash glue</li>
    <li> Very very thin and feels like plastic haven&#x27;t put them on yet though wish me luck</li>
    <li> i thought this were going to look like real eye lashes, however they look very cheap and very much like thick plastic</li>
    <li> They are very tough , do not bend for nothing</li>
    <li> These lashes are terrible! They look NOTHING like the picture!!</li>
    <li> Material of lashes suck , wtf is this , plastic?</li>
    <li> good price but SOOOO stiff.  hard to work with</li>
    <li> Great lashes for the price! Had to trim them but really good</li>
    <li> No bueno. I do not like them I doubt I&#x27;ll even wear them. They look nothing like they do on the pictures. But they where cheap so whatever.</li>
    <li> VERY natural looking, and I just love, love, love these eyelashes!!!  I purchased several boxes for both my sister and myself, and we&#x27;re VERY happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely awful, the lashes are plastic, not sift at all. Packaging was broken bent and torn apart. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Eehhhhh there cute I just don&#x27;t like the band I hate it it&#x27;s very thick hard to apply if your a beginner</li>
    <li> A bit longer than I antisipated but Nice quality for price payed</li>
    <li> I am newer to wearing lashes, and I got these along with a few others to try a variety. I got these, Ardell 110s, and some from Taobaopit. These are about the same length as Ardell 110s, but twice, maybe three times as thick. They are stiffer than the other lashes I have tried, very dark, and have a stiffer band. I hesitated to only give 3 stars just because they weren&#x27;t what *I* was looking for, but again they are pretty stiff - both the band and the actual lashes. These would be obvious from across the room, I would imagine you&#x27;d only use them for a night out in very dim lighting, or if you just prefer dramatic lashes. If you are looking for lashes that are anything along the lines of blendable (to your natural lashes) or subtle in any degree these are not the lashes for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would compare these to the higher numbered Ardell&#x27;s (117, 118, 120) in visibility and thickness, but stiffer since Ardell is made with human hair - although the stiffness would probably mean durability for several reuses if you do like the thicker, longer lashes.</li>
    <li> these lashes are good. I don&#x27;t get a full week out of them like my others. they are not too long or full.</li>
    <li> Really beautiful product, but the little band that you use to attach them to your eyes was way to thick, looked really costumey.</li>
    <li> Not Wat I Expected Dont Like Them At All !  They Don&#x27;t Look Anything Like In The Picture</li>
    <li> These look nothing like the picture. You get what you pay for, cheap and plasticy. Not happy, feel like dollar store quality.</li>
    <li> did not like them didnt seem like the picture</li>
    <li> In the picture they look like they&#x27;re going to be nicely curved and look long. When I took one out it had a little extension of the band on both sides, so I cut it off. I tried measuring them on myself but it was so straight and not curved at all that it was a hassle to measure. I ended up cutting nearly a third of it because these things are so huge.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly not something I would ever purchase again. Better off buying a multipack from Ardell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give zero stars if I could. These lashes are not as advertised!! I bought some before and they were amazing. I wanted to order them again and the ones I got were awful. I might as well throw them out!!</li>
    <li> Not what the picture showed. They don&#x27;t even look real they are plastic. I was disappointed. But you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love these lashes ! They are plastic but for me they are better they can get wet you can lay on them without them messing up I also had to cut the ends just a tad to fit  , but they look natural as well! It&#x27;s a great buy trust me.</li>
    <li> I love the product,  they are over exaggerated but that&#x27;s what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> What a rip off ! Do not buy!!!  You will be better off buying some from the dollar tree .</li>
    <li> worst eyelashes ever !!! you cant even wear them the glue wont stay on them</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re literally Plastic. Wouldn&#x27;t even wear them for Halloween.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste! The lashes are like rubber. They look like something you would glue on a toy and they feel like rubber. As soon as I opened the package and observed them I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> These lashes are very natural and full</li>
    <li> They look plastic-y but look natural on. They are great and easy to grip!!</li>
    <li> came faster than expected! thanks, i love them!</li>
    <li> The eyelashes I received did not look the same at the picture.</li>
    <li> Their good qual some are just smaller than others</li>
    <li> These lashes are amazing I love how they are not s full but can easily blend in with your own lashes. They are very light weight and comfortable with that extra band to help blend with your natural lash line. I love the quality of them they do not feel cheap or poorly made. These lashes are durable and can be reused over and over again.</li>
    <li> Got mine today and tried them right away. I love them! They give me the volume I wanted. Great buy 😊 Could be packaged a little better though .</li>
    <li> Lashes u could tell they were fake look like plastic</li>
    <li> the lashes are a great price, and work great, i do spfx makeup and these work great for dolls, i can use fabric paint to color them, i did some red some blue. they stack well to make them look thicker. sadly, my package came crushed, the box too, its okay, nothing was hurt</li>
    <li> They are a little thicker and longer than expected but it came super early and they were super cheap! I always buy my lashes on Amazon. Very happy customer</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like these lashes</li>
    <li> The lashes looked nothing like the picture...false advertisement!!!!!</li>
    <li> Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk. Junk.</li>
    <li> I particularly did not care for these lashes, one reason is due to them being plastic.  They are not soft, and they&#x27;re uncomfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> They were plastic &amp; hard to put on. Honestly I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> These were not exactly what i expected, but they&#x27;re decent. Especially for the price. The texture is more like hard synthetic hair rather than soft real hair. Once I cut them and put them on and coated with mascara, they didn&#x27;t look or feel any different than other false lashes. I will order these again.</li>
    <li> I love Amazon.com and I ship frequently,  I just Jaye the fact I can&#x27;t get a credit card.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: Not real hair, like pieces of black plastic</li>
    <li> I received mine a few days before expected delivery date but they do not look like the picture. You get what you paid for. They look really unnatural and plastic. I hope they look different on my eye.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Plastic pieces put on a band. You definitely get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
    <li> They are crisscrossed lashes and look nothing like the pictur . They are also extremely stiff!</li>
    <li> I like in jersey . Not a thing to dislike about this product . Very affordable . Good investment I will gladly buy more in the near future ! 😍💳</li>
    <li> These lashes look very plastic and I haven&#x27;t used them yet. The package was a bit beat up.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok for practice but not to wear out . They have extra stripping on them that makes them uncomfortable &amp; look unnatural .</li>
    <li> Not good. Cheap looking plastic</li>
    <li> nice look but not all the same length, gotta try to match sets from the lot, good price but again not all same sizes</li>
    <li> Horrible ! Made of paper</li>
    <li> Great! Just what i was looking for with an afforable price.</li>
    <li> I bought these, hoping for a thinner, more natural look for my wedding. They&#x27;re nice, but probably for someone who likes them a bit thicker than me. They&#x27;re just not what I thought they were.</li>
    <li> Was not what what I expected. I&#x27;m currently working on a TV show doing makeup- that is what I bought the lashes for. It looked like the photo was of &amp;#34;Demi wisps&amp;#34; a lash that is a lot fuller and looks more like a natural lash than what arrived in the mail. The lashes that I got in the mail have a cross hair pattern that isn&#x27;t a lash I can use on my clients. The band is thick, you will need to hold the lash to the eye for a while when applying. Other than that, they&#x27;re a great price for those who wear lashes everyday and like this pattern.</li>
    <li> very good quality they look natural for a very cheap price all false lashes lovers well be very satisfied :)</li>
    <li> I Would not recomend these ever! First they are not what i expected ! They look wierd ! Like fish nets and are stiff ! Very bad 0 stars! I Would not get these if i where u ...</li>
    <li> I dont know what eyelashes the bad reviewers got, but the ones i recieved are gorgeous. I bought the Ardell &amp;#34;curvy&amp;#34; lashes that are similar to this design and they do not compare AT ALL to the beauty of these lashes. And it is a great deal. I think these are the greatest lashes i have tried in a while. And they look incredibly natural. I am so pleased.</li>
    <li> They are light,  airy &amp; beautiful.  Ordering more now.</li>
    <li> I thought they&#x27;d be more lash like. They&#x27;re VERY plastic looking. haven&#x27;t worn them yet but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll be to my liking. They look feathery in the picture but are like plastic lines crisscrossing in reality.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t look much like the one in the pictures. The one I received is way more spread apart than the one in the picture. I won&#x27;t use them as they don&#x27;t look good.</li>
    <li> they feel like pastic, i thought they would be like the ones in the stores. im afraid to wear them.</li>
    <li> Awesome lashes ♡ Not too long not too short just perfect for me :-)</li>
    <li> These were terrible quality. Not buying again</li>
    <li> they are heavier than the human lashes.</li>
    <li> These eye lashes are not what i expected...</li>
    <li> They felt and looked like plastic. They would not go on properly. I tossed two brand new boxes out. Garbage! I&#x27;d rather get my lashes from Wal-Mart!</li>
    <li> I read other reviews on these lashes after inpurchased them and realized that the lashes that are sent are not always the same ones. I only bought these because they were dirt cheap and I am just learning about applying fake lashes, so I wanted a tester bunch to start out with before I purchase expensive ones. These lashes are a joke, but I didn&#x27;t expect anything extraordinary.</li>
    <li> They feel and look like plastic</li>
    <li> These are some very nice fake eyelashes. I just would have wished it came with the glue is all I would suggest but the lashes themselves are a good quality for costume ideas. I purchased this at a discounted rate for my honest review and I can honestly say these will come in handy when we are going out for the next party or Halloween dress up. These I wouldn&#x27;t suggest for everyday use as they are very &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34; looking but very nice either way. I will be purchasing more for my personal use.</li>
    <li> Plastic like, but they work well when you double them</li>
    <li> These lashes are horrible I WOULD NOT recommend no one to purchase them. They&#x27;re thick and looks like to many fibers on the lash</li>
    <li> Really nice quality!! Great price.</li>
    <li> Love these thick lashes</li>
    <li> Delivered on time but when I opened these lashes I laughed and then cried. What on earth are these lashes made of. They look super fake. I know it&#x27;s not worth returning so I&#x27;ll just trash em. Seller needs to take this crap down ASAP !!!</li>
    <li> These are so thick and plastic looking, they&#x27;ve just been sitting in my makeup bag since I got them. I&#x27;ll never wear these unless I have a Halloween costume that requires drag queen esque eye makeup. If you&#x27;re looking for subtle or natural (or even tasteful, really) these are not the lashes for you. But hey, maybe you&#x27;re into that kind of thing. Regardless, be wary of the chea[p quality.</li>
    <li> Very cheap quality, they were more like dress up/Halloween lashes... Good if your just learning</li>
    <li> I love these lashes! I love how they open up my eyes, and how little mascara I have to use on them because they already spread out wonderfully. I been looking for the type of lashes that I wanted to continue to use forever basically, and I found it. The seller service is very good, they are very polite to your requests and respect you. 5/5!</li>
    <li> Great and dramatic for the price!</li>
    <li> I love false eye lashes, and these are by far my favorite falsies yet. I only buy these now. They look full and natural. I love them.</li>
    <li> The lash strip was very heavy causing the lash to lift through out the day</li>
    <li> not very nice looking but they are good lashes otherwise</li>
    <li> i always want to try fake eye lashes i buy this and the are ok and they look good they are to dark but with a good black liner they look fabulous arrived on time</li>
    <li> they look different in person .. oh well</li>
    <li> At first I was excited, but once I saw them and it&#x27;s quality I was very disappointed. The eye lashes look to plastic.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected!!</li>
    <li> Fake hair. It makes your eyes itchy. Takes forever to put on. Everything about these eyelashes are just a mess!</li>
    <li> Package was a little beat up but lashes were fine and look awesome applied. Especially when doubled up</li>
    <li> These lashes suck! They deff look like they cost a dollar. I guess I got what I paid for. So cheap and the lashes dont even go in the same direction. They&#x27;re so ugly!!</li>
    <li> The quality is really bad.</li>
    <li> This was my first amazon purchase. Have since had sevever others. They&#x27;re okay. It took them forever to get here and when they did the come the box was crushed and destroyed.The envolope looked like it had been jumped on.&lt;br /&gt;Dont expect the best quality lashes either.  They get the job done though, I guess. You get what you pay for so I cant really complain.  Worth the price.</li>
    <li> they look really great, nice dark full lashes and not too fake looking! i would recommend. easy to bend so they go right on without a problem.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. The eyelashes felt too delicate. The material that was made from sucks. Now I&#x27;m stuck with 3 boxes. Not worth buying</li>
    <li> Lashes suck they r not the ones in the picture!!!</li>
    <li> Bought these lashes thinking they were going to be long and thick and they turned out to be the complete opposite. They were super thin and so short my natural lashes are longer definantly not worth the money.</li>
    <li> These had a couple okay reviews so I thought I&#x27;d try them and no just no.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it was going to be they are very thin</li>
    <li> No way in hell it looked natural. Looks Way too plastic.... Could of bought better eyelashes from a dollar store!</li>
    <li> Love...love...love them</li>
    <li> These are too stiff to wear.</li>
    <li> This is worst fake eye lashes i ever had. 1st they are total straight, no anatomic curve, looks very funny. 2nd this eye lashes are heavy and super rigid. I could use them only for Halloween party.</li>
    <li> Sucked. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Doesn&#x27;t even stay on the eyes and the bottom of it is so hard and stabs your eyelid.</li>
    <li> I am new to wearing lashes so imagine my surprise when this came in box with no glue or instructions for someone like me who is not used to using this type of product, I was expecting at the minimum at least a suggestion as to what type of glue to use. Maybe a picture or something. they are stiff and they look plastic not very appealing. so for me this is not realy up my alley</li>
    <li> Came late, look plastic,didn&#x27;t come with glue. Well it&#x27;s kind of my fault for not asking if it came with glue. But it doesn&#x27;t have a natural look even with mascara. I had to put a thick layer of eyeliner on to make it look right.</li>
    <li> I have not worn them yet but I can tell it will be great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they look when worn because I haven&#x27;t done so yet but I was surprised to see that these lashes are plastic not hair or synthetic fibers.</li>
    <li> Crappy and cheap. Should have known</li>
    <li> looked a little too fake and wouldnt glue as good</li>
    <li> It comes with the extended sides so you can cut it to the shape of your eye. I love them . My order came a week earlier than expected. It put them on today and I gotten great compliments I will be ordering again .</li>
    <li> Love them when thin the look so much more natural love them!</li>
    <li> Horrible. Cheap. Doesnt even look like eyelashes. I just threw them away</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way they feel on my eyes, and I am not real sure why.</li>
    <li> The are ok, no what i was expecting</li>
    <li> I love these. Yes they look very fake &amp; plastic like in the container but I love them when they&#x27;re on! They are gorgeous for some lash glam at night time. Heck I&#x27;ve even worn em in the day time! I wear lashes every day and have many different brands, types &amp; lengths and these were one of my favs :) hope this takes away from some of the awful reviews I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> very odd pattern on lash</li>
    <li> Look as if the are made of plastic really unrealistic</li>
    <li> They are cheep and look horrible, don&#x27;t order!</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T Buy , these ugly lashes .</li>
    <li> They are so plastic looking. And don&#x27;t come in the same package shown. Not a happy customer over here.</li>
    <li> These look NOTHING like the picture, they are a thick plastic and are poorly made to boot. These are a waste of money. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> i am not sure what &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; these are but its more like rubberized string... not a good buy!</li>
    <li> What can I say that I haven&#x27;t already! Oh, They always send a different brand. they aren&#x27;t exactly what you see in the picture. I have been ordering these for about a year and I always go back to my orders and click &amp;#34;re-order&amp;#34; but each time a get a slightly different set of lashes. They aren&#x27;t horribly different but different all the same. This isn&#x27;t a complaint just a observance. I will continue to be a regular buyer because I love them.</li>
    <li> The strip line needs to be trimmed before applying but they look great for glam makeup.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re wondering if you should buy them or not, you definitely should. They are so beutiful and they look extremely natural. I would repurchase.</li>
    <li> Coming from a professional makeup artist looking for deals, these are pretty good. Bend the band when you&#x27;re about to put them on because the band comes pretty stiff. Packaging could be a bit neater for organization, but it doesnt matter too much when it comes down to the lashea. That&#x27;s my only complaint! Great for frequent wear.</li>
    <li> Just got my eyelashes, the box was all tore up and smashed &amp; the eyelashes weren&#x27;t damaged but they look nothing like the picture they feel like plastic</li>
    <li> These lashes are it what the picture shows. They look plastic. The packaging also is not what it appears to be . What do you expect for buying cheap</li>
    <li> Their great for that price!</li>
    <li> These are not what I expected. I am new to eyelashes so they maybe okay but the quality seemed low and they do not look real at all.</li>
    <li> They feel like plastic.</li>
    <li> Does not look like real lashes. Seemed plastic looking</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good deal for anyone who wears lashes all the time</li>
    <li> i bought these because they were cheep and i just wanted to see if it was worth it but they seem so fake its not even really worth it to me to use them. they are very stiff.</li>
    <li> They feel and look like plastic and are very cheap in appearance while on. Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get to me even when I paid for expediting!!! Once they came, not worth it. Too cheap.</li>
    <li> Great eyelash quality</li>
    <li> Horrible product they are made of plastic and they don&#x27;t even stick to your eye. I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for, cheap!</li>
    <li> The eyelashes are too hard and they feel heavy on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> These eyelashes are a tad bit stiff and they have a spaced out alignment but they are perfect for my cosmetology doll heads !! If you are purchasing them for personal use id suggest buying eyelashes somewhere else !</li>
    <li> They are so ugly and look like a prostitute&#x27;s eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I really love these lashes! Don&#x27;t listen to the hate! I mean 2 bucks for good lashes and when your done you can throw them out! Be real! They are amazing!👌🏻</li>
    <li> These eye lashes are great ,very easy to apply and they makes your eyes look 100% natural.</li>
    <li> These lashes are gorg! I got them in the mail later then the expected date but it was worth it. They&#x27;re thick and long and dramatic for photos or a night out to a lounge or bar. But I wouldn&#x27;t suggest them for daily wear. Maybe if your on vacation or a night out with the girls these lashes are perfect. Downside is that their a little heavy. Besides that their literally like mink lashes</li>
    <li> They are ok but do not look natural</li>
    <li> when i ordered these i thought they would look like the picture!! they did not and they are very heavy and ugly eyelashes!</li>
    <li> These are beyond the most terrible lashes EVER!!!! So uncomfortable to wear. Put them on once and threw them in the trash.</li>
    <li> Love the lashes, there really soft and real looking, I guess that why I bought 6 more pairs. Plus the price compare to store prices, can&#x27;t beat it. I will definitely buy all my lashes from here.</li>
    <li> These are waaay too long for me! The band is fine and the quality of the lashes is fine too, but the style just doesn&#x27;t suit my eyes at all. They&#x27;re not natural in the least, but if you want something dramatic then these will be perfect for you!</li>
    <li> They were damaged both boxes</li>
    <li> THEY ARENT NATURAL LOOKING EYELASHES ... They also look waaaay better in the picture :/</li>
    <li> What I got in the mail like  you pay for what you get  Also verry cheap looking</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my daughters dance team and got them today😡this ugly plastic crap.This is how it was when i opened it!Save your money</li>
    <li> Came a week early and I love them. Bought glue before hand and that was a good idea, didn&#x27;t come with any.</li>
    <li> They are alright. Thick but look moderately realistic. Definitely need a little trimming, but well worth the $1.82!</li>
    <li> I bought them for bottom lashes for a doll costume. They looked nice- even though they were not the same lashes that were pictured. The lashes I received were criss-cross lashes, but for my purpose it worked. They were pretty stiff and straight, but again I used them for a doll costume so it gave the look we were going for.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. like they say you get what you pay for. Super plastic looking no kind of natural look to them at all. Also you have to pretty much use lash glue to get them to stay properly. Maybe it miss read but i thought they where already lined with adhesive.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected???</li>
    <li> I just received mine today &amp;the packaging is the worst ever. I purchase eyelashes from amazon all the time &amp;never have I received such bad quality packaging. &amp;yes the lashes look very plastic like &amp;stiff ,but you have to remove the one of the bands. It has 2,hold the lash &amp;pull on the band like if your taking off the glue. It will make them a lot softer &amp;easier to put on &amp;are not as bad. Just be careful not to pull to hard. But Anyway!! Can I get new ones sent?? Mine look like they stepped on then before sending them to me,wth?</li>
    <li> They were not what I expected them to be</li>
    <li> Love these lashes. They last and easy application..</li>
    <li> They are not what is being advertised.  They are plastic and not full like the picture. I was highly dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> ❤💛💚💙💜THEM, THEY ARE KINDA LONG BUT I JUST CURLED. THEM WITH A EYE LASH CURLER AND THEY LOOK BETTER</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I ordered, and I was a little worried because a lot of people had put negative reviews, saying they were plastic and hard to wear. I just recevied them, I haven&#x27;t worn them yet but I&#x27;ve looked at them, definitely not plastic. For what I payed for, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re just fine :)</li>
    <li> Love love love these lashes , very dramatic and natural looking at the same time love them, buying more as we speak</li>
    <li> I received my lashes today. . was super excited.  And I got exactly what I paid for CRAP!!! There is nothing soft about these lashes . . there is no way I can wear these.  There plastic  ugh to good to be true . ..</li>
    <li> The lash line is white and not flexible they keep popping off the corners.</li>
    <li> So disappointed the eyelashes look nothing like the picture as described! Looks cheap and poorly made. Other than that package was shipped earlier than expected</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with these lashes, it looks like plastic and does not look good. I would never buy this type of lashes again.</li>
    <li> these are the best!!!!! natural lashes, i bought 3 boxes and now buying 3 more, there very full and so real looking the band is think for the glue to hold but also thin so i cant tell there not real.the down part the boxes are so thin the get crushed in shipping , they just new to package them better but other then that these lashes are great!!!! if you dont like these you dont know how to put them on??? GREAT BUY!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> They took a long time to get here but worth the wait for me.. 💕💕💜</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time. The lashes are very flexible and fit all shaped eyes. They look like human hair lashes and if they are to tin the weft is thin enough where you can put two pairs on at a time.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected they are all messed up and very low quality!!</li>
    <li> You like plastic eyelashes</li>
    <li> For the price, nothing better.</li>
    <li> The lashes are horrible never ordering again</li>
    <li> Last forever , same type lashes . I had to double them though</li>
    <li> I never had a problem with these lashes.  I especially love the way I can cut them to fit, i have fairly large eyes and most pre-cut lashes stop to short.  I love love love  them!</li>
    <li> These eyelashes were the worst!!! They were messed up</li>
    <li> They fill in eyelashes nicely, good for any make up look!</li>
    <li> ya, my lashes did not look anything like the picture, in fact they were ugly and VERY fake looking, will never buy again, I guess you get what you pay for though also, it took 2 months for it to arrive so you have to be patient</li>
    <li> Okay now these are bar. I love them. I have to fill the white part in with my liquid eyeliner and you should not purchase if you don&#x27;t have experience with lash cause they&#x27;re a Lil hard to work with since they are threaded. Above all they are my new favorite</li>
    <li> They cut into my eyelids and were sharp.</li>
    <li> These are for costume uses ONLY. Very odd looking plastic eyelashes.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Awful.  If they are not plastic, the look like plastic.</li>
    <li> Look great and natural</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about them, they looked very cheap. But after I did my make up and applied them, they looked amazing. I get compliments and many people ask where I bought them. Ordering more soon.  💕</li>
    <li> I just received mine today. Took 11 days to get here. The lashes are OK but look really fake,  not natural at all. I would rather buy eyelashes in Walmart to be honest.</li>
    <li> They came as expected</li>
    <li> Best lashes I&#x27;ve payed for 😍 in loveeee!</li>
    <li> Really cheap material.</li>
    <li> They are very durable, I love them</li>
    <li> These lashes are thinner than the thin ones i order</li>
    <li> no adhesive how am i supposed to put them on!</li>
    <li> These were a waist of money as well ! Bought them for nothing</li>
    <li> Horrible!! Feels and look fake, will never order again.</li>
    <li> Great and long lasting</li>
    <li> They r small n they look so fake</li>
    <li> When I received these eyelashes I was shocked to see they were pretty much made out of plastic.</li>
    <li> Shipping took awhile, but the price and product is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes are very pretty. Other than my mail person bending up my box, my box was not. The band on the lashes are quite long n straight so you pretty much have to clip the band and how the lashes are installed in the box the corner of the lashes sort of bend to the inner corner. They&#x27;re kind of like a pair of Salon Perfect I&#x27;ve had jus without the extra piece on the end of the lash and  the lashes kind of look plastic but i can work with that but other than that they&#x27;re still pretty.</li>
    <li> I love them they are cute but sometimes can be itchy</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t liked them 😔</li>
    <li> Ehhhh i wouldn&#x27;t buy these again. I&#x27;ll just spend the extra couple bucks for better lashes.</li>
    <li> They are nothing like the picture and they aren&#x27;t that great</li>
    <li> These are pretty similar to their description so I&#x27;d advise those looking to purchase them to read it. They are thick, long and dramatic! The thickness of the band and the lashes are perfect for those who plan on reusing them. They are a tiny bit dramatic for every day use (I still wear them but I could see how others would not) but are perfect for date night, a night out, or for those who like heavier makeup. I only gave them 4/5 stars because the stiffness of the band requires a few uses before they really bend to your eye shape.</li>
    <li> Product is as expected.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes great quality for the price</li>
    <li> I got a product that looked nothing like the picture. Terrible quality and very disappointed!</li>
    <li> They look every fake but just put mascara over it and it looked fine</li>
    <li> Was not soft  felt like plastic.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST BUYS EVER! WELL MADE, BEAUTIFUL TO&lt;br /&gt;LOOK AT AND THE PERFECT FULLNESS AND NEEDED AMOUNT OF HAIRS&lt;br /&gt;TO SUIT MY FANCY. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I am going to use this in my photo pictures with ideas I have and it will be interested....  Thank you very much......</li>
    <li> These eyelashes were horrible. The shipping took forever the packaging g was horrible and the eyelashes themselves are hideous. I threw them away as soon as I got them.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all.......... didn&#x27;t like the eyelashes!!</li>
    <li> If I could give negative stars I would, at last I am in search of great eye lashes I had purchased from Amazon. They were great, soft and looked amazing. These are terrible, they are STIFF, have a WHITE band on the base of the eyelash and are difficult to apply. I would not purchase these again, my search continues. (Yes I&#x27;ve tried re-ordering the nice lashes I had, however that vendor seems to have changed their inventory).</li>
    <li> These are great.  They come from out of the country so it took like 2 weeks to get here...but o well.....it is all about the happiness.  Does not come with glue and I did think that these would be longer. They are comfortable and I love them.</li>
    <li> They looked plastic and were hard to put on</li>
    <li> Am in love with them might order more. Shipping does take a couple of weeks but hey it&#x27;s free shipping so I wouldn&#x27;t mind waiting</li>
    <li> they feel very light and natural! not like others you can feel them really heavly on your lids.. and i love the way they look!</li>
    <li> These have to be labeled as toys they are ridiculously no good .. They look like plastic bottom line fake looking as in plastic hard and no good.</li>
    <li> These are plastic, they don&#x27;t even shape down with glue. Worse purchase ever</li>
    <li> THEY HAVE SOME TYPE OF WHITE LINE WHERE YOU PUT THE GLUE AT AND IT SHOWS UP AND STANDS OUT WHEN I HAVE THEM ON</li>
    <li> These were horrrible and  so fake looking you can tell thier straight  pieces of plastic 😑 ima stick to human hair ones. Never buying these again .. I literally just threw them away  once i got them</li>
    <li> Came with no lashes glue</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THESE!!!!!!!!!  I should have read the reviews. These are ugly! They look nothing the picture. I swear the people who give this more than 2 stars you are lying to everyone who&#x27;s trying to find good looking eyelashes. I&#x27;m telling you women DON&#x27;T BUY THEM!!!!!! They are so cheap looking. I&#x27;ve bought some a year a go through a different seller thinking the seller sold what it actually looks like. Nope I was so wrong! I don&#x27;t even want to give them a star.</li>
    <li> Not noticeable when wearing it</li>
    <li> Heavy and very fake !</li>
    <li> perfect perfect perfect ! they look exactly like the picture and they are super long and full (i hate the lashes are really short since my eyes are kinda big i need wider lashes and i love the fullness and length) they look amazing on as well this is now my new go to lash seller ! lolzz</li>
    <li> Great lashes and a thin comfortable band. Very well made.</li>
    <li> They were a little thinner than I expected, but they feel comfortable after trimming them to size. They look decent once applied.</li>
    <li> Best eyelashes I personally ever bought.  Has a more wired line so you can actually fit them to your lash line not as flimsy as the store bought ones.  They are light weight and hold all day and don&#x27;t give you the tired eye feeling you get when you wear lashes all day.  The length I had to trim a lil but they truly give you the superstar sex kittens look</li>
    <li> They are a good length, but the band where the eyelash glue was too thick of a band.also, it was hard to put on because of the thick band. They were very plasticky. They itched horribly so I took them off. I recommend the Ardelle 105 lashes they are softer and so weightless!</li>
    <li> The lashes are not the ones in the picture! I was sent a pair that I don&#x27;t even like and am not even going to wear. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> excellent product and 100% reliable</li>
    <li> I bought two boxes of these but I have trouble finding any that fit the length of my eyelid.</li>
    <li> The lashes in the picture were not the lashes I receive. I need lashes that look as real as possible since I have cancer and my lashes are falling ou. The ones I received are criss cross.</li>
    <li> feels creepy to put on because its plastic..</li>
    <li> Cheaply made; inferior materials. Tried to bend them a few times to loosen up for application, and the individual lashes bent and clumped without me even touching them. Tried to cut off an edge (as suggested) in order to fit them to my eye- and the individual lashes on the other side clumped and tangled. Just super poor quality all around- and they look incredibly fake, like they were made with waxed thread or something. Lashes are individually too thick for authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely okay if your kid is like 12 and wants to play dress up- but not for adults, and certainly not for me.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Didn&#x27;t come with glue and they don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> Good item for right price</li>
    <li> I love them. Very dramatic but can be trimmed into different styles with patience. A little plasticity but otherwise they are perfect.</li>
    <li> LASHES LOOK VERY VERY FAKE!!!!</li>
    <li> These lashes were not of good quality and looked terribly fake. They took forever to get delivered in a small envelope from China. I couldn&#x27;t give them away and I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> I received my lashes and I love them.</li>
    <li> Slow shipping but just as described</li>
    <li> these lashes look natural yet full the band is stiff like others are saying but you just have to play with them before putting them on. Having a stiffer band means that the lashes are easier to clean and more durable compared to other lashes with a thread like band those get damaged easily when you clean them. Overall i really like these lashes I think are a great deal and worth a try!</li>
    <li> There not all that great, its cheap and looks the part</li>
    <li> These things are so fake feeling and dont even stay on and when they do very uncomfortable wouldn&#x27;t reccomond anyone buying these</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even bother... This is the kind used on dolls</li>
    <li> These were awful lashes. They went in the garbage. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money on these.</li>
    <li> Cheap, not bendable, doesn&#x27;t blend, unrealistic look.</li>
    <li> 3 stars.. don&#x27;t get me wrong, these are beautiful lashes. I really loved them. The reason why I give them a 3 instead of a 5 is because... they arrived to me all squished and the box in which the were stored was ripped. Some lashes I had to throw away because they were bent and they didn&#x27;t look good when I put them on....BUT besides that, for the price, they are Amazing:) I wear them almost everyday, because I have very tiny and sparse lashes, and at least for me and my eye shape they look natural. Give them a try, for only a couple buck you get 10 pairs of lashes...worth the investment:)</li>
    <li> I thought they would be longer but they aren&#x27;t that bad.</li>
    <li> Love these lashes! Looks natural on.</li>
    <li> They were not what i expected! Too thick and hard to work with.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get them, and they are plastic..like doll lashes, and they do not stay on.</li>
    <li> Good, very long, I had to cut ✂ them to fit my eye shape but not a whole lot.</li>
    <li> cheap,cheap,cheap&lt;br /&gt;dont waste your time ordering these lashes</li>
    <li> They are nothing like the picture</li>
    <li> They come off very easily very disappointed because I was looking forward to good quality lashe</li>
    <li> Great plastic lashes for a great price. Do not buy if you don&#x27;t like plastic lashes. Otherwise, they&#x27;re great!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re nice but it&#x27;s difficult apply :(&lt;br /&gt;And They&#x27;re so long that you can see too dramatic</li>
    <li> These lashes are not natural looking at all. The fibers criss cross back and forth with rather large gaps in between each strand.  They look completely different in the photo then when they arrive.  The packing is similar, but the package that I got had Chinese writing all over it.  I will not be using these, even though I have waited over a month for them to arrive.</li>
    <li> I am learning with these. Once you get them on they look beautiful... But getting them on is tricky. I bought a different glue so I am hoping it helps. I was using duo with the applicator brush and I should say that I am completely new at lashes this is the first time I try applying them myself. I love these for the price and will buy more until I master it. Then I will maybe buy more expensive ones? Maybe not cuz I&#x27;m cheap lol.</li>
    <li> I have not received them yet but am very excited to try them!</li>
    <li> Look super fake. But they were $2 so I&#x27;m not that mad</li>
    <li> Waste of money... Could have bought better looking ones at the dollar store.... Do not get these.</li>
    <li> These are terrible, they don&#x27;t look full at all. They look and feel like they&#x27;re made from plastic. I guess they&#x27;d be perfect, if you&#x27;re trying to pretty up a manican.&lt;br /&gt;But what did I expect for the price. At least the got here earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> These lashes have a rubbery texture. It took a month and a half for me to get these lashes. Do NOT buy!</li>
    <li> Bad, bad, bad!  Nothing like the picture.  Do not bother purchasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these lashes before. To those of you giving them bad reviews, yes they are a bit long and rigid. I never wear strip lashes anyways because they always look fake. The trick is to cut these in half and apply a half to each eyelid on the outer corner. It gives you a cute, natural flared look AND you get twice the use out of these :) these are a great bargain if you get creative or you&#x27;re skilled with lashes (I&#x27; ve been using lashes 2+ times a week for the past 5 years)</li>
    <li> These lashes felt like they where made out of cardboard ! I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND this product to anybody !</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girlfriend and she love them.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom &amp; she loved them. They look beautiful &amp; natural</li>
    <li> The worse lashes ever!</li>
    <li> Most lashes came torn off or twisted. Only used one side cause other was damaged.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These lashes are horrible. They&#x27;re plastic! I would definitely not recommend these lashes!</li>
    <li> They weren&#x27;t long at all ..</li>
    <li> I love wearing lashes to complete a make up look. So I was very excited to see these were a cheap price for 10 pairs, when I received the package I was very disappointed. It looked nothing like the pictures I think they&#x27;re made out of plastic. They do not stick well onto the lash line and are very straight they don&#x27;t have a nice shape to them. But you get what you pay for, never again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend these at all! I received them within a week but weren&#x27;t at all what I expected. First off, there plastic, they poke a lot (I didn&#x27;t even have to put them on) they&#x27;re just fake. Not natural looking what so ever. I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like them at all i threw them out.</li>
    <li> These were the worst eyelashes I had. I threw mine out because they were useless</li>
    <li> These are beautiful! Buy them and you&#x27;ll love them!! They DO look like the picture!!</li>
    <li> Horrible. Made from platic</li>
    <li> chip don&#x27;t by not good</li>
    <li> Not what I thought they were</li>
    <li> They look so fake wasnt worth the wait ill never buy eye lashes from here again</li>
    <li> Horrible. I bought these eye lashes and they are not like the picture. They&#x27;re like plastic?</li>
    <li> Look like cheap plastic won&#x27;t purchase these kind again</li>
    <li> Awful!!!! The lashes are plastic</li>
