<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is quite annoying that you have to put it into hot water to get it melted in cold days (actually not so cold, just late summer and early fall in Seattle).</li>
    <li> Love this. Best fragrance ever,too.</li>
    <li> Elemis is used at many really good spas, so I was familiar with the brand but had never tried this product. My skin is very dry and nothing seems to help, so I wanted to try the Frangipani Monoi Body Oil. It really is great because it&#x27;s not oily, and it is even good on your hair as a hot oil treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concentrating on my hands and feet, due to the price, but this oil would really be good all over. The oil absorbs quickly and leaves a lovely, exotic scent behind. This really is almost like a spa experience at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Thisnproduct is a must for anybody with terminally dry skin.  It is expensive but it works, god forbid.  Try it even if for a luxury</li>
    <li> Smells and works amazing</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful! Absorbs easily!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the price!  I have found Elemis at spas for $60.  This is the same thing for a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> Loved it. Arrived a little later than promised but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very hydrating. Smells great. My skin loves it.  Love to use it on my hair as well.</li>
    <li> Live in Arizona and have very dry skin. This oil works really well, keeps my skin moist and smells wonderful!! I was introduced to it on Holland America Cruise Lines.</li>
    <li> Luxury! Warm before use and enjoy the calming scent!</li>
    <li> I have always had very dry skin and this was recommended to me by a cosmotologist on a cruise ship. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.com when my bottle ran out - and at a lower price!</li>
    <li> There just wasn&#x27;t something right about this product. I had previously purchased this body oil from a dermatologist and loved it! However I bought this bottle and the product was less fragrant and smelled different from the last bottle I got even though its the same scent I had purchased before. And when I mixed it with some water (like the dermotologist reccomended I do with this product for ease of application and I had done before with the last bottle) the product turned soapy! This had not happened with the bottle I got from the dermatologist. This kind of made me think it may be diluted in some way for some sketchy reason.</li>
    <li> You have to heat it up to use it. I usually place it in a cup of hot water in my shower, so that it heats up while I shower. Then, once it liquifies, you can use it as a body oil, or on the ends of your hair as a hot oil treatment. I went to an Elemis spa and they used it during a hair and scalp massage. Heavenly! You feel like you are in a spa in an island resort. Great price here. It&#x27;s much more expensive if you buy it in an Elemis spa.</li>
    <li> I always take my own oil when I get a massage. this leaves the skin soft but not greasy. Smell is very soothing</li>
    <li> For the price, I was expecting something a bit more effective than the standard baby or massage oil one can find at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I found this when I was on my 1st cruise in October 2014 and one bottle lasted me over a year.  One drop does one entire foot and the cracking and soreness stays away as long as I am good and use ever time I get out of the shower.  Definitely more reasonable price here than the original one I paid</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product... use in on hands, nails, before shampooing and face for dry spots... absorbs quickly, feels silky smooth..</li>
    <li> Frangipani rocks! I love this stuff for my hair, feet, hands, everywhere. It smells so clean and spa-like. And it makes your skin and hair so soft. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This makes your skin super soft and silky. I bought this initially to use on my rough feet but have found that rich cream works better.  This is great for legs and arms though.</li>
    <li> This oil was used when I had a massage on a Princess cruise.  It has a mild scent, goes in beautifully, and absorbs well.  It stays solid in the bottle and liquifies in hot water.  I do water aerobics three times a week.  Chlorine can be hard on the skin, so following showering, I apply the warmed oil on legs, arms, shoulders, neck/chest.  Massage the nails and hands for the finish.  Your skin will feel silky!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  It lives up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It is light, fragrant and it works.&lt;br /&gt; I love it.</li>
    <li> If you use about 5 to 6 drops in your hair after you shower and let your hair air dry, this will leave your hair feeling soft and healthy without feeling nasty and greasy</li>
    <li> I got a massage on a cruiseship and they suggested that I buy this body oil; however, the price was really high. I found this product online at $20 cheaper. I was told that I would receive it between a week and 2 weeks, but much to my surprise, I got it within a few days. Love how smooth it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Used this while on a cruise ship in Europe and I loved it!  So happy to have been able to order it here. Makes your hair feel wonderful as well as your skin! Would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I first used the frangipani oil at a spa when having my nails done.  I loved the smell.  Liked the smell so much that I ordered it when I got home.</li>
    <li> Love it and will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I am one of those people that cannot stand to feel lotion or oil on my skin.  This absorbs into your skin leaving it soft and moisturized. Very good for feet too!</li>
    <li> The best oil. It feels like satin on your skin</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Reminds me of vacation every time I use it!</li>
    <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve ever found.... I love it!  I use it every day in the shower!</li>
    <li> We put this on our feet at night and cover it with socks.  This oil has made my feet extremely smooth and I use it with the tea tree spray.  Unbelievable results.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Was introduced to it in a spa on a cruise and am now enjoying it at home!  Very softening and light!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful oil - wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
    <li> Great product although you do have to remember to heat in hot water before use. Even so, it is a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This oil is so delicious smelling, I am totally addicted to it. Besides the wonderful fragrance, the oil itself is nice and light, and it absorbs into the skin well, making it soft and hydrated. I ask the therapist to use it when I get a massage - it makes my massage 100% better to engage the senses with something that smells SOOOO good to me!! I also put a few drops in the bath to make it more luxurious. In fact, I have even put it on the dry ends of my hair. Love it, will never stop using it as long as they make it, I always have one on backup for &amp;#34;just in case.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> We originally were presented with Elemis for skin care aboard a cruise ship to the Caribbean and we use it for our skin and hair,  [...] - this site was very informative about Frangipani. The aroma alone of the  Frangipani Flower Scent should make you want to try it.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product several times. This is a high-quality product which does the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34;! As other reviews state, it is solid (consistency of Vaseline) at room temperature, thus you must heat to liquefy. I submerge it into a sink of very warm water for about 5 min, which then turns it back to liquid form (stays this way for a couple hrs or longer). It has a very nice aroma- very soothing, and really feels superb from the warmth--especially compared to other oils, which are usually applied at room temperature. I think the warmth of the oil helps get to those aching muscles more effectively.Since using this product, I have pretty much abandoned all other massage oils. This is a purchase you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It has a lovely light fragrance and helps keep skin and nails from being so dry.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, and is not overpowering. Moisturizes nicely. Does not leave a greasy feeling or sensation if massaged in. Description is accurate. Love it &amp; will buy again!</li>
    <li> It solidified during shipping and needs to be heated every time before I am able to use it.</li>
    <li> Requires that you run hot water on the bottle to melt each time you use it. I prefer the Japanese one because you can just pour and use. However it&#x27;s still a good product to help eliminate dry skin.</li>
    <li> Found this on a cruise ship and have not been without it. I use this on my hair and skin and I must say anything this company makes is fantastic. I know the price may seem high but it is 3 times that on the ships where it is a staple in the spas.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It is a little different than what I bought from spa, but still nice. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and wonderful product!  Absorbs fast and the smell is amazing.  Good size bottle for the money.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This brings me back to our wonderful time on our cruise...</li>
    <li> absolutely the best oil to give yourself that luxury all over feeling.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised. Enjoying.</li>
    <li> An excellent oil which will not disappoint</li>
    <li> My skin loves this oil, it&#x27;s easy to use and a great moisturizer.  And it smells nice, too!</li>
    <li> very efficient and faster delivery than was expected.</li>
    <li> Apply after bathing and be encompassed by this sensual Franigipani Monoi Body Oil and dream the day or night away.[[ASIN:B005AO9SLS Elemis Elemis Sp@home Frangipani Monoi Body Oil - 100 ml]]</li>
    <li> Yet another spa hit. I had a scalp treatment using this oil done at a spa. I loved the smell and had to find it. The spa didn&#x27;t sell it so thank god Amazon had it. I use it every other week on my hair and scalp. You don&#x27;t need a lot just a few drops, then I wrap or braid my hair and go to sleep. Wash it out with shampoo/conditioner  in the morning and your hair is soft! Use the DHC leave in product [[ASIN:B002VS9IES DHC After Bath Hair Treatment Emulsion 5fl.oz./150ml for further treatment/softness.  Especially good if you have dandruff issues. I also use this oil on my skin to keep it soft and supple (first use the body brush[[ASIN:B002OLLSU4 Elemis Body Brush]] to slough off the dead skin. Your new skin will drink this up! Great smelling!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this product while visiting the spa on a Norwegian Cruise.  Of course, the spa price was considerably higher.  Therefore, I am pleased to have found it for an affordable price here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is excellent remedy for dry skin...particularly hands, feet and even hair.  Also has a very pleasing fragrance.</li>
    <li> I used this product throughout my pregnancy and did not get any stretch marks</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells incredible and leaves skin silky smooth but not sticky like lotion.  Leaves skin youthful and hydrated - will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST product ever for winter  dry skin....makes you feel like you are in the tropics!!  Lasts a long time!!</li>
    <li> First encountered this wonderful product on a cruise!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Gets really thick in room temperature. I don&#x27;t have time to warm the bottle up in hot water in the morning when I am getting ready for work. The bottle is smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Got introduced to this product on a cruise to Alaska. Didn&#x27;t know I was hooked after one time.&lt;br /&gt;Your soft and there&#x27;s a lingering smell that is delicious. While on the cruise people ask me&lt;br /&gt;what perfume I use. Its subtle but so so nice.</li>
    <li> Excellent light oil for winter. Good on hands and legs. Quickly absorbed leaving skin soft and moist without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and the oil leaves my skin very soft. A bit of a pain to remember to melt before you can use it, however.</li>
    <li> My found out about this when we were on a cruise a few years ago. She love it. So now I always get it for her. She paid about $55 on the ship and we get it on amazon for about half that. Have never seen it in the stores where we live.</li>
    <li> First tried this on vacation as part of a manicure and bought my first bottle while still on the cruise.  So thrilled to find I can purchase this thru Amazon.  You will smell good and your skin will love it!</li>
    <li> This product has a lower melting point than the moisture melt I got before.  It makes it a little less hassle to use, but with the same fine results.  This oil has made a great improvement to the condition of my hands and nails.  Love the smell.  Expensive but, in my case, definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> The oil is great but you have to put it in hot water for it to become liquid. It takes on a solid form at room temperature.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  Makes my skin feel soft and youthful.  Definitely looking forward to using over the winter to keep my skin smooth and soft.  The body wash and the oil are a great combination.  Love the smell too!</li>
    <li> This oil smells beautiful and feels so luscious.  It is a bit pricey, but for an indulgent treat, it is a winner!</li>
    <li> Was treated to a spa massage while on vacation and this was the oil they used. A little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy, has a clean scent and overall great feel. Will certainly be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this scent many times before from Elemis.  This particular bottle &amp;#34;gelled&amp;#34; probably due to extreme temperature change during shipment.  I run it under hot water and it liquefies for use.  Very nice scent.</li>
    <li> Love Elemis, however this bottle is not in the solid form at room temperature like my previous bottle as described in the description when I ordered it and in the description inside the box.  This bottle has yet to solidify.  It smells the same and seems to have moisturizing effects, but my previous bottle had to be heated and massaged into the skin and made the skin feel smoother...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s great for hands, feet and hair. A bit pricey, but works and lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a cruise at a weak moment because it was so expensive.  Now I won&#x27;t use anything else.  My partner has severe dry skin and he uses it, too and loves it.  He warms it under hot water while he&#x27;s shaving and it liquifies easily.  The scent is subtle but fresh and leaves your skin feeling like silk.  Great for sensitive skin.  A good investment.</li>
    <li> love this body oil, AND can be used on your hair, but just a tad on your hair. It does wonders!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man, and I get dry skin, cracked feet, and this product works miracles. I was first introduced into this item while on a cruise. They tried to sell me some, but I was sure I could get it for half the price on amazon. And I did! Sure, it shipped from England, and had a bit of a wait, but no worries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minute I unpacked the box, I gave myself a home pedicure and this oil was the finishing touch. It feels nice, not greasy, and holds for at least 24 hours. The smell is feminine, but not overly so. I love this product!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, love the way it smells and how it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> My wife feels this oil is the only product to stop her hands from cracking !</li>
    <li> Product good but every time you want to use it -you have to soak in hot water to loosen it up</li>
    <li> This oil is just what the doctor ordered for dry winter skin.  I have used the product before. I love it. Great seller.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle. The first bottle was purchased on NCL ship. Smells nice and really good for damaged hair, dry scalp and dry skin. I also used for mild sun tanning.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product  for $80 on a carnival cruise after a pedicure.  This oil smells wonderful.  Makes my hair and skin silky smooth and feels so nice .  So happy to find it again and start using it on all my rough spots !  I would highly reccomend it !</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this oil on a cruise ship vacation.  The smell of this oil is delicious and absorbs nicely into your skin.  I never feel greasy after use.  Daily use along with \\&quot;skin brushing\\&quot; will make a huge difference in how your skin feels and looks.  You can use it on skin and in hair.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I use the oil on my hair every day and it feels great. Also not losing my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday on my face, neck, chest, arms. I swear some of the wrinkles around my eyes seemed to have relaxed and my complexion glows. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought some on a cruise and paid an arm &amp; a leg but through Amazon, it was much more reasonable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s expensive but still a great value because it works so well and goes a long way. I like to warm it under the hot water tap before applying; it feels so luxurious and has a wonderful, mild aroma that makes me feel so pampered. It&#x27;s wonderful for the skin, and I even use it as a scalp treatment once in a while. Superb product!</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry skin. The body oil absorbs into your skin quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
    <li> Best thing I have every use on my hair.  I love it</li>
    <li> This is the same product line they have on most cruise ships and throughout Europe.  I LOVE Elemis and I got a HUGE deal on Amazon.  It&#x27;s the real deal!  Thanks</li>
    <li> Worth every dime spent for it. I have been using Frangipani Monoi body oil for three years. My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it for hair and body.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the shower gel and the salt glow.  The body oil is amazing.  Use it on your skin, add a few drops to your hair.  I&#x27;m going to try putting it in an oil diffuser.  I cannot get over how authentic the smell is.  I have never found a product that smells exactly like frangipani, until this one.</li>
    <li> Was used by masseuse in a spa and I purchased it. I  fell in love with the product.  Use it after every shower.</li>
    <li> It goes on beautifully, and a little goes a fairly long way.  It&#x27;s not what I&#x27;d call necessary, but it&#x27;s a nice way to pamper yourself for a reasonable price.  I&#x27;ll get it again.</li>
    <li> Affordable and brand new in box. Delivery was in good timing.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Light scent, leaves my skin smooth for hours. Is great as a moisturizer or as a massage oil</li>
    <li> Works like a charm.  The only downside is when you heat it up (necessary) to liquid form, the red flakes come off the bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent for cracked heels along with body butter from Bliss</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It absorbs well (I dare say better than regular lotion) and leaves your skin feeling moisturized but not greasy. Plus, I&#x27;m in love with the smell!&lt;br /&gt;It solidifies at room temperature, but I usually just take it into the shower with me and the heat from the shower is enough to melt it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a really great value. I use it at least 3x a week all over and I&#x27;ve gone through maybe just under half a bottle in a year- a little goes a really, really, really long way.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for people with very dry skin. It moisturizes, provides a protective shield against dryness and smell good.&lt;br /&gt;Although most people in the colder climates would want to use this product then I&#x27;m using it now in the middle of the summer.&lt;br /&gt;I find after a nice bath this is the only thing I need to make my skin feel nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Try this product it is well worth the price. I first was introduced to this product on a cruise ship. The price was almost 50.00.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to purchase this for $34.00. You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Like a lot of other people I discovered this product on a cruise at the spa.  I use it primarily as a hair treatment since I have very dry curly hair.  It really helps to soften and moisturize it.  Also, since I work outdoors , I use it as a body lotion in the winter so my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.  It isn&#x27; greasy and smells great.  I have tried many products over the years and this is the best  I&#x27;ve found.  I highly recommend it .&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
