      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a truly organic and healthy skincare line try something like Eminence or Suki.</li>
      <li>Skinfood&#x27;s sparkling apple line is better at reducing pores and sebum.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Ran out and didn&#x27;t order more,  for about three months</li>

      <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>Skinfood is a good product if you find the right one for your skin</li>
      <li>I love this face wash, It feels very clean and removes everything.</li>

      <li>It leaves my face nice and clean, and I can already feel my face firmer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially a good deal considering how long it lasts.</li>
      <li>:) also got some makeup samples for free.</li>
      <li>the plus side, I&#x27;m pretty sure it removed my eye makeup effectively.</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC  LOVE  </li>
      <li>It smells nice, and after applying and washing it off, it leaves my face feeling super clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>I look forward to using this product more in the summer when oily skin is more frequent and I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a gentle cheap cleanser with a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>ITS  CHEAP  PRICE  </li>
      <li>It does however leave a smooth feeling after you use it.</li>
      <li>Smells light and floraly.</li>
      <li>It has a floral smell (not a fan because I don&#x27;t care for floral scents, but to each her own) that lasts for about 15-30 minutes post wash and whitens very well.</li>
      <li>I  WAS  SATISFIED  AND ITS  MY  FIRST  USE.  </li>
      <li>The smell is really lovely and it foams pretty well.</li>
      <li>I love this foam so much that I just feel obligated to write a review for it!</li>
      <li>This gets my face clean, but it gives it that rubbery-squeaky feeling</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>Skin feels great after using, but it didn&#x27;t dry up any blemishes</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s kinda like that squeaky clean feeling.</li>
      <li>As a 18 year old recovering from severe acne this foam cleanser is pretty good since it leaves me with a ultra clean feel.</li>
      <li>Probably the best face wash I&#x27;ve used as it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin over dry, it leaves it nice and matted (I have oily skin), and my pores cleaned and tight, and skin feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>You will most likely receive more accurate results if you wait.</li>
      <li>TRUE  </li>
      <li>My skin feels super clean after I use it, but not over-dried.</li>
      <li>With that being said, this product will last you a good while.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing foam cleanser that is soft on the face and smells great.</li>
    <li> foams a lot and really soft and good smell! feel like my face is well and carefully treated!  :) also got some makeup samples for free. thanks~</li>
    <li> This is a nice product~! A little goes a long way!! Smells nice too!</li>
    <li> Skin Food products are affordable, smell great, and my skin loves them!</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day: in the shower in the morning, and as the second step in my oil cleanse at night. It&#x27;s made a huge difference in my complexion, even when I was using it on its own for a couple months. I have combination skin that errs on the side of oily, and it&#x27;s been drying without totally drying me out. I had some stubborn acne spots that have really cleared up. Love it, and I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as I can. A little goes a long way, and one tube has lasted me almost four months already (but I do have a second one waiting in the wings).</li>
    <li> I look forward to waking up each day just so I can use this product. After the first time I used it, I know this was different. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to have soft, smooth, bright skin. Now I&#x27;m eager to order the egg white mask after using this miracle cleanser.</li>
    <li> I had samples from Korea of this foam and loved it immediately! It cleans thoroughly without leaving your skin feel dry.</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying, I&#x27;ve never leave reviews for products I by, but this product is an exception. I love this foam so much that I just feel obligated to write a review for it! It is single-handedly the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my skin feel so firm and I really feel like I&#x27;ve gotten a thorough clean every single time I&#x27;ve used this. All you need is a TINY bit in your palm, and it foams up. With that being said, this product will last you a good while. I&#x27;m so happy with my skin right now and I can&#x27;t see myself living without this product!</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC  LOVE  AFTER  FIRST  USE  !  WOW,  I  JUST  GOT  THIS  CLEANSER  FROM  KOREA  POST  AND  THANK  YOU  LORD  JESUS  CHRIST  I  WAS  SATISFIED  AND ITS  MY  FIRST  USE.  PEOPLE  EGGS  AND  ALBUMIN  IS  IN IT,  AND  ITS  ALL  TRUE  WHAT  I  FOUND  ABOUT  THIS  FOAM  CLEANSER  AND  AT  THE  MOMENT  I  WANT  TO  BUY  MORE. ITS  CHEAP  PRICE  AND  ALOT  IS  IN  IT,  AND  WE  CAN  T  GO  WRONG  WITH  THAT  RIGHT  ?  SMILES.  IT  TOOK THEM  A  WHILE  TO  COME  I  WAS  BEGINNING  TO  SEEM  BUT  IN  THE  END  I  GOT  IT  AND  IAM  TOTALLY  GLAD  I  DID.  NO  FRAGRANCE  I  SMELL,  NO  HARD  WAY  TO  REMOVE  IT  EITHER  ,  JUST  A  BEAUTIFUL  CLEANING  EXPERIENCE.  TRY  IT  FOLKS  ,  I  BELIEVE  YOU  TOO  WILL  LIKE  IT,  SMILES.</li>
    <li> This is yet another great product from Skinfood. Even though it&#x27;s creamy it foams and you only need a tiny amount. Smells light and floraly.</li>
    <li> It helps cut back oil and minimize pores. Doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell, but when used twice a day made my skin dry. I only use it once a day in the morning and it&#x27;s enough!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! This facewash was is the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to my face! I have always struggled with mild acne, it was so annoying. With this, my skin looks so smooth, and bright! The bigger pores on my cheeks and my nose have shrunk and are clear of the gross blackheads! My skin feels super clean after I use it, but not over-dried. A word of caution to those with super sensitive skin, mix with a lot of water to dilute. I have somewhat sensitive skin and at first I had some very light irritation when I slathered it on with minimal water (more like a mask consistency). Other than that, this stuff is the bomb! I will definitely be buying more once this runs out (which may be awhile, a little goes a long way!).</li>
    <li> I came across this product while browsing skin care products on Amazon and decided to give this one a try after reading all the good reviews. I&#x27;ve always been interested in trying Korean skin care products due to all the raves about how Koreans take such good care of their skin. Needless to say, this certain brand and product was quite a success. It smells nice, and after applying and washing it off, it leaves my face feeling super clean and smooth. Only con I found is that it leaves my skin a little dry so putting on a good moisturizer after doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Working pretty well so far</li>
    <li> Used but I broke out because I was also using a product with benzoyl peroxide and guessing it conflicted.  If I hadn&#x27;t think it would be a great product.  May still try to use later.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good reviews about SkinFood, so I decided to try some of their products. Since I was in need of a new cleanser, I bought this one. I use this every morning when I wake up before I put make up on and it definitely leaves my face feeling clean and ready.</li>
    <li> I could see the difference before and after using this product. My pores became smaller.i use this cleanser after using oil based cleanser. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on a daily basis for months now, so I have a pretty good idea of how it works for me. It cleanses off makeup really well, for one. I haven&#x27;t had many skin issues while using it, which doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean this improves skin, but at the least I can say for sure that this doesn&#x27;t create problems either. It does have a smell which is that of a basic cleanser - a little soapy, but fairly light. Nothing like eggs (which is a good thing). I don&#x27;t really have issues with large pores, so I can&#x27;t say really whether this helps with that. The egg white mask may be better for pores, since it&#x27;s sitting on the skin for more than a minute. One bonus is that the Egg White Pore Foam, while not very \\&quot;foam-like\\&quot;, really lathers well. You only have to use a tiny amount for the whole face, so a tube lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve concluded it&#x27;s a good cleanser that does the job and I&#x27;d buy it again. It&#x27;s especially a good deal considering how long it lasts. There are no real bad things about it, but it isn&#x27;t anything amazing that will keep me from trying other cleansers, either.</li>
    <li> After using a sample I became hooked on this foam cleanser. It makes my skin feel clean and firm. Doesn&#x27;t dry it out either. I use BB cream everyday and it seems to clean that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy from University101 (seller name)! Although they offer the lowest price, the product was very old. The foam wasn&#x27;t soft, it was literally solid from being so old.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful cleanser for pores.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way with this cleanser. Enjoying it so far.</li>
    <li> I have oily to combination sensitive skin yet still this cleanser dried out my skin in an itchy, ashy way. It made my face looked flushed all day like I had a rash. It also didn&#x27;t help with the size of my pores the 3 times I used it. It made my skin oily for a few days after I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;Skinfood&#x27;s products are a hit and miss. Some things are amazing holy grail products. Others, like this one, I recommend skipping. Skinfood&#x27;s sparkling apple line is better at reducing pores and sebum.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe that Skinfood is an organic brand many of their products have harsh chemicals, like this one. If you&#x27;re looking for a truly organic and healthy skincare line try something like Eminence or Suki.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to put a lot of thought in my daily facial routine and in the past few months I&#x27;ve seen the effect that attitude has taken on my skin.  Breakouts, large pores, uneven texture.  After reading a ton of articles and reviews on Korean skincare and SkinFood products I decided to take the plunge.  I am a changed woman.  This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used.  It gets everything off your skin and out of your pores.  With only three days of use (twice a day) I can already see it working.  My beak outs are healing so quickly, my pores look smaller and my skin is so much more even and smooth.  My makeup glides on now, blends better than ever and leaves me looking airbrushed.  I will never go back to skincare made in the states.  I&#x27;m a total SkinFood convert.</li>
    <li> Love this product ! Thoroughly cleans your skin with just a small amount of product ! I like the fragrance as well and I would definitely buy this again !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third tube after a few years of using this stuff. For my oily/combination/sensitive skin, it&#x27;s a bit harsh in the winter as it focuses mostly on DRYING, not moisturizing. However, it has never really done any harm to my skin, so I mix it up with other gentler and moisturizing cleansers.</li>
    <li> Cannot go wrong with skinfood.</li>
    <li> Great feeling upon first use.  I have sensitive skin &amp; some blackheads/whiteheads in my T zone.  After using a tiny amount (it becomes foam), my face feels very clean and tight.  Afterwards, I examined my pores with a magnifying mirror &amp; it seems that many of the previous clogged pores have cleared up.  It totally surprised me how well it works.</li>
    <li> Great foam cleanser! Skinfood Egg White Pore Foam makes a great 2nd cleanser in the Korean double-cleansing process. It clears out dust, but not leaves your skin too dry. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I noticed a difference within the 2nd day of using it. My skin glowed. The pores seem to shrink a little bit.</li>
    <li> I bought this product before at Glendale mall in LA. It does work on my face. But I left it on the shower room at fitness, so I have to a new one and then I found this cheaper online than at mall. Be honest , it&#x27;s not real stuff compared with the one I used. I don&#x27;t recommend to buy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. AS SOON AS I CAN GET MY COINS IN ORDER (currency conversion is the killer) I AM BUYING THE ENTIRE LINE! You do not have to use a lot of this product so one tube will last months. I like how it brightens the skin. No it&#x27;s not a skin lightener(I am of African descent and not very dark)but it makes you glow. I have oily skin and large pores. I will check back after a month of continuous use to see the \\&quot;pore decreasing effect\\&quot;even though I doubt it will work. I don&#x27;t hold out much hope that ANY product can decrease these mini craters.</li>
    <li> Really cleaned my face. I liked this a lot. Pleasant scent, not too over powering. As always, great product from skin food.</li>
    <li> My best skin care purchase by far on amazon to date. I have experimented with a lot in skin are and I have to say this feels awesome and my skin is super sensitive and did not react at all.</li>
    <li> This gentle cleanser works well.  It foams quickly and gently removes makeup and grime without drying out my skin completely.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice clean feel-only a little bit of it lathers up quite a bit too-great basic cleanser!</li>
    <li> The main reason I gave it a 3 stars is the chemical ingredient list. Contains many harsh chemicals and preservatives that I would like to stay away from. As a cleanser, it cleans okay and makes my face feel strangely rubbery after wash. I ended up finishing the tube quickly as a body wash.</li>
    <li> My gf introduced me to this face wash when she brought me back a bottle from her NYC trip. Probably the best face wash I&#x27;ve used as it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin over dry, it leaves it nice and matted (I have oily skin), and my pores cleaned and tight, and skin feeling smooth. A little goes a long way as a small pea sized drop lathers really well. It&#x27;s been about 9-10 months and I&#x27;m still using the same bottle, but I&#x27;ve already gone and ordered another one.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. My skin feels clean and fresh. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin if I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it has been really hard to find products that suits my face.  As soon as I received this, I tried it and I absolutely love it.  It leaves my face nice and clean, and I can already feel my face firmer.  but most of all, I did not have any irritation to this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was not trackable, but it arrived way sooner than the expected date.  I am truly happy with this product and also with the seller!  its A + + + for me.</li>
    <li> I just got this product in the mail. I&#x27;ve only been able to try it once, but even with just one use I can see and feel a dramatic difference. It left my face matte and super smooth. It does leave my face kind of tight feeling, but I think that would be the egg white part of the wash working. I did put moisturizer on afterward and my skin&#x27;s still a little tight, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the fact my face needs to get used to it. The smell is really lovely and it foams pretty well. With just one use I can also tell my pores are super cleaned and smaller. I really like this product so far and can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* It has now been a couple of months since I&#x27;ve started using this in my daily skincare routine. I have to say I haven&#x27;t had a major breakout since. I only use it in my morning routine. I do on occasion get a clogged pore where I always get them (personally on me it&#x27;s around my nose), but they&#x27;re very minor and are gone with just a hot washcloth. Before using this I probably got a huge planet sized blemish at least once a week. After this I haven&#x27;t had one SINCE! I now keep receiving complements on my skin and how it&#x27;s either cleared up or just looks really good and healthy. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and in love with it. I only use a tiny bit, probably the size of a dime, not even maybe. I follow the back instructions as well on the back that suggest rinsing with cold water. I think that helps, but it maybe just me. Either way, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s like me fighting acne and bad blemishes. It&#x27;s really really helped my skin and I can&#x27;t get enough of it! I&#x27;m never going back to drugstore cleaners ever again! Only skinfood for my face from now on!</li>
    <li> I have used Skin Food green tea cleanser for some time and decided to try out this egg white one based on the good review. Unfortunately this new cleanser doesn&#x27;t work for me and i had a lot of breakouts since using it. Definitely not buying again.</li>
    <li> This face wash is amazing it feels like you are washing your face with liquid silk and your skin feels and looks great afterwards - can&#x27;t recommend this enough!</li>
    <li> Dint do any thing spl for me . like other face wash  does not smell any thing .</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I don&#x27;t use it nearly as much as I should but when I do, OMG!</li>
    <li> My friend got me this as a gift, and it works really well. It takes off makeup really well too :&#x27;D</li>
    <li> I use this foam cleanser in the evening after a long day out. It&#x27;s gentle and it cleans your dirties very well.</li>
    <li> the product is nice and mild, but hard to squeeze out.</li>
    <li> When I wash my face with it, my skin is soooo refreshed and clean !!&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need too much product. I remove everything with it, and I don&#x27;t have any problems (no dry, no acne, doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes).&lt;br /&gt;My pores looks smaller, my skin looks brighter.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. A little bit goes a long way! Makes my skin feel squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t go a day without using this face wash, idk what it is about it but it helps me out a lot. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years now. There was a moment when I didn&#x27;t have it... Ran out and didn&#x27;t order more,  for about three months and I bring out really bad, took me a while to clear my face. Ever since then I order in quantities, since it&#x27;s shipped from over seas expect a small delay so always have a back up bottle. I also use a scrub add my daily routine, I scrub then wash with this foam. I&#x27;m a lifetime customer.</li>
    <li> Great face wash..makes skin tighter and closes pores and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is the best face wash I have ever used. There is a noticeable difference in the brightness of my skin and it gets rid of excess oil like a pro. It may feel a bit drying to some, but that&#x27;s why you should moisturize after washing your face no matter what cleanser you are using.</li>
    <li> ALMOST. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as tight as an egg white mask, but it does make my face feel squeaky clean. It seems to help keep my face from looking oily for a longer period of time than other cleansers. It&#x27;s a keeper in my skincare product rotation for sure.</li>
    <li> Skinfood is a good product if you find the right one for your skin however this product did not make my skin worse but it didn&#x27;t make it better either. It does however leave a smooth feeling after you use it. I still use it once in a while at night. I break out if I use it everyday so it is an okay product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package was good and it came with samples so I was happy with that. It came on time too.</li>
    <li> its an excellent cleanser, leaves the skin smooth and soft and ready to receive the next steps of your skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve sampled this product before and that&#x27;s why I liked it, it leaves your skin feeling really clean without that overly dried out feature most cleansers leave.</li>
    <li> This stuff foams up a lot. Maybe that&#x27;s your thing? This gets my face clean, but it gives it that rubbery-squeaky feeling that I know associate with dryness. It almost feels like it&#x27;s leaving a film of egg rubber, or whatever it is, on my face. It&#x27;s like someone&#x27;s put a micro-thin coating of saran wrap on my face. I think it strips oil from your face, and I&#x27;m trying to avoid this since I have dryish skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I&#x27;m pretty sure it removed my eye makeup effectively. Also on the plus side - this makes a great soap for leg-shaving. Just be sure you lotion up afterward.</li>
    <li> I think it is not only relevant, but necessary to describe your skin type in skincare product reviews, so; I have ultra sensitive, dry, acne prone skin. I also have large pores and I&#x27;m quite pale for a Caucasian.&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this product, my skin was not acne prone (the acne is NOT do to this product) and it greatly reduced the size and visibility of pores. After each wash, my skin felt extra dry and quite tight, but I would temporarily solve that with a moisturizer. After about a week of daily use, I noticed that a rash had developed on my cheeks and my skin looked strained and dry. I felt like a sunburnt snake and this product was the only change I had made, so sadly, I gave it up. Side note-it also made my skin lighter. If I get any whiter than I naturally am, I will bare a staggering resemblance to Caspar.&lt;br /&gt;The product, in general, is great. It has a floral smell (not a fan because I don&#x27;t care for floral scents, but to each her own) that lasts for about 15-30 minutes post wash and whitens very well. It shrinks pores, but didn&#x27;t really do anything to the few pimples I did have at the time.&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT ALL SKINCARE PRODUCTS:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t advise starting a new product when you are about to start or are on your period. You will most likely receive more accurate results if you wait.</li>
    <li> As a 18 year old recovering from severe acne this foam cleanser is pretty good since it leaves me with a ultra clean feel. Although since I&#x27;ve been using it through the winter it&#x27;s seriously dried my skin to the point where it flakes after a wash. I have noticed my skin clearing up but I dont give all the credit to this product since I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with Cetaphil, Simple Micellar Water Cleanser, sample essence bottles from Etude House, etc. I look forward to using this product more in the summer when oily skin is more frequent and I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a gentle cheap cleanser with a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I broke out like crazy after using this. It didn&#x27;t remove my makeup completely and made my face really dry. Still oily :( I really wanted to like this.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and this brand. It cleans my face better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before. My face isn&#x27;t oily or dry just nice smooth and clean. I also love that it&#x27;s affordable and a little goes a long way. My teenage girls use it and love it too. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it as step two in my korean Inspired cleanse . Love the smell too.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and prone to blackheads/whiteheads. I have numerous cleanser; but none has been as effective in clearing my pores as this product. I am still currently using this product. I don&#x27;t even notice my blackheads anymore and my pores has shrunk since.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash, It feels very clean and removes everything. Does not irritate my skin, in fact my skin has never felt better.</li>
    <li> this product cannot bring me the ideal effect for my skin,when i used it, my skin looks very dry.i feel uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;then, i just use it a week,so i am not sure it is have shrinkage of enlarged pores function.</li>
    <li> Skin feels great after using, but it didn&#x27;t dry up any blemishes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It does its job in cleaning my face without drying my skin but it does irritate me that the lid for the tube didn&#x27;t screw on properly. I had to use my old Face shop Acerola cleanser lid to replace it... I don&#x27;t know if it was just mine but definitely not user friendly with a defective lid.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product and have been using it as a replacement for my old drugstore cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a good product - not incredible - but it does its job. It has a very thick consistency - which is odd for a foam - and emits no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I think it is a fine cleanser, you could definitely find equally-functioning products at your local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the upside is that most of the product comes from egg whites extract and other natural nutrients - which is appealing to those that are looking for an organically-based product!</li>
    <li> I would post love it if it wasn&#x27;t for the weird feeling it gives you when it gets in your eyes, which I mean, it&#x27;s soap in your eyes, what do you expect?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a very gentle foam that I&#x27;ve been using with my clarisonic. It&#x27;s a very soft cleanser that allows my brushes to glide over my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any more tears in my face.  I have moderate cystic acne and it&#x27;s gentle enough to cleanse with multiple times a day and hasn&#x27;t broken me out or dried me out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s replaced my expensive Boschia cleansers, so I&#x27;m happy as a clam.</li>
    <li> Very foamy and fun! After cleansing it feels a little rubbery but it&#x27;s kinda like that squeaky clean feeling. I moisturize right at that point and it feels great. It certainly does get into your pores and clean it out, be sure to use the toner afterwards, if not then it&#x27;s okay but it does help if you&#x27;re going to be using the serum.</li>
