      <li>I love this Seaweed Bath Salt.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I love taking a bath with these crystals.</li>

      <li>I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t necessarily feel anything especially fantastic is going on when I sit in the tub with this</li>
      <li>I did try some lavendar epsom salts after this bath exprience that I bought from the pharmacy in a huge bag and they were cheaper and more relaxing</li>
      <li>but it was very refreshing feeling, very detoxifying</li>
      <li>heaven second time ordering no surprises smooth transaction wonderful product prompt service exactly as ordered plus the fact that i adore this product leaves my body happy and relaxed wish it came in a larger size.</li>
      <li>and it was a great overall experience.  </li>
      <li>Light smell but nothing overpowering.</li>
      <li>about 1/2 way through my tub being filled</li>
      <li>This works great other than having to clean the tub more.</li>
      <li>like I normally do knowing that those pieces would just gunk up my nice tub.  </li>
      <li>I was actually watching the jets carfully to make sure none got in there which takes away from the nice relaxing bath experience.  </li>
      <li>I like the idea of detoxing and of using something more natural than most of the chemical bubble baths out there.  </li>
      <li>It could be because when I take a bath I know I have a clean house</li>
      <li>but when I soaked in them it didn&#x27;t feel like anything special at all.  </li>
      <li>All I really know is that I love it.</li>
      <li>Experimented with an abundant of natural bath salt configurations.</li>
      <li>The smell was not bad either, as I had feared.  </li>
      <li>In fact, I live life with a healthy dose of skepticism.</li>
      <li>I love how the seaweed turns the bathtub a nice shade of green.</li>
      <li>I really did enjoy soaking in this bath...</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling so soft and healthy.  </li>
      <li>The mixture is just right</li>
      <li>This is very reasonably priced and has lasted me for quite some time.</li>
      <li>I am hoping this will help any potential buyer out there looking for some more information.  </li>
      <li>I have used the product 2x, the first time I put in the seaweed bath salt</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>so I probably will use them again but just not very often, and not in my nice tub.</li>
      <li>This product dissolves in a hot bath water.  </li>
      <li>I am aware that seaweed is a known detoxifyer, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to start my relaxing experiences.</li>
      <li>I really like this bath salt.</li>
      <li>I wanted to really like these bathsalts</li>
      <li>but this salt really helped relax me.</li>
      <li>Very relaxing.</li>
      <li>soaks are very beneficial and healthful...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know how it works, or why it does.</li>
      <li>They to moisturize really well</li>
      <li>Again, I don&#x27;t really know that you get any miracle feelings or sensations.</li>
      <li>I noticed that my skin was softer and it was very relaxing.  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t make it very aesthetically pleasing.  </li>
      <li>So I ignored them and relaxed away but don&#x27;t think there was anything any more relaxing about the seaweed than any other additive.    </li>
      <li>They are nice but do have to say they leave a little residue in the bath tub - but other than that we enjoy adding it to the bath and mixing with bubbles.</li>
      <li>I would say any great affect after is merely from taking a warm relaxing bath and not much more.    </li>
      <li>I have not had any issues with it draining from the tub cleanly and the bag has lasted me a long time.</li>
      <li>They used dried powdered seaweed and spirulina that easily melts into the water - giving it a nice green tint and oceany (is that a word) smell.  </li>
      <li>It is expensive but nice for special treat.</li>
      <li>Yeah, I normally feel kinda square, but these salts are from another world.</li>
      <li>I took a bath mid-day when I normally take a shower.  </li>
      <li>The seaweed salt is relaxing and makes my skin feel more firm.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t normally feel like that.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t get to run the bath like I normally do</li>
      <li>I followed the Seaweed Bath Salt&#x27;s directions and put them into a muslin bag before dropping them into the bath, as I thought green seaweed would be stuck in my hair, but it really wasn&#x27;t necessary as it all dissolved nicely into a relaxing green-hued bathing experience.</li>
      <li>This is also much easier to clean from the tub than other seaweed baths I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It actually feels like a whole lot of nada, but after the 20 minutes are up, I feel like I&#x27;ve just had lengthy massage at a high end spa.</li>
      <li>Like it and didn&#x27;t leave a huge mess in tub.</li>
      <li>however I personally add a little Epsom salt for better results since I use it as a part of my weight loss regimen.</li>
      <li>These actually work really well.  </li>
      <li>I had hoped that I would somehow feel different after using the product, but didn&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
      <li>The only problem I had with this is that it does not dissolve very well.  </li>
      <li>and my skin didn&#x27;t feel particularily soft afterwards.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably too expensive for every day use for people on a budget, but if you like a good bath</li>
      <li>The only minor negative thing is that they smell like seaweed...not too pleasant.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I hoped I would like this product since it was a bit of an indulgence, and typically seaweed&lt;br /&gt;bath soaks are very beneficial and healthful...I experienced none of the benefits with this&lt;br /&gt;product. I should have trusted my instincts when ordering.</li>
    <li> I really did enjoy soaking in this bath... I noticed that my skin was softer and it was very relaxing.  I like the idea of detoxing and of using something more natural than most of the chemical bubble baths out there.  The smell was not bad either, as I had feared.  When I opened the package I was afraid my bathroom was going to smell like seaweed all night, but that was not the case.  The only problem I had with this is that it does not dissolve very well.  There are little chunks of seaweed that float around and don&#x27;t make it very aesthetically pleasing.  I chose to ignore that, but also noticed that it was less relaxing as I had hoped because I needed to wash the tub out immediately after bathing in order to rinse away the little pieces of seaweed and get rid of the green water line that formed around the tub each time.  Other than being a little messy, it is very enjoyable and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is like  spa treatment at home.  Don&#x27;t forget to wrap up and relax in a warm towel and/or robe after the soak.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Its sooooooooooooo relaxing!  I actually dozed off in the tub once while soaking in it (don&#x27;t worry I had a neck pillow lol).</li>
    <li> I have tried this product an it is great! I&#x27;m using it to help detox from some meds. I was prescribed, that I had a bad reaction to.</li>
    <li> I wanted to really like these bathsalts but when I soaked in them it didn&#x27;t feel like anything special at all.  The salts were unscented (except for a very light seaweed scent) so it didn&#x27;t have that spa feeling and my skin didn&#x27;t feel particularily soft afterwards.  The seaweek also leaves a mess in the bathtub since they don&#x27;t dissolve (used it 3x&#x27;s so far) so you definitely need to rinse your tub after soaking.  I&#x27;ll use the rest of the bag but doubt i&#x27;ll get another.</li>
    <li> It feels real good and helped when I was recovering from a lower back injury. It&#x27;s probably too expensive for every day use for people on a budget, but if you like a good bath it&#x27;s nice to have around. Very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I am aware that seaweed is a known detoxifyer, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to start my relaxing experiences. I have added some foaming bath cream to it as a boost of luxury too. It turns water a bit green wich I like as it adds to relaxing spa type of treatment. It was just what a doctor ordered. I always feel renewed after my baths.</li>
    <li> I really like this bath salt. I usually mix it with various salts, oils and essential oils to make my own bath salts. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. My one complaint is you have to rinse well after using, or risk having tiny flakes of seaweed stuck to you.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It turns the bath water a seaweed green color,  but works well.  It&#x27;s good to take a bath with these salts before going to sleep, or a nap...the theraputic benefits are deeply relaxing.</li>
    <li> I used it with a seaweed mask that was fishy smelling so I&#x27;m not sure if the bath contributed to that fishy smell yet or not, will probably continue to use both at the same time but it was very refreshing feeling, very detoxifying so I can get past the smell...just best done in private. With the combination of the seaweed bath and mask, it provided the same relaxation and comfort of a spa seaweed wrap, only much cheaper and private. Good idea to rest afterward as it feels like it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; so to speak after the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am a regular bath taker. I love baths, and I love salts. Experimented with an abundant of natural bath salt configurations. But this is one of my favorite. Yes, it leaves a residue of seaweed on the tub. But after I take a bath in this I feel like a friggin&#x27; mermaid or magical sea creature- and I don&#x27;t normally feel like that. Yeah, I normally feel kinda square, but these salts are from another world. Buy them for your loved ones and for you. Amazing!</li>
    <li> Aahh! Relaxation and a skin detox cleansing at the same time. I bought these after a recommendation for following a body detox-cleanse. I followed the Seaweed Bath Salt&#x27;s directions and put them into a muslin bag before dropping them into the bath, as I thought green seaweed would be stuck in my hair, but it really wasn&#x27;t necessary as it all dissolved nicely into a relaxing green-hued bathing experience. My skin felt slightly tingly throughout the bath. I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> I love how the seaweed turns the bathtub a nice shade of green. It sort of feels like I have been transferred to a spa. The seaweed salt is relaxing and makes my skin feel more firm. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the price/quantity ratio. It is expensive but nice for special treat.</li>
    <li> Like it and didn&#x27;t leave a huge mess in tub.</li>
    <li> Great product! The mixture is just right however I personally add a little Epsom salt for better results since I use it as a part of my weight loss regimen.</li>
    <li> I am hoping this will help any potential buyer out there looking for some more information.  I&#x27;m not really sure that the intended effect really works here.  I had hoped that I would somehow feel different after using the product, but didn&#x27;t really do much.  I would say any great affect after is merely from taking a warm relaxing bath and not much more.    What I was displeased the most with is the dissolving issue.  The product is very coarse in the bag, almost like rock salt.  I have used the product 2x, the first time I put in the seaweed bath salt about 1/2 way through my tub being filled and it didn&#x27;t really disolve very good at all.  The next time I put them in before I even turned on the tub and they dissolved much better, but still not great.  I have a whirlpool bath and the particles were big enough that didn&#x27;t dissolve that I worried it could get stuck in the jets so I didn&#x27;t get to run the bath like I normally do which is dissapointing to be honest.  Plus it got my nice tub a dirty with the seaweed particles that didn&#x27;t dissolve.    I will tell you that about 1/2 of the ones that didnt&#x27; dissolve from the tub I could get to break up &amp; dissolve with a bit of pressure from my hands.  The other half just were never going to dissolve.  So again I didn&#x27;t want to run my tub like I normally do knowing that those pieces would just gunk up my nice tub.  I was actually watching the jets carfully to make sure none got in there which takes away from the nice relaxing bath experience.  So I ignored them and relaxed away but don&#x27;t think there was anything any more relaxing about the seaweed than any other additive.    I did try some lavendar epsom salts after this bath exprience that I bought from the pharmacy in a huge bag and they were cheaper and more relaxing so I probably won&#x27;t use the seaweed one again.  I hate to just throw money down the drain so I probably will use them again but just not very often, and not in my nice tub.</li>
    <li> I love this Seaweed Bath Salt.  What relaxation it provides!  The relaxed, rejuvanating feeling continues for about 30 minutes after a 30 minute bath.  This is a great product! This is also much easier to clean from the tub than other seaweed baths I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My skin soaked up this product like a sponge. If feels great, I use it every day You can see it working.</li>
    <li> I love taking a bath with these crystals. They are a greenish blue colour - as seaweed is. I feel so relaxed and feel awesome after bathing in these salts.</li>
    <li> This bath salt smells terrible. I opened the package and felt like throwing up. It immediately went into the garbage. There was nothing relaxing about this product.</li>
    <li> It could be because when I take a bath I know I have a clean house andi go all out with candles, music, etc...but this salt really helped relax me. And frankly had an almost climatic component to my baths. I have not had any issues with it draining from the tub cleanly and the bag has lasted me a long time. I do follow directions and relax in my cozy bed right after the bath.</li>
    <li> I simply like it and don&#x27;t find any drawbacks in this product. It dissolves easy, has a good after-feel, and I hope works well too.</li>
    <li> I discovered seaweed baths on a cruise. I shopped around and found the products to be quite expensive. This is very reasonably priced and has lasted me for quite some time. I use this in conjunction with a milk bath and believe them to have had a health benefit for me. No, I&#x27;m not particularly subjected to placebo effects. In fact, I live life with a healthy dose of skepticism.</li>
    <li> These actually work really well.  I took a bath mid-day when I normally take a shower.  I had some things to do afterwords and I shouldn&#x27;t have planned them.  I was so relaxed after using these.  They to moisturize really well and it was a great overall experience.  The only minor negative thing is that they smell like seaweed...not too pleasant.  However, as soon as they went into the bath, I couldn&#x27;t smell them anymore.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin green like I imagined it would. It doesn&#x27;t leave a ring around my tub, it doesn&#x27;t smell awful either. It actually looks like little crumbled sea salts that are colored various shades of green. I don&#x27;t know what exactly I was expecting it to look like, but I was happy it didn&#x27;t look like seaweed in my tub, lol. It&#x27;s not a very big bag, &amp; you only need 1/2 a cup for one bath, so I&#x27;m guessing one bag will be about 15 or so baths maybe? Not sure just yet, I&#x27;m just trying to give you guys an idea of the size of the bag &amp; the amounts of baths you&#x27;ll get out of it. I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t necessarily feel anything especially fantastic is going on when I sit in the tub with this, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin tingle, or anything like that. I guess you&#x27;ll get a warm fuzzy feeling inside of your head because you know you&#x27;re doing something good for yourself. So I soak in the tub for a while, wait my 20 minutes, then hop out, pat dry as the directions say, wrap myself in my fuzziest long robe, lay down in bed, &amp; wait another 20 minutes. Again, I don&#x27;t really know that you get any miracle feelings or sensations. It actually feels like a whole lot of nada, but after the 20 minutes are up, I feel like I&#x27;ve just had lengthy massage at a high end spa. And I don&#x27;t feel like jumping up &amp; tackling my to-do list, I just feel very relaxed, &amp; just sort of wonderful. I don&#x27;t really know how it works, or why it does. I know seaweed is great for your skin, &amp; for detoxing. All I really know is that I love it. And I think if you try it, you&#x27;ll probably love it too. I&#x27;m happy I tried this, I will definitely re-buy once I start running low.</li>
    <li> This product dissolves in a hot bath water.  I use it once of week.  It soothes tired muscles, and helps when retaining fluids.</li>
    <li> This works great other than having to clean the tub more. Light smell but nothing overpowering. Great for in the tub or in foot soak. I also mixed it with Lavender Epsom salt for tight muscles.</li>
    <li> I used to get algue (sea algea) bath salts from France, but they are hard to find now.  This seaweed bath salt is the next best thing.  They used dried powdered seaweed and spirulina that easily melts into the water - giving it a nice green tint and oceany (is that a word) smell.  Crank up the hot water, soak your tired bones and drift away.  I have arthritis and this is one of my favorite soaks.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend just loves these</li>
    <li> After using the product it made me feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> They are nice but do have to say they leave a little residue in the bath tub - but other than that we enjoy adding it to the bath and mixing with bubbles.</li>
    <li> This seaweed bath salt is awesome.  It leaves my skin feeling so soft and healthy.  The seaweed is very small, and creates green-tinted bath water.  Just a heads-up, it smells like the ocean.  :)</li>
    <li> This seaweed bath salt is surprisingly moisturizing.  It is a little messy as it does not all completely dissolve in the bath water, but, again, the relaxation and moisture effects are worth the extra cleanup required.</li>
    <li> heaven second time ordering no surprises smooth transaction wonderful product prompt service exactly as ordered plus the fact that i adore this product leaves my body happy and relaxed wish it came in a larger size.</li>
