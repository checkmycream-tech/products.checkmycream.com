      <li>So happy I found this!</li>
      <li>But for me it&#x27;s the best BB type product I&#x27;ve ever tried ( and I&#x27;ve tried maybe 20+).  </li>
      <li>This makes your skin glow and looks flawless.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see this working for darker skinned or very fair redhead freckled types, just based on the color and how it blends out.</li>
      <li>it is great ...ordered it again</li>
      <li>it should be great.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s great as a foundation replacement</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>It costs more than I would like to pay, but is so good that I rationalized spreading the cost out over the 6+ months it will last me.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I live in south FL and sun</li>
      <li>Also it creates a great base for products like MAC studiofix or other airbrush type powders, to really grip , be more vivid, and increase staying power.  </li>
      <li>Blurs fine lines, uneven texture.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and adds a little glow you my skin.  </li>
      <li>and this provides enough light coverage for me but is a good makeup base if I need it.</li>
      <li>Spotlight is just that, for a bare coverage.  </li>
      <li>This feels so nice on your skin and gives you some color without being fake or cake.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m blonde/blue with light but not extremely fair skin.</li>

    <li> I like the silky feeling of this skin transformer, but the coverage is very bare unlike the original skin transformer face.  Spotlight is just that, for a bare coverage.  Probably good for the summer and beach time when your skin might be a wee bit red.</li>
    <li> Miracle Skin gives your skin a healthy, natural glow. You don&#x27;t need makeup when you wear Miracle Skin!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It goes on smooth and adds a little glow you my skin.  It also helps to cover up those small flaws.  I wish it were a little less expensive, but I do think it&#x27;s going to last a while.</li>
    <li> Gives my skin a nice summery shimmery bronze. Love it! On my second bottle</li>
    <li> Love this product!! You can use this for all over bronzing or for highlighting or contouring. I have very fair skin, so a little goes a long way and helps to enhance my best features.</li>
    <li> Best product of its type I have tried so far. I retired so don&#x27;t wear makeup on a daily basis anymore and this provides enough light coverage for me but is a good makeup base if I need it.</li>
    <li> Guess it&#x27;s okay... Didn&#x27;t notice anything spectacular.. But also didn&#x27;t have any negative result from using it</li>
    <li> I have LOVED this. I&#x27;ve totally ditched my foundation and only use this with a little benefit boi-ing concealer and loose powder.

    <li> Horrible. I love and use Miracle Skin Transformer every day. But this &amp;#34;Spotlight&amp;#34; product has a Really weird consistency and the color! It&#x27;s like a fake tan, only also cheap shiny metallic. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
    <li> it is great ...ordered it again</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Gives such a nice glow!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  I am simply amazed at how much better my skin looks since starting to use this. I have only been using it a couple of weeks and have already gotten several compliments about my complexion. I have even cut way back on makeup use.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I live in south FL and sun is my enemy and regular make up is something I avoid.  This feels so nice on your skin and gives you some color without being fake or cake.  I&#x27;ve not found anything I like better.</li>
    <li> What happened to my Miracle? I used to by this product for many yrs when it was sold at Sephora until they stopped carrying it. I loved this product but it does not seem like the same stuff when  ordering from Amazon.  It does not have the same coverage as before!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see this working for darker skinned or very fair redhead freckled types, just based on the color and how it blends out. Anyone light- lighter medium/olive it should be great.  I&#x27;m blonde/blue with light but not extremely fair skin. But for me it&#x27;s the best BB type product I&#x27;ve ever tried ( and I&#x27;ve tried maybe 20+).  Really warms up your skin tone. Also it creates a great base for products like MAC studiofix or other airbrush type powders, to really grip , be more vivid, and increase staying power.  Blurs fine lines, uneven texture.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best BB cream going. First got it on sale @closeout on Soft Surrounding website. It costs more than I would like to pay, but is so good that I rationalized spreading the cost out over the 6+ months it will last me.</li>
    <li> I received this product in one of my monthly samples boxes. I can&#x27;t remember if it was Birchbox or Ipsy. but i loved it so much that i found it on Amazon cheaper and had to have it. it&#x27;s great as a foundation replacement but i like to use my moisturizer before i put it on.</li>
    <li> Love this, makes my skin look and feel wonderful  So happy I found this!</li>
    <li> This makes your skin glow and looks flawless. My new go to for summer fresh skin. A little goes a long way so for the price it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
