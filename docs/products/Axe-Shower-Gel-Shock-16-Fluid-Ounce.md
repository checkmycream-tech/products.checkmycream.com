      <li>I can&#x27;t find in most stores.  </li>
      <li>Was glad  to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, they keep an eye out for what they have in stock more often..</li>
      <li>I wish our stores stopped carrying it, maybe too many scents to choose from now with Axe.</li>

      <li>So glad I found it here.  </li>
      <li>Great for those hot summer days when you take a shower and your body feels cool despite hot and humid weather</li>
      <li>The product is great, but it is advertised as a 6 Pack and only one bottle showed up in the box.</li>
      <li>I really like this after a good workout or right before bed.</li>
      <li>It has that after cool affect.  </li>
      <li>it scrubs great and doesn&#x27;t wash away as soon as you put some in your hand, so you can use less and actually get a good wash.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad this is a subscribe-able product because all of my local stores stopped carrying this.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and wanted.</li>
      <li>If you use it as much as I do just subscribe and put it in the &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; pile.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s sad because this is a great product...</li>
      <li>Hah, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a bad thing, but it is definitely tingly, however after any shower it does leave you with a nice&amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feel, not cool like you&#x27;re ready to take on the world, but on a hot summer day it is nice to feel like a chill.</li>

    <li> Best gel on the market for my money.  I can&#x27;t find in most stores.  Don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s a great product!!.&lt;br /&gt;  Ron</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, they keep an eye out for what they have in stock more often..</li>
    <li> Great stuff, hope they don&#x27;t discontinue.</li>
    <li> I really like this after a good workout or right before bed. That tingle and refreashness that it gives you is wonderful. The spray does not smell the same so I won&#x27;t purchase it again. The gel. I will keep on buying!</li>
    <li> very nice item, my boyfriend was very happy</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find it anywhere except online! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;x axe shower gel and it&#x27;s exactly what I ordered and wanted. Now chicks cant keep their hands off of me, the label on the back is actually correct!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this scent, we can only order it here so, I don&#x27;t mind the six pack. My son&#x27;s like this as well. It has went up now it&#x27;s 70.00 dollars. That&#x27;s sad because this is a great product...guess I will take a star due to the price increase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very glad this is a subscribe-able product because all of my local stores stopped carrying this.  If you use it as much as I do just subscribe and put it in the &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; pile.</li>
    <li> Smells great. A tingly refreshing eye opening masculant shower gel!</li>
    <li> My local shops stop carrying this product. Was glad  to find it on Amazon.  It has that after cool affect.  Great for those hot summer days when you take a shower and your body feels cool despite hot and humid weather</li>
    <li> I have never rated any body wash/face wash/shampoo in my life.  I wanted to do a review, because this shower gel definitely leaves you feeling tingly.........especially if you are manscaping.  Hah, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a bad thing, but it is definitely tingly, however after any shower it does leave you with a nice&amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; feel, not cool like you&#x27;re ready to take on the world, but on a hot summer day it is nice to feel like a chill.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  My husband&#x27;s favorite scent.  He was traditionally a bar soap guy (yuck!) and we tried several body washes until we found this one and he LOVES it!</li>
    <li> So glad I found it here.  None of our local stores carry this scent anymore and it&#x27;s my husbands favorite.  I don&#x27;t mind buying it in bulk.  I wish our stores stopped carrying it, maybe too many scents to choose from now with Axe.</li>
    <li> The product is great, but it is advertised as a 6 Pack and only one bottle showed up in the box.</li>
    <li> This is the best Axe shower gel- it scrubs great and doesn&#x27;t wash away as soon as you put some in your hand, so you can use less and actually get a good wash. Smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...so does my lady friend.</li>
    <li> Best shower jelly they ever made</li>
