      <li>I did receive this a reduced cost for an honest opinion &amp; I&#x27;m so glad!</li>
      <li>/&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?</li>
      <li>Given the sunburn protection, it&#x27;s a great addition to my skin care regimen - because I love getting that sun-activated vitamin D. That it fights antioxidants and free radicals is a bonus, but in terms of what I&#x27;ve seen in my short-term use is brighter skin!</li>

      <li>The best serum so far!</li>
      <li>I LOVE it and am so glad I found it!</li>
      <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
      <li>The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only is this one of the most effective vitamin C serums out there, it&#x27;s also the best smelling one I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Since I started using this my skin has become very smooth.  </li>
      <li>yes I am over 50), this one is at the top of my list.</li>

      <li>Especially nice as a moisturizer following Retinol treatment.  </li>
      <li>I ran across this, and decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
      <li>I love this serum.</li>
      <li>The serums are my favorite.  </li>
      <li>The Vit C is Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate since it is a more stable form of Vit C than L-Ascorbic Acid.</li>
      <li>My skin feels softer and appears more resilient.</li>
      <li>If I could add more stars to rate them, I would.</li>
      <li>I Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all of the Tree of Life products and I absolutely love them, with the exception of this.</li>
      <li>hope to see more products from this brand</li>
      <li>Significantly!</li>
      <li>I have very mild redness on my face.</li>
      <li>Skin is visibly smoother and there is a noticeable reduction in depth of fine wrinkles.</li>
      <li>shipping and all previous products have been excellent!</li>
      <li>I love the way it absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin really smooth.  </li>
      <li>a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d like to say that the serum was great, however, I dropped it and it spilled after only one use!</li>
      <li>Smooth,</li>
      <li>Goes on nicely, spreads nice and id say a lot goes a long way!</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m excited to try the Scar Cream on my acne scars on my face</li>
      <li>I really enjoyed using this product it made my skin look more alive and softer and brighter.</li>
      <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.any incentive or reward for a positive review.</li>
      <li>This vitamin C serum smooth and calm my face.</li>
      <li>My aunt absolutely loves this product and will buy more when she runs out..</li>
      <li>Observe into skin quickly And makes skin supple!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>and that gets super oily.  </li>
      <li>It smells like freshly peeled citrus.</li>
      <li>Oh, I may&#x27;ve received this at a discounted rate for an honest review, but I&#x27;m definitely hooked as a customer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for over 10 days now, as I always evaluate all skin care products for about 7-10 days before sharing my opinion, and honestly, I have no plans of switching to anything else.</li>
      <li>It makes skin soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>received a complimentary sample of the product for evaluation purposes.</li>
      <li>the past year, I have tried probably about 20 Vitamin C serums and while some of them were pretty decent, none were as effective and as absolutely gorgeously smelling as the Alina one.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t order this particular one, but have ordered other things from this company and it has been great.  </li>
      <li>I just ordered more, and am planning on trying a few more of their products.</li>
      <li>This serum smells exactly like that.</li>
      <li>My skin looked brighter within the first couple days.</li>
      <li>This exact formula seems to be marketed under a number of brand names including this one, Elleda, and Majestic Pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really do love these products in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using them.  </li>
      <li>And while my skin is healthy - my morning and evening routine with these products has gotten me closer to my ultimate goal:</li>
      <li>I have only had a fabulous experience with Tree of Life Beauty products and customer service!</li>
      <li>it states the percentage of Vit C, but thinking it is higher than the HA since it is higher on the list than the HA.</li>
      <li>It is a cloudy yellow in color, very watery, (normal for some serums), but the dropper makes it very easy to use a drop on cheeks, forehead and chin, massage in then use an extra drop or two in places that need more attention, around eyes or lips.</li>
      <li>I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review.</li>
      <li>This Tree of Life Brand sent us a free anti-aging e-book via email, shortly after purchase.</li>
      <li>I was really blown away by the quality of this serum.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it so much I bought other products from this company.</li>
      <li>I would say this tilts towards the cosmetic and recommend it for immediate results, but would suggest finding something to use with it that contains more active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A soft, silky feel that penetrates quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It left skin very soft, smooth, and glowing.</li>
      <li>Plus, I LOVE the price of these, especially when there are these kinds of discounts and discounts for buying multiple products, since I always buy in bulk!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I can see myself in a product from use, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been applying it heavily to my under-eye areas to see if it will help minimize the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and gosh, I really think it did.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin which cannot tolerate some Vitamin C serums, but this one is fine.&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ever used so far, and I&#x27;ve used a lot!  </li>
      <li>My skin is looking more even and my deep forehead lines seem to be getting less noticable.  </li>
      <li>: I’d clear it for all types.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is very nice. Goes on nicely, spreads nice and id say a lot goes a long way! My skin not only felt soft, it actually looked soft. I am very pleased with it and will continue using this product. Also like the smell!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to say that the serum was great, however, I dropped it and it spilled after only one use!</li>
    <li> Gave this is a gift to my mother and she loves the fact that her skin is starting to even out and have fewer dark spots after a week of using!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel great!</li>
    <li> I take Vitamin C tablets so why not apply some Vitamin C to your skin?  I have used other Vit C serums.  I do like this one from Tree of Life Beauty!  It doesn&#x27;t seem sticky or tacky when it soaks in and you can go about your day ( I&#x27;m retired) without putting makeup on top. It hydrates &amp; hopefully feeds my face.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate or sting.  I&#x27;ll use this one everyday!  I did receive this a reduced cost for an honest opinion &amp; I&#x27;m so glad! Thank You!</li>
    <li> I just received this particular product,but due to my previous experience with this brand, I feel certain it will meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and all previous products have been excellent!</li>
    <li> I have just been using it for 3 weeks and so far I do like the way it feels on my skin. Can&#x27;t wait to see if it fades my brown spots.</li>
    <li> As a product tester I compare dozens of skin care products, and I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations from fragrance to long-term results. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Hard to place - smells like cinnamon with undertones of witch hazel. No added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;~ Color and texture: Slightly cloudy tan color. It’s thin, but has a gel feel going on.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Slippery and moist.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Smooth, soft.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: I’d clear it for all types. Not oily or drying. I have very sensitive skin which cannot tolerate some Vitamin C serums, but this one is fine.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: Amber glass bottle with glass squeeze dropper.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Skin is visibly smoother and there is a noticeable reduction in depth of fine wrinkles. This is what got it its five-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid are the mainstays of this serum. These will both help your skin long-term. I would say this tilts towards the cosmetic and recommend it for immediate results, but would suggest finding something to use with it that contains more active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;~ Other notes: This exact formula seems to be marketed under a number of brand names including this one, Elleda, and Majestic Pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review. I was not paid for my review, or given any incentive or reward for a positive review.

    <li> My Vitamin C Serum arrived on time. It is an awesome product.  Not greasy or oily feeling. It makes my skin really smooth.  I Love it. I give it 4 star rating.</li>
    <li> The best serum so far! It makes skin soft and smooth! Observe into skin quickly And makes skin supple!!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at discount price for review but this opinion is my own nothing to do with discount!!</li>
    <li> Best Vitamin C Serum I have tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;In the past year, I have tried probably about 20 Vitamin C serums and while some of them were pretty decent, none were as effective and as absolutely gorgeously smelling as the Alina one. I was really blown away by the quality of this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on silky smooth, it&#x27;s not too thick nor too liquidy, it smells divine and it actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve been using it religiously for over 10 days now, as I always evaluate all skin care products for about 7-10 days before sharing my opinion, and honestly, I have no plans of switching to anything else. My skin feels replenished, revitalized, refreshed and just all around rejuvenated. I&#x27;ve been applying it heavily to my under-eye areas to see if it will help minimize the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, and gosh, I really think it did. Significantly! I am beyond thrilled to have discovered this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is this one of the most effective vitamin C serums out there, it&#x27;s also the best smelling one I have ever used. Some vitamin C serums smell merely tolerable, most smell like something that died in your grandmas medicine cabinet, this one? It smells like freshly peeled citrus. Ever used the Grapefruit face scrub from YES TO? This serum smells exactly like that. It&#x27;s such a fresh, energizing smell, I can&#x27;t get enough of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see more products from this brand - I will definitely be purchasing more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of the product for evaluation purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Since I started using this my skin has become very smooth.  I love the way it absorbs quickly.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I just got it and already starting to see the difference. The serum is helping diminish the wrinkles around and under my eyes as well as the deep creases around my mouth. .I&#x27;m also starting to see the lines in my forehead soften and get smaller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for testing purposes. All of my reviews are honest and unbiased.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this product it made my skin look more alive and softer and brighter.</li>
    <li> My aunt absolutely loves this product and will buy more when she runs out.. Cant say enough great things about it! Thank you for the awesome product :)</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Serum was delivered protectively packaged and in excellent condition.  We purchased the serum in a promotion to test and review.  My mom and I have both been using Vitamin C Serum for several years, and we really like that this brand uses organic ingredients, and vegan Hyaluronic acid as well.  Especially nice as a moisturizer following Retinol treatment.  This Tree of Life Brand sent us a free anti-aging e-book via email, shortly after purchase.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve waited so long to try Vitamin C Serum, but I not swear but this stuff! Given the sunburn protection, it&#x27;s a great addition to my skin care regimen - because I love getting that sun-activated vitamin D. That it fights antioxidants and free radicals is a bonus, but in terms of what I&#x27;ve seen in my short-term use is brighter skin! I see a glow, friends have commented on it. Oh, I may&#x27;ve received this at a discounted rate for an honest review, but I&#x27;m definitely hooked as a customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all of the Tree of Life products and I absolutely love them, with the exception of this. I&#x27;m not sure if I received an expired batch or what, but it smelled awful like a house fire, and made my skin break out. I used it twice in 2 days, and left my face broken out for 2 weeks. I returned it no problem. I won&#x27;t try this again, but I will stick with all my other Tree of Life products! The Retinol cream does wonders for your skin!</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum smooth and calm my face. I have very mild redness on my face. Applied this a few days and the redness is gone. My skin is glowing instead of a red face. It also smoothes my skin. A soft, silky feel that penetrates quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product with a discount to provide my honest feedback.</li>
    <li> I have only had a fabulous experience with Tree of Life Beauty products and customer service! If I could add more stars to rate them, I would. Somehow 5 stars just isn&#x27;t enough.&lt;br /&gt;I am a 54 year old female. And while my skin is healthy - my morning and evening routine with these products has gotten me closer to my ultimate goal: Have great looking skin without makeup! Tree of Life Beauty products makes that end goal attainable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using their products for only a month by the way...I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the price is a great deal! Throw away your other products - you simply won&#x27;t need them.</li>
    <li> Applying Vit. C serum on my face is part of my daily routine for a healthier skin . I&#x27;d been prone to having acne outbreak and my dermatologist told me the importance of vitamin C in my skin. This product helps keep my skin healthier and its a must have in my beauty cabinet.</li>
    <li> You have to try this it is amazing!! You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for hyperpigmentation. I am an African American woman, the older I get -the easier my skin scars. I have tried everything from Skinceuticals to Estée Lauder to eminence to Nuetrogena, and nothing has worked. I ran across this, and decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3.5 weeks, and saw immediate results. My skin looked brighter within the first couple days. My acne scars are almost gone. I barely need concealer anymore. This is a miracle in a bottle, and I am a pretty harsh reviewer. I noticed that I have only a few days left in my first bottle, and panicked. I just ordered more, and am planning on trying a few more of their products.</li>
    <li> This serum is magical... moisturizing and makes my skin glow! :)</li>
    <li> I love it! Love it so much I bought other products from this company.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum has a lot of benefits.  It is great for your skin and complexion.  My skin feels softer and appears more resilient. I didn&#x27;t order this particular one, but have ordered other things from this company and it has been great.  I was asked to leave a review via email so that is what I am doing.</li>
    <li> I have patches of very dry skin on my face and have tried multiple products without real relief.  This product is great.  It clears the dry and red skin on my face and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  I use it twice a day and this even helps with wrinkles.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really do love these products in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using them.  The serums are my favorite.  And I&#x27;m excited to try the Scar Cream on my acne scars on my face and I want to see if it works for my strech marks on my belly from my prenancies.  I started using all of these products on my belly a couple of days ago to see if they help reduce the appearance of my stretch marks and help the sagging belly skin from my pregnancies as well.  I also love how these help keep my skin clearer from acne and blackheads, my pores are starting to look smaller, my skin isn&#x27;t as oily and my dark spots are fading.  I can almost go out without any face powder cover up now.  My skin is looking more even and my deep forehead lines seem to be getting less noticable.  Best skin care I&#x27;ve ever used so far, and I&#x27;ve used a lot!  Plus, I LOVE the price of these, especially when there are these kinds of discounts and discounts for buying multiple products, since I always buy in bulk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had acne prone skin that has a lot of texture and that gets super oily.  I took accutane as a teenager but I still get hormonal acne and I&#x27;ll be 40 next year!  I started getting age spots as well and deep wrinkels in my forehead (expression lines) that I wasn&#x27;t too happy about on top of the acne.  This whole skin care line is so great and makes my skin look and feel amazing!  I LOVE it and am so glad I found it!</li>
    <li> Packaged in a 1 ounce, brown glass bottle with a dropper. Ingredient list is as follows: Organic Herbal Infusion, Aloe, Vit C, MSM, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, Vit E, Carbomer, 2-Amino-5-Guanidinopentanoic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Jojoba Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin. I can not find anywhere it states the percentage of Vit C, but thinking it is higher than the HA since it is higher on the list than the HA. The Vit C is Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate since it is a more stable form of Vit C than L-Ascorbic Acid. Serums with Ascorbic Acid in them have a very short shelf life it starts oxidizing immediately and become completely ineffective in a few short weeks, if that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this one for 4 nights now and 3 mornings. It is a cloudy yellow in color, very watery, (normal for some serums), but the dropper makes it very easy to use a drop on cheeks, forehead and chin, massage in then use an extra drop or two in places that need more attention, around eyes or lips. If you use the dropper properly you never waste a drop. It left skin very soft, smooth, and glowing. I cannot say it has lightened anything such as sun spots. I do think it has evened out the skin tone where it was not even in places. It has helped with the firmness in my eye area and pores are less noticeable and appear smaller. I had no irritation at all, and have moderate sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using tons of different Vit C serums over the years, (yes I am over 50), this one is at the top of my list. I have seen a visual difference in a short time. It takes at least a month to see any difference over time with any product, but some that do have any effect in just a few days for the better are few and far between and this one does just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.
