      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Great toenail clippers.</li>
      <li>I thought that since the tweezerman brand makes quality products that this toenail clipper would be great.</li>
      <li>Very nice.  </li>
      <li>Amazing product!</li>
      <li>Nice build quality!</li>
      <li>Good product as discribed</li>
      <li>Tweezerman is always good quality too.</li>
      <li>know who is making this product for Tweezerman or where they&#x27;re being made, but whoever and wherever, they&#x27;re not doing a good job of it.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, good nail clippers</li>
      <li>These are definitely good quality nail clippers.</li>
      <li>good clippers - but-</li>
      <li>Good cutter but be cafefull</li>
      <li>it works good.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with the&lt;br /&gt;clippers.</li>
      <li>It does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should own a pair of these toenail clippers.</li>
      <li>I bought two, as they seem to grow their own legs and walk off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are nice tweezers that do their job.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;To be honest, I bought this to use for clipping monofilament line.  </li>
      <li>Good price, good quality, quick to ship.</li>
      <li>And these clippers did work great for the first 3-4 uses over a period of about a month or two</li>
      <li>I finally had to search online and am so happy I found them here!</li>
      <li>the blade is a different shape than I&#x27;m used to, but it works wonderfully!</li>
      <li>I am ordering two more sets for travel.</li>
      <li>I love these for my toes.  </li>
      <li>, they cut the nails very cleanly and easily...</li>
      <li>It was shared with me years ago, that they were the best style of clippers if you were an active runner.</li>
      <li>excellent well made product, straight edge as podiatrist recommended, well weighted, size appropriate for any size hands, including male hands</li>
      <li>I opened them and was immediately impressed with the quality, heavy and weighted feel, and comfort in my hand.  </li>
      <li>Clipper is sturdy like the ones we had before: nothing cheap about them.</li>
      <li>They are the same name arrive on time good condition.</li>
      <li>Over all not a bad product.</li>
      <li>I have switched to my toenails, actually not a bad product for the damn toes.</li>
      <li>Clips nails like hot knife a butter!</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, they couldn&#x27;t cut the line using the left side of the clipper (as viewed from the top) but did okay on the right side.  </li>
      <li>Smooth, super convenient sharp and effective.</li>
      <li>These are definitely worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>That may be true, but so far, it works just fine.</li>
      <li>Decent price as i got them as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; so free shipping.</li>
      <li>shipping was quick, Very sturdy, Works well</li>
      <li>sharp and easy to use but for sure not \\&quot;straight edge\\&quot;</li>
      <li>At first thought this maybe  </li>
      <li>first I thought this is used for finger nails.</li>
      <li>I knew the Tweezerman had a good name and reputation, so I decided to try these next, even though they were more than I usually paid.  </li>
      <li>I what I really needed for, but still works somehow.</li>
      <li>I bought these because I couldn&#x27;t find the clippers with a straight edge anywhere in the stores.</li>
      <li>i recently bought this toenail clipper just to receive free shipping</li>
      <li>We needed the straight cut because it stops us from having ingrown toe nails.  </li>
      <li>They work very well.  </li>
      <li>I Couldn&#x27;t find clippers with the straight blade anywhere in town.</li>
      <li>I have a teenager i couldn&#x27;t get to understand that straight toenails don&#x27;t get ingrown.</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t want a concave clipper, but neither did i want a convex clipper.</li>
      <li>Slightly convex.  </li>
      <li>too much else</li>
      <li>HEAVY , FITS IN POKECT NICELY .</li>
      <li>Like most other clippers it works well.</li>
      <li>A strong, heavy clipper that will be sure to last and without any problems.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>They do the job are sharp and easy to use.</li>
      <li>In other words smooth cut.</li>
      <li>I was clipping my own nails, and I&#x27;m a woman, so they&#x27;d likely not last that long for a man.</li>
      <li>Gave them one more shot a week later, and same result and jagged edges left on my nails.  </li>
      <li>Plus, I&#x27;m not sure sure it&#x27;s even a problem that sharpening would solve.</li>
      <li>and I have been pleasantly surprised!</li>
      <li>Clearly the people who design and market</li>
      <li>These replaced a pair that had far outseen it&#x27;s day.</li>
      <li>They are described as \\&quot;straight edge\\&quot;, but actually are curved out.  </li>
      <li>But wow -- when I used them, they were like hedge clippers -- instead of neatly clipping my nails, they seemed to splinter and crush them instead.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reason for that, but when I&#x27;m forced to use these</li>
      <li>However, a full cut would actually curve exactly opposite regular clippers so that&#x27;d prevent in-growns as well.</li>
      <li>although their edges dull and splinter easily, they cut uniformly across their width.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These tweezerman clippers are pretty much a throwaway now, since although tweezerman offers free sharpening, the cost of postage to mail them in would probably equal the cost of the clippers by the second sharpening, and at the rate that these clippers go dull, it would make absolutely no sense to send them in for sharpening.</li>
      <li>I always seem to misplace my clippers and need to buy new several times a year.  </li>
      <li>The only difference between these and the pair they replaced is that the old pair had the under nail cleaner and nail file.</li>
      <li>Edge is slightly convex, not straight as advertised.  </li>
      <li>The Straight edge is heavier than I expected &amp; has a &amp;#34;v&amp;#34; shaped notch in it, which I think is a flaw.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kinda straight but still not completely straight across like I&#x27;d hoped</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s always a chance for operator error, no matter how simple and obvious the tool, so I repeated the attempt to cut 8# fishing line several times with the same results each time: left side, no go; right side, cuts</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly and well packaged, as Amazon items usually are.  </li>
      <li>My only warning is to be careful because they are super sharp.  </li>
      <li>The leverage on these clippers is so great that they are actually dangerous!</li>
      <li>The old pair of clippers I had, I used for at least 8 years, and they&#x27;ve always cut well without needing sharpening, I doubt they&#x27;re even that sharp, but somehow they cut cleanly.</li>
      <li>It works but convex shape of cutters takes a little getting used to.  </li>
      <li>I knocked off one star for the simple fact that, although the description says they&#x27;re straight edge, they are almost a little outward-bulging.</li>
      <li>I bought these clippers as a replacement for a similar convex edge style  clipper I&#x27;ve been using for years that was starting to look a little ragged.</li>

<li> With just a bit of patience can be used to ensure a straight cut with short, shallow cuts.    </li>
<li> Very sharp with large enough openings for big thick toe nails,  Not starigh accross design.  </li>
<li> but it is larger than expected.</li>
<li> There are several mentions here about these clippers splintering the nails or leaving rough cuts, and that&#x27;s what mine do, too.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am by no means a nail clipper connoisseur, but these things suck. The cutting edge curves exactly opposite of how nail clippers should curve, so it takes about 12 cuts to get a normal nail, instead of 4 or 5. Just absolutely stupid product design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be a great set of clippers for fishing line! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;</li>
    <li> Good product as discribed</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Comparing to a regular clipper this one is like a space ship! Smooth, super convenient sharp and effective. Clips nails like hot knife a butter!</li>
    <li> It is heavy duty and straight, but my nails needed filing afterwards. I had to order a curved one. I willing to admit that since I&#x27;m not a professional, I probably don&#x27;t know how to use this correctly, but how hard should cutting toes be?</li>
    <li> Clipper is sturdy like the ones we had before: nothing cheap about them. We needed the straight cut because it stops us from having ingrown toe nails.  If I ever need them again, I will be buying here.</li>
    <li> These replaced a pair that had far outseen it&#x27;s day. They do the job are sharp and easy to use. The only difference between these and the pair they replaced is that the old pair had the under nail cleaner and nail file. YMMV.</li>
    <li> Not \\&quot;straight\\&quot; at all, and now I have to buy another one. The picture here on Amazon is not the product that I got.</li>
    <li> I Couldn&#x27;t find clippers with the straight blade anywhere in town. I love these for my toes.  Tweezerman is always good quality too.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these in an area store, happy to have them.  It was shared with me years ago, that they were the best style of clippers if you were an active runner.</li>
    <li> It is NOT a straight edge.  It curves inward.  Returned it.  Took a LONG time to be refunded.  Will not shop there again!</li>
    <li> Works well but it is larger than expected. It is perfect for hang nails.</li>
    <li> These clippers are an oddity.  They are described as \\&quot;straight edge\\&quot;, but actually are curved out.  To me, that doesn&#x27;t make sense for clipping nails. I didn&#x27;t expect any clipper could clip inward, but that was my oversight.  They are well made and sharp, though.</li>
    <li> Cut my toe nails without stalling. In other words smooth cut. Here is the catch I think they sent me a more expensive clipper than one pictured. One I got has a black handle on it.. At first thought this maybe  a problem  but I excepted the handle it works good. I just had to adjust to a Clipper with a black handle.. They are the same name arrive on time good condition. I am very satisfied with the&lt;br /&gt;clippers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda straight but still not completely straight across like I&#x27;d hoped</li>
    <li> The leverage on these clippers is so great that they are actually dangerous! I used them once, thus would never return them. I regret the purchase.</li>
    <li> These are definitely good quality nail clippers. I knocked off one star for the simple fact that, although the description says they&#x27;re straight edge, they are almost a little outward-bulging. So if I were to clip in the middle of my nail, it would be u-shaped, not straight. Otherwise, good nail clippers</li>
    <li> Like most other clippers it works well. I bought these because I couldn&#x27;t find the clippers with a straight edge anywhere in the stores.</li>
    <li> I got for the boys as I have had a pair since 1967, and it finally broke. I hope these last as long</li>
    <li> It works but convex shape of cutters takes a little getting used to.  Doesn&#x27;t cut nails any better or worse than other quality brands.</li>
    <li> These work well, I&#x27;m very pleased. I always buy tweezerman products, as for me, they r the best tweezers &amp; clippers</li>
    <li> I bought two, as they seem to grow their own legs and walk off.&lt;br /&gt;These are similar to the ones I lost and now it&#x27;s utopia again.</li>
    <li> With just a bit of patience can be used to ensure a straight cut with short, shallow cuts.    However, a full cut would actually curve exactly opposite regular clippers so that&#x27;d prevent in-growns as well.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers as a replacement for a similar convex edge style  clipper I&#x27;ve been using for years that was starting to look a little ragged. I thought that since the tweezerman brand makes quality products that this toenail clipper would be great. And these clippers did work great for the first 3-4 uses over a period of about a month or two, they cut the nails very cleanly and easily...BUT...then they started to split my nails, leaving very, very rough &amp; ragged edges. Just awful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tweezerman clippers are pretty much a throwaway now, since although tweezerman offers free sharpening, the cost of postage to mail them in would probably equal the cost of the clippers by the second sharpening, and at the rate that these clippers go dull, it would make absolutely no sense to send them in for sharpening. Plus, I&#x27;m not sure sure it&#x27;s even a problem that sharpening would solve. The old pair of clippers I had, I used for at least 8 years, and they&#x27;ve always cut well without needing sharpening, I doubt they&#x27;re even that sharp, but somehow they cut cleanly. This is a terrible clipper, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> shipping was quick, Very sturdy, Works well</li>
    <li> The edge actually curves out, which is weird. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a reason for that, but when I&#x27;m forced to use these it looks like I cut my toenails while panicked and blind drunk.</li>
    <li> The Straight edge is heavier than I expected &amp; has a &amp;#34;v&amp;#34; shaped notch in it, which I think is a flaw.</li>
    <li> good clippers - but- i didn&#x27;t want a concave clipper, but neither did i want a convex clipper. sharp and easy to use but for sure not \\&quot;straight edge\\&quot;</li>
    <li> first I thought this is used for finger nails. but I was wrong I brought this product and tried to use it on my finger nails hard to use, and I looked at the product it said is a toenail clipper, so I have switched to my toenails, actually not a bad product for the damn toes. lol, over all I give it 3 stare is because I didn&#x27;t get the thing I what I really needed for, but still works somehow. Over all not a bad product.</li>
    <li> Nice build quality! Very sharp and go right through thick nails. Can&#x27;t understand why manufactures put curved clippers in packages for toe nails!? These are definitely worth the purchase. I am ordering two more sets for travel.</li>
    <li> A strong, heavy clipper that will be sure to last and without any problems. This is a must have for very thick nails.</li>
    <li> Yes, I think I saw others that said this was not stainless steel. That may be true, but so far, it works just fine.</li>
    <li> excellent well made product, straight edge as podiatrist recommended, well weighted, size appropriate for any size hands, including male hands</li>
    <li> I have had very good luck with Tweezerman products, and these clippers are no exception.  They work very well.  My only warning is to be careful because they are super sharp.  The first time I used them I ended up with a cut that I didn&#x27;t even realize had happened until it was too late!!</li>
    <li> i recently bought this toenail clipper just to receive free shipping and I have been pleasantly surprised! the blade is a different shape than I&#x27;m used to, but it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Very sharp with large enough openings for big thick toe nails,  Not starigh accross design.  Slightly convex.  Good cutter but be cafefull you don&#x27;t cut your skin.</li>
    <li> As others have said, not a straight edge. Got by with it for awhile, but I just broke the thing trying to clip the nail on one of my big toes. Picture attached.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I always seem to misplace my clippers and need to buy new several times a year.  I knew the Tweezerman had a good name and reputation, so I decided to try these next, even though they were more than I usually paid.  They arrived quickly and well packaged, as Amazon items usually are.  I opened them and was immediately impressed with the quality, heavy and weighted feel, and comfort in my hand.  But wow -- when I used them, they were like hedge clippers -- instead of neatly clipping my nails, they seemed to splinter and crush them instead.  Gave them one more shot a week later, and same result and jagged edges left on my nails.  Just not my style of clipper.  5 stars for quality and feel, no stars for clipping results &#x3D; 2 stars from me.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does an amazing job.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should own a pair of these toenail clippers. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Edge is slightly convex, not straight as advertised.  It is enough to make it not effective.  I will have to try a different product.  Not sure why it&#x27;s so hard to find.  Clearly the people who design and market this product don&#x27;t need to use it.</li>
    <li> Great toenail clippers. They do their job with ease and efficiency, not too much else you can say about toenail clippers...</li>
    <li> After 3 uses on only my big toes, not the smaller ones, these clippers fell apart at the hinge. I was clipping my own nails, and I&#x27;m a woman, so they&#x27;d likely not last that long for a man. I have reassembled them several times, but they fall apart again even before applying any pressure.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, it is hard to find straight edge toenail clippers in any typical drug store. I finally had to search online and am so happy I found them here!</li>
    <li> Is curved outward.  It is not straight edge.  Deceptive/mislabled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW HARD IS THAT TO PUT ON THE PACKAGE?</li>
    <li> A GREAT PRODUCT !&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO USE , DOES WHAT A SUPPOSE TO .&lt;br /&gt;SHARP , DOES NOT LEAVE ROUGH EDGES .&lt;br /&gt;NOT HEAVY , FITS IN POKECT NICELY .</li>
    <li> Gee whiz!  Who would have thought that you needed to read the reviews on toenail clippers!!!  These are NOT straight.  They are convex which is even worse than the concave ones you usually see.</li>
    <li> Why are these so hard to find in stores? I have a teenager i couldn&#x27;t get to understand that straight toenails don&#x27;t get ingrown. These do the thinking for her lol. Decent price as i got them as an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; so free shipping.</li>
    <li> Good price, good quality, quick to ship.</li>
    <li> These are nice tweezers that do their job.  They are sharp and provide the power needed to perform their job well.</li>
    <li> There are obvious manufacturing defects in the clipper I received: the \\&quot;cutting edges\\&quot; do not meet uniformly across their width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I bought this to use for clipping monofilament line.  The first time I used it, they couldn&#x27;t cut the line using the left side of the clipper (as viewed from the top) but did okay on the right side.  There&#x27;s always a chance for operator error, no matter how simple and obvious the tool, so I repeated the attempt to cut 8# fishing line several times with the same results each time: left side, no go; right side, cuts fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried using them on my nails and the defect is very obvious with the left side leaving a ragged, \\&quot;torn\\&quot;, edge.  There are several mentions here about these clippers splintering the nails or leaving rough cuts, and that&#x27;s what mine do, too.  I&#x27;m presuming it&#x27;s because the jaws, and therefore the cutting edges, are not very parallel to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The less-than-a-dollar clippers in the supermarket are, at least, made with the cutting edges parallel - although their edges dull and splinter easily, they cut uniformly across their width.  It can&#x27;t be rocket science to assemble these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know who is making this product for Tweezerman or where they&#x27;re being made, but whoever and wherever, they&#x27;re not doing a good job of it.  These are crap at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> The only shortcoming for me is that the cutter opening is not sufficiently wide, cutters don&#x27;t open wide enough for thick toenails, of which I have some.</li>
