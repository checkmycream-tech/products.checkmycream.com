<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product is as expected.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get some incense-type of smelling perfume (oil).. when I took my first sniff it was terrible! I don&#x27;t even know how to describe the smell, it is not even close to patchouli it&#x27;s like a rough, tough, cleaner, something I could find in a garage. I hate to be so &amp;#34;frank&amp;#34; but it is true. I burn patchouli and nag champa almost daily so I know what they smell like. THIS ISN&#x27;T IT, do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Having this brand of Patchouli previously for several years inspired me to purchase it again. . . . .WRONG!!!  The brand/company has changed hands [I found out later] and they have changed the \\&quot;oil\\&quot; to &#x27;scented water&#x27; !!  And even worse, the scent is NOT  the same!  So do not be fooled, as I was, with brand names.</li>
    <li> Years ago I had a little bottle of Patchouly oil I&#x27;d bought at the Renaissance Faire.  I loved it, but got rid of it because my lover at the time was severely allergic to any kind of scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the lover a long time ago.  A few days ago, I found myself thinking about the smell of Patchouly oil and realizing that I missed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember the brand Spiritual Sky from my youth.  I rarely wear perfume of any kind, but I do still love the way this smells.</li>
    <li> nice item, smells good, makes me remember the 60&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Scent does not last too long, but it does smell good.</li>
    <li> A good patchouli is hard to find!  Most are overpowering.  This scent is NOT overpowering and mixes well with other scents if you&#x27;re into mixing and matching.  It&#x27;s clean and seductive.  I love it, my man loves it.  I mix it with other perfume oils and the outcome is always great.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best!!!</li>
    <li> does not last..scent gone after a couple of hours</li>
    <li> i was the biggest fan of spiritual sky patchouli years ago. i was extremely excited when i saw it again listed for sale. when it arrived and i opened the pkg THAT&#x27;S when i learned from a note in the pkg. that the patchouli formula had changed when spiritual sky sold their name and co. it smelled absolutely nothing like the many bottles of spiritual sky i had bought over the years. in fact the smell was awful. it wouldve cost me more to ship it back than it did for the oil itself, so i threw it away.</li>
    <li> I love the small bottles...will be buying more.....</li>
    <li> I love this oil and have been using this brand for years.</li>
    <li> Not like Spiritual Sky products of the past we&#x27;ve bought. Weak fragrance. Used to be stronger. Maybe a bad batch?</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Patchouly oils are tricky.  The fragrance can be very weak or not smell like patchouly at all! This product is perfect and its concentrated so a little goes a long way.  I always get compliments when I wear it.  It has become my signature scent.I&#x27;ll keep buying this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this patchouly, very natural and stay with me all day long.</li>
    <li> Have bought this for years and always happy until now. Smells nothing like patchouly. Very disappointed. Would not purchase again or recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> NOT what I remember.........I will be throwing it away. Smells NOTHING like the Spiritual Sky from years ago. I am very disappointed I was really looking forward to it..</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start this review on a very strong note...haven&#x27;t bought the Patchouly scent by Spiritual Sky since the mid 90&#x27;s.I&#x27;m a cologne man myself but something deep down gives a craving for the earthy scent of Patchouli.Moving on I have a few critical notes to make about a few reviews that lean to the 1 to 3 star ratings.The first is the most helpful reviewer with the title &#x27;Dissapointed&#x27;.So let me get this straight their seller sent them a note with the product they purchased downing what they ordered to deter another consumer&#x27;s business?...I sense a liar among that review.Secondly,is the 3-star who describes this scent as &#x27;a cigar box with a little patchouli in it&#x27;...I somewhat share this individual&#x27;s opinion to an extent.So on that note I agree that this current Patchouly made by Gonesh (current owner/manufacturer of Spiritual Sky) is different from what I remember.The only differential is this patchouli oil hasn&#x27;t been aged enough (and never was advertised as such) but yes the old Spiritual Sky just happened to be aged long enough to develop more rawer/earthy tones.And when you buy any patchouli oil they will vary in scent variable depending if it&#x27;s aged or not and will mention that as a selling point.You can still &#x27;age&#x27; this patchouli oil by Spiritual Sky just tuck it away like any bottle of wine for a year or two and it will mature on it&#x27;s own.Made in the USA,still thick and oily and not watery.This patchouli will have a semi-cedary tone but vibrantly green and earthy.In truth I should dock a star for not being matured enough but it&#x27;s still a pleasant Patchouly by Spiritual Sky...rich enough to wear and enjoy so I can&#x27;t discredit it.Here&#x27;s my advice-buy one bottle and try it as-is.If you don&#x27;t like it keep the lid on tight and stick it in a drawer and forget about it.Move on to an aged patchouli then try it again in 1 to 3 years and tell me if this oil deserves the negative criticism.</li>
    <li> I only wear this patchouli oil and have for years. I love this brand.  Amazon always comes through with the best products and service!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where this stuff comes from, but woe does it smell bad to me!  Smells like gasoline with an after afect that smells like mold spores. If it is popular, I wonder who it is popular with? Tom&#x27;s Incense is a great store, but this oil smells really bad! Very strong smell that you can&#x27;t wash off. Patchouly peu!!</li>
    <li> Love love love Patchouly and always will!!! A timeless favorite! If you like musk you may like it! However any scent is a very PERSONAL thing for the buyer.  NOW, regardless of how much I LOVE Patchouly, I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with this one that I bought from this seller!!!!!!! I know I am writing this very very late and I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review at all... but I just couldn&#x27;t let it go!!! It smells very chemically ! NOT authentic at all!!! TRUST ME... I KNOW MY PATCHOULY and this one is NOT it!!!! The Spiritual Sky label didn&#x27;t look authentic either in person. I wish I could find my old &amp;quot;Spiritual Sky ORIGINAL&amp;quot; one, I got at a fair many many years ago and compare the two!!! It&#x27;ll turn up eventually! I don&#x27;t know which one to try now as my trust is nil but I&#x27;ll just have to give one or two more a try until I find the authentic one out there regardless of cost!!! And this time if it&#x27;s no good IT WILL go back and I&#x27;ll post right away!!! Maybe by some chance my batch was bad... who knows... I just know, it DID NOT smell right! Sorry and VERY disappointed I was so looking forward to it!!! Oh well...</li>
    <li> DELIGHTED WITH THIS OIL ! I ORDERED 3 BOTTLES AND ONE I GAVE AS A GIFT .&lt;br /&gt;THE RECIPIENT ALSO WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE QUAILITY OF THE OIL AND THE&lt;br /&gt;PATCHOULY SCENT BEING TRUE TO ITS NAME.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted cause is the same she used to were in her 15&#x27;s..</li>
    <li> It seems there is no middle ground regarding a person&#x27;s reaction to this scent.  One either loves it, or one hates it.  I happen to love it.  And Tom&#x27;s Incense is a great seller.  :)</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Patchouli (by Spiritual Sky) for the past 30+ years. I have been addicted since 1978, at the age of 14. Ok, so I gave my age away Ü....my mother tells me \\&quot;you smell like dirt\\&quot; (in her mind, this is fresh earth). Yeah, I can see her point but I&#x27;ll live the rest of my life wearing this stuff Ü. I also use Dragons Blood along with Patchouli when I want a sweet, spicy scent.</li>
    <li> Not that great. Price is good.</li>
    <li> Not Pure Pathchouly,contains additives and perfumes.. Smells like the real deal, but not the pure essential oil. Price is right</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume oil since the age of 15 and I am 58 now, and surprisingly the price hasn&#x27;t changed that much! I will definately keep buying this oil and even other different oils again!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> The Spiritual Sky Patchouly oil is the best on the market. It has always been my favorite of any I have ever used! For only a small amount of money and a small amount of oil...it is amazing how long it last!!!! It is very concentrated and has a beautifully powerful scent, therefore you do not have to use but a tiny amount. This is an excellent buy for anyone who loves the mysterious, spicy aroma perfumes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear patchouly but a friend does and I bought her one too. I ended up giving her both bottles. I like it but it has a bit of a &#x27;bite&#x27; to the scent that doesn&#x27;t change even after putting it on and letting it warm up to my pH. If anyone knows of a way to make this more &#x27;warmer&#x27; I&#x27;d be interested in ideas. But it&#x27;s the closest thing to the real Spiritual Sky of years ago that&#x27;s no longer made.</li>
    <li> This is it! The same Spiritual Sky bottle... the same Spiritual Sky scent. It&#x27;s 1970 all over again. Although I may be one of the few remaining, it&#x27;s home and youth and freespiritedness and love for this ex-hippie chick all over again. I don&#x27;t care WHO holds their nose. I&#x27;m happy. :) Peace.</li>
    <li> I was happy to see that I could get my favorite brand of Patchouly via Amazon.  This brand of oils has a pleasant, long-lasting scent.</li>
    <li> Smells completely different from the &amp;#34;Spiritual Sky&amp;#34; Patchouly I bought about 40 years ago!!  I was told that no one sells the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; anymore but my old one DID smell real.  So I was really hoping that this bottle would be the same.  It wasn&#x27;t!  Oh well, guess they were right!</li>
    <li> This is a nice oil for those who love the smell of Patchouli like I do. I actually prefer the patchouli musk because it smelles better though. This is the traditional patchouli scent with no additives. Great stuff, reminds me of the goog old days.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s perfume, she gets many, many compliments on the smell of it and they always ask, what is your perfume. Once again you don&#x27;t have to purchase the expensive perfumes to smell good and I love it too.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell.  Reminds me of days past and the husband of my youth.  He still smells great wearing it.  A little drop goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over do it!</li>
    <li> Same high quaility aromatic oilI purchased in my 70&#x27;s  hippie days. I love the smell of this stuff! I used to wear so much of this stuff, I had a cloud around me, not very subtle....</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Spiritual Sky patchouli for decades, along with Spiritual Sky&#x27;s sandalwood. Spiritual Sky is the only oil perfumes that do not irritate my skin and its not overwhelming to others! Spiritual Sky is the best!</li>
    <li> Spiritual Sky Patchouli Oil used to be the best hands down, BUT, they changed the ingredients because of price cost. The new product is off color and doesnt compare. Take it from an avid Spiritual Sky user for eons. I wish the company would read this and change it back. I&#x27;d be willing to pay the extra just to have the old blend back.  The new stuff is junk..  The patchouli kid......</li>
    <li> Love it!! Brought me back to my teenage years! This is what I wore in the 70&#x27;s. Thank you lots</li>
    <li> Total crap. Synthetic fragrance not oil. Compared to bottle bought from original spiritual sky company, color completely different, synthetic ingredients on label. If any of you have original bottles left of S.Sky patchouli on the label seen thru bottle it says natural concentrated essential oil. This stuff iDipropylene Gycol, Fragance, D&amp;C coloring. Total bummer. Smells like old wet clothes.</li>
    <li> Used to get this all the time when I was young. Don&#x27;t know weather I have changed or it has been watered down but it just didn&#x27;t smell as good (or quite right) as I had remembered. I have other brands I like better. Price was good, shipping was fast, thanks to the seller.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived damaged so contents spilled over everything, but the scent was true and over powering. Found it awkward to resolve and would like to.</li>
    <li> beautiful fragrant......people will know you are a hippie at heart</li>
    <li> Very, very concentrated!  This tiny little bottle will last me forever!</li>
    <li> is a product i have loved for 30 years. Happy to find it again  It now sits on my dressing table.</li>
    <li> Great service and product</li>
    <li> Great quality perfume oil.  Patchouly is my favorite scent.  It also seems to be the least-favorite scent for many people.  You&#x27;ll get some comments from them.</li>
    <li> Smells like unaged patchouli cut with tobacco leaves. I like it, but it&#x27;s simply not what I expected or remember what it used to smell like 25 years ago, at all!!&lt;br /&gt;It smells like some splashed a little patchouli oil in a cigar box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect much for $5.00 but this is not simply just patchouli. I&#x27;m getting strong top notes of tobacco and it seems to dry down fast too. I won&#x27;t be buying another bottle of this that&#x27;s for sure. I would like to add this is not a synthetic smelling fragrance it is actually very pleasant and extremely unisex. It is such a neutral scent that doesn&#x27;t lean toward either gender at all. I have premium patchouli oil that is very costly and definetly have some thing to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried layering this with some premium agar wood edp that had dried down to a light skin scent and was almost dead and it actually woke it up a little bit for at least an hour. It was very pleasant as well so I guess it&#x27;s not a total loss since by its self you get a strong skin scent after a half hour.</li>
    <li> good stuff, good price</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and professionally packaged.  Not as strong as my older bottle (which I am still searching for...), but maybe I need to try the Spiritual Sky Patchouly Musk oil and see if that is strong enough.  It&#x27;s still nice and I often put a couple dabs at my 5th Chakra (maybe that&#x27;s not good practice, but it works for me).  It&#x27;s great if you love Patchouly and don&#x27;t want the aroma to be overwhelming.</li>
    <li> as pictured, described</li>
    <li> Very good patchouli smell. I haven&#x27;t found a spiritual sky oil that I&#x27;ve disliked yet so that seems like a good sign.</li>
    <li> I did not like the way this smelled and I Love Patchouly. This does not please my olfactory senses.</li>
    <li> good scent. Not too musky</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I used to buy in a store long ago and still has that wonderful Patchouly scent.</li>
    <li> I love this scent...I will be buying again. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have a bottle of this Patchouli from the 70&#x27;s and I let everyone compare the fragrance. They are both the exact same. Bliss in a bottle! Far out, Man! It&#x27;s Bowie, Pink Floyd and Zeppelin all over again! The only difference is my old bottle cap is square and this has a round cap. Who cares about that anyway. Have a good trip!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that the scent is not at all like the deep rich scent of Airs Patchouly which I am unable to find.</li>
    <li> smelled like the product was old. not what I expected</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband.  He loves this scent, and it smells wonderful on him.  Just when you think that the scent is no longer on your body, some body will ask, &amp;#34;is that Patchouli your wearing?&amp;#34;  So 5 star you get!</li>
    <li> I was glad that my order came so fast, but not that it was leaking.  The oil was sealed and I could smell it before I even took it out of the envelope. I have bought oils online for years and never had that happen before.</li>
    <li> It smells so good like incense!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t the smell I remembered from my youth.  To me, it has a very strong medicinal smell.&lt;br /&gt;The patchouli from years ago had more of a spicy essence.  I think I&#x27;ll be sticking with my tried and true musk&lt;br /&gt;from now on.....</li>
    <li> The product may be small, but all it takes is two small dabs to do the job. This stuff smells great, delivers quick and is a pretty good value. Will definitely be ordering again, even though we already ordered 2 of these.</li>
    <li> Smells great, lasts forever!</li>
    <li> It stinks!!! I was so excited to get this. Its a waste of money its spicy and off smelling nothing similar to the smell of patchouli.</li>
    <li> i was so happy to find this item on here.&lt;br /&gt;i had a bottle from years ago that was misplaced&lt;br /&gt;i wore this all through high school and loved it&lt;br /&gt;brings wonderful mememories</li>
    <li> I agree.  Once Gonesh bought Spiritual Sky they changed the formulation. The previous version had a nice \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; smell, nothing like the present version which smells like carpet cleaner.  I sent back four bottles. I have been informed that Willert was the supplier of the older version, if anyone has a line on Willert Spiritual Sky Patchouly I would like to know.  And for the person that said \\&quot;we don&#x27;t know what patchouly smells like\\&quot;, let&#x27;s just say they are far from a connoisseur. I had to rate it one star just to exit, otherwise it would have been zero.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the nostalgia. I once smelled this particular patchouly at a friends apt 17 yrs ago and I&#x27;ve loved patchouly ever since. It has a nice earthy smell, not too strong or too weak.</li>
    <li> If you want to get authentic Spiritual Sky oils, I would suggest purchasing the oils directly from the authentic manufacturer, who is located in New Zealand.  I have been a customer of theirs for a very long time, and continue to be extremely satisfied.  (The incense is quite nice, as well.)  The price difference is negligible, and the folks at Spiritual Sky are great folks!  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  You may reach them at spiritualskyincense.com.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this scent when I was in high school: the girl sitting next to me wore it, and I asked her what it was. I have loved it since then. The Spiritual Sky patchouly is the best. I&#x27;m very happy with all aspects of this purchase: the product itself, how it was packaged, and the promptness with which it was sent. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> THE SAME WITH THIS ONE.  MY DAUGTER LOVES IT AND SHE HADN&#x27;T BOUGHT IT INA  LONG TIME, SO I GAVE IT TO HER AS A GIFT.  I WILL ORDER MORE OF ALL THREE WHEN NEED BE.</li>
    <li> Very good product and shipping.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT BACK TO 1969</li>
    <li> I have used Spiritual Sky Patchouli oil since the 60&#x27;s.  The quality remains the same, and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, have not been able to find It since the 70&#x27;s, very pleased!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite scent! Love Spiritual Sky oils!</li>
    <li> Makes you smell like an old school Hippie!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it smells like PineSol. I bought the Nag Champa one and it smells like it should, but this one isn&#x27;t quite right.</li>
    <li> Everywhere I go I get compliments on the scent this gives off. Most people know you&#x27;re wearing Patchouly because of it&#x27;s strong earthly scent. And you don&#x27;t have to use much at all, just the dab on your finger does it. Thank you Amazon for so many great products.</li>
    <li> It was a good smell incredibly earthy, but the amount was so small I just dumped the whole thing into a fragrant free conditioner I had so it smells good, the pachouli shampoo is over priced so I made my own.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it ♥ Scent is something you put on and forget about it, ... it leaves a nice wafting smell when You least expect it...nice smell ♥ yuumy even ♥ Smooth ♥</li>
    <li> Whenever I am wanting to patchouly, Spiritual Sky is the ONLY WAY I go.  Plus I like the emblem on the front I feel very hippy but in a clean way.</li>
    <li> I would give it Zero Stars if I could.  Shame on the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely no lasting or prominent scent.  I used This brand years ago and it is not the same now,  Very disappointed.  Bad product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting....thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome patchouly oil.  Smells just like the stuff we used in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> good stuff,not to strong like some others</li>
    <li> it is not the original patchouli scent  cant use it  want to return it</li>
    <li> Spiritual Sky patchouly is great I&#x27;ve worn it since I was in college. It lasts a long time and it has that heady smell that I like. I&#x27;ve experimented with a few other smells but nothing can compare to the aroma of spiritual sky. Over the years I&#x27;ve come to feel that it was my signature smell.</li>
    <li> I love the earthy aroma of this perfume. I was really bummed when the record shop that carried this perfume for the price of $3.00 closed down. My choices are to drive an hour into the city where another record store is or order it for a higher price off amazon.  I guess that&#x27;s just the way life goes.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell in the 70&#x27;s, still do today.  Bought a couple of bottles for my wife but she really wasn&#x27;t enjoying it so I started wearing it because the fragrance has so many great memories and its just wonderful.  Have had several people ask me what it was cause they love the smell.  Get some smiles when the memories hit.... Was wearing it a few weeks ago at a family gathering and my younger brother said I really like that earthy scent what is it?  Same genes.....;  Works for some others not so much.  Like alot of scents out there I am put off by others too.  So its what you like and Spiritual Sky at least for my needs is great.  To those that wear and enjoy hope I stroll by someday as the young ladies I remember wearing it were a great deal of fun imagine most still are.  Life goes on enjoy!</li>
    <li> I bought a second one for my daughter, who loves the smell too! It stays with me all day and sometimes the next day to. Sometimes I put a blouse on and can smell the patchouly! It is lovely, sexy, comforting and I get many compliments from it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;Paula</li>
    <li> I bought this product a long time ago too. It was cheaper then. But I couldn&#x27;t find it. Thanks to you people I&#x27;m happily smelling like Patchouly. Thank you once again. donlwagnerjr@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I have never smelled the original Spiritual Sky but it smells pretty good! Has a woody, moist, earthy , sweet with some sour smell. Not exactly like pure patchouli but smells pretty good.Just an FYI in case you didn&#x27;t know like other fragrances if your applying to skin the scent is different from just smelling it from the bottle. So give it try and wear it for awhile and see if it grows on you before you toss it out. The bottle might be smaller then expected but that ok because 2 or 3  drops for me last a good majority of the day. The scent does die out after a couple of hours but can still be smelled within a closer distance. I got my moneys worth out of this product.</li>
    <li> whenever i use this perfume i feel so fresh and it smells so good and the scent stays all day!</li>
    <li> GREAT SMELL WILL BUY AGAIN NEXT YEAR</li>
    <li> Great fragrance but its longentivity comes up short. Definitly a fragrance of choice</li>
    <li> Very happy with fragence. Had something similar many years ago and looked everywhere to replace it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is not the same...I still had an older bottle...and the older bottle is a much thicker oil that lasts for a few days.  This new product is clearly not the same...the smell is weaker and the fragrance does not last.  Very disappointed here.  P.S.  The older bottle was so good, it lasted me for 6 years (a little dab would do ya).  This new stuff you have to pour on. :(</li>
    <li> It came on time and my aunt loves it thank you</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  Arrived on time and was as expected.  I get compliments on it all the time.  People never know what it is exactly, but, like it anyway.  It&#x27;s an inexpensive alternative to the BRAND name fragrances that often smell just like the others.  Money well spent.</li>
    <li> I used to love Spiritual Sky products and was terribly disappointed in my recent purchase of the pachouli (and sandlewood) oils. Whatever this is..it is not pachouli..and it is unpleasant. The sandlewood  had almost no fragrance at all, and what little it did have was not sandlewood. Save your money people. This is not the same company it was years ago. I still have a small vial I purchased over 18 years ago and the few drops it still has remaining, is still rich and pungent. Very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> great product..been around for as long as I remember..great price..fast delivery. i would recommend this to anyone who loves scented oils</li>
    <li> Didnt think they made this still!! smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Patchouli, as I remember from the 60&#x27;s growing up in Pennsylvania, has rich &amp;#34;notes&amp;#34; of floral and wood.&lt;br /&gt;This is close, but something is missing, the Richness, of the two components.</li>
    <li> Every oil I get from Spiritiual Sky is just amazing. I think I won&#x27;t have to shop around anywhere else. Great price too!</li>
    <li> This perfume was bought for friend of mines (Daryl Braddix... Dancer(Katheryn Dunham), Congo Drum Player, &amp; Fitness Instructor) he&#x27;s using it as a car freshener and he loves it. Thanks for helping me make a good friend happy. I look forward to doing more business with this seller.</li>
    <li> like this oil smells like I was still in the 70</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as it did when I bought it as a teenager.</li>
    <li> perfect delivery time, excellent package, fragance does not last in the skin. I&#x27;m using it as an oil diffuser .</li>
    <li> Good aroma, but the formula for \\&quot;Spiritual Sky\\&quot; has changed over the years and isn&#x27;t quite as lingering and aromatic as before.  A good overall patchouli though.  I mix it with body lotion in lieu of aftershave, and get very positive compliments.  Masculine and exotic, and great for daily use.</li>
    <li> Good smell! But the bottle too small for the price plus shipping not worth it</li>
    <li> This smelled exactly like I think Patchouli should. It was a gift and he loved it too. I will order more in the future.</li>
