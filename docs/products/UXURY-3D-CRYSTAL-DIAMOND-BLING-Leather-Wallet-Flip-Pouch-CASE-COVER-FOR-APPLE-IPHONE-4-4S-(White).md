<li> The clamp to close ot fell off the first day, and its so hard to take off the case.</li>
<li> Worth what I paid but not good quality.</li>
<li> It was very cheaply made, the minimal wallet storage given was paper thin and the sections weren&#x27;t even sealed divider&#x27;s, what I mean is that it was two pockets that actually fell into one.</li>
<li> It lasts a long time and holds up to three cards!</li>
<li> Not worth the cost of shipping it back.</li>
<li> Falls out because it is loose.</li>
<li> This phone case\wallet was a huge disappointment .</li>
<li> the few minutes I had it laying out my eyes starting watering from the stench.&lt;br /&gt;Yuck!!!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have any regrets buying this case.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t close properly because the side is too small</li>
<li> Strap broke off within a week, which made it fall off my wrist and half the stones fell out, the magnet fell out so the flap does not stay shut.</li>
<li> but it ruins and wears out WAY too quick :(</li>
<li> The phone case is too small...</li>
<li> It is also to small that if you put something in the credit card side it doesn&#x27;t close.</li>
<li> Have had at least 3 friends say they want one too.</li>
<li> they made it so difficult</li>
<li> I&#x27;m so mad because the materials stitching is already coming off</li>
<li> Bad quality.</li>
<li> It smelled so bad almost toxic.</li>
<li> No the worst case I ever got broken</li>
<li> This is a horrible product.</li>
<li> This is a terrible case..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any regrets buying this case. Looks very elegant when going out.</li>
    <li> The day after i got it the thread already started to fray. Also the gold case on the inside broke too. Overall this is a pretty crappy item.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the attachment with the phone case</li>
    <li> Looks the same as the picture but made out of real cheap material that can easily rip apart, but it looks nice on the outside</li>
    <li> Most prettiest wallet case I have ever brought! It lasts a long time and holds up to three cards!</li>
    <li> This is a horrible product. Took 5 weeks to get. I put it in the garbage after opening. It smelled so bad almost toxic. My co-workers said to get rid of it a.s.a.p  Order at your own risk but the few minutes I had it laying out my eyes starting watering from the stench.&lt;br /&gt;Yuck!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t close properly because the side is too small and I&#x27;ve only had it for about two weeks and it&#x27;s already falling apart.</li>
    <li> I love it. There is one dislike which is I can&#x27;t insert a card in on the wallet side.  If I do the case want close. I love the case and do regret buying it at all.</li>
    <li> This is an inferior product...The phone case is too small...The card side can not hold cards as the case will not close if a car is in the slot...Even a business card is too much...</li>
    <li> it fell aprt as early as 2 months</li>
    <li> I love how the cased look in the picture, when i received it was pretty. I only had two problems with it.. The clamp to close ot fell off the first day, and its so hard to take off the case. Since you will need to if you want to use the flash on your camera</li>
    <li> Broke in two days. Bad quality. If you don&#x27;t want it to start coming apart like the actual phone case from the wallet or the white outside part changing colors whatever you rub it up against (like your pocket in your jeans) then do not purchase this item.</li>
    <li> Sure it had a chemicals odor upon delivery but it is super cute. I could barely hold 2 cards but love the feminine look yet not too flashy. I am content with my pick</li>
    <li> My cord snapped off within the first week of using it.&lt;br /&gt;the plastic coating over it peels off very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;its just really really cheap.</li>
    <li> This was a great product in the beginning. It definitely served it&#x27;s purpose but the quality of this product appear very cheap after a few weeks of use. It began to change colors and it also began to peel.</li>
    <li> I will definitely recommend y&#x27;all to but this item because it was exactly whys I was looking for in phone case which is wallet</li>
    <li> Case looks pretty but feels cheap.  The slots for the car credit cards feels like it&#x27;s about to rip w one card.</li>
    <li> No the worst case I ever got broken already you can&#x27;t even put ah card and money inside the case at the same time !</li>
    <li> I order the case for iPhone 4s but they sent the one for iPhone 5. I contacted them about it and they were very polite. They allowed me to keep the case and also refunded me the money for it within a timely manner. But the case, though it looks a little cheap, it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
    <li> Not as sturdy as i thought but my daughter likes it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this case . It looks amazing on my phone</li>
    <li> Did not get to enjoy it for a long period of time. But from a first  I love it</li>
    <li> It is the second out of 6 cases that have cracked and can&#x27;t use them</li>
    <li> I love my new case.  It meets my expectations.  The color is beautiful and all my friends like it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> It was alright in the beginning but after three weeks it began to tear apart.</li>
    <li> This is a terrible case.. It only worked for 4 hours and and then it fell apart. I only put my license and my debit card in it and it started calling apart at the seams. Do not waste your money. I&#x27;m warning you.</li>

    <li> This phone case\wallet was a huge disappointment . It was very cheaply made, the minimal wallet storage given was paper thin and the sections weren&#x27;t even sealed divider&#x27;s, what I mean is that it was two pockets that actually fell into one. I would never purchase from here again. Not worth the cost of shipping it back.</li>
