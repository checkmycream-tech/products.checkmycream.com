    <li> A little small but it worked</li>
    <li> Perfect size and soft material. Hasnt fallen apart yet.</li>
    <li> I used them as stocking stuffers, everyone like them.</li>
    <li> The size is nice, and it is relatively firm.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s intended to do. Cheap and useful. It does fall apart (as in it unravels) several months in, but that&#x27;s fine because it acts as a reminder for me to replace it</li>
    <li> Not as big as I expected, but not as small as some I&#x27;ve gotten.  So far they are holding up well.  Will be a good travel pouf instead of the tiny ones I&#x27;ve taken on my other trips.</li>
    <li> Not very large or soft. So so. Could have purchased the same at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> Great loufahs! After a few months I just threw out my first one! It frayed a little quickly and then it just stayed that way for months. Very happy with the durability for the price.</li>

    <li> Tiny not worth it to me.</li>

    <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
