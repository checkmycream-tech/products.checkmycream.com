<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> fast delivery and does the job!</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail dryer because I got tired of  waiting for my nails to try. I stick my nails in there for about 10 min and they are fairly dry. I&#x27;ve gotten better results using a fast dry nail enamel. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to do gel nails at home. I can&#x27;t justify spending money on salon nails right now. It has worked well</li>
    <li> Bulb not working on arrival.</li>
    <li> very helpful and small.</li>
    <li> This is the best 30.00 I ever spent! It arrived in great condition and fairly quick considering I ordered near a National Holiday! I am very happy with the light and it cures exactly how one would expect any salon quality light to cure.  I am not able to fit my thumb in the light but I was expecting that, and they do not claim that you can. I am able to fit my foot comfortably in the light though.  That was a plus as well.  I would rec this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to go all out but wants to try or do Gel polishing at home!  You will be happy with this purchase!!</li>
    <li> Easy hand access if you have any hand problems</li>
    <li> Works great.  Especially for touchups.</li>
    <li> Did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. Doesn&#x27;t work like the ones in the salon.</li>
    <li> awesome light. dries nails fast.. very great price and fast shipping. i do gel and acrylic nails and it dries them and sets them up. It also dries just regular nail polish as well. Makes doing you nails at home fun and easy. no more worrying about messing your nails up after you do them because with this like you nails will dry. The light came in one piece got the package opened it up and opened the light and plugged it in with no problem and turned it on and it worked:) I have not had a problem with it at all and i do nails at least 4x a week:) Very fast shipping in 2 days with amazon prime i am very happy with the shipping..the PRODUCT..as well as the results of each set of nails i do and use this light:) Im very happy and excited for more uses and i would recommend this to others:)</li>
    <li> Nails never dried no matter how long I kept them under light.</li>
    <li> It was a wonderful gift that arrived right on time.</li>
    <li> This works really well.</li>
    <li> got the uv lamp for gelt nails. I did buy the opi gel polish so I do not know if that has anything yo do with it.  Couldn&#x27;t grey the nails to dry even after 30 minutes in the lamp. Sending it back.</li>
    <li> This is very nice. Works great.</li>
    <li> I bought two and one was not working, the other one didn&#x27;t even got hot. I did the gel polish on my mom&#x27;s nails and they didn&#x27;t even dry. Would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Takes too long to dry, did everything recommend. Not worth the money or the time. if I wanted an hour of frustration, and several attempts at manicures,  I&#x27;d let my kids do it. I&#x27;m going to channel my money towards the nail salon from here forward, it&#x27;s much more relaxing, a bit more money, but way better than this.</li>
    <li> This is good for a starter, but an LED lamp is much faster and cures harder.</li>
    <li> Takes forever for nails to dry. Doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
    <li> Used 3 times and now the bulb won&#x27;t stay on. The connection seems loose. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> It works just like the shop</li>
    <li> Great services and product was as described.</li>
    <li> I received this lamp in a damaged box. The lamp was wrapped in bubble wrap with all the bubbles already popped and the bulb inside was loose (not plugged in) and broken. I just had to order replacement bulbs and I haven&#x27;t used it once. It looks like a very nice unit and hopefully once I can plug it in and use it, it will be fine. I just think any vendor should know that glass items need to be carefully packed and not left to bounce around loose inside a package.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my needs and at an unbeatable price. I have recommended this product to multiple people.</li>
    <li> ok but takea to long to set cause its only one lamp at 9 w</li>
    <li> This is a great product...and the only way to get the &amp;#34;greatness&amp;#34; out of a product is to well...use it correctly (: This is a UV lamp intended for GEL nail polish. I have been doing my own gel manicures for the past year and I currently usually only use products from the brand gelish. Please take in mind that if you&#x27;ve never done your own gel manicure at home, this lamp is not magical. You must follow the proper steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply a PH bond to your nails (I then put my hand under the lamp for about 30 seconds.)&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply gel foundation (put hand under for 90 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply 2-3 coats of preferred gel polish color of choice (your hand must go under the lamp for 90 seconds between each coat!) Please remember to set your hands between every coat, this is very important.&lt;br /&gt;4.Apply your gel top coat (put hand under lamp for final 90 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;5. Wipe the tops of your nails with nail cleanser or sterile alcohol wipes to remove tackiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest getting a good gel starter kit. Gel polish will not work properly without applying a foundation and top coat. Also if you&#x27;ve never done gel polish before, your nails will be very sticky after the top coat is complete. That&#x27;s why you will need to wipe your nails with cleanser or alcohol. Gel does not dry like normal polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lamp itself is smaller than other ones I&#x27;ve used before, and the one thing I highly dislike about the lamp is there is no automatic timer. You must manually turn it on and off. Which can be a pain to try and estimate 90 seconds haha. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great! Also despite other reviews I&#x27;ve read, you can fit your entire hand inside.</li>
    <li> It was a xmas present for my sister&lt;br /&gt;Got heree on time&lt;br /&gt;Dries your nail asap&lt;br /&gt;My sister loves it</li>
    <li> I have not tired it yet cause I have to order the some other kits, so when I do I would like to give the rating again on this product.</li>
    <li> Sent mine back&lt;br /&gt;After 20 minutes my nail were still wet</li>
    <li> got this for my mom, at first she thought it didnt work but you just have to push the light bulb back into place, works like a charm!</li>
    <li> The seller provided wonderful service and delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I responded to my wife&#x27;s mention of needing a finger nail polish dryer.  Unfortunately, being a male I was not aware there are varieties of nail polish.  This machine was for &amp;#34;jel&amp;#34; nail polish.  My lady does not use &amp;#34;jel&amp;#34; polish.  The listing blatently stated for &amp;#34;jel&amp;#34; polish.  My mistake.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I used the bmc nail gel with this lamp. Fingers came out awesome! Easy to use! I just used the timer on my phone to cure the nails. Can&#x27;t wait to use other colors! Money well spent!</li>
    <li> I just got the unit a few days ago and this is my first time using it and it doesn&#x27;t work. I plugged it up, turned it on and nothing happened. Pretty bummed because now I have to go through the trouble of sending it back and purchasing a new one.</li>
    <li> It puts out a good amount of uv for the nails. i give it 4 stars because it don&#x27;t stop on its own. I have to keep time and cut it off myself. Wish it was a litter bigger but nice for the price.</li>
    <li> Be aware this product does NOT work for Gel nail polish, does not harden. Disappointed, thought I found a good deal.</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME Nail Dryer! Now I can start doing my own shellac manicures at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dries the polish very quickly. You can also use it for drying your toenails. I LOVE this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love the gel manicures because they last so long but they are a little more expensive so you can&#x27;t exactly do them every week. But now, I bought this nail dryer, I can do the nail Salon at home or take it by travel. It’s really amazing! It just has only a little problem, just need a little long time to dry it, but for the beautiful nails, I don’t care!!!</li>
    <li> I used this lamp twice before it stopped working completely. Even with a changed bulb. No wonder it is so cheap.</li>
    <li> As always with things I order from amazon it came sooner than they estimated. I have large hands and I can fit my thumb in with my fingers. Some lights are not large enough and you have to do thumbs separate. I only have to put my gelish polishes for one minute at a time. This is a great product and great quality for the money!</li>
    <li> great value and excellent for curing gel polish</li>
    <li> I cured each coat of Gelish (base coat, three colored coats [Midnight caller needs three very thin coats]) for 2 minutes, and then the final top coat for 3 minutes. There is more than enough room to cure one hand at a time (thumb included), so a manicure takes 20 minutes tops. And for a completely worry-free manicure after it&#x27;s cured that lasts for 2 weeks, that&#x27;s worth 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother buying a more expensive lamp just to cure your gel polish manicure. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but it&#x27;ll save me $45 every two weeks.</li>
    <li> I received this item only to find out it didn&#x27;t work.  I plugged it in, hit the switch, and got nothing. I returned it for full credit and went with a fan style dryer.  I would not recommend this product. This was the first time i received a bad item from amazon. I usually have a good experience.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and delivered earlier then expected!!</li>
    <li> Just got it and it is not working! I needed to get my nails done for a function but I was disapointed!</li>
    <li> for $10 more buy a 36v lamp! this product sucks! complete waste of time and money. the seller was great, but the drier didnt work. purchased a 36v one and have amazing results in 1/2 the time of the other one</li>
    <li> works great,just like it says it does,no real complaints,but haven&#x27;t had to change the bulb yet,i can already see that is going to be a chore!</li>
    <li> Does not do as much as I thought but will use it for now I have to order another one with more power!~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this with IBD gel nails and the lamp works great. Each gel product used with the lamp cured just fine including the gel top coat. It&#x27;s a little small but it works with no problems. Perfect for a beginner.</li>
    <li> It does not work for shellac</li>
    <li> works well but does not shut off so you have to keep track of time</li>
    <li> This works well for doing gel nails, I wish I had done more research, I might have gotten an LED light instead because it takes less time with an LED light.  I do wonder whether the UV light will be more effective though.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> The light bulb was broken so I don&#x27;t even know if this thing works. I will order and replace the bulb because I feel it good quality.</li>
    <li> Not really what I wanted. Not enough wattage to get the the job done. I want to send it back.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Highly Recommended seller.</li>
    <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t broken. It&#x27;s the perfect size. I&#x27;m going to be returning it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was not packaged well at all.</li>
    <li> I did not like what I got it did not work and what I mean it did not work I mean it was open and broken WHEN I GOT IT</li>
    <li> This is a great lamp for the price.  When using Gels just follow the directions.  Let dry for 2 mins. per step and 3 mins at the end (top coat).  Your nails WILL be tacky, just wipe your nails with the peroxide 99 or 90,  and your nails will be ready to go.</li>
    <li> If you get a working one this product might be ok, but the one I received would not turn on.</li>
    <li> This lamp has serious electrical issues which need to be address. The power cord connection on my unit is defective as I have to jiggle the cord in order for it to work. This could lead to several serious problems. The seller should contact the lamp manufacture  and make him aware of this issue before someone receive an electrical shock or injury.</li>
    <li> Significantly cheaper than other models out there and I have had good success with it. ISo far so good, I guess.</li>
    <li> Love my nail dryer! Used it as soon as I opened it (any excuse for a mani!) Salon quality for a reasonable price. Fast shipping and wonderful service. A+</li>
    <li> When I first received this package, it arrived with a broke UV light, but I left feedback and I was contacted immediately and was given a brand new UV light plus an extra one for the inconvenience, with that being said, I highly recommend that you get this product because you will be satisfied with the order and the customer service.</li>
    <li> This lamp is a very nice size and at a great price. The bulb should be wrapped or packaged though. It is placed inside the lamp loose where it can be easily broken. I recommend the lamp to anyone needing one and isnt able to spend a lot. This one is perfect</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry gel polish.</li>
    <li> I love that and nail dry quick and turn out pretty to</li>
    <li> This little lamp was just what I needed for my small projects using the sunlight curing epoxy. It arrived just as I expected and I was delight with how it worked. Would recommend to other buyers</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy much online, but I needed this lamp and didn&#x27;t feel like spending 50 bucks at walmart or walgreens. I just used it, I used 2 coats of sensational polish, primer and base (which all state on the bottle to use with LED lamp). I used sally hansen top coat to finish. I cured under this UV light for 2-3 mins each coat- with my whole hand in there (and I have a normal size hand). They are DRY, shiny and gorgeous! People who say this doesn&#x27;t work; I&#x27;m very confused by their posts-they are doing something wrong? This product does work. It came packaged fine and arrived quickly. Thanks MelodySusie!!</li>
    <li> I bought 1 of this product as gift and it was just what I wanted. The price was really cheap. My friend told me that this dryer was easy to use and has good quality. She loved this nail dryer. The user manual also tells her how to use it and it is really easy to follow. My freind was very pleased with this product! Recommend it！</li>
    <li> I purchased this M.S nail dryer a few month ago,the reason I didn&#x27;t leave review before is that I want to try more days to check the quality.Until now,this nail dryer still works great! I have purchased other brand nail dryer and unfortunately it stop working after half month.BTW,I also like the nail nipper seller send to me.Overall,it&#x27;s worthy!</li>
    <li> Its easy to use and takes hardly any time at all for nails to dry. The bulb was loose when I got it but was fairly easy to put back in.</li>
    <li> I like it. Im not into UV gels just yet but when I do I will be ready. I use it with my other brands. It seems to help some. Cute and compact. Very Nice</li>
    <li> This works great for at home shellac nails. I used it for 4 minutes after the base coat, color coat and top coat. My nails were still sticky afterwards, but I put rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball and rubbed each nail. After this they turned out perfect! The only problem was that when I received my package, the UV bulb was shattered. This was not a problem though. I contacted the customer service via email and they were very nice and helped me get a new bulb at no cost. Overall this is a great company and a great item!</li>
    <li> Product came to me with a broken lightbulb and still does not dry nails. Not a good sale at all.</li>
    <li> Its great just theres no timer and the outlet tends to shut off my tv whenever i turn it on or off kinda scary but works well</li>
    <li> very cheap and not worth a penny!!!!!!</li>
    <li> When I recieved my product in the mail the UV light was broken, so I thought I would just order a new bulb for it and everything would be fine. I finally got the replacement bulbs in the mail, followed the instructions that came with the dryer on how to replace the light bulb; was very easy to follow. Went to go plug it in and then turned it on and it did not work.</li>
    <li> I love this lamp. It does it&#x27;s job so well and sets my gel nails (Gelish) within 2 minutes. The downfall is that if you use 5 fingers at once, either the thumb or pinky will have a pushed and uneven layer because of the UV rays push onto the nails. I&#x27;d recommend using 4 finger on both hands and thumbs separate to get an even layer. Overall, this lamp does it job excellent in setting my gel nails and can be used for regular nail polish (it would take a bit longer to set, but it&#x27;s do-able).</li>
    <li> I purchased two of this acrylic nail driers, waited for the long arrival and finally they came! One drier worked perfectly, but the second drier which was a gift for a young teen didn&#x27;t even light up?! I ended buying my friend something else! Better luck next time!</li>
    <li> used it for the first time today. 10 seconds into use and it was smoking. the machine not my nails thankfully. will return this asap before it burns my home down!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i bought this item for a friend of mine as a surprise she loved it! works great and i get my nails done all the time.</li>
    <li> Excellent love it a must have works great just like the salons but cheaper I would buy again if need be.</li>
    <li> I used it with &amp;#34;IBD gel polish- LED/UV&amp;#34;. I spent half an hour with my hand in it and it was still sticky- it didnt work. Then I applied a top coat of Gelish on my nails and it finally worked...some. Nails finally dried, but they chipped next day, so they weren&#x27;t properly cured.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying the product is bad, it just didn&#x27;t work with the IBD gel.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure this particular lamp works with your favorite gel polish, they do mention some brands in the product description that are not compatible with it.</li>
    <li> great price even though i cannot compare to other uv lamps but this product has done its job perfectly. have it since christmas and use it at least once a week. it does not have a timer so i just use my phone to set the minutes. only fits one hand at a time. i use it for Shellac and it works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done two manicures (shellac) and one pedicure and already paid for all of the products I needed to get started twice over.</li>
    <li> All my other things to do my own gel manicure arrived - I was so excited to finally do this for myself. I opened up the box to set up the nail dryer and BAM - totally not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item not well packaged inside the original box. Light bulb was just &#x27;loose&#x27; inside the unit - not even in bubble pack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for on this one. Returning it, obviously. I don&#x27;t plan to reorder it. I&#x27;ll pay a little more for another unit that comes with extra bulbs - so I know it has to be packed properly.</li>
    <li> Works Fantastic!!! Works with different brands of gel polish, it is small and easy to store.  Only downfall is it doesn&#x27;t have a timer on it, but that&#x27;s no big deal</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying $25 for gel Mani so I purchase this, along with some gel colors, and now I can say I&#x27;m close to becoming a pro</li>
    <li> This machine was simple and easy to use. It is also small, portable and can store away in a second. My nails cured quickly and look great!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK. quickly  but the gel polish falls off in sheets. Not sure if it&#x27;s the polish or the dryer.</li>
    <li> With this particular product it would take my nails longer to dry.  I do not feel any air blowing and a little of heat coming from the UV light. I am not sure what it is supposed to do...either blow cool air or heat.  I would recommend others to not purchase this item.</li>
    <li> So far so good I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but it delivered as promised. Salon quality nail dryer and it cut the drying time in half.</li>
    <li> This does not cure gel nails.  No matter how long you leave your nails there.  Directions for my polish say you only need to leave it under the lamp for 30 seconds.  I did several increments of 30 seconds and also several 1 minute increments.  Still did not cure the gel.  Nails eventually dried overnight and then just came off the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product!  Disappointing.  And now the gel polish is wasted.  And gel polish is EXPENSIVE.  I wish I could also ask them to reimburse me the $12.99+ I spent!</li>
    <li> Is good this product thanks i like to much.</li>
    <li> Poor job. Doesn&#x27;t work for CND Shellac base coat. Put my nails in for about 10 minutes and it doesn&#x27;t dry. Light bulb takes some time to start up and is cheaply made.. DO NOT PURCHASE. A waste of your money.</li>
    <li> It work perfect !!! And for the price it is excellent. I used it for gel lacquer and its fast</li>
    <li> Not completely satisfied with product. Will be returning it.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work AT ALL. Kept my nails under for several minutes and they were still tacky.  I put them back under and timed myself for another 5 minutes and they were still not cured. Spent more money on polish that I won&#x27;t get to use until I spend more money buying a better quality light.</li>
    <li> This is my first time ordering a nail dryer I love it only thing I wish it had a timer to let you know when nails are dry but it still excellent product love love it.thank you ..</li>
    <li> Did a good job. For its size</li>
    <li> great for thee gel nails</li>
    <li> Stopped working after only 2 weeks. I suppose you get what you pay for with this.</li>
    <li> It worked for me. Not expensive at all and does the job. Plus shipping was very quick.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as professional nail dryer as the product claims to.</li>
    <li> I love it when I can paint my nails and have them last more than a couple of hours un-chipped.  However, the only way I could get that was with nail salons.  (I&#x27;m a teacher and cannot afford the biweekly trips like my sister.)  Not even using a quick dry spray helped, until now.  I used my nail dryer for the first time last night.  I used a based coat, nail color, top coat, quick dry spray, and this nail dryer.  I have not had a problem with chipped paint.  This is the longest I&#x27;ve had at home painted nails that lasted past the morning un-chipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention the costumer service.  When first my nail dryer arrived it was broken.  The bulb had broken en-route and left damage inside the dryer.  (I assume it was due to the poor packaging job.)  I got in contact with MelodySusie and received a response right away.  They asked for pictures of the damage.  (I sent photos of the inside of the lamp as well as how I had received the item.)  Within a couple of days they had replied and sent me a new dryer.  (The packaging was much better the second time.)  I&#x27;m very pleased with their customer service.</li>
    <li> The first time out of the box, it didn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> **Do not buy this** it doesn&#x27;t work it all. I don&#x27;t recommend this product you will throw away your money.</li>
    <li> Cheap and easy to usse love</li>
    <li> The lamp is easy to use and such a grwat investment for do it yourself shellac nails.</li>
    <li> This is listed as an LED UV lamp but it is not. It is a florescent UV AND While the wattage is listed as 9W, it takes 2 to 3 minutes to cure where a proper LED lamp will take 45s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works, but is not as described. Look for another type that is LED for your GEL UV cured polish.</li>
    <li> This lamp is great for the price. I wish it was a little deeper but I have done my fingers and toes and it works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this this for at least 5 months now and it works great.  Next time I think I would spend the extra cash and get an LED dryer just because they are much faster.  Also I can&#x27;t fit my whole hand in here so I have to paint my thumbs separately.  Kind of a bummer and time consuming..</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, good package, very light, good product.</li>
    <li> Good but no directions</li>
    <li> didnt work well with gel polish bought in stores</li>
    <li> I like the nail dryer but I broke the bulb so now I can&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> The wife said she loves this thing,  my only concern is the reports I have read about skin cancer since it is like a tanning bed</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail and i can say that am very satisfied about it. Its a pretty good size and i love it!!!</li>
    <li> When this item arrived the bulb was shattered, then it took more than 3 weeks to receive the replacement bulb.  When I attempted to use this product it didn&#x27;t work, I sat with my hand under the lamp for over an hour... Seriously, useless product.</li>
    <li> My Girlfriend would love this item Im excited to let her see it when she wokes up later and very fast shipping two thumbs</li>
    <li> Takes a while to cure.</li>
    <li> The main concern most people post is that it quits working early on. It turned off on me on the 2nd use. But then I pushed the light bulb in more and abra cadabra it turned on. The light comes uninstalled so all you have to do is push it in. It&#x27;s great  a great product. The light is super strong. My only issue is I feel like it doesn&#x27;t cure very quickly. Or maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong,  maybe too thick coats? I cure for 5 min. Seems like a lot to me and they are still sticky.... I have heard that uv takes longer than led but uv is the cheaper option.</li>
    <li> Lamp came with bulbs detached and rust around all metalic parts. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was better than I thought it would be. Love it.</li>
    <li> I received my package by fed ex about a week ago which I like that it came through there because most place like if its coming from the mail man you can&#x27;t track where your stuff has gone ...but anyway I used my light for the first time yesterday I like it but it takes a long time to cure gels reason being that when ur using gel polish and you want to use a uv light you need a light with 36 watts so it cures the polish. . now my polish did cure but it took atleat 10 minutes to  do just 1 hand ..I also went to beauty school so I do no what im doing ...but you do get what you paid for ...it dose cure it does work but you just have to be patient. ..</li>
    <li> When I unboxed the lamp the light bulb was detached and when I attached, plugged it in and turned it on it wouldn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use to get my nails done at a Solon and because of this item and my Belle® Pen Shape Electric Nail File (which I&#x27;ve also acquired from Amazon) i do my own nails, for free, as often as I want!!  Thank you! I&#x27;m very happy!!</li>
    <li> Its okay to use for drying my nails.</li>
    <li> Never worked...dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Great it&#x27;s just like a pro!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp to go with my Gelish brand gel nail kit. I am not a manicurist, and I will only need to use this light once every few weeks when redoing my mani/pedi,so I can&#x27;t advise on how well it would do with high volume daily uses. I did first mani/pedi using this light three days ago and worked like a charm. I followed the drying time that the polish recommended and that worked without any problems. I have had my gel polish on for 4 days 3 days now, through two nights of bartending at my part time and three days of typing at my full time job, and no chips or peels so far. I conclude that the light must have dried like it should have because when I&#x27;ve gotten my nails done at the salon, they never lasted through days of banging them on bottles, digging in the change drawer, spilling alcohol on them, washing them excessively, or typing as much as I do. Perhaps the Gelish brand had something to do with that too.&lt;br /&gt;There is no timer on the light so you have to manually time yourself and turn it off after each use. The opening is very wide and accomodated my hands and feet side by side (they are narrow though). The height of the opening is tall enough not to bump your nails while moving around. The lamp also came with a cuticle clipper, which was odd, but oh well, I needed one.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I bought this for my daughter and I to do our nails together as a fun mommy and daughter time. We were both able to get our nails dried quickly without having to wait more than 5 mins and without worry that our nails would smudged. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This came to me and unfortunately did not open it right away as I didn&#x27;t need it.  On first try out of the box it didn&#x27;t work.  Too late to return.</li>
    <li> My niece does my nails, I bought this for her. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this light. Does exactly what it suppossed to do.</li>
    <li> Does not cure gel polish..  Waste of money</li>
    <li> Brand new, out of box and won&#x27;t dry or cure my gelish polish. Won&#x27;t work for the foundation base coat, or the polish no matter how long they are left under the light. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, I had no problems at all</li>
    <li> Works great! My acrylic nails dried faster and harder with this and it helps cure my nail polish faster too. I love it. Great price! I only wish it was a little smaller. It&#x27;s pretty bulky.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I asked for</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing nails for 9 years and this light works amazingly with my product. I bought 2 of them and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Very good quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Can save money by doing my own gel nails at home which is my goal . It works great! Love it..</li>
    <li> Very good, stays on doesn&#x27;t shut off which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Just used this a few times and already it does not properly, does not cure the nails.  Also did not receive the product I ordered, got a knockoff from China</li>
    <li> I always want to do something new with my nails and this product works perfectly for me. Now I can do it all by my self :)</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed the light did not cure my polish wish I could return it.  I used blue sky polish held my hand under the light for 1hour nothing.</li>
    <li> I use this lamp with Gelish products and works great! I wouldn&#x27;t spend more money on the Gelish brand lamp.</li>
    <li> Works well, great price. I found that my Gelish nails were chipping unless I gave each coat 3min and the final top coat 4min.</li>
    <li> Love shellaquing my own nails. Saves time (30 minutes tops) and lots of money! I shellac at home and can watch tv and not have to make small talk. Polish can last two weeks with minor touch ups.</li>
    <li> Nice light, works great, no complaints!</li>
    <li> Love this lamp quick dry my nail polish</li>
    <li> took longer to dry but great machine!</li>
    <li> Work great love it 5 star</li>
    <li> I use this UV lamp together with my roommates. We all agree this is a very good nail dryer. We paint nail polish for each other and dry nails with this professional machine. It is just like in salon. Nice experience! And we are also willing to buy one for home use. I highly recommend this lamp.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp on sale for $20, plus the [[ASIN:B005MG86TY CND Shellac Top and Base \\&quot;Set of 2\\&quot; Good Deal]] and a bottle of CND color shellac polish.  I don&#x27;t ever go to nail salons, but instead usually use regular nail polish color/top coat from the drug store, so believe me when I say I have zero experience with shellac!  I found instructions online (30 second cure for base, 2 minute cure for two coats color and one coat top).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are PERFECT.  It&#x27;s like MAGIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I never ever write reviews, and I had to tell you ladies.  Buy this lamp, and get amazing nails.  All in all, it cost me about $70 for all three bottles and the lamp, which is cheaper than 4 professional manicures!  (And, honestly, they look way better, because I am super particular.)</li>
    <li> Love it! Great price, great product. I&#x27;m a very happy customer. It is everything I was looking for and more.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t dry the gel nail polish as indicated. Directions are confusing because they read as if they were written in a foreign language and translated through a very bad translator. Asked for a refund and was not given any postage credit or information on where to send it.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, it dried my uv top coat in 5 min and my nails look glossy and sparkaly!&lt;br /&gt;I do my own acrylic nails and I used regular nail polish under Lina uv top coat , I only put one thin coat of the uv topcoat and it dried perfectly, I can tell its dry by tapping my nails and it sounds like plastic. The only thing that I did not like was when I turn it on the light flickers a couple of times n I&#x27;m scared it&#x27;s gonna go out lol but besides that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This was purchased with some help from the recipient, in that their regular nail tech uses exactly the same model.  She has been very pleased to have it at home where she can occasionally &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; her nails without giving up a lot of lost time waiting on them to dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on myself and friends/family to do shellac at home. I&#x27;ve used it at least 20X now and works great. Only thing is it&#x27;s not too powerful so I have to let each coat sit under the light for 3-4 mins instead of 40 secs like the more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> When I received the Lamp, the lightbulb was loosely floating inside the lamp without any sort of cushioning and was broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I purchased a new lightbulb I plugged it in and discovered the entire unit does not work. I&#x27;m hoping that the lamp will be replaced by the company without much difficulty. They really just need to learn to better package their products, and check for defective lamps.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews. I applied a thin layer of the CND Shellac UV base coat. I believe, my nails never dried completely. Then, 10-15 minutes per layer since they didn&#x27;t dry. Then, I applied the alcohol and got a very cheap look. Can anybody help me? I ended exhausted. My shellac products are expensive. I don&#x27;t think this machine is working. Susy Melody responds to the customers with the same automated response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my wife so that she could to do my UV gel nails at home few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought it, I was a little bit worried about the quality due to there were some poor comments on this product. But the price was very good, so I bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I received it very fast. When I opened the package, the bulb was a little bit loose. But it didn’t matter. I just pushed it in the sockets and it works. Once I got the bulb in there right, it worked amazing! My wife told me it&#x27;s very fast to dry her nails.&lt;br /&gt;So if you need a UV nail dryer, you can choose this one！&lt;br /&gt;Low price with great quality; moreover,the shipping was also extremely fast as well as professional customer service.&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes it very much.  She said she will go to the seller for the product if needed in future!</li>
    <li> They re really nice!!! I&#x27;m in love with it!!</li>
    <li> 3.5-4 rating the drying sped does depend on the thickness of the polish.</li>
    <li> Light bulb is a little loose, but it does work. Good deal for the price.</li>
    <li> I decided to write a review after using for several days because I would like to test how good or bad it would be so that I could write an objective reivew here for others who would like to buy. This nail dryer, actually is a bit small because I can&#x27;t dry my two hands at the same time. But after using it for the very first time, so far my nails still looks pretty beautiful. I&#x27;m very happy to have it. It&#x27;s a small design but really works great!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this lamp in order to have acrylic nails. At the beginning I was so happy to have it: decent size, fashionable, but after using it, I was very disappointed because it did not dry my nails properly. I had UV lamp lights before, but I have never had a bad one like this.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. it doesn&#x27;t set the gel nail polish at all. waste of time and money. even put nails under up to 10 minutes, still not set.</li>
    <li> I love this little UV laml. And YES it does work with Gelish polish. I first put on the gelish ph balance (dries out nails) then i put a thin layer of foundation and cure it for 4 mins then i spray my nails with rubbing alcohol and wipe with paper towels, then i use the color of my choice (regular polish usually works if you let it fully dry) then i put on the Gelish Top It Off and cure for another 5 minutes then wipe with rubbing alcohol with paper towels or any lint free wipes and you are good to go. There is no need to buy a super high power uv lamp for Gelish Polishes. Im writing this long review because i know it would have been helpful for me when i was looking to get into doing nails. Have a nice day</li>
    <li> it works great my first gel nails at home came out good! dryers nails completely!!!awesome nail home dryer......good good good</li>
    <li> Received item on time but the uv light was broken so I contacted MelodySusie and they sent a new uv light to me. Looking forward to doing my own polish and designs. Nail salons can get expensive. Will give review on nail dryer once I try it out. Don&#x27;t want to rate this just yet. For easy steps on how to use the nail dryer watch on u tube. It looks really easy.</li>
    <li> It works like it says it should. I just use a timer on my phone it works fine for me! I&#x27;m new at doing acrylics so it was exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> Ill start of by saying it was very well packaged. it came in a box inside another box with air bags to prevent bumping I was very impressed with that. it does flicker at the beginning when turned on but i think this is something that happens to most UV lights. It is small yet goes in far enough to where sour nails dont bump and also great for toes. I love how the cord is long, and let me add, i LOVED the fact that they put in a little &amp;#34;present&amp;#34; in it for me (cuticle clippers) i am very happy with the seller and would absolutely buy from them again. Shiping got here 2-3 weeks before. LOve it</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even work ... D.O.A ... Its been broke since it showed up on my door step ... Sucks ... I want a refund or send me new light bulbs ...</li>
    <li> I was really nervous when i first ordered this, it actually took me about 1 month to decide whether it was worth the risk.  All the CND shellacs say it HAS to be with their lamp or it doesn&#x27;t work but their lamps are almost 200$ and my god the shellac is expensive enough! This product states it is ONLY for CND brand shellac and I can say it is as advertised.  Its only 1 bulb so if you&#x27;re one of those UV worriers its the smallest lamp in that sense i&#x27;ve seen out there,  It&#x27;s super affordable and it actually works which is the best part!! I have not used it with gelish because it says not to I only use CND shellac.  I had some trouble with it setting the first time but after watching some shellac how to videos it was actually my error in application of the shellac not the lamp.  Lamp works wonderfully and I am so happy!!  Thank you melody susie for coming up with an affordable alternative the the CND lamp!</li>
    <li> No did notice this at all,,,don&#x27;t use because it does not dry your gel nails at all</li>
    <li> Received this product in the mail and was so excited to open it up to use.  When I plugged it in, it did not work.  I tried several times to adjust the bulb and tried several different outlets and it still did not work.  I was very disappointed in this product. :(</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really dried my Shellac nail polish.. I placed my finger for more than 4 minutes, but it was not dried at all</li>
    <li> The seller claims it is for \\&quot;All Brand (sic) UV Gel Nail Polish\\&quot;, but then makes excuses for why it doesn&#x27;t work with yours.    With this thing, you will get LESS than what you pay for. I didn&#x27;t mind sitting an extra few minutes to set the polish in order to save a few dollars, but HOURS is another matter entirely - especially when just the BASE COAT never really set. This complaint is common to the one-star reviews, and I wish I had paid more attention to them. Whether it&#x27;s the wattage or some other flaw, this product just does not work for its stated purpose, and I believe the seller knows this.    You should note that the seller has a habit of replying to those reviews with a canned (bad English) response designed to put the fault on the user. Though the tone is superficially helpful, they never address the specifics of an individual&#x27;s complaint, but offer their email address if you had any other questions. Desperate to try to salvage my evening and end up with some decent looking nails, I tried their \\&quot;suggestions\\&quot; to no avail, and decided to go straight to emailing them in the hopes that they would offer more specific help, or to negotiate a refund. I was disappointed to receive a slightly altered (with my name and the type of polish I used) but otherwise almost exactly the same response as the one-star reviews had received.  See below:    \\&quot;Thanks for your message. We are very sorry that the item didn&#x27;t make you satisfied.    We checked your order id and knew that you bought a 9W UV nail dryer from us. And it didn&#x27;t cure Gelish brand polish properly. Here we would like to provide you some suggestions of how to use this product properly.  Please kindly see the comments below:  1. Please kindly check the ingredient of the gel polish. This is UV light nail dryer, it can only cure the UV gel polish, it can&#x27;t dry or it will take a very long time to dry other improper gel polish, such as led gel polish. Please check the nail polish you bought and used are UV gel polish. This UV nail dryer can work with UV GEL Nail Polish such as following brand nail polish: CND Shellac Color Coat, CND Shellac Top Coat, CND Shellac Base Coat.  2.Please kindly know that the drying time is different from the light color to the dark color. The dark colors need longer time to dry. The drying time will also be different for the thin and thick polish layer. Please make sure to apply a thin layer for each time.  3.It is normal for gel polish to remain tacky until you wipe off the residue with cleaner. If you touch your nail against anything while it is tacky it will smudge or get little bits of fuzz on it, but it usually isn&#x27;t a problem. You can use the cleanse after curing each coat and then it won&#x27;t be sticky and will give you a smoother surface.    We sincerely hope that the message would be helpful for you. If you have any inquiry, please feel free to contact us. We will try our best to help you solve the problems.\\&quot;    I was irritated with this response for the following reasons:    * The fact that they did not acknowledge (or know) that Gelish is a top brand of UV gel nail polish. Why are they selling a UV light that  they plainly state is for \\&quot;All Brand (sic) of UV Gel Nail Polish\\&quot;, and then making excuses for why that&#x27;s not true?  * They did not acknowledge that I had specifically stated that I had followed their suggestions with the cleaner, and that it hadn&#x27;t resolved the issue.  * I had specifically stated that I never got the base coat to cure, so I did not appreciate all the extra canned \\&quot;light vs. dark\\&quot; polish \\&quot;suggestions\\&quot; that did not apply to me.  * They did not acknowledge my request for a refund (Amazon took care of me though).    So, for the first time in a very long time, I have left a very detailed bad review - and I hope it stops someone else from wasting their time. Off to purchase a higher wattage/higher quality lamp - because if it works right, I actually will save time and money in the long run.</li>
    <li> When I received it, I was very excited.  Anxiously waiting to use it. But it does not work. When I received it, didn&#x27;t work. I have tried pressing the button in the back to make it come on, but it doesn&#x27;t.  Money wasted!  :(  Would like to know where can I take it to repair it. I have always shopped AMAZON and have been well pleased. But not with this item.</li>
    <li> Junk, brand new out of the package, and didn&#x27;t work. After a struggle to finally get help to try to replace, was told I also had to pay all shipping costs. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer did not dry my nails at all.  Also, the design of this product only allows for four fingers to be dried (if it did actually dry) at a time.  To top it off, I tried returning this product with in the 30 days and the return was denied.</li>
    <li> LOVE this UV nail dryer - it is perfect for at-home gel manis :)  It is a very sturdy piece and love the fact that the inside is reflective and also large enough (for me, anyways) to fit all 5 fingers in at once!  Love that it is electric and not battery operated.  All-in-all this is a major bargain for your dollar!  My previous lamp was not this good of quality and I paid 3x as much!  Also received an unexpected bonus: a free scissor cuticle trimmer!  Always wanted one of those :)  Definitely, definitely get this lamp.</li>
    <li> I have never used one of these before, but it seems to work.  My gel nails do not last 2 weeks.  They chip like regular polish.</li>
    <li> Excellent for one hand at a time, but any more than that, and the customer usually smudges the nail, from trying to crowd them in all all once.</li>
    <li> Very nice, I like it, it do great job, I will recommend it to anyone of interest. Thank you for your speedy deliver</li>
    <li> It works great! I do 3 minutes for each cure to be safe, and it is flawless! I use gelish soak off polish as well.</li>
    <li> Not for shellac nails. I tried this then read the recommendationu  that the uv for shellac is 34w uv. My undercoat would not dry and bubble terribly, had to use the accetone to get it off.</li>
    <li> Everything works as expected, it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of wattage though because it&#x27;s so small, and also white is not my favorite color. If you can sell other colors like yellow or pink. I could buy two more for gift.</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail and it was broken. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this product. -_-</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work!!! my nails never fully &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; with this. I used many different types of paint and nothing ever worked :(</li>
    <li> I got mine in the mail yesterday, and have done my nails and toes already. It is so worth the money and beats going to the nail salon and paying the high prices. It is a smaller lamp but bigger than expected, from the way the picture looked. I use it with the Gelish kit that I ordered at the same time. This is the perfect lamp for beginners and I highly recommend it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> its poor quality I turn it on and it didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> We were so excited to get this for our daughter&#x27;s birthday.  However when we opened it the UV lamp bulb was shattered and there was glass everywhere.  I would think that it would have shipped with the bulb protected.  It was not.  There was no protection.  I would assume that this would and does happen a lot.  You maybe taking a risk when buying it, that the lamp will not be shattered.  I can not review the product on how well it worked as it never worked for us.</li>
    <li> Awesome. It works great. Perfect size. Fabulous price. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> as described. Great value</li>
    <li> Bought one and I love it. Bought this one and came broke.still waiting for return and has been a few wks.</li>
    <li> Timely sale, great deal for the price</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheap lamp that would work well for personal use and this one is exactly that. Plus it comes with a nail nipper, a very useful gift. I have used this nail dryer for over 2 months now and everything works well just like when I first got it.</li>
    <li> My dryer nail work immediately.  Very sleek and stylish.  I put it to work immediately.  I dried my hands like a professional nail salon.  I recommend  this product.</li>
    <li> This works great for home personal use and I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist. It&#x27;s a little narrow so it&#x27;s not good for use with new customers that could easily bump fingers or toes.</li>
    <li> Works great for doing my gel nail polish.</li>
    <li> It was good. But the more I used it the light didn&#x27;t work all that well. Other than that I love using it everytime I do my nails</li>
    <li> Works well-  bought as gift for my grand dtr</li>
    <li> Using this for curing UV glue for cellphone repair, it goes a great job for a very low price.</li>
    <li> Lamp is not strong enough to keep gel polish on. It peels right off.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start off by saying I&#x27;m  no pro with gel and shellac polishes but I figured why not buy this and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well if you use a regular polish for basic manicure (or pedi) and use a no chip top coat. Let dry for a few minutes under the light then use an alcohol pad to clean off the sticky residue. Good as the salon quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I took the risk to purchase this. It works sooo well!!</li>
    <li> Arrived  not working.  Thankfully amazon always takes care of you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to just cure gel top coat the price was right and it worked for what I needed it to do. The only CON I have with it is you can only place 4 fingers in at a time or both your thumbs.</li>
    <li> DID NOT EVEN TURN ON&lt;br /&gt;ALSO COSTUMER SERVICE IS AWFUL</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail was extremely excited to try it out.... And when I powered it on it didn&#x27;t turn on. It&#x27;s broken. Checked the lamp it looks good not broken, hooked it up to different outlets thinking they might be defective (didn&#x27;t want to believe it was actually the lamp). Needless to say, I&#x27;m returning it and getting my money back. Damn it.</li>
    <li> I had never used a lamp like this before, but I&#x27;m happy with this one. Save me a lot of time. Dries my nails perfectly, and this way I avoid errors doing my nails. The only inconvenience is has no timer to set, you need to calculate the time yourself. Excellent price vs equipment.</li>
    <li> Super awesome!! Great price</li>
