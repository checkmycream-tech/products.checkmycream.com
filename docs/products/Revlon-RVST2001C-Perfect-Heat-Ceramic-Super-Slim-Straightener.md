      <li>Great</li>
      <li>This straightener is so great that I mailed my receipt to two curly friends and suggested they buy one.  </li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>and she says it gets too warm on the handle.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and does a great job making my hair shiny without damaging it.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s certainly great for quick touch ups, traveling with, shorter hair.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced and works great on straightening hair.  </li>
      <li>This is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>and i was able to do it</li>
      <li>Revlon should make a better product.</li>
      <li>She wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything..:)</li>
      <li>Buy something better for your $25.</li>
      <li>I already had this flat iron and was very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s probably not the best choice if you have long, bushy hair.  </li>
      <li>: Straightens hair effectively, and quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love this style and it gets heated quick!</li>
      <li>It heats quickly, protects my fingers from burning and does a great job in straightening my very curly hair.</li>
      <li>straightener heats up very quickly...</li>
      <li>It is easy to use, and does not burn my hands (a problem when I accidentally touched the edges of my daughter&#x27;s straightening iron).  </li>
      <li>i have slightly wavy hair and it works perfectly at the lowest heat setting.</li>
      <li>It glides through easily and smoothly.  </li>
      <li>i got this straightener as a gift a few years ago and it is the best one i have ever owned!</li>
      <li>A great purchase....just be warned that it is smaller than the norm.</li>
      <li>, it just doesnt get my hair quite as silky smooth as before.</li>
      <li>At first, it works pretty good for a cheap straightener.</li>
      <li>Just like the old model I loved.</li>
      <li>I bought this straightener because it looked just like an older model that I had and liked.</li>
      <li>Well I was excited to get this in the mail,</li>
      <li>It also pulls and tugs, and does not glide easily through my hair so I will probably rarely if ever use it.</li>
      <li>It works great for getting that really straight look, but is gets a little warm around the area you hold while using the iron.</li>
      <li>When my 14 year old got her hair cut and started borrowing mine, I decided she needed her own.  </li>
      <li>I was amazed at how quickly.  </li>
      <li>It wore out verrrry quickly.</li>
      <li>She says it heats quickly, straightens all of her hair (and the Southern humidity makes her hair frizz!), and the smaller size is great to travel with!</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my daughter (after she researched all the straighteners available) and she absolutely LOVES it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;and is very slim and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>Overall, this is a pretty good straightener for the money.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>I had it turned up too high and damaged my hair, but the temperature is easily adjusted.  </li>
      <li>The price is definitely right.    </li>
      <li>works great even if my hair is still a little damp!</li>
      <li>I was also impressed with size/form...pretty good for getting tight spots, especially with black hair...</li>
      <li>It heats up super fast and turns itself off after an hour, a plus if you forget to turn it off sometimes.    </li>
      <li>It straightens pretty well, but tends to leave light lines on my naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It gets hot, but doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re frying your hair.  </li>
      <li>THE SELLER IS FAST!</li>
      <li>The first few times I used it, it worked pretty dang good.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t  get as hot anymore.</li>
      <li>Because of the size, it works better for medium and short hair.</li>
      <li>Nice hair straightener, except I use it to softly curl my short hair.  </li>
      <li>I bought this after reading positive reviews on consumer reports.</li>
      <li>My hair is blonde, fine, and already very straight.  </li>
      <li>I came home from work after forgetting to shut it off, and it was still on, and the whole room smelled from how hot it was.  </li>
      <li>i thought this was going to work very well, but the first day i used it</li>
      <li>The handle gets REALLY un-touchably hot.  </li>
      <li>I am thinking about buying another and hoping it doesn&#x27;t break, but my logical side wants to just buy a nicer one</li>
      <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s really much too hot to press a tie.  </li>
      <li>I thought my friend had destroyed it by trying to straighten her hair with chalk in it to color it, but I was able to clean it with a damp rag after it had dried and it still runs great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have long thick hair and this product works great!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>It is also very highly rated on the Consumer Reports site.  </li>
      <li>Also, it is really</li>
      <li>The red light that indicates it&#x27;s on just dims out as soon as I plug it in</li>
      <li>so you can&#x27;t do too much hair at one time.</li>
      <li>Rated very well by Consumer Reports.</li>
      <li>I also love that it does not fry may hair, which I found with other irons, by adjusting the heat setting based on my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>enjoy using this iron very much, as it has a wide range of</li>
      <li>upon arrival it came to my attention that it is much smaller then a normal Hair Straightener, And it is cheaply made.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and cools down quickly too.  </li>
      <li>Even though it rated this straightener highly, I find that it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>It came highly recommended from Consumer reports.</li>
      <li>This product, which came highly rated, worked for two months then quit.  </li>
      <li>I was very surprised when I received it.  </li>
      <li>This was my first flat iron as I just began to grown my hair</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty straight, and i had to go over my hair like ten times before it actually straightened.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great products from revlon!!!! excellent straightner! I love this style and it gets heated quick! PERFECT! I LOVE IT! THE SELLER IS FAST!</li>
    <li> Nice hair straightener, except I use it to softly curl my short hair.  I have two issues: 1.  The on/off button is in a bad spot as I keep turning off the iron as I am using it.  2.  The cord does not swivel.  Fix those 2 things and it is a great iron at a good price.</li>
    <li> I already had this flat iron and was very happy with it.  When my 14 year old got her hair cut and started borrowing mine, I decided she needed her own.  She specifically asked for the same one I had.  She said she had tried several of her friends&#x27; flat irons but didn&#x27;t like them as well.  This Revlon glides and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.  It&#x27;s lightweight and inexpensive yet very effective.  I initially chose it because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports.  It isn&#x27;t colorful or flashy like some flat irons but it&#x27;s a great product at a great price.  Great deal![[ASIN:B001AFKEBO Revlon RVST2001C Perfect Heat Ceramic Super Slim Straightener]]</li>
    <li> This product, which came highly rated, worked for two months then quit.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  Revlon should make a better product.</li>
    <li> It works great for getting that really straight look, but is gets a little warm around the area you hold while using the iron. I have really short hair so its not a big deal, but my daughter has really long hair and she says it gets too warm on the handle.</li>
    <li> I bought this product this summer and it won&#x27;t turn on anymore!! The red light that indicates it&#x27;s on just dims out as soon as I plug it in and it never heats up. I loved it until it stopped working. I am thinking about buying another and hoping it doesn&#x27;t break, but my logical side wants to just buy a nicer one so I don&#x27;t keep wasting my money. TORN.</li>
    <li> i got this straightener as a gift a few years ago and it is the best one i have ever owned! i have slightly wavy hair and it works perfectly at the lowest heat setting. i think its worn out a little through the years but i use it almost every day, it just doesnt get my hair quite as silky smooth as before. my only complaint is that it has the velvet part on the outside. i tried to curl my hair and i was able to do it but the fabric made it difficult.</li>
    <li> i bought this a while back and it states that it heats up to 400* f, umm no it doesn&#x27;t (if anything to like 100). i thought this was going to work very well, but the first day i used it i realized i had gotten ripped off. i dont even have thick or curly hair- it&#x27;s pretty straight, and i had to go over my hair like ten times before it actually straightened. i would NOT recommend this to anyone!!!!</li>
    <li> Heats up fast, straightens my hair, doesn&#x27;t pull like some other inexpensive models.  All this and at 1/3d to 1/4th the price of a CHI.</li>
    <li> Hi I ordered this as a Christmas gift, so it hasn&#x27;t been used yet? It arrived in good time and am looking forward to my daughters reaction. It came highly recommended from Consumer reports.</li>
    <li> Overall, this is a pretty good straightener for the money.  It heats up quickly and cools down quickly too.  It gets hot, but doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re frying your hair.  Straightens hair nicely although, unlike really expensive hair strengtheners, when you straighten your hair, you can sometimes get some hairs that stick up; problem can be fixed using a light misting of hair spray or other hair products.  Saw this product in consumer reports.  Would recommend to those who don&#x27;t want to buy a straightener for $100+.</li>
    <li> We purchased this to straighten my 9 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  It works well.  It has exceeded our expectations.</li>
    <li> My mom bought this straightener for me a while back. It was $30 but was on sale for 50% off. The first few times I used it, it worked pretty dang good. It&#x27;s very small so you can&#x27;t do too much hair at one time. I couldn&#x27;t imagine using it on think hair. It wore out verrrry quickly. It didn&#x27;t  get as hot anymore. I just gave it away to my friend because I did not want it anymore. At first, it works pretty good for a cheap straightener. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Buy something better for your $25.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Rated very well by Consumer Reports. I have long thick hair and this product works great!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT!  This was recommended by Consumer Reports and it is an excellent product.  Reasonably priced and works great on straightening hair.  It&#x27;s a little smaller than a standard size so it&#x27;s probably not the best choice if you have long, bushy hair.  But it&#x27;s certainly great for quick touch ups, traveling with, shorter hair.  Very good value.</li>
    <li> Used three times and it stopped working. Was given as a gift ans was the second Revlon straigthener I tried. The other one would rip the hair out of my head. This one was rated well on Consumer Reports but I was not impressed.</li>
    <li> *Husbands Account* Well I was excited to get this in the mail, upon arrival it came to my attention that it is much smaller then a normal Hair Straightener, And it is cheaply made. But the looks dont bother me as long as the product works, But sadly it dose not work on my thick curly hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading positive reviews on consumer reports. Even though it rated this straightener highly, I find that it doesn&#x27;t work well. If I take a lot of time, it will eventually sort of straighten my hair. It also pulls and tugs, and does not glide easily through my hair so I will probably rarely if ever use it. I have bought other cheaper straighteners in the past that worked fine, but this one convinced me to go for a pricier model. I will try to return it, but I know that will be a hassle...Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. It heats quickly, protects my fingers from burning and does a great job in straightening my very curly hair.</li>
    <li> straightener heats up very quickly...I was amazed at how quickly.  I was also impressed with size/form...pretty good for getting tight spots, especially with black hair...I really like the product and plan on purchasing several for Christmas presents for family/friends</li>
    <li> I do a lot of traveling, and every now and then I get a wrinkle on a tie or a collar.  Well, it seems ridiculous to have to get an entire iron up and running to fix these little things, so I thought this Revlon product would be just the thing.  It&#x27;s got \\&quot;perfect heat\\&quot;, and the slim size fits neatly in the pocket of my carry-on.  Anyway, it&#x27;s really much too hot to press a tie.  I&#x27;ve tried almost everything, including pre-soaking the tie, dampening the wrinkle with a little cologne, even putting the tie between a couple of pieces of paper.  Ruined two ties before giving up.  Don&#x27;t try it!</li>
    <li> I have medium-curly hair, but usually wear it straightened.  This straightener is so great that I mailed my receipt to two curly friends and suggested they buy one.  It is also very highly rated on the Consumer Reports site.  It is so thin and narrow that I can even straighten the little gimpy waves on my forehead. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was not aware that this straightener is a very short one.  It is actually a mini-sized straightener.  I was very surprised when I received it.  The price is definitely right.    It straightens pretty well, but tends to leave light lines on my naturally curly hair.  It is easy to use, and does not burn my hands (a problem when I accidentally touched the edges of my daughter&#x27;s straightening iron).  It heats up super fast and turns itself off after an hour, a plus if you forget to turn it off sometimes.    I had it turned up too high and damaged my hair, but the temperature is easily adjusted.  I think I am just inexperienced with these things.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter (after she researched all the straighteners available) and she absolutely LOVES it! She says it heats quickly, straightens all of her hair (and the Southern humidity makes her hair frizz!), and the smaller size is great to travel with! She wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything..:)</li>
    <li> I bought this because consumer reports gave it a glowing recommendation.  Unfortunately it fell flat of my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Straightens hair effectively, and quickly.  IT doesn&#x27;t rip your hair out like some flat irons do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The heating element is in the handle with little protection for your hands.  The handle gets REALLY un-touchably hot.  Also, it is supposed to automatically shut off after 30 minutes, but it DOESN&#x27;T WORK!  I came home from work after forgetting to shut it off, and it was still on, and the whole room smelled from how hot it was.  I am really lucky it didn&#x27;t burn down my home!  Also, it is really small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I began to hate this thing more with each use.  The handle was sooo hot, and the thing is so small.  Thank goodness it died.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Because of the size, it works better for medium and short hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 2 years ago and it is still running great. I thought my friend had destroyed it by trying to straighten her hair with chalk in it to color it, but I was able to clean it with a damp rag after it had dried and it still runs great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, naturally straightish hair about halfway down my back and this straightener is kind of small, but it only takes me about 15 minutes to straighten my entire head. It is great for dealing with my bangs because I don&#x27;t worry about burning myself. I will be buying this same product when (if) my current one ever dies!</li>
    <li> This was my first flat iron as I just began to grown my hair longer.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy using this iron very much, as it has a wide range of heat&lt;br /&gt;and is very slim and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectations.  It did not straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> It heats up fast and does not pull or break the hair, but it is a bit small to do a whole head of hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because it was recommended by consumer reports and it is awesome! I have wavy, medium length hair and it takes me about 10 min to use the straightener...works great even if my hair is still a little damp!</li>
    <li> Lives up to billing. Straightens well, even on thick hair. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> on/off switch broke after 3 months</li>
    <li> I purchased this because Consumer Reports gave it a good rating.  It works ok, but not great.  It is small so if you have long hair like I do it takes forever to straighten all of the hair.  The price was a fraction of the Chi flat iron I bought years ago, and I can tell.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because it looked just like an older model that I had and liked. When it came, I was a little surprised because while it looked the same, it was quite a bit smaller. I have shorter hair so I didn&#x27;t think that would be a problem for me. I tried it and it worked great! Just like the old model I loved. It heats up quickly and does a great job making my hair shiny without damaging it. A great purchase....just be warned that it is smaller than the norm.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic!  It heats up in less than a minute, and decreased the time to straighten my hair.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never worked with a flat iron and was a bit nervous however, this iron works like a charm.  I have frizzy, stubborn hair and it looks great after I&#x27;m done spending about 20 minutes.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I found this to be perfect for me.  I had previously owned a considerably more expensive iron, and it died after only a few months.  I purchased this one after seeing its rating on Consumer Reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike my previous one, this one does not pull out my hair at all.  It glides through easily and smoothly.  I also love that it does not fry may hair, which I found with other irons, by adjusting the heat setting based on my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  My hair is blonde, fine, and already very straight.  I use a flat iron for a more polished look, as well as to put a slight curl in my bangs and along the sides to frame my face.</li>
