<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Blessing is great for the scalp and an excellent conditioner for locks.</li>
    <li> So far so good as expected  :) Thank you</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. My daughter&#x27;s hair texture has improved tremendously. Hair growth is also taking place.</li>
    <li> This hair pomade is in my opinion, the best pomade on the market. I do not claim to be an expert on pomades but in addition to Nature&#x27;s Blessing I have used Murray&#x27;s, Dax, Royal Crown Pomade, and Badger and while I like aspects of each of these pomades, they don&#x27;t compare to Nature&#x27;s Blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold - I&#x27;ll start straight away by saying that it works... really well. I have straight medium fine hair and tend to wear it on the shorter side. if my hair had its way, it would lay forward, but I prefer it slicked back. This pomade makes that challenge a reality with very little work. It doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or sticky like some pomades or stain your pillowcase like others. It doesn&#x27;t harden or flake. You can apply it in the morning and the hold will last all day. You can even comb through it for restyling after some rogue winds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent - This stuff smells clean. It may be a bit more on the masculine side of the spectrum, but it could be unisex too. It reminds me of soap to be honest... Irish Spring soap. Some have described it as minty, but that is not exactly what I get. Mint is as much a part of the profile as rosemary or sage... it is in there, but the take away is fresh, clean, soap. The most important aspect of the scent is that my lady likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shine - This pomade has a good shine to it. Truth be told, that was the one aspect of using pomade that was hard for me to get used to. But the shine is there and it is nice. It may not be for some, but once you adjust to seeing your self with shiny hair, you come to appreciate it. I wouldn&#x27;t describe the look as greasy but understand why some reviewers use this description. I would apply that to most pomades. It is just the nature of the beast. I think this shine makes the hair look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients - You can have a pomade that holds great, smells good, and looks fantastic but, if it thrashes your hair or scalp what good is it? This pomade contains quality ingredients and the proof is in the condition it leaves your hair and scalp. For me, the results are very good with soft hair and an itch free scalp. Nature&#x27;s Blessing is made from Nettle, Rosemary, Sage, Peppermint, Thyme, Alfalfa, Pure Virgin Olive Oil, Pure Coconut Oil, Sage Oil, Rosemary Oil, Bergamot Oil, Chlorophyll (from nettle and spinach), Pure Mineral Jelly, Natural Fragrance and Good Intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiences vary but my experience with this pomade has been really nice. I have even turned a couple of friends who were looking to kick the gel habit on to Nature&#x27;s Blessings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps you pick the right pomade for your hair.and the proof is in the condition it leaves your hair and scalp.

    <li> Best product for growing hair...... Love it!</li>
    <li> I love using this pomade for my hair, I found it in 2007 and haven&#x27;t used anything else. Glad I can get it online now.</li>
    <li> This is such a good deal. 6 jars for the price some are charging for one. this is about the only product I use for my locs. Moisturizes my scalp just right. I love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a while back. However,I am on my last jar. Therefore,I must make a second purchase. In my opinion this product is extremely effective, in spite of the mineral based contained thereof. This product doesn&#x27;t  weight your hair down,it smooth split ends and rapidly deslove leaving no greasy residue. I have been utilizing this product while wearing protective styles, for a lengthy duration and will continue using this product.The results are amazing. It&#x27;s a miracle tool that have grown my hair a great deal.</li>
    <li> this is the best hair product that I&#x27;ve ever used, please keep up the good work making this product, love it</li>
    <li> I like this hair pomade VERY MUCH, but this last shipment from AMAZON was stale or the manufacturer is cutting corners.  It is a natural product and for years, the scent was relatively the same, varying slightly.  But now, the scent is completely muted so that it&#x27;s almost non-existent.  When people buy this, they expect the certain smell they have become accustomed to.  I had to add in essential oils to at least get it to smell like something I&#x27;d want to put in my hair.  Hopefully this stock will have depleted by the time I order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the smell, the product feels the same and does not appear to have mold or anything.  Hopefully it will perform the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed because it has a very soothing scent usually that&#x27;s very relaxing and inviting.  The batch I received did not and it&#x27;s only because I make homemade toiletries that I even have essential oils on hand to &#x27;doctor it up&#x27;.  I put 6 drops each of Calendula herbal oil, tea tree essential oil, rosemary essential oil and lemongrass essential oil in it.  Smells good now, but I prefer the scent it should have been.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this item arrived with two of the glass jars broken and two damaged from leakage. I like this product but can&#x27;t seem to get a shipment that arrives without broken or damaged jars. This was the second shipment I had to return within 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> Great scent and it is the quality we have been accustomed to. I like buying this in bulk because I can share this great product with friends.</li>
    <li> Product delivered just as advertised.  Fast Shipping! I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought this on a visit to Harlem and I absolutley loved it.  It moisturizes my locs without buildup and a greasy feeling.  Plus it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I love natures blessing and the price was amazing</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased this product. It is very lightweight, smells good and it has all natural ingredients. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> The scent is to die for and it provides the moisture I need. Great product.</li>
    <li> just the right amount of oil to make my hair shiny without a greasy look.  i would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I love this product. I first purchased it at a flea market in GA. At first, I was skeptical about trying it. After its first use, I liked it because it was not very greasy and it didn&#x27;t cause my head to itch as much before my quarterly touch ups. Couldn&#x27;t find it anymore at the flea market, so I went searching for it online. Glad I found it. My husband loves to use it on his face. It&#x27;s great, love the smell of it. Will continue to purchase it whenever I need it.</li>
    <li> This pomade really moisturizes the hair. It leaves the hair soft and shiny, It does not leave alot of build up.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product for skin &amp; hair,  I just love it! Natural and wonderful! the best thing about this particular purchase was the price this is an unbelievable price for this I really thought I was only getting one!</li>
    <li> This is the best kept secret to moisturize hair. You can use from the baby to an adult. I love it and I got it at an awesome price.</li>
    <li> Keeps your hair smelling fresh, helps dry skin ,chapped lips, and promotes hair growth. Thanks Amazon , I&#x27;ve been looking for natures blessings and the best deal was on Amazon !</li>
    <li> i was pleased with my purchase. the price was excellent, i used to pay $10 per jar. none of the jars were broken. it was shipped in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Great product, great packaging!</li>
    <li> I love this natural hair pomade.  Its full of the best oils such as: virgin olive oil, coconut oil, sage and rosemary oil.  I don&#x27;t only limit this to my hair, but I also apply it to my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I made sure to stock up on it while I had the chance. I use this in my hair every day.</li>
    <li> This is the only pomade I use to moisturize my scalp and locks between washings. It&#x27;s light, has a nice smell and makes my hair look lively. Keep up the good work Nature&#x27;s Blessings!</li>
    <li> Nature&#x27;s Blessings Hair Pomade has blessed me!  What else can I say... this is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used in my life - from the very first time I used it my hair immediately looked healthy, felt fuller and smelled like it was just washed.  The scent is so amazing - so refreshing!  But most importantly, it makes your hair look and feel healthy!  Kudos to Nature&#x27;s Blessings Hair Pomade!</li>
    <li> Love this hair grease. It smells wonderful and makes the hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I use this to twist my locs. I like it. It has the same consistency as a hair grease such as Royal Crown Pomade, if you do not like mineral jelly based products, then you will not like this. I love it. It leaves my hair shiny and moisturized for days. I only like using it in the winter when it&#x27;s cold out and the air is dry. During the summer, the product is too sticky for my liking. I think it would be great for a twist or braid out too. The price of this seller varies.  I buy only buy this product when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
    <li> Arrived quicky, [[ASIN:B004OVFMRW Case of 6 Jars Nature&#x27;s Blessings Hair Pomade 4 Oz Each]]I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> The best very light and the best scent on the market!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nature&#x27;s Blessing for about 15 years now.  Always bought it in NYC for very cheap ($1.50 a jar).  So when I found it on Amazon for the almost the same price, I jumped on it.  6 for $9.99!!  Now I come back out of curiosity and it&#x27;s $29.99!!!  Why?!?!</li>
    <li> love this stuff- just be careful not to use too much, have tried numerous hair gels and nothing comes close to the real thing</li>
    <li> Our favorite family hair pomade now and several years past.  This will not let you down.  Best all-around hair dressing...hands down!!</li>
    <li> This is a special pomade made with good stuff.  Makes my hair feel soft and moisturized without being greasy and I really like the scent it leaves.  These jars run about $3 in Afrocentric/ natural/ beauty stores . I was disgusted at how expensive they were being priced from other sellers, but this purchase was probably the best deal I ever brought on Amazon. Now I have enough to last a while. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this pomade I used it in 1999 on my daughters hair it made it smell real good and the shine was nice. I also notice how it made her hair more manageable. I was looking for it for a long time so now that I found it I will always purchase it from here.</li>
    <li> Finding a product that is both natural and appealing is hard in the black hair care products available today. I stumbled upon my first jar in a store in DC and went searching for it on Amazon of course. Although a little more expensive, it smells amazing and works well.</li>
    <li> Amazing buy would love if they had this deal again super great</li>
    <li> Great product. As a guy, my hair and scalp have always been more on the coarse and dry side. After using Nature&#x27;s Blessings, I don&#x27;t think they have ever looked or felt better. The pomades and gels that I had been using would wreck my hair if I didn&#x27;t wash them out at night. I can leave Nature&#x27;s Blessings in overnight and it just keeps my hair nice and soft. After a shower, I can&#x27;t wait to reapply to my hair and scalp. I love the scent too. It&#x27;s great to be able to get away from the chemical smells of most hair products you find.</li>
    <li> I have spent tons of money trying to locate a product that works well for me, so by the time I found this one, I was at the end of my rope.  I&#x27;d cut my hair down to a &amp;#34;brush cut&amp;#34; so that bald spots wouldn&#x27;t be as noticeable. This product has helped my hair to grow back in the bald spots &amp; all over, and the rate at which my hair is growing is incredible!  In addition, this product is perfect for my hair type (thick and course, but soft) and really enhances my natural curl pattern.  Kudos!</li>
    <li> Loved this hair grease arrived in time, great smell and lasted us awhile</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Appears to be quite great for the skin too... I wholeheartedly recommend this for hair and skin health.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT....I LOVE IT.....</li>
    <li> This product is worth every dime and more. Grows hair wonderfully and keeps it healthy. Initially made my scalp a little itchy but quickly became very comfortable. I had to actually slow my usage because I wear my hair short and it was growing very quickly. Gave a jar to a co-worker who was losing her hair and she absolutely loved it. It grew her hair back and she has recommended it to several others. Even works well on men. My daughters refuse to use anything else. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like it because it makes my hair soft but the jar is too small for the money. it only lasts 3 weeks</li>
