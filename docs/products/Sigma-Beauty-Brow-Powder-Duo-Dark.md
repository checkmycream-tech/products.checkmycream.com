    <li> These is the second experience for me very wonderful product and excellent stability</li>
    <li> Love the duo powder. Get so many complements.  And blends well</li>
    <li> Sigma Brow Powder Duo is a good product, you get a good color contrast. The light color goes on easy, and looks a little red on the skin. The dark color is bold and blends in with almost-black but not black eyebrows. Excellent for shaping.</li>
    <li> PACKAGED NICELY. REALLY PIGMENTED AND BLENDS NICELY. I USE IT NOT ONLY FOR MY EYEBROWS, BUT SOMETIMES AS AN EYESHADOW AS WELL. I HAVE HAD IT FOR SOME TIME NOW AND IT STILL LOOKS BRAND NEW. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>

    <li> A bit lower price point than Anastasia brow powder. Seemingly there&#x27;s more of the product as well. Works just as great or better than Anastasia. Will order again</li>
    <li> Love it! I have pale skin and dark hair/eyebrows and the dark colors worked perfect. A little goes a long way so I&#x27;m sure this will last me a while.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 27 year old daughter who was trying to let her over tweezed eyebrows grow back in. She loved the product and the way it looked. I bought an angled brow brush with it and the combination gave her a sleek. polished look. Very nice product, arrived in the mail quickly and on time.</li>
    <li> Makes your eyebrows look full and beautiful it is easy to apply and goes on smoothly when applying it on</li>
    <li> I have a very fair complexion and almost black hair. My eyebrows are darker than my hair (dark brown). It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve purchased that doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous once it&#x27;s applied. My only issue with this product is that it&#x27;s all over the place. If you&#x27;re purchasing this to carry around with you, be wary. The container doesn&#x27;t really contain it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, the real deal and shipped very fast!</li>

    <li> I have bought my first sigma thing. No regrets! Brow powder is of a very good quality. The delivery was on time!</li>
    <li> Love it. Came on time. Good price. Powder was not crumbling. I tried the tester version before i bought it so i knew what color to get.</li>
    <li> Love it! Normally I would fill in my brows with dark eyeshadow, but then I decide to purchase this and I&#x27;m glad I did! It stays on my eyebrows ALL day. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or anything! Highly recommend :)</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! That&#x27;s pretty much it lol. I&#x27;ve tried many eyebrow filling products but none have compared to this product. Thanks to the creators:))</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good product. Although it was broken when I got it ! So I have it all dusty. I am not satisfied with this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have one eyebrow that isn&#x27;t as thick the other.&lt;br /&gt; I wanted to be able to fill in the blank spots. It works great!&lt;br /&gt;And the color is perfect. I will buy this again as the powder is creamy, and easy&lt;br /&gt;to apply. The case opens easily, and is a nice size.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have black/brown hair and verrry dark brows. I tried using other products and my brows always looked too dark and unnatural. Until now... I use the dark color in this duo and it looks amazing! Perfect for women with very dark hair. Very natural and it lasts forever. Worth every penny folks</li>
    <li> Excellent brow powder! Stays on all day!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am able to do an abundant of brows becase I can custom blend the colors!  I love !</li>
    <li> Amazing! This powder is SO PIGMENTED! Anastasia does NOT COMPARE!  I almost didn&#x27;t purchase because I have so many brow products and powders never seem to impress me much, as in I can&#x27;t just where a powder I have to use something else to give my brows depth...Not anymore! This is the first powder I can apply and put clear gel and be DONE! It&#x27;s perfection! The lighter shade is a bit to warm with red undertones for me, but the dark side is perfection and I just use a light hand at the front of my brow. I think I am even going to purchase the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; pot to add some dimension. If anyone is even hesitating, don&#x27;t! This is extraordinary!</li>
