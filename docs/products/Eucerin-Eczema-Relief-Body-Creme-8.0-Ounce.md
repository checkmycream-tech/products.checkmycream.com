      <li>This eucerin product is great.  </li>
      <li>Eucerin is a great product, it seemed to help ease the itch from my excema.</li>
      <li>And this does a great job of protecting my hands.</li>
      <li>this Eucerin eczema creme is great for a family where everyone seems to have skin that gets irritated.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The ingredients are also designed to build your skin&#x27;s barrier, and the ceramides are supposedly very effective for that.  </li>
      <li>the best part is I&#x27;ve had no skin irritation which seems to be a problem with most moisturizers</li>
      <li>But I do rate the product 4 stars instead of 5, not because it isn&#x27;t good within the limits that can&#x27;t be avoided, but because it&#x27;s over-hyped.</li>
      <li>But the good thing is that is provides relief to irritated skin.</li>
      <li>Good cream, but do not overestimate it&#x27;s power</li>
      <li>Light scent, not greasy, very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Not as good as I had hoped for.</li>
      <li>stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as controlling the itchiness as well as</li>
      <li>So good for the skin.</li>
      <li>Eczema Relief Body Creme by Eucerin is a good product.  </li>
      <li>the good products I use at night couldnt get to my skin to work - this stuff is a barrier - now that cant be good for ezema...smothering,</li>
      <li>Before this I had a Gold Bond eczema relief lotion that was not as good as this product.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as some reviews said.</li>
      <li>very satisfied...</li>
      <li>Also, contains an effective ingredient against eczema - oatmeal, and also has licochalcone and ceramides - which all work together well and provide a good eczema relief.</li>
      <li>We were using Aveeno for Eczema and liked it a lot, but I wanted to see if this might also be a good reliever.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is rich and creamy, yet penetrates beautifully, leaving our skin happy :)</li>
      <li>Glad I got it!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re consistently some of the best you can find.</li>

      <li>I was not compensated in any way for this review, and paid for my own product.  </li>
      <li>moisturized and feels kind of water resistant as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am astonished that an over-the-counter product is so effective on my skin.  </li>
      <li>GB is extremely good, but this works a bit better.</li>
      <li>The thickness was something that I really liked about this product.</li>
      <li>honestly my skin is still flaring</li>
      <li>really liked this lotion a lot</li>
      <li>This new creme, specifically designed to treat eczema, is another excellent tool in your arsenal.</li>
      <li>so I use this at night and they feel better and look better!</li>
      <li>No one should expect complete relief from a non-steroid cream, but this lotion is perfect for not making me itchier--in fact, I&#x27;ve had no issues with itching since I started using the product.  </li>
      <li>Excellent care for my sensitive baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>This is by far the one that works the best for my son.  </li>
      <li>Wow, completely impressed.  </li>
      <li>Better lid design would be nice.</li>
      <li>Think this stuff is wonderful, and the formula is a very rich gel cream that is highly emollient.  </li>
      <li>The smooth creme spreads easily but doesn&#x27;t absorb great.</li>
      <li>I mostly grew out of my eczema but still get it every winter on my hands and legs...  </li>
      <li>great item, fast shipping</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>So many soothing cremes contain aloe vera, which I am allergic to, so finding something without</li>
      <li>Most lubricant lotions help to minimize the discomfort of eczema, but do not delay the onset of flare-ups or resist the worsening of flare-ups once they are underway.  </li>
      <li>This was an ok moisturizer but didn&#x27;t stop the redness or itching.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it because my child&#x27;s skin looks much better.</li>
      <li>i didn&#x27;t love.</li>
      <li>I used almost every lotion on the market to find I was allergic to most, including my allergic reaction to alveeno.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A lot of eucerin products leave my hands feeling Greasy. However this one doesn&#x27;t. It absorbs well and Provides a protective barrier on my skin. It is very soothing to my contact dermatitis. Nothing works like a steroid. But this is great to use throughout the day. I am a nurse and wash my hands frequently. And this does a great job of protecting my hands.</li>
    <li> Not as good as some reviews said. It is only a moisturizer, no more.</li>
    <li> Great product - this helped clear up my daughter&#x27;s Eczema.</li>
    <li> works well - i will keep using</li>
    <li> I have Excema and use this cream daily.</li>
    <li> This product has outperformed every eczema cream or lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I use it on my entire body, including my face (sparingly in the a.m.; as a very rich night cream p.m.) and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It is richer than Eucerin&#x27;s Calming Creme, but has a similar texture, and is truly long-lasting.  So many soothing cremes contain aloe vera, which I am allergic to, so finding something without it is a Godsend.  It has a slight cooling sensation (I assume from the licorice), and sinks in relatively quickly for a product of this type.  It even works on my crusty feet, and I can&#x27;t say that about any other product.  No one should expect complete relief from a non-steroid cream, but this lotion is perfect for not making me itchier--in fact, I&#x27;ve had no issues with itching since I started using the product.  This is a home run from Eucerin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I was not compensated in any way for this review, and paid for my own product.  I am just an ordinary person trying to figure out what works without breaking the bank!</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent care for my sensitive baby&#x27;s skin. He&#x27;s battling eczema, and this really soothes and moisturizes without any smells or greasy film.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Body Cr&amp;egrave;me, Eczema Relief does just what it says. It relieves itch and works really well. There is no fragrance, dye or steroids in it. It is a rich mixture, almost the consistency of toothpaste and it rubs in quickly. I have prescription cr&amp;egrave;me is that not as soothing as this one. In fact, to tolerate the prescription cr&amp;egrave;me, I have to add petroleum jelly. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My son actually tried this product for his eczema, I don&#x27;t know if it because eczema&lt;br /&gt;is really bad he may need to see a doctor but it didn&#x27;t work for rashes&lt;br /&gt;but it works for irritated skin especially like&lt;br /&gt;mosquitos bumps, I used it for that&lt;br /&gt;what I also like its very lite not a strong fragrance</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from eczema.  I do suffer from combination skin.  My arms are fine, but my elbows are dry. My legs are fine but my ankles are dry.  My upper arms get dry where my short sleeves rub.  But I also live in Florida where it&#x27;s very humid but somehow I still have these dry area&#x27;s that get itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin works.  It moisturizes my dry spots but doesn&#x27;t make me itchy or greasy.  There was no detectable smell in my opinion.  I did not smell the product from the bottle but instead smelled my skin after application.  No smell.  Also no stains on my bedding, since I apply before sleep, this is important to me.</li>
    <li> Trying to find the right all-around moisturizer or lotion for eczema is a nightmare and we all seem to have bottles of failures in the bathroom and wasted money. I was looking for a cream that was moisturizing enough without swimming in greasiness,and this so far is really working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is rich and creamy, and I can work it into my skin after a bath--without using up my prescription cream all over or an expensive face cream. The bottle was surprisingly bigger than I expected and I am sure it will last me 2-3 months or more with the amount I use.</li>
    <li> I have a scar on my arm that continues to itch and peel. I don&#x27;t think its eczema but its been itching for atleast 2 weeks now. After using the creme for about 4 days, the peeling has stopped completely and the itch have subsided. I believe this works, it&#x27;s not an immediate fix, but after several uses it has made a difference.</li>
    <li> I do not have Eczema but I do have dry itchy elbow and knees sometimes and this cr&amp;egrave;me relieved the itchiness immediately.  After two applications I also noticed that my darkened dry elbows and knees were soft and generally better.  I have also used it on the dry patches on my heels and it has improved it better than my regular foot cream.  I will continue to use to see how it works and will definitely be buying the cr&amp;egrave;me again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got sensitive skin or eczema, you probably already know about Eucerin&#x27;s products. They&#x27;re consistently some of the best you can find. This new creme, specifically designed to treat eczema, is another excellent tool in your arsenal. Faint, pleasant scent and soothing relief.</li>
    <li> Best lotion you can get if you have Ezcema</li>
    <li> I HAVE FOUND CERAVA WORKS MUCH BETTER ON MY SKIN THAN ALLTHE ECZEMA CREAMS!</li>
    <li> Not greasy or scented.  Works great!</li>
    <li> This was an ok moisturizer but didn&#x27;t stop the redness or itching. I used for 3 days, with no relief in sight, so I switched back to my Aveeno eczema cream, which provides immediate and long lasting relief. It also seemed tacky on the skin - took a while to sink in, so I could not put clothes on immediately following lotion application.</li>
    <li> This is such a great size. I&#x27;ve begun using this on my dry scaly areas and I am already seeing improvements. The dark spots on my chests has started to even out my skin tone. The only thing I hate is that this has no smell.</li>
    <li> I had eczema for a couple years on my hands until I found this stuff!  Great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is way too thick. even after heating it up to try and thin it down, it is like rubbing a heavy oil all over. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be absorbed by skin either. As I sit here waiting to put my shirt back on.....The oiliness feeling is very uncomfortable! They should re-formulate so that it is absorbed. I really like Eucerin products, and use many with good results. I just had a sudden outbreak of a body covering rash from using a product called Move Free Ultra that had poultry collagen in it that caused this horrendous allergic reaction rash, but that&#x27;s another story..</li>
    <li> Best lotion out there. Does wonders for my skin, and my daughters. She has scratchy alligator skin on her hands when I don&#x27;t use it. Most lotions don&#x27;t even touch it. This stuff is rich and creamy, yet penetrates beautifully, leaving our skin happy :)</li>
    <li> Thrilled to review this Eucerin Body Creme because it was much needed in our household.  My young daughter has red bumps on the backside of her arms (just above her elbows) and I&#x27;ve noticed they get worse in the summer after spending so much time in the sun and chlorine pools.  This cream has wiped away any red bumps that existed prior to use.  The fragrance is pleasing with a fresh clean smell.  I lather this creme on my heels prior to going to bed and I wake up with smooth, silky soft heels.  No more being embarrassed with dry flaky heels that look disgusting while wearing sandals this summer!  I&#x27;m off to the store to get more - definitely can&#x27;t live with out this creme!</li>
    <li> Had tried sample at pharmacy , was pleased with result , thus ordered with Amazon... very satisfied... excellent itch relieve</li>
    <li> This has been a dry winter and I have been fighting dry, patchy skin since fall. I saw this product advertised on TV and had to give it a try. It&#x27;s rather thick which makes it a great hand cream but a little too heavy for a body cream. I won&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
    <li> I like it, but not as well as another product I am using. It keeps the eczema from itching, but thought it might help the psoriasis....</li>
    <li> Bought this for daughter and used hers. Found it works better for my dry skin than anything else I have Used.</li>
    <li> I really like how thick and emollient this lotion is.  When I&#x27;ve used it, it helps soothe my irritated skin right away, and helps calm the redness down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it is so thick, however, I have to be careful with where and how I apply it; if my eczema is acting up on my hands, I have to apply this sparingly to the affected areas or else risk having greasy hands for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are also designed to build your skin&#x27;s barrier, and the ceramides are supposedly very effective for that.  Another reviewer commented on the strong scent, but, to me, it really is fragrance-free.  It is also free from steriods and dyes, and doesn&#x27;t contain parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I really like how well this works, I&#x27;m  not sure if I&#x27;ll continue to use it since one of the main ingredients in it is mineral oil, which I try to avoid since my experience has been that it&#x27;s a cheap filler that, while it works well to keep moisture in the skin, still doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;breathable\\&quot; to me as other occlusive agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon isn&#x27;t including the ingredient list, but I&#x27;m copying it here from the Eucerin website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Active Ingredients: Colloidal Oatmeal 1.0%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Inactive Ingredients: Water, Glycerin, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mineral Oil, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Octyldodecanol, Cetyl Palmitate, PEG-40 Stearate, Glycyrrhiza Inflata Root Extract, Ceramide 3, 1,2-Hexanediol, Phenoxyethanol, Piroctone Olamine, Caprylyl Glycol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Benzyl Alcohol, Citric Acid.</li>
    <li> Eucerin is a well-known product and for the most part, performs well. This cream is no different. It last a long time and isn&#x27;t greasy like other products. I highly recommend this cream for those suffering from excessive dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive, dry, rashy skin with the occasional eczema.  As a nurse I&#x27;m washing my hands all day, leading to dry cracked hands.  This eucerin product is great.  My skin cracked less and it helped with the redness and pain.  I also used this on my body for super dry, itchy skin.  Again it exceeded my expectations.  I am adding Eucerin to my collection of helpful body creams.</li>
    <li> As good if not better than any cream I&#x27;ve ever used on my face and that&#x27;s coming from someone who has chronic dry skin I now get the automatic delivery song never without it</li>
    <li> I paid for one and received two ! Very fast shipping. That being said , I have a two year old daughter with severe eczema and this has been helping the itch and flakey skin quite well. I also use the body wash! Works great !</li>
    <li> Stops itching. Moisturizes well &amp; is not scented.</li>
    <li> this keeps my skin hydrated all day and has helped with my split nails the best part is I&#x27;ve had no skin irritation which seems to be a problem with most moisturizers</li>
    <li> I had a prescription from a doctor to treat my eczema but, this works so much better.  I love it.</li>
    <li> My son has Eczema and I thought this would be the best product for him.  Turns out it wasn&#x27;t.  It didn&#x27;t bring him relief.  However, Aveno Baby was his answer.  Must be a child to child thing.  You can try it to see if it works, it just didn&#x27;t for us.</li>
    <li> You pay for the name and it delivers.  I don&#x27;t think this is anything more special than the next product as it is over the counter.  They are all pretty much the same but this is very good for calming down the dry itchy skin</li>
    <li> It was recommend on Dr Oz and it works great. I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it because my child&#x27;s skin looks much better.</li>
    <li> I LIKE EUCERIN CREME , I NOTICED IMMEDIATE  SOOTHING AFFECT ON MY IRRITATED SKIN, IT IT LIGHT AND DOES NOT MAKE CLOTHES LOOK OILY, IT IS VERY GOOD, THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I suffer from eczema and thought this product might help. It didn&#x27;t sting like many others do, but it also did not moisturizer as well as I wanted. My skin absorbed the lotion well, no residue or anything left on clothes. I will continue to use it in hopes it improves my skin, but it has already been over a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll freely admit that I do not have eczema, but I do have dermographism, and while I recognize that that condition is more of an internal thing than an external thing, my dermatologist has repeatedly told me that I must keep my skin moistened with good quality lotion because the dryer it is, the worse it&#x27;s going to be. My legs are the most affected area. My doctor actually recommends Eucerin, but I had never tried this particularly one so I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a large pump bottle of the regular Eucerin and I can tell you that the difference in thickness is quite significant. This creme is thicker than the regular one, but it goes on just as smooth. It really coated my legs well and left them feeling soft and EXTREMELY moisturized (which is exactly what I need). The thickness was something that I really liked about this product. I felt like my legs were actually being protected from something with such a thick layer of creme!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this lotion a lot and I would buy it again. I felt that the quality was so worth the money (honestly, I feel this way about all Eucerin products) and the moisture lasted for a long time, unlike a lot of lotions. All hail, Eucerin!</li>
    <li> I have eczema and struggled finding a cream that would give me some relief.  This is the only cream that could touch the itching and soreness.  I found it at Amazon for the best price anywhere.I suspect I&#x27;ll be buying more; probably for some time yet...</li>
    <li> No more dry skin or eczema, using for a few months now. I would highly recommend it for itch free skin.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this is what my face looks like right now.  Had had eczema in the past, but what I have now is a version of hives that was instigated by a bug bite.  So I tried this cream hoping to calm my complexion down.  Think this stuff is wonderful, and the formula is a very rich gel cream that is highly emollient.  My skin is very dry, so I&#x27;m not advocating use on the face for all because after this is labeled as a body creme.  But I&#x27;ve been ignoring labels for years and have found that creams for the hands or body are just as good for the face and best of all they are far more economical.  You get more cream/lotion for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used the original Eucerin creme as a kid when I had eczema.  That cream was soothing but it was extremely thick and hard to distribute.  In fact it was more like a paste.  Eucerin has stepped up its game with this new line of products.  Note this cream is dye, fragrance and steroids free.  That&#x27;s good but must admit I did find this to be slightly irritating upon initial application.  Like to apply this mixed with olive oil, which has excellent anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
    <li> Takes away itch on my arms.</li>
    <li> Im a severe eczema suffer I tried this and it did not help at all honestly my skin is still flaring and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do.</li>
    <li> wonderful product. The first one that actually calms down itchy skin due to Eczema.&lt;br /&gt;And believe me...&lt;br /&gt;We have tried many creams and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;This one was highly recommended by our dermotologist and we had some samples from her first and loved it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price beats the Walmart price.</li>
    <li> I have serious bouts of eczema and recently purchased this. It feels like it does a very good job keeping the skin protected/moisturized and feels kind of water resistant as well. Before this I had a Gold Bond eczema relief lotion that was not as good as this product.  In comparison, it also feels like I need less to cover up more space.  The Eucerin is more expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for a friend after seeing it demonstrated on the Dr. Oz show. My friend loves the soothing comfort this cream gives him combating a rare and unknown skin condition. He stops his itching with a Cortaid product but says this cream is great for after getting out of the shower. He says that the Eucerin keeps his skin from drying out and \\&quot;puckering\\&quot; after washing and stays with him, keeping his skin moist for a long time. He LOVES how it makes him feel. Any product that can alleviate the suffering this poor guy has endured fighting this nasty skin condition has my sincere and enthusiastic endorsement.</li>
    <li> I have eczema on my eyelids and my skin is extremely dry, cracked and itchy. This creme doesn&#x27;t help at all with the severe itching and dryness.</li>
    <li> So far the cream has worked as advertized.  I&#x27;ll probably buy it again if improvement to my skin continues to improved. . .</li>
    <li> I have horrible dry skin on my calves in winter. It itches like poison ivy. This calms my skin and takes away the rash. It is thick and greasy, so it must be applied soon after leaving the shower or it is bad for getting dressed. But when I remember to use it, I have a much nicer day in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have used that is comparable is Gold Bond.  GB is extremely good, but this works a bit better.</li>
    <li> Feels great going on - if you like thick&lt;br /&gt;noticed my hands were getting wrinkles - the good products I use at night couldnt get to my skin to work - this stuff is a barrier - now that cant be good for ezema...smothering, no air</li>
    <li> I have tried NUMEROUS creams/oils/lotions for my infants eczema (very severe case). This lotion has been a lifesaver for us. The cost on Amazon is about 4 dollars cheaper than what I find in the stores. I will continue to purchase this product for a long time to come!</li>
    <li> Great cream for my hands helps with dry skin from washing your hands all day I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> Helped with adult eczema</li>
    <li> My 21 month old daughter has really dry skin.  This keeps her moisturized throughout the day. No greasy residue. I love it!</li>
    <li> Even prescription didn&#x27;t help DH with his itchy, scaly, red and sore skin around his waist where his pants rub. He is a mechanic and overweight, and gets terrible rashes sometimes. He found this in a store and since it works better than what his doctor gave him, naturally the stores were all out of stock when he was halfway through the bottle (tube?). Now, he is a procrastinator and would wait until he runs out to get more, so I hit Amazon. I bought two, and will be getting more soon....he just finished his SECOND full bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing, if you use it at least once a day consistently.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this for myself so I cannot say how it helps with eczema but my hands are always irritated from over washing so I use this at night and they feel better and look better! The cream is a bit heavy so you have to rub it in and let it sink in for a few but it is worth it! Also its fragrance free. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream i tried lots of cream but this one is the one. SInce im from Canada we cannot get yet so needs to order from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have eczema this is the one belive me,</li>
    <li> My baby has a bad case of eczema and it drives us up the wall (started during the winter last year). I really wanted to avoid topical steroid use but I couldn&#x27;t. Then, I found this. I&#x27;m not going to say that I can totally avoid steroids because sometimes, she experiences really severe flares. However, I&#x27;m able to use less steroid creams and her skin stays softer and less irritated overall. I&#x27;ve had an amazing experience with this cream.</li>
    <li> Bought this by recommendation of my sons (4 and 9) dermatologist. Works well and I love that is on subscribe and save. We never run out. My only complaint is that the top always seems to break off. You can press it back on, but I prefer to be able to just flip it open and close. Not a deal breaker at all. It keeps his break outs at bay. But if he does get one, we use this in collaboration with his prescription cream.</li>
    <li> The best lotion for babies with eczema</li>
    <li> ...but great results.  The Eucerin brand is top quality for creams, and this version takes it to the next level.  Having been bothered for years with dry skin, this cream performs as well as RX versions, with much less cost and much less risk (NO steroids).  If you&#x27;re regular cream isnt hacking it, this is def. worth a try.</li>
    <li> Our daughter has quite an eczema problem and so was glad to try this product. She says it&#x27;s quite easy to use and quite economical. It gives her \\&quot;some\\&quot; relief, about what she gets from other, similar non-prescription products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s the real issue. This product is good if you don&#x27;t have a very significant or serious eczema problem. It will deal with minor flare-ups and the like. But for anything more, what you can get in a non-prescription cream is only going to go so far. You will (as you already know) have to deal with doctors and prescription medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The limited relief that this cream offers isn&#x27;t, in a way, the fault of the product, because the manufacturer can only do so much within the limits of non-prescription strength remedies. But I do rate the product 4 stars instead of 5, not because it isn&#x27;t good within the limits that can&#x27;t be avoided, but because it&#x27;s over-hyped.</li>
    <li> Most lubricant lotions help to minimize the discomfort of eczema, but do not delay the onset of flare-ups or resist the worsening of flare-ups once they are underway.  For my version of eczema, this product is the best of the three products of its kind I have tried that both delay and minimize the intensity of flare-ups.</li>
    <li> As someone who has been dealing with cracked skin around both of my thumbs and forefingers I am always trying new creams and lotions.  So far the Eucerin is doing a good job of keeping my hands from drying out and cracking any further.  By applying it 3-4 times a day I am hoping it will also start to heal the existing cracks.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I have itchy skin and this is pretty good and preventing my skin from becoming irritated and I&#x27;ve tried a a lot of products.  I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Love it. Bit pricey but works well.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I had hoped for. Takes only a little of the irritations. irritates in the long run - unfortunately,</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m not a Vine Customer reviewer or a Eucerin employee or anything like that. I live in Raleigh and have an 18mo old son who is a wheezer and suffers from eczema (I guess the two go hand in hand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing was working well for him he had eczema mostly over his belly and back, and at the nape of his neck, but it was spreading to his legs too ... After 2 days of applying this stuff head to toe, the eczema vanished, he stopped itching til he bled, and his skin is back to how it was when he was first born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously amazed and plan to bathe in it myself. Maybe it will make me look 10 years younger or something.</li>
    <li> I do not have eczema, but I have had annoying keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and upper thighs for my whole life.  I&#x27;ve bought very expensive KP creams from Sephora and other places that cost more than five times this product and do not work even half as well.  After three weeks my KP was 95 percent gone.  It&#x27;s a little thick so it can be greasy after application but eventually it fully absorbs.  I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> The only cream that I have had any sort of success with for the eczema on my hands, wish it was sold in Canada</li>
    <li> Quality lotion, treats Eczema very well.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried several different kinds of eczema creams including California Baby, BabyGanics, and this is our favorite. It&#x27;s a bit thicker than the others, so it stays on for longer and keeps the moisture locked in. With consistent twice per day applications (even despite daily baths in the summer), my baby&#x27;s bad eczema went away in a few weeks. No more red blotches. Thank you, Eucerin! This item is on my monthly subscription list.</li>
    <li> Good cream, but do not overestimate it&#x27;s power: it works similar to regular Aveeno Eczema cream or many others, but no way can really &amp;#34;get read of eczema&amp;#34;. We are using it for our son, but almost no effect - still have to use corticosteroid cream prescribed by doctor to remove the etching and inflammation. I do like this cream  -again -  this is regular moisturizing cream, large tube, easy to wash away after applying, nice texture, I just do  not take seriously comments about this cream resolving eczema..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Lid gets easy broken. 3 of 4 tubes had this issue. Better lid design would be nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the positive reviews because I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product. Eucerin Intensive and Professional Repair have been so great for my eczema, but I thought I&#x27;d try this because it&#x27;s specifically designed for eczema.  For me, it feels like any other lotion. Maybe because it doesn&#x27;t absorb well. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle but I&#x27;m never buying again. I&#x27;m going back to Eucerin&#x27;s repair line.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I don&#x27;t have eczema but it works great on my extremely dry skin. It&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> First winter without itching. Used all the other Eucerin cremes, this was a winter. Sorry to see it disappear from the shelves of stores. Had to resort to ordering it, which cost a bit extra, but so glad I have enough to get through the winter. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought and tried about 8 different brands of eczema medicine, and one that worked really well was the one with steroids, of course that cleared everything up right away but had other effects too, it was really for my bad/cold cough. So it was a prescription-only item that I could only get at that time, so I have always been on the lookout for the same type of medicine to clear up my skin as of course, when I stopped taking the meds, the bad rash/dry skin of eczema came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin is the most recent I&#x27;ve tried and am still using, and it&#x27;s going well so far! The lotion comes in a large 8ounce easy to squeeze tube with a secure snap-cap attached to the tube. It is a white cream but spreads out and disappears, leaving no residue. And best is NO smell so others cannot tell you have special medicine/lotion on, and it won&#x27;t affect you wearing other lotions or perfume etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks, once in the morning and once at night, so through most of the day, my skin is pretty moisturized and not-dry. I would advise carrying a small bottle in your purse/etc just in case though. I also use a bit of oil over my Eucerin application, just to keep my skin and the lotion on my skin and protected from rubbing against clothing etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eucerin Body Creme is steroid-free, so no weird affects or allergies. Also, contains an effective ingredient against eczema - oatmeal, and also has licochalcone and ceramides - which all work together well and provide a good eczema relief. It only prevents the symptoms from getting worse, as there is no cure for eczema. Overall, definitely recommend and I&#x27;m glad to have discovered it. So far effective and not expensive, and no prescription needed. Wish it did more, but so far really great for relieving against itching and scratching eczema symptoms.</li>
    <li> My son suffers from seasonal mild eczema.  We have used Eucerin products (especially the tubs of Original Moisturing Creme, and the tubes of Calming Creme) in the past to treat it, and have come to rely on this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Eczema Relief Body Creme is also working well for us.  It is a very rich, thick lotion, which is easier to apply than the ointment-like Original Moisturizing Creme).  My son says it feels soothing on his broken, rashy skin.  He does not complain of stinging or burning like he with some products.  His skin looks healthier within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like this product for myself, for extreme dry skin.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly, so I save it for nighttime use.</li>
    <li> About a year ago, I developed horrible eczema on both of my calves, spreading from the ankle up to the knees. It is scaly, dry, unsightly, and most of all ITCHY. Despite using topical steroids, I haven&#x27;t found very much relief, and would sometimes wake up in the morning to find that I had been scratching all night, leaving my legs covered in scratches and sometimes bloody streaks. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I started using Eucerin, and what a difference! My legs are hydrated, and aren&#x27;t as itchy anymore thanks to the colloidal oatmeal in the creme. Because I&#x27;m not scratching as much, my scaly patches aren&#x27;t inflamed all the time, reducing the redness. I&#x27;m a much happier person since I started using this. Of course, using this OTC creme isn&#x27;t by any means a solution for eczema, but Eucerin is very soothing and really does help relieve a lot of symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as controlling the itchiness as well as [[ASIN:B003O7IBZC Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 7.3 Ounce]], though both contain the same active ingredient (colloidal oatmeal 1%). Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Eucerin is good, and very hydrating - but I find just a tiny bit more itch relief using Aveeno (though it is less moisturizing).</li>
    <li> My doc recommends this line.. and I have to tell you I can see why.  It is the best over the counter cream I can remember using.. affordable and lightweight but heavy enough to solve the issue.. NO smell and RELIEF from itch, dryness and being uncomforable.. it is a wonderful product, but I have never used anything in their line i didn&#x27;t love.</li>
    <li> Eucerin is a great product, it seemed to help ease the itch from my excema. It also seems to be mild on skin. The scent is also very clean.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work miracles. A miracle would be that the eczema disappears completely, without a trace. That didn&#x27;t happen with this creme, but I do LOVE the way it moisturizes my dry winter hands and it softens and relieves the itching of the seasonal eczema that shows up on the backs of my hands each winter.</li>
    <li> So rich and soothing for my eczema. I use this every day to moisturize my skin. I haven&#x27;t found any brand or product that I like as much as this cream. I&#x27;ve also tried the Aveeno&#x27;s version of Eczema Relief but it feels like the Daily Lotion so not nearly as effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been Eucerin products my entire life, and this Eucerin eczema creme is great for a family where everyone seems to have skin that gets irritated. It goes on easily and is scent free. The smooth creme spreads easily but doesn&#x27;t absorb great. But the good thing is that is provides relief to irritated skin. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Lather this on my elderly parent&#x27;s skin which is sensitive and thin.  Doesn&#x27;t absorb so much but less itchy and provides a good moisture barrier for more sensitive areas.</li>
    <li> I suggest you run (do not walk or stop for red lights) for this amazing cream.  I&#x27;ve had eczema for a billion years...but lately it&#x27;s gotten worse.  I started using this cream last week and within a few days there were incredible results.  Now I have no red spots which hurt because the skin had become so dry....no matter what cream I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who thinks it doesn&#x27;t absorb entirely, after a short time, I suggest you blot your skin with a towel for any cream that hasn&#x27;t absorbed.  I haven&#x27;t found that the cream transferred to my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought Eucerin Skin Calming Dry Skin Body Wash and only use a small bit when I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU Eucerin...I&#x27;m now no longer embarrassed to wear my blouses open at the neck anymore [This was a major eczema area of mine.]  Let alone - no more itchiness or hurting from my eczema spots (including elbows, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one has paid me to say this.  I&#x27;m just a satisfied user.  Worth every penny - without a trip to the dermatologist which is where I was headed.</li>
    <li> Excellent creme! It exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> This eczema cream works well. It is thick and goes on smooth without feeling oily. i didn&#x27;t like the smell of it but others I asked didn&#x27;t notice.</li>
    <li> Recommended by doctor to keep skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave it to me as a sample to try. My eczema was having a sever flare up. The cream worked. It controlled the itch and allowed my skin to heal. I hardly use any of the prescription steroid creme. if you have eczema use this.</li>
    <li> For Eczema around my husbands nose.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I suffer from eczema on my fingers. I work a job in which I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands, which inflames my eczema to the point that I have to wear finger cots constantly. After using several lotions, the last of which being Aveeno Eczema Lotion, I became hopelessly convinced that I would simply have to live with the dry, cracked, painful mess my fingers had become. When I saw this Eucerin, decided to give one more lotion a try. Unfairly judging it by its low price, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but after using it for three days, my fingers are almost completely back to normal! The day that I bought it, could barely bend the fingers on my right hand, now I can make a full fist without anything cracking open or hurting. I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with this product and I recommend it to anyone suffering from the misery of eczema!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent vendor</li>
    <li> I discovered this product on beautypedia.com.  I have eczema, and have been using cortisone cream on it when it flares up.  This winter, I had a persistent patch on the back of my right hand.  I was running low on cortisone cream, and called the doctor for a refill.  Without launching into a huge sob story, I made a bunch of phone calls, but my request got lost and the prescription didn&#x27;t get refilled, so the eczema persisted.  When I received this product and began using it, I saw a clear and marked reduction in the redness on my hand.  After less than a week of use, the hand looks normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am astonished that an over-the-counter product is so effective on my skin.  I have had a problem with red and scaly patches on my skin pretty much since I could walk, and I would have loved to have discovered this product decades ago.</li>
    <li> Non- irritating and smooth but the moisturizing effects wear off very quickly.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from eczema since I was a child. As an adult, it has greatly improved, that is, until I hit menopause. I recently had a strange rash above my lip and on the sides of my mouth. I changed toothpastes and stuck to my usual Cetaphil cream (which I love) and tried some cortisone creams. No help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this in the store and picked it up without checking out the online reviews first because I was so desperate. I used it around my mouth and within 3 days, the rash was gone!!! I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I have dry, dry skin and live in AZ. The cream is thick since it is afterall, a cream and not a lotion. But this is what I was looking for. Ahh, sweet relief!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I had a bad allergic reaction. I bought this after trying so many products that normally work for me. It worked well to calm the flare up down, but it did not help with my regular eczema.</li>
    <li> Wow, completely impressed.  I have eczema that annoyingly recurs quite often (in which I would always have to result to steroids to ease), but this is the only thing that works for me so far in alleviating the itch.  I tried really expensive cremes like Kiehl&#x27;s and other high-end ones, but this one works well for me.  Everyone is different, but I recommend this...</li>
    <li> I purchased this and Aveeno daily moisturing body wash that has colloidal oatmeal after seeing Dr. Oz. I got this for my 6 year old because she suffers from severe eczema all over her legs. She itched all the time so bad she would make herself bleed and she had bumps all over her legs. I have been using this for about 5 days now and her legs look normal and she doesn&#x27;t itch anymore. It looks like her eczema is gone. She sees a doctor every month who has prescribed many creams that didn&#x27;t work, told us to give her oatmeal baths which helped with the itching a little and prescribed oral medication. Her legs were so bad the doctor thought she might have scabies or that it was psychological. I love this. I had been using Aveeno eczema on her and it worked good at keeping her legs from itching and being really dry but it did not heal her eczema like this did. Also, I had to apply the Aveeno twice a day and this Eucerin only once a day and her skin would still look moisturized the next morning when I would reapply the Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My 6 year old had her visit with the doctor and he said her legs look great and he doesn&#x27;t need to see her for a year unless she has a flare up. Her legs look even better since I wrote this review. Her legs look so healthy. I apply it every morning and immediately after baths.</li>
    <li> This is MUCH cheaper than we found in local stores. Our 6mo old girl has eczema and we had purchased a smaller 3oz tube locally which was labeled &amp;#34;Instant Relief&amp;#34;. Looking at the cost of others with that label vs this, I figured I&#x27;d at least try this. When we got it, we scoped the ingredients out... it is EXACTLY the same thing as the ones labeled &amp;#34;Instant Relief&amp;#34; and it gives our girl the same relief. We usually put it on her twice a day (morning and bed time) unless we notice the eczema is bothering her. the 3oz tube we had previously lasted about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my dry skin. It really works.</li>
    <li> We tried for years to  find something that worked on my daughter&#x27;s skin. This has worked even better than the creams we paid four times as much for. We buy it monthly, and would suggest giving it a try!!! It doesn&#x27;t cause burning like some lotions do!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a body creme/ointment to relieve itching from Eczema.  I have tried 2 different ointments with very little success. I found Eucerin as one of the best for relieving itching from Eczema.  It is not easy to find in the stores in my area so I elected to let Amazon.com do the shopping for me.  It saves me time and gas money.  And being an older adult, it best to have your product delivered to your door than fighting traffic to go shopping.</li>
    <li> this stuff is pretty good. i have been using all kinds of lotions/creams, only that it is so expensive, loses a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the latest set of 3, is smaller, so it even more expensive...but it is great</li>
    <li> Extremely greasy cream. Has never helped my itchy skin.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how well and fast the s worked on my toddler&#x27;s excema.  He breaks out on his back, arm and leg crevesas and I rubed this on him for about 3 days at night and morning and it healed hiss&amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34; up.  I am very happy.</li>
    <li> Really works for my 18 month old.</li>
    <li> The only thing that has healed my 2 year olds eczema. The best product from the Eucerin line!</li>
    <li> My youngest son has suffered from eczema since he was about 6 months old - he&#x27;s now 3 1/2.  The spots would get so itchy that he&#x27;d make himself bleed from all the scratching.  We&#x27;ve tried many, many lotions, cremes, ointments, baths, etc.  This is by far the one that works the best for my son.  I apply it several times a day and make sure that my son goes to bed in footed pajamas to keep him from rubbing on the sheets or from scratching in the middle of the night.  Every time I reapply it, his legs still feel soft and hydrated from the last time I applied lotion.  Eucerin also makes a 2 oz Eczema Relief Instant Therapy Creme that I keep in my purse or a diaper bag and carry it with us.  It works to help stop the itching until we can get home and the smaller size is just perfect for on the go.  Both of the products will always be on hand.</li>
    <li> i like very very much..thanks</li>
    <li> Best stuff for my son&#x27;s dry skin.  His eczema is so much better than it used to be, but he still gets little patches on his feet and elbows.  Haven&#x27;t had to use cortisone cream in a while thankfully.  Highly recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product does work if one has eczema and wants relief from the itching.  My daughter has gotten prescriptions to relieve the itching but did not work.  I happen to be looking at the Doctor&#x27;s TV show and the topic was people who were having issues with itching from having eczema.  They suggested using this product to relieve the itching.  Since the prescription did not work I wanted to try this product and ordered it for my daughter who had been dealing with the itching for several months.  I guess it took less than a week for her to notice the difference, I noticed the deference sooner because the itching had drastically reduced.  This product is all she uses.</li>
    <li> People all over this country have itchy horses. I believe my horse&#x27;s itching was from eczema, and I tried EVERYTHING to give him some relief. He had rubbed out his mane, so the previous owner shaved it because it looked so ratty.  I was cruising the drug store, looking for SOMETHING! to help him, poor baby. Every day, I rubbed this on the itchy side of his neck, and into his mane roots, and on the other side. I rubbed it into the top 3-4 inches of his tail, and any place he was rubbing or biting. A little bit where he had flaky skin on his face, near the eyes. SUCCESS!!! The first time I saw him walking past his rubbing tree, i was so happy! His itchy spots on the side of his neck are gone, his mane has grown out about 6 inches. He is not rubbing his butt, well, just a little bit like any horse. No damage done, though. I now have this delivered from Amazon every month because the price is better. We are using less as the weather gets cooler, just a maintenance amount. Very happy with this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  I RECOMMEND IT!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing it on Dr Oz.  I wanted a really smooth lotion. Even though I do not have eczema, it makes your skin so smooth.  After my wife used it for the first time, I had to order another one because mine was taken.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and VERY dry cuticles. I purchased this hoping to soften my cuticles and it did not disappoint! It is the only brand that I find makes a vast improvement. The ingredients are so beneficial that I use it on my face at night as well. LOVE this product! Walmart has the best price at $10.97 for an 8oz tube. Target wanted $14.89! My 2nd choice is eucerin plus  dry skin intensive repair hand creme but it is more expensive per ounce. This product is so gentle that I used it on my face after doing a prescription peel for pre-cancer when my face was in the raw &amp; the scabbing stage and had no sensitivity issues at all. EXCELLENT PRODUCT. Hope they never change the formulation. Love the subscribe and save too!</li>
    <li> Very helpful for eczema, can be a little hard to rub in all the way but it is the only thing that helps my sons eczema.  Light scent, not greasy, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Eczema Relief Body Cr&amp;egrave;me is fragrance, dye and steroid free so it is safe for children as well as adults. The only solution the doctors have given for my child&#x27;s eczema is steroids and I just don&#x60;t feel comfortable using them unless I absolutely have to. This cream has no smell to annoy or irritate children and it is an added layer of protection to help prevent the often dry, irritated skin associated with eczema. It is a simple formula that contains oatmeal, licochalcone and ceramides. I find it a great alternative to treat the symptoms of and help prevent flare ups of eczema. It is so soothing that my other child who does not have eczema likes to use it on her legs and elbow too.</li>
    <li> Eczema Relief Body Creme by Eucerin is a good product.  Its texture is quite thick and a little bit goes a long way, so this 8 oz. tube will last for at least a year.  I noticed a slight tingling sensation upon application and it lists Colloidal Oatmeal 1% as the active ingredient, but I suspect this is due to the Ceramide-3 and/or Licochalcone.  It claims to be steroid-free and it is unscented, something I really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One improvement I&#x27;ve noticed is that it relieves itchy skin.  However, it contains mineral oil and that may be problematic for some users.  Also, Eucerin doesn&#x27;t claim that this cream is non-comedogenic, so apply sparingly and only in places where clogging isn&#x27;t a potential issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found this cream effective, though oily and heavy.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to relieve itchy, flaky skin and the relief is long-lasting.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a moisturizer per se, but as a supplement for problem skin, particularly re. eczema or other related issues where topical treatment is desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I use Aveeno&#x27;s eczema creme to help alleviate eczema on my hands that happens because of lots of dish washing at work.  Compared to the Aveeno creme, this one is definitely oilier--it stays a bit greasy after application.  It does work about as well as the Aveeno, but because of the oiliness I can&#x27;t really use it any time except for before I go to bed, so I&#x27;ll probably stick with the Aveeno as my go-to.</li>
    <li> My son has very bad eczema. I was using the Aveeno brand on him for awhile but he had a very bad outbreak and it wasn&#x27;t helping at all. I tried this and it started working the next day. I also like the feel of this lotion better.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This &#x27;lotion&#x27; works very well on my dry and itchy skin.  It absorbs very rapidly and has next to no odor.  Gets rid of redness in about a day.  It&#x27;s not greasy feeling like some can be.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My 6 year old son has very sensitive skin that gets big dry patches on his back, arms and buttocks in the winter or if he reacts to detergents on his clothes.  We were using Aveeno for Eczema and liked it a lot, but I wanted to see if this might also be a good reliever.  I noticed since using this, he isn&#x27;t itching and the patches seem to go away and stay away.  Its only the beginning of the winter here, but his skin has never been in better shape since we started using the Eucerin after his bath/shower. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Dr. Oz.  I suffered from severe itching due to pregnancy.  It was extremely difficult to sleep and to concentrate at work due to the itching.  Since first use of this product (mixed with baby oil gel), the itching is gone!  It is very thick, however this is not a problem for me due to having very dry skin.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is having itchy skin due to minor skin ailments.</li>
    <li> I have tried MANY products on my daughters eczema and Eucerin Eczema Relief is the only thing that has worked :-] luv luv luv this product!!!!</li>
    <li> best creme ever my baby boy had a little bit of eczema on his chest he scratch a lot almost to the point he bleed,he also had really dry rough skin on his arms and legs,baby lotion irritated more his skin and aquaphor ointment only work for minutes,eucerin body creme eczema relief its the best my baby skin it so soft doesn&#x27;t scratch no more and he has a beautiful baby skin i recommend for any one.5 stars the best creme ever</li>
    <li> I used to be the kid covered in a rash that your mom wouldn&#x27;t want you to get near.  I mostly grew out of my eczema but still get it every winter on my hands and legs...  Until I found this!  No steroids, no fragrance, no stinging!  This cream is soothing, rich, and easily absorbed.  It helped clear up a nasty patch of eczema on my hands that had been plaguing me since November in just a week!</li>
    <li> So good for the skin. Tried it because Dr. Oz recommended. Best lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> NEVER USED EUCERIN PRODUCTS BUT SAW IT ON DR. OZ FOR DRY SKIN. THE VERY FIRST TIME I USED IT AFTER  MY SHOWER MY LEGS STAYED MOISTURIZED. I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO USE IT EVERYDAY AS IT HAS GREAT STAYING POWER. WILL PURCHASE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Softens skin noticeably and clears up my excema (stops the itching.)</li>
    <li> This lotion works really well for my super dry skin.  If I use it regularly (once a day), I don&#x27;t have any of the dry skin problems I had before I used this lotion.  I buy 2 of these every month from Amazon subscribe and save.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great and eczema and dry itchy skin.</li>
    <li> This does not have hydrocortisone, which is why I bought it.  I have eczema and got addicted to topical steroids so now I avoid them.  I apply this as often as I need, and it helps my eczema.  It&#x27;s fragrance free, with no taste (I get eczema on my lips and face mostly).  It does not cause me to break out.</li>
    <li> I like this form of Eucerin creme.  I mix the Eucerin with a couple of other products for my husband&#x27;s dry skin.  The jar version is great but this tube mixes so much easier.  I will always keep a jar around, but now I am adding this tube to the mix, too.</li>
    <li> I moved to Denver and got this weird dry knee problem.  I put oceans of &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; lotion on my knees every day for 2 months with no results. After two applications of this lotion, it&#x27;s cleared up.  Glad I got it!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t notice a difference</li>
    <li> great item, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Works pretty good on my eczema.</li>
    <li> This was a last ditch effort to control the itch of my eczema--and it works. Especially a night, I have an issue with itching but this Eucerin Eczema Creme can keep the itch away and sooth dry skin better than other lotions and topicals that I have tried (and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot). Other people say that it&#x27;s oily, but I don&#x27;t really feel so since my normal body lotion is Eucerin&#x27;s Intensive Repair lotion which is much more oily than this one. Definitely worth the buy--I love this product!</li>
    <li> After years of suffering from the horrible itch this cream has provided more relief then anything I have tried. Works so well I can apply it just once I the morning  and still itch free at the end of the day. I am so glad to have found this product.</li>
    <li> I lOve this cream. it helps relieve my irritated stressed out skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am very allergic to all things and this is a great cream. I like that it does NOT contain sulfur or Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylprednisolone. YAY! This is a safe haven for my skin. A lot of other eucerin original creams had these preservatives and corticosteroid. and they are both skin irritants that trigger my ezcema&amp;dermatitis so it was a contradiction.&lt;br /&gt;This is worth the price and i highly recommend it. I also lOve that it is fragrance,dye and steroid Free.</li>
    <li> My story: this past summer I had a bug bite on my lower calf that caused me lots of problems, from excessive swelling to unbelievable itching to eventual infection. Once the infection cleared up, the swelling went down but the initial &amp;#34;bite spot&amp;#34; never quite healed and kept a scab. All of this caused a reaction that caused unbelievable itching and scaling. I tried several OTC things, then went to the Dr. She scratched her head and suggested Eucerin Eczema Relief. It worked! Itching, scaling and craziness stopped. Good stuff - goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed. No sting, so smell, no left over greasiness. Leg is almost back to normal.</li>
    <li> After using this cream for only one week, my eczema was completely cleared up.</li>
    <li> I have spent since June trying to heal the backs of my hands.  They were raw and bleeding all the time.  The itching was terrible.  I used steroid creams, all kinds of eczema creams and lotions, natural gels and nothing helped.  I read the reviews of the Eucerin Body Creme, Eczema Relief and decided to try it.  In less than one week, my hands have healed, almost completely.  The cracks and fissures are gone, the redness is almost gone, the dryness is almost gone.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it - after all that time.  It is a very thick cream, and rather oily, so you do have to get used to the feel.  But it lasts, and it works.  If you have ezcema, and you need help, this is the cream to buy.  Thank you, Eucerin...</li>
    <li> My dermatologist tried several prescription creams that didn&#x27;t work and then suggested I try this. It works.</li>
    <li> This calmed my red and white flakey skin down within a couple days. I used almost every lotion on the market to find I was allergic to most, including my allergic reaction to alveeno. This is gentle enough to not cause a reaction. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I do think it&#x27;s a little thick and I can see why some think it feels greasy, but it does the job and stops the itchy and eczema skin. I&#x27;m not as embarrassed to be in public anymore.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Quick delivery. This is the only lotion I can use with my eczema. Works great!</li>
    <li> I like this product, its not greasy and works very well.</li>
