### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and i feel very happy because I find a way to solve his teeth problem.</li>
      <li>Anyway my son is very happy with it</li>
      <li>It is a very good product.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>toothbrush is great apart from that.</li>
      <li>It was great for about a week</li>
      <li>great..</li>
      <li>I like that it has a closing cap (great for travel).&lt;br</li>
      <li>Panasonic toothbrush was a great hit.</li>
      <li>The side of the brush head and the weight of the brush are good for my 2</li>
      <li>In the end we all decided this was a good brush for a kid.</li>
      <li>The vibrations are just a gimmick, because if you want good electric brush you need a sonic one.</li>
      <li>It did a good job at cleaning his teeth and the battery-operated power was a lot nicer than the spin brushes that you buy in the store for kids these days.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m happy because he loves to brush teeth even more.</li>
      <li>When aiding the kids in brushing it&#x27;s a very nice feature to be able to see</li>
      <li>Or, they need to make them better!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy I had a chance to try this brush for free.</li>
      <li>I think he liked the vibrating nature of the toothbrush.</li>
      <li>If you want to spend this kind of money for a kids&#x27; toothbrush, look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>My daughter just started brushing her teeth and is surprisingly enthusiastic about it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There wasn&#x27;t much we liked about the brush -</li>
      <li>-in-all, the Panasonic EW-DS32-A Compact Battery-Operated Toothbrush is a nice addition to teeth-brushing for children.</li>
      <li>He loved the light up portion of it although you can turn it off if it becomes too distracting.</li>
      <li>The vibration makes it more attractive for kids and makes them more excited about brushing their teeth.</li>
      <li>and she&#x27;s very comfortable using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>like to see more color/style options.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This toothbrush is a cute idea</li>
      <li>Using the Panasonic, given that they have to be replaced more often, the price tag comes to about $120!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The toothbrush head can be removed and replaced, which I love.</li>
      <li>Kids love to brush their teeth,</li>
      <li>It does require a more manual style of brushing, but my kids go to town on that aspect anyway.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;-Very cute.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think Panasonic could have done better.</li>
      <li>However, he was very excited to use it.  </li>
      <li>I plan on replacing it in the next month or so, when I can get a good quality one for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My four year old nephew was happy to give this Panasonic Compact Battery-Operated Toothbrush</li>
      <li>In fact, he thought it was kind of cool and became excited to brush his teeth at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If it does not use the battery, can charge the words, then the more environmentally friendly.</li>
      <li>Easy to take to grandmas.&lt;br /&gt;-Lights</li>
      <li>I also have a concern about easy availability of replacement heads</li>
      <li>A combination lock so its not to easy to take a part?  </li>
      <li>for performance, the toothbrush runs on one AAA battery (which is ridiculously easy to install).</li>
      <li>At the end we still have to brush his teeth for his own good and smaller dentist bills;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall a good toothbrush but would be best suited for 3 and younger in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think we are all happy with this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>He loves the light.</li>
      <li>LED light helps parents/kids see built up plaque and brush them off.  </li>
      <li>B003IP6238 Spinbrush For Kids Battery Powered Toothbrush, Thomas The Train]] just requires holding it over each section of teeth lightly and it does all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Priced</li>
      <li>Also works with the LED light off.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;Replaceable</li>
      <li>The size is easy to handle and the vibrations make cleaning her teeth easy and fun.  </li>
      <li>This works best as a first electric toothbrush for toddlers - even though the manufacturer&#x27;s description says from age 3 up, it works for age 2+ as well so long as they are adequately supervised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since I use an electric toothbrush, I was hoping to get them excited about their toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>the voice is low and the light is good</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s easy for him to hold and grip, and he said it was \\&quot;more fun\\&quot; than a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My three-year old son is actually pretty good about brushing (and letting us brush)</li>
      <li>We look forward to when she&#x27;ll be able to use the Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush because it&#x27;s way more sturdy and the heads are both 3x more durable and even less</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame, especially since I love SO MANY of their products.</li>
      <li>Yes, my son likes his new tooth brush and does a better job of brushing his teeth with it, but he also quickly disassembles it and has the batteries out.  </li>
      <li>Almost any new toothbrush has this effect, and these adorable bunny versions were no exception.  </li>
      <li>The little light lets me see into their mouth and help out and get a good view of what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey for what it is, and the ease of replacing the battery may be of concern to some parents, but it works well and brought a smile to my daughters face (while increasing the time she spends brushing).</li>
      <li>2 year old son is pretty good in brushing teeth, but we got to the point where he wants to do it and it takes literally 15 minutes for the whole routine.</li>
      <li>This is a great little first toothbrush in a lot of ways.</li>
      <li>And the fact that he was EXCITED to brush his teeth was what really sold the product for me.</li>
      <li>When I received the toothbrushes I felt delighted because they like me very much, they were as I expected.</li>
      <li>The sonic vibration is effective but not overpowering, much gentler than with Sonicare, and in my opinion, just right for getting little ones used to a sonic toothbrush without overwhelming them.</li>
      <li>When I saw the Panasonic EW-DS32-A Compact Battery-Operated Toothbrush, I thought it might make a fun addition to her brushing, and it largely has.</li>
      <li>This was unfortunately not one of them.</li>
      <li>The novelty of have an electric brush \\&quot;like mommy&#x27;s\\&quot; makes them more agreeable to having their teeth brushed</li>
      <li>/&gt;They have had more disposable type brushes in the past (spin brush comes to mind), but these Panasonic are lighter, more compact and quieter versions of a kid&#x27;s electronic toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Panasonic brush heads cost more than $10 apiece the last time I checked.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if this brush gets more gunk off my kid&#x27;s teeth, but I can say that his teeth looked white and shiny after using it.</li>
      <li>Not only were the vibrations much too strong for her, but the brush head was too large to effectively brush the sides of teeth in the back of her tiny mouth, and we soon found ourselves back to using her manual brush more often than not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic&#x27;s battery toothbrush for children is a great first-time electric toothbrush for little ones.</li>

      <li>The brush runs on a single AAA battery and the vibrations are quite gentle, perfect for a small child.</li>
      <li>one thing I definitely don&#x27;t like about this toothbrush is that it&#x27;s missing a timed auto off feature, which is pretty important for kids learning to brush on their own.</li>
      <li>This tooth brush should really be labeled for Toddlers.  </li>
      <li>She can get the battery covers off of remote controls and things of that nature, and this is easier than most of those.</li>
      <li>The built-in light seems like a nice touch, but it&#x27;s kind of useless for her (other than for doubling as a single-LED flashlight).</li>
      <li>Most major brands have heads that can last up to three months.  </li>
      <li>Dentists recommend using electric toothbrushes due to the ease of use and and more thorough cleaning of teeth.  </li>
      <li>is that the battery compartment seems far too easy to open.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, however, I think it&#x27;s a wonderful first sonic toothbrush, and definitely recommend it for little ones not yet big enough for a Sonicare for Kids.</li>
      <li>The tiny light works decently for seeing to brush back teeth if your bathroom isn&#x27;t lighted well enough, and I also love the cap, which keeps the brush clean whether traveling or at home, and the fact that it runs on a single AAA battery for months at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The second time, the color is better than the red before.</li>
      <li>high @$32.98 and $21.99 for (2) replacement brush heads (at time of review).&lt;br /&gt;&gt;No AAA battery included (we just use our rechargeable batteries).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think $30 for that is way to high.</li>
      <li>(A little too cute for the boy who was hoping for one of his characters.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While it was great that our little girl finally stopped fighting us about brushing her teeth, the final cost is hefty.  </li>
      <li>there is one big flaw -- the battery compartment comes open far too easily.</li>
      <li>head is just too small for most</li>
      <li>First off, the head of the brush is TINY.</li>
      <li>The kids find it a little too easy to take apart and play with the battery</li>
      <li>The brush is lightweight and easy to start for little hands.</li>
      <li>brush head only vibrates (12,000 times per minute) and requires a bit more active brushing movements by parents/kids.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great little first toothbrush in a lot of ways. The vibration makes it more attractive for kids and makes them more excited about brushing their teeth. That&#x27;s a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is one big flaw -- the battery compartment comes open far too easily. My son loves taking this toothbrush apart. I&#x27;d rather he didn&#x27;t -- I don&#x27;t like him playing with batteries or breaking electronic equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is great apart from that. Its tiny head mean this is best for very young children, it might be too small even for a five year old or so. Recommended for toddlers, especially if they are putting up resistance to brushing.</li>
    <li> The second time, the color is better than the red before. Kids love to brush their teeth, great.. If it does not use the battery, can charge the words, then the more environmentally friendly.</li>
    <li> When I received the toothbrushes I felt delighted because they like me very much, they were as I expected. It is a very good product. So, I recomend not only for kids but also for adults as well.</li>
    <li> the voice is low and the light is good</li>
    <li> Dentists recommend using electric toothbrushes due to the ease of use and and more thorough cleaning of teeth.

    <li> I tried using the electric toothbrush with Jonah who is a three year old boy. He loved the light up portion of it although you can turn it off if it becomes too distracting. It seemed easier for me to help him brush his teeth than for him to do it himself compared to a conventional toothbrush. I think he liked the vibrating nature of the toothbrush. The small brush of the design had me a little worried at first but it seems to work well. I would fully recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a cute idea and I purchased one for each kid. I had hoped the electric toothbrush would do a lot of the work during the limited time my 2 year old will allow me to brush his teeth. It was great for about a week but then both brushes lost their buzz buzz buzz and now they both function as a regular toothbrush with lights. There is a tiny zzzz but no power...and yes I changed the batteries. Cant&#x27; believe I spent almost $30 on kids toothbrushes that don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute,my baby takes it as a toy and i feel very happy because I find a way to solve his teeth problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush as a gift for my ten-yr old daughter and she loves it.  The size is easy to handle and the vibrations make cleaning her teeth easy and fun.  I no longer have to worry about her brushing well, as the vibrations increase the cleaning power without being too powerful for small mouths.  She enjoys brushing now, and never complains!</li>
    <li> Several years ago, my dentist noticed that my children weren&#x27;t brushing well enough and recommended we buy Sonicare for Kids electric toothbrushes. Though my son took to the powerful Sonicare right away, my 3 year-old daughter hated it. Not only were the vibrations much too strong for her, but the brush head was too large to effectively brush the sides of teeth in the back of her tiny mouth, and we soon found ourselves back to using her manual brush more often than not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic&#x27;s battery toothbrush for children is a great first-time electric toothbrush for little ones. It has a very small brush head, which makes getting down to brush the sides of the back teeth so much easier than with Sonicare or those chunky disposable kids electric toothbrushes. The sonic vibration is effective but not overpowering, much gentler than with Sonicare, and in my opinion, just right for getting little ones used to a sonic toothbrush without overwhelming them. The tiny light works decently for seeing to brush back teeth if your bathroom isn&#x27;t lighted well enough, and I also love the cap, which keeps the brush clean whether traveling or at home, and the fact that it runs on a single AAA battery for months at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I definitely don&#x27;t like about this toothbrush is that it&#x27;s missing a timed auto off feature, which is pretty important for kids learning to brush on their own. Otherwise, however, I think it&#x27;s a wonderful first sonic toothbrush, and definitely recommend it for little ones not yet big enough for a Sonicare for Kids.</li>
    <li> My daughter just started brushing her teeth and is surprisingly enthusiastic about it. When I saw the Panasonic EW-DS32-A Compact Battery-Operated Toothbrush, I thought it might make a fun addition to her brushing, and it largely has. The brush runs on a single AAA battery and the vibrations are quite gentle, perfect for a small child. The built-in light seems like a nice touch, but it&#x27;s kind of useless for her (other than for doubling as a single-LED flashlight). I&#x27;m not sure if it actually is getting the teeth any cleaner (probably does in the spots between teeth), but I can say that she spends more time with it, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is that the battery compartment seems far too easy to open. She can get the battery covers off of remote controls and things of that nature, and this is easier than most of those. Teeth-brushing time is still a monitored event, so that&#x27;s not a huge concern for me, but it should be mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, the Panasonic EW-DS32-A Compact Battery-Operated Toothbrush is a nice addition to teeth-brushing for children. It&#x27;s a bit pricey for what it is, and the ease of replacing the battery may be of concern to some parents, but it works well and brought a smile to my daughters face (while increasing the time she spends brushing).</li>
    <li> This works best as a first electric toothbrush for toddlers - even though the manufacturer&#x27;s description says from age 3 up, it works for age 2+ as well so long as they are adequately supervised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;1. The side of the brush head and the weight of the brush are good for my 2+ year olds.&lt;br /&gt;2. The novelty of have an electric brush \\&quot;like mommy&#x27;s\\&quot; makes them more agreeable to having their teeth brushed&lt;br /&gt;3. With this, there&#x27;s a lot more actual brushing and less chewing of the bristles&lt;br /&gt;4. The little light lets me see into their mouth and help out and get a good view of what I&#x27;m doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t see myself using it continously at the present price; hence the 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;2. I also have a concern about easy availability of replacement heads&lt;br /&gt;3. The kids find it a little too easy to take apart and play with the battery</li>
    <li> My headline pretty much sums it up.  We have a very small 5 year old who had some difficulty using the Sonicare brush for kids which has a bigger head and vibrates more.  This brush did the trick and she&#x27;s very comfortable using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, this brush is expensive for what it is.  It&#x27;s not so much that the brush itself costs a lot, but that the toothbrush head wears out FAST and replacements are expensive.  Most major brands have heads that can last up to three months.  The head on this brush lasted less than four weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it was great that our little girl finally stopped fighting us about brushing her teeth, the final cost is hefty.  We look forward to when she&#x27;ll be able to use the Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush because it&#x27;s way more sturdy and the heads are both 3x more durable and even less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic brush heads cost more than $10 apiece the last time I checked.  Given how quick they wear out that price needs to drop to no more than $5 and maybe even less.  Or, they need to make them better!  Otherwise I&#x27;m not sure how this brush is any different than the throwaway battery brushes you can get at Target or Walmart.  Doing the math: In one year&#x27;s time the Sonicare heads cost no more than $40 a year.  Using the Panasonic, given that they have to be replaced more often, the price tag comes to about $120!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush does the job for small children.  They dropped the ball on the cost for consumers, however.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy I had a chance to try this brush for free. I think $30 for that is way to high. Does not come with the battery. I like that it has a closing cap (great for travel).&lt;br /&gt;My 2 year old son is pretty good in brushing teeth, but we got to the point where he wants to do it and it takes literally 15 minutes for the whole routine. At the end we still have to brush his teeth for his own good and smaller dentist bills;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic toothbrush was a great hit. He loves the light. The brush is lightweight and easy to start for little hands. The vibrations are just a gimmick, because if you want good electric brush you need a sonic one. Anyway my son is very happy with it and I&#x27;m happy because he loves to brush teeth even more.</li>
    <li> First off, the head of the brush is TINY. I think they meant \\&quot;for toddlers and preschoolers\\&quot; and not children. I have six-year-old son currently using this, and it&#x27;s awfully small for his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There wasn&#x27;t much we liked about the brush - it&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s easy for him to hold and grip, and he said it was \\&quot;more fun\\&quot; than a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t come with a battery. (Seriously?!) It needs an AAA battery.&lt;br /&gt;It just vibrates. Barely.&lt;br /&gt;It does auto shut-off after a while, but way too long. I was hoping it would auto shut-off after two minutes, so he always knows exactly how long he&#x27;s supposed to brush. Instead it&#x27;s 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The head is just too small for most children.&lt;br /&gt;For what it is, I think the price is outrageous. You can get one that does just this for less than half the price. If you want to spend this kind of money for a kids&#x27; toothbrush, look elsewhere. I plan on replacing it in the next month or so, when I can get a good quality one for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think Panasonic could have done better. It&#x27;s a shame, especially since I love SO MANY of their products. This was unfortunately not one of them.</li>
    <li> I got two of these brushes.  The blue for my four year old boy boy and the pink for my seven year old girl.  Since I use an electric toothbrush, I was hoping to get them excited about their toothbrushes.  Almost any new toothbrush has this effect, and these adorable bunny versions were no exception.  Here&#x27;s the pro and con list we came up with together:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very cute.  The cap is bunny has a rabbit&#x27;s head.  (A little too cute for the boy who was hoping for one of his characters.  He found the bunny blue babyish.  He&#x27;s four.)&lt;br /&gt;-Cap included with brush.  Easy to take to grandmas.&lt;br /&gt;-Lights Up (Mom loves this.  When aiding the kids in brushing it&#x27;s a very nice feature to be able to see the teeth).&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight &amp; small (Even the four year old can easily manage).&lt;br /&gt;-Quiet.  (My boy especially does not like a loud toothbrush).&lt;br /&gt;-The battery lasts.  We&#x27;ve been using these toothbrushes for a month now and the batteries are still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Battery was not included in the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;-Would like to see more color/style options.&lt;br /&gt;-More Expensive (this is really just an adult complaint.  I could by a lot of toothbrushes for the cost and maintenance of using these).&lt;br /&gt;-Only one speed.  The kids like options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have had more disposable type brushes in the past (spin brush comes to mind), but these Panasonic are lighter, more compact and quieter versions of a kid&#x27;s electronic toothbrush.  It does require a more manual style of brushing, but my kids go to town on that aspect anyway.  In the end we all decided this was a good brush for a kid.</li>
    <li> A combination lock so its not to easy to take a part?  Yes, my son likes his new tooth brush and does a better job of brushing his teeth with it, but he also quickly disassembles it and has the batteries out.  The light seems unimportant to me.  I&#x27;d rather it was harder to take apart.</li>
    <li> My three-year old son is actually pretty good about brushing (and letting us brush) his teeth. He is used to using a conventional toothbrush, but since he sees my husband and I using our Sonicare system everyday, I thought I would let him try this battery-operated toothbrush to see how things went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to discover that he wasn&#x27;t freaked out by the vibrations of this toothbrush at all. In fact, he thought it was kind of cool and became excited to brush his teeth at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, the toothbrush runs on one AAA battery (which is ridiculously easy to install). One battery lasts for about 60 days. The toothbrush head can be removed and replaced, which I love. I can&#x27;t really tell if this brush gets more gunk off my kid&#x27;s teeth, but I can say that his teeth looked white and shiny after using it. And the fact that he was EXCITED to brush his teeth was what really sold the product for me. Overall, I think we are all happy with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush should really be labeled for Toddlers.  I received the toothbrush to use on my 5 year old and the brush had is extremely tiny.  However, he was very excited to use it.  It did a good job at cleaning his teeth and the battery-operated power was a lot nicer than the spin brushes that you buy in the store for kids these days.  I also didn&#x27;t like the fact that it didn&#x27;t come with a battery - I just prefer products to come with batteries.  Overall a good toothbrush but would be best suited for 3 and younger in my opinion.</li>
