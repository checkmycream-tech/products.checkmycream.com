      <li>and I love the different speeds.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what that is like...</li>
      <li>Even though one person can use, it will definitely work better if you have someone else to help you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would probably work better on a  larger person rather than petite size person.</li>

      <li>With the long handle she is able to massage herself.</li>
      <li>This works exactly as described and was sent to me in a very timely manner.  </li>
      <li>A day or so after I placed my order, Amazon had the exact same item for $35.99 and free</li>
      <li>Not only is it streamline, but it also is strong.  </li>
      <li>This is so much easier to hold and use, and without the punishment you hand takes on the Oster.</li>
      <li>I just received my massager today and really like it.</li>
      <li>and this works really well.</li>
      <li>I am suffering with plantar fasciitis and it really helps work the kinks out.</li>
      <li>The product is of a very known brand Whal and it met our expectations.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Handle is long and unit light enough so I can reach my own back.</li>
      <li>Better than I imagined, based on previous muscle gadget&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>Would be nicer if the attachments were softer, as they were in the older</li>
      <li>on the high setting you need to hold it with too hand</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it if you can manage the weight, 3 pounds.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it very much, and I can tell it will last a long time.</li>
      <li>Powerful vibrator goes deep into muscles.</li>
      <li>Definitely recommend starting on the lightest setting and holding it lightly over the area until you get the feel of it.</li>
      <li>when it says deep-tissue it means deep tissue) but for the price I&#x27;m just not sure I&#x27;d pay that much money again to only get 4 months of good use out of it</li>
      <li>She noticed a big difference between the two sides since one was worked more than the other.</li>
      <li>With ongoing problems with soft tissue damage around my c-spine, I need something nearly every day.</li>
      <li>It really gives a deep massage.  </li>
      <li>A lot bigger than I thought, but very manageable.</li>
      <li>Handle is long enough for me to reach my lower back easily.</li>
      <li>The unit is Strong enough and the Cord is long enough.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I would say is if you have a target store near where you live I would buy in store.</li>
      <li>The chord is very long, and for the size-- this thing is pretty big!</li>
      <li>Beware of the various pricing offers however.</li>
      <li>We worked one side and started on the other, but couldn&#x27;t finish because we had to get dinner ready.</li>
      <li>We tried the different attachments and worked the lower back and hip area (do not put directly on the spine or bone).</li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s heavy, but its powerful and my back improved after two treatments.</li>
      <li>The long handle makes it easy to reach areas that are hard to reach.  </li>
      <li>This wahl is a little fast and if you hit a bone with any of the attachments included, it hurts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife suffers from chronic back pain due to muscle spasms. We tried the different attachments and worked the lower back and hip area (do not put directly on the spine or bone). The massager worked amazingly well. We worked one side and started on the other, but couldn&#x27;t finish because we had to get dinner ready. She noticed a big difference between the two sides since one was worked more than the other. We also noticed using the rounded and rounded with nubs attachments were good to work a general area, then using the pinpoint attachment to catch any specific areas.   It is a STRONG percussive massager. Even on the lightest setting it packs a good vibration. Definitely recommend starting on the lightest setting and holding it lightly over the area until you get the feel of it. It does have a hefty weight to it and it&#x27;s a bit bulky. You may need two hands for better control. Even though one person can use, it will definitely work better if you have someone else to help you.</li>
    <li> Beware of the various pricing offers however. A day or so after I placed my order, Amazon had the exact same item for $35.99 and free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be the best massager I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the $75 Oster massager with springs that hold the unit to your hand. No comparison. This is so much easier to hold and use, and without the punishment you hand takes on the Oster.</li>
    <li> Bought this to use on my frozen shoulder after physical therapy then I used a moist heat pad after my self massage.It was wonderful!</li>
    <li> i think it should be called the two handed vibrater. this thing shakes like a mofo. i thought the head was going to rotate or somthing all the head do the same thing pretty much just vibrate. on the high setting you need to hold it with too hand its heavy so holding it in the wrong position will piss you off i like the feeling after but i dont like how my hands get the workut</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how we lived without this thing before!  This is a WONDERFUL massager!  It relieves tension and muscle aches and I love the different speeds.  a little heavy to use yourself, better to have someone else use it on you. feels AMAZING. deep tissue perfection.</li>
    <li> My husband has back and leg pain and I bought this massager for him to use while he relaxes after a long day.  He used it just about every day for 4 months, but then the cord at the base of the massager frayed!  He loved this massager so much (when it says deep-tissue it means deep tissue) but for the price I&#x27;m just not sure I&#x27;d pay that much money again to only get 4 months of good use out of it (it only works now if you hold it in a very specific way and push the frayed cord back together with your thumb).  Then again, we&#x27;ve tried buying other massagers and he&#x27;s HATED them.  I think I will eventually buy this one again for him, but immediately wrap the cord from the base of the massager about 8 inches down in electrical tape and see if that will stop the cord from fraying and shocking the begezus out of us when we&#x27;re trying to use it.</li>
    <li> Percussion massage helps my plantar fasciitis, so I bought this as a gift for a relative with the same issue.  He thought this massager  was very effective.  But the cord broke within two weeks.  When I asked if he&#x27;d like me to send another, figuring it was just a fluke, he said yes ... if I found a different brand.  Now I see other reviewers have posted about cord malfunctions too.</li>
    <li> Great product. Is as advertised. Fast shipping. The only thing I would say is if you have a target store near where you live I would buy in store. That will save you some $</li>
    <li> This product paid for itself right away. Yes it&#x27;s heavy, but its powerful and my back improved after two treatments. You will love it!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife who loves it.  Gives a great massage.  Seems durable.  With the long handle she is able to massage herself.</li>
    <li> Love this massager!!!! Im in my 20&#x27;s and I developed back problems due to a car accident some time ago. Ive been to chiropractors and massage parlors for a while and since I will forever have this problem, I fiqured it would be less expensive to purchase a \\&quot;strong\\&quot; massager for home. Well I found it! This is great! No more getting my daughter to walk on my back.</li>
    <li> This works exactly as described and was sent to me in a very timely manner.  The different massage heads are a plus and it is easy to hit those sore muscles on my own back with this one!</li>
    <li> What a thumper! The massager is all that the mfgr said it is. On high speed , it really produces a great massage, on low speed, it thumps. I did not try to over- push to try to stall it. It probaly could be dragged down, but why?</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this powerful massager. I am suffering with plantar fasciitis and it really helps work the kinks out. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband who has back issues.  He loves it.  Not only is it streamline, but it also is strong.  It really gives a deep massage.  Love the attachments also.  I used it on my neck area and it was really wonderful. The long handle makes it easy to reach areas that are hard to reach.  Would recommend this massager to anyone.</li>
    <li> Powerful vibrator goes deep into muscles. Better than I imagined, based on previous muscle gadget&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> The product is of a very known brand Whal and it met our expectations. The previous massager I had was very soft and did not reach the muscles deep inside. This one does. The product is strong and doesn&#x27;t make noise.</li>
    <li> This wahl is a little fast and if you hit a bone with any of the attachments included, it hurts. Would be nicer if the attachments were softer, as they were in the older models.&lt;br /&gt;It is good for reaching your own shoulder and back area.&lt;br /&gt;Would probably work better on a  larger person rather than petite size person.</li>
    <li> I just received my massager today and really like it. I have a nerve injury in my leg and it really helps when I masaage up and down my leg and behind knee. It really helps my pain and also gives a great foot massage.</li>
    <li> The unit is Strong enough and the Cord is long enough.  Going on two months now and use almost every day.</li>
    <li> The Wahl deep-tissue massager is very good quality. My spouse has chronic shoulder pain and he is very pleased with the relief he gets from the pain with the deep tissue massage. He uses it every day. I would highly recommend it if you can manage the weight, 3 pounds.</li>
    <li> gr8 brand name, good massage, really good for back and face and neck. more difficult for close up because of length and contour of handle.</li>
    <li> Handle is long and unit light enough so I can reach my own back. The control is in a bad place and just the normal use can slide the control to change the speed while you are using it.  Otherwise would have given a 5.</li>
    <li> The changeable heads are very useful. I get a lot of back pain and this works really well. My only complaint would probably be the plastic casing. It feels durable enough, but it does feel like the plastic could break some times.</li>
    <li> Have you ever been to the chiropractor? (If so, Do you remember them putting this thing on your back before they put it back into place?) This is exactly what that is like... They really do mean deep tissue. It is wonderful. It shipped very quickly, and I know we can all appreciate that. The four different knobs are very unique and can be used anywhere you want them to be used. The chord is very long, and for the size-- this thing is pretty big! A lot bigger than I thought, but very manageable. It is actually long enough that you can massage yourself with it, but your hand may get tired after a while. Also, you can adjust the speeds... I think that it ranges perfectly from slow- to extremely fast.... I enjoy it very much, and I can tell it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Although it is lightweight, the hammers go deep into your tissue. Handle is long enough for me to reach my lower back easily.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a massager that would work deep enough for years. i have been using a panasonic panabrator (and continuing to get them on ebay) for many years. I bought massagers and returned them. They were useless. The one downside to my panabrator: I couldn&#x27;t get every area myself. This massager is better than anything I have ever tried. With ongoing problems with soft tissue damage around my c-spine, I need something nearly every day. This massager is designed for self use on ANY part of the body. I use it daily for foot and hand reflexology, a scalp and neck massage, and then a facial massage. I spend 43 minutes (the length of my favorite show) after work every day. Since I started, I feel great, have renewed energy, a positive spirit, and I lok fabulous. I am sleeping better than I have in years. Migraines, puffy eyes, sinus and IBD symptoms have disappeared. I don&#x27;t need to do it for that length of time ( I tend to love overkill), but it&#x27;s easy and it feels great. One could just do hand or foot massage with the same result. It is the most satisfying purchase of my life. I love it and plan to buy another in case they go out of production.</li>
