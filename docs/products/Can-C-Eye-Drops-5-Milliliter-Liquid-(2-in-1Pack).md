      <li>Wonderful product!</li>
      <li>Best of luck to you.</li>
      <li>I very good product and as always speedy delivery of order</li>
      <li>notice a great difference in dryness and night blindness</li>
      <li>and I was happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>Both have run the first 2 bottles (5ml each), the beagle cataract is almost unnoticable, she is catching the treats again!!!</li>
      <li>he decided just to try one eye on his own.  </li>
      <li>it at your own risk.  </li>
      <li>My dog use to love catching mini marshmallows and would never miss one.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>Can C may be okay for some people.</li>
      <li>As many people have indicated you may not see results for 5 or 6 months.</li>
      <li>Reputable Company I do recommend is Vision Clarity Eye Drops.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>Great product, it really works,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m seeing better and my dog&#x27;s eyes are clearing up as well.</li>
      <li>the best she has done is 3 of 10 but not constantly.</li>
      <li>Been using this product for a year and have better</li>
      <li>She was more playful and not bumping into things.</li>
      <li>I use it along with Dr. Schultze&#x27;s eyebright formula and it works pretty good.</li>
      <li>A pretty good study was done on this product which is summarized here:</li>
      <li>and he is excited!</li>
      <li>This seems to be working to make me more comfortable.  </li>
      <li>After a less than impressive eye exam, with both conditions threatening surgery, I ordered Can-C.</li>
      <li>this is super stuff!</li>
      <li>I noticed a huge improvement.</li>
      <li>I wish i would have started taking this sooner as it really seemed to accelerate my vision getting better.</li>
      <li>she doesnt hit herself any more, and she&#x27;s even confident to go outside the garden again!!</li>
      <li>It will probably work just as quickly.  </li>
      <li>My own eyes were bothering me recently</li>
      <li>so I can measure any success in the shrinkage and as of this six week assessment have seen no measurable success.</li>
      <li>Great product for dry eyes and early stage cataracts!</li>
      <li>In fact after 6 months my left eyes was actually better than my right.</li>
      <li>exactly what i wanted</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I can count the first box or not as I didn&#x27;t do it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;But….</li>
      <li>and I am definitely seeing better</li>
      <li>I will definitely be ordering more .</li>
      <li>not ALL of it, but enough for them to have a better quality of life.  </li>
      <li>We consistently gave her the drops hoping to see improvement in her vision.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a difference in my vision the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>There are a few good tips that I can pass on to those who want to give this a try:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wrote a positive review on the others.  </li>
      <li>I found I was able to see more clearly when I read the paper after being on the product for a few weeks.</li>
      <li>I did find that it solved my night time dry eye problem so ordered more.  </li>
      <li>She seems always to be able to detect light from darkness and to avoid large objects like couches and chairs but not able to see fingers in front of her face.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about the retina pigmentosa and don&#x27;t really think it will help with it, but you never know.  </li>
      <li>My vision in that eye was also getting very blurry.</li>
      <li>this stuff really worked for my two Chihuahuas.  </li>
      <li>Not helping much...</li>
      <li>we are very happy.&lt;br /&gt;About</li>
      <li>The literature that came with the boxes was not sufficient though as I did order more and got literature that told me about using one drop at a time and holding it into closed eyes for 30 seconds.  </li>
      <li>, now she is back in the game, catching the treats!!</li>
      <li>my older neighbor has retina pigmentosa and cataracts and asked me for help.</li>
      <li>I had no negative effects....</li>
      <li>Soon the half moon turned in to a full circle, or halo, whenever I looked through my left eye at a point of light.</li>
      <li>I took the 3rd drop right before bed</li>
      <li>so am hoping after a few months that I will be able to come back with a positive review concerning those results.</li>
      <li>I took it three times a day religiously for the first year.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I missed once in the entire first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the author of the study, the bio-physicist Dr Mark Babizhayev, has a connection with the manufacturer, Innovative Vision Products,</li>
      <li>I read all the testimonials, good and bad, including all that were posted here and decided it was well worth a try.</li>
      <li>within 2 weeks he can see golf balls and his eye is clear.</li>
      <li>before that, she would just let them drop, and the smell them till she found them, not catching them any more</li>
      <li>but it has brought back so much of their vision.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for 10 year old shihtzu who has cataracts and after two weeks I started seeing improvement.</li>
      <li>My cataract is completely gone</li>
      <li>We have been using CAN-C for 6 weeks on my 13 year old Rat Terrier</li>
      <li>so my eye would remain closed right after taking the drop where the constant normal blinking you do during the day wouldn&#x27;t wash it all away</li>
      <li>It can take that long but is well worth the effort when it finally kicks</li>
      <li>Over a year ago I began to notice a half moon appearing in my vision every time I looked through my left eye at a point source (dot) of light.</li>
      <li>and I was put on normal check back status.</li>
      <li>and my eye is back to normal.</li>
      <li>and my vision is completely back to normal.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product - I have very dry eyes (painful at times) and cataracts-</li>
      <li>I have not been using it long enough to see any real difference ( about 1.5 months so far) so far</li>
      <li>I figured I had little to lose, and if it helped, it was worth the trial.</li>
      <li>needless to say he is very excited!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;  the cloudiness is disappearing and Sight in general is improving,</li>
      <li>I continue to use the drops, hoping the threatened surgeries will remain far in the future.</li>
      <li>I bought these, because my vet told me my 9 year old beagle had starting developing cataracts.</li>
      <li>but, if can-c gives him even a few months of eyesight it is worth it</li>
      <li>Had developed a cataract in one eye and used a different product to keep it at bay for several years.</li>
      <li>the french poodle, her left eye is starting to clearly improve!</li>
      <li>It takes a long while to clear up you eyes with Can&#x3D;See.  </li>
      <li>I gave this product full stars, as it has actually dept my secondary cataracts on hold, and, I  feel, kept my macular degeneration on hold.</li>
      <li>I have used this on several elderly dogs in the past with very positive results.  </li>
      <li>decided that even they are expensive, I read very cheerfully reviews, so I have them a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for cataracts</li>
    <li> I have used this on several elderly dogs in the past with very positive results.  My own eyes were bothering me recently so I thought I&#x60;d give it a try.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for dog catarats</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product - I have very dry eyes (painful at times) and cataracts-I&#x27;ve just been using these for a few days-and find them to be very soothing.  I will definitely be ordering more .</li>
    <li> My husband was told by his ophthalmologist that had a slight cataract.  Rather than to &amp;#34;go under the knife&amp;#34; (laser) he decided to try CAN-C instead.  When he went back to the eye doctor a few months later he was told the cataract was dissolving.  The doc was astonished and thought something was wrong with HIS equipment when his eye got considerably better.  However my husband stopped using the product and the cataract worsened. The only drawback is that he has to use it daily.</li>
    <li> I bought these, because my vet told me my 9 year old beagle had starting developing cataracts. At the same time my cousing had a 12 year old french poodle completely blind (smashing herself with chairs and furnitune in the house, and not going out to the garden any more) due to cataracts as well.&lt;br /&gt;I decided that even they are expensive, I read very cheerfully reviews, so I have them a try.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for my bealge and one for the french poodle.  Both have run the first 2 bottles (5ml each), the beagle cataract is almost unnoticable, she is catching the treats again!!! before that, she would just let them drop, and the smell them till she found them, not catching them any more, now she is back in the game, catching the treats!! we are very happy.&lt;br /&gt;About the french poodle, her left eye is starting to clearly improve! she doesnt hit herself any more, and she&#x27;s even confident to go outside the garden again!! Great product, it really works, im buying second and third boxes to continue with the treatment.!!</li>
    <li> I AM STILL USING THE EYE DROPS AND LOOKING FOR IMPROVEMENT IN VISION!!  I DO NOT KNOW IF THE DROPS ARE HELPING MY VISION.</li>
    <li> I have not been using it long enough to see any real difference ( about 1.5 months so far) so far but I do notice that the halo&#x27;s and floaters have diminished slightly.</li>
    <li> Since I have macular degeneration , the Can-C drops only work, if taken together with The Can-C Plus tablets, N-acetyl-carnosine shares the same pathway as lutein, which I am taking for my eyes. If the drops are taken with the tablets, it is balanced out. Now the cataract seems to disappear.</li>
    <li> It did not work like it was suppose to. I had no positive results.</li>
    <li> Not helping much... After 5 months using it... I have just got a Cataract surgery.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money for surgery! Not recommended!</li>
    <li> These eye drops still have not had the desired effect.</li>
    <li> I very good product and as always speedy delivery of order</li>
    <li> this stuff really worked for my two Chihuahuas.  one is 13 and one is 14 and they had really bad cataracts.  I only use it once a day but it has brought back so much of their vision.  not ALL of it, but enough for them to have a better quality of life.  now they want to go outside and don&#x27;t wander or get lost.  this is super stuff!</li>
    <li> Had developed a cataract in one eye and used a different product to keep it at bay for several years. This year was diagnosed with one in my other eye and decided to try a different product. We&#x27;ll see how this one does since the other product did not get rid of the one I had.</li>
    <li> Great product for dry eyes and early stage cataracts! Been using this product for a year and have better sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time and I was happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Over a year ago I began to notice a half moon appearing in my vision every time I looked through my left eye at a point source (dot) of light. My vision in that eye was also getting very blurry. Soon the half moon turned in to a full circle, or halo, whenever I looked through my left eye at a point of light. I went to an ophthalmologist  who told me I was developing a cataract in that eye. He said it could stay the same for awhile but would get worse over time. He may have been correct but I was not willing to sit back and just accept it. I researched a bit and came across CAN-C. I read all the testimonials, good and bad, including all that were posted here and decided it was well worth a try. It&#x27;s been a over year now using the CAN-C and my vision is completely back to normal. In fact after 6 months my left eyes was actually better than my right. There are a few good tips that I can pass on to those who want to give this a try:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Stay the course. It will not happen overnight. As many people have indicated you may not see results for 5 or 6 months. I did seem some gradual improvement when I started it but it wasn&#x27;t until almost  5 1/2 months using it 3 times a day that all of a sudden I noticed a huge improvement. It can take that long but is well worth the effort when it finally kicks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I took it three times a day religiously for the first year. I don&#x27;t think I missed once in the entire first year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I took the 3rd drop right before bed so my eye would remain closed right after taking the drop where the constant normal blinking you do during the day wouldn&#x27;t wash it all away so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  After 2 months I started taking an eye supplement. I took the Twinlab OcuGuard Plus capsules. Two in the morning and two at night. I wish i would have started taking this sooner as it really seemed to accelerate my vision getting better. My theory was they the CAN-C was dissolving the film that the cataract caused therefore I needed to help the eye heal at the same time I was breaking down the cataract. I think the combination worked extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: For me it worked. My cataract is completely gone and my eye is back to normal. The trick is time. You need to stay with it for at least 6 months and do not miss the 3 times a day if you can help it. Take an eye supplement to give your eye everything it need to repair itself. I still use it twice a day. I hope my experience will be helpful to those about to give this a try. Best of luck to you. I hope it works as well for you as it did for me.</li>
    <li> I gave this product full stars, as it has actually dept my secondary cataracts on hold, and, I  feel, kept my macular degeneration on hold. After a less than impressive eye exam, with both conditions threatening surgery, I ordered Can-C. The next visit, months later, I was told my conditions had not progressed at all and I was put on normal check back status. I found I was able to see more clearly when I read the paper after being on the product for a few weeks. I figured I had little to lose, and if it helped, it was worth the trial. I continue to use the drops, hoping the threatened surgeries will remain far in the future.</li>
    <li> Can C may be okay for some people. It was contra-indicated for me by 3 doctors.&lt;br /&gt;Try it at your own risk.  I do not recommend VITA STREAM&#x27;s CanC Eye Drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Reputable Company I do recommend is Vision Clarity Eye Drops.&lt;br /&gt;With Vision Clarity Eye Drops I had no negative effects....and after 1 month,&lt;br /&gt;  the cloudiness is disappearing and Sight in general is improving, etc.</li>
    <li> While this works for some people, it doesn&#x27;t help others.&lt;br /&gt;For me it has slowed down the cataract growth, for which I am grateful.</li>
    <li> After 2-1/2 years of using this product, I&#x27;ve decided to try prayer.  It will probably work just as quickly.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  See an ophthalmologist if you have cataracts.</li>
    <li> 4 stars because it takes months before any effects are visible.</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> We have been using CAN-C for 6 weeks on my 13 year old Rat Terrier I have see no size change yet in her cataract yet.  I&#x27;m doing a controlled study by applying the drops as directed in just one eye so I can measure any success in the shrinkage and as of this six week assessment have seen no measurable success.I bought enough product for 3 months for both eyes so this should be a 6 month trial. My dog use to love catching mini marshmallows and would never miss one. As her eyesight grew worse they started bouncing off her nose and now if she get 1 out of 10 she is lucky. I have been measuring her progress each week to see if this ability improves by throwing 10 marshmallows  one at a time and the best she has done is 3 of 10 but not constantly. It could be progress but I will continue to monitor and administer the test over the next 4 months and see if there is any measurable improvements. Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> Doctor said I had a small cataract - started using these drops - one year later, doctor says he doesn&#x27;t see it</li>
    <li> If this cures my cataract it will definitely get 5 stars. I&#x27;ll let you know how it does in 4 months.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to know yet about any long term help.  I did find that it solved my night time dry eye problem so ordered more.  The literature that came with the boxes was not sufficient though as I did order more and got literature that told me about using one drop at a time and holding it into closed eyes for 30 seconds.  I don&#x27;t know if I can count the first box or not as I didn&#x27;t do it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;But…. since it relieved my night time dry eye, I want to try it longer to see if there are other benefits.  I do have the start of cataracts with the left eye being the worst one so am hoping after a few months that I will be able to come back with a positive review concerning those results.</li>
    <li> my older neighbor has retina pigmentosa and cataracts and asked me for help. his cataracts were so bad he couldn&#x27;t see and just sat on his porch all day.  numerous doctors would not operate because they were afraid they would damage the nerves in his eyes.  I gave him a couple of boxes of can-c eye drops to try, his wife called his doctor and he told her not to let him take them because they would damage his eyes.  he decided just to try one eye on his own.  within 2 weeks he can see golf balls and his eye is clear. needless to say he is very excited!  I don&#x27;t know about the retina pigmentosa and don&#x27;t really think it will help with it, but you never know.  but, if can-c gives him even a few months of eyesight it is worth it and he is excited!</li>
    <li> Used at bedtime, this helps keep my eyes from getting dry overnight.</li>
    <li> These are my third and fourth boxes.  Wrote a positive review on the others.  They don&#x27;t cure but they definitely help.</li>
    <li> still have cateracts, but pain is gone!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in my vision the first time I used it. And it doesn&#x27;t burn. I use it along with Dr. Schultze&#x27;s eyebright formula and it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> These drops are a bit hard to get out of the bottle - the drop just hangs there. A pretty good study was done on this product which is summarized here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19503764 .  I&#x27;m not sure if the author of the study, the bio-physicist Dr Mark Babizhayev, has a connection with the manufacturer, Innovative Vision Products, Inc.  In any case, I plan to continue with the drops, as it can take up to 9 months to maybe notice anything.  I have beginnings of cataracts, so I figure these could be helpful.  I think my vision is a bit clearer.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I use it on me and I use it on my dog as she has  a cataract as well as me having the beginning stages. I&#x27;m seeing better and my dog&#x27;s eyes are clearing up as well. What else is there to say!</li>
    <li> Using this for both me and my dog for three months and I am definitely seeing better then I did.</li>
    <li> It takes a long while to clear up you eyes with Can&#x3D;See.  IL do not think I should have to continue to rate the product for reorders.</li>
    <li> This was a reorder product, I had purchased it before, and wanted to keep using it, until my eye problems disappear. My husband is also going on this in the future.</li>
    <li> I got this for my pug dog who developed diabetes and then went blind with cataracts.  My wife and I started using this product for her after rave reviews here.  We consistently gave her the drops hoping to see improvement in her vision.  She seems always to be able to detect light from darkness and to avoid large objects like couches and chairs but not able to see fingers in front of her face.  We decided that the drops were not helping her vision and after a few months stopped them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of weeks our poor pug was bumping into walls and not able to distinguish and avoid those large stationary objects any longer.  We thought maybe the CAN-C was working after all.  We started re-administering it to her and within two weeks she is back to not bumping her head into objects again.  Convinced us.  We&#x27;ll stick with it this time.</li>
    <li> notice a great difference in dryness and night blindness</li>
    <li> I bought this for 10 year old shihtzu who has cataracts and after two weeks I started seeing improvement. She started seeing again.  She was more playful and not bumping into things. Her eyes have cleared up substantially. Here I am buying it again.</li>
    <li> useless..does absolutly nothing</li>
    <li> These drops are SOOOOOOOO soothing to my eyes--I always carry some with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> Complicated eye problems and much discomfort. This seems to be working to make me more comfortable.  Time will tell if there are lasting benefits.  So far, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  I just started my second bottle.</li>
