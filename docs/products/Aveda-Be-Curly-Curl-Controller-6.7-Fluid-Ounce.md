    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is really Aveda...I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;Be Curly&amp;#34; from the salon and this is a totally different product. I guess I should have known with the pricing being a darn good deal. If it seems to good to be true, it usually is. :(</li>
    <li> Love aveda curly hair products</li>
    <li> I usually use a  diffuser and this left the curls crunchy rather than soft.  I loved the old Aveda product called Curl Controller, but I think it&#x27;s discontined.  I did see it on EBay for almost $90.00!  ARGH.  I&#x27;m still playing with cocktails of products to see if I can make this work, but right now I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  Having said all of that, the smell of this is wonderful!</li>
    <li> There is a wait list on this product at the salon I go too, so I did the next easiest thing. Bought it on Amazon. It was the same price here as it was in the salon and it got delivered to my home. I bought two to make it easy. By the way...it works.</li>
    <li> Received product as indicated.</li>
    <li> expensive in my world</li>
    <li> leaves hair curly ,leaving it soft and flowing...</li>
    <li> It takes my hair from a state of frizz to soft curls. It&#x27;s not sticky or gooey either. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products ever for naturally curly hair...I only wish it came in a extra large size!</li>
    <li> Works great and at a very good price. Quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair!</li>
