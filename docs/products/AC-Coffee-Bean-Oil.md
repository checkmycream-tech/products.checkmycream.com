      <li>Love Love Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the smell it reminds me of coco butter.</li>
      <li>This product does make you sweat after applying it, so I would recommend using it for working out to help you sweat, it&#x27;s better than albolene.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t really feel the thermo effects as it stated, but it moisturizes the skin really good</li>
      <li>I feel and see a huge difference  on my skin.</li>
      <li>this keeps my skin hydrated, no smell does have a light brown tint to it.</li>
      <li>Good product so far.</li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>Now I have this &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; size sweet smelling cream....</li>
      <li>Not for morning quick lotion.</li>
      <li>Love this, can definitely feel thermal activity when applied and it has a lovely shea or coca butter smell.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re prone to dry skin it will not be good for you.</li>
      <li>I recommend doing a body scrub first!</li>
      <li>I think this Green Coffee Bean Oil cream is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, have not noticed a huge difference in the last three weeks.</li>
      <li>Sweet like vanilla or something...just checked ingredients and there was &amp;#34;caramel&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>but it did go on my skin well and was quickly absorbed.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>Having tried other similar products, I&#x27;ve found that this one worked best and the size lasted for quite awhile.</li>
      <li>I have many thermogenic products and even the most mundane ones provide a&amp;#34;tingly&#x27; or &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Would most definitely purchase another jar..</li>
      <li>I guess if you massage really well until this cream get absorbed, maybe you get the effect of &amp;#34;thermo&amp;#34; since massage stimulate blood circulation and may help reduce cellulite..., not the cream.</li>
      <li>Be sure to run in circular motions until you can&#x27;t see the white of the lotion anymore-just like direction say to do.</li>
      <li>Well this is really helping this area!</li>
      <li>Love the way this lotion makes my skin feel, will definetly buy again in the future!</li>
      <li>So I hope to see some results in the next couple weeks. :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m liking this product so far goes on smooth and don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it,</li>
      <li>It really work I started to see results around week three of consistent use.</li>
      <li>It does small good</li>
      <li>it really works.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say if I see results</li>
      <li>highly recommend.!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t seem much change in the appearance of my skin, but it is mositurrizing.</li>
      <li>I believe it is to be used in a wrap to really be beneficial</li>
      <li>Did not expect the product to really work but had hoped it might do something.  </li>
      <li>and I really like the smell of it.</li>
      <li>Better than Palmer&#x27;s or any other over the counter- firming cream I ve tried.</li>
      <li>and it seems to be helping with firming, especially noticing in difference on the neck area and right below</li>
      <li>This product has mixed reviews, but i have to say it did feel tingly cooling when I applied it for the first time today.</li>
      <li>Smells ok, not gross like a lot of other products.</li>
      <li>My skin seems firmer, so the cellulite is less noticeable, my scars feel smoother and it is also great for dark, dry knees.</li>
      <li>so haven&#x27;t seen any improvement so far.</li>
      <li>massage it on my thighs and they appear firm and fit although I do work out 5 times a week</li>
      <li>It makes my skin so soft and I like the smell.</li>
      <li>wow this makes me sweat</li>
      <li>So far the product is making my skin feel softer  and smoother.</li>
      <li>I have used it for roughly 3 weeks now and can firmly state that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than a coffee based lotion.</li>
      <li>and if for no other reason, I would order it again.</li>
      <li>I expected too much from the product.</li>
      <li>which I have yet to try but plan to in the near future.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical when I read other reviews but this stuff is amazing!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I started using this product as soon as it arrived back in February.  I can&#x27;t really say if I see results but I have been told that I am looking toned.  I just love this product because it smells so good and if for no other reason, I would order it again.</li>
    <li> This cream has a nice scent and I am eager to see some results.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product twice a day plan to order more and check out some more products from the company.  It is even a great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I love the smell it reminds me of coco butter. I don&#x27;t really feel the thermo effects as it stated, but it moisturizes the skin really good I feel and see a huge difference  on my skin. This product does make you sweat after applying it, so I would recommend using it for working out to help you sweat, it&#x27;s better than albolene. Would I buy it again? Sure.</li>

    <li> Have seen no results.</li>
    <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work well. Product had a pleasant odor</li>
    <li> Great product . I use this product before n after workouts along with my sweat waist trainer. I notice my waist is trimming down. I guess you can say it help aids with using the sweat band. The smell isn&#x27;t over whelming. Would most definitely purchase another jar..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only 2 weeks since I had the cream so haven&#x27;t seen any improvement so far. Hoping soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!! Would definitely buy again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my tummy, thighs, neck and it seems to be helping with firming, especially noticing in difference on the neck area and right below were my necklines on my shirts rest. Definitely firming it, you know, they say the neck always gives away a woman&#x27;s age.  Well this is really helping this area!</li>
    <li> It really work I started to see results around week three of consistent use.</li>
    <li> Does not appear to do anything, using it as lotion only</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m liking this product so far goes on smooth and don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it, massage it on my thighs and they appear firm and fit although I do work out 5 times a week this keeps my skin hydrated, no smell does have a light brown tint to it. Good product so far.</li>
    <li> I got the lotion yesterday and I put it on and went to the gym. I was sweating already before I started working out. It makes my skin so soft and I like the smell. I will write again to let you know if I have results but I DO feel a tingling sensation, slight but it&#x27;s there. We shall see 🙏🏼</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any results smells good but nothing thermal feels like a regular lotion that&#x27;s it. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Love it, doesn&#x27;t have the sticky feel that most creams do</li>
    <li> This product has mixed reviews, but i have to say it did feel tingly cooling when I applied it for the first time today. So I hope to see some results in the next couple weeks. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff smells SO GOOD! I have been using on my thighs to help reduce cellulite and saw a little improvement. I believe it is to be used in a wrap to really be beneficial which I have yet to try but plan to in the near future. All in all a great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> No noted difference in firming but it does keep my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> There were some ingredients that I don&#x27;t like to use, was not impressed with the smell but it did go on my skin well and was quickly absorbed.</li>
    <li> It seems to make skin smoother and I really like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> makes your skin tight and soft, like going to a spa. highly recommend.!</li>
    <li> does not work. smells horrible. not worth you&#x27;re money or time</li>
    <li> Its bigger than i expected.  I just started using it . I love the smell. It smells just like the palmers cocoa butter formula products.  I have 4 kids and my tummy aint cute. I took a picture before i started using it. I will take another one in a few weeks to see it it really works. Im praying that it does :-)</li>
    <li> Love this, can definitely feel thermal activity when applied and it has a lovely shea or coca butter smell. Awesome lotion!</li>
    <li> No &amp;#34;thermo&amp;#34; effect. Smells sweet and good but it&#x27;s thick and takes long time to be absorbed. Not for morning quick lotion. I guess if you massage really well until this cream get absorbed, maybe you get the effect of &amp;#34;thermo&amp;#34; since massage stimulate blood circulation and may help reduce cellulite..., not the cream. Now I have this &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; size sweet smelling cream....I will use it just as cream. (I personally don&#x27;t care about this smell. Sweet like vanilla or something...just checked ingredients and there was &amp;#34;caramel&amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> Well, as they say, you don&#x27;t always get a hit when you purchase a beauty product. This seems to be the case with this item. I have used it for roughly 3 weeks now and can firmly state that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than a coffee based lotion. I have many thermogenic products and even the most mundane ones provide a&amp;#34;tingly&#x27; or &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effects on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does none of that. Additionally, it&#x27;s somewhat drying for me. I don&#x27;t know about how others have reacted to it. If you&#x27;re looking for a good sized thermogenic body lotion, I would recommend something else. Unless of course you just want a nicely scented body lotion then this may be for you. Be cautious however. If you&#x27;re prone to dry skin it will not be good for you.</li>
    <li> The best product I was trying</li>
    <li> I think this Green Coffee Bean Oil cream is great.Having tried other similar products, I&#x27;ve found that this one worked best and the size lasted for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> it leaves a bit of a film on my skin. the smell is ok</li>
    <li> use it every day, lovely smell, good price.</li>
    <li> Grrrrear buy and amazing quality</li>
    <li> Being generous here - arrived all covered in the goo like someone opened and spilled it. Smells bad, it does give the feeling of tightening but no visual yet.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this product. I have  seen results and smell great.</li>
    <li> My stomach started looking tighter almost instantly. Smells ok, not gross like a lot of other products. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> Still waiting for some results.  Did not expect the product to really work but had hoped it might do something.  It is a nice moisturizer so all is not lost.  For the price an ok purchase.</li>
    <li> I am using this with the rolling method, it seems to work well. It does leave a little tingle after rolling. Nothing is going to perform a miracle, but I feel it does firm the skin some.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, have not noticed a huge difference in the last three weeks. I like hobbit makes my skin fee for the day, it does feel as though I sweat more when I do go to the gym. We will see how the rest of it works out.</li>
    <li> I expected too much from the product. It does small good but I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good product and great price for amount</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I read other reviews but this stuff is amazing! I expected about a months use before I saw results and they are visable for me in two days. I used morning and night for two days and stretch marks of my stomach have gone from 1/2 inch wide to 1/4 inch wide. My skin is so much tighter!!!! I&#x27;ve only had it three days and I ordered two more bottles! Be sure to run in circular motions until you can&#x27;t see the white of the lotion anymore-just like direction say to do.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t seem much change in the appearance of my skin, but it is mositurrizing.</li>
    <li> Please do not buy.Review after 3-4 weeks.Absolutely no results.No thermogenic effect.PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME.</li>
    <li> wow this makes me sweat I love it! I recommend doing a body scrub first!</li>
    <li> Good cream, I use it to get rid of cellulite and it&#x27;s helping me.</li>
    <li> Love the way this lotion makes my skin feel, will definetly buy again in the future!</li>
    <li> A great moisturizer! Have just started but can see a difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Better than Palmer&#x27;s or any other over the counter- firming cream I ve tried. My skin seems firmer, so the cellulite is less noticeable, my scars feel smoother and it is also great for dark, dry knees.</li>
    <li> I love this product going on 3 days and I see and feel the difference already.. I use it morning and night and 1 hr after having it on, this thing makes you sweat!!! Totally worth it. Works on me.</li>
