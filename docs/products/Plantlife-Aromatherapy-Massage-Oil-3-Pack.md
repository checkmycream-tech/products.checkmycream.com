<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not a very good product. All 3 had the exact same ingredients and the two that didn&#x27;t have lavender in the title still had lavender in them causing an allergic reaction.  Would not buy from this company again</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to smells and these were very pleasant.  Loved everything about this product. Application, smoothness and received no headaches from the smell like I do with other products.</li>
    <li> I have got my order, but one of the bottle was haft empty. So I don&#x27;t know what I should do or what you people gonna do about it cuz cuz I paid for it</li>
    <li> The smell and sense in the hand and the body of my clients are amazing! very good result in theraphy</li>
    <li> These massage oils are great. We use them at home, not professionally, but the oil itself spreads well, no drag on the skin, but not overly slick. And the fragrances are very pleasant, not overpowering and don&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
    <li> My clients have really enjoyed the Plantlife Aromatherapy Oils.  Especially the Sore Muscle as it does not smell like your typical analgesic.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the Relax blend myself as the fragrance is a bit \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; for me, however, my clients love it.  I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars due to the lack of labeling.  For clients with allergies I must refrain from this brand as there is not a complete list of ingredients and I don&#x27;t want to risk an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I tried this product on a first-time hunt for a reasonably priced massage oil to use on my girlfriend, whose neck and upper back tighten up from a lot of workday stress. We&#x27;ve used all three scents and really like the smooth application, non-greasy feel and great absorption of this oil blend. But she LOVED the lavender, and appeared to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; faster with it than the others. Naturally, we&#x27;re re-ordering the Lavender. And I have to admit: I don&#x27;t feel or smell like my grandma&#x27;s cachet when she tries it out on me. The scent dissipates fairly quickly and, as I said, the absorption lets you savor the body hum and not worry about an oily mess. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with Plantlife Aromatherapy Massage Oil-3 Pack and would buy from this seller again. My wife love these oils. Thanks very much.</li>
    <li> Some of the best fragrances! I mix these with my massage creme or use them by themselves, either way they are amazing oils!  Thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> Very nice. Will reorder</li>
    <li> Very good product, lasts long and helps aching muscles relax</li>
    <li> Smelled really good; but the products leaked in the bag.</li>
    <li> Great scents and nice consistency. Very relaxing while receiving an aromatherapy massage. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells and feel excellent, Great value.</li>
    <li> Lavender is the best among all</li>
    <li> These are pretty good, but I bought them not knowing how awesome plain Coconut, Apricot, or Sesame oil works for massage. If I had to do it again, I would just get a bottle of each of those. But if you really are just looking for the scented oils, these aren&#x27;t bad. Everything smells great, and the orange one makes me want to eat it (dreamsicle scented).</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift basket of TEN things for our TEN year wedding anniversary!  My husband and I LOVED them!!  I also have Asthma, so they are not too strong in scent....but they do smell great!!!</li>
    <li> My massage oil trio came faster than I expected, was packed very nice, was true to advertisement.  What made the experience with this order so special was the free bar of soap that was put in my order.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scents,, relaxing</li>
    <li> Love these oils! Wonderful scents and great glide. Sore Muscle: My Favorite! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I bring to the massage parlor that I go to. Its imperative that I am massage only with this oil.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for a pregnant client of my photography business. They arrived quickly and are as described, but as essential oils are becoming more popular, I would recommend just making your own. The lavender one is just overpowering for me, the scents smell a little artificial if that makes any sense. I just was not a fan. If you have a friend or family that sells some type of MLM oil you would be better off getting your own oil and mixing something along those lines in.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Lavendar and Sore Muscle scents, but I am off and on with how I like the Relax scent(reason for deducting one star). Nonetheless, I would purchase this set again. The sore muscle alone is worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I am really picky with massage oils and I loved all 3 of these ones.  I was weary of the consistency, but it was really nice.  Fragrances were not to heavy or overpowering, but could definetely smell the unique blends throughout the use.      [[ASIN:B00113FWRG Plantlife Aromatherapy Massage Oil- 3 Pack]]</li>
    <li> The lavender is awesome, but the other two smell like the extracts of sugary cereals or something. I just used the Sore Muscle and it smells like the sickeningly strong smell of Fruit Loops and/or Dino Fruity Pebbles. Very artificial. The lavender smells AWESOME. I gave it three stars because, even though I will stick with Badgers ginger massage deep tissue oil, it did seem to work a little.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well. I like the relax one the best</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this set! I read one review that said that all 3 oils smelled similar- but I thought they were all unique, delicate and lovely. The oil is made all natural and made with great ingredients. Very nice consistency. My purchase arrived on time and made for a wonderful Valentine&#x27;s Day gift! I would absolutely recommend these fantastic oils!</li>
    <li> These oils are way beyond what I expected.  The essence and the heat of these oils is very much the reason to call your boyfriend or spouse which ever comes first.</li>
    <li> They smell nice and provide adequate lubrication. If you forget to press the top shut and the bottle falls over the oil drips out quickly and makes a mess so a different bottle design would be better.</li>
    <li> One bottle was opened already which is why I am giving this a 4 star regardless of that this was a great massage oil, I will buy it again when I run out but the smell are very similar to each other.</li>
    <li> LIKED THIS PRODUCT-VERY SOOTHING FOR MASSAGE THERAPY AND SMELLS VERY GOOD, BUT A LITTLE PRICEY. PRODUCT ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND WAS WELL PACKAGED.</li>
    <li> Perfect oils for small jobs. lasts a long time as used sparingly. Definitely recommended by those who enjoy an aromatic rub</li>
    <li> Lacks a pleasant aroma, not as &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; as other oils.</li>
    <li> I have never gotten around to using this item</li>
    <li> These are great massaging oils.  My wife loves the light lavander scent and the fact that the sheets do not get stained.  The oils feels great and get absorbed in a timely fashion, not leaving any residues on the skin.  The Sore Muscle oil is great for after sports massages.  All in all a good product although a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Scents are too potent.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Relax&amp;#34; is not very citrus...has a rancid smell to it.</li>
    <li> We really enjoy the orange bottle. The other bottles really are not that pleasant. I think there&#x27;s better stuff on the market.</li>
    <li> They are good, but a bit to strong of a smell</li>
    <li> We have used two of the bottles.  They are fabulous.  We are not professionals but work on each other as we are married and enjoy pampering one another.  The Lavender is heavenly!</li>
    <li> My favorite massage oil of all times. It feels great on the skin and the smell is pleasant. It is not overpowering like many other massage oil. Very gentle.</li>
    <li> I like variety of oils and these oils are good for professional massage.  Some oils are expensive and these oils are good.  These oils are part of my items to the client by feeling good.</li>
    <li> I still have these oils after 3 years... these things last forever and really get the job done!~</li>
    <li> I love this product for the simple fact it is not greasy.  It is very soothing for the simple fact, when you are giving using this product on others you are also using this product on your own hands.  I enjoy products of this nature that do not have an odor.  Any product that has a smell of fruit will make you hungry.  No one wants to be hungry while getting treatment.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and doesnt leave your skin feeling all sticky and oily after the massage.</li>
    <li> My fiance and me loved this items! we both have stresfull jobs and like relaxing at home.. this are great for us! the smell its like the spa kind...</li>
    <li> I love this set! Massage time is so relaxing.. Each scent smells nice! My favorite is relax (yellow label). Refreshing! May have to reorder soon!</li>
    <li> Have tried many, these oils have excellent glide and aroma. Number one for value as well, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice size bottles, I was pleased with that!.&lt;br /&gt;Great aroma smell. Fast delivery too!&lt;br /&gt;The oil was not greasy, it worked into the skin really nice.</li>
    <li> These massage oils smell wonderful, leave your skin soft and supple and don&#x27;t dry out quickly. I personally love the lavander and the relax ones, they really do ease your stress. Yes, the bottles are small, but they are well worth the price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I received this product as described, and it is a great massage oil! Highly recommend this company, I needed larger quantities and they gave me the manufacturers info.</li>
    <li> Nice, light oils, with a pleasant fragrance. The lavender is my favorite. I would buy these again. A bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Great oils! Doesn&#x27;t leave stains on the sheet, days fast, great smell.  I Will buy more when these run out!</li>
    <li> Excellent smells good feels good on the skin arrived on time...</li>
    <li> We absolutely love these oils and I&#x27;m sure will be ordering more soon. So far, we&#x27;ve used one or more of them every night, and they smell even better on the skin than in the bottle. We also received a small lavender soap sample from Plantlife that we loved. All three oils and this seller highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great gift to my wife. Bought a massage table and the oils are great. Bottle is smaller than I thought but very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> My husband and I give each other massages and we just love this oil.  I like how you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the job done</li>
    <li> They glide easily, they are plant based (which is the best), and their scents are awesome too. Will definitely order them again.</li>
    <li> IT is some great all natural message oil. The fragrence of the message oil is fantastic my wife loves this stuff especially after a message. You also do not have to use a ton of this oil so the bottles of oil should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an oil that wasn&#x27;t greasy and that went a long way. This oil was perfect and the scents are wonderful.  Exactly like what they use in a professional spa for massage.</li>
    <li> Great oil but not big fan of the smell, but that is personal.</li>
    <li> Oil fine; container not easy to use.</li>
    <li> The oils were great.  The feel and viscosity were spot on. The scents were enticing,  But I feel that, for the price, the bottles should have been bigger.  I went thru my order in a week and a half.  Im going to have to reorder.</li>
    <li> i like the smell of these oils.  But i prefer more single oils for massages and essential oils specific to relaxing or pain.  The amounts are going to last for  more than one massage and that is good.  The flip tops work well for easy dispensing.  They are great starter oils.</li>
    <li> I bought these oils on a whim and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.  My only real complaint is that all three smell very similar.  I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to massage oils so maybe they are supposed to smell that way - maybe they all have the same bases and I&#x27;m not familiar with the way it&#x27;s done... but I would have appreciated a little more variety.  I do have to agree with one of the other reviewers - they are quite smooth and an excellent texture.</li>
    <li> The yellow one is the best sent, kind of citrus. I went back and just purchased move of this sent. Great quality.</li>
    <li> My favorite oils...very affordable and non greasy and lovely and varied aromatherapy. Which reminds me I need to order more!</li>
    <li> This was the first massage oil I have ever purchased for personal use, so I really didn&#x27;t have anything to compare it to initially. All three smell incredible (my personal favorite is the sore muscle oil). My husband and I give each other massages a few times a month, and after the first time using this, I washed my upper back and shoulders since the oil felt heavy on my skin. I noticed that I had a very slight breakout a few days later. Even if I washed off in the shower, it always seemed like I would get a few pimples the following week. The breakouts were slightly worse when I would fall asleep during the massage since I wasn&#x27;t able to wipe off my skin. We kept using these (since they were on the pricey side and I couldn&#x27;t justify buying new oils when these had so much use left in them). I purchased [[ASIN:B007P0ARXS NOW Foods - Rose Massage Oil 8 Oz]] when these ran out, and the difference is dramatic. My skin now feels soft and moisturized, but I never break out anymore.</li>
    <li> This product arrived sooner than I expected and the company followed up with an email to be sure that I was satisfied with it.  I have only used one of the three bottles so far, but I like all of the scents.  The oil is nice to work with.  I would definitely buy it again from this company.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of this massage oil - it&#x27;s smooth, doesn&#x27;t get sticky, and absorbs well.  I also like that all of the ingredients are natural.  My favorite scents are the Relax (orange vanilla) and Rejuvenate (peppermint - kind of a menthol smell but I like it).  Shipping costs are high, but it&#x27;s worth it.  This company also has great customer service - I emailed and asked if I could order samples of their oils to pick a scent, and they sent me ~6 small bottles free of charge.  Very useful, since the oil names have nothing to do with the scent. :)  I highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> Effective moisturizer after shower - light scent</li>
    <li> Nothing special, like most oils</li>
    <li> Great scents and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Like the products, but will not order three-pack next time as I like the scent of the Relax formulation best.  My daughter and I both like that scent best and will reorder as needed.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wow !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Excellent product and my lover was so receptive to the massage and the oil did the trick. Smells good, and tasted good (smile). Thank you so much for a good job. I&#x27;ll be ordering more. Is there any other products that you sell that would enhance the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lloyd</li>
    <li> This is a good quality massage oil. I have used the purple label last night on my wife and she enjoyed it. The oil absorbs well into the skin.  I hope I can order a sample pack so I can pick a scent when I order again in the future.</li>
    <li> I feel great. a very good product.</li>
    <li> Very Aromatic and soothing. You will definitely love each bottle.</li>
    <li> I like the scents of these massage oils but the amount you get is pretty small. Kind of on the greasy side but not too bad. I would give it a higher rating if you got larger bottles. Feel like you have to skimp on it to give a full body massage.</li>
    <li> I got this along with a massage book, and everything was kept sealed, but when I smelled each and had my husband do the same, the Lavender was just so simliar to the sore muscle one, the relax one smells like oranges and cream, or as my husband said a car scent, he also said the lavender smelled like oregano. They aren&#x27;t super huge, but a good size I suppose, but some of the scents are rather strong, so far I like relax the most.</li>
    <li> Awesome massage oils... Great smell and they last a long time. You won&#x27;t regret buying them</li>
    <li> Sore muscle and Lavender smell great, the third, &amp;#34;Relax&amp;#34; smells like an orange Creamsicle which doesn&#x27;t relax me at all.  If you like the smell of Creamsicle and want to include it in your massage you will love it, otherwise I&#x27;d look around for a different combination of scents.  The oils are high quality and work well and the price is nice. It&#x27;s just the one off-putting smell.</li>
    <li> Very nice selection; smells are great!</li>
    <li> We love all three fragrances.  This is the best massage oil we have found anywhere.  We highly recommend this oil!</li>
    <li> Great Product with awesome smell. Exactly what I wanted and needed for couples massages. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent !!!!  not too greasy , wonderful scents I will purchase again, and highly recommend !!!!</li>
    <li> the smells are extremely loud.  not surethat the smells really match what they are called except for the lavendar.  one has this loud citrus smell.  not that i want to walk around smelling like an orange.  probably wouldnt purchase this product again</li>
    <li> What a fantastic deal for 3 different scents! These oils are great for massaging, not too slippery and the aromatherapy aspect is wonderfully relaxing. My next order of these might be sooner than I expected!</li>
    <li> Very good aroma/fragrance. Not too strong so my client doesnt leave emanating strong scent for the rest of his day, but it can be smelt only by him.</li>
    <li> The Orange scent is nice but the other 2 are a bit strong on the odor for us but we don&#x27;t care for odors in our oils.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a really good and inexpensive massage oil. These fit the bill. Three different scents for three different moods. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the size of the bottles but they are a great size!</li>
    <li> Just got this nice sampler of three oils a few weeks ago.  So far we&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;sore muscle&amp;#34; oil, which is somewhat spicy compared to the other two, but still a very nice scent.  The lavender smells wonderful too and I can&#x27;t wait to use it!  I don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; as much, but it&#x27;s probably because it has a bit of vanilla scent in it, which I don&#x27;t care for.  But the oils are very nice, they have enough body for a great massage, but yet they don&#x27;t leave greasy residue on sheets, towels, clothes, etc., like some do.  I also like the idea of the sampler 3-pack so that you can decide what you&#x27;d like to buy in larger quantities.</li>
    <li> I purchased these oils because I was having a hard time finding anything in the local stores that were actually for massage and smelled good, too. These are great for massage and they smell wonderful. There is no greasy feel after a massage and they don&#x27;t stain the sheets or clothing. I am very satisfied with this product and will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> All the oils smell amazing.  I use the Sore Muscle one the most and it really works.  Weather you actually use them as formal massage oils or just to moisturize your skin they are great.  Not greasy.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been enjoying the massage oils very much.  The fragrances are thoroughly delightful, and  we particularly like the fact that there is no greasy or oily feeling or residue.  We both recommend them without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Beautifully scented oil that made my massage even more enticing !! Highly recommended since it&#x27;s all natural</li>
    <li> I love your products they are wonderful..........</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for a friend and they are wonderful.  The &amp;#34;sore muscle&amp;#34; one is fabulous.  The only thing that would make this product better was if they came in a larger size!</li>
    <li> Look no further! This is it! Nice fragrance but not strong. Feels good on skin and very relaxing. Not sticky. Shipped fast. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I have used the the relax oil only and found it to work as advertised.  My wife is alergic to everything but not this oil.  It works great.</li>
    <li> Having different scents was real nice to change up the mood from day to day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good deal for a special occasions.</li>
    <li> The oil has a subtle scent that is not overpowering. It does not feel creasy, yet it works well for massages.</li>
    <li> this oil gets spoil soon after it is open</li>
    <li> I sent this as a gift to my son, along with a massage table. He is well pleased with the oils !</li>
    <li> These oils are great. I am a therapist and I am very pleased with them. I highly recommend them. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money. Oils smell great and really relaxes. Bought the book of massage to go with it. Great combo.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom as a present.  Happy with purchase and would buy again. I believe it is a good product</li>
    <li> Wonderful smelling... One actually smells like a liquid creamsicle, which is amusing.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, smells great.</li>
    <li> We have been using these oils for over six months. The 3-pack deal are an incredible value for such a reasonable price. Once a week my husband and I get a massage in our home and with these oils the scents put us into deep relaxation mode and our skin feels silky smooth for days, even after showering. My husband loves them just as much as I do too!</li>
    <li> Subtle, non-irritating scents.</li>
    <li> Great fragrances and quick delivery. Happy!</li>
    <li> Our massage therapist used the oils for the first time last week.  We as clients and she as the therapist couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The oil is a bit &#x27;thicker&#x27; than baby oil which seemed to me to allow for better traction when massaging deep muscles.  It&#x27;s not as &#x27;slick&#x27;.  We are pleased with the scents.  The campho is really noticeable in the oil for sore muscles.  The product came as ordered, no leakage and came in a timely manner.  We will order this product again from this company.  We are completely satisfied with all aspects of the transaction.</li>
    <li> Nice, light oils, with a pleasant fragrance. The lavender is my favorite. I would buy these again. A bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Not overly &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34; . . . very subtle but lasting. Leaves skin smooth and not greasy. I will order again.</li>
    <li> So far I have only used the sore muscle massage oil, but the scent was light and pleasant, and I didnt need to use very much. I know this will last a while. Such a good price for the quality and amount.</li>
    <li> Husband is suffering from unknown muscle pain...nice stuff to use to work the muscles in his shoulders and hips...gave him some relief when other types of stuff didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> The different smells are nice. kinda wish the bottles were a little bigger in ounces though. you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> as part of a package deal i didnt think i would use this, until i opened them up and tried them out</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and they smell very good.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bought this product was to use with stone massage.&lt;br /&gt;They are over priced I think for the amount you get.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you can&#x27;t find massage oil somewhere cheaper.</li>
    <li> i got this for my husband and he said he likes it,the smell is so relaxing,i would buy it again</li>
    <li> These scents weren&#x27;t for me</li>
    <li> Great wedding gift with a tasteful and instructional massage book.  Couple enjoyed the oils and the romantic gesture the most.</li>
    <li> We purchased this with our message table &amp; we love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly decent size bottles for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally love the Sore Muscle mix.&lt;br /&gt;My GF loves the Lavender one.</li>
    <li> Not only do all three products have a great smell, the oil lasts on the skin for a good time while massaging however does not linger &amp; does not stain clothing etc.</li>
    <li> These oils were the first things to arrive from my order and they were just what I was expecting and the price was less than anything available in stores locally.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Quick delivery by the seller. Very happy with my purchase. Great deal!</li>
    <li> I really like the smell and the consistency of these oils.  We use them weekly and I never tire of them.  My only issue is that they are hard to wash off the shower floor, even with soap and water -- the floor is usually a bit oily for a day or so after using.  That&#x27;s a small issue for us, though.  Otherwise, they are wonderful.</li>
    <li> These massage oils smell great, and are free from toxic substances found in others.  Buy them and start massaging today.</li>
    <li> Perfect combination for a husband and wife massage.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the consistency of the oil. Just right with no lasting stickiness. Will order this product again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the relaxation bottle so far but it&#x27;s great, the scent is natural and not overpowering.  Feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> althou i like th yellow scent better than the other ones because smell sweet, i can&#x27;t believe i still have them they last forever it seems like it will never runs out from the bottle, a little goes a long way. very nice</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist and I bought these oils to try in my salon.  Very pleased with them.  The one for sore muscles is especially effective.  I have lots of clients eager to come back for more!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  Excellent stuff.  Spoil her a little.</li>
    <li> The bottles were smaller than I expected, but the aromas are really nice. I also received two coupons off my next order. That was really nice.</li>
    <li> these oils work magic and wonders while massaging. highly recomended for the use with sore muscles great product hands down</li>
    <li> after  few day the odor gone</li>
    <li> All three scents are usuable.  But the Relax scent is incredible!  Smells like orange-vanilla creamsicles.  The other two are fine, but a bit strong.  As far as texture and longevity of the oil- I would say it&#x27;s average.  Nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> love this oil pack !!</li>
    <li> Quality: Good, Price: Excellent Convenience: Good. I use it for exterior decoration and looks good. When I look at it my reaction is: &amp;#34;I pay only a fraction of it would it cost me in a regular store&amp;#34;. Thank you amazon.com</li>
    <li> Nice oils. Go s long way. Smell great.</li>
    <li> Very nice. If feels good on the skin and the smell is very pleasing. The only think I don&#x27;t like is the price, I think it is expensive because if you use the oils conistently you ran out of them fast, so it is like paying a rent to keep buying them. I will not buy them repeatedly because of the price.</li>
    <li> I am an amateur when it comes to massages, but my wife really enjoyed the oils and I came out smelling like a rose</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way!  Very pleased with the quality and product price.  My boyfriend and I both enjoy!</li>
    <li> Purchased these for self massage. I find the scents to be very relaxing and pleasurable.  I&#x27;m usually very sensitive to oils and creams but these did not bother my skin at all. They also dry up pretty fast too.  I wish the bottles were a little larger but this is a good sampler package.</li>
    <li> Very Very nice quality - no joke.  I&#x27;m sure there is better out there but this 3 pk is very nice quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new massage therapist and got these as a gift 4 months ago. The aromas are great, especially the Relax which is loved by clients and myself. While I think the scents are perfectly blended, they are still strong enough to mix with a base/carrier oil, if some people think they are too strong or too expensive (which I personally would have to disagree with).&lt;br /&gt;The only critique I have it that it is quite thin for professional massage use and as such it absorbs into the skin quite quickly. As a result, though I try to use them sparingly, alas, they are almost done, way too soon.&lt;br /&gt;For home/personal usage though, these should last quite a while and the quick absorption will most likely be preferred quality anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with these oils. They go on well and have a pleasant smell to inhance the massage benefits. I&#x27;ve been doing massage therapy for 41 years and have used many types of oils and find this to be one of the best in my opinion</li>
    <li> Smell fabulous yet natural.  Other oils smell fake and induce a headache.  This is a great price for such high quality oils.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are high quality oils. Do not need much oil to get a decent massage. I knocked off a star because these are a bit pricey for my taste. A few dollars cheaper and these would be right on point.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but it lacks in the aroma department.I probably would purchase again. The price is right.The other products with heavenly aroma costs a lot more.I would recommend it, just be prepared for a relatively weak scent</li>
    <li> I found this product to meet my expectations because it soothed my muscles and warmed my soul! The oil arrived on time for me and the person or persons mailed it to get to me in excellent shape.  I recommend this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert at massage oils, but this oil has a nice texture and a light scent.  Every bit as good in my opinion as the more expensive and exotic oils.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> These oils are great.  The only problem is the scents.  The orange smells great but the other two have a eucalyptus smell to it. If you like that, then you should buy it but for me, I&#x27;d prefer something sweeter</li>
    <li> Fragrance is wonderful no complaints</li>
    <li> smells awesome and comforting, haven&#x27;t had the time to use em yet, but i have a feeling i will enjoy em.</li>
    <li> Great for hot stone massages.</li>
    <li> LOVE ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS</li>
    <li> I will give it another try&lt;br /&gt;No fair to judge to harshly at this time&lt;br /&gt;No experienced any issues of the quality</li>
    <li> This is some really nice oil for being as cheap as it is. You get three oils instead of just one, my clients love the smell and the way it makes their skin feels afterwards. If your looking for oil you might want to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I was actually very impressed with the quality of the oils and the aroma. I will reorder the same pack when I am out.</li>
    <li> I found that this particular product is very watery. I think I was expecting a consistency a bit more solid, and less liquid. The smell is pretty decent, but I definitely think there are better products than this out there. Still looking.</li>
    <li> Oils are light and silky feeling they give a very good glide even with heavy pressure. And they smell amazing this will now be my go to products</li>
    <li> Very nice and soothing</li>
    <li> very good but the size is small</li>
    <li> REALLY GREAT .WE BOTH LOVE IT</li>
    <li> A great diverse pack of massage oils for everyday use.  I found them very sensual and relaxing for massage (both giving and receiving).</li>
    <li> These are tiny little 4 ounce  bottles...like you carr on an airplane. The photo exagerates their size..you would assume from the price you are getting mor product. In use, the oils are nothing special..no more quality than what I got from Whole Foods for less money.</li>
    <li> Great massage oils. The aromas are very pleasant and absorbs nicely into the skin. Does not feel too greasy like other massage oils. Will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Very nice massage oil. Smells so so good and also dries nicely on your skin. Not sticky. No need to shower after using it. Makes skin soft. Also no animal testing, this is a plus.</li>
    <li> Loved the oil. I used it as a massage oil and it worked great. It is a dry oil but watch out for your sheets because it will leave oil marks. It does smell great and was relaxing at least according to my so called test dummy since I wanted to try it on someone else.</li>
