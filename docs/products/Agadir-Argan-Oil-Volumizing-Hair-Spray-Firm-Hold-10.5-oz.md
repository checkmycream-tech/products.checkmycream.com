<ol>
    <li> This is amazing. I have curly hair naturally so when I blow dry my hair it&#x27;s always all over the place this hair spray keeps it in one please also love the smell</li>
    <li> A wonderful product. Conditions your hair, doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
    <li> Always a great product</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me as it has others.  I found it weighed down my fine hair rather than add volume.  And the scent was horrendous.  Unfortunately I did have to send it back.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and shipping experience!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair spray ever! It&#x27;s light weight, but still a great hold and brush able too. The scent is nice and it leaves no build up. I love it.</li>
    <li> Best hair spray I have ever purchased .</li>
    <li> Love all the Agadir  Argan products. You have to use it sparingly as it gives extra hold. Was surprised to get 2 for the price I pay retail for one.</li>
    <li> I bought the pack of 2 because I saved money.  If I had purchased the hairspray in a store, it would have cost a lot more.  They were shipped fine, and I have had no problems using the spray.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is perfect.  It holds the hair in place while remaining soft to the touch.  Doesn&#x27;t have a shiney, do not touch look,  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Not the firmest hold, but I really like the smell and it does the job.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful. One thing once you use it I find setting my hair the next time is easier and it continues to hold the style. Adds shine and along with the other products put out by this manufacturer over months of use my hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for two cans! I love this hairspray because it leaves your hair soft and shining without the build up and still provides a stiff hold!</li>
    <li> Only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is the odor after spraying.  You actually have to step away and breath.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for quite some time and love what their products do for my hair. I actually find Agadir&#x27;s products to be better than Moroccan Oil. I use this after I curl my hair, and not only does it hold the curls but it keeps my hair smooth and gives it a healthy sheen.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to maintain texture and health of their hair. My friend uses this product on his hair as well, and has seen a noticeable difference in texture (for the better) in comparison to using a paste or wax.</li>
    <li> I love using this spray.  I love the smell.  The whole product line is great.  I use the agadir oil on my grandkids and they love it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast mail. Wrapped well.</li>
    <li> Love the product, price, and ease of ordering.  I&#x27;m a fan!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Product leaves my curly hair soft, shiny &amp; full of body. I would recommend this to a friend.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel stiff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite hairspray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thin, blonde hair...work 12hr shifts and my hair-do (natural, simple cut) stays touchably soft ALL day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have switched out and tried other products/brands, and I always revert back to this one. Don&#x27;t use anything else anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, should your hair get unintentionally wet (rained on etc) it can make your hair a bit tangly...however, it washes out with ZERO residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t sticky and holds hair. Seems to be non allergenic. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is a really very good product recommended firstly by my hair stylist.  It smells great and makes your hair shine.  It holds very well.  I gave it 4 stars since it doesn&#x27;t do very much for the humidity, at least for my hair.  When there is low humidity, however, it works great, keeps hair shape through the entire day and it brushes off quite easily. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I needed a good hair spray, my hair is thining, it hold hair in place, but live hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping!!!  great product!</li>
    <li> This product is worth trying if your hair tends to look &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;....I don&#x27;t like hairsprays that feel stiff and this is a product that doesn&#x27;t have that feeling when sprayed on.  I intend to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This product works great and holds while creating awesome volume. I would  definitely recommend for color treated or thin hair.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  It works great on mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair; however, the top where the actual hair spray comes out, constantly sticks and gets clogged up...on both mine and my daughters.  We are always having to clean it off in order to use it.  Overall, we like the product, just wish the sprayer wouldn&#x27;t stick.</li>
    <li> love the item and will diffently purchase again from them.</li>
    <li> Love love love the scent and hold. However if you come thru it will look ashy unlike treseme hairspray.</li>
    <li> It holds great without being sticky and did well on my fine hair but I just couldn&#x27;t stand the  smell. I get migraines and can&#x27;t take a lot of fragrance.  It&#x27;s like the old Aqua Net smell. It is a good spray otherwise .If you don&#x27;t mind the smell I would use it.</li>
    <li> I like this spraynet a lot. It seems to make my hair shinier and I feel it&#x27;s good for your hair. Also, there is not a lot of buildup with repeated use. Good product</li>
    <li> Everyone should use this product.I have for many years along with their mouse,shampoo,conditioner,shine and oil.Working in a beauty salon for many years I have come across all major products none of which compares. Your hair is conditioned with each shampoo which saves a lot of money The hair spray does not leave a film and does not leave your hair stiff and has no build up yet does what a good hair spray should.It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Great product! The bottles are very large and will last me quite a while! When I use it, my hair is soft but still keeps it&#x27;s curl, it smell fabulous and I would recommend this Agadir Argan hair spray to anyone who likes a good product!</li>
    <li> BEST hairspray on the market!  LOVE it!  Holds great and just melts when washing out!  Hardly NO build-up!</li>
    <li> A LITTLE EXPENSIVE BUT HOLDS HAIR VERY WELL WITH A LOT OF SHINE</li>
