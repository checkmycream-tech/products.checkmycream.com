      <li>that I see results right away.</li>
      <li>I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  </li>
      <li>My eyes looked very puffy and dark circles became  much more prominent.</li>
      <li>so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product...</li>
      <li>bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  </li>
      <li>You will not have result like Cindy, folks, lets be real!</li>
      <li>This is the first time this has ever happened to me.</li>
      <li>They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample..</li>
      <li>I really like the eye cream.</li>
      <li>It works really well under my makeup.</li>
      <li>and it Did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>I really would not buy this product again; I did not notice any difference whatsoever after using the whole tube.</li>
      <li>If you really want to see a difference in your skin, try La Prairie products.</li>
      <li>I really take care of my eye area and it pays off, believe it.</li>
      <li>This product works really well for me.</li>
      <li>used nearly the whole tube.</li>

      <li>My face as I get older though, I can&#x27;t use just anything or it breaks my face out and so far this has not.</li>
      <li>but because it is not a small size tube.</li>
      <li>I am 51 yrs old</li>

      <li>She as found it to be very helpful for tghe dark circles under her eyes.</li>
      <li>The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  </li>

<li> The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  </li>
<li> I only was interested in the eye serum and after using it for a few days it smoothed skin under my eyes and reduced dark circles.  </li>
<li> My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  </li>
<li> skin is not sensitive.</li>
<li> I use this every single day and have no plans of stopping!</li>
<li> I wish it was little bit bigger though</li>
<li> I have only been using it for a few days so can&#x27;t tell a difference at this point.  </li>
<li> but my yes feel less dry.</li>
<li> Lancôme does just the same, if not better.....</li>
<li> I even had other women ask me what happened to my skin as I never have skin problems.  </li>
<li> My skin is firmer and i look at least five years younger.</li>
<li> After two weeks I didn&#x27;t see any results for my dark circles</li>
<li> I will continue using it, although it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a little tube</li>
<li> I did use this product everyday</li>
<li> was little  worried when I was ordering this product due to some negative reviews</li>
<li> Not sure if it is doing anything it is suppose to.</li>
<li> I ordered the whole introductory kit and was extremely disappointed.  </li>
<li> The packaging is cheap and the products are terrible.  </li>
<li> It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br</li>
<li> I read on the internet where this whole line is listed on the worst skin care list.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it says, and in fact it seemed to make my eyes look worse.</li>
<li> This product should be called meaningless</li>
<li> not impressive.</li>
<li> The refund was tedious...</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been unhappy with other products in this line, but this eye cream specifically is really awful.</li>
<li> What a waste and disappointment!!!!</li>
<li> /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  </li>
<li> incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  </li>
<li> It was so painful.</li>
<li> but I was disappointed with it</li>
<li> It was awful.  </li>
<li> I used this product for 3 days and everytime i used it my eyes would itch terribly.  </li>

    <li> I really would not buy this product again; I did not notice any difference whatsoever after using the whole tube.</li>
    <li> This product works really well for me. It absorbs really quickly with no greasy feeling. It works really well under my makeup.</li>
    <li> Had never used this product and I just love it.  You can bet I will be re-ordering it....on Amazon, of course. I really take care of my eye area and it pays off, believe it.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream excellent product helps with lines around the eyes keeps area clear even reduces the dark circles under eyes</li>
    <li> I used this product around my eyes and I had a massive reaction to it. There is some sort of irritant in it that made my eye lids swell up to the size of golf balls. Even after I washed it off, my eye lids continued to burn the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not sensitive. I can put anything on it and it never breaks out or gets rashy. This is the first time this has ever happened to me. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> used nearly the whole tube. not impressive. I like the neostrada cream with the vitamin K. way better. this wasn&#x27;t much better or any better really than anything at the drug store.</li>
    <li> I have african american skin and it Did absolutely nothing.After two weeks I didn&#x27;t see any results for my dark circles so I stopped using it. I used it in the morning and at night no results. I recommend coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I bought it foe a friend, who keeps asking me to keep ordering it for her.  She as found it to be very helpful for tghe dark circles under her eyes.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Not sure if it is doing anything it is suppose to.I like the way my eyes look after I use the capsules then I apply this. Togeather they are great!</li>
    <li> My eyes looked very puffy and dark circles became  much more prominent. I even had other women ask me what happened to my skin as I never have skin problems.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> I really like the eye cream. At first I found that I could not see results, after 4 weeks I can really see a big difference in my eyes. They are not puffy, and the wrinkles have diminished dramatically. I love the products but won&#x27;t commit myself to buying it through Meaningful Beauty. Lancôme does just the same, if not better.....however Lancôme is pricy as well. If you really want to see a difference in your skin, try La Prairie products. $$$$$$ - you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Love this product...crows feet have been diminishing! Would recommend this production to anyone. Takes away circles under eyes as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased meaninful beauty off the tv. I got my order in and i started using it saying to myself this is all hype. Well within days i started seeing the puffy bags under my eye firming up. And since its almost a month now. My bags are not there. Gone! My skin is firmer and i look at least five years younger. Ladies this stuff works. I am 51 yrs old and i am so glad i took a chance on meaningful beauty.dont take my word for it. Try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> ordered this product through infomercial and gave most of the products that came in the package to my friend.  I only was interested in the eye serum and after using it for a few days it smoothed skin under my eyes and reduced dark circles.  Highly recommended!!!  I will continue using it, although it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a little tube it&#x27;s worth the investment.</li>
    <li> The Meaningful Beauty product line is good but left my face very oily.  The eye cream did not and was good.</li>
    <li> I use this every single day and have no plans of stopping! Its made a huge difference in the skin around my eyes and I will continue to use it!!</li>
    <li> What a waste and disappointment!!!! This product should be called meaningless beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product from the actual meaningful beauty site and they did not even have it in stock.  I found this out after waiting 10 days for my shipment and received nothing... not an email or even a phone call.  So I called them.  They said it was on back order but would be delivered in 5 days.  Luckily, it was delivered in another 5 days.  Also something to remember if you buy the product from their site they automatically set you up for monthly shipments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the products immediately.  The only thing in the bag that was worth the money is the small purple beads with wrinkle reducing serum.  They are amazing and make your skin so soft, but you only get 5 as a sample.. so the only thing that actually smells good and feels nice wont even last you a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways i used the products and after 5 days my face broke out like crazy.  I have great italian skin and have an occasional bump once in a while, but nothing like this.  I used the product as directed on my neck and my neck broke out too. My nose became dry and red, started peeling.  It was so painful. I have used proactive in the past and other facial products and have never broken out like I did with Meaningful Beauty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I took pictures just incase they did not believe me and would not give me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called them, explained what happened and they refunded the purchase price, but not the shipping.  The refund was tedious... i had to give them the numbers on the bottom of each bottle and tell them the exact product... don&#x27;t they already have this information?  They told me to hold onto the product for a month incase I hear from them that there was a bad shipment.  It has been 3 weeks and no word from them, but I would not recommend this product to anyone and would seriously discourage you from purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could post pictures of howbad this product was for me.</li>
    <li> It is best that I used so far! Smooth the fine lines .&lt;br /&gt;I was little  worried when I was ordering this product due to some negative reviews but I am glad I did..I wish it was little bit bigger though</li>
    <li> I can tell when I haven&#x27;t been using the Eye Cream every night. I can sure tell when I have been using it.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 days and everytime i used it my eyes would itch terribly.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have seen it advertised on T.V. so wanted to give it a try. I have only been using it for a few days so can&#x27;t tell a difference at this point.  My face as I get older though, I can&#x27;t use just anything or it breaks my face out and so far this has not.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any changes in fine lines! Definitely would not purchase product again, used the whole tube and didn&#x27;t see results.,</li>
    <li> I did not see significant results. I bought this product in a kit after seen the ad on the TV. I did use this product everyday but I was disappointed with it so I went back to my Avon - Anew line- that I see results right away. You will not have result like Cindy, folks, lets be real!</li>
    <li> this product do nothing for African American women</li>
    <li> I ordered the whole introductory kit and was extremely disappointed.  The packaging is cheap and the products are terrible.  The eye cream made the skin under my eyes red and inflammed.  It was awful.  It took days for the reaction to calm down.  The smell of the face cream is like feet and it does nothing good for your skin.  I am sending the whole kit back.  I am sure this cheap product is not what Cindy Crawford is using on her skin.  I would rate it 0 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I read on the internet where this whole line is listed on the worst skin care list. Draw your own conclusions. I used her products before ever seeing this list and sent them back.</li>
    <li> Great way to try this product without the automatic ship commitment . Haven&#x27;t seen results yet but my yes feel less dry. I got it right away also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been unhappy with other products in this line, but this eye cream specifically is really awful. It doesn&#x27;t do what it says, and in fact it seemed to make my eyes look worse. It didn&#x27;t help with fine lines or dark circles and even left my skin really dry.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I encourage everyone to try it! I will buy this again not just because it works well but because it is not a small size tube.</li>
