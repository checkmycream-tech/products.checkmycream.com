      <li>My absolute favorite hair product.  </li>
      <li>It is my new favorite product.</li>

      <li>I have seriously fine, straight hair</li>
      <li>My favorite by far.</li>
      <li>but it is worth it</li>
      <li>I love how it smells, it makes my hair shine and makes it so easy to blow dry and style.</li>
      <li>Unlike many similiar products, Scruples leaves your hair clean feeling until the next shampoo.  </li>
      <li>You just have to figure out which is the right amount for you hair.</li>
      <li>This Scruples is just the right weight for my thinning hair.  </li>

      <li>Never drying to the hair and works very well.</li>
      <li>It really provides body and hold.</li>
      <li>Gives your hair a nice hold but not too heavy to deal with styling hair.</li>
      <li>It adds more body to my hair than any other I have tried.</li>
      <li>I went back to a product I’ve been happy with in the past --</li>
      <li>It would be better if I reviewed it later, but these cans last so long.&lt;br /&gt;7/10/14</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t speak for straight hair, but it is MUST HAVE for naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>I normally use a gel just to help &#x27;control&#x27; my hair.  </li>
      <li>Very light, but holds style well, whether you air dry or blow dry.</li>
      <li>This works better than any product I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m completely baffled by all the positive reviews unless my experience is simply an anomaly</li>
      <li>I recently ran out of scruples and could do absolutely nothing with my curls.  </li>
      <li>After a few uses it becomes very easy to use and lasts a very long time.</li>
      <li>It helps add so much volume to my hair and also helps hold my loose curls.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much of it for it will make your hair very dry.  </li>
      <li>The more I used this, the  worse the results.</li>
      <li>I think it gives me just the right needed texture to actually do something with my hair, without weighing it down.  </li>
      <li>I use a blob about the size of a half dollar, mounded up some, and it works very well.  </li>

    <li> I have been using this mousse for years.  It is absolutely the best product I have ever found for my natural curls.  I recently ran out of scruples and could do absolutely nothing with my curls.  The mousse controls the frizz which I fight all during our rainy winters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for straight hair, but it is MUST HAVE for naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> I normally use a gel just to help &#x27;control&#x27; my hair.  I really like this.  I does give my hair some added volume, but you can use too much of it.  You just have to figure out which is the right amount for you hair.</li>
    <li> What a great product.  Leaves your hair with tons of body and lift.  I have fine but thicker hair, cut chin length. After styling with the Creme Parfait and a curling brush my hair retains its style and more important increases in volume and bounce. Unlike many similiar products, Scruples leaves your hair clean feeling until the next shampoo.  No icky feeling dirty looking hair here. It is so hard to find, however.  None of the beauty supply stores have the product in my city and I have not seen it in salons either. HELLO.....YOU GUYS ARE MISSING OUT BIG TIME. Anyway, thank you Amazon for providing good customer service to we hair challenged people.</li>
    <li> This is a light styling foam that is perfect for giving bounce and body to fine hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and have never found a better product, regardless of price.</li>
    <li> Really like this product and have used for years.  Leaves hair with good body.  Does not weigh down hair and leaves hair soft to touch.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years. Love it.</li>
    <li> Best mousse out there, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Very light, but holds style well, whether you air dry or blow dry. Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34; like other products I&#x27;ve used in the past, so I don&#x27;t have to double cleanse all the time. The scent is nice too, very light, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with any perfume I might wear.</li>
    <li> Was really disappointed in this as it didn&#x27;t work any better than products costing far less. Very little, if any, &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit July 31, 2015: Changed to 1 star. The more I used this, the  worse the results. I tried different amounts, tried several of the suggestions in reviews but it seemed to actually make my hair look and feel worse each time used. It dries out my hair and makes it feel like straw. I&#x27;m completely baffled by all the positive reviews unless my experience is simply an anomaly or I happened to purchase one from a bad batch which seems unlikely with a hair product. I won&#x27;t be purchasing Scruples products in the future.</li>
    <li> I love it! It helps add so much volume to my hair and also helps hold my loose curls. It is my new favorite product.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair.  It works pretty good, not great, but good.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite hair product.  Helps my fine hair have a little more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;.  Hard to find around here so glad to see it offered on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for a long while. Never drying to the hair and works very well.</li>
    <li> It smells great and there NO sticky residue!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Helps add volume to fine hair.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this winner. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.there&#x27;s no need to over do it - just a palm&lt;br /&gt;full.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well and smells good and doesn&#x27;t get crunchy.</li>
    <li> This Scruples is just the right weight for my thinning hair.  It is easy to use and the style holds.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. N</li>
    <li> I have seriously fine, straight hair and this is the first product that has given me some real volume.  I think it gives me just the right needed texture to actually do something with my hair, without weighing it down.  I have tried every &amp;#34;volumizer&amp;#34; sold in stores, all to no avail.  This was the only salon product that I have every been recommended that I won&#x27;t go without.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Always gives a nice light aroma to your hair.My favorite by far. Gives your hair a nice hold but not too heavy to deal with styling hair.</li>
    <li> Good product and adds nice body with out weight.  It smells wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;Using it along with other scruples products.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the styling foam, styling get and hair spray in this brand and all of the products are exceptional!  Their hair spray is the ONLY spray I&#x27;ve EVER used that truly doesn&#x27;t build up on my hair.  And I use a lot because I have very fine hair.  Great quality products!!</li>
    <li> Best product on the markert</li>
    <li> This works better than any product I have used in the past. It really provides body and hold.</li>
    <li> I love all Scruples products, especially the hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin flyaway hair and this gives me much needed volume with good hold.&lt;br /&gt;I  like it and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> The item I received was in a black bottle-I was looking for the white bottle that was shown.</li>
    <li> Helps to give volume to my fine hair. No fragrance which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> Scruples is one of my favorite hair products.  Always works as I expect it too.  This one holds well without being stiff.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend who has been a long time user. She purchases it from our hair salon, but I decided to see if Amazon might carry it, so that I could get it for less money. As I thought, Amazon did have it at a much lower price than the salon, and it was delivered to my home in 2 days. This product definitely delivers on its promise of added body to my hair. In fact, the difference is quite amazing. I will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I love scruples products. This is a great mousse. Light weight, but great hold. Never flaky.</li>
    <li> would definitely recommend both vendor and product</li>
    <li> I love this product because I can still manage my hair with it in there and it smells very nice.</li>
    <li> Great for fine hair volume needs  Doesn&#x27;t weigh you down, or get gummy</li>
    <li> This is the best mouse I have ever used. It is not &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; like some---leaves my hair soft and shiny,smells good,and gives a good hold but not stiiff.I love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Best product for my fine hair.</li>
    <li> i have used Scruples on my hair for years. I love how it smells, it makes my hair shine and makes it so easy to blow dry and style. i love it!!!</li>
    <li> good volume....not sticky or tacky</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years.  It adds more body to my hair than any other I have tried.</li>
    <li> This mousse actually does make your hair look thicker. My only recommendation to those who might purchase this is to not put the mousse all over your head, but rather section your hair , and then blow dry each section. Seems if the mousse stays on too long before the blow-drying starts, it&#x27;s hard to get the brush through your hair and mousse becomes sticky</li>
    <li> Have been using scruples styling foam for over four years. Would never go back to any other product. It is the best and your hair styles so easy. Just love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  Gives hair volume and bounce, really smooth to put on. Does not leave your hair dry or brittle.</li>
    <li> Have not opened it yet, and it is in a black container (beauty shop I go to is still using the container pictured above).  I would give it a 5 star if I had used it and it is the same I&#x27;m used to, just hope the fragrance has not been changed too.  I can tolerate the fragrance of the beige can, and hope this one will be the same for I have severe allergies.  It would be better if I reviewed it later, but these cans last so long.&lt;br /&gt;7/10/14&lt;br /&gt;I finally got around to opening the Scruples Cr&amp;egrave;me Parfait Vol.Styling Foam, and using some of the product.  It is the same product that was in the beige can, and fragrance is the same.  I love this product for it gives my grey hair great body, and is so easy to style.  It does present a problem for me and may others as well.  It is hard to get a new can to work but it is worth it-needs a lot of shaking and follow the instructions with the tip of the can facing straight down, push very hard.  After a few uses it becomes very easy to use and lasts a very long time. Don&#x27;t use too much of it for it will make your hair very dry.  I use a blob about the size of a half dollar, mounded up some, and it works very well.  Makes my hair have a pretty shine also.</li>
    <li> I found this mousse to be average.  I bought it based on reviews that said it gave superior body and hold, but I don’t think it&#x27;s any better than regular drug store brands.  I went back to a product I’ve been happy with in the past -- Redken Guts 10 spray foam.  It’s a bit expensive ($17 at Walmart for 10.58 oz) but gives the best volume and hold I’ve found in a mousse.</li>
    <li> Great product give me the volume I need when styling my hair !</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance! It is a quality product and don&#x27;t need to apply much for optimum performance on your hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  It does a great job of providing body for thin, fine hair, which I have.</li>
