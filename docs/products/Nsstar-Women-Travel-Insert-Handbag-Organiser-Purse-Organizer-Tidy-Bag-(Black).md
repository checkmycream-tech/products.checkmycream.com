    <li> it was much bigger than I anticipated and there&#x27;s no real structure to it. When it is full, it&#x27;s a little too &#x27;squishy&#x27; to be really portable from one handbag to another. I have a organizer from another company that is sturdier and it is much easier to use for quick changes.</li>
    <li> I love this purse organizer. Lots of handy pockets on the outside, 2 roomy areas that zip with an open center area to handle all of your belongings. Makes finding things in a larger purse easy with no fumbling. Two loops on the top if you want to pick the whole thing up and move it another purse.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice accessory</li>
    <li> In general I really like this product though the one I received was defective. This is the second of these I have bought. The first one was great. On this one, one of the little handles pulled out the first time I used it. I think it was not sewn in well. I have asked the seller to replace it and will update/revise this review if that happens.</li>
    <li> Very useful, love all the compartments, the zipped enclosures and seems to be durable. Now I can easily transition from one purse to the other.</li>
    <li> Feel apart after only 2 months.</li>
    <li> I change my bags frequently.  This is one of the best things I&#x27;ve every purchased.  Has enough room and organizes more than it looks like in picture.  It is small, yet so much fits in it!</li>
    <li> The inside handles fell of quickly but other than that it has held up very well for the cost.</li>
    <li> This is just right for my sack purse. I can fill this up and still have room for my phone and wallet outside of the organizer. Some think it&#x27;s too small but I like the size. They must have a lot more in their purses than I do.</li>
    <li> This is awesome for keeping stuff organized in your purse.  I do not like having everything without a place in my handbags and this gives me a place for everything and makes it very easy to switch out purses.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but wow—this insert is a great tool for optimizing the space in a larger handbag! I can now find my phone and wallet consistently and quickly, which is a rare quality for anything that&#x27;s not an open tote bag. Very cool.</li>
    <li> bought it for a present and as far as I know she likes it.</li>
    <li> The zippers are difficult to open, so I can&#x27;t close them. The nylon is already tearing and I haven&#x27;t filled it or used it all that much. It would cost more to ship it back than the refund is worth, so I guess I&#x27;ll give to one of my nieces.</li>
    <li> More like another purse</li>
    <li> I can finally find all the &amp;#34;little things&amp;#34; in my purse.Light weight. Just bought a second one!</li>
    <li> Needs a more solid base, but I like that I can make it larger/smaller via side snaps</li>
    <li> I use it to organize my Filofax and supplies in my purse. Works great!</li>
    <li> I love this so much! I switch purses all the time and it makes it so easy! I&#x27;ve actually ordered another one for my mom and one for my gym bag!</li>
    <li> luv it.. wanna get more so I can share them with family..</li>
    <li> looks just as expected</li>
    <li> Lots of compartments. Lightweight.</li>
    <li> If you looking for a super high quality organizer, this not it. That being established, this is great for organization and if it falls apart, that is okay because it wasn&#x27;t that expensive. Does the job, but may only last for a couple years before it rips.</li>
    <li> This thing is genius! it is the perfect way to organize a large purse! shipped fast and exactly as described!</li>
    <li> very flimsy material.  seam on one side pulled out the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> this is so cheap , it reaped just as i took it out of the package. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> Great organizer for a backpack.</li>
    <li> After one use the handles started to come apart from he bag.  Not a very good quality.</li>
