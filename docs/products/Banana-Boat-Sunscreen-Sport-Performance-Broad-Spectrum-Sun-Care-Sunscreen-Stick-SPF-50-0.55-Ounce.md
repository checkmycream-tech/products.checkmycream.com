    <li> Beat the heck out of gooey cream, and avoids spraying ones face.</li>
    <li> Terrific product!  Works great!</li>
    <li> I use this stick to cover my tattoos while tanning. It&#x27;s easy to use, it goes on smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t run or spread like other sunscreen sticks I&#x27;ve tried. It has a very light &amp;#34;tropical &amp;#34;sent, and I&#x27;ve never had any issues with breakouts.</li>
    <li> I use these on my tattoos and it is easy to apply and convenient to just throw in a bag. Love.</li>
    <li> Seems to be doing okay.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to sunscreen lotion on your face.  I use this when swimming to avoid any run off into my eyes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sunblock in a stick, what more can I say?  It is effective, stays on well and lasts a long time, even in wet and sweaty conditions,as far as I can tell.  It also smells nice and isn&#x27;t greasy.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, so even though you don&#x27;t get a lot in a package, you also don&#x27;t use a lot either.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Easily applied to squirming kiddos! It&#x27;s hard to use the spray stuff without getting it in your eyes, and the lotion gets so runny, and makes a mess. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it all over as an adult, it wouldn&#x27;t be very efficient, but it&#x27;s by far the best for face application, hands down!</li>
    <li> I have used this twice and it failed twice.  I would have got more protection from a vat of hot grease and a bag of panko crumbs.  It was like wearing nothing at all.  Maybe I got a bad stick but either way I have suffered through two bad sunburns because I relied on this product.</li>
    <li> great product ok price</li>
    <li> Got burned.  I bought it for the convenience.  I think the normal Sports suncreen lotion perform much better.  This is better for reapplication on top of the lotion and not for use by itself.</li>
    <li> These sticks are the perfect thing to carry in a sports or handbag.  No mess to reapply, goes on just like chapstick.  Great for both kids and adults.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product on my face, but I have no complaints. It goes on super easy and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. And the best part is you don&#x27;t have to deal with a messy lotion!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen at a good price. Much cheaper than walmart/target</li>
    <li> This stick is perfect for your pocket or a small purse and a great way to apply sunscreen to your face and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a bit greasier than I expected though and became really soft in the outdoor heat.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as packaged. I use this to easily cover my tattoos when I want to tan.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is perfect to throw in your purse or bag when you need it on the go. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, and there are no dyes, so allergic reactions are at a minimum.

    <li> Seems like the stick does the trick as far as sun protection, I used it mainly on my lips as they often burn and cause me to get sun blisters. The only con was a funky after taste if you get some in your mouth but nothing major.</li>
    <li> Used it on vacation; just fine.</li>
    <li> Great product, Excelent Service</li>
    <li> Great to use on the kids faces.</li>
    <li> The seller is fine, the product is not so good.  Very hard to use this on a childs face.  For grownups it may be just fine.</li>
    <li> The convenience of a stick is fantastic! It did a very good job of protecting my face (and I have pale skin that burns easily.) The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was it felt kind of greasy or gross on my face. It might be in part that my skin is oily though.</li>
    <li> Love the sun stick, easy to apply to face and neck. Perfect for kids</li>
    <li> Item did not protect from sun at all. I put this on my son&#x27;s face on the pool site and at the end of the day he had a badly sunburnt face. Won&#x27;t use it again</li>
    <li> I used this Banana Boat Stick last year. I could not find it this year anywhere except here. It works great. I use it on my face and keep it in my pocket. I have had good skin check-ups since I have been using it.</li>
