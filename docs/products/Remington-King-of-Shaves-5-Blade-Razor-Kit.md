      <li>One of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used was a Bic single-razor model made in Greece.</li>

      <li>I loved the no tilt handle - perfect in the shower.</li>

      <li>If this razor can do a great job on my face it can do a great job on any face.</li>

      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>The blade will either fly off, or the handle will fall apart.  </li>
      <li>I bought a razor and 15 Cartridges for around $13 and was so happy about the deal I got.</li>
      <li>While it does a great job of providing a close shave, this razor has it&#x27;s share of issues.  </li>
      <li>Feels great in your hand.</li>
      <li>This razor was great.</li>
      <li>Great blade.</li>
      <li>but this razor provides the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
      <li>Great, close shave, no irritation.</li>
      <li>It looks and feels very nice and sleek.</li>
      <li>VERY CLOSE  !!!!!!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I almost did too!  </li>
      <li>The Fusion ProGlide blades cost so much more, but the razor is the best.  </li>
      <li>now that is unique!!!  </li>
      <li>It might be a good razor if you have NEVER used a BIC disposable razor before.</li>
      <li>A good effort though.</li>
      <li>Not even a good one.</li>
      <li>for shaving, it does a good job in that regard.  </li>
      <li>Now that is a good razor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, comparing the King Of Shaves to the Gillette Proglide isn&#x27;t a fair comparison.  </li>
      <li>Its a quality handle with good</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good looking.</li>
      <li>the blades while awesome also seem to be cheaply made somehow.  </li>
      <li>for a ridiculously good price.  </li>
      <li>you can get a good deal on it, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
      <li>As a result it would never get a good close shave anywhere on my face.</li>
      <li>Good razor.  </li>
      <li>review may be biased because I got this as a really good deal on Woot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t paid attention to pricing, so it may be a good value from that perspective.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a good one and</li>
      <li>but once you do you will find that it&#x27;s superior.</li>
      <li>The rubbery grip of the razor is good and serves the purpose.</li>
      <li>The Good --  </li>
      <li>This is a good one for me.</li>
      <li>2 were good.</li>
      <li>That said, I don&#x27;t need a super-duper shaver to get a good close shave.</li>
      <li>The tension created when you press the handle against skin is fair but it is so flexible that it bends when it shouldn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no denying the cost-per-blade savings of this razor, and I will not condemn it as a \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Still, it is a good product, and I will use up all the cartridges that came with it.  </li>
      <li>I figured I would be good for a couple years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>That bulky \\&quot;bumper\\&quot; gets in the way and prevents me from getting good blade contact.  </li>
      <li>This razor is unique but not the best.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that this razor provided the closest shave that I ever experienced, but for the price, it&#x27;s quite respectable.</li>
      <li>Works great,  this shaver is much better then any others I have used before and way cheaper.  </li>
      <li>I love the shave and the price!  </li>
      <li>The \\&quot;handle\\&quot; feels good in hand, is lightweight, and is easy to, well, handle!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Surround Sound speakers have been undoubtedly a great improvement, but trying to place them is a pain.</li>
      <li>Over all it is a wonderful design, a more natural grip and a great razor.</li>
      <li>Smooth shaving great price.</li>
      <li>When I used it, it was the equivalent of using one of those dollar store razor packages the kind you get 5 razors for a dollar.  </li>
      <li>I liked the sleek design of this razor.</li>
      <li>but he has really liked it.</li>
      <li>I think this is the best razor I have ever paid too much for.</li>
      <li>And to be totally honest</li>
      <li>This razor also cannot cut the chin area or neck area effectively.  </li>
      <li>Price is nice.  </li>
      <li>I honestly need five blades?\\&quot;    </li>
      <li>Gave to Girlfriend to see if she liked it</li>
      <li>Blades don&#x27;t clog if you keep another tooth brush handy.</li>
      <li>Have not EVER cut or nicked myself with it, which is a nice change.  </li>
      <li>Just my own experience</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of fancy and seems festooned with some....</li>
      <li>The five blade cartridge seems nice, but, probably because of the handle and the shaving angle, I don&#x27;t get as close a shave as I would like.</li>
      <li>value-priced replacements are nice though.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Right away I thought this shaver just felt &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; as I attempted to get my regular close shave.  Not only did I feel like I was not getting the usual &amp;#34;feedback&amp;#34; from razor on skin to hand, I was not receiving an evenly close and smooth shave.  Why anyone would attempt to save a few bucks favoring this over the initially more expensive Schick Hydro is beyond me.  Especially since I feel sure the Schick would not only provide a vastly superior shave, but would do so for a longer time, I believe, because of superior steel, honing, and design.</li>
    <li> Let me preface my review with this little tidbit: I have very little facial hair to shave. I can go three days without shaving to have the same amount of facial hair as \\&quot;most\\&quot; men have at the end of the work day. That said, I don&#x27;t need a super-duper shaver to get a good close shave. In fact, a regular two or three blade razor generally lasts 6-9 months for me. I found a deal for the Remington King of Shaves razor and refills on Woot and thought that it would give me a great shave and last me the rest of my life! But NO! The design of the blade is such that even my wimpy little hairs don&#x27;t get cut close unless I scrape my face three or four times. And even then, with a fresh new blade, it tugs at my skin and hair as if it were three months old. I tried to make them work and suffered for three months, changing the blade every month because I thought something was wrong with each one. Then one day I was on a trip and need a razor so I bought a $2.59 pack of 5 double-bladed disposables. The first shave with one of those throwaway blades was sheer joy! I got the closest shave I&#x27;ve had since before the \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; and immediately boxed the handle and all the unused blades to donate to charity. DO NOT BUY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW; besides the terrible shave, the blade falls off the handle very easily when you try to tap out hairs and shaving cream and the design makes it impossible to get up close under your nose.</li>
    <li> I have tried the new Remington King of Shaves Razor and it is Amazing!!!  It is sleek, so easy to use, and there is a grip strip on the underneath and on the top side, so it wont slip out of your hand....... now that is unique!!!  It will prevent cuts and dropping the razor so many times, we have all done it.  This Razor has the most unique head on it, it is flexable for comfort and ease of use.  I have never seen anything like it, you have to check it out!  It has a strip of rubber as to protect your skin and the whole experience of shaving is just like WOW!!!  Someone finally got a Razor right!!!  Try it out, you wont be disapointed but pleasantly surprised, like I was.  Go Reimington King of Shaves!!!!</li>
    <li> As I pulled the Azor 5 razor from its packaging I immediately saw its potential to tame the roughest of hairy areas.  The finger loop offers the kind of leverage I need to maneuver and groom those tough to reach areas, while the flexible head makes every stroke as smooth as butter.  The 5 finely honed blades attached to the sleek chrome handle with its high performance grip will make every hair on your face strike out at the plate leaving nothing but silky smooth, touchable man-turf. The Azor 5 Razor swiftly delivers the King of shaves, time after time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a King of Shaves customer for some time now, but have tried both the Gillette Fusion and Schick Hydro 5 razors to see what the 5 blades were all about.  I&#x27;ve got to admit I liked them and chafed at being unable to get the Azor 5 in the USA.    I received my Azor 5 from Amazon yesterday and WOW!  I love the shave and the price!  It&#x27;s an awesome product.  I now have the best, I don&#x27;t need the rest!    Give the Azor 5 with one of the King of Shaves oils a try, you won&#x27;t go back to your old system.</li>
    <li> The five blades make this razor too big to get every part of my face. The blades are too close together and it gets clogged easily. The flex on the upper joint gives too much and I can&#x27;t get the proper pressure behind it to get a good shave. I had good results on the flat parts of my face and neck, but had to use my Mach3 to get my chin and under my nose. This razor may be ok for some, but it does not meet my needs.</li>
    <li> There is so much advertising that goes into the usual brands of manual shavers, so I was skeptical about this one.  But when I used it for the first time, I was pleasantly suprised. Remington has exceptional electric razors but this manual one is even better. The price is right and shave is fantastic---can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a regular Gillette Fusion user and thought I&#x27;d try this shaver out. It&#x27;s inexpensive and the photo depicts a razor with a sleek design.    However, it&#x27;s this very design that restricts this product from achieving what I want from a shaver - a clean shave.   The problem lies not in the blade but in the the shaver itself. Where the blade connects to the shaver, there is no tilt action. It glides on one plane which makes it impractical to follow the curves under your jaw line, Adam&#x27;s apple, chin and lip area.  I tried again yesterday, applying slightly more pressure pulling up and down with painstaking accuracy. Regrettably, this shaver has been a time consuming and frustrating product that has left me with poor results. I won&#x27;t be using this shaver again and strongly recommend not buying this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over thirty years, and feel as though I&#x27;ve tried just about every possible razor out there.  Some work well, others not so well, but most are average.  I have a tough beard, and fast growing at that.  Back in military basic training, I had to shave two to three times per day to pass inspections.  I had pretty much stuck with the Mach 3 blades until the Fusion blades came out, and I find I get a better shave with the Fusion blades, albeit slightly better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor on a gold box deal, and for the price, I felt it was worth a try.  The blades are better than a disposable razor blade, but I don&#x27;t feel they are up to the Fusion blades, as I&#x27;ve gone back and forth between the two, and find a better shave from the Fusion blades.  The design takes a bit of a time to get used to.  Pressing too hard is counterproductive with the design, but I find I have to hit most areas two or three times to get all of the hair.  If you don&#x27;t have a tough beard you may find these blades are more comparable.  I debated on whether this was a three star or a four star rating, and went with the four star, as the pros outweighted the cons...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  - Great Price (Much cheaper than the competition)&lt;br /&gt;  - Good Shave (After learning how to use the razor)&lt;br /&gt;  - Quality in razor handle seems good&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  - Learning curve in use (not sure it really is a better way to shave)&lt;br /&gt;  - Average blades (I feel they will need replacing more often than slightly higher priced blades)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone willing to try new razor blades and ideas.  Although it might do well for some, I don&#x27;t see this razor as the shape of razors in the future.  I expect that Remington will improve on this idea in the near future, hopefully keeping the price level the same.</li>
    <li> I hate these things so much , I decided to do my 1st review, just to save somebody the money.  Problems:  Weird holder that does not support the blade well  Blades dull after 1 use and it really doesn&#x27;t do well the first use either. I use a disposable blade to touch up the missed areas that still have wiskers after several passes with this blade.  Even harder than most to attach and detach the blades  I don&#x27;t care how cheap they are they are worthless to me.  Cheap disposables work better.  I can&#x27;t believe anybody uses these things.</li>
    <li> The biggest design flaw here is that due to the shape, it doesn&#x27;t reach the upper lip (under the nose), or any other \\&quot;tight\\&quot; spot. I literally have to get out another razor to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I initially looked at the product online, and even out of the box, I assumed the neck would be flexible enough to turn corners, etc. It is not - it&#x27;s a fairly firm piece of silicone. And it lacks a trimmer blade on top, so there&#x27;s no way to do \\&quot;trim\\&quot; work using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I liked every other aspect of the razor. Close shave, easy to use, no cuts. In  my book, it&#x27;s probably comparable to Gillette Fusion except for that one issue. It might actually be a more comfortable shave (less razor burn), and the replacement blades are less expensive, but I won&#x27;t be buying them.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this razor to work. I have used King of Shaves shaving gel for a long time now and loved it. Plus the blades are properly priced compared to really everyone else. But this is literally the worst razor I have ever used. On my first shave the blades got clogged with hair that would not come out after rinsing. A few times I have had to clean it out with a clothes pin because the hair got so stuck in there. Secondly, the shave is wildly uneven. While it is pretty good at convex surfaces like the corner of the mouth, it is terrible at concave areas like the neck. So long as I have used it, the only way to get an even neck shave is to shave against the grain or clean up with another razor. Lastly, their \\&quot;Endurium\\&quot; coated blades are extremely cheap themselves. With a name based in science fiction rather than science, I have already gone through the provided 3 heads after only 5 shaves. Granted I grow a little scruff between shaves, but never more than two days worth and my hair is not very thick at all.  I was a sucker and bought a refill of heads, never thinking that a razor could be this bad. I am going to try to shave more regularly with them, and hopefully they will fair better. If I find them more useful, I will return to revise my review, but until then, don&#x27;t believe the hype. The reason this razor is so inexpensive is because it is cheap.</li>
    <li> Upon starting a new job, shaving became a requirement in my daily routine.  This razor gives a great shave, lacking nothing but irritation!  I definitely recommend to anyone that shaves daily.  Extremely comfortable, and affordable!</li>
    <li> Every time I log on Amazon to buy new blades, (which is very very rarely since they last forever it seems) I happen to glance at all these reviews.  I don&#x27;t write reviews, but I feel as a man who shaves against the grain, I should help my fellow men out.  Here&#x27;s the real deal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I shave in the shower, so this review is based on that experience.  I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a little over 2 years, so listen to me, not these people who tried it once and decided to give it a bad review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st, the razor is extremely odd and uncomfortable to hold and use the first few, nay the first ten or so times you will use it.  DON&#x27;T GIVE UP!  the reason it FEELS ODD is that it&#x27;s different from everything else you&#x27;ve ever used.  However, much like when you buy a new car and everything feels different and odd and you don&#x27;t know quite where everything is, after a while it becomes second nature and you&#x27;re back to normal!  Trust me, after a while, you may go back to try whatever new fusion ball bearing vibrating nick the hell out of your face contraption they&#x27;ve made up for 100 dollars and 10 dollars per blade and then THAT will feel ever more odd than your KOS razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)  it&#x27;s smooth.  Very smooth.  Super duper smooth.  The blades will glide across your face like butter, and for a LONG TIME.&lt;br /&gt;2) as mentioned, the blades stay smooth and sharp for much much longer than anything you&#x27;ve ever used.  I literally only change the blades every month.  That&#x27;s right, FOUR WEEKS PER BLADE!  You&#x27;re mileage may vary, but remember, I shave AGAINST THE GRAIN.&lt;br /&gt;3) once you get used to it, you will be able to shave the exact same places you always have.  Some places may and do require a ninja-like grip, but again, you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;4) people don&#x27;t like it!  Yes, they are not popular!  Why is that a pro?  Well look at the price.  The razor and the blades are dirt fricken cheap!  Pair that with how long they last and you will save truck loads of money on shaving every year.  I was spending what like 50 bucks a month on razors, now I spend maybe 80 bucks a YEAR on them, if that.  I don&#x27;t even know anymore that&#x27;s how rarely I have to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;5) did I mention how sharp and smooth the blades are and stay?  Note:  this sounds odd, but the very first shave may feel a tiny bit rough and may be a tiny bit nicky.  It&#x27;s weird and I don&#x27;t know why, but after the first couple of shaves it just starts to glide across stubble like it&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s business.&lt;br /&gt;6)  no irritation.  Yup none.  OK maybe at first while your skin adjusts to it you might get a little, but that will be more because you are having to take so many swipes as you get accustomed to using it.&lt;br /&gt;7)  you will never get nicked and cut again. Even after 4 weeks you won&#x27;t get cut.  You will change the razor out of boredom before you change it because of dullness.  You&#x27;ll change it because of rust too, which leads me too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) the shape.  Yes I said it&#x27;s OK, but it is a con still, because people do get frustrated and stop using it after the first try.  Honestly, I almost did too!  But the sheer amount of money that I saw myself saving made me soldier on.  And boy I&#x27;m glad I did.  The place right under your nose is especially difficult to reach, but you will develop that ninja grip and you will get it just fine.  It&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t get it, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s hard to do.  Even after you get used to it, it&#x27;s still tough to get.  But it&#x27;s fine because as I said the irritation is next to nill even if you have to go over and over and over it.&lt;br /&gt;2) this one is gross.  The handle itself is made of some cheap plastic/rubber combination.  After a while, if you leave it in the shower as I do, it will grow mold.  Yep mold.  It&#x27;s not stainless steel.  But that took a year for me.  Oh well the razor is ten bucks, so buy another one and get 3 more blades along with it.  Done and done.&lt;br /&gt;3) the blades while awesome also seem to be cheaply made somehow.  (like not 100% stainless steel or something)  They WILL RUST.  You will change the blades because of rust before you change it before of dulling.&lt;br /&gt;4)  the rest of the KOS line is not impressive.  the gel, while great and unusual, is pretty not cheap and you get very little of it.  You will have to get another brand&#x27;s products to shave with.  I have found a foam to be a lot better to use with this razor than a gel.  Just IMHO&lt;br /&gt;5) some spots on your face just will not cooperate with this razor.  Your face is different from mine to be sure, but there are some spots I still struggle with.  By struggle I mean I have to go over and over them.  Your mileage may vary.  BUT you will very rarely ever get cut!  Go ahead, try to do it I dare you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok that&#x27;s it.  Yes there are some cons, but so do the rest of the choices on the market.  Gillette fusion razors will cut your face into a million tiny pieces and bankrupt you while doing it.  Trust me this thing is awesome.  Buy it, and give it a month.  If you don&#x27;t like it you are out 10 bucks.  But you HAVE TO GIVE IT A CHANCE.  A REAL, HONEST CHANCE.  don&#x27;t be a goof and be like ADD idiots and give up after one attempt.  Please.  There is no reason to pay an obscene amount of money for tiny little razor blades.  And razors that vibrate and dance and do retarded little gimmicks and everything OTHER than give you a smooth shave.  Nobody should put a battery into a freakin razor.  I mean wow.eaply made somehow.  (like not 100% stainless steel or something)  They WILL RUST.  You will change the blades because of rust before you change it before of dulling.&lt;br /&gt;4)  the rest of the KOS line is not impressive.  the gel, while great and unusual, is pretty not cheap and you get very little of it.

    <li> it&#x27;s inexpensive and they get dull after the first use. I use them as disposable and once I&#x27;m done with all the cartridges I&#x27;m switching back to Shick.</li>
    <li> When I went to open these razors, I was immediately pleased at how easy the packaging was to take apart. That is exactly where the pleasure ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the cartridge onto the blade was ridiculous enough. The cartridge was well set into the clear plastic cartridge tray, and the razor didn&#x27;t have enough grip to pull it out once attached. So, every time I go to put on a new razor (which is painfully frequent), I have to spend time fiddling with the cartridge to make sure it&#x27;s not going to fall off mid-shave. I&#x27;m used to the Gillette 5+1 blade razors where you just pop one off, pop one on, and get to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally got to shave, I was impressed at how crappy of a shave I got. Even going against the grain it looked like I had a 3:00 shadow going. So, even though it looks like you don&#x27;t shave, you can&#x27;t get away with skipping a day with these junk razors. If you do, the first swipe will leave a bunch of hair stuck between the blades. Then, you&#x27;ll either have to pick it out, rinse it for hours, or grab a new razor. This is in contrast to the Gillette razors, whose 4-blade variety can even take off several days of hair with one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors are a complete pain to work with. Avoid. I bought a ton on woot.com because they were cheap, adding up in my mind how much money I would save with a supposed year&#x27;s supply of razors for the cost of a month of Gillette product. Unfortunately, though, they quickly get stuck full of hair or fall off onto the floor, needing replacement. If you are lucky enough to use one of these cartridges until the end of it&#x27;s life, it actually isn&#x27;t that impressive because the thing will be dull in just a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is crap.</li>
    <li> Great razor and cartridges.  No nicks or cuts and glided right over the skin.  I highly recommend this razor and these cartridges!  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I like this razor. I am prone to cutting myself when shaving, but I finish without cuts with this razor. The closeness of the shave is okay. The shape and positioning is different and seems weird at first, but it feels comfortable and natural to hold and use. I also like the design of the pivoting head and how it contours easily to the face. I would recommend this razor to others.</li>
    <li> I recently thought I would try out a new razor.  Well, this one is great!  It is extremely smooth, and there is basically no chance of getting nicks or cuts.  The five blades are efficient at getting a close shave.  The only problem with the razor is that it is pretty flimsy at the rubber bending part.  I would prefer a slightly more stiff razor.  But overall, it&#x27;s a great razor that I plan to use in the future!</li>
    <li> The flexible head is way too flexible. I can&#x27;t get a close shave unless I press on the back of the blade cartridge with my fingers.</li>
    <li> It does shave quite closely and without nicks.  It&#x27;s design is hard to get used to.  The head tends to float like the disks of rotary electric shavers because the head&#x27;s attachment to the handle is not fixed...it bends back the more you press it against your face as you would typically do with standard fixed-head stiff models.  Although I&#x27;ve only used it twice to date I can see how this would reduce the blood letting.  This design is quite unique and deserves it&#x27;s trial in the court of public consumerism.</li>
    <li> WILL not hold blades, WILL NOT shave , already in the trash, worst product Ive every Purcahse from Amazon or WOOT and That&#x27;s a lot MAYBE THE  WORST IVE PURCHASE IN 50 YEARS, NO THAT WAS A MERCURY COUGAR I PURCHASED IN 1977, BUT VERY CLOSE  !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Top-notch shave, but has a few minor cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It does give a very close shave.  Slightly closer than my Gillette Mach 3 manual multi-blade shaver (I&#x27;ll refer to it as the GM3 below).&lt;br /&gt;-It seems to have a slight advantage over accidentally cutting yourself near \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot; spots compared to the GM3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The head doesn&#x27;t flex as much as the GM3 multi-blade shaver, so you have to be more focused on getting into curved areas.  Is a bit awkward to hold and use, but not overly so.&lt;br /&gt;-It seems to clog at the end of its life quicker than my GM3 (or multi-blade shavers in its class).  Because of this, its life span is slightly less.  If my GM3 shaver can be used for approximately 30 shaves, this one is maybe 20. (I didn&#x27;t count the number of shaves - this is just an example).&lt;br /&gt;-Changing blades is not quite as intuitive as the Gillette Mach 3.  Not a huge problem, but at 6AM, you don&#x27;t want to think that much.</li>
    <li> I was given this razor to review and I have to say I really like it.  It gave me a smooth shave and was easy to use.  I love the flexible head and it glided over legs very fast and easy.  I did not get any cuts from using this razor. I suggest you give this razor a try. :)</li>
    <li> I have shaved with the Remington King of Shaves Azor 5 several times over nearly the last week, after shaving with some incarnation of a Gillette (Sensor, Sensor Excel, Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo) for over 20 years.  Of course, I must compare them.  Of course, the cost of the Remington replacement cartridges cost signficantly less than Gillette replacements, if you want a 5-blade cartridge.  I have found no significant improvement in shave quality or comfort between the Remington and my Mach 3 cartridges.  Both are quite comfortable.  If the Remington is closer, as many claim, it is only slightly so (imperceptable, as far as I can tell).  Since the Mach 3 replacements are roughly the same price, per unit, as the Remington, I find little advantage on the raw cost.  It does seem that Remington blades may last a little longer, so there could be some savings, there, but we are talking something on the order of $0.50/week or less.  However, I have found a significant difference in handling the Remington.  The initially awkward \\&quot;s-flex\\&quot; is rather easy to get used to.  I was comfortable with it by the end of the second shave and find it somewhat pleasant.  However. the razor is quite bulky, nearly an inch longer than the Gillette.  The blade cartridge also is roughly twice as wide (from top to bottom) as the Mach 3, and that makes it far less nimble.  I&#x27;ve found it difficult to get a close shave around certain tricky areas of my face, such as the corners of my mouth and nose.  That bulky \\&quot;bumper\\&quot; gets in the way and prevents me from getting good blade contact.  That is a real problem.  Also, I tend to hold a razor by the sides, which are very slick.  The gripping material is only on the front and back of the handle, but even that material is fairly slick when wet.  My Gillette, on the other hand, has knurled rubber areas all around the front, back, and sides.  It is much easier to hold onto when wet.  On balance, so far, I think I will stick with the Gillette.  The small cost savings from the Remington just are not enough to make up for the handling problems.  Having used a Gillette for so long, there is no doubt that I am biased, but I am not sure that mere skill and familiarity are the issue.  The design of the Remington just doesn&#x27;t fit my face.  Still, it is a good product, and I will use up all the cartridges that came with it.  Had I never used anything else, I probably would be raving about it.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best razor I have ever paid too much for. And that&#x27;s all of them. Great, close shave, no irritation.</li>
    <li> This is best looking razor I&#x27;ve seen.  The combination of the white, blue, and steel makes for an upscale appearance.  Even my wife commented on the attractiveness.  Of course, performance is the important criteria here and I found that this razor did not rival my normal razor, the Gillette Fusion ProGlide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The width of this razor is not as big as the Fusion, so that meant more required strokes.  Also, I didn&#x27;t care for the flex hinge.  It is highly flexible, which took some getting used to.  While the flexibility helped with shaving the neck area, it was a hindrance when shaving my sideburns and cheeks.  When shaving those areas, it&#x27;s better to have a razor head that stays sturdy instead of bending back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value-priced replacements are nice though.  Overall, I would rate it 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with this razor for two weeks now, so my face has adjusted and I&#x27;ve had enough exposure to make a fair review. There are two major points to this review:  * The Remington King of Shaves Azor 5 doesn&#x27;t cut as close as the competition  * Remington charges less for refills  If you can live with 95% of the performance at 60% of the price, then this razor is for you.</li>
    <li> The first thing your going to notice is that the Azor is not your typical razor.  Holding it in your hand feels very different than other razors.  It&#x27;s almost if the design is backward.  This is not a negative, but a minor adjustment you&#x27;ll have to make while shaving.  The five blades are flanked by lubricating strip and a rubber pivoting base.  I found that this rubber pivoting mechanism is better than the standard \\&quot;tilting\\&quot; blade.  Shaving my chin was easier and smoother.  The overall shave was good, but I&#x27;ve had closer shaves.  The blades sharpness lasts for a while.  However, changing the blade can be a pain because of it&#x27;s unique design.  I highly recommend pairing this razor up with Remington&#x27;s Alphagel for the best possible shave with the Azor.</li>
    <li> I have gorilla beard syndrome, blade needs to be super sharp ideally one of those multi blade things and I wear them out quickly.  I find this shaver to be useful in a pinch but will not replace my day to day razor.  The handle is a little too small or skinny for my hands and the blades are not as super-sharp and able to hold up to my face as some other razors.  For those without my particular issue this may well be a good product.</li>
    <li> Not much more to say than the other 350+ ppl stated already. Great razor, good price, took a little practice to get used to the new angle, I will be using this from now on. Maybe it won&#x27;t shave as close on some types of skin/hair. Works perfect for me. The only thing that hasn&#x27;t been mentioned is that the product line has never \\&quot;and will never\\&quot; be tested on animals according to the founder. After watching a short video at an eco fair about Gilette and other brands doing some sick stuff to animals I wanted to throw up. Those images can give you nightmares. I&#x27;ll never watch another video like that but it did make me want to support a company like this who doesn&#x27;t ever do crap like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s called a conscience, with no sacrifce of convenience &amp; quality.</li>
    <li> This razor threw me for a loop when I first opened the box. The design is somewhat of a reverse of what a traditional razor would be. When I hold a traditional razor, my index finger rests on that bump/angle at the top of the handle. On the Azor, the design is flipped and there is now not only a dip, but that large u shaped opening and my fingers now have a secure grip to simply glide it across my skin. The blade head is mounted on a rubber base that allows for true flexibility. Over all it is a wonderful design, a more natural grip and a great razor.</li>
    <li> I have used almost every razor available over the years. This is the very worst. It does not come close to the quality of the Gillette Proglide or the Schick Hydro five (which is the best). Also, it does  not have a trimmer for sideburns and under the nose. It&#x27;s a rough shave in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> I intially bought this razor because I thought it would be a good razor at a more decent price than my Gillette Proglide.  Well, I looked the razor up here at Amazon and read the reviews.  Mostly either people liked it completely hated it since the head is entirely opposite of a traditional razor.  I figured I&#x27;d at least try it to see if it had the remote possibility of being as good as the Proglide at a much more cost effective price(for the razor itself and the replacement heads).  So, I went to my local Walgreens and noticed they carried this item, then I decided to buy it and give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the King Of Shaves for a couple of weeks now, I gotta say I am a bit disappointed in it.  While it does a great job of providing a close shave, this razor has it&#x27;s share of issues.  First, the odd design of the head makes it nearly impossible to keep the head on.  This design is even more defective when the head holds hair badly and trying to knock the razor against the sink will only result in the flimsy head falling off.  Since I have a tough beard, it&#x27;s a chore to keep the hair out of the head without it coming completely off and having to stop and reattach it.  And secondly, contrary to Remington&#x27;s claims of the head lasting longer than it&#x27;s competitors(Proglide in my case), the head works for about 3-4 shaves(which is about what I get out of the Proglide).  The last gripe I have with the razor is it cannot line or maintain the line on your facial hair.  The few weeks I&#x27;ve used it, it hasn&#x27;t lined my goatee well or even lined my sideburns straightly.  All areas where the Gillette Proglide is superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, comparing the King Of Shaves to the Gillette Proglide isn&#x27;t a fair comparison.  While the Remington can provide an equally close shave, it cannot do most everything else the Proglide Styler I currently own can.  I&#x27;m sure if most guys like me wanted to know if the King Of Shave could replace the Proglide at a better cost, well it certainly can&#x27;t.  I guess in this instance, paying a few dollars more for the Proglide replacement heads is well worth it.  Too bad, cause if the minor problems with this razor were addressed, it could gain Remington some of Gillette&#x27;s consumer base(probably several million dollars).  Unfortunately, it appears as if they&#x27;d rather cut the production cost and make an inferior product to Gillette.rtainly can&#x27;t.

    <li> So I picked this up as an alternative to the extremely expensive Fusion I&#x27;ve been using happily for a few years.  Even at $9 for the handle and 3 blades this thing is a ripoff.  Every shave the blade falls off the handle.  It clogs, it tugs at my face.  Bottom line it is a horrible design.  I&#x27;m pitching the unused blades and going back to the Fusion for the time being.  The handle is too bulky as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using King Razors for over 5 years, so when the new 5 blade came out I thought I&#x27;d give them a try. Very Disappointing!! The Gaps between the blades constantly block and reduces the shaving abilities. The only way to stop this is to use an old tooth-brush to clean out the trapped hair between the blades...NOT GOOD!!</li>
    <li> The Remington King of Shaves AZOR 5 5-Blade Razor has a unique approach to the pivot allowing the blades to adjust facial contour.  Rather than a central fixed pivot, the \\&quot;soft-flex hinge\\&quot; has flexible material at each edge of the wishbone shaped handle.  The independent flexible \\&quot;skin stretcher\\&quot; below the blades in combination with the hinge action initially gave the false impression that the blades and cartridge itself were flexible.  Not so, although that would be interesting, too.    However, all this flexibility has its drawbacks.  It is not enough to have the blades adjust to facial contour - you need to apply enough pressure to effectively shave.  Over a period of time, this application of pressure deforms/slightly stretches the hinges progressively until you find yourself shaving with the blades at a 90° angle from the handle.  Since I only shave above and below a full beard and mustache, I can imagine that those with heavy beards who shave fully will find this product useless for their purposes.  Since the flexible hinges are on the handle itself, not the replacement cartridges, I presume many will need to replace the handle with some regularity because of stretched out hinges.  I also found the blade cartridge quality inconsistent.  One cartridge was essentially ineffective, the next reasonably good.    Overall, I have reluctantly returned to the shavers I previously used, but continue to hope for a shaving system then is effective for my needs without confiscatory replacement cartridge pricing (Gillette, I&#x27;m talking to you).</li>
    <li> This razor is pretty far from being the \\&quot;King of Shaves.\\&quot;  It gave a decent, but not great, shave.  I found the shaving angle a little awkward to use..  The more angled heads on other shavers seem easier to use -- although that may be partly because I am used to them.  This shaver also lacks the trimmer blade at the top that is useful for evening out sideburns and getting at whiskers around the nose that may otherwise be difficult to reach.  So, having given this razor a shot, I&#x27;m back to the Gillette ProGlide.</li>
    <li> This thing is awful. It&#x27;s OK when you shave with the grain, and absolutely worthless when shaving against. The handle makes it extremely awkward to hold, and the blade itself does not glide like a razor should. There is a LOT of resistance and the blades get way too close to the skin. So much so that it felt as if I was going to cut myself at any moment while trying to shave. In addition, this razor has absolutely no hydration whatsoever. Even the cheapo walmart razors have hydrating goo. I bought this on a whim because it is from a brand I trust and had a new design, but I made a mistake. I will never use this razor again. I&#x27;m going to stick with my Schick Hydro. Now that is a good razor.</li>
    <li> There are so many types and styles of razors it is amazing.  I&#x27;m not sure if any one style is better or worse because everyone&#x27;s skin is different and everyone has their own personal preference.  Here&#x27;s what I found using the King Of Shaves:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is definitely different, it takes a while to get used to using it.&lt;br /&gt;2. I don&#x27;t think it shaves any closer that most other blades&lt;br /&gt;3. I think the design is a bit awkward for the face but it looks much more suitable for the legs&lt;br /&gt;4. The cost of the replacement blades is very low (don&#x27;t they know that&#x27;s where the profits are made?)&lt;br /&gt;5. It is definitely not a cheap piece of plastic. Well made and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because shaving is such a personal experience I would recommend buying one.  It comes with 3 cartridges. If you hate it, you haven&#x27;t spent much trying it out. If you love it, you can be reasonably assured you will still be able to buy replacement blades, at least for a while, because it is made by Remington.</li>
    <li> I was recently able to get my hands on this razor for my boyfriend who uses different razors rather frequently in the hopes of finding the \\&quot;one.\\&quot;  His description after using it twice in 7 days was that it gave a close shave, however, was not great for lining if you still wish to have facial hair or sideburns.  He did state that while most will not use this for overall lining, he still found it more difficult when using around his bearded area.  Overall, he felt that it gave a very close shave without needing to repeat over sections as he has had to do with other razors.</li>
    <li> My impression is overall great of this 5 blade product.The blades are very sharp,and very precise..I am happy to use it and will be replacing my old one for sure!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a defective razor, because the locking clips on the razor appear to be damaged. Due to this, the razor does not hold the cartridge firmly. This is very dangerous.    The rubbery grip of the razor is good and serves the purpose. The neck of the razor has a nice flexible design too.    The cartridges are good, but I didn&#x27;t get a clean shave because the locking mechanism of the razor was defective.</li>
    <li> So the first thing I noticed after I took the razor out was how different it was from other razors I&#x27;ve had.  The head has two bendy sections right before the razor, which creates a very different feel when you&#x27;re using it.  It takes some getting used to, but overall I think it&#x27;s a very comfortable way to shave.  The extra blade gives me a noticeably closer shave, and the bending neck helped to reduce nicks and cuts.     Overall I would recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for something new out of your razor.</li>
    <li> This razor was great. Very close shave, no nicks or cuts when shaving. The curvature of the item is fantastic and really makes holding it a breeze. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this razor!</li>
    <li> One of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used was a Bic single-razor model made in Greece. One day they suddenly vanished from the shelves of my local drug store and I forgot about them until my wife and I toured Greece in 1995. Upon our return from the plains of Marathon, we saw the Bic factory and I recalled the black and white Bic Mens Metal Guard Shaver I liked so well. So when I got back to the U.S., I found some and ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using them, I&#x27;ve been using them ever since. They require a bit more care when you first try them, but they&#x27;re great. I realized that America sells by doubling it is what they sell. \\&quot;Plop, plop, fizz, fizz,\\&quot; we hear of Alka-Seltzer. Even though any country boy can tell you it only takes one to fix an upset stomach, Americans are now gulping down two at a time. Then men and women began using two razors, then three, then four, now five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surround Sound speakers have been undoubtedly a great improvement, but trying to place them is a pain. The point is, people will buy whatever people will sell them. Practical folks use and reuse what they can -- at least their fathers did. Even tunes, hymns and drinking songs. \\&quot;A, B, C, D, EFGs....\\&quot; Same tune as \\&quot;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\\&quot; Now we have two of at least everything, even cars, homes, computers and cell phones. So I draw the line of razors at two blades, tops. I can&#x27;t get five-blade razors under my nose. One day, unless I stop this madness, they&#x27;re going to blunt, then they&#x27;ll find me in my bathroom, the victim of an apparent suicide, my throat gaping open and that damn razor \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; lying by my side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stay with my Bic, thank you. Not 35 blades in one week, but merely seven.</li>
    <li> Great blade. Smooth shaving great price. I did not nick myself once with this. Fits nice in your hand too.</li>
    <li> I expect a lot of reviews here to be perplexed, even negative (since most people have no idea how to use it), but I bought the Azor 5 as a longtime fan and user of the 4-blade Azor system.  It was a profoundly disappointed. The fifth blade seems to have been added just to conform to a U.S. market devoted to excessive blades. It added nothing to the normal 4-blade experience of my old Azor. But what really makes it a horrible product is the cheapness and thoughtlessness of the design changes from the old one.   The first shave was good, but the second shave ended abruptly after the plastic clips on the handle broke and made the cartridge go wobbly, which resulted in a bloody gash on my neck.   If you&#x27;re a satisfied user of previous Azor models, I recommend seeking them out instead of risking your neck (literally) on this razor. The King of Shaves/Remington marriage seems to have resulted in a more cheaply made product. If you&#x27;ve never used a real King of Shaves razor, please don&#x27;t let this poor impersonator fool you into thinking it is one. I&#x27;m going to stick with the old Azor handles and cartridges. If they ever go off the market, I&#x27;ll probably slum it (and waste more money) with something from Gillette.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this razor, but after using it for two weeks, I&#x27;m pretty certain I won&#x27;t be ordering any more blades for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;This is the most comfortable razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  The first time I used it, I checked twice to make sure there wasn&#x27;t plastic still covering the blades.  The handle design makes it easy to keep the five bladed head flat against the skin, and the shaving surface is wide and flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;As good as this is at shaving most of my face, it fails at the detail work.  I can&#x27;t judge where the first blade starts, so trimming my sideburns is an adventure.  Getting close under my nose is also pretty tricky.  I hate shaving, and anything that makes it take longer than it has to just won&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The Remington Azor (that&#x27;s \\&quot;razor\\&quot; without the \\&quot;r\\&quot;) is an interesting design experiment that, at least for me, doesn&#x27;t quite work. The shaving angle of the Azor is completely different from any other blade shaver, and takes a great deal of getting used to. If you shave every day for about forty years, there&#x27;s a lot of ingrained muscle memory that has to be re-learned to use the Azor comfortably. The five blade cartridge seems nice, but, probably because of the handle and the shaving angle, I don&#x27;t get as close a shave as I would like. I&#x27;ve used it a good while now, and I am on the last supplied cartridge. I don&#x27;t think I will be using it after that. I&#x27;m going to go back to good ol&#x27; Gillette.</li>
    <li> I got this razor for my boyfriend since he really likes a smooth shave and the reviews were good.  But no bueno! He HATED this razor!  His mustache would get stuck in between the blades and he would have to rinse the razor after each stroke. It took forever since the blades are so close together and he had to work really hard to get them out!  It does come with 3 blades, which normally would be a good steal...but he used 2 of those on his first shave. Turns out it was not a good deal AT ALL :(</li>
    <li> This is a great razor! Nice, Clean, Smooth shave! Feels good in the hand and doesn&#x27;t nick or cut unless you are too rough with it which is always a plus! Refills can be expensive but I get a better and more pleasing shave out of this than those expensive electric ones!</li>
    <li> I want to start by clearly saying that I&#x27;m reviewing this product as a woman. I haven&#x27;t shaved my face with this razor (I hope I don&#x27;t ever need to...!) I have used this razor to clear-cut the jungle on my legs and underarms. I don&#x27;t like women&#x27;s razors. They are froo-froo, ugly baby pastel colored, and usually have some ridiculous guard system built in so that you don&#x27;t cut yourself while shaving. Ridiculous! So I buy men&#x27;s razors, which are usually all-business and no froo-froo. This razor did stand up to the test, but it hasn&#x27;t become my ultimate go-to yet. I feel that even with a new cartridge I still need to go back over several spots to attain ultimate smoothness. I don&#x27;t like doing multiple passes over the same spot. I don&#x27;t have time for that! I like to shave once and be done. So one star off for that. The razor is comfortable to hold, but I had to get used to placing my fingers in the \\&quot;U\\&quot; shaped portion for control instead of just using the lower handle. The lower handle is a bit skinny, but does have a nice rubberized grip. The blades seem to last an average amount of time, about the same as other brands I&#x27;ve tried. As a woman, I would give this razor a shot, but only as a comparison piece to a couple of others to see what you personally like best.</li>
    <li> I liked the sleek design of this razor. The parallel grip really made for a smooth glide.  It was a lot different than the normal razors I&#x27;ve used, but I found it to be much more comfortable once I did get the hang of it.  I liked the sink top display and holder that houses the razor and refill blades.  I like the 5 blade smooth glide system and the resulting close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with was the resulting razor bumps that I did not get from other 5 blade shavers.  Not sure why this happened and I did switch blades to ensure it wasn&#x27;t that specific blade.  Still received the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, no real complaint.  I will say that I didn&#x27;t see a big difference in the use of this razor compared to the cheaper disposable 5 blade systems.  But if you are looking for a nice fit to a modern bathroom decorating design, this razor will work well.</li>
    <li> My husband will use nothing else. Loves these!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty razor.  But, to paraphrase Forrest Gump:  Pretty is as pretty does.  It gives a nice shave, but you expect that a modern razor will be sharp and give a good shave.  The head of this razor is set very flat rather than at an angle.  For me, this was a drawback.  Once the handle of the razor became wet, the entire razor was hard to control.  I found that the design of the razor lent itself to being tricky when my hand became wet.  The razor became very slippery and I nicked myself.  I tried to get the hang of it, but could not.  After the second nick, I pitched it.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend, who regularly grows a goatee, has been using this shaver since it arrived. He like how it provides a smooth shave and glides over his skin, however, changing the blades is not as quick and easy as other shavers. It&#x27;s grip is comfortable and is aesthetically pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of its bulky design it&#x27;s not very good with detail shaving under the beard. There really are too many blades on this shaver, far more than are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s since gone back to using his old shavers, even if the price for replacements is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I got several sets of these on a deal of the day type place and now I know why I got so much for such a reasonable price. The first shave with this razor the handle broke and the blades will not stay clipped on so it went in the trash. The blades clog every single time I shave so I usually end up using 2 blades per shave good thing I have so many blades to throw out... The 2nd handle the metal part of the handle keeps coming off but its still usable. I rated it a 2 simply because I got so many blades for so cheap and if I suffer through using it I can eventually get a nice shave with it.</li>
    <li> It was a close cut but the blade wore out /dulled with one shave- 5 blades is great. Let me state the person did shave a full beard off though and has thick hair. He founf  the 5 blades nice but not secure and said the clips need to be stronger. Overall good, takes getting used to but it was goo, not excellent but  did a fine job.</li>
    <li> This razor broke before I was even able to finish the first purchased set of blades. The blades were on sale, so I assumed it was decent quality and bought 2 packages of blades. Now I have a couple of new blades left over and an unused packages of blades with broken razor. I will not be buying another razor. It has these cheap plastic tabs that broke off and won&#x27;t hold the blade in place. Shame on Remington for putting out such a poor quality product and charging so much.</li>
    <li> I tried this after my electric ran out of battery one day, since I had it around.  It&#x27;s stiff and unwieldy and the shave didn&#x27;t seem superior in any way to the electric that I have.</li>
    <li> I bought this during one of amazon&#x27;s lightning deals, for the price I thought \\&quot;how bad can it be\\&quot;.  I got my answer.  After using this razor for two weeks I have the following issues.  Not a close shave, I have to do more than twice the number of passes that my generic store brand razor I was using previously did.  The blades also &#x27;fill up&#x27; rather fast, and when you try to clean it out by tapping it on the sink one of two things will happen.  The blade will either fly off, or the handle will fall apart.  I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t buy any additional cartridges when I got it.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how well this razor (and blades) shaved.  It is a bit strange, as the razor handle is at a strange (backwards) angle, but you get used to that quickly.  I was very surprised at how close it shaved with very little pressure.  I am switching from the power version of the most popular brand of razors.  Mainly because it shaves just as well and the blades are way, way cheaper.  And, this is very important, the blades last much longer than the main razor company brand.  Well done.  Good razor.  Worth trying it out if you haven&#x27;t.  For the cost of two replacement blades of the main selling brand you can check this one out.</li>
    <li> So we have gone from a single blade, to a double and on up to what is now a 5-blade razor. But that is not the most unique feature of this item. The handle and lack of tilt usually seen in razors is really the big feature change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5-blade system is excellent. It provides a really close, smooth shave without nicks or cuts. However, my husband hated the flat, no-tilt handle. He said the lack of tilt made shaving more difficiult for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it makes shaving my legs easier for me. I loved the no tilt handle - perfect in the shower. So maybe Remington should start promoting this item for women?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are similar to others on the market - but 5 instead of 3 like most new razors. They cartridge is easy to change and seems to last as long as any other shaver of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for women, but not so much for men.</li>
    <li> To start with, I&#x27;ve been using Gillette 5 blades for awhile, and they tend to give me lots of microcuts/zits AND they are pricey.   I caught this blade on a Amazon deal and decided I have nothing to lose. Its kinda funky, but you get used to it pretty quick.   Pros: Smoother shaves, fewer zits, longer lasting than Gillette, cheaper replacement blades  Cons: Can&#x27;t find them in my local stores.</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; razor seems more gimmicky than anything else. My husband doesn&#x27;t like that it lays flat -- it&#x27;s hard to get it to round the edges of the face easily, or it takes more effort to learn than he wants to expend. The shave is close, but no closer than any other modern razor. He has abandoned the razor so I use it to shave my legs. It works well except around the knees.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, who shaves his head bald and he did not like it. He said it wasn&#x27;t very sharp. It pulled and tugged on his hairs and nicked him.  I was surprised that he disliked it so much so I tried it out on my legs. I believe there is a learning curve to using it due to its blade position.  However, I am not able to say that I liked this razor, either.</li>
    <li> I believe I bought this with a promo cash back upon purchase at a drugstore, though I had many Schick Quatro and Extreme3 blades stocked up.  Big mistake.  Using up my small qty blades in my cabinet, I tried this and had to sweep 5-10 times to get most spots, even afterwards having to use my Schick to get missed spots.  Stubble left on the head, little spots missed on the face,  didn&#x27;t get the top of the ears.  Believe this has been discontinued and rightfully so.  I know better than to try Remington again.</li>
    <li> I tried it, I really did, but I could not get the baby butt smooth shave that I love, it also rusted in the shower in less then a week... Remington should get their name disassociated with this product ASAP!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it, but the issues other people have reported are kind of wearing on me. The blades clog too fast, the blade-head likes to pop out too easily, and the &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34; is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I have a Van Dyke beard so I need a razor for my cheek and neck, nothing particularly tricky involved.  This razor just felt awkward to use to me.  Trying to get a close shave seemed difficult to me because I found the razor difficult to hold the right way.  I also found it difficult to replace the blades.  I even had a problem with a blade popping loose and then spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to get it back in.  I admit that I eventually gave up on the razor and didn&#x27;t even finish using all the blades that came with it.  This razor just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
    <li> Works great,  this shaver is much better then any others I have used before and way cheaper.  No cuts, no irritation, very close shave, easy !  Gillette - bye, bye, never again.</li>
    <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;e signed me up as part of a product test and I agreed to try it out.  It was time to shave the four day stubble, anyway.  I really wanted to like the Remington Azor 5 Blade. Really did.  And I appreciated the opportunity to test the new Remington Azor 5 Blade.  But after the product test I can&#x27;t honestly say that I would give up my Gillette razor.  Even with a three month old blade in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor had a nice feel to it, I especially liked the grip, but that is as far as it goes.  While the Azor 5 Blade sounds like a close shave, it was everything but.  With the first swipe I could already tell this razor was not for me.  The razor does not have the cutting power that my regular razor does.  It took at least three to four more swipes with the Azor 5 than with my regular brand. And when I tried to rinse the hairs off the razor they wouldn&#x27;t wash off.  The hairs stuck to this razor like a thick layer crust. As I tapped the razor to help remove the hairs, the cartridge came flying off.  This happened, without lying, about four times.  And to be totally honest the cartridge is not that easy to click back into place.  By that time, I was so frustrated that I reached for the medicine cabinet and grabbed my Gillette razor.</li>
    <li> Dear husband and I were skeptical at first, as this razor has a very unique design to it. Add to that the fact that neither of us had ever used a 5-bladed razor before. However, our doubts were quickly dismissed by the fact that, after shaving his face, Hubby&#x27;s chin was the smoothest I&#x27;d ever felt it! The design takes a little getting-used-to, but only because it makes shaving much easier by following the contours of your face. He loved the look and feel of this close shave so much that it got him shaving every day(compared to maybe once a week before!) We&#x27;ll never go back to disposables...  :D</li>
    <li> This is my first and quite possibly my last review (mostly because I&#x27;m too lazy to write reviews).  But this razor got me motivated to write a review.  I got this razor because it was in one of those lightning deals and I am floored at how good this razor is!  The bendable head and the shape of the razor is what makes this razor stand out amongst all other razors.  It applies the right amount of pressure to your face and at first i wasn&#x27;t even sure that it was shaving anything because it was so smooth.  I was thinking of going electric but this razor will keep me from going that route for years to come.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this razor because I was hoping to find a cheaper alternative to the Gillette Mach 3 that I&#x27;m using now.  I love everything about the Mach 3 except the price).  When this razor arrived I put it to work the next morning and I was immediately disappointed.  The handle is poorly designed, making the razor akward to use for shaving my face.  I really gave it a chance, using it for 5 days in a row, but at this point, I&#x27;m trashing it, as I pretty much hate it.  I&#x27;m going back to the Mach 3 which I consider the best razor ever made. Even though the Gillette is pricey, it&#x27;s very much worth it.</li>
    <li> Generally I use a Gillette Fusion, but I decided to give the King of Shaves a try as it was a new design and being the novelty seeking individual I am, I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a few things I really do like about the razor, the grip angle is more comfortable for me than the typical shape, the cartridge refills are cheaper, and the flexibility of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as what I do with the Gillette Fusion, not sure what it is, but I still felt very stubbly right after I shaved, as stubbly as I feel after 5-6 hours after shaving with the Fusion. I would really like this razor to be great, but I will go back to using the Gillette.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this shaver. I love the King of Shaves shave gel, and wanted to try this shaver. It&#x27;s a novel design that takes a minute to get used to, but once you&#x27;ve got the technique down, it&#x27;s a nice shave.  However, I guess I don&#x27;t shave as often as I need to, and the blades on this clog easily.  And they&#x27;re not easy to un-clog.  Running water through the blades didn&#x27;t help, and you can&#x27;t knock/tap it against the sink/shower, because the blade just falls off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I say, I wanted to like this shaver, and I sort of did. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  If you shave every day, then you&#x27;re probably OK.</li>
    <li> Like many people, I thought I would try these as a replacement for my Gillette razor. BAD IDEA. These are not as sharp, they clog more quickly, and the shape is awkward. Just stick with what you know works. Avoid these.</li>
    <li> Blades do not last as long as others I have used.</li>
    <li> The Azor was a decent shave. However I had some major issue trying wash the hair off the carthridge after a relatively normal shave. Furthermore attaching the bulky razor was somewhat tricky.  Handling was not bad but it was a bit too bulky and nothing great. If I was not so happy with some of its competitors I would probably be much more satisfied and provide a better review.  I have tried several of Azor&#x27;s competitors and I think this is not as good.  I haven&#x27;t paid attention to pricing, so it may be a good value from that perspective.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my legs.  It does the job very well and it is easy to hold.  The cartridge falls off it once in a while, so you need to be gentle with it, but it&#x27;s well worth for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> The design of this hand razor is quite different from standard razors, so it takes a few days to get used to the grip and feel. Nevertheless, once that&#x27;s accomplished, this is a perfectly comfortable razor. Do we really need 5 blades instead of one? Will 6-blade razors come next? In any case, the five blades work, and I&#x27;ve had no nicks or cuts in a month of use. If you&#x27;re unhappy with the more traditional razor shapes, give this a try.</li>
    <li> Given all its blades and apparent features, my expectations were high. Not such thing. You will hardly get a cut though!&lt;br /&gt;The shave seems very protected then, but is goes at the expense of getting a very close one with true baby-butt feeling by the end.</li>
    <li> I like Fusions but this razor provides the closest, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I see all the awful reviews here and wonder what&#x27;s going on.</li>
    <li> Bought this the other day in Tesco. Love their gels and oils but the razor is really bad compared to the gillete razor with 5 blades (forget name)&lt;br /&gt;The rubber near the razor head is too stiff so the razor doesn&#x27;t follow the more awkward face contours like chin.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend  AT ALL!</li>
    <li> As a long time Gilette Mach 3 user I don&#x27;t believe that this is the absolute best razor out there, but the Remington King of Shaves provides a good shave at a much better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design feels a little awkward at first, but I got used to it fairly quickly.  After using it for awhile it seems that the blades aren&#x27;t dulling as quickly as with a Mach 3 or Schick Hydro 5.  I haven&#x27;t experienced a problem with nicks yet, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have started to doing is to dry my razors off after use to prevent rust from forming on the blades.  Works well for me on all razors.</li>
    <li> After I&#x27;m done shaving with this product I grab the razor I used previously to finish the job.  I had no problem switching out the blades as other suggested.  I went through all 3 the first week thinking that maybe I just got a dud.  The blades are too close together and are constantly getting clogged.  Also the angle of the blades makes tapping it clean difficult.</li>
    <li> Shave takes twice as long over using a Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;Even so - it&#x27;s not as close of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;The hair gets stuck in blade and does not wash out.&lt;br /&gt;Did they even test ? It&#x27;s full of hair right away and does not wash out!&lt;br /&gt;I had to use a q tip to get hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went back to Gillette after 4 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted these to work well but they didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion five blade, the Gillette Mach 3 and the Schick Mach 3.  I&#x27;m staying with the Azor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main reason is the shave is close and comfortable.  The price happens to be better than the Mach 3 and way better than the Fusion, but I actually prefer this shave to the Gillette products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to some of the reviews on this site, I don&#x27;t feel the handle on the Azor is slick; it actually has a rubber insert to reduce slipping.  Nor did it take me any length of time to get used to the Azor.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe a product can be this bad. I wonder what the designer was thinking.&lt;br /&gt;The only way to clean it is using a Waterpik.</li>
    <li> I love the shape of this razor although some may not.  Personal preference. The blades are great and cost less than Schick or Gillette. I have made the switch to Remington to save money. Great razor, great price.</li>
    <li> it was not a good razor blades dual never will i buy it  ever again it was the worst ever</li>
    <li> This is the worst thing I ever purchased.  It&#x27;s pure garbage.  You are better off taking a knife from your kitchen drawer and shaving with it.  I felt I owed it to whoever is thinking of buying this to let them know not to.</li>
    <li> I shave once a week with a Gillette razor. Takes me 20-25 minutes absolute max. Saw a groupon for this, and figured groupons been okay for me thus far and its time to get some new blades anyway. Today I tried this product for the first time. It took me over an hour of struggling with an uneven patchy shave before I finished. And what&#x27;s that? Yep I can now feel some neck hair that was not properly shaved because of this piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the people that actually rated this 5 stars, I&#x27;m just going to assume you all work for Remington...and have terrible facial hair.</li>
    <li> I must say, this is the worst razor I ever tried including the cheap disposables they give out at hotels when you forget your own. What the problem with it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades clogs easily and won&#x27;t clean.&lt;br /&gt;Blades are dull.&lt;br /&gt;Does not provide a close shave at all&lt;br /&gt;The handle has too much flex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from an Amazon affiliate Woot thinking it was a value purchase. I&#x27;m throwing away the razor and all the extra blades in the trash. I wouldn&#x27;t give this razor to a homeless person. Stay far away! In this case I wanted cheap and got it!</li>
    <li> I recently grew tired with my Schick Quattro razor, and decided to try something new. For the same price, I came across this product. When I first opened the box, I thought to myself, \\&quot;Do I honestly need five blades?\\&quot;    The short answer: Yes.    The main reason as to why my other razors had to be replaced is because of the nicks and cuts. The blades are quite sharp, yet they remarkably find a way to not pull on my bristles and have caused me to have an overall better shaving experience in the morning. If you are in the market for a non-electric razor, try this out.</li>
    <li> Worst razors I have ever used and I do not have a ton of facial hair. Clog easily and go dull fast. Guess it&#x27;s a blessing since I bought 3 sets and usually toss a blade after 2 uses. Save your money and stick with disposable or a quality electric</li>
    <li> Actually purchased this razor from Woot. Gave it several attempts over a month. This has got to be the absolute WORST shave ever. I needed to actually use my finger to apply pressure (ALOT) to even get it to cut any facial hair. I now have about 30 more that I will not use unless absolutely, absoultely nessecary. When shaving, I must literally go over the same spots 3/4 times with a brand new blade. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews...but do NOT waste your money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a super think beard, and while I don&#x27;t shave often, and try to trim only when I can, I have never really crossed a razor I didn&#x27;t like. I just tended to buy what was seemingly decent but also cheap. Didn&#x27;t want to shred my face to waste money, so I purchased this razor on lightning deal with plenty of blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, there is a reason I hadn&#x27;t heard about this \\&quot;king of shaves\\&quot; before. It sucks. The pressure you need to get a clean, accurate shave is lost in the give built into the razor to aide in giving you a close shave. Instead it does a sloppy job, causing you to spend more time shaving. It gets two stars because the blades are sharp and it will get the job done. Apparently part of sucking it up and being a man is paying out the nose for blades if you want em. Such is.</li>
    <li> I compare this product to the very best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from one of those fancy powered Fusion shavers, and this is every bit as good for a fraction of the price. I shave every day, and with my tough hair and sensitive skin I can barely go a week with a Fusion blade head before tossing it. With the Azor-5, I can go 2 weeks with a shave head, and then I only toss it because it seems like maybe it isn&#x27;t quite as sharp but my face doesn&#x27;t get sensitive. So maybe I can go longer. The real deal is in the refill blades, where I get 6 refills for the Azor-5 for about 2/3 the price of a 4-pack of the Fusion refills making each blade head 1/2 the price of the Fusion heads. Half the price, twice the life, four times the bargain, and my face loves me. Pair this with their King of Shaves gel and you won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: I know how to stretch and twist my face so that I can shave under my nose, but if I had Karl Malden&#x27;s nose then I might have trouble with this under my nose. I&#x27;m fortunate to not be cursed with a grotesque bulbous probiscous.</li>
    <li> The shape and angle of this shaver/razor is great for women, not so much for men.  The handle of this razor is very very fragile and will break if you drop it.  Overall, the shave is close and the razor works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the worst product ever created, but it is the worst 5 blade razor ever created.  If a disposable one-blade razor is a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; and the Fusion ProGlide Power razor with New FlexBall Technology is a 5 (which it is), then this is a two.  The razor is designed to flex with the contours of your face but the blade moves to the wrong angle.  You end up with poorly shaven sections.  I bought this on a Woot with refill blades, so I&#x27;ve put up with it and gotten my money&#x27;s worth, but I cannot recommend it.  The Fusion ProGlide blades cost so much more, but the razor is the best.  I used to use the Shick Quattro, which is a very close second with much cheaper blades.  As soon as my blade stock is out, I will use the ProGlide exclusively and pay the extra $1 a month for blades, which you can buy for less in big packs at Costco.</li>
    <li> When I first took this out of the package it looked and felt different, very flexible and bendy. I had to press really hard to get it to actually shave my face, it would just take off the shaving creme. After a FEW days of using it I am getting used to it and it does give a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> the neck is very flexible rubber so when you try to shave there is no pressure and does not shave just scratches your skin would not recommend to anyone. I would not use this if it was free.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes after reading some positive reviews, BUT after shaving with this razor my report is that it simply does not shave as close as my now once again to be everyday gillette fusion razor.</li>
    <li> I waited for a while before submitting my review because I normally use a Braun 7-790CC Series 7 electric shaver most of the time on my sensitive skin and need to shave close without nicks and razor burns. But its a slow way to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at times I do want a close, and fast shave so I have been using a Gillette Sensor3 razor about twice to three times a week. I saw the Remington King of Shaves Azor 5 Blade Manual Men&#x27;s Razor here on Amazon and was intrigued by the marketing spiel, so I bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claim was that the Endurium 5 thin coated blades last longer, but so far, I&#x27;m getting the about same amount of shaves from that type of blade as I did with the Gillette Sensor3 razor blades, and I am having to grab my Gillette Sensor razor to finish all of the areas that the Azor razor missed or couldn&#x27;t reach, like under the nose, chin and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington Azor 5 Replacement Men&#x27;s Shaver Cartridges - $2.37/ cartridge on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Sensor3 Cartridges - $2.25 / cartridge on Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good part is that I don&#x27;t get as many cuts and scrapes with the Remington cartridges as I did with the Gillette Sensor3 cartridges, but the bad is that I don&#x27;t get as close and quick a shave either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main fault in the Remington Azor razor design is the handle. It is awkward to hold and use and pull across your face, and the blades do not tilt and follow the contours of my face the way the Gillette Sensor3 razor does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition the design of the cartridge holder is poor. Not only do you spend a lot of time pulling the razor across your skin only to find that the cartridge holder was sliding across your skin instead of the blades, but the cartridges pop off the razor from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white rubber cartridge holder \\&quot;bumper\\&quot; that you press in to release the razor cartridge, sits a bit higher than the blades and so if you put any pressure on the razor against your skin, the white rubber cartridge release, releases the shaving cartridge. If you try to rinse the blades after use, hot water causes the white rubber holder to relax, shooting the cartridge into the sink or to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes twice to three times longer, and twice the shaving creme, to finally get a clean shave with the Remington Azor razor as it does with the Gillette Sensor3 razor. Because of the handle, cartridge holder, and the cost of replacement cartridges, I can&#x27;t recommend this razor.ite rubber cartridge release, releases the shaving cartridge. If you try to rinse the blades after use, hot water causes the white rubber holder to relax, shooting the cartridge into the sink or to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes twice to three times longer, and twice the shaving creme, to finally get a clean shave with the Remington Azor razor as it does with the Gillette Sensor3 razor. Because of the handle, cartridge holder, and the cost of replacement cartridges, I can&#x27;t recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Overall, this razor works well and is a good value. The head pivots greatly and with out much tension, which seems a bit excessive  really. Shave comparisons between this and my Gillette Fusion power 5 blade shows that it isn&#x27;t quite as close. I use either Proraso shave soap or  Proraso cream and shave my entire head. I love the guys that say use a safety razor and it only takes them an extra 5 minutes. I&#x27;m a guy that doesn&#x27;t especially like to shave, has a medium course beard that shaves every other day.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor but there are a number of them, on the market , that are just as good and less expensive.</li>
    <li> Overall this razor is the worst I have used, and I got it for FREE. (Got 5 on Black Friday @ Walgreens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razor is a nice concept with poor execution. I have tried shaving with varying length of facial hair, different shaving creams and changing the blade 4 to 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these give me a full shave, I am a 22 yr old male with not very coarse or thick facial hair. The razor continually clogged and was tough to clean/knock hair out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;None, less expensive blades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Everything else about the use, cleaning, storage, build quality and effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this review is more relevant, I gave one to my father to see if he liked it, he came up from trying it one Sunday and had more then 5 nicks on his face (which he has never had a problem with. He is 55 with slightly more coarse hair, non-beard. Hated it even more then I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then finally I gave a couple to some buddies staying the weekend and they despised them additionally. To conclude I have never rated a product this badly Nor do I often go to this extent to do so, I just had to share with Amazon, potential customers and Remington that this product is less then ideal for it&#x27;s customers.</li>
    <li> Okay. I know its a mens shaver and I did get it for my husband or son (whichever wanted to use it first).  My son used it but he really doesn&#x27;t give me much feedback on it so I took it and shaved my legs....WOW!  I think they just lost their shaver because this thing shaves so close and smooth it&#x27;s unbelievable.  It has a lot of blades but the head pivots so well (even with all those blades) that it shaved my leg with no problem whatsoever.  I like the fact that even though one side apppears to be metal the other is rubberized to it is easy to hold even while wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m off to go shave my other leg.</li>
    <li> Worst razor ever. Glad to see that so many others here share my opinion! I bought this on Woot a while ago, loved the price, especially for the replacement blades. But it&#x27;s horribly un-ergonomic, the handle is slippery, and the big &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34; in the y-shaped handle leaves no place for your finger to guide or add pressure. The blades are packed so tightly that it clogs up and just glides over your skin without cutting anything, and it&#x27;s very hard to clean out. I&#x27;ve also tried using it to shave my head, and it does an even worse job there. I just threw the razor and a couple boxes of extra blades in the trash. I&#x27;ll stick with my Mach 3, or some cheap disposable over this.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. You have to shave over the same area three times for a clean shave. spend more and get a mach 3</li>
    <li> Not worth it.  This started out great, but quickly clogs.  Water through the back, tapping on the sink, running a thumb backwards over the blades, nothing seems to get the scruff out of the blades.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I was mixed when I read the reviews but getting tired of spending a ton of money on Gillette Pro Glides I decided I had to at the least give this Remington a try. For sure it&#x27;s different unlike any other razor handle and it will take you a few shaves to figure out the angle that works best for you but once you do you will find that it&#x27;s superior. They put some rubber grips on the handle but if your hands are soapy you do have to make sure you are gripping from the rubber part and not the shiny chrome. I don&#x27;t have any trouble cleaning the razor as others have said. Also the Remington does not cause any irritation on my face where other razors do (every other razor I have used does including the Gillette Pro Glide). If you buy this and give it a chance your will not be disappointed but if you expect it to be like every other razor you have used in the past you will not like it. You have to have an open mind and be willing to try something different only then can you experience the superior design. The only thing I miss is the Gillette has the single trimmer blade and this is a nice touch. However I have found that it&#x27;s possible to change the Remington&#x27;s angle and get almost at close. For less than half the price of the Gillette&#x27;s seriously buy this and give it an honest chance.</li>
    <li> The King of Shaves razor looks amazingly sleek against its competition, handles nicely after a short learning curve, but its blades are the worst. The multi-blade configuration clogs with beard shavings all too easily -- takes a toothbrush to clean. And, the blades are of terrible quality metal that dull after only a few uses. Replacing them is tricky and far from intuitive. Major disappointment.</li>
    <li> I got this razor along with 15 blades from Woot for what I thought was a steal.($7 or so plus shipping) Never before have I been disappointed with an item from woot because they have such great deals.  However, after using this razor for 2 weeks, I begrudgingly continue to use it just to try to get my money out of it.  The head is EXTREMELY flexible, so much so that I have to hold the back of the blades to push it to my skin.  If I don&#x27;t push the blades against my skin, it takes a good 5-10 strokes before I&#x27;m left with stubble. No matter how many strokes, it never shaves the hair as low as a cheap-o bic razor does with just 1 pass. As for the sheer quantity of blades, I have since found out why you need so many with this razor.  Since there are so many blades packed in very tightly on this razor, the space between the blades gets clogged with hair after just 2-3 complete shaves.  After that, it is so backed up with hair, it will not shave no matter what.  Shaving usually takes me 2-6 minutes depending on how long it&#x27;s been since I last shaved; with this razor, it takes me over 10 minutes every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AWFUL product that I would not use if it were free.</li>
    <li> terrible blades.  A new blade will get clogged up with hair immediately.  I&#x27;m a daily shaver, average thickness for beard but cant get through half my face with out having to stop and really scrub the blade to clean it out.  Bought 30 blades on wot for a deal but after using 5 blades gave up.  Gave to Girlfriend to see if she liked it but she hates them to.  Will throw away before using again.</li>
    <li> I am a soldier and have to shave 5 days a week, i also have very sensitive skin and for years ive searched for a roazor that didnt cut up my face and give me soars, Then i found this, i only purchased it because it was the last they had in Tesco but WOW! ive had it for 3 months and still no soars!&lt;br /&gt;Very Very impressed!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor as a skeptic.  I am a longtime Mach 3 user as none of the expensive razors that have come out did a better job than my Mach 3.  After trying out the Remington King of Shaves all I can say is \\&quot;Long live the King\\&quot;.  I got a tremendously close shave and it was extremely comfortable.  The fact that the blades are not crazy expensive and will (hopefully) last longer makes this razor a slam dunk.  My face is extremely difficult for razors since I have a tough and thick beard combined with sensitive skin.  If this razor can do a great job on my face it can do a great job on any face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used my new Remington KOS Azor 5 for a week now and I must admit it&#x27;s unlike any other razor I have used.  It actually \\&quot;sweeps\\&quot; over your face and you don&#x27;t feel the blades at all.  I use a pre-shave oil and shave cream so I&#x27;m not sure if that makes any difference, but I was also very suprised how closer this razor got compared to my Mach 5.  I am going to be getting at least two more.</li>
    <li> I continue to be unimpressed with 5 blade razors. I tried this one because it was cheap. My BIC 3 blade disposable which I have been using usually last around 5-6 weeks before it starts pulling and being uncomfortable usually around my chin. This one began pulling the second week and frankly I don&#x27;t feel any difference between it and my BIC as far as closeness goes. Just my own experience but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a longtime Gillette Fusion user, but I thought I would check out the competition and see if I might find something decent and a bit less expensive.  To follow up on this I bought both this Remington and one of the Schick Hydro 5 razors. I first tried the Remington, but it gave me an awful shave.  While it was comfortable, it left a lot of beard.  My take on it is that it was no more effective than a cheap single blade disposable. The shave was so inadequate that I had to go over it again with the Schick, which was quite satisfactory (but lacking the the battery-powered vibration I like so much with the Gillette).  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  It is junk.  I&#x27;m giving it to my neighbor to use when she shaves her legs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Fusion for years, but recently decided to give the \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; a try. The shaver is really nice, and comfortable to hold. It also produces a close shave, about as good as a Fusion if not better. I also felt like my shaves were taking less time with the Remington, or at least that was my perception. On major CON for me was the lack of a straight-edge on top. It was a good thing I still had my old Fusion with a blade remaining to take care of any straight-edge work. Also, the removing the blades and putting on replacement blades is not as easy as it should be.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor having previously used standard azor&#x27;s and found them to be very good. I can honestly say this was the worst shave I ever had. The blades, although good quality, are far too close together, and as a result become clogged with hair that is very difficult to remove, and stop cutting. Steer clear unless you don&#x27;t have any hair on your face and just want to stroke your skin with a sharp blade or five.</li>
    <li> Okay so first off these blades are not all that much cheaper than any other razor out there. Like other similar models I had issues with the blades getting clogged and were very difficult to rinse. Now this may be just be me but like the other similar razor I tried with 4 blades this one kept nicking the edge of my jaw (guess my face is a little to angular or these wide cartridges). Also the design is a bit odd and not to easy to get used to. Honestly if your looking to save some money and get a decent shave do what I have done, switch back to a DE razor and learn to shave with it .10 a blade and rarely get a nick once you are used to them (with good blades).</li>
    <li> First of all, this razor comes at a great price, especially for having 3 extra blades in the package. It is definitely cheaper than other brands, but is also great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself looks so sleek and rich. It has a nice weight to it and is very well made. It is a different design/angle than most other razors and that can take a shave or two to get used to, but overall it offers a great shave and I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When paired up with the Remington King Of Shaves shave gel, it makes for a great shave. No irritation and soothed, smooth, soft skin.</li>
    <li> Like I am assuming alot of others who have tried this razor I was hoping to find an alternative to the outrageously expensive Gillette blades. I read the reviews of this razor being awkward to use at 1st but figured it certainly is worth getting used to if it means not paying the exhorbitant prices Gillete gets. Unfortunately I only gave this 3 tries. Aside from the very awkward angle for shaving which WAS annoying, the 2 most critical reasons I ended up throwing it away was #1) I found that the entire width of the blades were not touching my face. There was a gap somewhere towards the middle as I moved the razor across my skin. #2) It is impossible to be able to get near the part of your upper lip and nose. The Gillette razor has a single blade for that purpose which I don&#x27;t even need to use because I can get there just fine with the 5 blades.</li>
    <li> I thought this sleek razor was going to free me from Gillette&#x27;s hold on me!  Boy, was I wrong!!  This razor has so much motion in its head that it can not make consistent contact with your head/ face/ other.  I resorted to holding the head with my thumb to give it some resistance.  Yea, it worked then but it is way too much effort!  Do not purchase this razor!!</li>
    <li> If I could give this razor less than one star, I would. I purchased this in hopes that it would work well and have a more reasonable replacement blade cost than the Venus line that I have used for years. The reviews all indicated that it works best over flat areas, so I thought that it would be perfect for daily leg-shaving needs. For this purpose, it functioned adequately, though with the angle of the handle, it was often necessary to go over areas more than once. That was for the first 3 weeks, and today the blade kept falling off. Further examination and an attempt to put a replacement blade cartridge on showed that the blades are held in place with very flimsy plastic tabs. They are SO flimsy, in fact, that after less than a month of about every-other-day use, one is broken. This leaves the razor completely unusable, as the blade cartridge will not stay attached. So, after less than a month I have a broken razor handle, and a good supply of replacement cartridges that I can&#x27;t use. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on what seems like a good deal - if it sounds too good to be true, in this case it definitely is!</li>
    <li> This razor is unique but not the best. The tension created when you press the handle against skin is fair but it is so flexible that it bends when it shouldn&#x27;t and doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. The blade wasn&#x27;t the sharpest either. I had to go over my face twice where with the gillette fusion, once is enough. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Tracy&#x27;s husband here. Very disappointing daily razor. The value was very good compared to the premium razors so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Unfortunately the King of Shaves 5 more closely resembles a standard disposable razor as opposed to a higher end Schick or Gillette straight blade. I have a thicker beard and this razor provides a clean shave maybe once or twice before the quality degrades. It&#x27;s very difficult to get under the nose and the corners of the mouth. The blades also clog with hairs easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not a quality daily shave. Not worth spending even the few cents more than a standard disposable. I hate to say it but it&#x27;s back to the premium overpriced razors for me. Will no one create an affordable quality razor? It can&#x27;t be this hard...</li>
    <li> It gives a clean close shave. Feels great in your hand. Easy to clean. Blades hold their edge . I recommend this product</li>
    <li> [Good]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works just as well as competing safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Misc]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really see any major differences between this and competing products. Nothing really differentiated it for it except for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review may be biased because I got this as a really good deal on Woot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Verdict]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get a good deal on it, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
    <li> Bunch o&#x27;cry babies on here. The Remington AZOR works well. Very well in fact. Different than others, but a strict practicing regimen lasting, oh maybe 15-seconds, will get you used to it. Blades don&#x27;t clog if you keep another tooth brush handy. Would buy again, but am very old and may well expire before my blades do.</li>
    <li> This razor is horrible and barley removes any hair. I switched from using Gillette Fusion Pro-Glide for over 7 years to the Remington King of Shaves because it was on clearance and now I know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are too close together and clog easily. The first stroke of the razor cuts some of the hair. Then after a rinse and repeat all I feel is tugging on my face. I find myself reapplying shaving cream 2-3 times and re-shaving in order to get all of the hair. Even then there is plenty of stubble left but by then I have given up and need to get on with my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to my Fusion as soon as possible. It is by far a more superior razor and worth the price in my opinion. Especially considering I can go 3-4 weeks on one Fusion cartridge but the Remington last about 2-3 days before they are dull.</li>
    <li> The blades are too close together.  Every swipe against the face results in hairs getting irremovably stuck (unless you want to use a toothbrush constantly).  I have normal facial hair and it takes 2-3 cartridges to get a full shave.  I can get a closer shave with any other razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a reason these are so cheap -- they don&#x27;t work and have been discontinued!</li>
    <li> I picked one of these up along with about 16 blade cartridges for about 8 bucks on a sale a while ago. I should have known it was too good to be true. The cartridges are massive; wider than the space between the nose and upper lip. The flex on the head is too lax preventing it from staying in close contact while going around compound curves such as the back corner of the jaw. The blades also clog easily, so if you go a day or two without shaving be prepared to throw the cartridge away after your next shave. I can&#x27;t tell whether the touted \\&quot;nano coating\\&quot; keeps the blades sharp longer because they&#x27;ve all been too clogged to use after a couple normal shaves.</li>
    <li> I have a really thick beard.  This shaver is different and it does take a little getting use to.  Not that its a bad thing.  The handle has more flex than any razor I have used.  Its a quality handle with good construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate it slightly better than the Gillette Fusion and Mach3 that I have used in the past.  For those that know blades, know what I am talking about.  The blades are angled down for max smoothness and blade sharpness. Its not one of those 45 degree angle blades that cut your skin.  If you have a few days of growth, I use a cheap store blade and get it short then use the King of Shave5.  Flip it over and the stubble washes out with no issue.</li>
    <li> So my husband actually reviewed this. He&#x27;s a man of few words, but the general gist of it is he likes it.  It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;rock his world\\&quot; or anything, but it works well and he likes that the replacement blades are affordable.  I think the way it&#x27;s curved takes a bit of getting used to, but that wasn&#x27;t a big complaint.  Overall, he likes it, just not overwhelmed by it.</li>
    <li> First off, craftsmanship and construction of this razor is of high quality however it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I will go out on a limb and say it&#x27;s just like a right-handed item for a left-handed person, awkward but not totally.  Perhaps patience will allow those who think its use awkward to be more natural as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shaving, it does a good job in that regard.  The weight, heft, balance seems right...it&#x27;s just that angle that gets me.  A good effort though.</li>
    <li> I only bought this because it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I have with this razor is that the design does not allow you to shave your upper lip area effectively.  I constantly have a small bit of stubble left in that area and if you try to use the razor to shave against the grain to shave that stubble, then you risk cutting yourself as the 5 blades make the surface area so big that you cannot maneuver in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why people make razor&#x27;s with 4 and 5 blades when 2 is more than enough.  When you have so many blades, you cannot effectively cut around the contours of your face. This razor also cannot cut the chin area or neck area effectively.  There is always stubble left behind.  If you make 2 and 3 passes, then you again risk cutting or irritating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just waiting for the last two cartridges to run out and then I am going back to the Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since 1999, I haven&#x27;t found anything better than the Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I decided to give this unit 3 stars instead of 1 stars because I think it does give you a close shave on the flatter areas of your face and I am actually getting used to the handle of the razor.  It loses stars because you honestly need this plus a smaller razor to get to the upper lip area; using two razors is just not convenient.  The cartridge is just too big to navigate the upper lip without accidentally cutting yourself.  The ergonomics of the razor are actually pretty good but the five-blade design is just too cumbersome for intricate areas. Mach3 shaves equally as close and it gets the upper lip area so I recommend that more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT #2: The more I use this, the more I am liking it.  But you still need that second safety razor to get the upper lip.  I guess my skin is just getting used to the blade and I like how it shaves the rest of my face.  My rating is more like 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> The 5 blade razor gives a very close shave. However the blades are much closer together and clog-up with standard&lt;br /&gt;US shave cream. Baby Oil works like a charm for shaving !</li>
    <li> In my opinion this shaver SUCKS. I could never get the blades fully rinsed and free of whiskers. As a result it would never get a good close shave anywhere on my face. In addition the blade cartridge kept popping out while attempting to clean it. I took an old toothbrush to it, in a vain attempt to clear the whiskers with little to no success. It might be a good razor if you have NEVER used a BIC disposable razor before.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even make it through a full shave with this piece of junk. I have very coarse facial hair so a blade should not have trouble shaving it off ... Wrong. Had to literally pull a disposable razor out of the trash to finish shaving, very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought the handle and a large number of blades from Amazon subsidiary Woot! for a ridiculously good price.  The handle plus some 15 blades cost the same as three of my regular blades, so why not try it?  Under normal circumstances, this is actually a really good razor; however, I clearly do not qualify as \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I *LOVE* that fact that the blades are supported from behind.  Most 4- or 5-blade razors in the US are stupidly supported by a hinge UNDER the blade. Applying pressure to get into a particular area, like right under the nose or around a more pronounced chin, is useless on those types of razors. Not so for the King of Shaves; however, it seems that no amount of pressure will get such a large blade into areas like the sides of more pronounced chins. I had to find ways to angle the blade in order to get into those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a quality standpoint, the only issue I ran into is that the blade is held in place with a small, rounded clip on either side. Unfortunately, with my first blade I must have hit the side of the sink a bit harder than I should have while cleaning it off, which wore/broke away part of the one clip.  The blade still held in place, but any blade pops off rather easily with vigorous cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of cleaning, this is by far one of the worst blades for people with thick beards and/or those men who like to skip shaving every now and then.  Let&#x27;s face it.  None of us like to shave.  Many like me don&#x27;t mind skipping a day every now and then.  For me, having been working from home for the past three months due to a fractured heel, I skipped every other day quite often.  I also have very coarse facial hair. This razor is horrible for those circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are so close together and they have so many supports underneath that there is nowhere for thicker beard shavings to go.  They get jammed on the supports and get stuck between the blades, so the blade gets loaded with shavings. No amountof vigorous cleaning or water pressure seems to get the hair out of the blades, except maybe a Water Pik on high pressure which might distort the blades. A course beard + skipping a day will almost guarantee that you need to trash the blade afterwards. I&#x27;ve had to toss more than 2/3 of the blades before their time because they got loaded with shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no denying the cost-per-blade savings of this razor, and I will not condemn it as a \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot;. It&#x27;s very clear from my usage that this blade will only be a value to certain kinds of men. If you shave daily, have a lighter beard, and you don&#x27;t have many pronounced features, this will be a good razor for you. If you like skipping shaves now and then, if you have a coarse beard, or if you have pronounced features, stay away -- FAR away.</li>
    <li> The Good --  Price is nice.  Have not EVER cut or nicked myself with it, which is a nice change.  Blades do last well.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad --  The blade is so wide I can&#x27;t get tight spots like under my nose.  Blade clogs easily and often I have to brush it out with an old toothbrush under running water.  Seems to shave unevenly, even on open areas of cheek, so have to go back and forth a lot.</li>
    <li> Do not touch this razor with a barge pole,worst razor I have ever purchased.Cannot believe all the hype,&lt;br /&gt;bristles jam between the blades which are impossible to clear.It does not give you a clean shave.It doesnt get in any of the difficult places.it snags and feels flimsy and cheap.It is one of the worst razors i have ever had in thirty years.&lt;br /&gt;Im heading back to the mach 3 in a hurry!!</li>
    <li> Worst shavers I have ever used.  I never write reviews so you know it sucked.  I got a deal on them when I bought them at woot.com I got like 12 of em..... thinking \\&quot;A razor is a razor\\&quot;  hahaah NOT!!!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> Prior to buying this I was using twin and tri razor. Then I bought this item on DailySteals website as it featured 5 blade razor. The product is worse than twin razor. Very cheap quality, even if you shave over and over the hair still remains. Stay Away from this garbage product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and very good value.  I would recommend this product and feel you get the same shave as gillete for less money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for one week and so far have found it to be very smooth, maybe even smoother than the Mach 3.  It looks and feels very nice and sleek. Overall, it does a good job.  The main drawback is that it is a little too big to be effective in the tight spaces like around the lips.  I find myself going over the same spot numerous times to make sure the stubble in those areas is completely shaved.  I should also add that despite that issue, I haven&#x27;t come close to nicking myself.</li>
    <li> i bought this hoping I can save on money with blades and get a closer shave. it was a let down on both ends. Not only does this not even catch any of my facial hair, but i literally cannot even get it to go flat on my face to cut anything!!!! I&#x27;ve gone over the same area 3 or 4 times and it doesnt shave s***. dont waste your money on this, stick to Gillette.    Gillette has been making shaving products since the early 1900&#x27;s, stick to the companies that know what they&#x27;re doing (even if it cost more for the blades). it&#x27;s well worth it!!</li>
    <li> Was told it gave a great shave, bought it, tried it but found nothing special about it. My previous razor was better at getting under the nose which this one isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This razor is worse than disposable bic razors. It can&#x27;t press against your face very hard and the blades somehow still manage to get worn out quickly.</li>
    <li> The handle for this razor is an abomination.  It must have been designed by someone who has never shaved before.  You end up shaving at a perpendicular angle or worse in an ATTEMPT to get a close shave, and attempt that will always fail.  I got these on the cheap and ended up with 2 handles and 30 cartridges.  I may just use the fresh cartridge once and then throw it away, because that is the only shave that you have a chance of shaving some whiskers.  After that, with the blades so close together it is plugged up, uncleanable, and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, the bass-akwards design and flex in the handle is the true aggravation.  You end up attempting to shave your neck like 10 times, finally giving up and getting out an old, rusty razor to actually get the job done.</li>
    <li> Pulls. Hurts. Cheaply made. Waste of money! Remington needs to just say in the gun market. Razor market not for them!</li>
    <li> Too bad I cannot give negative stars. This is a horrible product. I stupidly bought it through Woot. Which is apparently owned by Amazon now and shills their crap. You might get 1 shave out of a razor. Not even a good one. Then the razor is done. The hair sticks in between the blades and do not come out.Stay away from them!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for a year or so now, and I love it.  I don&#x27;t nick my kneecaps or ankles anymore (I&#x27;m a woman), and the blades hold their edge relatively well.  It&#x27;s heavier than any other razor I&#x27;ve used, and it doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand like a cheap plastic disposable.  Edited to add: My razor one broke not long after I wrote this review, right where the blade snaps in. So I bought a replacement - and it did the exact same thing. The handle is nice and heavy, but the top is thin and cheap. I&#x27;ll be replacing my razor again, but not with a Remington. I&#x27;ll find something else to hold their blades.</li>
    <li> Well I ordered two sets of these with 24 replacement cartridges for $24 shipped from Amazon discount site w00t, and am very happy with my purchase. That is two razors / handles and 30 replacement blades in all. Should last a good long time, and a pretty good deal, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these razors. The \\&quot;handle\\&quot; feels good in hand, is lightweight, and is easy to, well, handle! I find it grippy where it needs to be and sleek in all the right places. It&#x27;s also good looking. Modern, I would say. And what actually comes to mind is a refined looking piece of dental equipment. It looks surgical and clean. As said, like a little dental instrument. It&#x27;s kind of fancy and seems festooned with some....stuff. But for me it&#x27;s just a shaver. So rather then examine and nitpick like some reviewers, I just took it out of the package and started to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And i must say it feels similar and same to any other razor i have ever used, and is among the best i have used. I have no issues with the design, execution, or functionality of the product as a whole, and have no idea what issues anyone could have with this? The head pivots and bends or whatever.....but it seems like any other razor which does so. I have had no trouble shaving my face with this. All over my face. In fact I find it rather comfortable. The blades lay nicely and contour nicely with my face / skin and give a nice clean shave. I may have to \\&quot;work\\&quot; the position of the blade a bit more then a more conventional set up, but that seems par for the course with many razor designs. Big deal imo. This gives a nice, close, clean shave. And thats what I want. I do not have a thick beard but rather a wiry, scraggly, tough and grey one. It does not shave easily with many razors! This one tackles it no problem, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars and not 5 because this does not reinvent the mousetrap. I didn&#x27;t expect it to, but the way these things are marketed it seems THEY want us to believe it does somehow. But no. It&#x27;s no more effective then your quality 3 blade razor, and it feels much the same going over your face. I mean they can give us 5 blades and a fancy handle  but we don&#x27;t need &#x27;em, really. So i knock off one star for the hype of the blades and the \\&quot;design\\&quot; of the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s just another razor system. But it&#x27;s a good one and well worth the price, and especially worth a bargain price. A good razor can be hard to find for some. This is a good one for me. It might be for you, too :)</li>
    <li> I gave this razor five stars; it&#x27;s the best blade razor I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used &#x27;em all ... It took a few days to get used to how it works, but once that period passed, I was delighted ... the blade lasts at least as long as others I&#x27;ve used, and gives an excellent shave ... It is harder than I&#x27;m used to to replace the blade, but after you do it once or twice it&#x27;s a piece of cake ... I just bought some replacement blades because I&#x27;m concerned they won&#x27;t be available for long; I haven&#x27;t seen any advertising for the system and it&#x27;s not available at the grocery store we use or at the CVS in my town ... I got mine through Groupon for an excellent price and I&#x27;m hoping it will catch on ... both of my thumbs up ...</li>
    <li> Well, I bought this system via Woot, because, like lots of guys, I was sick of paying more than $20 for a few Mach 3 or Quattro blades.  Was hoping this system would work well, but was very disappointed.  My understanding is that this razor blade system was developed in the UK, and, supposedly, if very popular over there.  Only sold here in the U.S. in certain drug stores or online, I believe.  While this system is significantly cheaper than the top selling Mach 3 and Quattro systems, it really didn&#x27;t perform well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  Cheap (that&#x27;s it).  Wish I could say more, but thats all I got.  Maybe I could say it looks sort of slick, but that doesn&#x27;t equate to performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Odd shape.  \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; systems have a straight handle and the blade cartridge attaches to a downward bend.  With this system, the straight handle actually bends up at the end.  Very weird feel and hard to fit the contours of my face.  Very bulky blade head, and hard to get those small areas and fine tuning areas, such as near my nostrils or sideburn area.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the quality of the blades (I would assume so, since that is where the cost comes into play), but not a smooth shave.  Lots of drag.  Also, the angle and or spacing between the blades is such that hair gets clogged between the blades and is extremely difficult to remove.  I literally have to try to clean out the blades after each small swipe of my face.  The blade cartridge sits so precariously on the handle that any vigorous attempts to unclog the blades causes the cartridge to fall off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got to be honest, I&#x27;d get off cheaper and get a better shave by buying those large bags of disposable razors.  Oh well, I gave it the old college try.  Evidently, this system has SOME good reviews, so it might be worth buying one to see how it works for you.  I&#x27;ve got about 15 blades left and would prefer to throw them all away, but I&#x27;ll suffer through them for the next couple of weeks, if I can stand it.  After that, have to break out the wallet for the Mach 3:(  But, at least I know I&#x27;ll get a great shave and at least 3 to 5 days out of a cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for the effort, but that&#x27;s all I can give King of Shaves..  After that, have to break out the wallet for the Mach 3:(  But, at least I know I&#x27;ll get a great shave and at least 3 to 5 days out of a cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for the effort, but that&#x27;s all I can give King of Shaves.</li>
    <li> These have to be the worst razor I have ever used.  I thought for the price I would try them but what a mistake.  Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Feels great in your hand.  The back side is coated in rubber, and the front has a rubber strip as well, so I was able to hold it in my hand well.  It&#x27;s got heft to it.&lt;br /&gt;- Well, it sure looks fancy.&lt;br /&gt;- I got it as part of a pack, so I have so many razor packs that I could probably use it as a weapon in the eventual zombie apocalypse.&lt;br /&gt;- This lady&#x27;s cheap.  Temptingly cheap.  Resist this temptation, fellas; you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Poor head design, which sucks up and clogs with hair.  I&#x27;m no yeti; quite the opposite, I&#x27;m a blond haired guy who can go a week without shaving and have nobody notice.  Unfortunately , even in my case, the blade head was stuck up with hair almost immediately, and no amount of thrashing it about under the faucet would clean it out.  If it does this with my fair stubble, imagine what it&#x27;ll do your epic viking beard!  Are the blades sharp? I have no idea, because they couldn&#x27;t actually do their job.&lt;br /&gt;- That rubber on the handle that I mentioned? Yeah, if you get any water or cream on it, this razor will be slipping and sliding all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;- The handle seems to be backwards.  It sits against the face in a way that I&#x27;ve yet to see any other razor duplicate.  As others have mentioned, this could take some getting used to.  Given the other issues, I&#x27;m not giving it the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re under 16, don&#x27;t buy this razor.  Five blades seems tempting, but all this one will do is clog up and nip you should you give it the chance.  I switched to an old (and somewhat dull) disposable razor, and it finished the job.  I gave this razor a chance, I really did.  Pre-shave oil, a nice, old style cream, the whole nine yards.  I mean no offense, but this thing is going nowhere near my face again.  If you shave once every month when a few hairs crop up, then give this a go.  But for the rest of us, it won&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> It took me a few shaves to get used to the design of this razor. Unlike conventional razors, this razor lies flat. It&#x27;s supposed to give you a closer shave.I wouldn&#x27;t say that this razor provided the closest shave that I ever experienced, but for the price, it&#x27;s quite respectable. I don&#x27;t think, however, that the blade lasts longer than most other razors, contrary to advertising. Also, inserting a fresh blade wasn&#x27;t as easy as I thought it would be. Overall,though, it&#x27;s cheaper than many other razors, and delivers comparable performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was such a great review, I copied it!</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see all the negative reviews for this product. I bought this for my husband so I personally have never used it. He mentioned at first the style and design was &#x27;different&#x27; but once he figured all that out he prefers this over the standard ones he has used in the past. I have noticed that he has not cut himself shaving since he switched this... which is impressive in itself! He also feels the blades last longer. I guess you will just have to give it a try and see if it&#x27;s for you but he has really liked it.</li>
    <li> I got these at a low price from woot.com and figured I had nothing to lose.  But if a product does a horrible job, then how can a low price ever become a \\&quot;good deal\\&quot;?  I&#x27;ve never had a worse shave.  I feel slightly guilty that these razors are going to become so much landfill, but they&#x27;re not worth the wasted time to shave 3 times in order to get decently close to smooth; and even then, it&#x27;s near impossible to get under the nose, sideburns, and corners of your mouth / around your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I bought a razor and 15 Cartridges for around $13 and was so happy about the deal I got. It looked impressive. But my happiness lasted until I used it the first time. As soon as I held it, I felt it is off balance. However I started using it since I really hated paying too much for my shaving cartridges. After couple of shaves I found this:&lt;br /&gt;1. The razor is too off balace that it does not glide well through your face.&lt;br /&gt;2. The blades in cartridges are not properly placed and hence hair gets stuck between blades. It is too difficult to dislodge that. It feels like a pre-Mach 2 razor even though it has 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;3. The sharpness fades too fast. After the first shave it feels bad. It is unusable after the second shave. Compare that to Mach 3 which can get me at least 10 enjoyable shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> A close shave is almost impossible with this difficult to use product. You must hold the cartridge down against your skin in order to get most of the hair off yor face. Great price but you&#x27;ll want to throw out these terrible flexible razors after one or two attempts to use them.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks and try this razor.  Wish I would have read some of the previous reviews first.  For an infrequent shaver like myself (I don&#x27;t shave every day... usually have 2 or 3 days of whiskers to get through), this razor is awful.  It does not shave close at all and it&#x27;s tough to get to those tricky spots (under the nose..).  The blade gets clogged easily and if you try and give it a bang against the sink to clean it out, the blades pop right out from the razor.  Before I&#x27;m even done with 1 shave, the blades are useless.  So much for their claim that they will last longer than the normal blade.  Water constantly runs down your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had any of these problems with my Gillette fusion, but I thought I&#x27;d try something else.  I&#x27;m not even going to finish using the 2 packs of 6 blades that I have left.  I thought I&#x27;d throw them in with the stuff I donate to good causes, but why would I want to give this crap to anyone else to deal with?  In the garbage this is going.  Save your money and run!</li>
    <li> For gifts I purchased three packages and extra blades from Woot. Worst razor I ever used for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. When wet the handle is too slick to hold on to (I shave in the shower)&lt;br /&gt;2. On a two day growth the razor glides over my face. Unfortunately it also glides right over the whiskers without cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;3. A lot of force is required to get the blades to make contact with the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;4. The blades quickly packed with whiskers &amp; shave cream that did not easily rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted King of Shaves (UK company) about the problems they were very apologetic and sent some of their shaving gels and oils, which work really well. I was also told that Remington is no longer a distributor for their product in the U.S. and an improved razor is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raised my rating to two. If you shave everyday the Azor razor will do a decent job. You will still need to press harder than other razors, but the shave beats cheap disposables.</li>
    <li> I tried this as a cheaper alternate to my habitual Mach 3.  I have a short cropped beard and mustache and found the \\&quot;Azor\\&quot; does not do well with tricky details.  The shaving surface is very tall (or wide if you prefer) because there are so many blades staked up.  So it creates a large flat surface that is hard to get to conform to the contours of your face.  The end result was noticeably less close shave, lot&#x27;s of stubble left over, even with brand new blades.  And no, they don&#x27;t last any longer.  They get clogged up and worn out as fast, or faster, than the Mach 3.  So it&#x27;s back to the expensive, but better blades for me ...</li>
    <li> I bought it elsewhere for the cost which was unbeatable and to replace the Mach 5 which in my mind is way too expensive. Unfortunately, this razor delivers a shave which is terrible - a few hours after shaving I see stubble showing up so that by noon, I have a \\&quot;evening\\&quot; shadow. Also, hair gets stuck between the blades and because of the design is impossible to wash out so I recommend you keep a toothbrush handy and use it to clean out the blades.</li>
    <li> The Remington Azor razor provides a close and smooth shave. The cartridge blades are easy to replace. The handle of the razor could be longer if you have a large hand but it is overall adequate. I would recommend this razor to anyone looking for a manual razor.</li>
    <li> Razors are expensive for men and women. I got 3 sets of these on sale because they were too good to pass up even though the reviews were mostly negative even on UK sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, these have worked perfectly for my legs and underarms. I&#x27;ve had no issues whatsoever. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a smooth glide as you&#x27;re shaving but when you&#x27;re done. it&#x27;s a very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor did I have any problems with the blade getting clogged. Possibly because, in general, men shave more often and also have coarser hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the flex in the blade, that&#x27;s a plus for me. It maneuvers around delicate areas and curves much better than a standard razor (any I&#x27;ve ever used). I usually nick my ankle bone but that has been completely eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it for more private areas and that also worked out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I can say, as a woman, that I recommend this razor. The price cannot be beat for the starter set and replacement razors.</li>
    <li> I picked up a special deal for this razor with a total of 15 replacement heads.  I have been using the shaver for a couple weeks now and I feel sorry for whatever country proclaims this the \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot;.  Perhaps everyone in that country is happy with stubble after shaving.  Regularly I use either a Schick Hydro or Quattro, but couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal.  The razors are difficult to clean and I end up going over my face three times, once with the grain, once at 90 degrees to the grain and a third pass against the grain.  All this just to get the closeness that I get with a single pass with other razors.  As I write this review however, I can feel some rough area on my neck that I must have someone missed one of the required passes of the shaver.  I will continue to use the razor simply because I have 15 cartridges, but I will switch back to one of the other razors if I don&#x27;t have the time to work with the Remington JESTER of Shaves.  I might not even get through all 15 replacement heads before throwing in the towel and tossing the Remington in the trash.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this shaver because of the design. However, I tried it for a week and hated it. It would not clean properly and never felt like it was giving me the kind of close shave I got with the Quattro. It was especially bad for shaving my head, which I do twice a week. It just could not handle the curves. I threw the shaver and the rest of the replacement blades away.</li>
    <li> The escalating war of razor blades has gone too far.  2 were good. 3 was a little much.  4 was silly.  Now they have the Remington with 5 blades.  And it sucks.  I ordered this when it was on super-duper-sale over at Woot, and it really sucks.  I have a normal face, normal facial hair, and yet after a 2 day weekend of not shaving, this thing leaves huge patches of missed stubble all over my face.  Even if I go over and over my chin with the KING OF SHAVE, still stubble remains.  So now I shave while in the shower, then get out and fire up my electric razor to clean up all the missed spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a name as stupid as \\&quot;KING OF SHAVE\\&quot;, you know it has to suck.</li>
    <li> Use the proper shaving technique will give you a smooth, easy shave.  From the feel of it you&#x27;ll think the blades are not cutting, but you&#x27;ll hear it.  The proper technique is to put the pressure on the bumper, not on the blades.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor because it was such a great deal I could not refuse it. When I used it, it was the equivalent of using one of those dollar store razor packages the kind you get 5 razors for a dollar.  I figured I would at least get through a week of Shaving with each cartridge. But I could not even get halfway through one shave with a brand new cartridge.  It pulled and grabbed and was the most uncomfortable experience ever.  I threw the whole thing away.  A complete waste of time and money very disappointed.  Beware everyone!</li>
    <li> As others have noted, it&#x27;s hard to apply any pressure - it&#x27;s too flexible.  But worst of all, I can&#x27;t get through an entire shave without the being entirely clogged with whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried it - put in a brand new blade, lathered up, and got half of my face shaved before it lost all efficacy.  The blades are just too close together, so there&#x27;s no good way to rinse it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to disposables.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the low price assuming a 5 blade would be cutting edge technology. I have had 2 &amp; 3 blsde throw-a-ways that gave better shaves. When I use up all the blades that came with this thing - the handlke will get thrown away &amp; go back to a 3 blade.</li>
    <li> Wow.  I am surprised at all the negative reviews of this razor.  I bought one and a TON of cartridges from an ACO Hardware store that was selling for 70% off.  I think it works better for me than any other razor, including the Fusion.  I will not have to buy any more outrageously priced cartridges for at least 4 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a cheaper replacement for my Gillette, this didn&#x27;t even come close. As a 58 year old Black man I have to be careful shaving, to avoid hair bumps.. using this razor I have to keep going over areas,and found myself pressing harder. I found this razor online with 3 replacement blades and 2 five packs, for less that the Gillette 4 pac replacement. I will be giving them away. they Suck.</li>
    <li> yes, I remember getting this stiff, rigid, hard to use razor. what was I thinking buying this? I gave it away to the first person who would take it. I forget who but I think it was a chick who wound up using it for her legs. Who knows, better than the trash I guess...didn&#x27;t hear anything negative about the legs to I gave it an extra charity star. a giveaway/throwaway</li>
    <li> Rare for me to dislike a product this much. I&#x27;m in my fifties and shave my face and head, and can say that this product is historically awful. Shaves badly, clogs easily. Best thing I can say about it is I&#x27;m not getting nicks. May be inexpensive, but so what if these blades are so bad I just want to throw them out.</li>
    <li> Sucks just like the blades</li>
    <li> TOTAL GARBAGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to say that I bought these and used them and they are terrible. Really crap. DO NOT PURCHASE! They don&#x27;t give a good shave, hair gets stuck between the blades and is impossible to remove making them useless after one shave, the head does not flex nearly enough to shave along the neck, and the blades continually fall off the handle. Ugh.</li>
    <li> Seriously, these razor blades gave me one of the worst uneven shaves I ever experienced. The blades also clog up if you have a thick beard, and are a pain to clean out. My wife didn&#x27;t have any better luck shaving her legs with them, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can get a better shave from the generic twin blade disposable razors that you can get in a 5 pack at the drug store. Those cost about 1/3rd as much as these do, even when they are on sale!</li>
    <li> Actually I rate it a 0, since I can&#x27;t even use the product any longer!  I purchased this product and two boxes of cartridges.  What a mistake.  The second time I used it, I dropped it in the shower and one of the prongs that holds the cartridges in place broke.  So, the Razor won&#x27;t hold the cartridges anymore.  I wrote to Remington and here&#x27;s the answer I received \\&quot;Thank you for your message.  We are sorry to inform you that we no longer distribute the item you speak of. For any further assistants you would want to go to shave.com, which is now the official website for king of shaves. Please let us know if we can assist you further.\\&quot;  So now I get to contact shave.com.  How&#x27;s that for customer service?  Crappy!  Don&#x27;t buy from Remington!!</li>
    <li> This has to be THE WORST multi-bladed razor ever conceived. The handle and angles are awkward to use at BEST, the cartridge is almost impossible to clean/rinse between strokes, and makes your shave take about 3x as long as it would take with any other razor (even the cheap 2 blade disposables).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY good things about this razor are: it&#x27;s small enough to just throw it away into a small bathroom receptacle and that I find it nearly impossible to cut yourself. How do I know this? Because of how hard you need to press it to even cut one hair and I haven&#x27;t been sliced yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the title of my review has conveyed... 1 star is too generous for this piece of trash. Call this a lesson learned on my part. Don&#x27;t skimp on price because you never know what you are going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have been warned... stick with what you know. I, for one, will be going back to the Mach 3(tm).</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor form a discount site and was excited to have many replacement blades at a great price. I figured I would be good for a couple years.&lt;br /&gt;My initial shave was uncomfortable, with the poor design and balance of the handle it just never felt right and the shave itself was painful. I could have forgiven some discomfort if I had actually got a close shave but unfortunately that was not the case. My face was still stubbly (is that a word?) after the shave despite multiple painful passes over it. Forget about skipping shaving for the weekend- trying to remove a few days of growth was unbearable. Replacing the blade with new ones did not improve the situation.&lt;br /&gt;Being stubborn and cheap I tried to stick with the razor but after a few weeks I just gave up and threw the whole pile of blades and handles away.&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the agony and avoid this product at all costs. I would not use these even if they were free.</li>
