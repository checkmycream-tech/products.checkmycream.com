<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased this for the first time at a Macy&#x27;s department store and paid $90 for it. When I ran out I went looking for La Fleur, but did not want to spend $90 for a bottle. I found this one and received it very quickly! I would have given it 5 stars, however, when I opened the sealed box I noticed that the color of the perfume was a yellow color (the perfume in my original bottle was clear with no color to it). When I sprayed it I found that the scent to be overpowered with alcohol. The alcohol scent does dissipate, but I never had this issue with the one that I bought from Macy&#x27;s. I would buy it again because once the alcohol scent goes away I love the smell and the price. I am happy with this product for the most part. Super happy about how quickly it got to me!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell the best</li>
    <li> Love it and received it veryquickly</li>
    <li> On time...product as described...happy daughter!</li>
    <li> I love all juicy scents but this one doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I will stick with the other ones!</li>
    <li> CAME AS DESCRIBED, IT WAS AN AMAZING BUY AS WELL, A LOT CHEAPER THAN THE MALL,</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect about this purchase! The price, packaging and delivery. Will definitely reorder again.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful! biggest bottle of cologne in the vanity! definately would highly recommend to someone who likes a subtly sweet, with delicate spices smell.</li>
    <li> Like what I said. Normally it can only last for the morning and I have to put it on again.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE MY FRAGRANCE! WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it, shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!!  Great price too!!  Would buy again and again!  Lasts a long time and smells really nice!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it and I the savvy shopper am her hero.  Other reviewers threw me off a bit by, describing it as a good but flawed buy, the perfume isn&#x27;t clear like the kind in the stores no, and while some may detect a hint of alcohol or whatever my girlfriend did not.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff smells amazing! Amazon pricing comes through again! Juicy website was selling it for like $90. Love it when my wife wears this. She loves it too. And the big bottle will last her quiet a while which is a plus. Def would buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> My woman loves this perfume.  I almost bought at the store for 3 times the cost.  Thankfully she recommended purchasing through Amazon.</li>
    <li> will buy again fast service as seen on screen great value will recommend to friends and family thanks for offering it</li>
    <li> For those saying it smells like alcohol at first and isn&#x27;t \\&quot;what I smelled at Macys\\&quot; well what you smelled at Macys was an eau de parfume, this is an eau de toilette. That means this contains more alcohol and less fragrance. Think body spray or spash vs perfume. If you don&#x27;t like an overpowering amount of scent that might be better for you, or if you want the scent but for cheaper. Companies very often put out both toilette and parfume.</li>
    <li> I have never bought this perfume at a brand name store. I bought this based on reviews from Light Blue(my fav), because I was looking for another perfume that smelled great.  The smell is nice, but it seems like it only lasts for maybe an hour... It could just be me, but I wish the smell would last longer on me, because it does smell really good...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. The price was a great value for the size. Also, the product was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> i really love the smell of this perfume but sadly it doesn&#x27;t last long. Probably will get viva la juicy next time</li>
    <li> I do like this product but I feel like the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  Not sure if it is watered down or what.</li>
    <li> love this perfume! and I got it sooner then expected.</li>
    <li> the spray itself doesn&#x27;t last the entire day but that&#x27;s what i like about it. it&#x27;s a huge bottle so i don&#x27;t know when i&#x27;ll ever get through it. but the price was right!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume. Unfortunately the smell wears off quickly and have to sprits up again during the day. I would purchase it again even with that issue because it smells so good. I hope Juicy works out this issue.</li>
    <li> This is a scent that I would definitely buy again. Beautiful and soft floral fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume! I wear it daily and the scent lasts all day. I get asked a lot by people what I&#x27;m wearing!. It&#x27;s not too strong to wear daily either.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother  and she loved it. It smells really good and lasts all day! I would definitely purchase this for myself!</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for, smells amazing and this is the best price I could find. And this big of a bottle will last for a long while</li>
    <li> This can not be the real stuff. I received a sample from a cosmetic store and I just LOVED it! The scent lasted all day and even after swimming I could still smell it. This barley last a few hours. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not the more expensive of the two Viva La Juicy perfumes but my girlfriend loved it because she has already had the other. Both smell good but slightly different</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girlfriend for Christmas and she really enjoys the smell I like it as well I had to buy her another bottle already</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance more than the other Juicy perfumes I&#x27;ve tried. This fragrance still has some fruity undertones, but the base is much more floral. I wish it lasted longer, though.</li>
    <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW! I ORDERED THIS ON FEB. 4 AND GOT IT TODAY IM REALLY HAPPY. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT MY PURCHASE. THATS WHY I GAVE 5 STARS.</li>
    <li> Love my perfume! I tried it out as soon and I received it and it smells amazing!!! The shipping was super fast too! I received it within 2 days! I am very happy with the shipper and the product!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Really nice and not toooo much!</li>
    <li> I was so SUPER  impressed with the size of the bottle. The bottle is exactly like the one I bought from Sephora.  But I have to agree with some of the others here that say it doesn&#x27;t last long. As far as keeping it, I will use it all up! Just wished it lasted longer! :)</li>
    <li> As long as the Juicy pefume I purchased at Macy&#x27;s. The price was definetely better, but not too sure about the quality</li>
    <li> I love it, my only issue is it doesn&#x27;t seem to last on my clothing or body. I&#x27;m not sure if I got the right kind, I&#x27;ve been told there is a difference between a perfume and toilette spray.  But otherwise love it.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery...great product! I would definitely recommend to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> This smells just like fruit punch with a kick. The bottle is very elegent and the bottle is huge! 5 oz. will last you forever!</li>
    <li> This is my go to perfume and it seems to smell good on everyone when it mixed with your body&#x27;s oils. I may have gotten a defective one though, the spray cap just snapped off of mine when I was trying to spray it so I&#x27;ve got a full bottle of perfume and no way to get the fragrance out.</li>
    <li> Was delivered in a timely fashion.  A gift for my daughter.  She was happy to have the scent.</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells so good. It&#x27;s light but still packs in a punch, in the best of ways. I bought it for my niece, because she loved mine, so getting Christmas shopping started. No doubt she will be ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was fast and the product came well protected. It&#x27;s a very pretty bottle, just like the picture. It&#x27;s actually quite larger than I expected. You won&#x27;t be sorry, it&#x27;s a great purchase from a great seller. A win, win for all!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!!</li>
    <li> What a deal! Nice size bottle for an awesome price!</li>
    <li> Love it. This is my wife&#x27;s perfume. Great price. Item arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Seems as if the perfume may be old.  Fragrance doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long like a bottle I previously purchased at a dept. store.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of this perfume and was very surprised how big the bottle actually was. Worth the money spent!!</li>
    <li> I have worn this cologne before and loved it.  However the fragrance in this bottle does not last once applied to skin.  It&#x27;s as if it has been watered down.  I should have been suspicious at the so-called great price of $65 when it is $90 in the department stores.  I am wondering if the cologne was worn, returned, and filled with water for resale.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance; doesn&#x27;t seem to last however!!</li>
    <li> Great price,  smells good as well I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Bought this at macys, this could have been my new favorite perfume, the smell is divine, a great floral scent, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last long, i didn&#x27;t realize it was a toilette spray which is similar to a mist, so i will be exchanging for the viva la juicy  perfume tommorrow,I hope the le fleur becomes a pefume soon, which lasts longer and not just in toilette water</li>
    <li> This is either fake or verrrrry old. I&#x27;ve had this perfume before and it&#x27;s definitely not the same. One star cause I had no choice to mark none</li>
    <li> My all time fav perfume is Viva La Juicy, this is just as good!! I am so happy with this &amp; I smell so good! If you like the original Viva then you will like this!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!  Smells amazing.  Using it daily.  Best price I&#x27;ve found and thankfully too!  Spoiled myself with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and it is half the price of Kohls.</li>
    <li> I received  the product as expected....these will be gifts so I can not attest  to the quality...yhe box is factory sealed and appears to be the real deal!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff my son&#x27;s girlfriend will wear I&#x27;ve priced it everywere, this is the best price and the largest bottle we could find!!</li>
    <li> Compared to my previous bottle that I purchased from Macy&#x27;s, this perfume is more like a body splash, it&#x27;s extremely light....After the inital spray, it smells like I&#x27;ve had it on for an hour!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t misunderstand me, I love a good smelling woman, but when she wears this, she stops me in my tracks.  Intoxicating.</li>
    <li> YES I BOUGHT THIS PERFUME AND ONESTELLY ITS FADE WAY IN MINUTE AFTER YOU SPRAY IT ON. DEFENETELLY NOT WORTH THE PRICE. BUT THATS THE CHANSE YOU TAKE WHEN YOU BUY PERFUME OR FRANGANCES FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES.  TOO BAD I FELT FOR IT.</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful &amp; lasts a long time. I&#x27;ve bought several other Juicy perfumes from another place &amp; sometimes it smells right &amp; other times it doesn&#x27;t. Super pleased to have found these sellers. Quality product! Will do business with again.</li>

    <li> Great deal, arrived really fast and I just love it!</li>
    <li> The perfume I received smelled off and had a very strong alcohol smell, I don&#x27;t think this is a genuine product.</li>
    <li> everything was awesome no comlaints!</li>

    <li> I have all the juicy Couture perfumes and this is a great Sent!</li>
    <li> The package was delivered opened and the bottom was wet</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this scent. I first smelled it at Sephora and knew I had to get it, but for a better price. The only negative thing I have to say is that the scent wears off rather quickly- in about 5 hrs. I spray it on my clothes so that the scent lingers longer, which it does. You cannot beat the price for this size bottle! I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> I thought this was the .5 oz I usually get at a department store... Holy cow 5oz I was pleasantly surprised! Great deal I was used to paying $40 for .5oz this was a smokin deal</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present and the item was broken;  so disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, I&#x27;ve bought it from a department store before.&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, the scent lasts only 30 minutes. I practically bathe in it, and then&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t smell it.  Maybe just a bunk batch...? It was in original packaging, shipped well...&lt;br /&gt;No complaints other than the rapidly fading scent.</li>
