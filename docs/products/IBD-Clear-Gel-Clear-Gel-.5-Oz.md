      <li>this is soooo good.  </li>
      <li>so I can manicure my own nails.</li>
      <li>Ever since I started doing my own nails (got to be to costly) ...</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: after wearing this stuff on my nails for many months now I have noticed that there is some tarnishing or darkening on one or two of my nails, so that if you didn&#x27;t wear polish they would not look so good.</li>
      <li>but I liked the ease of use</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m super happy.</li>
      <li>This is working, and doing a fill is very easy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>one can do your nails better than you, it may take practice but it sure makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you just have to make sure that after you cure the nail with the UV light, you wipe off the tacky residue with the \\&quot;cleanser</li>
      <li>Make sure you cure it with your UV light between each coat.</li>
      <li>easy to work with..</li>
      <li>Easy to remove</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>easy to use and &amp;#34;stir-ring&amp;#34; before use will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very excited to try my own gel nails - yea, it does work good and it does dry under the UV light</li>
      <li>it is new unopened  product is as in the nail places I would recommend this just get a good uv gel lamp</li>
      <li>I used this with tips and it came out just fine.</li>
      <li>I am happy to have found a sealer named &amp;#34;ibd.&amp;#34; My Aquarium Nails will look fantastic once they have the proper gel!</li>
      <li>this gel make my nails so smooth</li>
      <li>It dries to a smooth shiny finish.</li>
      <li>I bought a cheap LED light (Kiss brand at Walgreens $30.00) for this DIY.</li>
      <li>Takes a lot to smooth it out.</li>
      <li>Wipes (lint free) to wipe off sticky residue after cured&lt;br /&gt;Rough File and Smoother</li>
      <li>My mani is chip free.</li>
      <li>You will need to use a lint free cotton pad with rubbing alochol to clean off the sticky residue.</li>
      <li>I received gel fast but to me it seems like it could have been filled more</li>
      <li>All these gel brands have their quirks but they are pretty easy to use with practice.</li>
      <li>I will add that it must be used with a good UV lamp or it won&#x27;t dry; but that is with any gel.</li>
      <li>The product dried very easily with this light although I did cure twice as the light is cheap.</li>
      <li>The application is smooth, but the product is really sticky.</li>
      <li>I am reading the &amp;#34;comments&amp;#34; and they all sound promising</li>
      <li>Work okay for natural nails.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite by far.</li>
      <li>They made it right</li>
      <li>There aren&#x27;t bubbles, if you apply it right.</li>
      <li>I will use this product again and will likely buy it again, you get way more product for the dollar with this vs the bottled GEL FOUNDATIONS.</li>
      <li>I bought it to try out my first DIY gel nails.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I bought online and the product does not adhere to my nails.</li>
      <li>Because the first one I got was opened and the gel was inside of the envelope and everywhere else.</li>
      <li>Now this is my first time using &amp;#34;ibd&amp;#34; for my Aquarium Nails.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to paint it on just like nail polish and then cure it for a few minutes in the UV light.</li>
      <li>I was very upset...</li>
      <li>i use it all the time when i do my daughters nails very shiny as well just dont forget to remove the sticky residue</li>
      <li>and I appreciated that.</li>
      <li>It is very shiny and holds up well.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really cure at all....</li>
      <li>I already had a different model, older UV light.  </li>
      <li>I used REGULAR nail polish and a universal GEL top coat.</li>
      <li>Rubbing alcohol does the same exact thing and you can get it for 98¢ at Kroger!</li>
      <li>When I emailed the seller and told them, they shipped a new one to my house immediately.</li>
      <li>I am very busy...</li>
      <li>My nails look very natural.</li>
      <li>I have very weak nails and am always looking for an easy way to keep them strong.</li>
      <li>There is a little stickiness afterwards, but is easily handled by a smear of rubbing alcohol.</li>
      <li>but it is still very sticky after several hours.</li>
      <li>I use this gel for natural nail overlays, and to build out the edge a bit when one nail is shorter than the others.</li>
      <li>I think all gel should be in a typical nail polish bottle for easy application considering that gel is such a sticky product.</li>
      <li>and they said let it sit and let the gel fall back down WHAT??\\&quot; To me for 11dollars there should have been more inside just go ahead and buy the bigger size...</li>
      <li>You only need a tiny bit its nice and thick.</li>
      <li>After searching out and trying multiple products for doing my own fake nails, I think I have finally found &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34</li>
      <li>this gel took forever to dry under UV light, thick and goes on clumpy.  </li>
      <li>I did get a very little burn sensation at first during curing, but I have read that is due to normal shrinkage of the gel.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Someone gave this product a bad review saying that it never dries, even with a UV dryer.....It does work.....you just have to make sure that after you cure the nail with the UV light, you wipe off the tacky residue with the \\&quot;cleanser plus\\&quot;. I LOVE the gel system by IBD. It&#x27;s one of the easier systems to use and it applies a lot easier, to me.</li>
    <li> Gel was a bit dried out but still useable</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really cure at all....i have the led lamp from Sensationail.  So the lamp should be in good quality. but unfortunately, the gel wont cure n it stays in liquid.  i am very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I have purchased and used this stuff. It is so easy to paint it on just like nail polish and then cure it for a few minutes in the UV light. There is a little stickiness afterwards, but is easily handled by a smear of rubbing alcohol. It dries to a smooth shiny finish. I did get a very little burn sensation at first during curing, but I have read that is due to normal shrinkage of the gel. I have very weak nails and am always looking for an easy way to keep them strong. This is working, and doing a fill is very easy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: after wearing this stuff on my nails for many months now I have noticed that there is some tarnishing or darkening on one or two of my nails, so that if you didn&#x27;t wear polish they would not look so good. If you do the acetone in a thick napkin or cotton, wrapped with foil or duct tape for half and hour, it starts to peel off and you can clip it away, to start over. That is what they mean by \\&quot;soak off\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> this is soooo good.  I love this gel.  it have been doing acrylic for years and decided I wanted to see how this works.  I can tell you this.  I don&#x27;t want to ever go back to acrylic.  this gel make my nails so smooth and I have had my polish on for about a week now and no chips.  with the uv light, bonder, primer I am good to go. the price and package make it even better. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future</li>
    <li> this gel took forever to dry under UV light, thick and goes on clumpy.  Takes a lot to smooth it out.</li>
    <li> This product is good for nothing! Whatever time I spend trying to dry up - it just does not dry! Ever! With the help of the proper U-ray devise - doesn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Nada a dizer contra.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;Eacute; um &amp;oacute;timo produto na aplicação e muito resistente&lt;br /&gt;Não amarelece.&lt;br /&gt;Aconselho vivamente</li>
    <li> I saw this product in a you tube tutorial. It definitly captured my attention. I bought it to try out my first DIY gel nails. I bought a cheap LED light (Kiss brand at Walgreens $30.00) for this DIY. The product dried very easily with this light although I did cure twice as the light is cheap. You will need to use a lint free cotton pad with rubbing alochol to clean off the sticky residue. I used REGULAR nail polish and a universal GEL top coat. My mani is chip free. I will use this product again and will likely buy it again, you get way more product for the dollar with this vs the bottled GEL FOUNDATIONS. It is very shiny and holds up well. I&#x27;m going to invest in a good 36w UV light and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be even happier as I won&#x27;t have to cure twice. I&#x27;m giving it a three only because I&#x27;ve only used it twice.</li>
    <li> Gel worked wonderfully well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use and &amp;#34;stir-ring&amp;#34; before use will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cured 6 minutes under UV 36 watt lamp using kiss nail glue to attach a french nails.&lt;br /&gt;Learning to use the product correctly while watching &amp;#62;you-tube videos, made all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one can do your nails better than you, it may take practice but it sure makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UV Lamp 36 Watt&lt;br /&gt;Nail Gel&lt;br /&gt;Nail Cutting Tool&lt;br /&gt;Small Square Brush (you can re-use many times)&lt;br /&gt;Baby Wipes (lint free) to wipe off sticky residue after cured&lt;br /&gt;Rough File and Smoother file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more trips to the salon -- nor lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied Customer!</li>
    <li> I bought the ibd starter kit.  I already had a different model, older UV light.  But I have had no problems using these products or getting my nails to dry. I am not a professional but I liked the ease of use so I can manicure my own nails.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it. Excellent buy, easy to use. Outstanding product I should have purchased more. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try my own gel nails - yea, it does work good and it does dry under the UV light but after a day or so it turns into a yellow haze. And i only noticed because i ordered another brand and applied it on my ring finger. ~Claudia~</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this for my nails but to glue my 3d art - works well and seals the art after it&#x27;s cured!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I am NOT a professional nail technician. I use this gel for natural nail overlays, and to build out the edge a bit when one nail is shorter than the others. I wear them short and I like the added strength and gloss this gel provides. I cure it in an inexpensive LED lamp manufactured for home use, 2 minutes seems to work. YMMV. All these gel brands have their quirks but they are pretty easy to use with practice. My nails look very natural. This is my favorite by far.</li>
    <li> I am reading the &amp;#34;comments&amp;#34; and they all sound promising🌹 Now this is my first time using &amp;#34;ibd&amp;#34; for my Aquarium Nails. I need a sealer. I just purchased it and waiting for it! I am happy to have found a sealer named &amp;#34;ibd.&amp;#34; My Aquarium Nails will look fantastic once they have the proper gel!</li>
    <li> I use this to build my Gel nails and have never had any issues or problems with it. Very Nice product!</li>
    <li> Work okay for natural nails.</li>
    <li> After searching out and trying multiple products for doing my own fake nails, I think I have finally found &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34; I am not a professional nail tech and I got very tired of having my nail bed drilled through by careless nail mills (no offense to those of you who take your craft seriously and care whether your customer is in pain). I did my nails 11 days ago and they still look fresh and bright. Because the product is thin and clear, you can&#x27;t really see where they grow out. The growth gap is a pet peeve of mine so I&#x27;m super happy. I had one nail pop off after 2 days but I think it was user error. I don&#x27;t think I properly filed and primed that finger. I redid it and haven&#x27;t had any other problems. Make sure you cure it with your UV light between each coat. If you&#x27;re going to paint them with gel polish, do not remove the sticky residue. There is no need to even file these nails if you&#x27;re careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two notes&lt;br /&gt;1) I used this with tips and it came out just fine. I used 4 coats&lt;br /&gt;2) You do not need to buy expensive &amp;#34;cleaners&amp;#34; to take the sticky residue off of this product or any gel product. Rubbing alcohol does the same exact thing and you can get it for 98¢ at Kroger!</li>
    <li> You have to be very careful with this product. Takes time to get used to it.</li>
    <li> Also great really lasts.</li>
    <li> I received this item opened and almost empty...I was very upset...didn&#x27;t return it back coz I am very busy...&lt;br /&gt;I will never order online again....even the acrylic system i got did not look like the pic I saw...it was like sample buttle...very small,,</li>
    <li> Very nice product. Easy to use. I WILL USE AGAIN AND AGAIN. Easy to remove I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> The product never dries, it stays sticky for hours.  I have tried the ultra violet machine and blowing drying but it is still very sticky after several hours.</li>
    <li> this product is as said  it is new unopened  product is as in the nail places I would recommend this just get a good uv gel lamp so it will dry</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but my manicurist uses it and I love it.  I&#x27;m sure that I will love it.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started doing my own nails (got to be to costly) ...I have been using this product...easy to work with..long lasting...product is great...will order more.</li>
    <li> I was extremely disappointed in this product!  It is so stiff that I have to scrape it out of the jar.  Will never never buy this brand of products again.  It was a total waste of my money.  I can&#x27;t believe it ever received a good recommendation.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely sticky. The application is smooth, but the product is really sticky. I think all gel should be in a typical nail polish bottle for easy application considering that gel is such a sticky product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I bought online and the product does not adhere to my nails. I would not buy again</li>
    <li> I love this gel. I&#x27;ve ordered it before. I&#x27;m currently waiting on this product. Because the first one I got was opened and the gel was inside of the envelope and everywhere else. When I emailed the seller and told them, they shipped a new one to my house immediately. They made it right and I appreciated that. I would definitely order this gel again from here.&lt;br /&gt;About the gel, it&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve bought lots of different, \\&quot;better\\&quot; Brands of gels, OPI, EZ Flow, SuperNail..and this is the best one out of them all. It&#x27;s always even. There aren&#x27;t bubbles, if you apply it right. No chipping. The shine is wonderful. And it stays shiny until you take your nails off. I love it.</li>
    <li> this is a good product but I found it dificult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;A gel with a brush as top coat&lt;br /&gt;do the same work.</li>
    <li> Very good for over the natural nail i use it all the time when i do my daughters nails very shiny as well just dont forget to remove the sticky residue</li>
    <li> This leaks everywhere. I&#x27;ve lost half of the gel from the lid leaking. Not thrilled with the fact that this happened.</li>
    <li> I received gel fast but to me it seems like it could have been filled more there was a small amount inside also the lid was sticky so I contacted the seller and they said let it sit and let the gel fall back down WHAT??\\&quot; To me for 11dollars there should have been more inside just go ahead and buy the bigger size...but it works well</li>
    <li> I used this product and loved it. You only need a tiny bit its nice and thick. I will add that it must be used with a good UV lamp or it won&#x27;t dry; but that is with any gel. It gives that nice lacquer shine and click sound that we girls all love. Also a FYI that after apply and dry you must rub excess gel off with acetone on a swab to take stickiness off and shows that luxury shine!</li>
