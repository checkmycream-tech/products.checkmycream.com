      <li>This color is very pretty</li>
      <li>so pretty, esactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>and it is nice for a french layering coat.</li>
      <li>Funny Bunny is by far my favorite color.</li>
      <li>I love this color for doing a more natural French Manicure.</li>
      <li>Depending on personal preference, both are great for French Manicure.</li>
      <li>It is a soft white that will look like beautiful natural nails combined with a nude tone.</li>
      <li>I prefer funny bunny and will give the alpine snow to a friend.</li>
      <li>Came really fast.</li>
      <li>Just what I&#x27;ve been searching for...a light, white, opaque color.</li>
      <li>But its not as opaque as the picture makes it seem its very watery and transparent still at 3 coats.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>you need a least 3-4 coats of it in order for the color to come out nice.</li>
      <li>Delicate and nice.</li>
      <li>You have to apply several coats to get the color pictured and it doesnt dry very quick or set very well.</li>
      <li>Very professional for my vocation as a physician.</li>
      <li>Funny Bunny goes on sheer, so it will take up to three coats if you want an opaque look.  </li>
      <li>The photo IMO doesn&#x27;t represent the natural look I achieve on my olive skin tone.</li>
      <li>exactly as expected, thanks</li>

<li> I use 3 coats and it covers with just a hint of transparency which makes it look natural not &amp;#34;painted&amp;#34; on like other opaque colors.</li>
<li> It is white, with a hint of pink to it.  </li>
<li> Not opaque, but not clear.  </li>
<li> If you bump it even 30 minutes later it will dent bc of all the layers you have to apply, other than that I like the color</li>
<li> but when applying too much, it creates air bubbles and when the polish dries up, you can also see all the air bubbles... very hard to apply</li>
<li> It does require at least 3 coats to completely cover nails.</li>
<li> but unfortunately you&#x27;ll need about 3-5 coats before it starts to look like the right shade.</li>
<li> sheerer than expected!</li>
<li> I have tried to use other pale colors and I always return to this one.</li>
<li> Takes a few coats.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s the color i wanted but poor quality.  </li>
<li> but i&#x27;m disappointed with this purchased..</li>

    <li> Delicate and nice. Not opaque. Takes a few coats. Advise one coat of white white and then this as a second coat for extra depth.</li>
    <li> LOVE!! One of my favorite nail polishes!!</li>
    <li> Love the service and the price was also good. Seeing the picture with polish being used is a great help to determine color.  Really is a wonderful color.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This color goes with everything. Very clean and neutral.</li>
    <li> Came really fast. But its not as opaque as the picture makes it seem its very watery and transparent still at 3 coats. if i do any more itll look too cakey.</li>

    <li> i love OPI nail polishes but i&#x27;m disappointed with this purchased.. it&#x27;s the color i wanted but poor quality.  because the polish itself is watery... you need a least 3-4 coats of it in order for the color to come out nice. but when applying too much, it creates air bubbles and when the polish dries up, you can also see all the air bubbles... very hard to apply</li>
    <li> I love this color for doing a more natural French Manicure. It is a soft white that will look like beautiful natural nails combined with a nude tone. I also have alpine snow, which gives a more flashy look (it is as white as a sheet of paper). I prefer funny bunny and will give the alpine snow to a friend. Depending on personal preference, both are great for French Manicure.</li>
    <li> Great color.  Not opaque, but not clear.  Perfect for summer!</li>
    <li> I love this color for any season.  It is white, with a hint of pink to it.  It does require at least 3 coats to completely cover nails.</li>

    <li> exactly as expected, thanks</li>
    <li> Love this color.  It looks great on finger and toe nails.  Perfect crisp clean summer color.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect summer nail color.  It is used in salons for the &amp;#34;American&amp;#34; version of the French Manicure.  Looks just like the photo.  Mine was very fresh and went on easily.  Shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> great color for an americaqn mani</li>
    <li> Funny Bunny is by far my favorite color.</li>

    <li> Love this color. Very fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Funny Bunny goes on sheer, so it will take up to three coats if you want an opaque look.  This is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; polish for all events.</li>
    <li> sheerer than expected!</li>

    <li> Creamy milky white, so pretty, esactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I have tried to use other pale colors and I always return to this one. I also always get compliments on it. I am asked &amp;#34;what is that color you are wearing&amp;#34;! I use 3 coats and it covers with just a hint of transparency which makes it look natural not &amp;#34;painted&amp;#34; on like other opaque colors. The photo IMO doesn&#x27;t represent the natural look I achieve on my olive skin tone. Very professional for my vocation as a physician. Just on here to purchase another bottle!</li>
    <li> This color is very pretty but unfortunately you&#x27;ll need about 3-5 coats before it starts to look like the right shade.</li>
    <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been searching for...a light, white, opaque color. Funny Bunny is beautiful, not streaky like Essie Marshmallow.</li>
