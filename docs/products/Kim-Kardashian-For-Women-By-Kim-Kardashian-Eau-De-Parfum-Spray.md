<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have enjoyed the Kim Kardashian spray...just right not overpowering but just a pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> It smells great it smells alot likg gardenias. But it just to sweet for an everyday perfum....Its like a desert if you have it everyday you will get sick of it.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get this product but once received it smells great &amp; is a great value for the size. Love this perfume!</li>
    <li> I received it as a gift from my mother-in-law. This perfume has a very strong Cheap gardenia smell. By far the worst perfume ever.  Belongs at the Dollar Store.</li>
    <li> I did not like this at all.  My clothes still reek and I can&#x27;t seem to get the odor out.</li>
    <li> I love a good smelling woman!  So when I smelled this for the first time on my best-friend&#x27;s sister (her HUSBAND gave it to her), I knew I had to get it for my girlfriend...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, actually, I had to get past the fact that I was lining a Kardashian&#x27;s pocket with money first...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After struggling with that for 3 months, I finally pulled the trigger on my purchase...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS NOT disappointed one bit...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is AWESOME in the nose.  Personally, it reminded me of picking Tuberose for my Uncle and Aunt&#x27;s farm, right before we went to the country market down in Central Illinois.  Then putting some of them in a vase to emit their SWEET AROMA into the kitchen of my house...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though my brain can&#x27;t stand the idea of indirectly funding another reality TV show, that is prone to dumbing the children of AMERICA, my nose enjoys this perfume UBER-thoroughly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for perfumes, this is a GREAT one!!</li>
    <li> There is no way this perfume is the real thing. I read so many good reviews as well as some negative ones that said it was more of a horrible stench than a pleasant sent. Well I took a chance with it and I was so excited to when I received it (took two weeks for delivery, I live in central california if that matters) however, once I sprayed it on my wrist I couldn&#x27;t believe the terrible smell. I even sprayed it again to make sure it was the perfume. This can&#x27;t be the smell others are raving about.  When I tried to return the perfume they said the product wasn&#x27;t returnable. So disappointed in this order! Please buy at your local perfume store instead of this unreliable seller. They dont even deserve one star.</li>
    <li> Received the perfume in a timely matter.  I was very excited to try as I am a huge fan of the Kardashians.  I thought for sure this would be a winner.  Sprayed this on my wrist.  At first I thought it was ok, then I smelled it, it was putrid!!!  My hubby and I were on our way out...we got in the car and drove about a mile and we had to roll the windows down.  It was so overbearring.  My throat began to close and I got light headed.  Please note I do not suffer from allergies.  I have a high tolerance to smells.  I could not wait to get to a store with a wash room  to wash it off.  I disagree with the previous reviews.  I did not smell the flowers or fruit.  My personal favorite perfumes are Estee Lauder Pleasures and Philosophy Amazing Grace.  If  you like these then I doubt you will like this.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. Its unique.  Not that Im a Kardshian fan.  I saw it in the store and was attracted to the bottle and so I tried it.  I was suprised that it smells of gardenia.  I have always wanted a gardenia based scent thats lasts and is not to0 sweet and not too fruity.  I think the woodsy undertones give the scent some body without being too spicy.  Other&#x27;s reviews said that it didnt last long on them.  I know that jasmine and gardenia don&#x27;t typically last long, but in this case, I could still smell it after six hours.  Of course everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different.  This one suited mine.  My other favorite is Channel, Chance.  This one is nice to change it up a bit.</li>
    <li> I really like this scent - different from anything I&#x27;ve tried before.  It would be nice for work or an evening out.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle. Great price. Delivered withing like 3 or 4 days.. and a few extra samples in the box</li>
    <li> The imitation perfume my friend bought smelled better than the this. There are many great perfumes out there and I would suggest trying Chanel or Juicy!</li>
    <li> I love the packeging but the perfume is like a $10 perfume you buy in CVS discount store. I was so disappointed; I was going out and thought I put this on It has a funny strong smell and in 10 min is gone.  I would rate this as one star</li>
    <li> I wear this all the time and Im a man. I get compliments all the time. I love Kim. Shes flawless..</li>
    <li> Love this scent - very sexy</li>
    <li> I tried to find this in Sephora and all kinds of stores but it was sold out quick.  I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon for a good price.  :)</li>
    <li> I really liked the scent and picked up the gift set at CVS for $19.99.  I sprayed it on this morning and headed to work.  And then, OMG!!!! I started mucous-ing, could not clear my lungs, and was struggling to breathe.  This led to a panic attack and I prayed I would not die.  I drove to work with my window down all the while trying to wipe it off my wrists with a tissue.  Uh, it was 32 degrees this morning.  I thought I had some zyrtec in my desk at work but only found some sudafed.  I immediately took it and it seems to have stopped the reaction although I&#x27;m still light-headed from the lack of oxygen.  Might be OK for some but sadly, I have to get rid of it.  What a waste of money!  I do react negatively to some colognes but this by far, was the worse.</li>
    <li> The price I paid was great but like they say you get what you pay for. The bottle is pretty but the perfume it self is nothing special it smells exactly like womans Aspen there&#x27;s not much depth to it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on long. Not my favorite perfume I only use it at night after my shower because during the day it wont last.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this huge bottle of bliss!!! I absolutely die for gardenia so I am in heaven!!! Super reasonably priced and arrived on time!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a Kim Kardashian fan either. However, I was in TJ Maxx one day, and just happened upon this beautiful &amp; refreshing fragrance. Kim Kardashian&#x27;s perfume is different, it&#x27;s not the \\&quot;typical\\&quot; gardenia scent. At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the fragrance because I&#x27;m not a fan of someone who became famous from just being born. But, I tried 2 fragrances that day at the store: Britney Spears&#x27; &#x27;Curious&#x27;, and Kim&#x27;s fragrance. All I have to say is, I left the store, heading to another destination, and I found myself continuously sniffing my arm of both fragrances! Sad to say, Britney&#x27;s perfume didn&#x27;t even last 30 minutes on me (Curious), and I fell in love with Kim&#x27;s fragrance from the simple fact of it&#x27;s sillage and lasting fragrance impression. I love the gardenia,it&#x27;s not too floral, sweet or cloying AT ALL! I wasn&#x27;t sure if this perfume was going to make my \\&quot;favorites\\&quot; list. But the next day at church, I received a compliment from a total stranger who loved it as well....that&#x27;s when Kim Kardashian had me sold!! Can&#x27;t wait to try her other fragrance!!</li>
    <li> Amazon will not give me my money back for sending me a perfume that is not the same sold in stores. The Kim Kardashian perfume I received was either old, expired, or the person used the bottle and put in rubbing alcohol in it. I wish they would give me a refund but because it is a liquid, it is considered dangerous.  Do not buy this item, go to a store. they do not sell at sephora anymore, but I think it may be in some discount stores, target, or even a perfume store.</li>
    <li> Great service great gift</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas present. I didn&#x27;t specifically ask for it, but I am glad I got it! It smells great, and I wear it everyday now.</li>
    <li> I purchased Kim Kardashian perfume from The Buckle months ago for $50, after a $10 off special. I will continue to order this until it is no longer available. I love the smell and it lasts all day! :-)</li>
    <li> Old lady, expired perfume smell. Couldn&#x27;t give it away - had to throw it away. She sold out. Very bothersome considering her perfectionist attitude.</li>
    <li> Shipping was extremely fast. This is a huge bottle for an amazing price! Very potent scent.I could smell it all day and got a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> love the scent and i&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on it.  Although the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it used to when it first came out.  But still love it</li>
    <li> This person is only famous because she had a famous dad and she had sex. Don&#x27;t buy anything with her name on it.</li>
    <li> Good price and pleasant scent but one-note fragrance without depth.</li>
    <li> I really like this perfume! It smells like gardenia and jasmine! If you like the Kate Spade perfume, you will love this. I can&#x27;t even tell the difference between the two but Kim&#x27;s is a lot cheaper. I think for those who have complained that its too strong, you may have used too much. I need just one to two squirts and it lasts all day. I can see how applying more than that can get overwhelming. Overall, happy!</li>
    <li> The bottle didn&#x27;t look like the original kk logo fragrance was off</li>
    <li> Smells good but does not last more than 4 hrs...</li>
    <li> I received my perfume faster then I thought I would, it was bigger then I thought it would be and for an amazing price. I love the smell and will be buying more soon. Great product, great price and little to no wait.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, but when I bought the 3.4 oz amount online the fragrance didn&#x27;t seem as &#x27;strong&#x27; or barely there, it smells as if I&#x27;m just spraying straight alcohol on me. I have bought the 1 oz bottle from department stores and for some odd reason that seems to be better. I would recommend this to anyone but not to buy the 3.4 oz and to get the 1 oz. My husband hates perfume it just really bugs him he gets headaches if I or one of my daughters where it, but this perfume when I first started wearing it he seemed to like it. So I am back to just buying the 1 oz. even though it doesn&#x27;t last that long and is more expensive.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it she had no idea win it arrived and she kant stop wearing it and i also love the way it smells ............... i recomend this to everyone</li>
    <li> It take a lot for me to write a bad review but as much as I love Kim Kardashian, this perfume smells terrible to me. It has a very concentrated gardenia scent, which I never liked because it reminds me of a women&#x27;s retirement home. What really bothers me though is a strong resemblance to androstenone, a potent ingredient in male sweat. To some people it smells like vanilla and that would probably smell just fine (I&#x27;m assuming Kim smelled vanilla), but to others it smells like pungent stale urine. I smell gardenia and stale urine, and I am not fond of either. Research on it shows that most men can&#x27;t smell the androstenone at all, so maybe no guys would notice, but if a women walked by me smelling like this, I would guess she just got busy with a hobo. Sorry Kim.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my wife and she loved it.  Excellent price (about one half of what the major retail stores charge), fast and free delivery.</li>
    <li> had this not been a gift i never would have purchased it in the store. as a woman who loves perfume and the packaging, kim, half naked on a circle ring would not persuade me to purchase it. maybe if there was a man kissing her neck or something, that may entice me but her on the packaging...not so much. the scent isn&#x27;t so bad but again, the packaging is your 1st impression.</li>
    <li> Really great purchase. I would recommend it to all my friends and family. And the price was perfect. The delivery time was good and i would recommend people to go through Amozon to find products</li>
    <li> I am so completely annoyed that I LOVE this fragrance. . .NOT at all a fan of the Kardashian clan, BUT this stuff smells fabulous! I have had a sample of it for the longest time and finally decided to break down and buy the full size.  On me it is a sweet combination of gardenia and sandalwood.  Great cool weather fragrance but might be too strong in humid temperatures.  I just wish it was NOT KARDASHIAN. . .</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this scent when I smelled it in stores. Once I received this in the mail, I was more than disappointed with the longevity of the scent. When I tried this on in stores, one single spray followed me around for the rest of the day. This product required multiple sprays and disappears within a few minutes. Don&#x27;t buy online--worth it for the in-store price. These people will do anything for an extra buck.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and it&#x27;s just not for me at all. It&#x27;s way too strong and cloying&gt; Everything I hate about a perfume. I will be donating this to someone who might appreciate it.</li>
    <li> This perfume is very floral. I more into sweet and intimate smells. Personally, it makes me think of an old lady. I still wear it from time to time, but it is definitely not a sexy smell. It is more of a individual smell. I wouldn&#x27;t put it on for my significant other.</li>
    <li> Its a great price for a huge bottle of my fav perfume that i haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a young woman (30),  She loved it.  She is aware of Kim the celebrity and liked the product very much.  this product was recommended to me and I liked it too.  Very nice for either everyday use or for evening events. service from amazon was perfect too.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see so many negative reviews. I remember smelling this perfume at a Sephora when it first came out and absolutely loved the smell. I didn&#x27;t end up buying it the first time as I thought it was a bit too over priced. Then a year down the road, I saw it at a drug store for 20$ and bought it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the gardenia scents...like tuberose, jasmine, etc.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people don&#x27;t really like those smells and I prefer stronger, over powering perfumes vs. really light and fresh perfumes hence another reason as to why I like this smell and others may not. I find this to be similar to the Juicy Couture perfume that has a strong jasmine smell. I&#x27;m not sure why the Juicy Couture perfume has much better rating than the Kim K perfume. I&#x27;m assuming maybe because people hate Kim K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big fan of Kim K and find her a little pathetic, however I am not going to deny how amazing her perfume is.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume as a  gift with the shower gel and shimmering body lotion. I loved the smell but 3 stars because it doesn&#x27;t last long less than an hour and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like white florals in your perfumes you can give KIM KARDASHIAN a miss; It is basically a floral jumble and the only individual notes that stand out are the gardenia and tuberose, and that is it. The florals are so powerful that they instantly slap me in the face and hide almost everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The fragrance is one dimensional and boring, with very little difference between the top, heart and base; There was a short lived burst of lemon in the opening, then the jumble becomes heavier and sweeter and then the musk used in the base develops and joins in the mess [I&#x27;m not a fan of musk so I could do without it].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I assume they were going for old Hollywood glamour with the big white floral notes, but they went way too far with them - I personally can&#x27;t see anything glamorous, sexy or feminine about this fragrance, it seems screamingly, in-your-face loud, so - dare I say it? - it comes off as rather cheap and tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent notes: Mandarin, lemon, honeysuckle, orange blossom, jasmine, tuberose, gardenia, spices, Tonka, jacaranda wood, vanilla orchid, musk and creamy sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the first perfume I&#x27;ve tried in a while that I&#x27;ve wanted to wash off. Unfortunately the staying power is good as the floral jumble is headache-inducing strong. My bottle was a gift, so I felt duty bound to wear it, and I ended up with a migraine almost every time I dared put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not trying to be bitchy, but I ended up giving my bottle away, as it literally makes me ill to smell it now - even on other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; [No; I don&#x27;t have anything against Kim Kardashian herself. If you just don&#x27;t like this fragrance why are you instantly labelled as a bitchy, jealous &#x27;hater&#x27; or perfume snob?]</li>
    <li> Kim K perfume is a floral fragrance (Gardenias) It is very feminine and I like.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Exceptional!!!!!! Completely and safely package, we&#x27;ll done I&#x27;m very pleased with it and it arrived on time. :) 👍</li>
    <li> Was exactly what it was advertised as. Bought it online scent was exactly as department store item. Came packaged and sealed. I was completely satisfied with purchase... Was a better buy then department stores at a fraction of the price. I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Previous reviews exclaimed of ill scent etc.... If your unfamiliar with it research before you buy so your not disappointed, common sense. However, If you like the scent... It was exactly what I paid $25 in a portable roller ball at sephora for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> When I saw this perfume was only 30.00 I was ecstatic because my sister had purchased it at an upscale store in a casino for 70.00 I really thought I was getting a deal. When I opened it up and sprayed it, it smelled exactly like hers! I was so excited to have such an amazing smelling perfume for less than half of what she paid! I used only a couple sprays the first night I wore it to work because it&#x27;s a very strong perfume and the scent lasts all night long. Well, after a couple hours of wearing this perfume I could barely smell it on myself anymore. The next night I sprayed 4-5 sprays on myself, but still the same thing seemed to happen. I also noticed upon comparison that my sisters bottle is different than mine. The logo on the front of hers comes out where as mine is more like a sticker..... so I&#x27;m assuming this could be a fake. Oh well, you live you learn. I guess you do get what you pay for. It does smell exactly like hers, it just doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> I must admit, as a \\&quot;Kardashian fan\\&quot; I initially bought the Kim Kardashian perfume without even smelling it first because I love her classy style and expected her fragrance to live up to her image. It has a strong rich and creamy scent (not my usual choice in perfume scents) but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I will continue to use it until the bottle is empty but I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again. I am curious to see what her new \\&quot;gold\\&quot; fragrance smells like though. Hopefully it will be better than the original.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance so clean. Purchase this all the time just love it. I definitely recommend this fragrance you will enjoy it. :)</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this product from Amazon.  The price is reasonable and the fragrance is fabulous.  I will be purchasing in the future as this is my go to perfume.  I have had many compliments when I have it on.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this perfume. I bought it without testing the smell I the store first. The perfume was so inexpensive that I thought to try it out... Smells nasty and cheap...</li>
    <li> I got this over a year ago and the bottle is still half. I just do not love the scent. it has a cloying undertone that I cannot enjoy. the price was great though.</li>
    <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
    <li> love the perfume.  Light scent which is what I look for.  WOuld recommend.  Have gotten a lot of compliments when wearing this perfume</li>
    <li> Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s passion with a little fruity twist. My husband thinks it is great! I loved Taylor&#x27;s passion and this is almost but not quite as good as the original version. I love powdery, warm, florals with a bit of a sweet twist and this hits most of the markers for me. It is not aimed at very young teeny boppers either. I think a real woman of any age could wear this.</li>
    <li> Kim Kardashian for Women By Kardashian Edp Spray, 3.4 Ounce.. On time, really good perfume, perfect for going parties at night!!.. I recommed it.</li>
    <li> Love  this  perfume......you  offer  a  wonderful  price !!!  I  cannot  buy  this  anywhere  else  for  this  price - please  keep  it  available !!!  :)</li>
    <li> I would be wary of ordering perfumes online or from websites you don&#x27;t know, they alter the perfume.  Go to a store to buy Kim Kardashian&#x27;s perfume, it&#x27;s divine!  The scent is incredibly sultry and sexy.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite perfumes.  My husband loves the smell!  I did not purchase this perfume online but in the store, you have to try it. :)</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume. My friends all own it now as well. It&#x27;s such a bummer Kim is such a mess! I can&#x27;t stand her and I hate telling people it&#x27;s her perfume, but if she had anything to do with the scent (which I honestly doubt) then at least she has good taste in perfume!</li>
    <li> Definitely not the best perfume but it doesn&#x27;t smell horrible. Could be a lot worse for the price. More of a sweet smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful purchase, I love this colonge but it seems to not be on the market anymore.  I was very pleased to find it and make the purchase.  All was great, highly reccommend this site.</li>
    <li> This is a very strong floral scented perfume. It smells mainly of gardenia. Wears well but can be too strong, so spray less.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it great product !</li>
    <li> All item came on time and I love the fragrance!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my girlfriend, and it works great. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it is too much perfume. I would get the smaller amount.</li>
    <li> this perfume is the worst ever&lt;br /&gt;I think amazon send me a fake perfume&lt;br /&gt;the smell is just so cheap&lt;br /&gt;and they wont even return my money I am so disappointed</li>
    <li> This is one of the best EDP spray. I love it</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume! It last for about 5-6 hours. It&#x27;s a soft white floral with a spicy dry down. I get sooooooooo many compliments. I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Tested this scent in the store on one wrist with vera wang on the other. Definitely liked this one better. When I went into the store it was much more expensive so I bought it for $20 less here! I wore it for the first time today and it smells great. When I first put it on it wasn&#x27;t overpowering but you could definitely smell it. 8 hours later it has faded but I can still smell it.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume smells fresh &amp; clean, also living so far away from shopping love the convenience of ordering from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is the real thing, the bottle was not printed the same way as my original bottle that I bought from DASH. Still smells the same but it might be diluted . My own fault for only spending $20. Shipped fine .</li>
    <li> I would recommend this collection to any woman who likes to be remembered by her fragrance and having people ask what is that your wearing.</li>
    <li> Plastic bottle, smell was bad, I think it was a fake.</li>
    <li> Love this product need to order more soon.</li>
    <li> I have the michael kors perfume and this one smells JUST like it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviews said that it does not last long, but to me it does. -- certainly lasts longer than Jo Malones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of Kim Kardashian / celebrity perfumes, but the price was good and I like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, now clearly looking at the bottle I see some scratches on the KK Logo for some reason.....??? I am going to have to e-mail them about this :/</li>
    <li> Love the perfume, hate to buy it because it&#x27;s a Kardashian product...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the real one. I have the sample smell of this an the one I got smelled nothing like it.</li>
    <li> Fast, just as advertised, along with a couple of free samples. Better price than the Dash store.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the perfume! Smells great!!</li>
    <li> Even though it is KK fragrance I gotta say it is one of my favorite fragrances. What can I say. I am not big fan of her but this one is good one</li>
    <li> used as air freshener</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d buy this again. It smells sexy.</li>
    <li> This perfume does not smell good at all. So strong it was working on giving me a headache just by smelling the bottle I didn&#x27;t have it on. Don&#x27;t buy it unless you wanna smell like strong baby powder.</li>
    <li> I hate supporting the kardashians by purchasing this but I like the way it smells</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this. Very light. I think it smells identical to Michael Kors Very Hollywood, but at a much much better price. I have been buying this for several years.</li>
    <li> I cant stand Kim but could not find Kim Kardashian toilet paper so this was the next best thing my wife likes it.</li>
    <li> this item i received was a FAKE product. it was not the real kim K perfume because i have a real one and when comparing the bottles i could see discrepancies</li>
    <li> I thought it smelled great when I tested it in a store.  But when I received it and put it on it is very strong so you just need a teeny bit.</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrance.  Light and floral.  Would recommend.  Also, Amazon has the best price I have found around.</li>
    <li> This is hands-down one of the most atrocious perfumes I have ever had the displeasure to smell. Regardless of how I feel about Kim Kardashian, this stuff just smells god-awful. For the record, I am not a Kim K. hater and I&#x27;m not out to get her or whatever. I just think that her perfume smells really, really bad. I don&#x27;t really know what hand she personally had in making this, but whoever did make it obviously tried to make something that smells \\&quot;high end\\&quot; and it just fails miserably. Many of the notes in this particular fragrance are ones that I like (especially sandalwood, jasmine and the ambiguous \\&quot;crisp\\&quot; top notes) but somehow the balance is just totally off. This perfume manages to smell nasty and cheap at the same time, which I would assume is the exact opposite of it&#x27;s intent. I&#x27;m not a big fan of celeb-created scents, but this one really takes the cake as far as it&#x27;s awfulness goes. I see that this has been popular enough to earn a flanker, but I will get poked in the eye with a rusty butter knife before I smell that. There are plenty of better options for a warm, sultry, sensual scent, so try those instead. You might pay a little more, but at least you won&#x27;t smell gross.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my sister for Christmas and I LOVE the way it smells. I haven&#x27;t sent it to her yet but I know she&#x27;s gonna love it!&lt;br /&gt;I was kinda worried about getting a perfume as a gift, because I am extremely picky about perfume, but once I smelled this one I knew it was the perfect one. Definitely recommend this perfume!</li>
    <li> This is really cheap smelling parfume. My wife barley touches it. I guess its too late to exchange it, even though its only been sprayed twice.can you help me out?</li>
    <li> first off i never want to give the \\&quot;kartrashions\\&quot; any of my money ever but a friend gave me this perfume as a christmas gift so i thought id give it a try&lt;br /&gt;1. smelled like hospital grade rubbing alcohol when i sprayed it on me&lt;br /&gt;2. even the alcohol smell wore off about 45 minutes after that&lt;br /&gt;3. the publicity this product got made it seem like itd be a good product&lt;br /&gt;4. overall seems WAY cheap!!!</li>
    <li> I liked this perfume when I first got it, but I loved it when I got compliments mostly from men. It has a nice seductive smell but not overwhelming..</li>
    <li> Product smelled nothing like the original KKardashian i once had. Product smelled very cheap but at least customer service was understanding on the refund part of purchase. I will never purchase perfume online again.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells wonderful. I am a repeat buyer. Been using it since it first came out. I get many compliments and ppl are shocked when I tell them what it is. Guess they didn&#x27;t expect her perfume to smell good, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Nice and soft smell. I like it,but not love it.i do recommend it.and I do think its worth the money asked for.</li>
    <li> Had not smelled this fragrance prior to purchasing so I took a risk. Got it last week and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised to how much I like it.</li>
    <li> I am a huge kim kardashian fan so I decided to buy this I am in love I bought 2 of these Omg its sooooo niccceeeee😍😍😍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> My favorite scent ever!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scent!  Amazing and I will not be without it!</li>
    <li> Love it ! the smell is so good!. it came fast also</li>
    <li> The scent of this perfume is okay. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of it really but what made it really bad was that it just faded away! I sprayed my wrists and neck and after having it on for an hour, I noticed that I didn&#x27;t smell it anymore. I kept smelling my wrists but the perfume was completely gone!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product through Amazon.com and was very happy to receive it in a matter of three days.the spray was in a lovely package and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was exacatly as pictured.The scent was a little stronger than I liked but a little less of a spray worked to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the price was a great buy for such an elegant bottle of spray by Kim Kardashian and would recomend it to friends..</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of this product...Now the product can be shipped out , but we can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s classified has Hazardous, the smell is Hazardous....I was pleased my package came on time..Now I&#x27;m stuck with something I won&#x27;t use or give to anyone...I can&#x27;t even exchange it..All because I put the bottle to my noise and didn&#x27;t like the smell...Glad I didn&#x27;t use it on my skin..</li>
    <li> In all honesty..This perfume is just perfect. I wore it all throughout high school and after I ran out... I felt lost without it. So when I saw it on amazon.. I bought it with no hesitation! It smells amazing and I get compliments all the time. I would absolutely  tell all of my friends about it. It came in the mail in only two days.. the size is pretty big (which Is perfect) and the I experienced no bruises or damage to the product. I am very very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a white floral base fragrance.Very nice..</li>
    <li> I was gifted the little bottled size of this and I love it.  Not too strong or overpowering in scent but just right!  Hubby just loves this when i use it!.  Says its not too much or too strong but sweet and subtle as me  :) !</li>
    <li> i chose this rating because this perfume is the best ever and the only one i wear all the time it was a great price for a huge bottle and i will def be buying again .. best price best service</li>
    <li> I like the serivce and i recieved it very quick.</li>
    <li> Amazon is hands down the cheapest place you will find this perfume for 3.4 ounces.  I love this Kim, its the best of all of her perfumes, sweet but not too sweet and very sexy.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance and everyone compliments the smell. I&#x27;m ready for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> I always worry buying perfume online, and usually don&#x27;t because of fake products.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is authentic! It came sealed and smelled JUST like the sample I received from Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with it and the risk paid off this time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It smells fantastic.  The price is the best I have seen.  Will buy again in the future!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful perfume. Smells almost identical to Micheal Kors. The smell of gardenias really is strong and is very long lasting. I&#x27;m surprised. I get compliments all day.</li>
    <li> The scent was too strong!!!!! I personally don&#x27;t care for this scent it seems to fruity &amp; maybe something a child would like but should be a little tamed !</li>
    <li> This stuff here smells sooo amasing!! I got this as a get well present and i was floored when i opened it and see what it was. Because i was sick i had to wait to smell on it. And yes it was killin me to sniff it!! But imma tell ya hands down this is some good stuff. Usually im a britany spears wearer.. But srsly i couldnt be happier. My girl friends are jeal. Now i know what to get them for christmas. :)</li>
    <li> The seller was very accommodating! I bought this for my mom who lives in another state than me. I forgot to put her apartment number in the address so I was able to easily get in touch with the seller so they could add it even after it had shipped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom says the bottle is pretty big too! Happy mom, happy me!</li>
    <li> This one really suprised me.  I researched it and noted alot of people like it. Bought it without smelling it and it didn&#x27;t disappoint.  A good winter fragrance floral fragrance.  Very sensual.  The price is good for such a quality perfume.</li>
    <li> she wanted the perfume because she thought she liked the smell...but when she got it and started using it she decided she didn&#x27;t like it anymore.  that may be more of a statement on her and not the perfume though.</li>
    <li> It is a scent I can handle but it is very strong. Had to ask her to use it sparingly (which she said she only uses one spray now).</li>
    <li> I dont even know if this is a knock off. I compared the bottle to my original and the writing isnt the same as from as the print. The print was scratch on the bottle and it does not smell the same either. Waste of my money</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast, beautiful bottle .  I got it for a Christmas present, and my niece loved it.  For me I would have not gotten it, but for her, she loved it</li>
    <li> This totally a fake one, not the original one. The smelling is so bad, I was so disappointed. I can not believe this! I am a big fans to Kim&#x27;s perfume. Pay attention everyone! Look at the photo, the right one is original and the left one I bought from them is fake.</li>
    <li> Kim what were you thinking? This perfume is the worst I&#x27;ve smelt. It has a old lady and floral scent. I would never purchase this cheap perfume again , I should&#x27;ve just purchased another Lady Gaga fame perfume . Can I return this please ?</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this people compliment the scent !</li>
    <li> This is not the first time that I have worn this perfume. I saw that it had mixed reviews and felt that I needed to give it an excellent review...Yes, it is strongly scented, which works well for me because scents tend to dissipate quickly on me. I LOVE the scent and it works very well with my monoi body oil. The layering effect is near perfection for what I like in a scent. I will not be purchasing any different perfumes anymore and will be sticking with this perfume, which is saying a lot because I am constantly switching scents.</li>
    <li> Does not smell anything like it says. It has a very soapy, old lady smell. It does not have the sultry, dark scent that it advertised. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, and I love the price I paid for it too.  I ususally pay the same price for the smaller size in department stores.  And since it&#x27;s kind of old, it&#x27;s hard to fine else well.  If you are a fan of Michael Kors perfume, then you will love this Kim K&#x27;s perfume.  They smell the same, but less then half the price!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for 2 years now and I&#x27;m obsessed with it. Glad to find it at such a great price.</li>
    <li> Smell is strong and not pleasant, oh, and it also smells like a cheap perfume (had to give it away). In my opinion save yourself some extra cash and keep purchasing your expensive perfume.</li>
    <li> My sister thought the perfume was very nice. Coming from her, that&#x27;s a top endorsement</li>
    <li> Thank you for the quick delivery.  Perfect rating!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  Gardenia is one of my favorite scents!</li>
    <li> The product got shipped to me sooner then anticipated. This fragrance smells great. It&#x27;s feminine and unique. it is strong enough that you can smell it but isn&#x27;t overbearing and last for hours.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product and the price we paid for it. It saved us time since we didn&#x27;t have to go out for it.</li>
    <li> I received this perfume as a gift two years ago- my boyfriend and I both really liked it, and he is very picky. This scent is warm, well balanced, and not overpowering. I ran out and saw that this 3.4 ounce was only $23- great value. Bought it and smells just the same as before.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume and it went back right away! It has that old musty smell, nothing personal but it smells \\&quot;old\\&quot;. I Love Kim K but i am not loving this fragrance.</li>
</ol>
