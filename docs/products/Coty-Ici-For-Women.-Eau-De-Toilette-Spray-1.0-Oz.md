      <li>This is my favorite....</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wear many perfumes/scents as they give me headaches, but this one doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Neither has it available anymore, darn it!  </li>
      <li>But I had not been able to find it for quite awhile.  </li>
      <li>And I have to say that I like it on her. :)</li>
      <li>I love this sweet fragrance!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>When I wear it, I smell like sweet candy!  </li>
      <li>I have always used this product and love the fresh light scent.  </li>
      <li>The ones (had to buy two to get free shipping) from &lt;soap.com&gt;</li>
      <li>I was happy to have foud it for her one last time.</li>
      <li>This has been one of my favorite colognes for years and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for making it easy!</li>
      <li>Anyone who comes near me says I smell spectacular.  </li>
      <li>Ici is her favorite Eau De Toilette and the price on ebay is much better than anywhere else that it can be found locally.</li>
      <li>I like the fresh fragrance of Ici by Coty for Women.  </li>
      <li>The actual perfume was perfect, but the perfume box was extremely damaged which made me have to take it out to give it as a gift and the person did not know what it was.</li>
      <li>It was very easy and i will keep useing amazon for further ordering.</li>
      <li>Now, her granddaughters are borrowing it from her - a great floral scent, feminine, not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>A little pricy but good luck</li>
      <li>I love the cute little bottle, too!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>Thank you for giving me back the smell that I and my husband love so much!</li>

      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This product was exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
      <li>This is the only place I can find ICI which is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s nowhere near as strong or as lingering as it was when I bought it as a teen.</li>
      <li>I was very sad but happy that I could find it here!</li>
      <li>Walgreen&#x27;s and Meijer are the last stores to carry this product and most times is not stocked on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>It is hard to find in the stores, so it is nice to know that it still exists.  </li>
      <li>bottles are perhaps 2X larger than the one I got at Walmart, but the Parfum is worth finding.</li>
      <li>It was a fantastic buy, and I got a half dozen bottles in this</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, the Eau de Toilette is not as strong a scent as what I originally had (must&#x27;ve been an Eau de Parfum), so I have to say I&#x27;m not as enamored with it.  </li>
      <li>We gave it to my 85 year old mother in law for Christmas</li>
      <li>I use it frequently.</li>
      <li>This is very hard to find in stores, love this product, the only i will use.</li>

    <li> This is a nice sexy scent. Getting harder to find.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cologne!!!!!</li>
    <li> not over powering. bought this years ago for myself and always got compliments. We gave it to my 85 year old mother in law for Christmas and she loves it and excepts it for a gift and is disappointed  when she doesn&#x27;t get a bottle. She says she gets compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorite colognes for years and the price is very reasonable.  I use it frequently.</li>
    <li> The package arrived the day after I ordered it....how did they do that??  Unfortunately, the Eau de Toilette is not as strong a scent as what I originally had (must&#x27;ve been an Eau de Parfum), so I have to say I&#x27;m not as enamored with it.  The Parfum was $16 at Walmart (and before that, I got it for even less at a discount grocery store).  Neither has it available anymore, darn it!  The ones (had to buy two to get free shipping) from &lt;soap.com&gt; (via Amazon) were $23 each....bottles are perhaps 2X larger than the one I got at Walmart, but the Parfum is worth finding.</li>
    <li> The actual perfume was perfect, but the perfume box was extremely damaged which made me have to take it out to give it as a gift and the person did not know what it was.</li>

    <li> My mother used this and I did also for some time.  But I had not been able to find it for quite awhile.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this sweet fragrance!  When I wear it, I smell like sweet candy!  I love the cute little bottle, too! Will buy again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> The local stores no longer care this product! I was very sad but happy that I could find it here! Thank you for giving me back the smell that I and my husband love so much!</li>
    <li> The box was faded, as though it had been left in the sun too long. There are little particles floating in the bottle.</li>
