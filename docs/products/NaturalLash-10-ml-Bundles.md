### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
      <li>Very happy!</li>
      <li>Which is great because I used to get eyelash extensions</li>
      <li>/&gt;In case you also have thinning scalp hair like me, I have found that Amazon also carries a great shampoo for that.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use and the applicator worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff and have already seen great results after one week of use.</li>
      <li>I am so happy and will be using this stuff until the bottle runs out :)</li>
      <li>I was happy to be able to try this for my honest review.</li>
      <li>And my eyebrows are also thicker and more pronounced than before!</li>
      <li>Best of all, it REALLY DID WORK.  </li>
      <li>I love love this eyelash growth serum!</li>
      <li>It is so easy to apply!</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it does not irritate or burn your eyes which is very important to me!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s refreshing to know that there are businesses out there that still cater to the people buying their products.</li>
      <li>I wrote to the company and the gal told me she would advise me to order another and give it more time, reminding me of their 100% moneyback guarantee.</li>
      <li>I was told to make sure to get the product on my skin, NOT on my lashes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to see results in 2 weeks</li>
      <li>Perhaps I need to be more patient.  </li>
      <li>and I keep touching them as I noticed a difference almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Rubbing it in with my pinky seems to help, but I feel more like I&#x27;m rubbing it off, not in, and that may be delaying my treatment results.</li>
      <li>I have used other Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; products with great results, so I was hoping that I would see great results with this product also.</li>
      <li>I am so happy (and frankly surprised) to see that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product produces a real warm feeling where you put it right at first, but quickly fades.</li>
      <li>I have used Latisse and saw results very quickly.</li>
      <li>Applies easily and leaves no residue&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
      <li>This NaturalLASH is super!</li>
      <li>I love all of their products, I&#x27;ve had success with everything of theirs and tell all my relatives and friends about it.</li>
      <li>I want to add a couple of things that I feel might be important.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes have filled in in the areas that I had not lost lashes.  </li>
      <li>None except the price, and I am so happy to have full brows back, I will not complain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was definitely not disappointed.</li>
      <li>I think the price is reasonable and I absolutely LOVE that you can see through the tube so you can tell when you need to order more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am really happy with the results and I haven&#x27;t even used half of my original bottle yet.</li>
      <li>Glad to have found a new product thatdoes what it says!</li>
      <li>My first one ever!</li>
      <li>This one really worked!!</li>
      <li>I was so happy to see that because I almost looked like I was missing some of my brow.</li>
      <li>First of all, their customer service is stellar!</li>
      <li>I used the same product under their old name and am happy to say that you get the same fantastic results under the new name and packaging!!!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone who wants to improve on the thickness and length of their lashes!</li>
      <li>I really do believe that this product is worth a try.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working really well!</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s from a very dependable company!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Follow up: A few weeks later.......I am noticing lots more growth, especially in my eyebrows and my eyelashes look pretty good too.</li>
      <li>I like how easy it is to apply, simply draw on.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who wants longer, thicker lashes!</li>
      <li>That is important to me when I use something on my skin, especially with this being so close to my eyes.</li>
      <li>This NaturalLASH worked very well on my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>This filled in lashes that had fallen out and not grown back in!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover everything.</li>
      <li>and this seems to be doing the job very well.</li>
      <li>I was really bummed.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive)</li>
      <li>I should begin by mentioning that I have used so many different products over the last five years, (too many to list here), that have either done nothing, done very little, lost its effectiveness or caused so much discomfort that I had to discontinue use.</li>
      <li>It does burn a little, and on the safety side, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not something one would want to happen often.</li>
      <li>This particular product does not cause redness, itching, stinging or irritation of any kind, (at least, not for me</li>
      <li>, I have noticed new growth in my brows and a little in my eyelashes, but since both are sparse, the most I ask of these products I try, is that it helps me keep what I have</li>
      <li>and I have seen new growth in my eyebrows and lashes.  </li>
      <li>After about a month of applying in the morning and the evening, I now have seen my brows fill out with the growth of lots of new hairs.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and it does seem to lenghten a little and help lashes look healthy.</li>
      <li>I am looking for results but so far nothing.  </li>
      <li>One of the things that I like about Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; is that they use natural ingredients in their products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working slowly but surely</li>
      <li>so when I started my last try at NaturalLASH, I applied it that same way, right on the lash line upper and lower, and that&#x27;s when I really started seeing results.</li>
      <li>With other products like this that I had used the instructions were always to get the product right on the lash line</li>
      <li>Now, I can finally say without reservation, that this product absolutely does work, and works well, if you just have some patience (which I am a bit short on).</li>
      <li>There was major itching and&lt;</li>
      <li>Not much, but starting to see growth and notice my lashes are much stronger!</li>
      <li>Well,after using previous products of Smart Lash and Rapid Lash,thought i&#x27;d try this natural</li>
      <li>I am one who takes instructions very literally when working with something I&#x27;m not familiar with.</li>

<li> It has thickened and lengthened my lashes considerably since starting on my second tube, and I am about half way through that</li>
<li> I have pretty thick eyelashes, so I didn&#x27;t notice that big of a difference there, but I did notice a difference in my eyebrows.</li>
<li> When I was given the opportunity to review this product, I was overjoyed because I&#x27;ve longed to have my long eyelashes back.</li>
<li> I have gotten good at the application before makeup and am no longer disappointed there.</li>
<li> I do not wear mascara but may try gel and that may show a little something, eye brows also at this point haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth as advertised .My</li>
<li> What I mean, is, I quit using it several times because I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much</li>
<li> I found out -- the long way around -- that this product works.</li>
<li> Though I had been on a thyroid hormone replacement prescription supplement for a year and a half, the sparse brow hairs had not grown back in during that time, and so I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs</li>
<li> A little bit upset, this is my fourth week using it</li>
<li> The outer third of my eyebrows were missing due to my hypothyroidism according to my doctor.  </li>
<li> I utilized this product for five weeks and have noticed growth in the areas that had previous been hairless.  </li>
<li> You do want to pay attention to what you are doing when putting it on because I got a little hurried a couple of times and got it in my eye.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how careful I am with my application, there are always white clumps and flakes in my lashes which makes applying eyeliner and mascara difficult.</li>
<li> Also, the product consistency and color is a murky green and leaks out along the cap of my bottle.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks.</li>
<li> My eyelashes have always been thick and long, but lately they have been thinning.</li>
<li> this product is very irritating to the eyes that I couldn&#x27;t use it enough to found out if it works or not.</li>
<li> But I think it&#x27;s common sense that anything used around the eyes should be used with some caution</li>
<li> I like that it is very small because it makes it easier to control where I am applying it.</li>
<li> I have always had thin eye lashes that tend to stick together when using mascara.</li>
<li> I have never experienced any skin irritation using any of their products, including this one.</li>
<li> I have never experienced a company like this before</li>
<li> My eyebrows grew in where there were some very thin areas.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like how easy it is to apply, simply draw on.  Whether or not it is working is yet to be determined.</li>
    <li> A little bit upset, this is my fourth week using it and I don&#x27;t see any changes at all.</li>
    <li> Well,after using previous products of Smart Lash and Rapid Lash,thought i&#x27;d try this natural product.&lt;br /&gt;Oh my...total allergic reaction to it!  Rinsed it off and didn&#x27;t use it again. There was major itching and&lt;br /&gt;my eyes got very red and irritated.Next tried using it on brows but it didn&#x27;t seem to help any regrowth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and it does seem to lenghten a little and help lashes look healthy.</li>
    <li> My lashes looks thicker and fuller . Absolutely love it. I already got another one</li>
    <li> My eyelashes feel longer and healthier and I keep touching them as I noticed a difference almost immediately.  The instructions say to allow 4-5 weeks and I noticed a difference within 3-4 days.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I am looking for results but so far nothing.  Perhaps I need to be more patient.  I have used Latisse and saw results very quickly.</li>
    <li> Apply twice daily. Shows results after about 4 weeks, but keep applying 2x/day.</li>
    <li> I found out -- the long way around -- that this product works. What I mean, is, I quit using it several times because I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much and I was searching for something else. However, I didn&#x27;t find anything that sounded any different than this so then I&#x27;d get my product back out and start using it again. Finally, I kept with it and &amp;#34;thought&amp;#34; I was starting to see some improvement, but was still hesitant to re-order. I wrote to the company and the gal told me she would advise me to order another and give it more time, reminding me of their 100% moneyback guarantee. So I did.  Now, I can finally say without reservation, that this product absolutely does work, and works well, if you just have some patience (which I am a bit short on). It has thickened and lengthened my lashes considerably since starting on my second tube, and I am about half way through that so I figure I&#x27;ve still got room to grow.  And it does work on my eyebrows too.  P.S. I want to add a couple of things that I feel might be important. I was told to make sure to get the product on my skin, NOT on my lashes. I am one who takes instructions very literally when working with something I&#x27;m not familiar with. With other products like this that I had used the instructions were always to get the product right on the lash line so when I started my last try at NaturalLASH, I applied it that same way, right on the lash line upper and lower, and that&#x27;s when I really started seeing results. This product produces a real warm feeling where you put it right at first, but quickly fades. You do want to pay attention to what you are doing when putting it on because I got a little hurried a couple of times and got it in my eye. It does burn a little, and on the safety side, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not something one would want to happen often. But I think it&#x27;s common sense that anything used around the eyes should be used with some caution</li>
    <li> I sent this item back immediately. I used it one time and my eyes began itching and burning. The qtube states to discontinue use if this happens. I was really bummed.</li>
    <li> This NaturalLASH worked very well on my eyebrows. I have used other Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; products with great results, so I was hoping that I would see great results with this product also. I was definitely not disappointed. One of the things that I like about Prot&amp;eacute;g&amp;eacute; is that they use natural ingredients in their products. That is important to me when I use something on my skin, especially with this being so close to my eyes. There are also no parabens or sulfates, which is something else I look for in skin products. I have never experienced any skin irritation using any of their products, including this one. The color of this serum looks brown when you see it in the tube, but it doesn&#x27;t look brown when you apply it. The brush is very tiny, but I had no problem sweeping it across the roots of my lashes and my brows. I like that it is very small because it makes it easier to control where I am applying it. It doesn&#x27;t take much to cover everything. It leaves a slight wet feeling, so I knew when I had covered an entire area, It does dry fairly quickly though. I have pretty thick eyelashes, so I didn&#x27;t notice that big of a difference there, but I did notice a difference in my eyebrows. My eyebrows grew in where there were some very thin areas. I was so happy to see that because I almost looked like I was missing some of my brow. I was happy to be able to try this for my honest review.</li>
    <li> The only thing it did for me was burn my eyes!</li>
    <li> I had been put on a medication that caused my eyelashes to fall out.  I utilized this product for five weeks and have noticed growth in the areas that had previous been hairless.  My eyelashes have filled in in the areas that I had not lost lashes.  Very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my lashes since using this product.  Granted the directions say to use it twice a day, and I only use it at night because it stings your eyes enough to make them water.  You can&#x27;t put it on in the morning and then put on your eye makeup.  Definitely would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I just have two weeks putting  it on and I notice that my eyelashes  are fuller and longer then they use to be I&#x27;m so glad to see results in 2 weeks even tho the bottle says after 5 or 8 weeks so I&#x27;m very happy with it I can&#x27;t wait to see what this product  can do after 16 weeks</li>
    <li> this product is very irritating to the eyes that I couldn&#x27;t use it enough to found out if it works or not.</li>
    <li> I love all of their products, I&#x27;ve had success with everything of theirs and tell all my relatives and friends about it. I used the same product under their old name and am happy to say that you get the same fantastic results under the new name and packaging!!! Which is great because I used to get eyelash extensions and they made my lashes fall out, but his has restored them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff and have already seen great results after one week of use. Not much, but starting to see growth and notice my lashes are much stronger! I am so happy and will be using this stuff until the bottle runs out :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working slowly but surely</li>
    <li> Keep at it!  I apply every night for 1 month and I have seen new growth in my eyebrows and lashes.  It takes a while, but I definitely see improvement!  I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now. First of all, their customer service is stellar! I have never experienced a company like this before, it&#x27;s refreshing to know that there are businesses out there that still cater to the people buying their products. I should begin by mentioning that I have used so many different products over the last five years, (too many to list here), that have either done nothing, done very little, lost its effectiveness or caused so much discomfort that I had to discontinue use. This particular product does not cause redness, itching, stinging or irritation of any kind, (at least, not for me and I&#x27;m pretty sensitive), I have noticed new growth in my brows and a little in my eyelashes, but since both are sparse, the most I ask of these products I try, is that it helps me keep what I have and this seems to be doing the job very well. The four star review is for personal reasons because of the twice daily application. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how careful I am with my application, there are always white clumps and flakes in my lashes which makes applying eyeliner and mascara difficult. I am still fiddling with a solution to that. Rubbing it in with my pinky seems to help, but I feel more like I&#x27;m rubbing it off, not in, and that may be delaying my treatment results. I really do believe that this product is worth a try. I think the price is reasonable and I absolutely LOVE that you can see through the tube so you can tell when you need to order more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up: A few weeks later.......I am noticing lots more growth, especially in my eyebrows and my eyelashes look pretty good too. My review is now a five star review and I have purchased another bottle with the coupon given to me by the company, (bonus!). I am really happy with the results and I haven&#x27;t even used half of my original bottle yet. I have gotten good at the application before makeup and am no longer disappointed there. Glad to have found a new product thatdoes what it says!</li>
    <li> I have always had thin eye lashes that tend to stick together when using mascara. I have never used a lash growth product before. This one really worked!! I started noticing a difference in about 8 days of use. It was easy to use and the applicator worked wonderfully. I will def be using this all the time now!!! It&#x27;s a thing lash girls DREAM! I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone who wants to improve on the thickness and length of their lashes! A discount was given for my review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day for over 2 weeks now on my eyelashes and brows. I have not seen any results at all. Also, the product consistency and color is a murky green and leaks out along the cap of my bottle. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did not order this product</li>
    <li> Maybe to soon hopefully but at this point I&#x27;ve seen no results. I do not wear mascara but may try gel and that may show a little something, eye brows also at this point haven&#x27;t noticed any new growth as advertised .My product it getting to the bottom so at this point not about a repurchase.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be the same [i.e., same ingredients and type of wand/brush for appliying] as EmbelLash (now discontinued and replaced with NaturalLASH Amazon says).  The outer third of my eyebrows were missing due to my hypothyroidism according to my doctor.  Though I had been on a thyroid hormone replacement prescription supplement for a year and a half, the sparse brow hairs had not grown back in during that time, and so I tried this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;-- Applies easily and leaves no residue&lt;br /&gt;-- No noxious or medicinal smell or any discomfort like tingling or anything&lt;br /&gt;-- Best of all, it REALLY DID WORK.  After about a month of applying in the morning and the evening, I now have seen my brows fill out with the growth of lots of new hairs.  I am so happy (and frankly surprised) to see that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not associated with the company that makes, and I purchased it when named EmbelLASH through Amazon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;-- None except the price, and I am so happy to have full brows back, I will not complain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you also have thinning scalp hair like me, I have found that Amazon also carries a great shampoo for that.  &amp;#34;VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo&amp;#34; with biotin and Procapil by Nourish Beaute, I will post a review of that product there.</li>
    <li> I love love this eyelash growth serum! My eyelashes have always been thick and long, but lately they have been thinning. When I was given the opportunity to review this product, I was overjoyed because I&#x27;ve longed to have my long eyelashes back. It is so easy to apply! Most importantly, it does not irritate or burn your eyes which is very important to me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks. It&#x27;s working really well! To the point that now I had to go out and buy a lash curler! My first one ever! This NaturalLASH is super! And it&#x27;s from a very dependable company! This filled in lashes that had fallen out and not grown back in! They&#x27;re lighter now, but mascara does wonders! And my eyebrows are also thicker and more pronounced than before! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants longer, thicker lashes!</li>
