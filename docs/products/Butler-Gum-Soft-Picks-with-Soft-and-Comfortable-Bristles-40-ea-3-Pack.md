      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others including Stim-U-Dent and the ever popular Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks which are also available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My last visit to the hygienist was the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>I find these picks to be even better at getting between teeth than dental floss.  </li>
      <li>These by comparison feel better, but also seem to do the job better as well.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>

      <li>My dental hygenist gave me some at my last cleaning and  they are so easy to use and make my teeth and gums feel great after eating.  </li>
      <li>but they are a great addition to regular flossing.</li>
      <li>They fit between my teeth regardless of the width between them.</li>
      <li>but then these will get your teeth squeaky clean, literally.  </li>
      <li>I found similar picks when I was overseas and these are just as good.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to use these picks and order more, as they are really efficient at removing debris.</li>
      <li>These are a dream come true.</li>
      <li>The one thing is that they do fall apart fairly quickly so if you want to use instead of floss the durability might be an issue.</li>
      <li>This little soft picks are awesome.  </li>
      <li>They feel really good against the gums, not as abrasive and hurtful as some other picks out there.</li>
      <li>It is a clever useful product!</li>
      <li>These little guys are so easy to use and have around that I floss far more now than I ever did!</li>
      <li>(Also the first one I used bent easily because I wasn&#x27;t lined up properly between molars.)</li>
      <li>The plastic is not so rigid as to harm the gums, but strong and flexile enough not to bend or crack.</li>
      <li>This is a great little product that is easy to use; and also is portable (comes with a little plastic snap case).</li>
      <li>The improvement from the deep cleaning was good, but not nearly as good and as easy as the improvement that was quickly achieved through my using these Soft Picks.</li>
      <li>Preferring another brand and not using these much.</li>
      <li>The gentle massage is beneficial to the gums.  </li>
      <li>Quantity buys eliminate time shopping and much cheaper</li>
      <li>She wanted to know what I had been doing as the deep pockets in my gums had significantly improved.</li>
      <li>These are the only things that clean out between some of my dental work.</li>
      <li>and I love the little carry case since I am always traveling.</li>
      <li>However the directions clearly state not to force them.</li>
      <li>Soft and flexible</li>
      <li>I have been using these G-U-M Soft Picks for about 6 months now.</li>
      <li>I like these soft picks.  </li>
      <li>I particularly like the way they work in-between the back molars.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that because these actually have tiny little rubber brushes on them, that my gums feel squeaky clean after using them, much cleaner than if I&#x27;d just used floss.</li>
      <li>I sometimes will floss and then use the soft pick and am still able to get out other small particles of food.</li>
      <li>I made an experiment by flossing first and then using one of these, and the pick removed material trapped between my teeth that the floss did not reach.  </li>
      <li>I was not aware that the “picks” were so small and not as easy to hold grip and use.</li>
      <li>Two weeks of using one every night in problem areas and then flossing other areas normally</li>

    <li> Whether you have your own teeth or have implants and crowns, this is by far the very best dental tool i have ever used.  It easily fits between teeth and releases debris that gather there after eating.  The gentle massage is beneficial to the gums.  The product is light and easy to handle and of course disposable.  I&#x27;ve used many dental products before but this is by far the best, and my dentist put me on to it and is pleased with the health my gums have now.</li>
    <li> I have been using these G-U-M Soft Picks for about 6 months now. They feel really good against the gums, not as abrasive and hurtful as some other picks out there. I&#x27;ve tried many others including Stim-U-Dent and the ever popular Doctor&#x27;s Brush Picks which are also available on Amazon. I found those to be very stiff and hard against my gums and they felt like you could literally do some damage if used incorrectly. These by comparison feel better, but also seem to do the job better as well. I have both small tight gaps as well as larger gaps between my teeth. These work well in all of them. I particularly like the way they work in-between the back molars. I sometimes will floss and then use the soft pick and am still able to get out other small particles of food. I find that you will need two of them to finish the job in the mouth. One for the upper teeth and one for the lower teeth. What happens is that sometimes when you are using them in the back molars, the tip will bend and once that happens it is hard to use it anymore, so I always start with the front teeth and then move towards the back. I&#x27;ve noticed that because these actually have tiny little rubber brushes on them, that my gums feel squeaky clean after using them, much cleaner than if I&#x27;d just used floss. As they say, the proof is in the pudding: My last visit to the hygienist was the best I&#x27;ve ever had. She wanted to know what I had been doing as the deep pockets in my gums had significantly improved. About 5 years ago I had to go through the painful process of a deep cleaning where they have to numb a quarter of your mouth at a time so that they can clean below the gum line in an attempt to help improve the size of the pockets in the gums surrounding the teeth. This is a laborious process that took four visits to the dentist. Trust me, it&#x27;s better to not have to get to the point where this is needed! The improvement from the deep cleaning was good, but not nearly as good and as easy as the improvement that was quickly achieved through my using these Soft Picks.</li>
    <li> These were recommended by my dental hygenist so I gave them a try.  I carry them in my purse and keep a pack in my desk at work for \\&quot;emergencies\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t belive they take the place of regular dental floss but they are a great addition to regular flossing.</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with bleeding when I floss. At my last check up my dentist handed me a small pack of these to try. THEY WORK GREAT! Two weeks of using one every night in problem areas and then flossing other areas normally and my bleeding problem is gone. The green rubber tip is very comfortable compared to similar products with thin metal wire and plastic bristles. The tip may go limp if you try to force it into a gap between teeth that is too small. However the directions clearly state not to force them. (Also the first one I used bent easily because I wasn&#x27;t lined up properly between molars.) I have not had a problem using one and rinsing it with alcohol and using it again to make them last longer.</li>
    <li> I was not aware that the “picks” were so small and not as easy to hold grip and use.</li>
    <li> I found similar picks when I was overseas and these are just as good.  These are the only things that clean out between some of my dental work.</li>
    <li> Butler Gum Soft-Picks are wonderful for crowns and bridges.  And they massage the gums while getting rid of the tartar and gunk between the teeth.  I have recommended this product to family, friends, and best of all, to my DENTIST who now wants to recommend the soft-pick to the patients.&lt;br /&gt;My gums feel clean and healthy after using the Gum Soft-Pick.</li>
    <li> Good deal. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> These things are great.  Much better than a wood or plastic toothpick.</li>
    <li> These are great for keeping in my purse for a discreet cleaning after eating in a restaurant.</li>
    <li> I like these soft picks.  Easy to use, although after I do a few teeth the tip usually gets bent.  But, I have little space between some of my teeth so that is the reason that happens.  Good product, worth the money, and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> These little guys are so easy to use and have around that I floss far more now than I ever did!</li>
    <li> This is a great little product that is easy to use; and also is portable (comes with a little plastic snap case). The plastic is not so rigid as to harm the gums, but strong and flexile enough not to bend or crack.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I anticipated</li>
    <li> Works very good for getting between my teeth and I love the little carry case since I am always traveling.</li>
    <li> It is a clever useful product! It comes with a carrying case which makes it practical and handy to use.</li>
    <li> recommended by my dentist and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are great! My dental hygenist gave me some at my last cleaning and  they are so easy to use and make my teeth and gums feel great after eating.  Try em, you&#x27;ll like em!</li>
    <li> Quantity buys eliminate time shopping and much cheaper</li>
    <li> I find these picks to be even better at getting between teeth than dental floss.  I made an experiment by flossing first and then using one of these, and the pick removed material trapped between my teeth that the floss did not reach.  Very satisfied with them.  My only small complaint is at times they bent sideways or break off, but the latter rarely happens.  I will continue to use these picks and order more, as they are really efficient at removing debris.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a flosser.  Never have used toothpicks, but saw these advertised on TV.  I have really tight contacts between my teeth, so flossing is difficult.  Unbeknownst to me, I still had gunk between my teeth after flossing.  This little soft picks are awesome.  Yes, still floss, but then these will get your teeth squeaky clean, literally.  I love them.</li>
    <li> Preferring another brand and not using these much.</li>
    <li> I agree with the previous reviews. These are fantastic, they massage your gums and do a great cleaning job. The one thing is that they do fall apart fairly quickly so if you want to use instead of floss the durability might be an issue. But if you want to use instead of a toothpick after meals or whatever. These are a dream come true.</li>
    <li> Soft and flexible, these picks get where hard picks can&#x27;t reach. They fit between my teeth regardless of the width between them. A great invention!</li>
    <li> Soft and flexible so you will never injure your gums. Won&#x27;t splinter and easily fits between teeth. I won&#x27;t be without these.</li>
    <li> It cleans without hurting my gums.. Love it</li>
