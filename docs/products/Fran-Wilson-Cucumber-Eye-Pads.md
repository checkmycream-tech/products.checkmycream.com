      <li>Actual cucumber slices work better than this.</li>
      <li>shower put on the nourish y eyes and it is pure bliss.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing to the eyes and very relaxing.</li>
      <li>pack of 2 is very deceiving thought I would receive a pack of two jars of fran wilson</li>
      <li>the product doesn&#x27;t do much and it stings my husbands eyes.</li>
      <li>Other than these two cons, I do love the product.</li>
      <li>Refreshing, gets rid of the under eye puffiness and dark circles.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it, cool feeling, but no result, after using my eye still look the same,</li>
      <li>I chose this product to have quick cooling relief when I get back from work or from the swimming pool.  </li>
      <li>I have previously experienced a more expensive brand causing my skin to burn a little.  </li>
      <li>Lovely smell, green tea and cucumeber.</li>
      <li>For my use, the size of the pads is just right, as they cover the entire eye.</li>
      <li>The sanitary, plastic tweezers are not sharp enough to grab an eye pad at the first attempt.</li>
      <li>The cucumber nourishing liquid leaked completely out of the jar and soaked the box.</li>
      <li>I use it in the morning for about 10 minutes before a busy work day with presentations.</li>
      <li>I love this product, especially when actual cucumbers are not available.</li>
      <li>They are very refreshing for tired, dry or allergy eyes.</li>
      <li>It sure helps itchy tired eyes.</li>
      <li>It just takes a few minutes for them to work and it&#x27;s worth every second.</li>
      <li>Due to the above reasons, I do not use them as much as I should.      </li>

<li> Really unfortunate because I would have been a return customer, but can&#x27;t even try the product because there&#x27;s nothing left on the pads to work.</li>
<li> I use these at night, at least once a week.</li>
<li> The pads are so thin they immediately heat up after you take them out of the fridge.</li>
<li> Whenever I wake up with those infamous bags under the eyes, I reach for Fran&#x27;s cucumber pads.  </li>
<li> What a disappointment!</li>
<li> so I had a base comparison (Earth Therapeutics).      </li>
<li> very disappointed</li>

    <li> Whenever I wake up with those infamous bags under the eyes, I reach for Fran&#x27;s cucumber pads.  Within minutes my eyes are refreshed and I feel attractive once again.  I&#x27;ve used other products but they have indeed proved inferior.  Hers are always moist and cool to the touch.  It just takes a few minutes for them to work and it&#x27;s worth every second.</li>
    <li> I had used these years ago, but when my supply ran out, I could no longer find them in a store.  I love them!  They are so soothing on my eyes if I have: not had a good night&#x27;s sleep, kept my contact in too long, suffer from puffy eyes OR for no reason at all except they make my eyes feel refreshed.  Also a great incentive to just lie down for 10 minutes and relax!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it, cool feeling, but no result, after using my eye still look the same, sucks!cool feel I like so 2star</li>
    <li> These were cooling and soothing on the eye but not did not take away the puffiness as I had wanted them too, like therapeutic ones did.</li>
    <li> I had a previous brand of cucumber pads so I had a base comparison (Earth Therapeutics).      These are much smaller; as such, they are a struggle to keep on eyes.  They dry out much faster , so not happy there (perhaps because they are not individually wrapped but in jar).    Due to the above reasons, I do not use them as much as I should.      I will use them until they are done, but will move on or go back to previous brand.</li>
    <li> Love these. I used them and then asked my husband if he would like to try a couple. He did and also loved them. Saving the rest to use right before my grandson&#x27;s wedding! They are so cool and refreshing - really work.</li>
    <li> I have loved these eye pads for a few years now and just ordered more from Amazon.I keep a jar in the fridge tightly closed and I have never had any problem with them staying moist. They are very refreshing for tired, dry or allergy eyes. Even though I have eyedrops for allergies, sometimes nothing will work for me except reclining with these cucumber eye pads on for 20 minutes. I have tried other similar products and liked them, but these particular eyepads seem to be the most cost effective, and have never caused any irritation to my skin. I have previously experienced a more expensive brand causing my skin to burn a little.  For my use, the size of the pads is just right, as they cover the entire eye. I gently mold them to fit my eyes as that is the area I need help soothing.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. The pads are so thin they immediately heat up after you take them out of the fridge. I noticed absolutely no benefit, they do smell good though. Honestly this is just a bad idea. Natural sliced cucumbers work much better.</li>
    <li> These are nice, cool, soothing pads for the eyes.  You could also put the container in the fridge so that it&#x27;s extra cooling and rejuvinating to the eyes.  When I do a facial, I&#x27;ll apply a face mask and then add these cucumber pads to my eyes.  I&#x27;ll also just use the cucubmer eye pads with one of those beaded gel masks to just sooth and relax my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have puffy or baggy eyes so I can&#x27;t honestly say whether these would help with that or not, but I do know that they just feel nice and nourishing to my skin.</li>
    <li> Really works and soooo soothing for tired eyes.</li>
    <li> Refreshing, gets rid of the under eye puffiness and dark circles. Lovely smell, green tea and cucumeber. Great start to my morning routine.</li>
    <li> Good product, description, in accordance with the instructions to use it though no special effects, but still good Good product, description, in accordance with the instructions to use it though no special effects, but still good</li>
    <li> These feel nice on my eyes, nothing amazing, but nice.  A good add on to face mask when you are treating yourself.</li>
    <li> It sure helps itchy tired eyes. Use it all the time when allergies act up. You could use real cucumber slices instead, but who has that available, when you need it, plus it works better !!!</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and super cooling.</li>
    <li> I use these at night, at least once a week. My eyes feel refreshed. Great for people with dry eye like me!</li>

    <li> Great product. It actually works-reduces bags and swollen eyelids. I use it in the morning for about 10 minutes before a busy work day with presentations. Also makes you have that refreshed look. Love it.</li>
    <li> These little cucumber pads are excellent!  I am an aesthetician and I use these for my clients.  The scent is light and I actually see a bit of puffiness reduction when they stay on for about 5 - 10 minutes while their mask is actively working.</li>
    <li> I would give it ZERO stars if I could. Please explain to me why there was a sealed plastic type of bag around the box, but not around the jar inside the box? The cucumber nourishing liquid leaked completely out of the jar and soaked the box. There was nothing left in the jar. Really unfortunate because I would have been a return customer, but can&#x27;t even try the product because there&#x27;s nothing left on the pads to work. What a disappointment! Not worth the pain to return for a refund.</li>
    <li> I love the product, however; there are two cons for me. 1) I wish they would adhere better. They do well at first but then begin to loosen 5 minutes before taking them off. 2) The sanitary, plastic tweezers are not sharp enough to grab an eye pad at the first attempt. Other than these two cons, I do love the product. The cons for me do not out weigh the pros, therefore; I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love these.  i order them all the time and I have given them to friends.  Very soothing to the eyes and very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially when actual cucumbers are not available. This is a nice, at home, spa treatment.</li>
    <li> I have tried every eye product out there and this is simple the best and its simple.  You can buy cucumbers and soak them in green tea too</li>
    <li> These are great!  I keep them in the fridge, so they are chilled when I need them.  Great for travel too.  Put some in a plastic bag to take with you.</li>
    <li> Buy them all the time.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Nice packaging but the product doesn&#x27;t do much and it stings my husbands eyes.</li>
    <li> These are very refreshing.  I keep the jar in the refrigerator so they feel so good on my eyes while I am relaxing in the evening.</li>
    <li> pack of 2 is very deceiving thought I would receive a pack of two jars of fran wilson nourish my eyes cucumber pads  very disappointed</li>
