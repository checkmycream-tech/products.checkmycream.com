      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Very good product!</li>
      <li>Great coverage but not the best almay&#x27;s concealer you can buy.</li>
      <li>I think the color is very nice as well as the coverage, blending and texture.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and was so happy to find it online since stores stopped carrying it!</li>
      <li>A courteous seller and a smashing product!</li>
      <li>The cover up is really good under foundation.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for spot treatment.  </li>
      <li>The treatment gel is salicylic acid and is good for drying up blemishes.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t good for under-eye brown; but good to cover sun spots, blemishes, etc.  </li>
      <li>Get coverage and good product.</li>
      <li>I like this product because it is affordable and it provides good coverage.</li>
      <li>Also, this is an Almay product, so I knew I could trust it, and the price is super great!</li>
      <li>Also, I am pretty fair, and I knew that the concealer didn&#x27;t perfectly match my skin, but I use it under my eyes and on my cheeks, and it blends in nicely as I get tanner.</li>
      <li>I love this coverage!</li>
      <li>It is kind of oily.</li>
      <li>applies and blends nicely and helps heal acne.</li>
      <li>I love love love this product!!</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t help with blemishes, acne, or spots but the concealer is pretty great at coverage.</li>
      <li>and like it but and have not been able to find it in the store anymore.</li>
      <li>Love this concealer.  </li>
      <li>I love this case.</li>
      <li>As for the color -  I meant to get the light/medium which works better, but it&#x27;s winter, so I guess the lighter works okay.  </li>
      <li>It has OK staying power</li>
      <li>consealer is awesome but the gel only worked for one day bc</li>
      <li>I am so glad i purchased it.</li>
      <li>I think it is a pretty good cover up</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive, acne-prone skin</li>
      <li>I thought the Light Medium might be even better</li>
      <li>If is a good cover up, but she doesn&#x27;t like how much it needs to be rubbed in when applying.  </li>
      <li>Rub your finger over the concealer to get as much as needed, using the heat of your fingers to warm up the product.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to get right color for your complexion.  </li>
      <li>Went straight to the trash can!!!</li>
      <li>I was originally searching for a concealer, and the correcting liquid was just an added bonus for me.</li>
      <li>The concealer is also very build-able, but I recommend powdering it to make sure it stays it place because it does slip off throughout the day.</li>
      <li>This item almost wins except for the smell.</li>
      <li>The most light weight you can get, but still have it actually work!</li>
      <li>I actually bought 3 different cases before I saw this one and this one is by far the best!</li>
      <li>I like the combo very much (treatment plus cover) and recommend it.  </li>
      <li>so glad to have found this online after seeing it is no longer carried in any local stores.</li>
      <li>Color was good, and blended in with my pale olive skin pretty well.</li>
      <li>It is easily spread due to creamy light texture.  </li>
      <li>I love the stuff -- wish that I didn&#x27;t have to dip the sponge with it&#x27;s accompaning skin cells, back into the treatment gel, but I do anyway because the gel really works for me.  </li>
      <li>only if used with powder to set it, otherwise it smears easily.</li>
      <li>Really does help reduce redness &amp; conceal blemishes ..</li>
      <li>Spend the few extra dollars on a better product for sure</li>
      <li>Covers really well.</li>
      <li>I have pretty clear skin, but we all have those times where a couple issues pop up.</li>
      <li>It covers well, but there&#x27;s an odor to it that my daughter is very sensitive to.  </li>
      <li>I got this for my 14 year old daughter.  </li>
      <li>I only apply first thing in the morning and then again before bed, and it&#x27;s either gone the next day, or maybe one day after that.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t extremely light - I have light/fair freckled with some uneven (red) skintones.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it easily melts, so if you have it in your purse on a hot summer day you will have a big mess.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what it does, but the green liquid part clears up any spots I get in a day or two.</li>
      <li>I have some sun since live in FL but not very tan at all.  </li>
      <li>I actually never use the concealer portion so that&#x27;s hard for me to review, but it&#x27;s 100% worth it for the acne treatment.</li>

<li> Usually when you use a creamy concealer it blocks your pores but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to have that issue.  </li>
<li> It was much less expensive than other options, but has all the quality.</li>
<li> I think it made my skin problems worse.</li>
<li> Had an awful smell and the goop on the other end is hardly a &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> I ordered it here but was given the wrong shade, in the packing of the shade I asked for.</li>
<li> Is it supposed to have this awful chemical scent?</li>
<li> Disgusting chemical smell!!!!!</li>

    <li> A courteous seller and a smashing product!</li>
    <li> I love the stuff -- wish that I didn&#x27;t have to dip the sponge with it&#x27;s accompaning skin cells, back into the treatment gel, but I do anyway because the gel really works for me.  As for the color -  I meant to get the light/medium which works better, but it&#x27;s winter, so I guess the lighter works okay.  I wish Almay still marketed the &#x27;concealer plus treatment&#x27; but since they don&#x27;t anymore, I&#x27;ll continue to buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This item almost wins except for the smell. It has a mildewy sort of scent that is quite noticeable even after applying to the face! Yikes. It has OK staying power only if used with powder to set it, otherwise it smears easily. It did not bother my skin, and actually did seem to help heal blemishes. Color was good, and blended in with my pale olive skin pretty well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for spot treatment.  The cover up is really good under foundation.</li>
    <li> so glad to have found this online after seeing it is no longer carried in any local stores. applies and blends nicely and helps heal acne.</li>

    <li> I am very sad this product became discontinued, It has helped me so much with acne the past couple years. I suggest ALMAY make a similar product. Very good product!</li>
    <li> I having been using this for a while and like it but and have not been able to find it in the store anymore. I ordered it here but was given the wrong shade, in the packing of the shade I asked for. The stick itself says the shade it is (too dark) but the cardboard it is packaged in the shade I asked for. I&#x27;m guessing it was either repackaged or some sort of factory second.</li>
    <li> Usually when you use a creamy concealer it blocks your pores but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to have that issue.  I think the color is very nice as well as the coverage, blending and texture.  My only complaint is that it easily melts, so if you have it in your purse on a hot summer day you will have a big mess.</li>

I actually never use the concealer portion so that&#x27;s hard for me to review, but it&#x27;s 100% worth it for the acne treatment. I used to purchase it at Target, but they quit carrying it, so thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
    <li> The green stuff that came with the concealer doesn&#x27;t really do anything. It didn&#x27;t help with blemishes, acne, or spots but the concealer is pretty great at coverage. I recommend using a finger for application. Rub your finger over the concealer to get as much as needed, using the heat of your fingers to warm up the product. The concealer is also very build-able, but I recommend powdering it to make sure it stays it place because it does slip off throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product!! I was originally searching for a concealer, and the correcting liquid was just an added bonus for me. But, it turns out that the correcting liquid is AWESOME!!! I have pretty clear skin, but we all have those times where a couple issues pop up. In under 12 hours, I notice that the areas I used the liquid on are considerably less irritated and start to fade!

    <li> This stuff is genius. I am so glad i purchased it. Its a perfect match to my skin. As far as the &amp;#34;treatment gel&amp;#34; it&#x27;s just too soon for me to say if it works but in a few months i will update my review. Almay always makes wonderful products, I especially love their Duo eyeshadows for hazel eyes.</li>
    <li> Great coverage but not the best almay&#x27;s concealer you can buy. It is kind of oily. If your skin is oily I don&#x27;t suggest it for you.</li>
    <li> I love this product and was so happy to find it online since stores stopped carrying it!</li>
    <li> consealer is awesome but the gel only worked for one day bc my face oils got mixed in with the other gel inside and stopped working</li>
    <li> Get coverage and good product.</li>
    <li> Is it supposed to have this awful chemical scent?</li>
    <li> I love this case. It was much less expensive than other options, but has all the quality. I actually bought 3 different cases before I saw this one and this one is by far the best!</li>
    <li> Love this concealer.  I&#x27;m going to order the next shade darker when I order again. Covers really well.</li>
    <li> I use this daily for coverup and blending.  It works well; is not overpowering; has staying power; doesn&#x27;t cake.  It does need blending with/by my mineral powder and works well.  It is easily spread due to creamy light texture.  It isn&#x27;t good for under-eye brown; but good to cover sun spots, blemishes, etc.  The treatment gel is salicylic acid and is good for drying up blemishes.  I like the combo very much (treatment plus cover) and recommend it.  Just be sure to get right color for your complexion.  This isn&#x27;t extremely light - I have light/fair freckled with some uneven (red) skintones.  I have some sun since live in FL but not very tan at all.  This works well for me.  I thought the Light Medium might be even better but it is too dark for my face.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is affordable and it provides good coverage. I also like the fact that it had acne treatment in it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 14 year old daughter.  If is a good cover up, but she doesn&#x27;t like how much it needs to be rubbed in when applying.  Only uses it occasionally.  I think it is a pretty good cover up but she&#x27;s the one I got it for.....</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time Ive bought this product .. Really does help reduce redness &amp; conceal blemishes .. I use this often !</li>
    <li> Disgusting chemical smell!!!!! Went straight to the trash can!!! I can&#x27;t imagine putting it on my face!</li>
